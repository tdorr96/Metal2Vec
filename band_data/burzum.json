        "\nWell, it's about time somebody covered this split, so I'm gonna be the one to review it. Like all the other splits I've reviewed, I'll be reviewing each artist separately (or one artist in this case...)\n\nUruk-Hai\nAccording to Varg, Uruk-Hai was one of the first bands he formed, and he recorded four songs in the years 1988 - 1990 on a demo titled \"The Fighting Uruk-Hai\". In this demo, we see the young Varg flesh out some ideas that would later be utilized in future Burzum works. The first track in particular is a simple ambient piece that has a basic composition, but the vintage sound gives it more of a desolate atmosphere, and the calming keyboards further enhances the lonely feeling. As for the rest of the three tracks, it's just some electric guitar playing some fast and thrash-like riffs. However, in some portions of \"Blood-Red Scimitars\" and especially \"Mace Attack\", we hear some similar tunes that would later be used in \"M\u00f3ti Ragnar\u01ebkum\", which I think is pretty cool. In fact, I actually kinda prefer this version of M\u00f3ti Ragnar\u01ebkum than in Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, since the faster riffs gives it more of an energized tone, and it executes a better atmosphere than in the final version. \"The Fighting Uruk-Hai\" may not compare to the later works of Burzum, but as it stands, it is a pretty good demo.\n\nBurzum\nFor this side, these are some tracks that Varg recorded in prison before said prison took away his guitar. The production of the \"Wotans Verh\u00e4ngnis\" is more weaker than in Uruk-Hai's side, since the guitars sound more fuzzy and quieter. However, like Uruk-Hai, we do get some pieces that would foreshadow those in his next album Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, especially in the track \"Odinns Daudr\". And also like Uruk-Hai, I do prefer this version over the 1997 album, since the guitars have a more menacing sound in them that gives the tone of the track an eerie feeling. As for the ambient pieces like \"Hoddmimisholt\" and \"Epilogue\", they are also just as strong as with Uruk-Hai's ambient pieces, if not better. The poor production of \"Hoddmimisholt\" gives the synths a more creepy tone, and the howls in the background only adds to the disturbing atmosphere. In contrast, the Epilouge has a more melancholy tone in it, and the softer synths gives the tone of the tune a more optimistic feel. While the production is inferior to that of other Burzum projects, it still does provide some strong composition and ambient tracks.\n\nConclusion\nThis split is most likely gonna be the very last official release from Burzum, and I'd say that it ended in a good note. Uruk-Hai's side has a simple tone in its songs that gives it its own special charm, while Burzum's side is stronger in terms of technicality and has some strong ambient pieces. If you're looking to check out what Varg's music was like before Burzum or if you wanna see Varg's guitar tracks before the prison took away his guitar, then this is a split I highly recommend.\n",
        "\nI remember perfectly the first time I listened to this album, I remember it well because it was the first black metal album I listened to completely, until that moment I had only listened to single songs and I had an idea quite far away from everything black metal was about, in fact the decision to listen to this album in particular was because it had the song \"War\" as it was the only Burzum song I knew and the reference track for what I thought was going to be Burzum's sound, how wrong I was.\n\nThe first 3 seconds of the album begin with a sequence of sounds that seem like science fiction, and both at the time it was released and for someone who listens to it for the first time no matter the time, the sound of this album seems to come from another world. The sound that led Burzum is quite different from what any other band of their time could offer, there was a trend that derived from the aggressive style that was influenced by Venom or Sodom, and another much more grim trend that focused more on a chaotic and evil atmosphere with bands like Von, Abruptum or the colombians Parabellum. Varg Vikkernes on the early Burzum albums managed to give a taste of aspects of each tendence along with traces of his own style.\n\nEveryone has one of Burzum's first four albums as a favourite, but despite my personal attachment to this record, when I've listened to it again recently with a much greater background in both Burzum's music and black metal in general, I can't help but see this work as one that doesn't develop properly and at times I feel it doesn't offer the full potential it has.\n\nThe main potential is the aura that surrounds the compositions, the style is dirty and raw yet melodic, truly emotional guitar leads can be appreciated and serve as a counterpoint to the lugubrious atmosphere. Many of the best tracks are those previously written by Varg, tracks like \"Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\" or \"Spell of Destruction\" radiate strength and a mystical folk aura. It's this conjunction of layers at different levels of sound (accompanied by a heartbreaking voice) that distinguishes Burzum from other bands and gives them that unique character, except for the song \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" which is the only one in this style that doesn't convince me, It's not that it stands out from the rest of the songs but I would expect something less anticlimatic being the longest song of the album, but it seems that it is that way because it doesn't know when to put the end, it gets longer like a flame that tries not to be extinguished but it ends up getting more tiring than anything else. But if I have to mention one song as the best of the Burzum style on this album, it's not any of the songs previously written by Varg for the demos, it's \"My Journey to the Stars\" which is easily one of the best songs in the whole Burzum catalogue. Everything works perfectly and every riff is better than the previous one, some of them have such a strong melodic charge that they seem to be (or maybe they are) in a major scale, the pitch change pauses fit perfectly into the rhythm and it is also the only song on the album where Varg shows a great level on drums.\n\nBecause unfortunately, this album is far from perfection, after several years aspects that used to impress me no longer do, or learning more about the origins of the genre make me realise details that I used to see as original are not so original anymore. To start with what I have remarked before, all the songs except the mentioned \"My Journey to the Stars\" have a mediocre drum sound, as far as I have understood, Varg didn't have much experience on drums when he recorded his first 4 albums but I can really find good moments of him on that instrument, being the song \"Det som en gang var\" for me the best example of it, so I can't excuse that the drums sound so basic and weak throughout the whole play. The rest of the problems I have with what is left to comment on the album are more directed towards certain aspects that I don't feel are fully developed here, which I know they will be in Burzum's discography, or also parts that take me out of the album because of their resemblance to other musicians' work.\n\nLet's go with \"War\", it has been long discussed whether this song is a copy of the song \"Necromansy\" from Bathory's debut or \"P\u00edse\u0148 pro Satana\" from Root, my opinion is simple, I think it's a clear tribute to Bathory and I don't think it's a song that should be given the slightest importance, there are dozens of better songs with more substance in Burzum's discography, its only useful function is to serve as a first exposure to Varg's music, but even for that it's bad because it doesn't represent properly Burzum's sound, it's true that it was the song that made me get into this album but nowadays I don't like it at all, if it wasn't for its short duration I would probably skip it. And speaking of Bathory... doesn't the end of the album with \"Dungeons of Darkness\" seem a kind of \"Storm of Damnation\" much more elaborated and atmospheric? I know Varg had a lot of Bathory influence in his music but this is not the kind of ambient coming from the norwegian musician that I enjoy. In several albums after this one, Varg makes a much better use of that musical aspect and what we hear here in this song or in \"Channelling... \"seems poor in comparison, they are too short, simplistic and don't reach anything, just like \"The Crying Orc\", which I sincerely believe that it doesn't contribute to anything, there are versions on YouTube of this song in orchestral format and you can really appreciate the foundation and sonorous potential of this brief composition, but just like the other three songs mentioned, all this seems to me more like fragments of ideas that had not yet come together or have not yet found their definitive style, these four songs without being bad themselves, they detract from what could have been an album close to perfection.\n\nAs years pass by\nThe aura drops\n\n",
        "\nViewing the Burzum origins is really interesting, because it serves to bring up a recurring theme that I've seen in regards to the sound of black metal. The second wave of black metal set several paradigms about the musical values of the genre, I'm not only talking about the famous \"no fun no core no mosh no trends\" which became an intrinsic element for many in this kind of music, but a musical value that adheres to the aesthetics, specifically I'm referring to the sound quality of the recordings.\n\nThis demo together with other early examples such as Deathcrush set a precedent in what became a marked tendency for black metal, having extremely low and poor sound production parameters. Many have been the artists who have continued this trend considering themselves as the continuators and bearers of the authentic essence of black metal, while other movements within the same genre decided to abandon the lo-fi and dissonant trend to embark on other kind of sounds, I have even heard people who believe that this kind of purposely bad sound only meant a senseless devaluation of the genre that caused black metal to not evolve in a favourable way.\n\nAs with everything in life, I don't see this as a case of extremes, there are recordings that benefit from that raw, noisy style and others that benefit from a more polished and arranged production. What I can say is that many artists missed the point of Burzum's recordings, the low quality is just another element and like any other musical element you have to focus on it to make it work in your favour, and that's what Varg did on these recordings, the fact that everything sounds so dissonant reinforces the simplicity of the percussion and the melody of the guitars. Perhaps this is most effectively seen on \"Spell of Destruction\" in the changing progression of the song. In the recordings for the studio albums one can appreciate the amount of melodic moments in the music of early Burzum but this was already present from the beginning, I think it is in these parts that the influence of folk music is most noticeable where the guitar is often used mainly as a backup for the vocalist, here there is no vocalist as it is all instrumental so Varg uses the second guitar as the main thread which is accompanied by the first guitar. \n\nIt's curious to see how much of what would become Burzum is already here, unfortunately not 100% developed, \"Lost Wisdom\" doesn't have that initial aggressiveness that I still assume it to be and is only a shadow in the form of a melody of what it would become. And even if he advocated a low quality black metal sound, the albums that brought him notoriety have nowhere near as poor a quality as this one, the songs lack that vocal extremism given by the author and as much as I personally enjoy early Burzum ambient here it contributes almost nothing because it hardly sounds like anything more than a half-baked idea, there is no depth and it seems more like a series of faint repeated notes without them being particularly remarkable. Overall it's an unfinished Burzum sound but it has its charisma, maybe I'm notably influenced by the fact that I'm already familiar with the songs and so my perception of them is more positive than it should be but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate that folk melodicism as the highlight of the demo.\n\nThis is a piece of great historical and musical value that would be totally overshadowed by clearly improved versions of all the tracks, this is more for fans like me who very occasionally enjoy a noisy and instrumental Burzum.\n",
        "\nThe problem with From the Depths of Darkness is how completely unnecessary it is. There is no way - no way at all - that Varg could redo the tracks on the first four albums and make them better in context of history or their parent albums. It's kind of shot from the beginning. Not because Varg couldn't or shouldn't revisit his older material by some lofty standard of musical authenticity, but because any re-recording would be divorced from its background. Black metal is a strongly album-oriented format, so picking out tracks to re-record for what's ostensibly a \"greatest hits\" compilation doesn't work.\n\nEven if that weren't a problem, there's also the sad fact that the tracks here just don't sound good, and I mostly blame it on shoddy production (ironic, given the lo-fi qualities of the first four Burzum LPs) and the all-too-common problem with artists trying to rebottle lightning. The production is loud - extremely loud, like \"loudness wars casualty\" kind of loud. Even the ambient portions sound oppressively present - which is extremely disappointing/annoying given the original sparseness of a song like \"Channeling the Power of Minds into a New God\" was part of its charm.\n\nAfter prison, Varg's vocals changed from a banshee-esque tortured scream to a whisper vox, and the whisper vox sound out-of-place in most of these re-recorded tracks. I do not fault the artist for revisiting old songs under a new aesthetic - especially given many of these were almost two decades old upon release of this album. Indeed, it would be a pretty cool experiment in charting how Burzum has changed. However, the tracks on From the Depths of Darkness sound more like a modern band trying to straightly play the old classics rather than a modern band putting their own take on them.\n\nVarg plays the hits on From the Depths of Darkness as if he's trying to re-capture that old energy. They don't sound reinterpreted, they sound copied. The few differences are incidental when they aren't actively detracting - especially the hoarse whisper and production. There is simply no reason to listen to this when the originals are so widely available - and so widely excellent.\n\nOriginally posted to RateYourMusic. Edited for Metal Archives.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to black metal, it\u2019s almost guaranteed that one has heard about the controversies surrounding the 2nd wave before hearing any of the actual music. Varg in particular has been a standout in that regard, for a litany of crimes and beliefs that have been discussed at length already and to bring them up again would only serve as a way for me to pad this review\u2019s word count. That being said, the man\u2019s musical contributions and influence as Burzum cannot be understated. His first four albums served as my introduction to black metal, and played a crucial role in shaping my taste when it comes to the genre. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss in particular is a release that has stuck with me ever since I first listened to it 4 years ago, and has withstood the test of time.\n\nThis album, like many others coming from the Norwegian scene, diversified the archetypal black metal sound and took it into new territory. While In The Nightside Eclipse injected a symphonic bombast to the mix, and Vikingligr Veldi saw the genre head in a more progressive direction, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss laid the groundwork from what came to be known as atmoblack. From the long build-up of the opener, one can tell that this album\u2019s brand of black metal isn\u2019t so much focused on raw aggression, but atmosphere. The compositions are drawn out and rely on a handful of riffs that are used in a very sparse manner, with very simplistic drumming propping them up and driving the rhythms forward. Yet it's this instrumental scarcity that ends up being the album\u2019s greatest strength. \n\nSaid scarcity is punctuated by very minimal additions to the songs, such as lowkey synths accentuating some of the riffs, or maybe a tremolo picked lead appearing out of nowhere. They say that there\u2019s elegance in simplicity, and few albums have encapsulated the essence of that saying more than this one. Its desolate and melancholic atmosphere would be nowhere near as potent had each piece been filled with crazy drum fills, leads and bombastic synths cluttering the soundscape. Each drum beat and riff is deliberately used to instil this feeling of emptiness and being lost in nature, which is only intensified by the length of the tracks. Even the ambient instrumental \u201cTomhet\u201d (\u201cEmptiness\u201d in Norwegian, see what I did there?) is expertly paced, and despite how little there is going on during its 14 minute duration, it manages to stay engaging and is one of my favourite tracks on the album.\n\nI would be remiss not to mention the production on display, seeing as it's arguably the album\u2019s cornerstone and the main contributor to its feel. As is tradition with anything that came out of Norway in the 90s, it has a very lo-fi sound that makes the recording quite hard to digest. The guitars have a thin and sharp sound, laden with static, while the drums sound surprisingly punchy, and the bass is mostly hidden under the guitars, adding another layer of texture to the proceedings.\n\nVarg\u2019s vocal performance and lyrical themes are also of interest here, since they too proved to be one of atmoblack\u2019s defining characteristics. His high-pitched howls and screams deliver tales about nature, life and death, as well as sweeping, dreamlike vistas. They\u2019re surprisingly well written and have a very pensive tone to them, as if they\u2019re reminiscing of a time long past where man was closer to nature and lived in harmony with it.\n\nHvis Lyset Tar Oss is the masterwork of one of black metal\u2019s most controversial figures. Despite Varg being well, Varg, it still holds a very dear spot to my heart due to its role as my introduction to black metal, and it\u2019s an album I revisit to this day. While the man behind it and his actions cannot be ignored, the quality and influence of his work is immeasurable, and for that reason alone anyone interested in black metal has to give it a listen, whether through legal or illegal means.\n\nHighlights: Det Som En Gang Var, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, Tomhet\n",
        "\nIf you were to ask me what are the best black metal albums I've ever listened, I would name at least 100 albums that I would consider the best in the genre. However, if you were to ask me what is the most important black metal album I've listened to, I'd have a bit more trouble. Even with stuff I love with a passion like Dissection's \"Storm of the Light's Bane\" or anything from Darkthrone's Unholy Trinity, it's not something I would consider a game-changer for my metal journey. While the first black metal bands I listened to like Immortal and Mayhem did introduce me to the genre, I didn't really think I could get into this stuff, and that I would probably stick to death metal as my go-to in extreme metal. That is, until I listened to \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\".\n\nI'm not sure what I can say about Varg that hasn't been said already. Well he is one of the least likable musicians out there, he is one of the most talented in the genre. In fact, remember when I considered \"Filosofem\" his best work in a review I did on it last year? While, I need to clarify and say that it is the best in terms of the music itself. Not that I hate it or anything, but if Filosofem is the best in terms of musicality, then HLTO is the best in terms of influence. Not only was it HLTO that truly got me into black metal, it also has a conceptual structure and great songwriting that makes it the best Burzum album ever.\n\nIn order to understand what makes this album special, you need to check out the instruments first. The previous albums involved some unconventional-sounding instruments and raw production, but HLTO would take them in a different direction. Starting off with the first track \"Det som en gang var\", it begins with a guitar playing a slow, but powerful riff, which is followed by a haunting synth. This sets up the cold and dark atmosphere of the track, and it will be enhanced once the other instruments kick in. The drum beats range from a march-like pattern to some blastbeats, and each of these types would be a good foundation for the tempo and mood of the song. The bass may not be audible sometimes, but they do follow the guitars well and play their own riffs. The production may sound basic, but it has a high emphasis on bringing in an atmosphere to the instruments, and it works fantastically on all of the songs. \"Tomhet\" in particular is one of the strongest songs on this album in terms of atmosphere. The synths sound cheap, but not too cheap like in \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\", and the simple melodic tunes they play are enough to bring in an atmosphere of loneliness and sadness. The instrumentation on this album may not sound impressive initially, but you'll enjoy them more once you start focusing on the atmosphere.\n\nAnother thing about the album is the vocals. Varg's vocals weren't the best in his early albums, and some feel like they ruin the entire atmosphere of the album, which I can understand. However, I would argue that they enhance the album in a special way. This is especially apparent in the track \"Hvis lyset tar oss\". The tempo is more fast and chaotic, and the guitar riffs are more aggressive and furious. This works well with the vocals, where Varg shrieks in agony. In fact, Varg's vocals overall have more emotion in them than in the previous tracks, as he genuinely feels upset about something. Even in the more grander moments like in \"Det som en gang var\", his voice has an echo effect in it that gives the track a more raw and upsetting sound. Varg's vocals may sound bad on its own, but combined with the instrumentals on this track, it sounds amazing.\n\nThis album even has some of the best lyricism in Burzum's discography. Well the lyrics in previous Burzum songs range from great to okay, HLTO takes it to a whole new level. Check this verse from \"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\" for example, which quotes:\n\nBetween misty vales\nBetween gloomy mountains\nUnder gray clouds\nIn the black night\nOn a proud horse\nIn black clothes\nStrong weapons at hand\n\nThis portion of the verse uses some simple descriptions of someone running in the night, but there is something about the simplicity in the lyrics that works. It has a straightforward tone in it, and it makes a story about going in a castle sound nice. These lyrics would also be further executed with the instruments. The track goes for a more uneven and raw tone than in the previous track, and Varg's vocals sound even more unhinged. This makes the story of the castle sound more dramatic and magnificent. The lyrics are simple, but their straightforward tone gives them a humble look, and they would get more personality from the instrumentals.\n\nThis album may not sound that impressive on paper, given it has a rather basic composition, but it's the atmosphere that makes it all work. The guitar riffs are heightened by the drums, the vocals are given more emotion and flows well with the instruments, and the simple lyrics are poetic and are further enhanced by the instruments. I may like all kinds of black metal albums, but \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" still remains one of the best black metal albums ever. If you want a black metal album with a high emphasis on atmosphere, HLTO is an album I highly recommend you check out.\n",
        "\nFilosofem is quite a hard thing to approach, even for metalheads or black metal fans. It's not because of accessibilty, as the album is quite famous (\"Burzum/Dunkelheit\" was also aired on MTv as video) and easy to get; it's something entirely linked to the music. \n\nThe album is notoriously a quintessence of low-fi production and its quality is generally worse than average, yet not as bad as you'd believe at first, at least not concerning the instruments that all have a distinct space and sounding. This low-fi gives the whole thing an aura of respect, which in the end makes totally sense: this music doesn't need to be beautiful and perfect, as it has a dark, mesmerizing sound of its own, making it fully enjoyable where other issues would be roasted if they sounded the same. Together with the \"unholy trinity\" albums by Darkthrone, I see Burzum's early productions as the Norwegian black metal true statement records, what defines the genre in terms of style, ideology, execution (yeah, sorry Mayhem). This is as far away as you can go from polished, well defined and accessible music. This is something meant to be hard to grasp, elitistic.\n\nTracks are basically built of repetitive and cold guitar riffs, creating almost a trance. Yet, surprisingly, with a high sense of melody. Already present on Burzum and Hvis lyset tar oss, melody in this album is given not by music alone but also by all the small variations in main riffage, in the attention to atmospheric sounds and the pauses: all this contributes to create a melody that is not soothing and meditative, rather spell-bounding - in a dark sense of the term. \n\nThere are some really good tracks on Filosofem, like \"Burzum/Dunkelheit\" whose main riff is just as famous as \"Freezing Moon\" and just as iconic; \"Jesu d\u00f8d\", a 10 minutes long riff failing - however- to grow tiresome on the listener and filled with chilling and eerie atmosphere; \"\"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\" which is probably the best track on the album, with an excellent obsessive riff and desperate, faint screams able to evoke spine-chilling atmospheres with a haunting, bleak and obscure sense of emptiness building up around you. The low-fi sounding and the raspy guitars adds only more authenticity to this, and everything is greatly supported by the absurd vocal performance. \n\nIn fact, vocals are just awful, but nicely so, as they are one of the pillars on which the greatness of this album stands. They are deep in the background, sounding like distant, desperate otherwordly shrieks. They destroy any safe feelings that may build up by the quieter, atmospheric parts, they arrive as needles piercing your ear and mind. Willingly recorded with the worst technical support possible, they create a sort of shrieking droning that is both chilling and fascinating, as some strange sound luring you further inside the deep, dark woods. \n\nFilosofem closes with two instrumental ambient tracks, recorded while Varg was in prison and did not have access to other instruments but a keyboard. Although they are some nice ambient music pieces, they contrast too much with the rest of the album and the result is a little weird, splitting the album in two distinct and opposing parts that differ too much from eachother to form a working unity. \n\nAs said, it takes some effort to enjoy this album, you need so to say some \"meat on the bones\" regarding black metal. I would not suggest to listen to it as your introduction to the genre, or to Burzum. Like a quality spirit, it takes some taste training to fully appreciate. Personally, it took some time before I was able to listen to Burzum and pass beyond the \"what the f... did he do with the recording??\" reaction. Once I did, though, I understood the high quality of this release. You may judge Varg Vikernes in many ways, but undoubtedly he had talent for music, perhaps still has (but this is a story for another time).\n",
        "\nIt has been a while since I've written a review on this site, and I figured that the first album I review would be \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\". This album was released in 1999, where Varg was still imprisoned for his crimes. This was the second dungeon synth album he released, with the first being \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\". I already did a review of the latter, and it wasn't that good to say the least. However, in that review, I also stated that Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf was the better ambient album. From the higher quality synths to the superior atmosphere, this album is pretty much what Dau\u00f0i Baldrs should've been.\n\nOne major improvement in Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf is its synths. With Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, the synths were midis in poor quality, and didn't sound good at all. With this album, Varg got a better keyboard, and the synths sound cleaner and less amateurish. The piano has a more clean sound, and the chants sound more realistic and smooth. One great example of this would be the first track \"Tuistos Herz\". The instruments in this song are very good, with more reverb in the main instrument, and the flute having a smoother sound. The instruments in this track in particular also have a better execution in the mysterious sound it's going for, and the piano further accomplishes this in the smooth, yet shortened sound.\n\nThis brings me into the next point: the atmosphere. In Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, it was trying to go for a medieval atmosphere, but it isn't executed well with the poor quality of the instruments. Here, the high quality of the instruments are better in bringing in the mysterious and cold atmosphere. A good example of this is in \"Einf\u00fchlungsverm\u00f6gen\". The drums in the track beat slow, and the other instruments are low-pitched and droning slowly. They bring in an agonizing experience in feeling helpless. That idea is further pointed out in the description of the track, where Tiw is changed forever by seeing the eyes of fire.\n\nHowever, this album isn't perfect by any means. Some of the instruments on this albums can get a bit annoying at times. For example, in \"Ansuzgardaraiw\u00f4\", the track starts off pretty decent with the slow, creepy instruments. But then twice in the song, we hear these loud clashing sounds that drag on in an repetitive pattern. Those parts ended up killing whatever mood the song was going for. Another thing about the songs is that their descriptions doesn't always match whatever the atmosphere of the song is doing. In \"Frij\u00f4s einsames Trauern\", the description says that it is about a mother mourning the lost of her son. However, the overall mood of the album is a bit lighthearted, even playful at times. However, the descriptions still generally match up the songs for the most part, and the worst-sounding synths on this album are still a lot better than the \"best\" synths in Dau\u00f0i Baldrs.\n\nOverall, I had a much better listening experience with Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf than in the previous album. Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf shows that Varg can do good dungeon synth albums, and with the more professional-sounding synths and better execution in atmosphere, it's a big improvement. Even if dungeon synth isn't your cup of tea, I still recommend you give this album a listen.\n",
        "\nWhat's so particular about this album is Burzum manage to capture the essence of black metal while remaining an outlier of the genre simultaneously. There are no blast beats, none of the more substantial thrashy parts black metal generally uses. The fast strumming on the guitars is there though but only briefly. The very sparse vocals, although shrieks, if anything sound closer to what would be found on an extreme industrial metal record as they're basically just Varg screaming into the mic with added distortion during post-processing. They're not the usual black metal high-pitched screams that one would hear on any standard album in the genre. And despite those technical and stylistic differences, the album undeniably feels very much like black metal at its core.\n\nThere are many possible points of criticism: the album is over an hour long, in spite of being just 6 tracks, and those tracks don't even make a remote effort to be dynamic or evolving, they're one utterly simple musical idea that one might say drags on, or less critically, that pulls the listener into its emptiness and makes sure they feel the void fully. There's a sort of hypnotic trance about the repetition of one same part on a loop a few dozen times that sets in. The tracks are, really, moods rather than any form of actual song. In concept they couldn't be compared to mainstream music, or even to what most metal bands do. As an analogy: most albums could be compared to a film; with a beginning, a development, an end, and a clear point; while this would rather just be an arbitrary collection of scenes, themselves vague and with no particular meaning.\n\nWhat's interesting is it's subtle with how it doesn't come across as overly dramatic. One might imagine this record might be Varg's youthful and passionate artistic utterances that will sound far too edgy to be taken seriously at all. But it isn't that. The music instead feels very discreet, and the melodies are quietly subversive rather than extreme in nature. As a matter of fact, it's quite alarming and striking in a sense the music is so cold; black metal always is but it also has a lot of drive and vitality to it. This seems to carry its maker's resignation from life as no trace of actual emotion seems to be there. It isn't even interested in sounding particularly dark. It's mysterious, at best, as far as any discernible intent and it isn't clear whether even that is intentional or not. For instance an early Godflesh sounds cold and bleak, but there's a deliberate nihilism in the music; an aggressive search for that extreme blackness. There's definitely a warm passion and suffering there. Here, the notion of musical nihilism would seem too voluntary, and the emptiness in the music seems a lot more natural or accidental. \n\nReally, this doesn't sound close to anything and yet at the same time it isn't just a lethargic piece of drone soundscapes. The most definable components in that atmosphere would be a little bit of epic, sorrow, darkness, and scorn, but really only a hint of those and the album couldn't possibly be defined by any of those separately, as it isn't much of any one particular thing. It couldn't be said it's lifeless, however it is too withdrawn from the world to have any concrete connection to it or to be tainted by one vivid dominant color, and it surely wouldn't come as a surprise; to anyone I'm sure; if it turned out it was written by an alien.\n\nThe production is, of course, deliberately excruciating. The guitars sound like Varg plugged whatever cheap electric guitar he had at the time straight into an amp and recorded it. As in, just the amp's raw signal, with no cab. They're just hi-gain distortion violence captured and lightly processed (if at all) into a basic analog device and then just thrown in to set the foundation for a few of the tracks. About half of the album, while the rest focuses purely on the bare ambiance aspect, with no guitars. The drums sound distant and avoid any semblance of complexity. The bass can be heard occasionally on the quieter moments but mostly the album was intentionally made to sound trebbly and piercing, just to be anti-musical and abandon any notion of comfort for the listener. When the keys come on, they sound exactly like what one might imagine when thinking of \"indifference depicted musically\". They just float around, with as little personality or warmth as could possibly be given to keys as they communicate the apathy of Varg. \n\nAll that being said, the essential question is: is the music actually good ? It is. Despite the withdrawn nature of the music, it's actually interesting and solidly written, with a real inspiration behind each track. These tracks might be one section on repeat for 8min, but that section was carefully crafted each time and succeeds in establishing a unique atmosphere. \n\nUltimately this might be beyond labels, and could be described simply as the work of a talented sociopath. It's unemotional, apathetic and demonstrates its detached demeanor from the exterior world. There isn't the slightest trace of a mere attempt even at being attractive to anyone and it is one of the most raw albums in the metal universe to date. Finally, there's a famous quote from some writer that goes: \"Apathy is the glove in which evil slips its hand\". It seems to fit this.\n",
        "\nBurzum is a special project for me. Its music was one of the reasons why I started to listen to extreme metal. I always found the sound of Burzum dark and enigmatic, but engrossing. Knowing that something like this was made by just ONE musician was even more astonishing for me. The atmosphere that Burzum's music transmits is pretty captivating and for me, this is one of those albums that has to be taken as a reference when playing black metal.\n\nTo start, I want to talk about the songs. Surprisingly, Burzum has a great deal of variety as to the songs. There is no reason why you think the album is repetitive. It goes from the accelerated rhythms of \"Feeble Screams from Forest Unknown\" and \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" to the more mid-paced songs like \"Spell of Destruction\". Equally, each one of the songs has something different to offer. The riffs are very varied; they are both raw and melodic in the precise moment. Even the instrumental pieces are great songs and immerse the listener to a grim environment.\n\nWhat I want to highlight from Burzum is the achieved sound with very few resources. Despite the riffs are not very complex and the music is not as fast or as \"aggressive\" in comparison to some other black metal bands from back in those days, Burzum's music reached to be raw, visceral and a real ode to darkness. This is in part thanks to the production since as the album does not have a very sophisticated audio quality, this aspect was exactly what helped the music to have such a dark sound. The instruments execution is pretty decent and as I mentioned, Varg Vikernes is not precisely the most virtuous multi-instrumentist of all, but his work functions and he is very competent as an executor.\n\nThe voice is another great characteristic from this album. That shriek and agonic singing style can make any non-black metal listener feel uncomfortable or scared by such an impressive vocal sound, which, for me, makes it even better, as you know that this is a very dark and evil music style. It's impressive and makes Vark Vikernes a peculiar, but \"iconic\" singer (in his way).\n\nTo finish, the last thing I want to praise is the atmosphere. \"Burzum\" is a very dark record, everything thanks to the aspects previously mentioned. The music is capable to immerse the listener into a dismal and funeral atmosphere, and I think this is what makes good a black metal band (or project, in this case): the environment and sonorous style.\n\nThere's no much more that I can say about \"Burzum\". This is not my personal favourite Burzum album, but it's undoubtedly a masterpiece of dark music and for me, black metal at its purest style. Listen to \"Burzum\" if you want to know what black metal is about: pure darkness and murk.\n",
        "\nThrash and power metal are the genres I enjoy the most, but they are not everything that I listen to. I actually got into metal because of more extreme stuff such as Cannibal Corpse or Mayhem (more \"violence-oriented\" bands), but the day I discovered Burzum meant a new paragraph in my life. It was the day when I discovered a new way of making metal, following a more atmospheric and melodic tendency.\n\nI discovered Burzum with the song \"Det Som En Gang Var\". I was really impressed by how different this song was compared to other black metal bands; its harsh sound, minimalist execution, repetitiveness, the additions of keyboards and Varg's peculiar voice shaped a very unique style that captivated me since the first listening. I continued listening to more separated Burzum songs, but the very first complete album that I listened to was Belus, and from there, no other album has gripped me as this one.\n\nMost of the characteristics described above suits to most of the Burzum albums, and this is the same case with Belus, but I'll be talking about these features more deeply throughout this review.\n\n\"Belus\" has a very unique style. It's an atmospheric sound shaped by the subtle execution of the instruments. It's already widely known that Varg Vikernes has never been a prodigious instrumentist, as he is very basic in several aspects, but albums like this one proof that it's not necessary being a very technical musician to make amazing music. Belus's music is mostly composed by tremolo-based riffs, arpeggios, repetitive notes through several sections and power chords, and the result is simply beautiful, as Varg makes a musical collage of these resources to compose a very melodic black metal style with various arrangements that give a more epic and magic sensation, rather than being dark and raw, as Burzum's first releases. The music is very repetitive, but the intention is that. This is not a chaotic or savage black metal (for that, you can easily listen to Mayhem). Burzum goes towards a more epic direction, what I find gripping and simply beautiful. This is an album to listen to in total peace. It's throbbing, but relaxing at the same time.\n\nVarg Vikernes shows a very different type of voice than in his first releases. Something similar to what we already had heard on Filosofem (but with a better recording quality). His strident and agonizing voice was changed by a more mature and restrained vocalization, which showed (nay, consolidated) Burzum new style. But another positive aspect is the inclusion of clean voices, exchanging them throughout all the album to give different hues to the music.\n\nThe mix and production also play an important role in Belus. There are times when some instruments stand out more than other (for example, the bass guitar in \"Glemselens Elv\"), or when the guitar sound is lowered. This aspect (along with the change of voices) plays with the sensations of the listener and also help create a different atmosphere in each section. Thus, though repetitive, the album counts with enough variety of elements to captivate the listener.\n\nEach song is captivating in its manner.\n\nThis album is very special to me. It's special because \"Belus\" gave me another perspective of metal. It showed me that not everything has to do with aggressiveness, speed or a prodigious execution. Playing with the production, with the sound, and using little musical resources is also valid. Also, it showed me the most melodic side of metal, which later would allow me to enter the power metal world. This album is so hypnotic, enveloping and gripping that after 10 years of having been released, it stills captivates me. Every Burzum fan has his own preference and criteria to say which album is the best of this project, but as far as I'm concerned, and owing to the reasons I have exposed, \"Belus\" is my favourite album of all, and it will probably stay like this for a very long time.\n\nFor people who listen to atmospheric black metal, recommending this album will be nothing new, but for people who are not used to this particular subgenre, I recommend you to check it. Maybe you can find something interesting for your ears. It's a shame Burzum is currently retired of making music. However, we always can enjoy his legacy by listening to oeuvres like this one.\n\nLong live Burzum!\n",
        "\nIt's the year 1997. Varg Vikernes is doing his time for all the crimes he committed, including the murder of Euronymous. However, Varg still had a desire to release more music. The problem is, the prison he was staying in only allowed him to have a synthesizer. In Varg's case, however, it isn't really a problem, because he has done ambient music before. Plus, by releasing atmospheric albums, he can expand his fanbase by introducing them to dungeon synth. And it all started here with the album \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\".\n\nNow I don't have a problem with ambient black metal/dungeon synth. In fact, if it's done well, it can sound fantastic. Burzum has created good ambient music before with the song \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\" from the \"Filosofem\" album. While the song is lengthy, the high quality synths and the space-like atmosphere works excellent for background music. In this album, however, it all sounds like a watered-down version of previous ambient songs. Later on, Varg would release \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\", and the overall quality of that album is far superior. I would argue that \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" is more of a trial and error album, while \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\" is the more finished version.\n\nNow let's talk about the synths. The synths themselves are in an amateur quality. Now I understand that the prison didn't allow Varg to have the most prestigious musical equipment, but even then, he could've gotten a better synth. They sound like they come from a lost Nintendo 64 game, so there are cheap sounds of trumpets, generic sounds of echos, and even a hideous-sounding drum that has a lack of reverb and loudness. I didn't think I would find a Burzum album that has horrible production besides the early demos, but this one takes the cake in the worst instruments in Burzum's discography.\n\nEven without the amateur instruments, the albums still reeks of obsessive repetition. While \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\" does include its fair share of repetition, the high quality production makes up for it. Here, the horrible instruments don't do it any favors. The cheap sounds only make the repetition worse. One of the worst cases of this in the album is \"Illa ti\u00f0andi\". Most of the song is just a simple piano tune followed by generic echos. What makes this even more annoying is the fact that it goes on for 10 minutes. The poor production ends up making the song feel a lot longer than 10 minutes. Had it been cut down to say 5 minutes, it would've been more tolerable.\n\nHowever, it's not all bad in this album. \"Hermo\u00f0r \u00e1 Helfer\u00f0\" is one of the only good songs off the album. While it does feature repetition, it isn't that bad since the song is only 2 minutes and 40 seconds long. Also, the quality of the synths is slightly better, though they still have that cheap sound, and they give off a sweet sound that can relax the listener. Another decent song is \"\u00cd heimr Heljar\". It still has the generic-sounding drums, but this one is also short at 2 minutes. Plus, it does execute the epic sounds better than most of the other songs.\n\nI can see the direction Varg was going for in this album, as he wanted to create a dungeon synth album that have medieval influences. However, that idea is executed poorly with the cheap production and excessive repetition. While there were some okay songs on the album, it's not something I'd want to listen to on a daily basis.\n",
        "\nBurzum's demos are interesting, both in good and bad ways. The first demo \"Burzum I\" was barely audible. Even for black metal standards, I could barely decipher the music, and Varg's overall performance was lousy. His next demo, titled \"Burzum II\", would be a massive improvement, though it still has its flaws.\n\nThe first notable change in this demo is the distortion. The demo still retains its distorted sound, though the music is now more clearer. The guitars are more audible, and the drums and bass aren't as quiet as the previous demo. However, we still get some occasional horrible distortion on this demo. In \"Spell of Destruction\", the drums overpower the rest of the instruments. If I listen closely, I could just barely hear the guitar, though the bass was nowhere to be heard. I'm fine with Burzum using distortion, as in their later works, Varg uses distortion to add the signature raw feeling in his songs. Here, however, he still has yet to perfect the distortion.\n\nVarg's instrument work has also improved a lot. In the previous demo, the guitars just have an okay riff, and the drums just bang all over the place. Here, the guitars have more complex sound to them and have more of a rough style. The drums have more control as they bang in a better pattern. The bass, however, still needs some improvement, as it just copies everything the guitar is doing, and doesn't offer anything special.\n\nThe composition on the songs have improved majorly. In the previous demo, it's obvious that Varg had no direction on how the songs would be written, so he just went along with whatever guitar riff was playing. Here, there is more purpose in the sound. The guitars and drums have a focused structure, and they don't go off-track. Even the mediocre bass at least doesn't sound off key. It isn't perfect, but at least they're structured better.\n\nThe overall musical quality in this demo is far better than the previous demo. There is less distortion in the songs, the composition is structured better, and Varg's musical ability on the instruments are miles better. While the demo isn't perfect by any means, it's at least a tolerable listen.\n",
        "\nBurzum. If there ever was a band condensing the aesthetics, the history, the values and the art of an entire musical subgenre, black metal in this case, that is surely Count Grishnackh's one-man band. Varg Vikernes's creature is known not only due to the controversial personality of its sole member and mastermind, not to mention the dramatic events that sprinkled his life, but also because he was among the very first few who gave birth to the black metal scene, especially at a musical level, creating some of the finest examples of the genre and then immediately evolving, throwing in ambient and minimalistic influences that resulted in some of the darkest, most atmospheric and unique black metal releases ever recorded.\n\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is, along with its successor \"Filosofem\", the peak of Varg Vikernes's production, an album that perfectly blends the early sound of Burzum with the dark ambient influences furtherly developed with the following release. The tracklist is made of only four tracks, whose duration is significant, with the album clicking in at 44:28 minutes. The music contained in \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" can be described as raw, emotional, dark, minimalistic and atmospheric; the guitar riffs are simple, yet extremely memorable and evil; the drumming is not exaggerately technical, but it's well executed and it perfectly fits the atmosphere, shifting from agitated session, pervaded by the use of mid-paced blast beats and thrashy rhytms, to calmer and more atmospheric ones, where the pace slows down, often highlighted by the use of the double bass.\n\nThe bass mainly follows the guitars, and it's quite audible to be honest, while the vocal department sees Varg exhibiting the trademark excruciating, visceral scream typical of the early Burzum releases. The songs are long and repetitive, but without resulting monotonous or boring: the listener finds himself absorbed by the album's music, thanks to the excellent songwriting and the brilliant structure of the songs, resulting in an amazing experience that only Burzum is able to provide. The keyboards prove crucial in these terms, providing a dense, freezing and suggestive atmosphere, capable of evoking gloomy visions of ancient forests, ancestral landscapes and dreamy castles in the mind of the blessed listener. Experiencing this album while walking in a forest is one of the most extraordinary musical experiences I've ever had.\n\nThe final, decisive element to the triumph that is \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is its production. Black metal's lo-fi standards are something that is often joked on, but here we have one of the finest examples of how a raw, unrefined production can make a difference between an excellent album and a masterpiece: Burzum is able to make the best of it, exponentially enhancing the strong and dense atmosphere permeating the whole record, which simply wouldn't be the same otherwise. Honestly there's no need to plunge into the description of each of the four tracks on the album, because, as I said, \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is a real transcendental musical experience, which has to be explored in its entirety, in order not to lose the meaning, the magic and the cohesion behind it. This opus is an essential milestone, one that will forever keep its place in the Olympus of the best black metal albums ever recorded. Absolutely essential!\n",
        "\nWhile Varg might not be the best person personality-wise, as a musician, he's certainly got some talent. His debut self-titled album was already a great listen, but after some mediocre releases and another fantastic release with \"Hvis lyset tar oss\", Varg puts out his best album yet with Filosofem.\n\nBlack Metal is known for it's poor quality, but Varg uses that as an advantage. The album's opening track, \"Dunkelheit\", is distorted to a point where you can barely hear the guitar, bass, and drums, but that's part of the lo-fi aesthetic Varg was going for. By adding the distortion, it feels more raw and unfiltered. His vocals are also distorted, not helped by the fact that he not only shrieks, but also used the worst microphone he could find to record them, which was an old helicopter headset. Some may be bothered by the vocals, but I find them fitting to the aesthetic since it adds even more noise in this already chaotic album.\n\n\"Jesu d\u00f8d\" is more of an underrated song off the album. The lyrics are entirely in Norwegian, but when translated, you find that it's a beautiful poem about a dead body withering away. Speaking of which, Varg's songwriting in general throughout the album is improved greatly from his previous works. Another great example of this is \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\". The song talks about what life will be while in wintry pain, and what death will be like. The lyrics's poetic descriptions are kinda a contrary to the unfiltered, aggressive sound of the instruments and vocals, forming some sort of metaphor between good and evil.\n\nVarg is known for his ambient songs, but his best ambient black metal song is from this album, titled \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\", which translates to \"Touring Transcendental Self Support\". The synths of the song gives it a space-like vibe, and while it's only 25 minutes long, the execution of the song is done well to a point where it feels like it lasts longer. It works as a far cry from the extreme sound from the rest of the album, and is a nice break from all the noise.\n\nOverall, Varg had created an amazing album that ranges from the heavy distortions of \"Dunkelheit\" to the low-tone ambient of \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\". It's easily one of the best black metal albums to be released in the early 90s and a must listen to those getting into the black metal genre.\n",
        "\nSo with very little pomp and even less ceremony Burzum have landed another album in the year of our demise 2020. Compositionally, this is the least unified and longform we have seen this artist. \u2018Thulean Mysteries\u2019 is really a compilation of the dust that has been gathering on the Burzum name since the release of \u2018The Ways of Yore\u2019 back in 2014, with no contecting logic or coherence to speak of from start to finish. For passionate Burzum fans whose sanity depends on keeping things all in the same place, this release comes as more of a relief than anything else. It\u2019s tiring work updating playlists with the sporadic tracks and singles that have been accumulating over the years, especially given how half formed they are. But now, listening to them all in one monolithic double album, I\u2019m struck by a deeper thought.\n\nThe music here is a continuation of the post-prison ambient albums. The same patches are used, the same simple ambient chord progressions divided up with simple folk pieces. Even compared to the prison albums this is intentionally sparse, barren music with very little to latch onto intellectually, paving the way for a penetration at a deeper subconscious level. At least that was true of \u2018Thulean Mysteries\u2019 two predecessors. Here, the same basic ideas are applied, but with even less structure or logic. The tracks cut off, sometimes mid note. A chanting vocal piece will be bookended by two synth passages too short to even be credited asOH MY GOD IS THAT A SAXAPHONE TONE USED ON \u2018THE RUINS OF DAWRFMOUNT\u2019???!\n\nSo what\u2019s the deeper thought lurking in the back of my mind after a few listens? Taken on it\u2019s own, this is a compilation of b-sides, demos, and unreleased material for the Burzum completist only. But, if we analyse this in the context of Burzum\u2019s post-prison career it fits with a broader trend of entropy that perfectly mirrors the pre-prison albums. \u2018Belus\u2019 is highly structured, with clear phases and turning points which allow one to navigate the album. \u2018Fallen\u2019 was a clumsier attempt at the same. \u2018Umskiptar\u2019 was even less focused, to the point where structurally it was a mess redeemed only by some neat ideas scattered here and there. Then when the metal was packed up, \u2018S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan\u2019 was a focused yet minimal return to ambient. \u2018The Ways of Yore\u2019 followed in the same vein but with less focus; and then we have this, \u2018Thulean Mysteries\u2019, an even less focused work that nevertheless manages to captivate the most dedicated among Varg\u2019s followers at least (who despite appearances do not shy away from criticising the guy).\n\nPre-prison, if we take \u2018Det Som Engang Var\u2019 through to \u2018Filosofem\u2019 we notice a similar pattern of entropy (the self-titled debut gets a pass for being the debut). From the highly disciplined structures of the former we depart with the endless wanderings of the latter via the otherworldly but still focused \u2018Hviss Lyset Tar Oss\u2019.\n\nAnalysing Burzum albums in clusters like this reveals a bizarre logic of decay that mirrors the patterns of life and death, both individually and societally. \u2018Thulean Mysteries\u2019 feels like an ending, but in its unfocused and it\u2019s at times downright clumsy execution we begin to see the logic of half formed ideas, either decaying from the old or growing anew out of this compost. Now I\u2019ve seen Varg\u2019s youtube channel. I\u2019m not about to fold his senile ramblings into a reinterpretation of Burzum\u2019s entire career as a holsitic and long form commentary on the passage of time and the process of death and decay. The simpler explanation is that Varg has been amassing these tracks slowly over the last seven years or so and decided to put them all on one release. And whilst post-prison Burzum (now the most prolific era if you count \u2018From the Depths of Darkness\u2019) has been patchy at best, there is an ever present kernel of truth and beauty to Varg\u2019s approach to compositions, whether they be extended, patient works of gradually unfolding majesty, or half formed shreds of grander concepts as they are here. An unfocused and belated question mark of an album such as this seems a fitting way to end one of the most notorious careers in metal (both in and outside of the music), and yet if this proves to be another new beginning for Burzum I cannot help but be intrigued as to what the guy will do next.\n\nOriginally published at Hate Meditations\n",
        "\nEveryone should know by now, that Uncle Varg (I use that term loosely) has developed a wonderful act for creating \"ambient\" themes in his music. No, Mr. Varg-Man isn't perfect. He's not me after all. Pfft, that was a joke, in case you happen to be seriously stupid. Burzum's sound has changed a lot. And if you ask me, Varg has contributed a lot to ambient music in the metal scene, just in general. Plus, Burzum's only member, Varg, happens to sing on-and-off a few times during this entire release. Now, I would like to point-out that, well, I doubt he has had any professional singing lessions. And well, I guess it doesn't really matter to bring that up, he's actually not that bad. However, he doesn't sound that fantastic either. But then again, these are my opinions and should not be taken seriously. This isn't terrible, honestly... But I suppose I could (realistically) see why people don't like it. Especially long-time fans of Burzum, because they're dumb. That's why. Just kidding... No, but I think what a lot of fans are probably angry about is, well, this isn't really a traditional, black metal album (in case you didn't find this out yet). And well, just sayin', fans of Burzum should honestly know this by now. I mean, it's not \"new\" news... But is this record really worth the sixty-minutes? As Varg-Boy (that was a reference from \"The Waltons\") would say, \"let's find out\"!\n\nSo...basically, this has pretty clear production with \"polished\" clarity. The end... Nope! There's more! Varg constently uses a very...\"limited\" amount of \"synths\" in this album. I think Varg had a vision of how he wanted this to sound, with a few different tones, and that's all. I guess he prefers having restrictions to create ambinet music, just like he did when he was in prison. Poor fella. Each song contains very slow-paced melodies. Probably underneath 100BPM. But, at least with Varg's own limitations, at least he found verity in his construction with using very \"selective\" instruments as his main concept. However, I do want to take this time to say something that sounds really stupid to me, the track, entitled \"The Reckoning of Man\". Varg's got like, an \"infinity\" for saying \"I remember, I remember, I remember...\". Like, it sounds (attractively) dumb. Can't help but mock some of his lyricism, a little. It sounds like his lead instrument is \"xylophone\" and/or \"glockenspiel\". With deepened, bass-themed synths for \"thickness\". \n\nAs I kind of hinted earlier, Varg's singing isn't too abhorrent...but it's far from grace, too... It sounds a bit \"silly\". But please, whatever you do, don't tell him that! Or else, I might just end up with more holes than swiss cheese, if you catch my drift...? I would hate for my fractured skull to be whistling like a boiling tea pot from (blank) wounds. Anyways... Chances are, since I can't comprehend everything Varg is singing (or even chanting), he's probably using \"Norwegian\" in some of this album. And yes, I wasn't even making a joke about that. I can only (yet honestly) assume that. Varg uses his \"deeper\" voices for the chanting. And he uses his neutral (natural) vocals for the English lyricism, it seems. Some of the vocal stems in the tracks, are a bit...\"muffled\", not to mention \"distorted\". I wonder if that was Varg's intention? Kind of sounds \"atmospheric\", they're there, but sound (purposely) hidden. I wouldn't be surprised. This record reminds of the modern-day \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\" (1999) album, but with more added features. Some songs contain a lot of reverb for the vocals, giving them a much winder range and depth. But remember, each song provides slightly different production (clarity, not construction) than the others for this record. Which, again, I think was done on purpose. There is no...\"one-way\" concept about the release's overall production (if that makes sense to you), but they're (very) close. Imagine a bunch of \"singles\" thrown into one compliation record, and then there you have it. And another thing worthy enough of mentioning is, some songs do use almost the same build-layout, so if you feel like you've just heard this one song, chances are, you (kind of) did (but on another track). \n\nI'll admit, for me, writing this review, for a strange album like this, has been a little tough... It's very atmospheric, strange, slow, mysteries. I wouldn't say that it sounds \"predictable\". However, this would be good music to have playing at a funeral. Not mine of course, but yours. These songs would be good for RPG games, if all the songs on this album were apart of the game's original soundtrack of course. I wonder what software Varg is using for these synths/instrumentals? They don't sound like garbage at least. I'm also glad Burzum's been experimental with all-sorts of musical-related themes, it shows that one band has much potential. Even if the band happens to only have one member. Not all songs have vocals, thankfully. I think that would have killed me if Varg failed to do so himself. \n\nWell, Varg, I suppose these are \"The Ways of Your Creation\" (see what I did there?!). You've brought an entirely new idea to the table and went with it. Just sad that this isn't your strongest piece. And is, honestly, a bit forgettable. If not for websites archiving even shitty music and shitty bands, nobody would even care to remember this album. I'm not saying this is shit, I like it, but it's...watered-down some. It doesn't having an \"exciting\" sound. Just an \"unusual\" one. And I feel that it's lacking a bit of \"brightness\". It's too....gloomy for its own good. \n\nWell, I'll try wrapping this review up. It's slightly beneath average to me. A few extra construction methods would have been nice, but this is what you can expect from Varg the Goblin Slayer. At least I'm willing to purchase this from a CD store and throw my money towards it, I'd listen to it more than once. It's got some \"value\" in it. I'd even go to great lengths and buy it eBay, if I really wanted to. But currently, I don't really want to. Perhaps sometime though. As usual, I have to always use YouTube to listen to some of these bands because times are getting harder and some bands never have a reissue of their material, or even create their stuff on CD-formats to begin with. Or, some CDs are so rare, people want outragous prices for the music. At least with this album, it shouldn't be worth too much...for obvious reasons... Never thought Id' get around to reviewing this release. I'd recommend it to \"some\" people... The end...\n",
        "\nBurzum. Varg Vikernes. Black metal. Concepts alone, or ideas, if it were as such, are things that, until recently, I've struggled to actually grasp. Given, I have heard - and keep hearing an absolute ton of information and recommendations from and around this genre, and this band in particular. Be that, from the infamous actions from Varg Vikernes - that I do not wish to rehash, as I assume other reviewers must have by now - or other related incidents. Bands or the like, it has felt to be a constant stream of learning, as I begin to actively look for and pursue a sound worth listening to in the genre. None, so far, however, I feel have paled in comparison to this record. 'Filosofem' is what I would like to assume is the single anomaly in the crowd - a bygone bystander in this cold tundra, but standing proudly in the center as a statue that almost everyone seems to enjoy. Although, as an outsider to its ideas and appeals, it felt overbearingly foreign to me. That said, however, I persisted... and I can quantify, that, without any thought or remorse, this album has helped me crack open and understand black metal as a genre.\n\nTheatrics aside for a moment, one of the largest aspects of what I have found to be a wall getting into this genre is the pure, raw sound barrier. It's no secret to anyone - it's almost a preference, really - that the ways that records are typically recorded are not only of a raw variety, but purely unprocessed. Unburdened by extra noise, to say. It's a sound in a pure, imperfect form. Unsurprisingly so, this is far from deviation in a lot of areas - the only true difference I can particularly say is that Varg fucking delivers harder than anything. Instrumentation is almost exactly what I can say I would want in a record of its like - it's hard and brutal for a decent chunk of its time. I can almost feel each and every slam of the drums, and the droning of the guitar as this record persists, and it's... good, it's amazing. Everything about it breathes itself intentional, and I could not call it any less. It's astounding to hear the work put into it, on tracks like \"Jesu d\u00f8d\" and \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\". Each and every scream is gutteral, and piercing. It's... honestly something I didn't expect, in a lot of areas.\n\nMore onto that, however, I far less expected to find that there's this grand antithesis to the record, come to its second half. Whereas the expected sound and atmosphere is supposed to breed of bleakness, it shifts itself off into a purely atmospheric sound, while that sense of overbearing bleakness and dread simply does not leave it. It is almost as if listening to a documentary about missing children, if I must put it bluntly. It's just... there aren't a lot of words for me to describe my surprised awe to that - because, as it was, my perception of the genre had always been that it was this peculiar world of bleak lyrics and raw sound. It's beyond surprising, more than it is... creating itself an aura of anomalous standing. Stranger than anything, really. It makes me wish I had more I could say for it. But, for once in my time on The Metal Archives... it leaves me stumped. Be it creativity or pure enjoyment, either way, I still listen. Although, I suppose that is the beauty in most music - if you're left to your expectations, and they are met, then there is no point.\n\nIf I'm being entirely honest, it feels rather ironic to be writing this at all. A lot of my tastes in music - rather, my reviewing patterns themselves - infer that an album like this is far out of left field. My curiosities are golden and swift, it would seem, because - at the end of the day, the composition of this record, in a general manner, works in quite a way that, likely, quite a lot of music these days just won't meet. There is no denying that, in my mind, 'Filosofem' is a must-have for any metal fan. I can't even say that words like \"iconic\" or \"classic\" really, truly, describe this record. For something to monumentally answer and give me solace in my understanding of a genre I could not dig my heels into before it feels to be not only important, but... there simply is no experience to be had that is quite like it. My only true wish is that I had more words left to describe how it makes me feel. It's easily the single best break-in record for black metal that I, personally, have ever heard. What's the pain in that?\n",
        "\nI'd like to start this review of the single called ''Mythic Dawn'' with a little quote from Kristian Vikernes himself: ''If it's not a full-length album it's not worth releasing...''. He should have stayed true to his word, as this single seems pointless. \n\n''Mythic Dawn'' isn't a terrible song, it is a okay, in all honesty. Nevertheless it isn't good enough to be its own release. To me, the song is a bit like ''Channeling The Powers Of Souls Into A New God'' from the debut. Though it's ok, it's not really anything special. \n\nThe song itself is simply an attempt at a more ambient and atmospheric song. It could work well as an intro or something, because listening to it does build up some expectations; when the song is over, you kinda expect an album to start, you feel ready for the actual music to start, but instead, it just stops, that was it! It's as if 'Silvester Anfang' from 'Deathcrush' by Mayhem or 'Prelude' from Nordland I by Bathory or 'Frost' from 'Frost' by Enslaved had been released as singles, it just wouldn't work, because they're introductions, they get you ready for what's to come, even though they're all enjoyable, they're not any focal points of the music, more just a mood-setter. \n\nThere are 2 different melodies played over and over again, the first one is really dull, the second one is somewhat nice, actually. There are distorted guitars, but not in any 'heavy' way; I hate to use this word, but I'm not sure how else to describe it so: they sound trippy. They have this strange echoing, which kinda works. The melodies are both pretty simple and straightforwards. If the song had been cut in half, it could have made for a pretty good intro, but nothing more than that, to be honest. \n\nSource for quote: http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/2005_interview_metalcrypt.shtml\n",
        "\nThe man known as Varg Vikernes was very busy during 1992. Apart from beginning to burn down churches in that concoction of bravado and violence that epitomized the Black Circle, Varg recorded albums \u2013 lots of them. Within the year, he had laid to tape the first three Burzum full-lengths, as well as the EP Aske, then very narrowly missed including Filosofem in that memorable 12 months. While most fans and commentators consider 1992 an incredible year of progress for Burzum and for the roots of the Norwegian black metal style more generally, commenting on the way in which each release moved towards a new sound, few have voiced the opinion that such speed belies a man in a great hurry. As case in point, consider the release of Aske as much a flung-together promotion for arson as a planned musical statement. However, while that brief release adjacent to this album hangs together moderately well as an entity, Det Som Engang Var remains a mess of creativity. In short, the second Burzum full-length feels extremely rushed.\n\nThat rushed feeling flies in the face of its release process, which followed more than a year on from the initial recording, Varg releasing it on his own (extremely short-lived) Cymophane Records after facing major issues getting it put out on Euronymous\u2019s imprint Deathlike Silence Productions. In an early career not short on irony, Det Som Engang Var (Norwegian for \u201cwhat once was\u201d, a song title that would notably be reused on the following album) eventually saw the light just after the former musician had killed the latter. Just as with Aske, Varg changed the title of this release from the planned \u201cP\u00e5 Svarte Troner\u201d (\u201con black thrones\u201d), which is practically the same name as the outro track, an instrumental of menacing distorted voices, feedback, and irregular sound effects called \u2018Svarte Troner\u2019. Although neither title seems especially apt for the Lord of the Rings themes prevalent on Det Som Engang Var, a revealing interview (not at the time of release) showed Varg trying to link these to his later ideas of Odinism. It seems interesting to view \u2018En Ring til aa Herske\u2019 (\u2018One Ring to Rule\u2019) as \u201cabout Germanic people and Draupnir, the ring of Odin\u201d, though we should take it with a pinch of salt, since Varg also insists that Aske (Ashes) was a description of \u201cOdin\u2019s [faith] today and God\u2019s tomorrow\u201d. Considering that the cover art of Det Som Engang Var is taken from Dungeons & Dragons, my take is just that Varg was really into fantasy.\n\nTherefore, the potential for considering this album thoughtful and carefully formed certainly exists, but I\u2019d wager that\u2019s mostly people applying better logic after the fact. Varg was immensely creative at this point in time, beginning to apply himself to the ambient side of his craft on \u2018Den Onde Kysten\u2019 and \u2018Han Som Reiste\u2019, though little synthesis occurs between the sometimes ugly and violent black metal and these softer instrumental moods. If one wishes to swiftly grasp how awkwardly Det Som Engang Var fits those styles together, look no further than the jarring transition from \u2018Lost Wisdom\u2019 to \u2018Han Som Reiste\u2019, which sounds like a new album has started to play. Also, note that fully half of the tracks here are instrumental (\u2018Svarte Troner\u2019 has printed lyrics, though you will only hear an uncertain murmuring on the track) and do little to contextualize the others, actively separating the four \u201ccontent pieces\u201d from each other. As such, the opening half of the album flows much better, as it contains three fully-formed songs back-to-back. On the whole, the only thread that I can truly perceive running through all of this is that quintessential Burzum feeling of loss and subsequent searching, which is apparent in almost all of Varg\u2019s work, even the bass tracks he laid down on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas.\n\nThe angles from which the songs approach loss are quite different to one another, \u2018Key to the Gate\u2019 shattering the reflective intro to pieces with shards of ugly riffing that belie for a brief moment what the early black metallers had been listening to \u2013 primal, dissonant music like Celtic Frost and Bathory. The extreme discord of the first 20 seconds and then the seething blastbeats of the first couple of verses may be the angriest manifestation of Burzum on any recording, since the drop into unsettling groove 90 seconds later is one that lasts almost for the entire album afterwards, frustrating most comparisons in terms of sound. Indeed, the leads that \u2018Key to the Gate\u2019 signs off on are neither dissonant nor aggressive, but rather peaceful if one can ignore the uneasy churn of rhythm guitar grating below. That weird pocket of beautiful suspense also describes where the long songs \u2018En Ring til aa Herske\u2019 and \u2018Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn\u2019 spend most of their time, doing relatively little with changes of pace or prominent riffs, though smoothing most of the music down into a low moan of restless guitar and backing croons topped by Varg\u2019s rare high shrieks. By contrast, \u2018Lost Wisdom\u2019 seems far more conventional as a riff piece, though again it seems oddly accessible, sort of with the pacing of a Pentagram song and similar catchy guitar ideas if one forgives the repetitive melody and tortured vocals.\n\nWhen considering just how widely the 40 minutes of music on Det Som Engang Var ranges, it hardly seems a surprise that the resulting listen feels a bit messy. The most extreme contrasts occur around the middle of the album, the lo-fi riffing catchiness of \u2018Lost Wisdom\u2019 transitioning into the medieval keyboard piece \u2018Han Som Reiste\u2019, then moving to guitar ideas on \u2018Naar Himmelen Klarner\u2019 that edge on to Candlemass in their grandiose yet sorrowful melodies, finally returning to dissonant blasting as \u2018Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn\u2019 breaks out. That the chaos of musical styles is mostly complemented by an overarching mood proves the highest recommendation for Det Som Engang Var, though the fact remains that the intro and outro seem quite needless, the ambient pieces are poorly implemented, and the longer songs had not yet reached the high level of composition that would mark out Hvis Lyset Tar Oss as something special. As with everything Varg Vikernes did in 1992, this album is best summarized as undoubtedly intriguing, but evidently showing the flaws of grasping the moment.\n",
        "\n\"Filosofem\" has become the most popular album of Burzum. Even Varg himself, who is critical towards his early works, has a positive opinion on this album nowadays. Possibly it's the most impulsive Burzum's album as a message. It means a lot for Varg. Its music was written in different periods of time, but it was recorded in critical period for Burzum, in 1993. Varg called \"Filosofem\" an anti-black metal album. It became a manifest against black metal scene of those days and, in some sense, it was opposing previous Burzum works. On the other hand, it developed the sound of Burzum, presented the darkness from the other perspective.\n\nStylistically the music of \"Filosofem\" differs from common black metal indeed. It's utterly slow. It's more depressive, than aggressive. It's highly influenced by ambient. The vocals are no longer black metal shrieks, but a kind of a distorted hissing. The biggest black metal-ish thing out there is a quality of the sound. The album is raw and this is a one of the most beautiful examples of rawness. A true beauty of an ugliness, so to speak. The guitars sound as chainsaws. And the second most black metal-ish thing is \"Jesus' Tod\", which is fast and has a variety of tremolo riffs. This composition has an outstanding raw energy, a mysterious dark atmosphere.\n\nSo, other compositions are low-paced. They are more monotonous and depressive. Some take \"Filosofem\" as another seed of depressive black metal and why not? The mood of the album's music is sorrowful indeed, as well as the lyrics. \"Dunkelheit\", however, sounds not exactly tragic, but as dark as it is possible with music. The track's title is translated as \"Darkness\", it's also called just \"Burzum\", and it represents darkness for 100%. It's an ideal connection of music and lyrics. The music creates the pictures, which are described in the lyrics, even without acknowledging, what's written in the lyrics.\n\n\"Erblicket die T\u00f6chter des Firmaments\" represents a crushing monotony. Both parts of \"Gebrechlichkeit\" are the most apathetic and depressive tracks of \"Filosofem\". It's even hard to say, that such music is black metal or even just metal. It's mixed with ambient and it sounds like a sort of guitar backed up ambient, especially in the second part, where there's no vocals. And \"Rundgang um die transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t\" is a fully ambient composition. It has a single melody stretched for nearly a half of an hour, but this melody is as meditative as prolonged it is. The depth of this track is bottomless.\n\nAn anti-black metal album has quickly turned to black metal classics. Why? Well, first of all, it was written in classical Burzum era. But, secondly, it expresses darkness in a perfect way, while darkness is a one of the most important features of black metal. Anyway, in this case it's not necessary to argue on a genre. As it has already been mentioned, \"Filosofem\" has features of several genres and sub-genres. The main thing about this album is its atmosphere. Hypnotic melodies of \"Filosofem\" do everything instead of any words and tags.\n",
        "\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is a turning point for Burzum. And for whole black metal. This album is considered to be the first atmospheric black metal. Of course, Burzum's music was atmospheric before that moment, but then it originated the subgenre, which was called atmospheric black metal or ambient black metal. It was more monotonous, repetitive and hypnotic type of black metal, which featured more keyboards and ambient influences. Before \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" Burzum's black metal and ambient were two separate dishes in the same plate, but then they were mixed. However, for Varg Vikernes all that stuff wasn't just about the style. Varg changed the sound because of personal issues.\n\nIn 1993 Varg was disappointed in black metal. Early in the year he came to disagreement with Euronymous after Varg's controversial interview to the local newspaper and the following events. Meanwhile black metal turned from the anti-trend to the new trend, which also was disappointing for Varg. So, Varg tried to separate himself from the scene. In 1993 he recorded \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", which represented his frustration. Actually, the material was written in the same time with the one for the previous albums, before 1993, but probably the final stages of its creation and the recording process were crucial. Probably the same was with \"Filosofem\", some of its tracks had been written before 1993 as well, but in their initial versions they just couldn't sound in a form, in which they were eventually recorded and released. Burzum sounded different at its early stages.\n\nSo, as it has already been mentioned, on \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" Burzum's music became more monotonous, repetitive and hypnotic. Yet the album also sounds grimmer, more oppressive, than the previous ones. \"Det Som En Gang Var\" opens with tragic ambience, which is backed up by primitive and anxious riffs. After such introduction there come rough and catchy guitars. The main riff of the composition is a one of the most memorable in Burzum's oeuvre. Then there will be more atmospheric and sorrowful, keyboard backed up melodies, changes of themes and eventually the composition ends in a dramatic fashion. \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" and \"Inn I Slottet Fra Dr\u00f8mmen\" are similar with their crushing monotony. But both compositions end with the diversity and the boosting of an atmosphere. \n\nIt's even fair to call the ending of \"Inn I Slottet Fra Dr\u00f8mmen\" a one of the album's highlights. The track has a sullen breakdown closer to its end, where the ambience is utterly cold and bleak. In the result \"Inn I Slottet Fra Dr\u00f8mmen\" finishes with a quite epic guitar solo. It's like a final outburst of the dark energy, after that episode there comes the conclusion of \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", which is fully ambient, as it has always been in Burzum's case before. Yet \"Tomhet\" is, again, more prolonged and monotonous in comparison to previous Burzum's ambient tracks. The title of this composition is translated as \"Emtiness\" and the music has something desolating in it indeed. At first there's just a meditative ambience, which is a kinda contrast to black metal \"loudness\" and harshness. Then there comes a flute-like melody, which sounds mournful and beautiful.\n\nMaybe without the keyboards \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" would have sounded more similar to \"Burzum\" and \"Det Som Engang Var\", but still the different mood can be noticed even with not counting the keyboards. \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is a one of the best Burzum albums because of its coldness and bleakness. It can be well heard, that this music wasn't driven only by hatred and darkness, it was also based on anxiety and oppression. In became the next step in the development of black metal, it became crucial for atmospheric black metal. It remains to be a one of the best albums of that subgenre.\n",
        "\n\"Det Som Engang Var\" is the second full-length album of Burzum. It is a one of the most important releases for black metal, however, its content is pretty far from being pure black metal. This is a dignity though. Varg has always demonstrated his interest in ambient. \"Det Som Engang Var\" has three ambient tracks. A one is a non-black metal instrumental. Four out of eight compositions are black metal. \"Key To The Gate\" and \"Lost Wisdom\" are dynamic and brisk, they have the remains of thrash metal in them. \"Key To The Gate\" in addition to all its greatness contains just an epic guitar solo. And \"Lost Wisdom\" is just too catchy.\n\n\"Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn\" is the most black metal composition of the album. It is based on a trademark for the genre thick \"wall of sound\" type of riffing. Its main melody is severe and dark. And \"En Ring Til \u00c5 Herske\" is the highlight of the album alongside with \"Lost Wisdom\". But these tracks have absolutely different moods. \"En Ring Til \u00c5 Herske\" is utterly slow-paced. Also, it sounds quite sorrowful and can be called the most depressive composition of the album. Tragedy is so piercing in it, yet the track still sounds harsh.\n\n\"Den Onde Kysten\" and \"Svarte Troner\" are the intro and the outro respectively. They are expectedly dark and dismal. \"Han Som Reiste\" is the remaining ambient composition of \"Det Som Engang Var\", but it is written in the style, that has never been featured on Burzum ambient tracks before. It isn't that dark, but still it has a mystical mood, a fantasy-like atmosphere.\"N\u00e5r Himmelen Klarner\" follows it and develops this kind of mood. It's instrumental and stylistically it is a more of doom, than black metal. Its title translates as \"When The Sky Clears\" and the title is descriptive, as the atmosphere of the track represents a sort of a solemnity after, for example, a won battle or stuff like that.\n\nThe mentioned things make \"Det Som Engang Var\" so special. This album has the trademark Burzum's hatred and tragedy, while it demonstrates more melodic and atmospheric elements. And it remains black metal after all those things. The debut album was a pretty diverse work and the following album overcomes its predecessor in that. Varg Vikernes was a truly creative musician in those times. However, Burzum's diversity wasn't over after \"Det Som Engang Var\". The journey has just begun.\n",
        "\nIs it necessary to tell, who Varg Vikernes is? Probably no. This is Burzum's debut album. It will be enough to say just a one thing: Varg had all the needed warm-up in Old Funeral, Kalashnikov, whatsoever, then he had some final stages of preparation with few Burzum demos and by the time of recording the self-titled album of Burzum Varg already reached his prime. Varg's main motivation, that gave him inspiration, wasn't too special. He was about revolting against the modern world and alongside with other Norwegian black metal pioneers he was against trendy death metal. Yet eventually the common motivation lead to extraordinary results. \"Burzum\" was a one of the first black metal albums and it was a one of the most specific at that time in Norway.\n\n\"Burzum\", or \"darkness\", has enough backup behind its name. It's grim beginning with the artwork, ending with music and lyrics. Raw sound, aggressive melodies, ferocious shrieking vocals - all those things establish the convincing darkness. And the aspect of the aggressiveness is the most defining for Burzum. It is based on vocals a lot and it makes Burzum stand out among other Norwegian formations of the early 90s. However, the album has a lot of intense moments from the instrumental side as well. An album opening \"Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\" and \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\", for example, sound dense, oppressive. On the other hand, the likes of \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\" and \"My Journey to the Stars\" settle the dark atmosphere not with explicit aggression, but with grim melodicism.\n\nYes, the music of the album is diverse and in the same time it always represents darkness. The two ambient compositions of \"Burzum\" proves this well. \"Channelling the Power of Souls into a New God\" sounds dismal and \"Dungeons of Darkness\" is just reflecting its title, it's actually a one of the few Burzum not ambient, but dark ambient tracks, as it is more noisy, not based on melodies. And in the context of the diversity a couple of other tracks should be mentioned. It's \"War\", that is written in the first wave black metal style and is presented as a Bathory tribute. And it's a short and sad instrumental \"The Crying Orc\", which follows \"War\" as an aftermath.\n\nSo, \"Burzum\" is filled with masterpieces, but still there's a highlight of the album. It is \"Spell of Destruction\", which is also called \"Black Spell of Destruction\" because of the fix by Euronymous of Mayhem, whose label originally released \"Burzum\". This composition is the slowest among black metal tracks of the album. It sounds much gloomier, than any other track. Some can name it as the first seeds of depressive black metal and that sounds trustworthy. After its main part \"Spell of Destruction\" has an absolutely fierce ending. Lead guitar provides a sorrowful melody there. Varg provides piercing, utterly desperate and hateful shrieks. That's the most intense moment of the album.\n\n\"Burzum\" is black metal classics, which is miles above the vast majority of the followers. It's a remarkable music, which is interesting to listen to because of its truly special songwriting and its convincing atmosphere of darkness. The diverse set of tools works for this single major criteria. Every composition of the album noticeably differs from any other and, of course, each of them carries its specific mood, yet all of them are the bricks in the same wall of darkness. This album masterfully represents its ideology. The question \"What is black metal?\" requires an answer in the form of Burzum's debut full-length album.\n",
        "\nThis is a one of the few Burzum demos and the longest one of them. It isn't the only value of the record though. The material of the release is quite interesting and, furthermore, the demo provides some questions even today, after Burzum has achieved a cult status and has become well-known leaving not much mysteries behind it.\n\nThe second demo contains 3 tracks from the first one and 9 previously unreleased tracks. Overall there are 9 separate compositions, as some of them repeat in different versions. Every composition is featured on some particular studio album of Burzum. Every except one - \"Depressive Visions Of The Cursed Warrior\". We'll talk about it later. The demo is fully instrumental, recorded and released by Varg himself. In fact, it's a compilation of rehearsal compositions. The rawest sound of Burzum is logically here. That's actually a one of the values of this record, the demo is for the most hardcore admirers of rawness.\n\nThe other value is in the fact, that some of the compositions significantly differ from their final versions. \"Channelling The Power Of Souls Into A New God\", for example, isn't that dismal in comparison to the full-length variation, but it's more melodic and sorrowful. \"Rite Of Cleansure\", which would turn to \"Dominus Sathanas\", is two times longer, than in its final version. The second half of the original contains more variations of the composition's mystical riffing. Anyway, for Burzum fans even the tracks, which aren't much different from the final editions, will be an interesting listen.\n\nNow it's time to talk about \"Depressive Visions Of The Cursed Warrior\". Varg himself claimed, that it wasn't a track of Burzum, and Varg had no idea of how that composition had appeared on the demo. It's a big question, if Varg forgot his own track or someone somehow managed to place it on Burzum's self-released record, or all today's photos of the demo actually show some fake editions. Anyway, all this stuff doesn't matter much, because \"Depressive Visions Of The Cursed Warrior\" is a great composition, it has a hypnotic doomy melody alternating with faster one, which represent a kind of a barbaric mood.\n\nSo, this demo has some interesting material indeed. Of course, the majority of final versions are better, but the original ones have their charm. In any case it's interesting to spectate the evolution of the legendary project, that's why the second demo of Burzum will find its listeners.\n",
        "\nFor some reason, when I was a 14 year old moron getting acquainted with the black metal scene, I really enjoyed Burzum's 4th album, Filosofem. In fact I pretty much considered it a masterpiece. Looking back on that regrettable phase in my life, however, I sort of have this slight hatred for it. Sure, it really isn't that bad of an album (and for the remainder of this review I will try to be as impartial as possible), but it feels to me like a cornerstone in a really bad part of my life. The thing that led me into becoming this self-described \"philosopher\" who ended up getting totally alienated. Besides that, Filosofem just isn't the ambient black metal masterpiece it's cracked up to be. \n\nFilosofem marks the point where Varg became less of a musician and more of what he is known as today. i have watched a lot of the dude's videos and read a lot of his articles, and he explains this album as sort of a rebellion from the whole black metal movement. His first three releases were different from those of more traditional black metal bands like Darkthrone in that they were more atmospheric, more tranquil feeling, and overall less oriented towards metalheads. This album, however, is a totally different story. Typical metal song structures have been totally abandoned, the production quality has intentionally declined, and the \"fun\" metal riffs that were occasional on the former three albums are almost gone here. Instead, there is a more ambient feel with this album. The song lengths range from seven minutes to almost a half hour, but there are very few ideas on Filosofem. Basically, pick any song of the album, start listening, and skip ahead a few minutes...you will probably still be hearing the same exact riff. I guess this isn't a bad thing in some contexts, like if you want to meditate, but for someone who likes more fun and complex music,Filiosofem is straight up drudgery. Still, on occasion, I manage to appreciate even the 25 fucking minute synth piece \"Rundgang um die transzendentale s\u00e4ule der singularit\u00e4t\" for its pleasant and calming atmosphere. \n\nAs for the songs themselves, there are some pretty good tracks on Filosofem. There is the aforementioned ambient piece, as well as the iconic \"Dunkelheit\". The rest run together into the atmospheric swamp, and that was likely Varg's intent...these songs aren't meant to stand on their own. There really aren't any particularly bad tracks on here either, but some may find \"Decrepitude\", the ambient guitar piece bookending the longer synth one to be a little grating, especially after sitting through everything. In fact, a lot of listeners may find themselves wanting to turn off this album about halfway through, and honestly they aren't missing much unless they want to meditate. \n\nLastly, this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning how Filosofem impacted the black metal scene in general. 1996 was kind of a shitty year for the genre as most of its founding members were dead, incarcerated, or moving on to more commercial territory. This album is what \"revitalized\" black metal as some might say. The way I see it, it spawned the shitty \"third wave\" of atmospheric bands. A bunch of poseurs who actually believed that this genre had some kind of potential decided that they too wanted to become mysterious solo artists, so they used the term \"atmosphere\" to justify the most repetitive, bland, shitty music. Some of it is actually okay, but there are thousands of kids in their basement who heard this and realized it was really easy to make music like this, without their parents even hearing. I speak from experience, and that ties into what I said about in the beginning. This album, while not THAT bad in and of itself, inspired me and many others to \"become the next Varg\", all within the confines of a bedroom or basement.\n",
        "\nBurzum needs no introduction whatsoever. The Varg Vikernes solo outfit was one of the pioneering black metal artistes of the day, and the low-fi sound production with the steady and determined guitar riffage combined to put him on another level. The atmospheric and ambient metal he was able to create in the '90s was some quality shit, so to speak. His first demo, however... well, it's kind of a different story.\n\nVarg recorded three instrumentals for this cassette, two of which would later be re-recorded on future releases. The problem with this demo isn't that the music is awful - it really isn't; right from the beginning, Burzum set itself apart with the quality on display. These are actually kind of nice instrumentals, all things considered. The real issue arises from the recording itself... it isn't good. Right from track one, it sounds as though someone just clicked \"record\" and started playing. Even then, that doesn't necessarily mean that it'd be terrible. I mean, black metal as a whole has never been a genre with great production - certain bands excluded - and at any rate, shit production quality was what made the genre \"unique\" at the time this was released.\n\nThe problem then doesn't stem from any sort of intention. The problem stems from what we actually get on this recording - a whole lot of air. Seriously. It sounds like someone was literally just recording air and then doing some metallic stuff in the background. It's certainly not in the forefront, and it's so quiet and poorly recorded that it takes a while before you realise there are actually drums on here. You can hear the guitar certainly, but the drums are so quiet that it takes keen listening powers to grasp their presence. Bass is another story completely. Someone with better hearing than I have would need to confirm that such an instrument is even on here.\n\nWhen you listen to this recording of, say, \"Lost Wisdom\", it comes as a sort of shock to hear it in comparison to the version on Det Som Engang Var. That song had some really emotional playing, with tortured vocals that helped create a shockingly beautiful atmosphere and made for a great song all-round. This version has nothing like that. Obviously, there are no vocals, but there's nothing really outstanding too. The bulk of the song is here, but it's too faint, too unassuming to really stick out to you and make you come back to it. The same sort of thing can be said for \"Spell Of Destruction\". The ambient keyboard piece \"Channeling....\" sets itself apart a bit because it's only been released on this demo, but even then it doesn't require coming back to this demo repeatedly.\n\nThe bulk is here for a master to push forth from the abyss, but it'd take better recording prowess to truly get that. Maybe some people like the sound of air in their black metal - I could see an argument made for that giving it 'atmosphere' - but for me, all I can use this for is background music. I prefer my metal to require my full attention, and this just doesn't really beg for that. It's only about fourteen minutes long, so it's not a waste of time to listen to - and thus I can't really give it an uber-low score - but I'd recommend listening to other parts of Burzum's career before coming to this. The novelty of it being the first recording is about the only special thing it's got. Other than that, it's mostly just air.\n",
        "\nVarg has always been on a mission of sorts, but now, rather than the mission being focused on the anti-Christianity of early black metal days Varg appears to be on a process of spiritual evolution, which is evidenced in the lyrics of Forgotten Realms. Check these out - \"Fathers and mothers from ancient times. Ghosts from a forgotten world. With wonder they look upon me; What took you so long? I wander not in darkness. I am not lost, nor bewildered. The path is not hidden. The tracks are not old. I was here a moment ago. I am home. I am home. I am home.\" - DEEP. \n\nVarg is not lost, he is on a spiritual quest and through an understanding of the way of our ancient ancestors, he suggests, we also might find the way. All of this is a lot easier understood if you follow Thulean Perspective and read Varg's books exploring our ancient Nordic roots and ancient Nordic wisdom. But, I don't think you have to read any of this stuff or even care about Varg to appreciate this track. \n\nIn all reality, this is not black metal. Sure, the entire song is lead by a fiery and psychedelic tremolo guitar but really, this tune is PSYCHEDELIC; If it was a whole hour piece I would definitely suggest taking something before this. Instead, it's just a 7 and a half minute little blurp into the mind of Varg and his continuing spiritual exploration. \n\nForgotten Realms again features Varg's \"talking\" style of singing, which appears not to be too well liked. I generally enjoy the \"talking\" style, preferably in Norwegian but I think it is effective here and it allows the entire English-speaking world to comprehend the spiritual message. I do think, though, that the vox weren't particularly well-recorded here and they lose a little bit of the epic effect showcased on other tunes like J\u00f3ln and Gullaldr from Umskiptar.\n\nI will say this is a tune that definitely deserves a couple spins, for it's spiritual message alone but also because when I first listened to it, I was thinking \"What is going on!?\". This is definitely not a traditional Burzum tune, nor a traditional black metal tune... but with more listens and an open mind I think it can be appreciated. It may seem a little absurd but I read an interview with Marduk guitarist Morgan Hakansson where he mentioned two of the things that make black metal black metal: \"Destruction\" and \"Spirituality\". Destruction is more of a Marduk thing, but \"Spirituality\" is definitely what makes up the better black metal for me, Like Burzum and specifically this song Forgotten Realms.\n",
        "\nThis album is a bag of mixed nuts, along with the band, but that's for a different day. My most major problem with this album is the length of the damn songs. I like my albums to have their songs vary in length, not all seven to eight minutes. The biggest offender for me in terms of song length, and probably with many others, is definitely \"Rundgang Um Die Tranzendentale Saule Der Singularitat,\" hence forth I won't talk about it as it has probably been ripped apart several times by other people. Besides that, the other track that I have a huge problem with is \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament.\" It is definitely one of the more glaring issues with this album. All tracks on this record are very repetitive, but this one is the worst offender besides a 25 minute \"instrumental.\" \n\nThe vocals and lyric content are monotonous at worst, and enjoyable at best. Varg Vikernes is not my favorite vocalist, and hasn't really impressed me at all, and whenever I listen to a Burzum record, it is my least favorite part of the listening experience. On this album, they are something that I kind of look forward to. I am not sure if it is how they are mixed, but they kind of compliment the \"quality.\" On \"Jesu D\u00f8d,\" when the vocals come back on, they sound a bit more quiet, more so than when they first came on. The lyrics are what get me, both in a good and bad way. They aren't the greatest, but they have a small bit of charm to them. It is naturalistic, not in how they sound no, but in their composition. They read as if Vikernes didn't go for the whole \"Christianity is bad!\" and \"Hail Satan!\" shtick on this record, but \"Jesu D\u00f8d\" does fall into this category, as it does translate to \"the death of Jesus\" in Danish. Besides that, the rest of the tracks have a very \"spiritual\" feel to them. \n\nThe atmosphere is really what keeps me from giving this a 60%, as it is really unlike anything that I have heard previous or since I decided to listen to this record. It is also where a lot of my praise lies. Filosofem is dark, moody, and heavy with a depressive weight over the tracks that lingers with you well after you are done listening to it. The vocals accompany the fuzzy, repetitive guitars and the drums give a feeling of doom and gloom that sustains itself through each song. It is honestly something that I truly can't explain well enough that it frustrates me. The only plus for \"Rundgang\" is that it is peaceful and and adds nicely to this album's atmosphere. \n\nThe conscious decision to have the production be one of the worst is very confusing to me, but it works, surprisingly. It gives that feel of \"TRVE KVLT\" while also sounding like the master tape was worn down by sand. A lot of black metal bands at the time were going for a \"lofi\" recording quality, but some sound like rip-offs of this record in terms of production quality. These normally don't work for the bands that are doing this, but with Burzum's Filosofem, it works very, very well.\n",
        "\nFilosofem is a ludicrous exercise in utmost distaste. It's a weird kind of untalented, uninspired non-music. The man behind the project, here going under his \u201creal\u201d name Varg Vikernes (born Kristian Vikernes), takes care of every instrument, the vocals, and lyrics on this album, as it has always been the case for him on every album of his aside from some contributions from other members of the early Norwegian black metal scene on his earlier efforts. This, of course, guarantees that every single thing he makes will have a very distinct, almost trademark style and sound to each and every one of his creations. Unfortunately, as much as this could be a good thing if he were to be creating something of worth, you\u2019d actually only be capable of enjoying his releases if you were looking for sounds that only serve to further the feeling of being dead inside, since the most characteristic trait these tracks on this album have is the fact that they\u2019re slow, boring, dreamy (not in a good or actually pleasing way), repetitive, droning, uncharacteristic. However, when I say dead inside, I\u2019m not at all implying that the music on this release is in any way depressive or sad-sounding, since it doesn\u2019t quite evoke any kind of emotions successfully whatsoever, neither positive nor negative, but rather numbs the listener into ultimate boredom instead, as it slowly flows clumsily into the most simple, less skilled black metal performance to be witnessed on a black metal album as popular as this one is. I honestly can\u2019t understand why anyone would willingly put themselves through this martyrdom. \n\nHow can it be that a song such as Dunkelheit, most likely Burzum\u2019s most famous composition, can be enjoyed by people who otherwise completely dislike black metal if it\u2019s black metal? Well, the fact that it\u2019s easy to consume by the masses (the shitty video for it even having been aired on fucking MTV of all places) is granted by the fact that Vikernes plays every instrument and lays the vocals down in a way that grants making everything sound extremely frail, uninteresting, uninspired, and weak, without this ever changing much throughout the record. Every component of this release is so basic it takes nothing to gather or understand what he\u2019s doing, because he\u2019s not doing much. \n\nI\u2019m going to start out by mentioning the drums because they\u2019re a key element to every black metal release of any worth. On Filosofem, they are barely even present. I just listened to the full album twice while gathering inspiration on how to accurately describe my dislike of this album and I can\u2019t even remember a single moment of the album when drums were featured, and if they were, what they were doing or what they even sound like. They\u2019re buried so deeply in the mix that they can\u2019t be distinguished from the rest of the noise, and their sound is just too weak for me to have any kind of recollection of them anyway, which obviously is a bad thing. Having the drums play a minimal role in a black metal record is akin to preparing a salad without lettuce and tomatoes, or drinking cola without caffeine and sugar: it\u2019s just useless, and nobody in their right mind should want it. I honestly can\u2019t get over the fact that this album is so praised in the genre when he can\u2019t even get the drum section to have a meaningful role in the overall composition of it. \n\nNow, the guitars. They don\u2019t sound necessarily bad, but he made the mistake of giving them a warm tone instead of a cold one. Sure, they do sound raspy and there\u2019s more than enough (way more than enough) of a drony, buzzy reverb to them, but they don\u2019t have a solid tone to them that they should have if he wanted to lay down a composition that had any kind of direction or groundwork upon which to build or place the rest of the elements, but again that\u2019s not happening on Filosofem. The guitars are very drony, very spacy even, but the riffs they play are nothing interesting, nothing original, nothing shocking. They\u2019re tired, rehashes of his own old riffs (which he has done and used even more of on consequent releases). They lack any kind of force or power to drive the tracks forward. The lead guitar shouldn\u2019t even be called lead here, since it leads nothing nowhere, but instead just infinitely circles around pointless intervals of single notes (or tritones, which the man seems to love to try and give the listener the impression that something is going on musically on the track), prolonged for a too long of an awkward amount of time for me to ever even think about getting any enjoyment from listening to them. Quite the contrary, they are so lame and tiring that they annoy me, as opposed to relaxing me or making me curious for what\u2019s coming next. \n\nThe vocals are probably the worst part. They easily take up the most space in the mix, and that could potentially be acceptable if they were in any way something interesting to hear, but they are not. The only parts I hate less of Filosofem are when the vocals aren\u2019t present, and even then it\u2019s still not a good instrumental piece (don't even get me started on the \"ambient\", which I'll reference soon). The vocal work is composed of unintelligible screams of high-pitched tone that all feel the same. They never change, he easily could\u2019ve spared himself the duty of having to hurt his vocal chords over and over again by making the same sounds on each of the actual \u201cblack metal\u201d tracks on the full-length and conveniently looped the first two or three screams, and the end effect would\u2019ve been 100% equivalent to what we ended up getting. They not only make it impossible for the drums to be heard (when they\u2019re playing at all), but also the guitars are overpowered by the empty, shallow, unemotional shrieks coming from what sounds like a sore throat with a cold. Also, if we\u2019re getting guitars without drums, or vocals without drums, or just guitars without anything else aside from a couple of bass notes and some horrible ambient, cheap sounding keyboard to back it up, what is this even? Why call it black metal when it really doesn\u2019t sound like it and doesn\u2019t feature its instruments properly? I\u2019m shocked. \n\nTo get to the end of the review, I can\u2019t forget to mention the pure ambient piece contained in the album, which is over 25 fucking minutes long, and it only has three notes (yes) that are played at different speeds (two speeds, to be precise) throughout its duration. This is in no way an exaggeration, but exactly what the track \u201cRundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\u201d is. Yeah, it\u2019s a \u201crundtg\u00e5ing\u201d alright, one that feels like a never-ending one at that, but it\u2019s not \u201ctranscendentale\u201d in the slightest. I have never liked Burzum\u2019s ambient work, and this is no exception. How could I? Anyone can do this, but, again, I believe this to be an example of who\u2019s behind the music giving the music a certain significance and a cult-like following of the author's every word, praising everything he does and says, even if what does is make bad music, such as is the case here. \n\nTo summarize, this is \u201cblack metal\u201d mixed with \u201cambient\u201d without the basic black metal elements and without any knowledge on how to actually create proper ambient music as opposed to something that you\u2019d hear looped playing in the background at an esoteric nature shop at 17:00 or something. Everything here is a stereotype of a stereotype, and it\u2019s so self-referential and self-jerky that it comes off as non-sincere and just plain valueless to me. \n\nI absolutely despise the music, sound, and style of Filosofem. This album was one of the first, clearest, undeniable symptoms of the black metal genre's unstoppable decline concerning quality and authenticity.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s actually surprising to me how one of the most praised and popularly acclaimed releases by the thoughtless masses supposedly or allegedly belonging to the black metal genre is actually one of the worst albums in the genre, and doesn\u2019t actually represent the genre whatsoever or make a valid presentation of its musical attributes in any way at all, but rather takes everything bad and of the lowest quality possible about it and condenses it in an almost parodic sea of thoughtless deviation and pointless randomization of looped passages of weak instrumentation and atrocious vocal sections of straight-up bad delivery. Can\u2019t forget about the worthless ambient passages that sound like a knock-off of more well thought-out, more styled-up, more elaborate, and all around higher quality ambient works. \n\nIf there\u2019s one single positive thing I can say about this release is the fact that it\u2019ll definitely make a lot of people who initially might have thought of black metal as an extreme genre stay the fuck away from it after listening to \u201cHvis lyset tar oss\u201d for fifteen minutes and beginning to fall asleep on the spot. At the same time though, quite ironically, this is actually one of the full-lengths that has brought black metal to the attention of the most random of idiots who actually don\u2019t know a single thing about black metal, yet feel like they\u2019re some kind of experts on the genre after having listened to this dishonest, frail piece of work that deconstructs everything of any quality that the originators of the genre built in favor of pointless faux-image, atmospheric drivel, and a frail, sad-sounding frontman that no one would want to listen to for too long unless being under the peril of contracting his apparent deadly disease that renders his emotions vain and his expression void of any kind of strength or attitude were an attractive thought to them. So perhaps driving away those wanting or looking for extremity in the genre isn't even a good thing.\n\nThe music on this whole album is completely forgettable and nothing to write home about. The riffs are paper thin, there\u2019s no real consistency to the melodies at hand, and the risk of them ever getting stuck in your head is minimal, as much as they\u2019re repeated time and time again needlessly throughout the endless minutes of duration of the only four tracks that make the grand total of 44 minutes and 28 seconds of running time. Both the first and the last track are over 14 minutes long for no reason at all. The musical ideas presented through each one of the tracks aren\u2019t necessarily all that bad per se, but they become absolutely unbearable when they\u2019re repeated and capitalized on time after time, after time, after time, after time, etc, ad infinitum. The endless droning is obviously supposed to be intended as an extra added atmospheric quality to the music, but this is not atmospheric black metal really, since it doesn\u2019t even properly reach that level, but instead it stays in a weird interval between the more solid tonalities or sounds and the weaker or more distorted tones of a proper atmospheric release, never daring or never risking too much, probably due to the lack of solid ideas or of confidence of the songwriter in his own skills.\n\nEvery instrument and the vocals (and, of course, the irrelevant lyrics) are handled by one same person, the man behind the band himself, here under the pseudonym \u201cGreifi Grishnackh\u201d. The bad part about this is the fact that if there\u2019s a part of an album you don\u2019t like by a band with multiple members, this can usually be overlooked by some other members\u2019 contribution to it, but if it\u2019s the style of a certain person you don\u2019t like, and that same individual is in charge of the guitars, the bass, the drums, and the vocals, chances are you aren\u2019t going to enjoy their playing and overall performance on the album. This is definitely the case for me here. \n\nThe guitars here have the most forgettable sound I\u2019ve heard on a black metal album. They sound extremely fragile and the tone to them is extremely weak. Unless you\u2019re completely focused on what\u2019s going on it\u2019s very easy to get lost and completely overlook what the riffs even are. It\u2019s not easy to get into it either since there\u2019s not much of interest concerning the guitar section either, as every riff is based on one idea that gets the centerpiece of the first three tracks and is \u201cexpanded upon\u201d in the most unimaginative and predictable way ever. One of the worst parts of this section of the mix is the fact that the guitars are accompanied by this kind of keyboard-y cheap sound that makes them sound even less serious and just adds a melodramatic overtone to them that comes off as cheesy. When they aren\u2019t completely drowned out by the machine-like, soulless drumming, that is, which leads me to having to point out how atrocious the mixing of the different levels is, particularly at certain points in the album, when one of the instruments is all you'll be able to make out from the amalgam of white noise that is the rest of them and the vocals.\n\nThe drums are incredibly standard: it\u2019s no secret that Cunt Kristna didn\u2019t know how to play drums very well at all because he hadn\u2019t even played them ever before attempting to record the first album for his one-man project Burzum. This shows, and it pretty much sums up just the overall attitude he has towards the music on this album (and on the rest of them too, and increasingly so with the passage of time as well), as he obviously has the will (and \u201cpassion\u201d, presumably) to create, but lacks the ability and the musicianship required to do so and have something of any kind of worth come out as the result. They sound phoned in, and that\u2019s not a good look since they\u2019re not only there to dictate the tempo of the music, but also to accentuate and make certain parts gain relevancy in the mix, not effectively and forcefully hide whatever it is you\u2019re trying to do with the other instruments anyway. \n\nThe vocals are raspy and very high-pitched. As opposed to sounding menacing, threatening, evil or mad, sound weak, and make me pity the poor chap screaming his lungs out and hurting his throat as opposed to fearing him, being scared by him, or thinking he\u2019s in any way cool or worthy of my admiration or otherwise respect of any kind. I believe much of what people perceive from his vocal delivery is all their minds\u2019 work due to what they know about the man behind the music, so they are quick to conjecture what a significance or true-to-life meaning there is behind them freely, but they\u2019d all the same instantly talk smack about it had a random guy they didn\u2019t know a thing about been behind these impotent vocals that render the music even more useless than it already is, to begin with. Also, what is it about the vocals not popping up after five minutes pass from the first of the four tracks? The arrangement of the tracks' sections is just extremely poor and really unintelligently laid out.\n\nTo add insult to injury, the last track is an ambient track that features some of the most laughable ambient work I\u2019ve had the displeasure of listening to in my life, just like every single time this guy has attempted to dwell into ambient territory. He just takes whatever intervals he believes sound deep, profound or cool and turns them, again, into masturbatory work that drives the listener nowhere but to an endless pit of boredom. \n\nThis album is very bad and I don\u2019t like the music. At all. I\u2019m against this kind of music being labeled black metal even, and also against every copycat band that ever replicated this and called their shit black metal as well.\n",
        "\nIf proof of this were still needed, the previous reviews demonstrate it in a very clear manner: I am absolutely narrow-minded, at least in terms of metal. I cannot understand how people really appreciate this classic so much that they give a rating of (almost) 100%. As one of the colleagues said, it's an album of two halves and they are so different that I do not have a clue how anyone can love both parts so deeply. But I have to realize that twelve reviewers have given 95% or more - I beg your pardon that I cannot join the ranks of these well-respected dudes. Varg Vikernes fascinates me with his metallic monuments, but the artistic idea behind the ambient excursions remains hidden for me. \n\nBe that as it may, \"Filosofem\" is an outstanding work. The large format of the limited edition with the fantastic drawings of Theodor Kittelsen indicates the exceptional quality of the music. No doubt, the folkloric monochrome pictures and the music of Varg are a perfect match. With both the cover and the booklet, Varg makes clear that black metal has a multi-layered structure - and a traditional, almost somewhat romantic facet. Black metal is a worldwide phenomenon, but it's no global style and much less internationally compatible than, for instance, thrash metal with its US American character. Of course, no law without exception, but hopefully you know what I mean. \n\nBut let's get back to \"Filosofem\". To be honest, \"Rundgang um die transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t\" (forgive me for using the German name of the title, sometimes I am a patriot) is one of the most boring pieces I have ever heard - and it lasts 25 minutes! This is a violation of the International Bill of Human Rights, isn't it? Admittedly, keyboards can be used cleverly, but their sound was not the reason why I begun to listen to metal. Aggravating the situation, Varg does not use them in an intelligent manner. The fragile, wannabe-mesmerizing tones of the song with the moronic title create an atmospheric atmosphere, but even this description is almost an euphemism. In spite of this atmosphere, the 25 minutes give me absolutely nothing. This means that almost 50% of the album make no sense, at least in my humble opinion. There is not even the smallest bit of metal in this song and inter alia because of this fact, it is just a waste of time.\n\nThank Odin, the first three tracks are light years away from this sonic soporific substance. Better still, their brute force is combined with truly hypnotic, coarse and irresistible melodies. To avoid misunderstandings, I am speaking of really minimalist yet extremely efficient melodies. They are accompanied by the prototypical, charismatic and raw voice of Varg and convey strong emotions. For example, the stoic and cold \"Dunkelheit\" reflects deep despair and apathy, but it casts its spell on the audience in a matter of seconds. By contrast, \"Jesus' Tod\" has more verve. Just like its neighbors, it avoids tempo changes and breaks wherever possible, but its speedy approach makes it unique in the context of the here presented material. The guitar riff seems to consist of thousands of spines that intend to torture the listener. The very distorted voice expresses hate and misanthropy, the double-bass guarantees the heavy groundwork and the devastating aura of this tune is simply second to none. And to close this ingenious chapter of Varg's creativity: \"Erblicket die T\u00f6chter des Firmaments\" lies between its two predecessors. It's great, voluminous, slow-paced and driven by an impressive guitar work. All songs profit from the dense, direct and icy sound of the album. No doubt, the guitars play the main role, nevertheless, the sound is well balanced.\n\nThe remaining two songs have one big advantage. They are shorter than the 25 minutes plague, nevertheless, these bastards of ambient and (some) metallic sounds do not really convince. Varg's lamenting voice gives the first part of \"Gebrechlichkeit\" a certain degree of brutality, but all in all, these tracks stand in the shadow of the big Norwegian spruce which is created by the opening trio. Honestly spoken, it doesn't matter. \"Filosofem\" spreads incomparable vibes, it was an identity creating work for broad parts of the scene and it definitely does not lack courage. Varg was a brilliant musician and his (unfortunately pretty sick) brain created an important milestone, regardless of the fact that I did not like each and every tune. So I give 75% for the music (but three times 100% for the songs of the first half), but let me add 5 percentage points due to the historical relevance of \"Filosofem\".\n",
        "\nEven though he still has somewhat of a cult-like following who will eat up any single thing he puts out, this man can be thankful he finally retired from making \u201cmusic\u201d. As much as I personally despise him for single-handedly ruining the early black metal scene with his jealousy and inadequacy only to multiple years later have the audacity to still insist he was rightful in his actions and lie to hundreds of thousands of gullible brain-dead teenagers on the internet about how things actually went down in the 90s, I can still appreciate his first full-length Burzum album as one of the cornerstones of the black metal genre, but this right here is absolutely nothing like it, and I'm not precisely referring to the obvious change of genre. \n\nThe Ways of Yore is an ambient album by otherwise black metal musician Kristian Vikernes of something more than an hour in length and no salvageable attributes, traits or qualities whatsoever. As much as any of his deranged (or simply idiotic) fan-boys would hate to admit it, this man got lazy and decided to release an album under the name of Burzum to somehow attempt to still milk the cow that partly brought food to the table back in 2014, without realizing the only thing doing such a thing would actually do is tarnish and disgrace his already not-so-bright legacy. \n\nThe music contained within this record is nothing interesting, good, or remarkable in any kind of manner. I think it'd be more than enough to say he completed this whole thing solely by the means of utilizing his wife's Mac (this shamelessly stated by himself). As much as he's trying to aim for some sort of mystical sound, attempting to sell this hot trash as supposedly \u201ctraditional European music\u201d on his own self-promotional YouTube channel, he doesn't quite succeed at it, and the whole album turns out to sound bland, boring and uninspired in general. It's safe to say the guy himself was bored while \u201ccomposing\u201d or making this. \n\nNone of the thirteen tracks really stand out for any particular reason or motive at all, as they all sound extremely similar (probably because they were engineered using the exact same program and features, all of them) and it's amazing how some of them are purely instrumental, without even featuring any kind of vocals at all (coincidentally the three last ones are just that, hinting at an attempt to hastily add some more content to the album to round it up to the hour mark probably to justify the release). Talking about the different \u201cinstruments\u201d (and I'm making use of quotation marks because they're all virtual), they all sound really plastic and inorganic, making the overall feeling and sound of this project come off as unbelievably weak, plastic (in the sense of digitally textured) and extremely simplistic (without that being a good thing in this case), giving off a very fake-deep and musically dishonest vibe throughout. It's also quite hard to distinguish what kind of instruments he's even \u201cplaying\u201d, since they don't really sound like any real counterparts would, but more like plain low-budget \u201celf movie\u201d sound effects. \n\nNone of the compositions on here are imaginative and they are usually various sets of easily predictable notes repeated time and time again with some very, very minor changes here and there to prevent the listener (or the composer) from falling asleep on the spot halfway through a song, while adding some chanting-style vocals on top of it which sound funny at best and sadly pathetic at worst. Either that or they are literal rehashes of some his old songs from Hvis lyset tar oss and Fallen turned into \"virtual form\" (sad butchering of already mediocre black metal tracks).\n\nAs I just suggested, not only does the instrumental component of the album come off as disingenuous and bland, but the vocals themselves, which would be the more \u201chuman\u201d or \u201creal\u201d side to this release, are sadly enough quite uninspired and lame as well, having no real bright moments whatsoever and never really being too risky either, always playing it extremely safe and attempting very hard to sound \u201cmedieval-chanting-like\u201d, if that's even a thing. They sound really ghostly (not in a flattering way) and at times creepy in the sense that they tend to come off as an old man crying for help on his deathbed. It's hard to believe they can reach such level of lameness sometimes. \n\nThe lyrics are also not that noteworthy or interesting either. Thinking that there might be some salvation for this project I dug into them hoping or rather longing to find some sort of sense as to why this man would decide to put this out there at all, but all they are are senseless and inconclusive ramblings about supposed pagan gods and overall regurgitated mythological ideas and tales of supposed European origin. \n\nAll in all, this project doesn't stand up to the standards of the ambient genre, and much less to those of traditional or folk music in general. It's a shame he decided to take his music in this direction since he probably has it in him to make quality black metal (or had, anyway). I can't find any single thing I enjoy or like about The Ways of Yore, so I believe it's good for him to finally have put his Burzum musical project to rest, but it's a real shame this is the thing that put the final nail in the coffin, as he could have left with a much more worthy last full-length album instead of this boring, unoriginal, uninspired ambient piece.\n",
        "\nIf he\u2019d called Aske - as he planned to - Inn I Dr\u00f8mmens Slott, I feel like Varg Vikernes would have built his reputation on more solid foundations of pagan mysticism and connections to the lost past. However, by placing the image of the cremated Fantoft Stave Church on the cover and even distributing lighters bearing a similar emblem, he opted for the juvenile and philosophically inconsequential ploy of declaring, \u201cLook at me! I\u2019m the guy who burns churches!\u201d Listening to the music on this sadly brief EP, it just doesn\u2019t make sense why he would choose that approach, since what he produced with Aske was by far the most mature and complete realization of his aims to that point.\n\nI\u2019m fully aware of the potential irony in what I\u2019ve just said, because one may not view any of the three songs here as \u201ccomplete\u201d in a literal sense. One is cut off with sudden violence while it seems to be in full flow, one is little more than an extended interlude, and the other is a rerecorded song from the self-titled debut, which was put to tape less than nine months earlier. That has been interpreted as lazy and pointless on several occasions. However, I\u2019m more interested in what Varg is doing than what he isn\u2019t, so it\u2019s worth noting the considerable improvement on the scratchy sound of Burzum and even the possible advantage over the feedback-drenched aura of Filosofem, which probably wasn\u2019t what the composer was aiming for despite its aptness. The guitar tone here is broader and flatter, rather like the contemporaneous sound of Det Som Engang Var which was, confusingly, recorded first and released later, a chronology that makes sense when we see how Varg had begun to favour repetition and the development of more song sections \u2013 a feature not seen on the second, rather piecemeal, full-length.\n\nWhat I find impossible to disregard about Aske is that the two longer songs feature excellent riffs. One might think that a comment about the riffs on an atmospheric black metal album like this is missing the point, though the only reason why early Burzum was atmospheric and not early Darkthrone was because the latter band had a drummer keen to change tempo and lyrics not known for their sadness. \u2018Stemmen fra T\u00e5rnet\u2019 sets a steady pace with meaty down-picked riffing that indeed sounds older than 1992 when considering the simplicity of it, though the main riff with its neat folky fill of an ending is the real treat, atmosphere added by the simple introduction of another guitar playing long slow chords in the background, then taken away to inject pace, along with double time on the drums. The same comment about age could be made about the filler piece \u2018Dominus Sathanas\u2019, since it bears a dark simplicity rarely heard out of any band after Burzum\u2019s own debut, barring the moodier sections of Vikingligr Veldi.\n\nAside from perhaps \u2018Jesu D\u00f8d\u2019, the Aske version of \u2018A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u2019 is the best evidence that Varg really was a great rhythm guitarist and composer, changing tempo between blastbeats and four-on-the-floor pacekeeping that turns riffs from strident to lamenting in an instant. The middle of the song dwells in a long slump of energy as a result of its repetitious monotony, though the vocals crucially keep the mood alive, narrating lyrics that are intriguing in their references, though perhaps better read along with the music as they are pretty unintelligible. When the rollicking main riff comes round again, however, there is great cause for celebration. I find the whole experience of \u2018A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u2019 to be an isolated epic journey back through the centuries and right to the heart of the miserable sense of lost past that I see Varg trying to articulate in much of his work. I also feel like this song communicates that feeling a lot more creatively than the similar attempts on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, an album which is sublime in its capturing of mood yet not captivating in its song dynamics or momentary highlights.\n\nAs you might guess from all that, I feel like Aske is an opportunity missed for the Burzum name and also a little gem often neglected, since an album full of songs like we have here \u2013 released under a different title and with different artwork \u2013 would have been a wonderful addition to a strong discography, perhaps working in tandem with Hvis Lyset Tar Oss to expound the nature of Varg\u2019s philosophical base. As it is, this is still very interesting, but not nearly of as much value as it could have been.\n",
        "\nBurzum\u2019s Filosofem was easily one of the albums that drew me into black metal. The overbearing volume, the molding of the distorted dissonance together to build atmosphere alongside the reverberated synth resonated with me like no other album to date, the underproduced vocals and the inspirational lyricism is forever a bastion of what good atmospheric black metal is to me.\n\nThe instrumentation of this album is minimalistic and precise. The drum tracks are precise and; albeit minimalistic, very memorable. The guitar riffs both dissonant on songs like \u201cJesu D\u00f8d\u201d or melancholy on songs like \u201cDunkelheit\u201d, and the experimentation on tracks like \u201cDecrepitude II\u201d is unbelievable. He got away with playing an Am chord with a soft melancholy melody for 8 minutes, and it sounds fucking cool as hell. The overbearing dissonance on the album is elaborately atmospheric, whatever fuzz pedal he\u2019s using really sounds like rain at some points.\n\nThe lyricism on the album is inspiring and represents the \u201catmospheric black metal\u201d genre is the way that it incorporates darkness, nihilism, and paganism. The vocals coincide very well with the already overly distorted guitar, the underproduced nature of them is very desirable and I wish I heard it more from more modern bands of the genre.\n\nFilosofem is an incredible ode to what atmospheric black metal should be. Bands like Ulver, or Agalloch turned the music a different direction from dark ambient, more aligned towards folk metal. But the aspects of atmospheric black metal that birthed with Burzum did not die with him, and many artists like Leviathan continue to approach atmospheric black metal; and black metal in general, with an experimental-dark-ambient fervor like Varg himself.\n\n100%, without a doubt 100%.\n",
        "\nBurzum\u2019s debut echoed what was to come of the Burzum project. I find it hard to believe that all of the first four albums were written (presumably) and recorded in such a short amount of time. In barely two years Varg had managed to not only write some of the most defining and memorable songs of the genre, but helped influence many artists to follow in the black metal footsteps with experimentalism and a mix and blend of what would soon be called \u201cDungeon Synth\u201d and elements of dark ambient.\n\nThis album consists primarily of songs composed like old style heavy metal songs, with a fuzzy distortion and screamed vocals. Which was to be expected from an up-and-coming black metal artist in Norway in the 90\u2019s; however; the idea that this album, and an album like Filosofem could be recorded so close together is incredible, as this album shows the incorporation of dissonance and distortion, but lacks the overbearing volume and general composition typical of an album like Filosofem, where the guitars dissonance often blends together. Repetition is present on some of the tracks, again to a lesser extent. All of which echoed what to come of the Burzum project.\n\nTwo examples of more \u201cheavy metal\u201d style riffing on the album are on \u201cWar\u201d, and \u201cStemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet\u201d. Where there is little dissonance in the chords chosen to write the main riffs, and the drums have a sort of \u201cIron Maiden\u201d feel to me. Besides that, I think the album is a wonderful composition of the previous demos that led up to the point, he clearly worked on his playing ability and composition throughout the years leading up to the debut. \n\nOverall I give I think the album deserves a 70%. It is telling of the future of the project but outside of that it seems like a proof of concept in very mild experimentation, high pitched harsh vocals, distorted guitars, and slower beats than what was typical of death metal at the time.\n",
        "\nWhat can be said about \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" that hasn't already been said? Most people hate it, and considering Varg used MIDI only on this release in 1994/1995, that alone is pretty damning for most listeners. It doesn't help that every track is in the same droning, atmospheric style Burzum is known for, which was cemented in the previous album, \"Filosofem\". So why am I giving this album an 85, despite it's flaws? Because I love it. This album, along with his previous ambient works, are what got me into dungeon synth/darkwave/whatever you want to call it in the first place. \n\nI've heard complaints that the MIDI sound font used on the album takes away any and all atmosphere that Varg was trying to achieve, and while it's probably not what he had in mind, I disagree. Yes, most of the tracks do drone on, but back to the previous album for a minute. Is there any reason why \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\" should be 25 minutes long when it has seemingly one or two changes over the course of the track? Over the years, I've warmed up to it, but I feel that the atmosphere created in the tracks on \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" come across better. As I'm listening to it right now, I almost feel like I'm in a medieval castle myself listening to a court musician play dirges...OK, maybe nothing that pretentious.\n\nThe album's concept is supposed to be about the story of Balder, but none of the tracks have lyrics. Instead, descriptions of \"what the atmosphere of each track should be\" are given...in old Norse. Yeah, alright Varg, you're very kvlt, we get it. I see that there are translations in English, however. I don't really care about the concept too much. I'm also not familiar with the story of Balder, but it seems like an interesting enough subject to look into. However, I don't agree with having to describe what each track is supposed to \"feel like\", but if that's the only way to stick to the concept, so be it.\n\nI've heard this album be described as \"video game music\", among other things. Plinking piano, orchestral and choir samples fill the album's 40 minute running time. As someone that appreciates game soundtracks, I can appreciate it on that level as well. If Varg had access to proper synth at the time, this album might of been a classic in the eyes of Burzum fans, it might of been worse, who knows. It's an ambient album made with MIDI, and it's great. Not for everyone, even dungeon synth/dark ambient fans.\n",
        "\nThere are two kinds of great albums. There are albums that have some truly brilliant songs that make the album great even if you never listen to it fully through, and then there are albums that might not have the greatest individual songs but as an album work perfectly to make a truly great album. Filosofem fits perfectly into both of these categories, albeit in a very interesting way. Filosofem can very easily be broken up into two halves, part one containing three excellent pieces of atmospheric black metal, and part two comprising of three ambient tracks. Part one reads like the former kind of great album, with each song really being as close to perfect as you can get when it comes to this particular strain of black metal. Part two reads like the latter kind of great album, while each individual track from this part might not fully stand on their own when combined they work together incredibly well and elevate each other to a place of greatness. With these two halves combined, the result is a masterpiece of an album both in terms of songs and album structure.\n\nOn your first listen to the album you might will feel that the second half is somewhat of a disappointment and that the raw energy of the first half just kind of puttered out with an anticlimactic ending. This could be said to be true if you view Filosofem only as one unit instead of two separate halves, and so I feel that one must listen to both halves independently of each other in order to appreciate the album fully. When approached like this, the second half of the album makes complete sense. The three ambient tracks were never supposed to be the end of the album, but the beginning, middle and end of their own mini-album. So if at first you feel that Filosofem just has three great tracks and then kind of loses the threat, try just listening to the second half on its own and you might find your opinion of it changing.\n\nThe album is all about atmosphere and it has that is spades. From the strange, horn-like call that opens the album (which makes the brilliant album cover art even more fitting) the cold, sombre atmosphere is maintained perfectly throughout Filosofem. The production of the album is just perfect in adding to this atmosphere. That's not to say the recording quality is really that good, as Varg went out of his way to make sure the production quality was as low as possible (he recorded the vocals on a headset microphone after requesting the worst possible microphone from his sound technician, for example) and this works wonders for the atmosphere of the album. The production is never thin, verging on a 'wall of sound' style production during the first half and while there is much more sonic breathing space in the second half there is still a lot of depth to the production. All of the instruments are balanced perfectly with the subtle synth notes being a particularly nice element in the opening track Burzum. The vocals are excellent, strangled and harsh and quite low in the mix compared to other black metal albums. The spoken word segments are also very effective, and overall the production really elevates all of the compositions on the album.\n\nTwo thing that define Filosofem are minimalism and repetition. Throughout the album both of these traits can be found,largely through the use of pretty much only one simple riff in each song being repeated with only minor variation. These are not short songs either, the shortest track clocking in at 7:05. It's a testament to how perfect these riffs are that Varg manages to never let a song get boring with such a minimalistic approach. Not only is repetition found within the songs, but Decrepitude I and Decrepitude II are basically copies of each other with changes made to production (Decrepitude II is softer in tone with the guitars lower in the mix and no vocals amongst some other subtle yet very important differences). This isn't laziness, however, and in the context of the album this is a perfect example of how repetition works so well in the right hands.\n\nFrom my review score you can see that I couldn't quite bring myself to give Filosofem the full 100%, and the only reason for that is the running time of the sprawling, minimalistic ambient piece Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte, which comes out to 25:11. While I don't have any problem with this track as many others seem to from reading other reviews (again, when taking this album as two halves this track makes perfect sense), I feel that shortening it to 10 or even 15 minutes in length would get the same effect across and make it a little less time consuming to get through when listening to the album fully through. Shortening would take away from the almost endless, drone-like nature of the track so I can happily live with it as it is, but if I had to have one criticism (a very minor one at that) of the album it would be have to be that.\n\nFinally, the great thing about Filosofem is that after taking both halves on their own, evaluating them on their merits separately and treating them as two mini-albums, they really do go perfectly together. They manage to have in stark contrast with each other while also fitting together so perfectly in terms of tone and atmosphere. I believe that while Filosofem could easily have been released as a two separate EP and while both of them would have been excellent in their own regards, it's the combining of these two halves that really make Filosofem what it is: brilliant, challenging and truly unique.\n\n\nStand out tracks: Burzum, Erblicket die T\u00f6chter des Firmaments, Decrepitude II\n",
        "\nWell, two additional years have gone by since Varg's previous release, which is entitled \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\". Here we are, back in 1999 (metaphorically, of course). A lot of improvement has surfaced since the 1997 record was first released. Keep in mind that Varg was still in prison during this time as well. Not to mention Burzum's final release, one-year before he concluded the band's first run. According to Varg, if I remember precisely, during a prison interview, he mentioned he was allowed to use a keyboard for two weeks when he was assembling the Dau\u00f0i Baldrs album, which in my opinion, was probably the biggest mistake that Burzum have ever distressed. But enough of that, let's get back to this record, Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf. As I was mentioning, during that same prison interview Varg was given a keyboard, yet again (not sure if it was the same model or an entirely different one, yet this one sounds more advanced than the previous one). During this attempt at making an ambient record, Varg was quite successful nonetheless. Varg managed to create this delicate-sounding piece of art in a week's less time than his previous foundation, which was (and still very much is) worth less than one-thousand-year-old shit (seriously). \n\nAs noted in the paragraph above, I stated he was allowed to use a keyboard once more, which was, in all honesty, a brilliant idea this time around. Varg literally took the time he was given and put some serious thought into forming this alluring record. The built-in synths on this keyboard are so much more attractive than the previous synths that were displayed on his last release. The simplicity is still there, in all fairness. The point is, it's not nearly as dreadful and it occurs a lot less. And I mean a lot less. This album actually develops, matures, progresses and it's at a slower pace, which is perfectly magnificent for ambient music. I don't see what the problem with that would be? Varg's actually using instruments featured on the keyboard that are absolutely acceptable as an ambient-themed release. This is far from a failing record. I can't see anyone displaying more hatred for this release than his last one. By all means, this is not a terrible album. You could even suggest that Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf's theme would be featured in an early 1990s Disney-animated, motion picture. \n\nOn another plus noteworthy mention, the ambient tracks are a lot shorter than his last album. With the fair amount of simplicity on this record and with the album still featuring repetitiveness (though, not to an extreme and unfathomable distance this time), by having shorter tracks, it doesn't make the musical assembly extraordinarily nettlesome. My three personal favourites on this record, not in actual order, just the order of how the album lines them up, are \"Tuistos Herz\", \"Ansuzgardaraiw\u00f4\" and finally \"Die Liebe Ner\u00feus\". All the ambient tracks are good though. This would be the kind of music you would want to listen to on a calm, rainy afternoon, just looking out the dampened window into an empty field. \n\nThey're such wonderful and dainty piano harmonies throughout some of this record, alongside a tremolo. Also, a great deal of suspense is carried out throughout the entire thirty-three-minute album. Something it could relate to in an Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode even. There are just so many possibilities where this record could be displayed in film or television of many sorts. One could even shed tears to this album, that's how powerful it's tune truly is altogether. I've listened to this album four times and I could honestly listen to it evermore. A lot of love and passionate melodies entirely. There are also a lot of calamity-related melodies, it can be deeply saddening at times, too. I would suggest this to a decently high degree, that this would be a piece of masterwork. You can almost imagine yourself being displayed on a filming screen (watching yourself), dead center adventuring deeply within a very misty and dank forest. \n\nThis album produces so much assurance, I can't see how one would feel disappointed listening to it. I feel Varg's limitation wasn't nearly as limited as the last time. There is an astronomical aggregate of untainted imagination published here, incredible really. This is how ambience should sound, quite honestly. It's lust for adventure is boundless. It has the drive to do more than it does. And it does a lot as it is. Very beautiful audio, almost crystal clear. Really smooth, no distorted quality. One wouldn't expect this to be something Burzum would release, but in reality it only exists because of Burzum. This is an extremely delicate album and should be appreciated by everyone. Varg should be absolutely proud of this work, you can visualize that this came from the heart. An effort not at all wasted or despised. It's a bit of a ignominy that this album didn't become more famous for what it displayed (and still displays) during it's time. \n\nThe atmospheric essence captures your imagination and takes you away from a very real reality. There is so much to explore in this album, it's like an exciting journey, you could live it evermore. Like a millennium configuration, this needs to be always remembered. There was too much put into this beautiful recording to be ignored. You wouldn't think something so deeply formidable could be constructed in prison. Varg's talents really glistened when he was creating this album's atmosphere. Extremely emotional. Even velvety drums are trademarked on and off throughout the record, which adds a bass-themed depth. The melodic flute-playing is very soothing. Hell, this entire album could have done very, very well as a symphonic black metal record, created by Burzum. Who knows, we may not have even got this fine piece of work if Varg hadn't been in prison? That's something to think about. We'll never really know. \n\nYes, this album should be suggested to anyone and everyone, for that matter! It's blended and formed so well, you can't just hate this release because of it not being black metal. You have to be open-minded and realistic about it. I'm not saying it's going to suit everyone's interest, but it should be listened to once by everyone, just to try it out. It's very adventures and keep you interested, that's what a good album does. It makes you return for more each time. It also has a mighty sense of drama. This isn't the sound Varg started off with on his debut album, which is self-titled as \"Burzum\". This is definitely not the Burzum from 1992-1996 either. This is man who has turned Burzum into a project with multiple sounds and not one particular sound. He's blossomed the band's general theme altogether. I'm happy to see this side of Varg emerge the way he did. There's a great amount of verity right here. I would very much suggest this as one of the first (possibly the first in general) recommended albums to share to anyone who're just getting into Burzum. I wouldn't waste the chance showing someone who has a stalwart sense of musical value this. If you're into ambient-based music or even classical-styled music, and if you haven't heard this fantastic album yet and enjoy Burzum's work, I very much recommend giving it a try. It's utterly amazing!\n",
        "\nHate to have this sound harsh but here goes. What the hell was Varg thinking when he created this buffoon music? I understand he was in prison during this time in his life, but still. No noteworthy effort was put into the release. This isn't black metal at all. I wouldn't even contemplate this being any form of ambience either. Judging by the album artwork, one could assume the music within would be admirable, but it's not, not at all. In fact, quite straightforwardly, it's the absolute reverse. The simplicity is almost illusory. In no way, would I even attempt to abuse the mentally-disabled with the unvarying simplicity of this terrifying record.\n\nThis record is created using some form of computerized synths. However, the prison allowing Varg to have access to this sort of creativity is beyond me. It's discouraging knowing this record even exists. I guess if you're already dead and want this played at your funeral, it would probably be suitable. At least you wouldn't hear it since you'd be dead. But why depress the visitors paying their respects to you even more by forcing this catastrophe upon them? You know it's wrong! If I have to say anything positive about this release, it would be the production of the audio. It's undoubtedly cleaner and more crisp than what Burzum tends to release. The sound of the instruments themselves aren't all that bad, but that persistent trumpet loop on the first track, which is self-titled with the same name as the album \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\", is completely and utterly annoying. It must repeat itself about four times in those nine minutes at least. In fact, all the tracks on here are dragged on like this. It's just awful. If Varg would have taken this a lot more seriously, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs could have been one of his better establishments. You would expect hearing this unspeakable foundation on an Nintendo 64 video game cartridge. Hell, even classic video game music sounds better than this pandemonium. \n\nI've listened to this record three times. And each time, I could feel a little part of myself dying because of it. Even in a form of ambience (which I wouldn't literally suggest it as being so), it fails beyond belief, on every possible level. The primary reason this shameless album is unforgettable is because of the unadulterated recurrence it displays. I mean, who the hell thinks, in their right mind, that this is a magnum opus? The damn tracks are too fucking long for the amount of repeated loops featured in each individual song. Varg would create a tiny section of (dreadful) music and copy and paste it, one-by-one, each time. A surgeon probably should have had X-rays done on Varg's head before he released this abhorrent piece of shit. Maybe he was mentally ill or something? Because no one with a good head on their shoulders would have made this disaster. Why did he have to prolong the tracks for as long as he did? It wouldn't have been so bad if each track would have shown a deep sense of depth. Not like, four instruments being featured on each track, constantly repeating themselves within seconds apart. This would be expected out of something in The Legend of Zelda, if the Zelda series sucked entirely. \n\nMy favourite part of the album surely isn't the fucking music, if that's what you would want to attempt at calling this agony. No, my favourite part of the album would be the artwork. At least Varg had that going for Burzum. That was well-detailed, why couldn't the music have been, too? The state of mind displayed in the album in general would be on the lazy side. I would never spend my own money on purchasing this godawful fragment of goat snot. Firstly, if anyone suggested this nightmare to someone else, the person suggesting it needs help. This creation is utterly absurd. There's no maturation, development or interest put into this whatsoever. Not to mention, no imagination. The atmosphere is completely dull, like pencil squeaking on lined-paper in school because you're too lazy to get up and sharpen it beside the teacher's desk. Varg's lacking abilities and music compositions are completely unacceptable and unnecessary here. Would have been better off not making music until being released from prison, then continue onward. \n\nIt matters not how you put this, the entire forty-minute record doesn't provide much adventure and is completely and shamelessly boring. It never progressed, it just remained the same during the whole time. What a thoroughgoing waste of my, other listeners and Varg's time especially. If you're going to listen to anything created by Burzum, for your own sanity, listen to something else, not this goddamn mistake.\n",
        "\nBurzum are (in this case, \"is\" because of the group being a one-man project) a Norwegian black metal and ambient band. Probably one of the most well-known black metal bands of the second-wave, not to mention one of the absolute distinguished eternally. Burzum have a primeval audio fabrication on this record. The methodology of formation is very original. Such a phlegmatic form of music. Nothing drastic about the instrumental construction whatsoever, by any means. \n\nIf anyone is exploring old school, classic black metal, you need not seek any further. You may receive some form of displeasure concentrating on this record, it trademarks a somewhat different sound than many traditional black metal bands, especially vocally. I would go as far as suggesting that the vocals used sound a lot like modern, depressive black metal vocalists. Clean vocals are also featured in small quantities. The release measures a considerable amount of orchestral-themed ambience. \n\nBurzum's guitar-playing is very idiosyncratic within it's own right. It's far from tortuous, it's more melodic. Such comforting solos as well. Amalgamated with immaculately exquisite drumming and delicate bass-playing. The atmosphere of the album is pitch-dark, mysterious and atypical. Almost something out of a black and white horror motion picture. One instrument doesn't outweigh the other on this decently-rounded album, which makes for a pretty unbiased release. All options were on the table when this was recorded. The more instruments that were added, the more depth it generated. By adding a substantial volume of ambience, it played the part completely well. The vocals on the other hand, lacked an honest quantity of prospective and could have been done better. \n\nInstrumentally, this release did excellent. The imagination being put into the instrumental formation was clever and blended well. The high-pitched vocals were unsatisfying and whiny. It's almost unfathomably wretched. I wouldn't strongly suggest this record to anyone and it wouldn't be my first pick as a suggestion at all. If one can survive and even adapt to listening to the dreadful vocals being applied throughout the album, then it makes for a pretty proper record. If you adore primeval audio fabrication, then take the time and judge it for yourself. This is unquestionably a class B particle of sweat.\n",
        "\nI don't really see why Kristian Vikernes felt the need to re-record a bunch of his old songs. The bad production, as well as the raw vocals, was what gave it character, and without it, it's not nearly as good. \n\nThe very first thing I'd like to discuss, is the introductions. There are three introductions, for whatever reason. I don't see why he felt the need to have so many, as none of them really add anything to the album at all. For the most part, they're just a bunch of ambient noise, no real melody or point whatsoever. Furthermore, I'd like to state my opinion about the choice of songs. I think his choice of songs was bad, the two songs that aren't from the debut, are from ''Det Som Engang Var''. The rest is, as stated, from the debut, and though I know many will disagree, most of the songs from the debut weren't too amazing. When they're taken away from the debut, they lose what really made them interesting, which is their historical importance. The only reason why I listen to the debut from time to time (though quite rarely) is because of how important it was to the black metal scene. Without their trademark production, and tortured screams, they're not really anything special anymore.\n\nA big problem I have with this is the vocals. They aren't really even shrieks, they're just semi-harsh whispers. They just feel so tame. No aggression, no emotion, no passion, nothing. When, on the original, he screams \"Ea, lord of the depths\", you feel the rawness and aggression, however when he whispers it on this, it doesn't really warrant any reaction or emotion, it's just kinda \"eh\". On to the production. Everything sounds so clean and sterile, especially the drums. I must admit, I really liked the bad sound of the drums on the debut, you know, the garbage can sound of the snare, how it sounded like a car with a flat tire driving at the blast beats. I often found it hard not to drum along with my fingers, they felt like an important part of the music. Here, it's just a bit boring. Just as the vocals, they don't warrant any real reaction.\n\nWhat I really don't get, is why re-record old songs if you don't do anything with them? Some tempos are changed, and some riffs repeated more times, and some melodies are played in lower keys, but they're essentially the same. I'd get why he would want to re-record if he had new things to add to the songs; renew the songs, rewrite riffs, maybe add some synths maybe, at least then it would feel like there was a point to the re-recording, but there's virtually no changes made. So why bother re-recording when there's no changes to add? Why re-record when you're already satisfied with the songs? \n\nRight, so where there anything this album got right? No, not really. This just feels like a waste of time. There's absolutely no point to listening to this rather than the original \"Burzum\" and \"Det Som Engang Var\".\n",
        "\n\"Hvis lyset tar oss\" was the greatest black metal album to ever be created and, by that notion, was also the best Burzum album to be created. Well, I know that can be argued, so I'll say \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" is my FAVORITE of these albums crafted throughout black metal's near 33 years of existence. \"Filosofem\" was the album which followed and, like its predecessor, many people consider it to be Varg's finest output. I myself consider this to be second. However, it is still, by all means, a perfect album. This was Varg attempting to make an \"anti black metal\" record. And in a way, he succeeded. This is not the blasphemous, aggressive, fast black metal that was \"all the rage\" in 1996, as well as the time of this album's production and recording in 1993. Varg's last metal album until 2009's \"Belus\", \"Filosofem\" is a perfect mix of lo-fi metal and ambient. It's more ambient than \"Hvis\" and less metal, yet, there are 20 more minutes of music to get through this time around.\n\nAs we are very well aware of here, Varg's opted production job on \"Filosofem\" is one that is often either criticized or adored by black metal fans alike. The guitars are extremely fuzzy and contain this buzzing atmosphere that sounds a little more clear this time around but also quite a bit more layered. I'm not sure how many guitars are playing at once but it sounds like more than two. There is a lot of distortion on these songs aside from the pure ambient piece \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\". This song is \"Filosofem's\" \"Tomhet\". It's about ten minutes longer though, at 25 minutes long. It's more than a third of the album's length in a single track. While it can be a tedious, repetitive listen, it's very hypnotic; the entire album seems to focus on repetition and hypnotism as musical ideals which shouldn't be surprising coming from a Burzum record. It's elevated quite a bit more here. Aside from this dark ambient piece, there are keyboards throughout the rest of the album. \"Dunkelheit\" has some simplistic keys amongst the distorted guitar riffs, which are also repetitively droning.\n\nI do apologize for going off track from the guitars to discuss the keyboards. As I was saying, these guitars sound very layered and distorted. It's probably Burzum's most distorted album along with \"Belus\" except this has more ambiance. \"Dunkelheit\" is an extremely dark track and is the German translation of Burzum which, of course, means \"darkness\". This song starts the album off at a very high level and luckily it doesn't manage to tank throughout it's just over an hour long runtime. \"Dunkelheit\" ends and goes into what I beleive to be the actual crowning jewel of the album, \"Jesus' Tod\", which is the German translation of \"Jesu d\u00f8d\" in Norwegian and \"Jesus' Death\" in English (from here on out, I think I'm just going to use the original titles of these tracks. My version of the CD happens to have German song titles). This song has riffs in it that were re-used in Burzum's next album \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" in a dark ambient style. Here, they sound way more effective and eerie. The repetition works really well here and the pace of this song doesn't change, staying at a fast-ish mid-pace the entire 8 and a half minutes. \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\" also contains some great riffs, a bit more on the melodic side, that slow the pace down a bit before that 25-minute ambient excursion. I think the lower points of the album are the two \"Decrepitude\" tracks, though the second is a bit lower in quality than the first. Either way, these songs are still very good and effective in what they evoke musically. There isn't one single bad music idea to hear on this album. \n\n\"Filosofem\" is also one of Varg's best lyrical adventures with which to walk down a barren winter path just before hypothermia sets in and your life ends, numb and frigid. The lyrical passage in \"Dunkelheit\" repeats the same verses twice:\n\n\"When night falls\nShe cloaks the world\nIn impenetrable darkness\nA chill rises from the soil\nAnd contaminates the air\nSuddenly...\nLife has new meaning\"\n\nThis meaning of life Varg speaks of must be one of the \"impenetratable darkness\" one experiences as their body is completely frozen by the \"chill\" which \"rises from the soil\". \"Jesu d\u00f8d\" is the only track of the four featuring lyrics to contain Norwegian lyrics, which aside from the 1992 self-titled album, are extremely common in Burzum's music. Aside from \"Dunkelheit\", \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\" features some of my favorite lyrics here, which seem to be about a man as he wonders what he will miss in the Spring and Day, and alludes to an eternal life of immortality, remembering his past adventures. It's an interesting concept and Varg's harsh, screaming vocals are done in less of a depressive scream and more of a standard rasp. \n\nThis is not music to listen to when you're casually trying to experience black metal for the first time. For that, I'd go with Mayhem or Darkthrone, or perhaps Carpathian Forest, if you're going the non-Dimmu Borgir route. No, this is an album to experience if you're serious about this style of music and want to hear something completely haunting and frightening, yet so beautiful at the same time. This record \"Filosofem\", which means \"philosopheme\" in Norwegian, is just that. At philosophy. This is genius, and this is art. \"Filosofem\". Suddenly, life has new meaning.\n",
        "\nHave you ever seen a movie or a TV show where a female character hides behind glasses and turtlenecks and whatnot only to have a wardrobe change and a makeover in the third act reveal that, guess what, she was actually a bombshell the whole time? Of course you have. You're clearly not Amish. Anyway, Burzum's debut is that character in album form. What we have here are the makings of some brilliant music that just aren't being allowed to shine like they ought to, partly because of the horrid production, partly because of Varg's lack of experience with recording, and partly due to his habit of dragging his ideas out longer than they need to be.\n\nIf there's anything Varg loves more than making creepy Youtube videos of himself talking about whatever the hell comes to his mind while his young son is either nearby or in his arms, it's atmosphere. The effectiveness of the ambient qualities in Burzum's self-titled debut is quite spotty. Sometimes the atmosphere is brilliantly rendered despite (or maybe even because of) the murky production. \u2018Ea, Lord of the Depths\u2019 is carried on the back of buzzing guitar passages only made more sinister as they marinate in the murky production. 'Black Spell of Destruction', meanwhile, is built on eerie droning that creeps slowly along. Both reek of the sort of foggy, mysterious menace implied by the album\u2019s cover art but not every track is so effective. Opening song \u2018Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\u2019 isn\u2019t very impactful, nor is the dungeon synth interlude \u2018Channeling the Power of Souls into a New God\u2019, which has a mildly mournful tone but doesn\u2019t provide anything noteworthy.\n\nVarg must not have been all that focused or entirely serious in his attempts at making music at this point in his life because there are a few parts where he clearly forgot to even try to inject any of the creepy and/or grandiose atmosphere he's known for. 'War' is the most obvious example of this because this, constituting straightforward Bathory (circa 1984) worship where the simplistic rhythm is accompanied by incoherent yelling. And let\u2019s not forget that laughable bit at the beginning where he says, \u201cThis is war, huh? Wow!\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Varg's occasional inability to realize he needs to move on to the next musical idea whittles away the album\u2019s value as an atmospheric journey. There are a few parts throughout the release that wander without going anywhere or repeat themselves many more times than they need to. The opening track is guilty of this, with a section in the middle that plods onward with a bland, droning texture, the guitars an unengaging buzz of minimal, midpaced activity and the drums just following along without throwing any interesting patterns or fills our way. \u2018A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u2019, meanwhile, is some kind of scientific breakthrough, as the main riff somehow bends spacetime around itself, allowing Varg to cram 45 minutes worth of repetitive droning into roughly nine minutes of actual elapsed time.\n\nBoth the production and the instrumental performances leave quite a bit to be desired. Sure, they manage to create an oppressive atmosphere sometimes but more often, it just makes the album seem rushed and poorly thought out. The drums follow basic patterns that are generally effective at maintaining a song\u2019s momentum but sometimes sound mechanical in their simplicity. The way they\u2019re produced also leaves the cymbals sounding tinny and the snare and toms like drumsticks striking paper bags. The guitars are this album's main strength as far as the instrumental performances go, often having a somber, meditative quality to them as they weave simple, sometimes hypnotic and eerie patterns. When the album speeds up, the guitars shuffle along competently but feel strangely hollow because the tone is so thin. The award for weakest performance goes to Varg's mouth, though. None of the anger or hatred that\u2019s supposed to be there is present. Normally, black metal vocals elicit some kind of cold malevolence but throughout this album, everyone's favorite church arsonist yowls hoarsely and tunelessly and sounds like he\u2019s putting his vocal chords through quite a lot of undue stress.\n\nWhile Varg's talent as a songwriter is certainly here on Burzum's debut, its distribution is uneven and its execution is shoddy, even by TRVE KVLT standards. For every passage as inspired as the energetic and catchy main riff in 'My Journey to the Stars', there seems to be a long-winded mid-paced bit that takes too long to get where it\u2019s going. A good number of the songs switch back and forth between the two, sometimes helped and sometimes hindered by the unholier-than-thou production. The songwriting brilliance that make the three Burzum albums that would follow this one so enjoyable is here but it\u2019s too frequently shoved to the side. This is a decent effort, considering the entire thing is the product of one 19-year-old\u2019s imagination but that 19-year-old, for all his ambition, had yet to master the art of channeling it into something uniformly captivating. Like the young woman in that movie/TV show mentioned in the first paragraph, all the crucial ingredients are already here, but their utilization and presentation just aren't ideal for showing them off.\n",
        "\nIn the list of the many releases I find myself wanting to review and then actually reviewing Daudi Baldrs holds a bit of a special spot, because unlike many others this review was written purely on a Warhammer Fantasy based desire to cover something that sounds like fantasy. Enter Daudi Baldrs, an odd album to come to my mind given that I have more or less a non existent knowledge of dungeon synth and an equally existent care for Burzum in general.\n\nPutting my personal thoughts aside though, this probably could be put up with Megadeth's Risk, Celtic Frost's Prototype and Cold Lake or even St. Anger and Lulu from Metallica for biggest \"what were you guys even thinking\" albums in metal. Though the popular consensus would also state that unlike the aforementioned albums Daudi Baldrs retains artistic integrity due to the circumstances and vision that played into its creation. I honestly am not going to pretend like I know what Varg was thinking when he created this and after 4 or 5 episodes of the Thulean Perspective on YouTube it hits me pretty heavily trying to understand Varg would be a pretty futile task for me since we have two very different ways of thinking and see the world in two very different ways. So if there were to be something I fundamentally have to get to enjoy this album then I'd be a quick hop away from never enjoying this album.\n\nAll that being said, this is not the terrible and awful release its often made out to be, or at least not fully, the potential is here and most of these same ideas can and would be put together again to craft the follow up which I did enjoy. While most complaints on this album boil down to \"it's too basic\" or \"it's not black metal\" my issue is the repetition. I'm not all that concerned that this album could easily be the soundtrack for an 8 bit fantasy game or that the melodies are basic, to the contrary, I quite love that. Doing that same synth melody for 8 minutes straight though like on the very opening track, or all of them, that's where I find myself putting my foot down. At about the 2 minute mark it goes from being moderately enjoyable and quickly devolves into just waiting for the track to end, trying to find something to keep myself occupied rather than just skipping the track altogether because I need to be damn sure the track doesn't pick up halfway through before I write my review. There are two tracks here that can be comfortably sat through for their entirety, go ahead, guess which two, hint, they're the shortest two. And while I do like the melody for Illa Tidandi particularly, it's both pretty and creates a nice sad and tragic atmosphere, but it still suffers from the issue that it's not exactly worth showcasing for an entire 10 minutes. Nothing here needs to be or should be dragged out for as long as it is.\n",
        "\nBurzum's ''The Ways of Yore'' just feels like somewhat of a waste of time. Despite its long length, there's not really that much content on this release. In retrospect, it feels as if the album mostly just consists of digital effects and some percussion. Sure, there are some melodies, some even slightly enjoyable, however they aren't really that interesting or special overall. Most melodies are just boring, bland and overall uninteresting. Most songs just have one simple melody, which plays over and over again for a couple of minutes.\n\nMost of the songs are somewhat indistinguishable from each other. This is largely due to the kettle-boiling sound effect, as I like to call it. Kristian Vikernes adds this weird effect that sounds like a tea kettle boiling, usually to compensate and cover up for his content, or rather lack there off. Whenever he's not using that annoying effect, he usually just strums a chord on an acoustic guitar numerous times, with some percussion in the background. Kristian really does take this simplicity thing way too far, at times it doesn't even sound like music, just noises. \n\nThere are a few enjoyable melodies, for instance ''The Reckoning of Man''. The problem with this song, and a few others, is that it starts out good, with a fairly solid melody, but then it continues for what feels like an eternity. Many songs feel very stretched out, and are thus no longer too enjoyable. The few good melodies are quite nice, though they are somewhat simple, they are still quite interesting, they're usually quite nostalgic and relaxing, and it's obvious that the intent was to make a nostalgic, yet relaxing and atmospheric album.\n\nWhat more is it to the music? I don't know, as no matter how many times I listen, there's such a lack of substance and diversity that I can't really remember anything. There were several instances where I genuinely couldn't tell if the song was just some recycled melodies from earlier songs, as they're barely distinguishable. \n\nFurthermore, the vocals are quite dull. He simply talks quite often, however he does ''sing'' quite a bit. The singing, however, still sounds like talking, as there's no evident passion or effort. But what really annoys me is the talking. Just as the singing, there's no passion or effort, he just talks in the most mundane, monotone and uninteresting manner imaginable. And the lyrics are boring as well, just some pseudo-deep mumbo jumbo that doesn't have any meaning.\n\nOne more thing that I don't get is the swastikas on the cover. It's not really a major aspect, however shouldn't Kristian Vikernes, the man who has become synonymous with racism and white supremacy, refrain from using symbolism heavily correlated to nazism? I know it's a sunwheel, and that it's been used for ages, however there are tons of ancient symbols, so why did he feel the need to chose this particular symbol? Nevertheless, Vikernes did what he did best upon hearing criticism concerning the symbolism; he played victim, talking about how oppressed he is, and how he was a victim of the evil, Jewish media or whatever he believes.\n\nSo what is the conclusion on this clumsily written chaotic review? The content is boring and dull, and comes across as effortless, rushed and uninspired. It might just have been one of the most boring album I've heard in awhile. A whole hour of this is quite unbearable.\n",
        "\nThough Aske was recorded in between Det Som Engang Var and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, it sounds much more primitive. It can be seen as a stylistic regression, returning to the bleak, less dynamic sounds of the debut, but also as an advancement, with the atmosphere becoming darker and more immersive. \n\nThe release begins with \"Stemmen fra taarnet\", a very simple yet effective track. The song begins with a very foreboding fade in, which leads into a fast riff that reminds one of entering the depths of Hell, or maybe going into battle, with a strong sense of impending doom in mind. The chorus, however, is a bleak, melancholic riff that solidifies the atmosphere, bringing the power of the song to new heights. Furthering the atmosphere even more are Varg's shrieks, which have been mixed in such a way that they sound distant, as if they are emanating from the fog created by the music itself. The song relentlessly marches towards a sudden, somewhat startling stop, after which the eerie and unusual \"Dominus Sathanas\" creeps in. This is an instrumental song, and it is mainly there for atmosphere purposes. Beyond the weird sound and cool riffs, there isn't anything remarkable about this song, though it serves an important role on the album.\n\nThe final song is the ten minute epic, \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\". This appeared on Burzum's debut in a raw, demo like form, and Varg, in his dissatisfaction, re-recorded the track on here. It carries the same gripping melancholy as the original, though this has been heavily emphasized by a slower tempo and slightly clearer production. Again, the vocals and production lend a tremendous favor to this song, making it sound much more immersive.\n\nAske is certainly a valuable piece of Norwegian black metal, if you are even remotely interested in the genre, this is definitely something that you should own.\n",
        "\nThis song is just flat out boring. It's just the same three notes played on an acoustic guitar over and over again with some weird, annoying sound effect added. It's clear that he tried to create a hypnotising, atmospheric ambient track, however he failed miserably. The sound effect sounds like a boiling tea kettle, and is both out of place and somewhat annoying. \n\nAdditionally, Varg also talks about some pseudo intellectual bullshit over the ''music'', and the quality is really bad. Not the ''Filosofem'' kind of bad, it's sounds like a horribly compressed recording from the 19th century. Even though he speaks normally, it's often hard to make out what he is saying because of the bad quality.\n\nI wish that there was more that I could write about this single, but I can't. There's just nothing even remotely interesting going on. It's just pointless, it's just a bunch of weird sound effects as well as 3 notes played on a guitar over and over again, with some guy talking. And it goes on for 7 minutes. This song just sounds like some dull, stretched out outro track you'd just put at the end of an album that you wrote in a couple of minutes just to add more length to the album.\n",
        "\nThough I'm a fan of Burzum, I really don't get this album. It's seen as a classic in the black metal community, but no matter how many times I listen to it, I just can't like it. I've heard so much talk about this sounding so ''evil'' and ''dark'', but I frankly can't see it.\n\nThe main problem with this album is the riffs. They're just flat out boring, and every song feels so rushed, weak, and stretched out. Some of the riffs sounds like something I'd write when I was 13 and just barely learned how to play the guitar. There's nothing that stands out. Mostly there's just really bland and overused progressions repeated too many times. This album just feels so pointless, there's absolutely nothing outstanding or even mildly interesting on this album. It almost reminds me of elevator music, it's just so dull.\n\nThe production is quite bad, however what can you expect from Burzum anyway. The guitar tone actually has it's charm, the chainsaw-like distortion is quite effective, though it can sound a bit piercing at times, especially when high notes are tremolo picked, but that isn't to much of a problem, as it mostly consists of chords played quite low on the fretboard. I've been told that this album is an ''anti-death metal album'', and though I can understand that, that single fact doesn't carry the whole album. The fact that this album was unique and different once upon a time doesn't mean that it's good. And though I certainly respect the album for the role it played, that isn't enough for me to actually like it.\n\nThe lyrics aren't too good. It's just some pseudo-intellectual nonsense, however it's tolerable as you can't hear what Varg's saying anyway. And as for the vocals, I do find them quite good, however, this doesn't carry the whole album either. Overall, I understand the historical importance of ''Burzum'', however it's just not very interesting.\n",
        "\nDespite being a less mentioned Burzum album, Det Som Engang Var ranks as my all time favourite. Varg himself described this album simply as a ''follow-up'' to the debut, however this album is so much more than that. The atmosphere and the lyrical themes are way better on this album, and it takes the step towards a more atmosphere driven Burzum. \n\nThe album has a very grey and sad feel to it, and I would describe the album as a manifestation of nostalgia. Just by looking at the album-cover should give you somewhat of an idea of the music; the grey sky, the dead trees, the wandering bloke (also seen on the debut). When listening, you feel as if you are that guy, wandering aimlessly through sad and empty nothingness.\n\nThe drumming on the album also reflects the atmosphere, rather than constantly using blast beats, he keeps the drum beat simple for most of the album. And when blast beats actually are used, it is way more impactful. The guitar tone is great, highly distorted and muddy. But behind the deceiving tone are fantastic melodies, in the form of simple, yet very effective riffs. There's less tremolo-picking, and more chords, and let ring, and the overall tempo is slower. Varg also uses hums, which really adds to the atmosphere. A great example of this is ''En ring til \u00e5 herske'', which is the best song on the album.\n\nEvery song on this album feels like a journey, rather than using repetition, as he does in the later Burzum albums, there is a natural progression in each of the songs. At no point do you get bored during this album, in fact, the album is over before you know it, and I often find myself playing the album on repeat. This album is great for those just starting listening to black metal, as well as long time black metal fans (who somehow hasn't listened to this already). The only negative thing I can say about this album is that it is only 40 minutes long.\n",
        "\nUnlike certain murder-associated black metal acts I could name, Varg has had enough good ideas to produce something that could justify the mystique. Filosofem is his best effort: a strange slice of atmospheric black metal and brooding synth work whose coherence arises from its hypnotic, hazy ambience. \n\nThe album begins with the dreamy \"Dunkelheit\" (known on some editions as \"Burzum\"), which sets the tone for the record as a whole as well as doing it best: representing the album's template well, synth notes fall like raindrops into a pond over the chainsaw buzz of guitar work. On this song, the black metal genre itself delivers on its promise of catharsis through the exploration of bleak and depressive emotional states: precisely because it is subtle, it is capable of stirring an intense reaction. Varg's vocals and lyrics are rightly sparse -- though by no means bad or distracting; they simply are not what drive the music, and he is wise enough as a musician to let them take a back seat. \n\nThe songs of Filosofem, including \"Dunkelheit,\" can be repetitive, and all could afford to have had 1-2 minutes shaved off of their run time. But they avoid becoming dull because Varg deftly embraces the hypnotic character of his musical approach. Nowhere is this more evident than on the divisive, odd, and unique 25-minute centerpiece (by run-time), \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte,\" a completely synth-driven, dreamy, delirious whirlpool of a dark ambient track. It has absolutely nothing to do with black metal and is best appreciated as powerful meditative or contemplative music.\n\nNothing else on the record reaches the heights of these two tracks -- and even on their own, those are worth the price of admission -- but they sometimes come close: the icy \"Jesu d\u00f8d,\" which features some of the best drum work on the album, is another highlight. But at other times, the remaining tracks do nothing but revisit old territory only to uncover inferior results, like the plodding \"Decrepitude II,\" which tries and fails to evoke the same mystique as \"Dunkelheit.\"\n\nI must give highest honors to the cover of this album, which manages to perfectly capture the atmosphere, with its hazy, earthy coloring and evocative imagery. This is one of those delightful albums in which the album art enhances the listening experience.\n\nAfter a decade of listening to Filosofem, I still find myself returning to it at least once a year, and that has to say something. While far from being a masterpiece, it is must-listening for black metal fans and a strong, representative slice of the genre for outsiders.\n",
        "\nWith the single release of Thulean Mysteries, Varg continues on his path of ambient exploration and progression. A progression because, since Varg's return, his ambient releases have taken us down a road of apparent refined maturity and evolution. \n\nThough, Daudi Baldrs and Hiloskjalf were not well regarded releases, I like them a lot and as some of the reviewers on the site have mentioned, I feel they are very much in the black metal vein - check out the title track of Daudi Baldrs for instance. Varg's newest ambient music is not anything like his earlier stuff though. It seems he has ditched the overall black metal compositional quality in favor of a natural, earthy, mythological sound. There's no doubt that the mythological quality is very much an important asset of Norwegian black metal and specifically of Burzum's image but this music reflects not so much the battle-ready image of warring vikings but of a spiritual encounter with our ancient fore-bearers; a return and visit with ancient ideals and knowledge. \n\nThis makes perfect sense because it is something Varg has dedicated himself to in the last 6 years or so since he has returned to music - with his blog, aptly titled Thulean Perspective, his books and his RPG. For someone who is only casually interested in Varg, this music makes no sense and it can sound a little uninspired. But for the people who take Varg seriously it fits in well with his preachings on Blood & Soil and a return to the hunter-gatherer way of life. \n\nI for one lie somewhere in the middle as Burzum listeners go (I am not dedicated, but I do listen to the majority of his work). I think Varg's overall push to return to a natural mode of living, a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and to seek knowledge from our ancient Nordic ancestors is convincing and is a valid objective. On the other hand, I do think Varg takes himself a little too seriously and kind of thinks everything he says is gospel.\n\nI like this track a lot and as I said it fits well into this neverending quest to gain knowledge from our Nordic ancestors. It's a spiritual piece, a good one, that leaves the listener wanting more. The only problem is the full-length efforts of this nature by Varg have been a little meandering and uninspired, at best. What we need is something right in the middle of this single and his most recent ambient full-lengths. There's no doubt Varg is on a mission and he has a vision and at the least, he's convincing and enthusiastic about it.\n",
        "\nPerhaps you agree that Varg Vikernes has a lot of facets. This polarising maverick spreads fairly crude ideologies for whatever reasons, his criminal past casts a shadow on his frame of mind, he has remained unbroken after 16 years in prison and, last but not least, he seems to be an intelligent guy. It comes therefore as no surprise that his project Burzum shows a lot of facets as well. There is this ambient material which appears pretty meaningless, at least from my point of view. Burzum also has released many \"normal\" black metal tracks. It may sound blasphemous in the ears of some fanatics, but I don't think that the eponymous full-length or \"Det som engang var\" are outstanding works, apart from perhaps their early date of creation. Nevertheless, Burzum is definitely among those bands whose music I do not want to miss, because, and that's the third facet of Varg's musical output, he has also written a handful of tracks that are simply unforgettable. They touch the listener's innermost. The prime example of this facet is featured on \"Hvis lyset tar oss\".\n\nOf course, I am talking of the opener, the delayed title track of \"Det som engang var\". From the first moment, it embraces the listener with its wintery coldness and leads the audience into the deepest Norwegian forests. Yet the atmosphere is only one of the outstanding features of this monumental track. Without an iota of extravaganza, the song develops in an incredible manner. It takes five minutes until the first passionate screams of Varg occur and this instrumental part alone is able to make you think of converting to Odinism, naturalism or any other -ism that is aligned with the artists way of thinking. The icy lines are almost painfully simple, yet there can be no doubt that Varg exactly wanted to create these primitive melodies. Doubtlessly, \"Det som engang var\" can be used for the demonstration of the power of exactly defined and mercilessly consistent lines that fail to offer any form of complexity. I am sure, the result of this demonstration will surprise a lot of people, not only because of the hypnotic effect of the constantly repeated sequence of tones. The more or less philosophical lyrics coalesce with the music in an excellent manner - and the overall picture is perfect. If somebody wants to know how expressive Norwegian black metal can be, he just has to listen to this piece. By the way, he will also experience how impressive it can be.\n\nYet Varg does not deliver a uniform album. He takes the liberty to present the whole spectrum of his creativity. Hence the last track lives up to its name. The ambient \"Tomhet\" offers nothing else but emptiness, its fragile keyboard lines and the stoic background sounds create a soft yet ice-cold atmosphere. It's like watching the first sun rays on a Norwegian winter morning. Perhaps you have already noticed that I am not a specialist for ambient sounds. Despite or exactly because of my ignorance, I assume that it is a good ambient number. But sorry, I do not intend to broaden my musical horizon. One song of this kind is okay, 14 minutes of these sounds are a little bit too long. Anyhow, the track falls under the category \"acceptable\", not at least in view of its break after seven minutes that opens a new perspective. Let's get back to the sounds with whom I am more familiar. The title track mirrors the furious facet of Burzum. One might make a grimace and say that the monotonous song does not shine with any surprising twists and turns. My answer is: in sharp contrast to monogamy, monotony can be bliss. Intensive riffing, a sufficient degree of minimalist variations and another perfect vocal performance form a monolithic entity. The last track is another black metal sledgehammer. Its formula is similar to that of \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" (the song) and the vocals stay on track, but the somewhat bulky riffing fails to generate stirring lines. \n\nAll in all, it seems as if our tradition-conscious fellow (or \"the asshole from Norway\", please choose your side right now) has bundled three EPs on this album. 15 minutes of coldness meet 15 minutes of fury and 15 minutes of ambient sounds. One might think that this constellation prevents an homogeneous overall appearance. Yet the three components have one thing in common: Varg surprises with an extremely intoxicating form of aesthetics. With the exception of \"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\", the tracks have a very special aura. Varg, the murderer from Norway, is a romantic, at least in terms of black metal. This irritating contradiction lends the album its more or less unique aroma. The cover, painted by Theodor Kittelsen, another (neo-) romantic artist, closes the circle. Even more than 20 years after its release, I am still fascinated by \"Hvis lyset tar oss\". Although the musical content is, in my humble opinion, not totally flawless, I think that every black metal fan must know this overwhelming work. Come and walk with Vikernes the fine line between genius and insanity.\n",
        "\n'Hvis lyset tar oss' was the album that saw Burzum hit its peak and is Varg Vikernes' first true masterpiece. Compared to the first couple of albums, Vikernes' conceptual ideas of Burzum seem to have fleshed out properly on 'Hvis lyset tar oss'. With a minimalistic approach, the content of this record is of a slightly more repetitive nature than previously, and in comparison to Emperor's 'In the Nightside Eclipse', also released in 1994, this album is dead simple. What this album lacks in raw technical finesse, it makes up with unmatched atmosphere.\n\nThe obvious highlights are the tracks that start and finish the album. Epic opener \"Det som en gang var\" is a 14 minute, synth-driven beast. It starts with a hauntingly beautiful and melancholic intro, with the synth clearly dominating over the guitars. After a lengthy piece of guitar-riffing, the six stringers take the back-seat again and the synth and vocals steal the spotlight. Over the course of the 14 minutes the song runs for, it progresses from a soothing-like quality, to a bit more menacing one, and without following a \"pop structure\", the song flows well and feels much shorter than it is.\n\n\"Tomhet\", like \"Det som en gang var\", is also a 14 minute track. But this isn't a metal track at all. This is a purely ambient track that concludes 'Hvis lyset tar oss' in a wonderfully soothing way. If you ever played Donkey Kong on the Super Nintendo, you'll have a rough idea of what this ambient tune will sound like. It's very melancholic in nature and washes you in nostalgia, opening your mind to memories of old that seem to be magical compared to the present. As silly as that may sound, considering this is music by the infamous Varg Vikernes, it's definitely got a close resemblance to certain levels in Donkey Kong, where you venture into mysterious and unexplored caves full of danger.\n\nSandwiched between these two epics are the two shorter, and slightly more conventional tracks of the album. Both the title-track and \"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\" are typical guitar- and blast beat-driven black metal songs that soar their way from start to finish. The heavy use of dominating synth has taken the backseat in this case, and lets the bread-and-butter metal instruments take the spotlight a bit, with the latter one utilizing the synth very well and sparingly.\n\n'Hvis lyset tar oss' could in many ways be considered an anthem for the Norwegian black metal scene, as it has a bit of everything in it. It's epic and dramatic, fast and furious, but also soul-cleansing and magical. What became a norm in black metal after 1994, was the use of synth to create a more mysterious, fantasy RPG-like atmosphere - and whether Varg Vikernes was the first one to do this is probably debatable - but he was definitely the first to master it and one of the inventors of the fantasy RPG-inspired black metal music.\n",
        "\nIt seemed that after he was released from prison, Mr. Varg Vikernes decided to, in a way, reinvent the black metal style he was producing before his ass was \"thrown into tha slamma\". \"Belus\" was his first album to be released in 11 years and marks a return to the black metal style, although whether or not Varg would attest to this is debatable. While it sounds like a black metal album for sure, there are some huge differences between this and anything he put out from 1992 to 1996. Still, it sounds somewhat closer to his self-titled album than it does to \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" or \"Filosofem.\"\n\nOne thing that's instantly noticeable is the complete lack of keyboards. Prior to this, Burzum was incorporating a lot of ambiance into his records, especially the two purely ambient prison-era albums. \"Belus\" is a completely guitar-drive affair. I'm not sure if this works in favor of the album but it's definitely something interesting considering it bears a Burzum logo. From \"Det som engang var\" to \"Filosofem\", Burzum really implemented far more keyboards than before, specifically on the latter two albums. This really added a much more ambient sound to the already atmospheric music. I guess I can understand why Varg would want to make a purely metal album lacking keyboards after not being allowed to use a guitar for so damn long, as his two dark ambient prison albums are evident examples of this. \n\nSo no keyboards at all? Correct. This is as guitar-driven as Burzum ever got. I wouldn't say this is the \"most black metal\" album he ever made, though. There still is ambience on here but instead of keyboards, it comes from the droning, buzzsaw sound of the guitars. Tracks like the melodic, hypnotic, repetitive \"Glemselens elv\" is a prime example of ambient black metal, without the keyboards. Really the same can be said for any of these songs but this 12-minute monster really exemplifies this. \"Belus' d\u00f8d\" has a riff that is actually borrowed from the \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" album, specifically the title track from that disc. It sounds so much better on a guitar. It's very dark and haunting, although the atmosphere overall of this album seems to be one that radiates light over darkness. The cover art really works well with this because it's almost as if Varg is leaving a dark, shadowy forest and entering a field of sunlight and brightness. \"Sverddans\" is a track that was apparently written during Varg's death metal days and was finally recorded for this album. It's a faster song that contains an interesting solo, if a bit simple, but definitely has a death metal influence thrown into it. \n\nVarg's vocals on here are somewhat similar to those he was preforming on \"Felosofem\". It's not a high-pitched shriek anymore but rather a raspy whisper-like scream. He has made far greater use of clean vocals this time around, though not as many as he would implement on the next album \"Fallen\". \"Kaimadalthas' nedstigning\" is a great example of this with it's clean, spoken word chorus and an eventual chant-like singing style. This song sounds a bit interesting how it constantly changes from fast-paced black metal to a more melodic song, especially during the breaks. There is also something that resembles a solo in this song although it's highly distorted. Hell, the guitars here are completely distorted and that produces an extremely fuzzy atmosphere that may be a bit hard to digest. Either way, the atmosphere sounds pretty good, if highly droning.\n\nThis was a good return to black metal for Varg. Gotta give the guy credit, seeing as he was in prison up until two years before this album's release. It may lack the amazing keyboard ambience and substitutes it for a more guitar-driven ambience, but it's still a solid black metal album from an icon within the genre. He'd improve on the next one, for sure.\n",
        "\n\"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" was Burzum's first album after Varg Vikernes was imprisoned for the arson of multiple churches and the murder of fellow musician Euronymous. Because he was only allowed limited access to a synth while in jail, he recorded two dark ambient albums, this being the first released in 1997 and the other being \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\" released in 1999. This was actually one of the first albums of Burzum I ever listened to many years ago. Upon my many listens to this album, I really enjoyed it at first. Unfortunately, this has ended up being my least favorite Burzum album and it lost its charm to my ears. There is some good buried in here but its overshadowed by the mediocrity and overall boring and lackluster music.\n\nSo this is a purely dark ambient album. There are no guitars, drums, or vocals. This record is completely instrumental. I don't have an issue with instrumental music at all and I even have my own dark ambient/noise music project. In fact, I prefer my ambient music to be instrumental. The issue I have with this is, ironically, how repetitive the music gets. I also enjoy repetitive ambient music, and black metal for that matter. But when you take one single keyboard note and play it over and over for 10 and a half minutes, it tends to get very old very fast and loses its charm. This is exactly the case with \"Illa ti\u00f0andi\". Thing is, the note is actually quite beautiful and sad, if quite simplistic and primitive. Varg would have been able to save the song had he changed it up a few times at least but unfortunately, he does not, and it fades into oblivion. The title track also follows the same exact structure throughout its nearly 9-minute runtime. It's not a bad sound and the notes sound really eerie and dark but they definitely overstay their welcome. The same can be said about \"B\u00e1lfer\u00f0 Baldrs\" which actually takes its main key segment from one of the riffs in \"Jesus' Tod\" from the \"Filosofem\" album. Great song but here, it just doesn't work favorably. \n\nI really can't say much more about this album aside from the fact that it really serves no purpose, whatsoever. Sure, it has an interesting musical concept dealing with the story of the Norse god Baldr, acting as a sort of instrumental scripture, but the concept is all it really has going for itself. The music is just bland and uninspired and to this day, I still try to listen to it for the feeling I used to get. I used to really enjoy this but now, I'm sorry to say this record has been spun one time too many. Thankfully, Varg's next album \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\" is quite better and an overall solid ambient album.\n",
        "\nBurzum is arguably the most important band to come out of the infamous second-wave of black metal in Norway. After releasing his debut full-length self-titled album the year prior as well as the infamous \"Aske\" EP earlier in the year, Varg Vikernes released his second offering \"Det som engang var\" in 1993. His self-titled debut as well as the \"Aske\" EP are both extremely great albums and, without a doubt, two of the most essential albums to listen to for any black metal fanatic. However, with this album, Varg treads even further into a darker, more ambient-injected sound. He has not reached the pinnacle sound of \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" yet at this point but this is a great precursor to that album. Hell, even the intro track from \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" takes its name from the title of this album!\n\nMusically speaking, this album is still fairly similar to the sound of the first full-length but a bit more mature, focused, and controlled. The atmosphere is also far greater this time around. Adding more keyboard segments with folky interludes and a focus on dark ambient music, Varg had essentially created the \"ambient black metal\" subgenre with this disc. The guitars are still extremely prominent and ear-piercing with some of the finest Burzum riffs in history but with ambient pieces such as the intro track, this album is definitely able to be easily separated from the first. \"Han som reiste\" is probably the greatest ambient piece on this album. It translates to \"The One Who Wandered\" and even the title of this song gives its sound and atmosphere great justice. It's almost poetic while containing no lyrics. The ambience certainly has been stepped up on this album but the guitars still remain the driving force.\n\n\"Key to the Gate\" is the album's first metal track. It starts off sounding fairly chaotic with a faster paced riff accompanied by a blast beat. However, it is when this song slows down a bit where things start sounding amazing. The melodic riffing in this song is some of the best on the entire album and there is a guitar solo that sounds absolutely magnificent, even if it is not too complex. In fact I dare say this solo and these riffs are among the finest Varg has ever written. This song is probably my favorite of the metal tracks on the album. \"En ring til aa herske\" starts off at a slower pace and has an atmosphere that would likely sound breathtaking whilst listening on the top of a mountain in the midst of a blizzard. Aside from \"Key to the Gate\", \"Lost Wisdom\" is probably the second most well-known song on this album. It is one of two songs with English lyrics and has an instantly recognizable riff that almost sounds \"bouncy\" in nature. It's not as impressive as \"Key to the Gate\" but is still a great song and has been covered by many bands over the years.\n\nVarg's vocals on this album are the same that he has been doing on all of his recordings at this point and the same style that would eventually carry over on to \"Hvis lyset tar oss\". He utilizes a high-pitch scream that has since been adopted by a countless number of the depressive suicidal black metal bands over the years. One thing that must be noted is at this time, these vocals were extremely unique in the black metal genre and not many bands had used this style. Burzum had to have been the first band to really do this. His vocals sound tormented and absolutely agonizing and this really helps move the album forward in a positive manner. \n\nSo, with \"Det som engang var\", Varg had began to really enhance the ambience within Burzum's music. He would greatly multiply this sound for the band's next album \"Hvis lyset tar oss\", which I consider the absolute best black metal album ever recorded. This album may not be on that magnitude of atmosphere and overall greatness but it is still a fantastic, essential piece of Norwegian black metal that has been adored by many fans of the genre and will continue to be a must-listen for tans of the band.\n",
        "\nAlmost as infamous as Varg Vikernes' murder of Euronymous, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs has been a polarizing album since its 1997 release. Abandoning (or being forced to abandon, rather) the raging electric guitars and the thundering drums he'd used earlier in his career, Varg dives headfirst into the atmospheric ambitions the last 30 minutes of Burzum's previous album, Filosofem first introduced listeners to. People love to argue about whether this is a masterfully atmospheric journey or a repetitive borefest. I find myself in the latter camp, though I can't outright decry this album. It may be tiresome in its repetition, but there's still some inspired songcraft to be found in certain parts of this journey. \n\nVarg is owed quite a bit of credit for certain aspects of this album that turned out far better than detractors would like to admit. The main thing that is beautifully communicated through most of this album is the emotional tone from each part of the story told in the liner notes. Usually people go into this album expecting it to sound horrible because it was played on a cheap synthesizer but Varg squeezes a lot of value out of the machine's limited capabilities. Sure, the low quality of its tone can be a bit distracting but music is more about the skill of the writers and performers than the instruments they use. With that in mind, slipping into the mythic world that inspired this album, with the narrative liner notes to guide you, is surprisingly easy. Varg crafted some truly evocative melodies that, at least for a time, make you forget that they're being played on a crummy instrument. Some of these numbers sound like menu music from a Super Nintendo-era RPG but a few of them deliver timeless medieval melodies that transport you to Varg's fantasy world. For this reason, the best way to listen to this album is while reading the story. When you do this, the notes and chord progressions take on new meaning. The title track becomes enthralling with its doom-foretelling main motif and 'Hermo\u00f0r \u00e1 Helfer\u00f0', with its folk-derived ditty conveying a hopeful optimism, is a great audio companion to the retelling of the ride Hermo\u00f0r takes to Hel in an attempt to bring Baldr back. Every song here, at the very least, does something to tonally create a mood that fits with the story. \n\nWith some genuinely deft, if minimalistic, writing at the heart of Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, what went so horribly wrong? Well, the minimalism that was welcome as far as composing rhythms was concerned slipped its way into Varg's method of structuring the album. Each song only has a maximum of three ideas, which, when half of these numbers exceed the eight-minute mark, isn't enough. Worse, the songs don't have an interesting way of presenting these ideas. They just places them in a revolving door without allowing one to build or flow naturally into the next. First there's Melody 1, then Melody 2, then maybe Melody 3. Then the cycle starts again. 'Illa ti\u00f0andi' isn't even kind enough to give us that. This piece is just one extremely basic pattern played over and over again for 10 minutes, sometimes accompanied by a synth effect that sounds like a mournful choir, sometimes not. Even the title track, the only lengthy number here that satisfies, is just an endless cycle of the same few motifs, wearing out its welcome a couple minutes before it's over. \n\nIf the Internet is to be believed, a lot of people don't understand this album, which I assume means they just don't appreciate atmospheric music, especially coming from a black metal innovator like the Vargster. The idea of someone failing to comprehend these songs on their own terms is baffling because, with all the parts on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs that are practically copied and pasted ad nauseum, I understand it too easily. Without buildup or nuanced interactions between the different elements at play, there's not much to discover. The best albums, regardless of genre, contain elements that are well thought-out and meaningful but not necessarily obvious at first glace. Finding them during a third or fourth listen lends them depth that make them better. This album has little of that. Varg's always been one of the more repititious of the Norwegian black metal composers but his stuff before this had some spark. Here, he sounds bored (which he probably was because he was in prison). While some initial inspiration can be heard in some of this album's stronger and more emotive melodies, that ambition sadly didn't carry over to the way everything was laid out, allowing almost every song to devolve into a bland and lifeless journey through an endlessly repeating hallway in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.\n",
        "\nSome guys just can't figure out alone when it's time to say goodbye, bring some gluten free butter flavored cookies to the office, mumble a boringly predictable retirement speech during lunchtime, sign the necessary documents in human resources and prepare for the most ambitious time in their life: retirement!\n\nUpon listening to this track, I couldn't stop thinking: what's wrong with this guy? 'Euronymous' is dead a long time ago, no one cares about being 'trve' anymore and \"dear Lord, when will it end?!\".\n\n'Mythic Dawn' is a repetitive, droning segment of distorted guitar's strums, which will painfully waste your time. There is nothing slightly atmospheric in this track, just a buzzing cheap guitar with a continuing bass drum once in two seconds. After half a minute I thought \"ok...I got this, now I hope he can introduce some creative elements before I lose my frigging mind\"...but he didn't. And there I was, deserted and alone, wondering why I'm even listening to this utterly pointless repetitive crap instead of doing anything else, while my sanity slowly began to fade away.\n\nIn conclusion: if the idea of hearing the same monotonous riff over and over again for five minutes sounds like a favorable activity for you and you are a self hating masochist, this track could satisfy all your needs!\n",
        "\nMy review score for this album does not reflect my enjoyment of the music or the objective musical talents of the composer, but the average of those factors combined with the presentation of ideas in the album. As such, my score can be broken down into two parts:\nMusical quality: 70%\nConcept, ideas, and organization: 100%\n\nBack in the day, when I was still a Literature student at university, there was a module offered by my department that focused on the writing of the Anglo-Saxons in England. The module covered some prose accounts, short poems, and longer, epic poems, the most famous of which was 'Beowulf'. Students examined these works both in modern translation and, after a brief process of learning the language, in the original Old English that had been used between about 400-1100AD. Difficult as it was to analyze some of those buried works (many existed only through one copy and several of those copies were irreparably damaged), it was both stimulating and wondrous to become involved in the events and tellings of the age, and perhaps more so because of the obscurity of the texts we were trying to decipher and resurrect, since they afforded only glimpses of stories and snatches of poetry instead of the complete and overwhelming experience of modern books. Yet, precisely because one had to scrutinize minutely and work for every scrap of meaning, it meant that the rewards and imaginative license those texts gave were all the more captivating, alluring the mind by providing only a partial picture, which the mind's eye was left to complete or contemplate, depending on the strength of imagination.\n\nBurzum's 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' is exactly like that. The building blocks of this album are unquestionably simple and would appear to have some rather obvious omissions, but that simplicity and fragmentary nature can also be part of its charm if one is prepared to work hard in exploring both what is there and is not there. It is rare in black metal, or in music, or in art generally for any work to be quite so focused and fixated as this, since art usually works on the principle of being interesting or attracting attention before it attempts to unload any greater significance upon the observer. What makes 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' a difficult album to judge is that it would appear that it begins with concepts in hand and, instead of attempting to build on those concepts or to flesh them out, they are presented starkly and without almost any supporting content. In strictly musical terms, the songs are plain, repetitive, and uncomplicated. However, in artistic terms, the music would seem to be a direct manifestation (or as direct a manifestation as possible) of those ideas into aural form. The album is thus similar in many ways to the writings of the Anglo-Saxons, since their works often consisted of blunt bursts of direct meaning that combined to form an overall picture, the impression of which was the macrocosm of all those small phrases.\n\nIf one attempts to find the theme or idea or philosophy behind the album, one looks at the music, the lyrics, the song titles, and the artwork and - as far as I can see - comes to the conclusion that 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' is about the quest for meaning and significance, though also perfectly encapsulates the message that there only exists an absence of meaning and significance. Just listen to the vast swells of void in the title track as that two-note movement rolls up and down or the literal interrogation of emptiness in 'Tomhet', so named because the song represents that hollowness inside words, inside the self, that cannot be filled. Read the lyrics to 'Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen' that are saturated with impotent images and the desperate grasp for understanding, but concede only the ending of the search, not the success of finding. The album title, and particularly the title of the opening song, are incomplete phrases, hinting at revelatory meaning though in fact leaving a yawning chasm of sorrow where that open door of signification cannot be closed. What happens \"if the light takes us\"? What does it take us to? What does it take from us? Then the haunting conclusion of 'Det Som En Gang Var' ('What Once Was'): \"Vi d\u00f8de ikke.../Vi har aldri levd\" (\"We are not dead.../We have never lived\") forces home the tragic, horrible senselessness of existence that we do not realize, since we are forever seeking our meaning in the what has come before. Burzum, like the Anglo-Saxons, always looks to the past for help in revealing the present, while those from the past looked to the past too...\n\nThe moods and shapes of the album make it seem like a concept album, or at least an album linked by a single train of thought. From the grandeur and comparative spectacle of the opening song, through the ominous churn of the title track, through the ugly dissonance of 'Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen', and towards the catatonic calm of 'Tomhet', the struggle for meaning seems to intensify, climax, and be accepted as futile. The opening 'Det Som En Gang Var' contains the pick of the musical parts, with its aged loftiness communicated by means of the repeated synthesizer parts, while 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' is all brooding thunderstorm and dual-paced oppression, the riffs and keyboards working counter to one another in both pace and mood. The most \"difficult\" song on the album has always been 'Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen', though it is probably the most typical piece on here: despite the dreadful dissonance of the opening riff and blastbeats, it wrestles with its own awkwardness, fading out in a burst of melody like the last sunset of a dying age. 'Tomhet' has already been discussed at length and is musically rewarding and a calming, though no more optimistic, conclusion of the album's themes.\n\nThough suited well to the ideas and philosophy of the album, the music is only worthwhile if one is fully invested in the pursuit of understanding, since there is little in the way of naturally enjoyable content to be gleaned from the songs here. The playing is neither complex nor catchy, succeeding more by its indistinctness than any positive quality. Atmosphere is of course present in abundance, though the real quality of this release is to be found in its immersiveness and utter, unwavering focus on conveying a single idea, which - because of the nature of that idea - it finds itself incapable of doing more than hinting at. The reason why so many people have proclaimed this album genius or awarded it a perfect score is because one cannot separate the content and the context, so they have concluded that it is as \"true\" as possible - an absolute statement of undeniable fact. Whatever the musical imperfections of 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss', I agree that it is a near-flawness construction of art, but on musical quality alone actually leaves a great deal to be desired. It is certainly not my favourite album to listen to, nor my favourite Burzum album, but it is objectively the greatest Burzum album purely due to the fact that it never falters in its execution. However, it cannot be listened to as merely music, but must be left open for exploration, of which I still have much more to do.\n",
        "\nWhile Burzum's debut focused on the more traditional approach to black metal used by bands such as Mayhem, Det Som Engang Var is a black metal album featuring Varg's own approach to music- long, drawn out songs to create atmosphere.\n\nAfter the short noise intro, \"Den Onde Kyste\", ends, some signs of an improved sound begin. \"Key to the Gate\" is the first real song on Det Som Engang Var. It contains several contrasting sections, ranging from evil dissonance to beautiful melody. It's guitar solo is an obvious improvement from the faster, less refined solos on Burzum's first album.\n\nThe songs on Det Som Engang Var are more repetitive than on the debut. I actually say this in a good way, as Varg's brand of repetition never gets boring, and it creates a cryptic, dark atmosphere. \"En Ring Til Aa Herske\" is a rather heavy piece, using a slow, repetitive riff to create an almost hypnotic sound. It then progresses into a quite beautiful arpeggiated section. This writing style would be employed to a greater extent on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, and to an even greater extent on Filosofem, as Varg made atmosphere an even greater priority.\n\nIn some ways, Det Som Engang Var is actually more aggressive than the debut. While it is far more refined, it is full of heavy riffs. The aforementioned \"En Ring Til Aa Herske\", the rather catchy \"Lost Wisdom\", and \"Key to the Gate\" all feature very heavy sections. At the time, this was black metal's heaviest album. The blastbeat technique is employed much less here, giving more room for complexity. Songs like the nine minute epic, \"Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn\", employ blastbeats. Because they are used less, when they are used, they sound much more intense due to the contrast. Also, better production should be noted. This increase in production value also makes the blastbeats sound like more than just clicking in the background. Everything here \"comes alive\" so to speak.\n\nSome of the most beautiful music on Det Som Engang Var happens to be ambient. \"Han Som Reiste\" is the main ambient song on here. While it is more straightforward than \"Channeling the Power of Souls into a New God\" from the debut, it is a better song in its more creative compilation. There is also an equivalent to \"Dungene of Darkness\" here, the last track, \"Svarte Troner\". \"Naar Himmelen Klarner\" is ambient in some respects, but it is closer to black metal. It is just like \"The Crying Orc\" from the first album, but a bit longer, and not as good in my opinion. It is a bit less melancholic, and I think that the melancholy is what made \"The Crying Orc\" such a beautiful compositions.\n\nDet Som Engang Var seems to be Varg's first attempt at creating a perfect album. While it is perfect in my opinion, I removed one percent mark because it is not Burzum's best. Varg went above and beyond with Fliosofem, making his best. If you are debating about which Burzum album to buy first, I would say that you can't go wrong with Det Som Engang Var.\n",
        "\nWith a one man band like Burzum, the only member ending up in prison for murder would make one think that the band would be over, but miraculously, this was not the case with Burzum. Varg was able to release two full albums over the course of his sixteen years of imprisonment. The two albums he produced were this album (Daudi Baldrs), and Hiloskjalf. They both consist of only synthetic material.\n\nWhile Hiloskjalf would be the textbook definition of dark ambient, Daudi Baldrs actually consists of what one could call \"synthetic black metal\". Compositionally, the music here is black metal. The only difference is that it is synthetic, meaning it is purely synthesizer based.\n\nThe opening track, \"Daudi Baldrs\" is a suspenseful composition. It is fairly well written, and has no real compositional flaws other than a dragging feeling that actually isn't too bad. The use of a cheap horn sound in the place of a rhythm guitar is what makes this song feel a bit off. But Varg was in prison during the recording of this, so he really didn't have access to an extensive array of equipment.\n\nMost of the music on Daudi Baldrs is string based, using horn like sounds to create a dark wall of atmosphere. There are a few deviations from this formula. The second track of the album, \"Hermo\u00f0r \u00e1 Helfer\u00f0\" features some plucked string sounds. A few tracks also have bells in them, which serve little purpose other than to make the album seem more complete.\n\nTwo songs, \"B\u00e1lfer\u00f0 Baldrs\" and \"Illa ti\u00f0andi\", are actually rerecordings of two Filosofem songs, \"Jesus Tod\" and \"Gebrechlichkeit I\", respectively. \"Illa ti\u00f0andi\" is my personal favorite on Daudi Baldrs. It features the same great composition as its Filosofem counterpart, but it is a little less interesting due to the lack of distortion and incoherence. That is what made the songs on Filosofem so special.\n\nVarg Vikernes put forth a great amount of effort when recording Daudi Baldrs. He composed each song quite carefully. He added a few interesting parts to the two rerecordings to make them a bit original, as it would be a bit of a ripoff to release the same material again. Sadly, even with all of this effort put forth, this does not join the ranks of such albums as Filosofem and the debut. Possibly, if the traditional metal setup of guitars, bass, drums, and vocals were used, this could join those ranks. It's not that I have an issue with ambient, it's just that very cheesy sounds were used here. As previously mentioned, cheap horn sounds take the place of a rhythm guitar at some points. The orchestral strings are great sounding at first, but because of their simplicity, they can get a little tiring for the listener.\n\nOther than a few flaws that Varg really had no control over, Daudi Baldrs is a good album. It is just lacking when it is compared to the rest of Burzum's discography.\n",
        "\nWhile better known for his more mature later efforts such as Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem (and the murder of Euronymous), Varg has some great early releases, such as this album, Aske, and Det Som Engang Var. Burzum's self titled debut may come off as a relatively immature album, it has nearly as much depth to it as an album such as Filosofem.\n\nBurzum's later material consists of longer songs, with one longer than twenty five minutes. In a bit of a contrast, this album has mostly shorter songs. \"War\" is an almost thrash metal like song that clocks in at only two and a half minutes. This shows that the album is a more straightforward black metal album than Burzum's later album.\n\nThe music on \"Burzum\" is overwhelmingly beautiful. \"The Crying Orc\" is a rather sad short instrumental, consisting of only guitar. It is one of Varg's most beautiful compositions. Other songs rely on an approach designed to evoke thought rather than emotion. \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\" is a poetic song that requires a lot of thinking. The mysterious atmosphere of the track is unbelievable. Still, there are some aggressive songs. The aforementioned \"War\" is one of the most aggressive songs to ever be written by Varg. \n\nA Burzum album would not be complete without some ambient music. While the black metal provides a huge amount of atmosphere, the ambient music adds a slightly different edge to the music. \"Channeling the Power of Souls into a New God\" is an absolutely beautiful ambient piece, and a true standout. \"Dungeons of Darkness\" is the other ambient piece. It takes a very different approach to creating a dark atmosphere. Instead of using only synthesizers, it makes use of a \"guest appearance\" from Euronymous, who also played at least one of the solos on \"War\". On \"Dungeons of Darkness\", Euronymous is banging on a gong in the background, creating a very interesting sound. This sound is very haunting, even though it is not an \"in your face\" song, it still drifts in your head in an odd way.\n\nOne of the first things that someone listening to \"Burzum\" will notice is the vocals. Varg Vikernes shrieks in an almost wolflike way. Songs like the eerie \"Spell of Destruction\" feature excellent shrieks. \"Spell of Destruction\" comes to a strange part where there are only guitars and screamed vocals. That is one of the best moments of the entire album.\n\nThe one song that I think is a bit below the rest of the album is \"My Journey to the Stars\". It is a good song, but it lacks the same atmosphere as the rest of \"Burzum\". Instead of putting the listener in a dark forest, they find themselves drifting through space. Varg claims that the song is symbolic, so it most likely has a deeper meaning than floating into space. One could say the same thing about \"War\", though. I like the song, because it is almost a break from the more serious stuff. While serious in its own respect, the song is quite fun to listen to.\n\n\"Burzum\" is an eight track album, but it still feels like it could be longer. To remedy this problem, many versions come with a bonus Aske E.P. Despite feeling short, Burzum is still an album worthy of a lot of respect, and an essential.\n",
        "\nBurzum has a long and controversial history. Amidst events such as the church burnings in the early nineties, the murder of guitarist Euronymous and the infamy of many stage antics for bands like Mayhem permitted the people of Norway to allow their imaginations run rampant of an infection in the form of Satanism and pure evil to emanate from the dark within the recesses of the Norwegian metal underground.\n\nVarg himself is, at least to me, an interesting person. His politics aside, it is undisputed that Varg is a talented musician and a jack of all trades with the synthesizer, guitar, drums and vocals. And these talents show in \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.\"\n\nAfter the strong debut of \"Burzum,\" and the somewhat weak \"Det Som Engang Var,\" Tar Oss serves as a bridge between Varg's general transition from black metal to a more lower-quality, ambient touch that would come to dominate \"Filosofem.\" The album starts with probably one of Burzum's most famous songs; \"Det Som Engang Var,\" continues with the song based on the album's title that carries a very dark tone, and \"Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen,\" serves as the album's third song that I would say is good, but not as good as the other three. The fourth song \"Tomhet,\" is one of many of Burzum's ambient songs, clocking in at over fourteen minutes and having a tone that is somewhat more upbeat than the other three songs. \n\nBy far, the album's first song (strangely enough carrying the title of the second album) is its best: Varg's eerie vocals, pounding drums and memorable guitar riffs coupled in with a clearly skilled usage of the synthesizer keyboard make it the strongest and most memorable song on the album. Despite the third song being somewhat weak in its repetitiveness (but it is a Burzum song, so who am I to complain?) it still is a good one that I definitely wouldn't skip over when listening to it. \n\nThe only weakness with the album is simply that there really aren't enough songs on it. All four of the ones on the album range from solid to fantastic, and \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" has a unique tone that applies to all of the band's individual albums, and it is unfortunate that there aren't more with this particular feeling that I can't find showing up again in the band's prior and later discography. Although to be fair, two of the songs alone take up 28 minutes combined, and with any more songs could take over an hour. \n\nAll of its problems aside, it is an excellent limbo between black metal and atmospheric music and is probably my favorite Burzum album, despite having only four songs. I would absolutely recommend it to any fan of black metal or ambient music in general.\n",
        "\nI'm amazed at the quality of this album. Very few modern black metal albums reach this level of quality. Belus was an excellent release, and Burzum's best in years, but it is not as good as it's follow up, Fallen.\n\nThe music on Fallen is beautiful sounding, and, while it has the aggression of black metal, It features extensive use of clean vocals, with the melodicrity of power metal. All of the choruses easily to remember, and they flow really well. Varg does just as good of a job at clean vocals as he does with rasped ones. The vocals on 'Jeg Faller' really stand out, with half of the song featuring well-defined clean vocals. These are actually sung, unlike earlier Burzum clean vocals, which were talked. Varg must have lost a lot of rasp from not singing during his time in prison, as it is unbelievable that this is the same guy who screams his head off with a howled sound. Fallen definitely has its share of rasped vocals as well, with the rasps being far more intense than on Belus, and they also have a slightly howled sound, like early Burzum. 'Vanvidd' has the harshest vocals, with some terrifying shrieks in the middle of the song. It's amazing how flexible his voice is.\n\nThe production is excellent, and people who say it's untrue are wrong. The album's production is fitting. A more melodic sound needs cleaner production. Varg himself said that a lot of time was spent on mastering the album. The production is much better than Belus, which, in my opinion, has the worst production of any Burzum album. It's very warm and thick, and everything sounds a bit muffled on that album. The production here is well finished, and it has great sharpness too it, but not to the point where it spoils the album by making it too light. The guitar tone here is also great, being very balanced, and it's not fuzzed or anything. You can hear a lot of what he is playing, but not all, as there are some very intricate overturned riffs as well. Multitracked guitars are a major part of Fallen, and the second, sometimes third guitar adds extra dimension to the album, and it makes everything sound fuller.\n\nIn the Burzum tradition, there has to be an ambient song. The ambient song on Fallen is the excellent 'Til Hel Og Tilbake Igjen'. This is a more experimental than ambient piece, actually, but it still manages to carry great ambiance. Some of Burzum's earlier ambient pieces, such as 'Rundgang um die transzendentale Saule der Singularitat' do a great job at creating a dark atmosphere, but they drag on for a little too long. 'Til Hel Og Tilbake Igjen' is shorter, and it still is good. There is also an ambient intro, but it isn't really a full song. It's just noise and whispering, rather than an actual composition. Nothing against it though. I find it very enjoyable.\n\nFallen is an excellent black metal that goes above and beyond with production and composition. I highly recommend that any heavy metal fan buy it.\n",
        "\nBurzum was prolific back in the early 90's. Varg released four albums within five years and they all brought something new to the table. After Burzum and Det som engang var, which were good but not perfect, Varg released Hvis lyset tar oss, his best work up to date. Filosofem had the chance to continue the streak and succeeded, at least partially. Because the fresh, energetic and dynamic start was interrupted by the latter three tracks, which are mostly ambient.\n\nFilosofem features three classic songs (four, if you count the 25-minute fifth track), 'Burzum', 'Jesu d\u00f8d' and 'Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament'. Every one of these tracks, while being monotonous, has a great atmosphere. And this minimalism works in the best possible way for the album, as it leads the listener into a trance-like state. Those cold, hypnotic riffs hold a well deserved spot among the greatest of the genre and I could keep listening to them forever. I mean, the guitars always play some kind of looping riff that crawls its way into your mind, the bass compliments the overall result really well and the drums... Well, the drums are out of this fucking world (especially in 'Jesu d\u00f8d'). Varg's voice has this usual torn-apart-vocal-cords feel that granted him his uniqueness (and which he ungratefully threw away in his recent releases), so until the fourth track everything is perfect.\n\nThe three final tracks have no drums. At all. No bass either, but there is a guitar riff in the fourth track, 'Decrepitude I'. The two Decrepitudes have their moments as well, but compared to the rest of the album, they are way below the already raised stakes. As for that fifth track, it's not sub-par but it feels like a very long way from start to finish, probably because it is a very long fucking way from start to finish. But still it's not bad. It could be shrunken though, to a length suitable to those of the rest songs in here and that is one of the cons. If we divide Filosofem in two, the second half is way longer than the first, while the style that should hold the greatest portion is the one displayed in the first half of the record.\n\nBut again, the overall result remains well written, actually it is so carefully composed, that it remains relevant twenty years after its initial release and that's what makes Filosofem special and all its flaws, not easy to ignore but easy to forgive. It might not be the heaviest of its kind, or the fastest in terms of execution, or even the most atmospheric, but it's a great album and deep inside you know it. And I know it too.\n\nFavorite tracks: 'Burzum', 'Jesu d\u00f8d', 'Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament'.\n\n80/100.\n",
        "\nNo one can say Dau\u00f0i Baldrs was recorded under the best circumstances. While the most infamous murder in rock history most directly robbed us of Euronymous, who had only recently hit his stride on De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, but Varg Vikernes' incarceration put a considerable handicap on his musical output. Consider this: Varg had gone from the primitive sketches on Burzum to a timeless mastery come Filosofem in the space of a year. What kind of music might we have expected to hear from him, had he kept his nose out of the dirt, free to record without the constraints of a prison cell? No matter the path he may have chosen, chances are it would be nowhere near as disappointing as Dau\u00f0i Baldrs.\n\nIn most other cases, it seems I'm actually a rare supporter of Burzum's ambient material, new and old. While there's no comparing The Ways of Yore to, let's say, Hvis lyset tar oss, I think Vikernes' innate ear for ancient atmosphere comes across no matter which side of the tracks he's coming from. His skill with ambiance was apparent from the start too; the self-titled debut ended on an eerie note with \"Dungeons of Darkness\". Had I been anticipating Dau\u00f0i Baldrs before it came out, I wouldn't have any reason to think it was going to be bad. Keep in mind this is the same guy who managed to keep me enthralled for 25 minutes with the minimalist \"Rundgang um die transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t\" off the album before. \n\nPeople who hate on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs simply for not being 'metal' undoubtedly fail to understand Vikernes' character as a musician, and I'm sure he laughs at them. No, the real problem with Dau\u00f0i Baldrs is how far it fell short of what it should have been. There's no doubting he had challenges; he wasn't permitted use of 'real' instruments, and the artistic capacity for a prison-sponsored computer in 1997 is no doubt horribly limiting, but that can't fully be to blame for this. Dau\u00f0i Baldrs sounds like it was recorded largely with the cheapest MIDI sounds Varg could find. The chosen sounds clearly mean to approximate 'real' instruments, but it's as if the man was still up to his 'worst is best' doctrine when it came to recording the music. The palette of fake horns and lifeless percussion on the title track is almost laughably hollow. If I were to play devil's advocate with this, I might suspect Vikernes imagined it as a soundtrack to an unmade computer RPG. I could see some of the stuff here possibly working in that regard, but even then I could see a lot of it getting annoying as all hell if it were looping endlessly while I dungeon crawled. Varg's penchant for repetitive minimalism didn't go anywhere when he went to prison, so the given loops here even manage to get grating.\n\nThe cheap MIDI palette on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs makes the Runescape soundtrack sound like a von Karajan production by contrast, but there is some authentic atmosphere that exists in spite of the fakeness. The title track is undoubtedly the worst offender o the lot, and though it's one of the most laughably bad songs I've heard from an otherwise brilliant artist, the rest of Dau\u00f0i Baldrs gets a fair bit better. \"Hermo\u00f0r \u00e1 Helfer\u00f0\" is simple and quaint. \"Illa ti\u00f0andi\" actually hints at Vikernes' genius as a composer with an incredibly basic but evocative piano line that sorts more realized than the faux-orchestrations. I'd say \"M\u00f3ti Ragnar\u01ebkum\" actually holds up to the rest of his ambient material; it's a sign of how good this album could have been in spite of the budget restrictions.\n\nDau\u00f0i Baldrs is interesting as a historical artefact, and I'd say there's even some solid material here for those who don't mind its damning flaw. I can even hear good intentions on the album, and the corresponding mythological concept even suggests some thoughtfulness. Varg can attach paragraphs of supposed significance to each of these pieces if he wants to, but at the end of the day, I can't see myself feeling an urge to return to this at some point in the future. As much as I'd like to defend this album, it's an almost completely unworthy successor to Filosofem.\n",
        "\nFor an artist commonly maligned as a stylistic 'gateway' to black metal, Burzum's music doesn't really welcome casual listening. You've got to be fully invested in the atmosphere; elsewise, it's easy to let the extent of Vikernes' brooding genius to escape beneath the radar. What's more, I think Burzum needs the span of an entire album to get his point across. A strong atmosphere tends to build upon itself, and the songs on the strongest Burzum records tend to amplify the atmosphere of the tracks around them. \n\nAll of this could be said for most great ambient music, but very rarely does it apply to metal. I begin a review of Hvis lyset tar oss with this observation because the all-or-nothing nature of an experience with Burzum is part of the reason why it's taken so long for me to realize that Vikernes' music is far more than the visible sum of its parts. Exposure to a few of the better-known songs on their own did little to inspire me, and I'd virtually assumed the legend and acclaim was a by-product of certain other, explicitly non-musical antics Vikernes had been associated with.\n\nIt takes a full, undivided surrender to Vikernes' grasp of atmosphere to appreciate Burzum for what it is. Possibly moreso than any other part of music, it is impossible to achieve atmosphere through structured, procedural means. An atmospheric effect comes together through an unknown proportion of ingredients, and like anything else of a supernatural quality, there is no way to arrive at it empirically. Atmosphere must be conjured as it is experienced; intuitively, and with the insight and willingness to plant one foot in another world. Say what you will otherwise; Varg had an incredible sensitivity to the pulse of atmosphere in music. The music may be associated with Second Wave canon, but there's a timeless, simultaneously ancient nature to Burzum's classics that could not be replicated short of boasting the same inspiration the man felt in the year he recorded his first four full-lengths. \n\nAs it happens, Hvis lyset tar oss isn't the first album to spout this ageless atmosphere, but it is the first where his more empirical talents as a composer and recording artist became apparent. Where the self-titled debut and Det som engang var were refreshingly primitive and undercooked in their songwriting, by this third album it sounds like Vikernes was seasoned enough to second-guess his first drafts. His compositions now favoured steady repetition and an increasingly tactical use of his ingredients, all to the benefit of his atmosphere. Hvis lyset tar oss itself would be dwarfed by the ultimately superior Filosofem, but there's no fault in calling this the first 'great' album Vikernes ever made.\n\nDistilling Hvis lyset tar oss down to a handful of longer tracks is indicative of the leaps Vikernes was making in his music. In improving his music, he wasn't adding new content so much as stripping away the unnecessary articles. The redundant factors towards his atmosphere are done away with; it's rare that an idea sounds like it could have been done away with in his compositions from this point forward. Minimalism presents its own set of challenges to a composer; rather than trying to write as much great material as possible, the minimalist must have confidence in a few repeating motifs to relate his message. From the first demo, Varg had always been a gifted riffmaker, but it wasn't until this one that exploited each individual idea to their fullest extent.\n\n\"Det som en gang var\" may have shared the second album's name, but it sounds leagues beyond a lot of the 'learning process' songwriting that defined the first two. This is the first Burzum masterpiece, a song that ferments a unique atmosphere from the start, and takes its time in doing so. Cold ambiance builds over the course of minutes, making the change into the album's most memorable riff pack so much more of a punch. The calculated minimalism is parried with the ever-raw sound of the music. Varg's screams still sound visceral and nearly inhuman, although there's a solipsistic egotism to the cathartic howls that still place Vikernes' expression as distinctly human, personality-based art. An unfocused handling of riffs at the end of the album sounds like a bit of a misstep on the composer's part, but \"Det som en gang var\" would still scrape the top of the list if Burzum's strongest works were ever ordered by weight of their inspiration.\n\nHvis lyset tar oss channelled its successor Filosofem's majesty from the start, but the two tracks that follow it lack the same sense of awe. Neither the title track nor \"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\" seem to leap out at me, despite the fact that Vikernes made them used the exact same ingredients as the first. He's still just as confident in his use of their motifs, but the motifs themselves aren't as compelling as I'd hope to hear in an album many claim to rank among the genre's best. Try as I might, the centre-section on Hvis... sounds comparably dry to me. While my appreciation for \"Det som en gang var\" and the fourteen minute ambient \"Tomhet\" have steadily grown over the course of listens, \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" and \"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\" don't burst through the euphoric wall for me. Some of the riffs on the latter are particularly enjoyable to listen to, but considering the sort of pantheonic consideration Hvis lyset tar oss is privy to, I might have been expecting an album that amazed me the whole way through.\n\nA consistently masterful work by Burzum wouldn't arrive until Filosofem, released already a while into Varg's prison sentence. Judging from reviews I've read for Burzum, it seems people will do or say anything to escape potential controversy. Mr. Vikernes' politik is, and was more appropriately discussed alongside Filosofem, so if I still have anything controversial to say here, it would be that Hvis lyset tar oss played a developmental role in Varg's progress more in line with Det som engang var than Filosofem's conclusive mastery. This is a great album; it's got a masterstroke of an opener and a bold ambient track that finally brought his synth ambitions full circle. Even the two less vibrant tracks here boast Vikernes' maturity as a composer. Even so, his progress wasn't over yet, and to compare this with Filosofem as similarly excellent albums seems like a case of mass-adopted hubris.\n",
        "\nI find myself increasingly drawn towards the work of Varg Vikernes the more I learn about who he was as an artist. This seems to have had an opposite effect on many others. You'll see people begin their reviews with some vague preface on how it takes everything in their power to turn a blind eye on the man, his acts, and worldviews. When he's not giving liberal 'metalheads' a conflict of conscience, he's also prime fodder for the online meme machine. His idiosyncracies and his intensity made him a pariah back when the Second Wave was going on, and the same is even more true nowadays. To separate the art from its source is the worst kind of politically correct revisionism. It shouldn't matter if you personally disagree with the content of his politik; there's something to be gained from a man who uncompromisingly followed his own path to the point of being laughed at years afterward. Had he not felt so passionately about his dream of a 'pure' Norway, you can bet he wouldn't have perfected his atmosphere, from debut to peak, in the space of a single year.\n\nGiven that Vikernes recorded his four 'core' albums so close together, it seems less relevant to call Det som engang far his transition album, even if that's what it was: a bridge between the adolescent riff brigade on the self-titled, and the timeless mysticism of the almighty Hvis lyset tar oss and Filosofem. With Burzum recorded only three months before this, it's obvious Varg took great lengths to tighten his craft in the time between. Although it only took him 7 more hours to record Det som engang far than its predecessor (from a hurried 19 to a still-hurried 26 hours) the result was a significantly more confident and atmospheric album. I don't think Vikernes had quite figured out how to put his riffs to their best use, but he was getting there.\n\nThe stronger grip of structure made Det som engang var Varg's first truly solid album. That's not to say Burzum didn't earn its classic status at least in part, but where the songs there sounded like a blunt declaration of intent, this second album started to show signs of maturity, even sophistication. For Varg, he's never sounded less than raw or primitive, but the quality of his work has depended on the intent and focus through which he's able to funnel that energy. Again, it all goes back to structure in this case. The longer songs on Burzum did little for me, and I thought his grasp was better fitted for short, punchy pieces like \"The Crying Orc\" and (huh!) \"War\". Varg was a great riffmaker from the earliest years onward, but it's only here on Det som engang var that he began to make those longer pieces worthwhile. He did that not necessarily by adding substance to his epics, but distilling them to their essential ingredients, having confidence enough to let a few slower motifs run the course of the listen. That draw towards a sort of primitive minimalism would be counter-intuitive in the hands of most of his Second Wave contemporaries, but for Varg, ever the introspective filosofer, it was presumably the natural course for his art to take. \n\nThat shift in a young man's musical direction coincidentally birthed a new branch of black metal. While Det som engang var doesn't go far enough with its slower threads to warrant the atmospheric black metal tag, \"En ring til aa herske\" and \"Snu mikrokosmos tegn\" are easily the best things the album has to offer, demonstrating a glimmer of Vikernes at his best. Outside of these two centrepieces, the album's musical direction is pretty evenly split between faster black metal of the demo's variety, and a handful of spooky dungeon ambient pieces. It's the latter that manages to impress me more, actually; synth intros and interludes are some of the most overused throwaway trash in black metal, and Varg is one of the few who has known how to make them feel worthwhile. \"Han som reiste\" sounds like the soundtrack to a D&D dungeon crawl, and I mean that in the best way; it is dark without being overtly malevolent, extremely cheap but subjectively authentic. The more typical early Burzum fare like \"Lost Wisdom\" doesn't show much improvement over the original demo versions save for the fact that the most glaring technical fuck-ups have been smoothened out. \"Key to the Gate\", however, is one of the most startling tracks ever produced by Burzum; it sounds thrashy, chaotic, dissonant and clearly death metal-influenced in a way that wouldn't become more popular in the genre until years later. \n\nCalling this a transition album would come with the assumption that this was a stopgap in wait for Burzum's real masterpieces. Make no mistake; Varg Vikernes would multiply his capacity for ancient atmosphere come Hvis lyset tar oss, but Det som engang var holds its own. This is the one album of his that seems to draw upon all of his stylistic motivations: raw, fast, slow, atmospheric, ambient. By the coming of his next album, he would have already made the evolution to the point where his sound excluded the raw force of the self-titled and Aske EP. It may not have been imagined with the same genius as the two masterworks that followed it, but nonetheless, it more than earns its place in the Second Wave pantheon.\n",
        "\nI listened to the albums canonically referred to as Burzum's 'masterpieces' before getting around to the project's self-titled debut. As tends to be the case with then-future greats with such classics in their futures, Burzum set the stage on a less refined, less intentional note than the carefully crafted master's atmosphere Varg Vikernes would be recording just a year later. While every incarnation of Burzum has been about upholding an unfashionable degree of primitivism in the music, there's no denying Vikernes became ever more meticulous in the way he brought about his raw sound. I see Filosofem get compared favourably with modern classical minimalism. The debut isn't going to warrant associations like that any time soon.\n\nIt is interesting to hear Burzum's debut; this is where a lot of it all started, and you can still hear bands coming out today that have tried to replicate the archetype he made here. With that said, it is surprising that I don't feel I have too much to say about it, especially compared to Filosofem, which carries enough weight in its atmosphere to inspire multiple volumes. Is it because the debut necessarily suffers by association with its better-crafted cousins? Not necessarily; although everything of Vikernes' making inevitably carries a distinctive Burzum character, the style here is much different than what came after it; comparisons only go so far. Put simply, this is early black metal at some of its most intuitive. It is raw in every sense of the word, and that includes the way it was written. Burzum sounds like it came together in a flurry, without regard for what does or doesn't work on the record. That rawness-- paired with Vikernes' natural predilection for great riffmaking-- is more than enough to carry his first full-length through, although it would still be an album or two before his vision hit its stride.\n\nStarting off, Vikernes was more riff-focused than many of his contemporaries, and the debut essentially sounds like a bunch of solid riffs thrown together onto a cassette, with markedly less emphasis given to other parts of the music, like the structure or the songwriting. \"Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\", \"Spell of Destruction\", \"War\", \"The Crying Orc\" and \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" all wield instantly memorable riffs, but whether they're all necessarily great songs is another matter. Particularly with the two longer songs on the latter half (\"Side Winter\"), it doesn't feel like Vikernes made the most of their greater scope. While great riffs are immediately possible to write for someone with the right innate talent, things like tact and structure are learned with time. Keeping in mind again that it was only a year between this and his atmospheric masterpieces, it's clear his black metal education was swift and effective.\n\nGrimy heavy metal-flavoured riffs, fearsome drumming and some half-effective early attempts at adopting dungeon ambient form the musical core for this debut, but it's Vikernes' vocals that leave the strongest impression. His rancid shrieks are possibly the best representation of his musical objectives: primitive, personal, and utterly void of bells nor whistles. Burzum sounds like it was written and recorded by someone who was still learning to write and record. If his musical objectives remained constant throughout Burzum's early years, then he hadn't quite reached his mark here. There's nothing in the way of profound epiphany to be experienced listening to this, but the quality of his conviction and riffs is enough to excuse the abundant obvious flaws throughout the album.\n",
        "\n\"Do you think Filosofem and Hvis lyset tar oss would be considered masterpieces if they were released this year?\" I asked a friend of mine a month or so ago. My experience with Burzum up until that point had been remarkably shallow, and the single-serving listens I'd given some of Vikernes' best-known songs had not done a lot to convince me the music had earned its status without the help of some over-discussed arsons and/or stabbing party that happened in Norway some years ago.\n\n\"Yeah I do,\" he replied; \"The music has a timeless quality to it.\" Another friend noted Filosofem as the perfect embodiment of 'cold' atmosphere. I'm glad I've known folk who could interpret and experience this music outside the bounds of sensationalism; experiencing Filosofem has been a long time coming for me, and it's with self-admitted regret that I've let a monument like this pass me by for so long.\n\nFirst off; it has been a nagging pet peeve to read review after review of Burzum's music that tries to separate an appreciation of the music with the ideas behind its making, much less the man himself. You see this kind of pussyfooting whenever someone's talking about an unfashionably right-wing group but it's never so pronounced as it is with Burzum. The appeal of mystically-inclined ambient black metal is arguably wider than Varg's politik, but a willingness to explore the music without opening oneself to the ideas behind the work is to miss an essential part of the point. Filosofem wears its intention in the very title; this album is a manifest philosophy, and though the music and lyrics don't touch upon the political specifics of his Odalist pro-racial agenda, that intent seeps through every minute of Filosofem. \n\nPossibly moreso than any black metal album I've heard, Filosofem truly evokes a longing for an ancient past. For music crafted with the most minimalist, simple and repeated ingredients, the atmosphere is richly evocative; it is as if the music was robbed from another time, real or imagined. I do not believe Filosofem would be felt so powerfully, did Varg not feel so powerfully about his vision for a pure(r) Norway. Atmosphere in music is often intangible; it is as hard to replicate as it is to properly write about. In Burzum's case, Varg Vikernes managed to create an incredible (and, indeed, timeless) palette of sound with the seemingly laziest elements at his disposal. Foregoing the use of proper microphones or even a proper amplifier (the guitar tone was brought about using distortion pedals plugged into his brother's stereo) he created a sound that's all too easy to become lost in. Compare that to the tens-of-thousands of hours of mindless bedroom demos that have spawned forth since. Some of them might be decently imagined, but it's not likely any manage to spurn a session of contemplating your own philosophies in life. Filosofem manages to do this, and more.\n\nThough it's easy to confuse his musical priorities with laziness, his tactical use of keyboards in his music enforces the notion of Varg as a brilliant composer. For one of the simplest motifs you'll ever hear in music, the brooding three/four note keyboard overlay on \"Dunkelheit (Burzum)\" is instantly and greatly memorable. Varg has a penchant for these hook-bearing 'earworms' that you almost never hear in an atmospheric or ambient context. \"Jesu d\u00f8d\" is just as impactful a track as the first without help of keys at all, with little more than a few repetitive guitar riffs to see it through. How Burzum's best work manages to do so much with so little is virtually indecipherable on an academic, objective level. It is music that can, must, and will be felt by whomever listens to it.\n\nThe sense of Filosofem doing intense things to the psyche with so few concrete ideas is best represented in \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\", the album's twenty-five minute centrepiece, and apparently still the thing most listeners (outside of the PC whiners) have the toughest time grappling with. As a fan of progressive music long before I came into black metal, I instantly loved how Vikernes' ambient music sounds so close to the Berlin School of electronic music, in the minimalist vein of Klaus Schulze or Tangerine Dream. The first half builds up a single motif; the second half is spent dwindling it down. \n\nOf course, that brief description tells little of the way it affects the spirit while listening to it. \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\" feels both like a denouement to the 'metal' side of the album and climax in its own right. As a composer and musician, Vikernes' work on Filosofem is defined by how he economizes the use of ideas, and this 25 minute sprawl stands as a definitive realization of that intent. Bookended by parts one and two of \"Decrepitude\" (which seems to bridge the gap stylistically between the black metal and full ambient chunks of the album) the album's sequence doesn't place it as an afterthought so much as a full-bodied other part of the music that should be regarded just as intently as the three-or-so songs people are originally coming for. In a sense, Vikernes was already recognizing the close-mindedness of the lion's share of the black metal scene and was already playing against it pre-emptively.\n\nThough the ambient centre of the album does seem to go between five and ten minutes longer than might have been optimal for atmosphere's sake, Filosofem still sounds bold and relevant. Even today, there are so few artists that decide to fuck what all others think or will think of their art. I don't get the impression Varg's artistic choices were done as a way to seem 'cool' so much as the behaviour of some of the Second Wave's other star players... He simply felt something deeply to the point that it defined him as a person, and he possessed the musical talent to bring that psychic energy into the material world with his music. I'll say again; those who wish to avert their fragile eyes away from the essential meaning of what he was trying to say are losing sight of what this music is really about. Without feeling something so specific so strongly, the supposedly 'universal' atmosphere here would not have existed to begin with.\n",
        "\nNo matter what Mr. Vikernes says, Burzum's first four albums are highly influential and regarded as essential black metal releases. They contained the much coveted \"buzzsaw\" guitar tone and raw production that really elevated the atmosphere of the music to huge proportions. It's quite a well-known fact that Varg himself has never considered the music of Burzum to be black metal, but rather simply as \"heavy metal\", on his early albums anyway. Obviously the sound of this music is very much black metal with dark ambient injected within. \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" is Burzum's third full-length album. It was recorded in 1992 but wasn't released until 1994, shortly before Varg was convicted for the notorious murder of Mayhem guitarist Euronymous, as well as the arson of several Norwegian churches. This album, along with \"Burzum\", \"Det som engang var\", and it's successor \"Filosofem\", is widely regarded as a classic from the Norwegian second-wave. In addition to that, it elevated black metal to new heights and for its time, really started something new: atmospheric, ambient black metal. With its repetition and minimalism, \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" is an album that has captivated many fans of black metal since 1994 and since I heard it for the first time back in early 2010, has remained my favorite black metal album of all time. I know there is not too much to be said about this album that hasn't already been put out there, however I feel it is my duty to give my opinions based on this album, not only because it's highly influential but also because it just means so much to me personally. \n\nThis is not a complex album in terms of musical composition. These songs focus only on a few musical ideas throughout their fairly long run times. Even so, it is an album driven by emotion and atmosphere. The guitars really don't step outside themselves too much in the first three songs. Take the album's opener, for example, the 14 and a half minute journey that is \"Det som en gang var\". This song begins with a fairly hypnotic guitar passage that is extremely minimal and simplistic, but changes once the drums make their introduction. The guitar work in this song is really only secondary to the absolutely gorgeous synth passage that sets the standard for this song. My favorite moment of this song is when the guitars imitate this keyboard line with a tremolo riff that almost resembles a guitar solo. Towards the end of this epic masterpiece, we are treated to yet another somber keyboard passage. There really isn't much to note about technicality here, but that was really not the focus of this album. There is one moment that does stick out a bit in terms of technicality with the guitar solo towards the end of \"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\" which is still not all that complex. This album definitely achieved its goal of reaching an extremely hypnotic, desolate sound that I'm sure has influenced many of the DSBM bands we have today. In fact, even when this album shows its more aggressive side such as with the title track, this music remains extremely emotionally driven. This album is often regarded as a huge influence among DSBM bands and it's quite easy to see why. \n\nVarg truly sounds like a depressed, lonely soul on this album. Whenever I throw this album on and immerse myself in all of its melancholic beauty, I get feelings of absolute solitude. Varg's vocals are absolutely amazing on this album. This is obviously another idea a lot of the DSBM bands, such as Nyktalgia and Sterbend, have adopted into their sound. These vocals are not typical black metal screams and rasps we hear with bands such as Darkthrone, but rather high-pitched wails and screams of despair that sound like wolves howling in pain. These tormented vocals have been a practice and standard element of Burzum's music up to this point, but it's on this album where he really perfects that effect. Thanks to Burzum, we do have a lot of \"wannabes\" and \"copycats\" in black metal today of which some sound really good, but they can never live up to this album. This is not an album that set the standard, but rather the album that exceeded any and all standards before they could even be set. \n\nIf you are listening to Burzum's records in order beginning with his 1992 debut, the production value of this album really shouldn't be a shock to you. His music is quite lo-fi and fuzzy which all helps to add an amazing tone to the atmosphere. This album was recorded in the legendary Grieghallen Studio which is also responsible for recording dozens of other important albums. Much like his previous efforts, Varg didn't use high-speed recording equipment to make this album. Instead, he opted for a very basic and stripped down approach which really only enhances the quality of the music. If it wasn't for this lo-fi approach to production, this album would not be as effective with its atmosphere. This really is not the rawest, most underproduced black metal album out there. Even those who haven't completely trained their ears for black metal shouldn't have a hard time listening to this speaking in terms of harshness. This can't even be described as his most-underproduced album in my opinion. In fact, it seems that Varg really upped his game in regards to production. He didn't polish this album or anything like that, but it seems to be a much more stable release when being compared to the previous albums. The ambiance is multiplied greatly on this release as well. We are treated to a 14-minute piece entitled \"Tomhet\" which serves as the album's closer. Out of the four tracks, this is the only fully ambient one. It's extremely minimal and repetitive in nature, like the other tracks, but fully void of guitars, using only keyboards to create beautiful electronic soundscapes. There is a slight folky influence brought forth with this track, but it's not too prevalent and can only be slightly picked up upon.\n\nAn album that certainly has survived the test of time and has made its permanent mark on the history of black metal, \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" is a dark journey through a world of dreams and magic. This album is indeed Burzum's finest output and it's very unlikely any other album will ever top it as far as black metal goes. If you're already familiar with Burzum and black metal overall, I'm sure this is an album you've heard or at least heard of. I highly recommend listening to this for those who haven't, because it is just that important of an album.\n",
        "\nAs we all know, Burzum mastermind Varg Vikernes was arrested in 1994 for the arson of several churches in Norway, as well as the murder of once associate and guitarist, Euronymous. He was sentenced to the maximum penalty of 21 years, however, was released in 2009 after serving almost 16 years of his sentence. Under the Burzum name, Varg released his first studio album in ten years, \"Belus\". This was a return to the harsh black metal sound of old, and after only a year or so, Burzum came back with \"Fallen\" in 2011. Musically, this album is fairly similar to \"Belus\", yet its production is far more refined and the structure is a bit different. This is Burzum's most well-produced release to my ears and in my opinion, is the best album he has released since \"Filosofem\". \n\nThis album is the logical sequel to \"Belus\". There are no keyboards to be heard on this album, and the guitar is the main area of focus. These riffs range from being fast and in-your-face to beautifully and elegantly melodic. After an ambient intro made up of basically whispering, \"Jeg Faller\" begins with a fast black metal tremolo riff. Followed by blast beats, this song probably has the most elegant chorus on the entire album. This riff is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for a long time. I always find myself humming along to it. I do not intend to go track by track on this review, but a lot of these songs work in similar ways with the melodic riffs, and certain ones must be addressed. Track three, \"Valen\", also contains a beautiful chorus riff and the intro to this song is almost \"bouncy\" and up beat. There are some very dark songs on this album, such as the almost evil sounding \" Enhver til sitt\", but for the most part, these songs are all sound much lighter than dark. Some of the fastest riffing on the album can be heard in \"Vanvidd\", also contains about two minutes of straight blast beats.\n\nThe drumming on this album is standard Burzum. It goes from mid-paced, such as \"Valen\" which contains no blast beats, and the aforementioned \"Vanvidd\", which contains an amplified amount of them. The drumming does sound quite similar throughout some of these songs. \"Valen\" and \"Jeg faller\" in particular have practically the same drum lines, minus the blasts in \"Jeg faller\". Like I said earlier in the review, the production is very clean compared to \"Belus\" and actually anything else Varg has put out in his career. There is still enough fuzz and the guitars still sound tinny enough to create that classic Burzum atmosphere, but the clarity on all the instruments is amplified by quite a bit. According to Varg himself, he \"produced this album as one would produce classical music\". I assume by this, he was referring to how organic this record sounds. It certainly does sound organic, but with a nice studio sheen over it. This really ups the quality of the atmosphere and makes the album sound huge and epic. This also attributes to the album's bright sound. Albums like \"Det som engang var\" and \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" would sound better if listened to while sitting around a fire in the midnight forest. \"Fallen\" would sound much better if listened to walking through the forest on a brisk summer morning. Burzum may translate to \"darkness\", but this is some of the most light, up beat black metal I have ever heard.\n\nSomething that really stuck out upon first listen is the increased use of clean vocals. Varg still uses harsh vocals on all of the metal tracks on the album, but he uses clean vocals on every track as well. He has done this on albums in the past, notably the song \"Dunkelheit\" from the album \"Filosofem\" and some of the tracks on \"Belus\", however' they are used in much greater quantity on this album. \"Jeg faller\" probably contains the greatest amount vocals and only two sections of the song contain screaming. Whether it's clean singing or spoken word, there are plenty of cleans on here and they all sound very good. Varg's vocal ability certainly hasn't decreased over the years.\n\nYes, Varg Vikernes might be a bit of a \"nut\" in a lot of people's eyes, and I don't agree with everything he says, but I don't give a damn what his political views are. The guy creates amazing music, be it ambient, folk, or the classic black metal he has always been known for creating. This is definitely Burzum's greatest release since \"Filosofem\", and while his ambient albums are great in my opinion, they will never touch this album. Unfortunately, Varg has decided to stop playing metal, and 2012's \"Umskiptar\" remains the last metal album by Burzum. Whether you're a fan of Burzum or black metal in general, I'm sure you'll enjoy this record.\n",
        "\nSometimes, the moment you hit play, something happens. A wave of feeling, of intangible signals, of general escape, comes over you and you are no longer listening to music: the music is happening and you are happening with it. Such a thing occurs when 'Filosofem' begins. The opening screech of 'Burzum' (I'm going with the Norwegian songtitles here, since it seems silly to always talk about the popular German edition) hits you and then you are under; some spell or curse becomes active and you should leave the room and enter a world of atmosphere and lonely, primal archaisms. The cover image is ideal for this kind of music, since it is something extremely simple yet untouchable for our modern understanding. Who can explain why the woman sounds the clarion from the top of the hill or why it fills us with such inscrutable emotions? The clarion is a medieval instrument which was sounded to signify the commencement of a hunt or to rally a resistance in battle; it's also an adjective that means clear and ringing, while the verb means to proclaim loudly.\n\nMuch can be taken from that image and the album title 'Filosofem'. This is Vikernes's defining statement of his mission and, lest we forget, was released (though not recorded) while he was in prison for the murder of Euronymous of Mayhem. There is something defiant about the woman with the trumpet bellowing loudly across the hills, while there is also something profoundly mysterious about it that will not allow us to fully grasp its significance. The same goes for the music on this album. There are some incredibly bold statements and there are some willfully perverse moments as well. The most common distinction is between the first three tracks and the last three, which are often separated by listeners because of the starkly opposing sounds they use. Personally, I do not see such a strong distinction in the composition of these tracks, since the atmosphere remains regular enough to complete the experience that began unfolding with the opening song.\n\nThe black metal actually only extends 23 minutes into this album, with no particular metal influence (vocals aside) on the other tracks, which are primarily atmospheric or ambient pieces, almost sounding industrial at times. The black metal is very much in the early Darkthrone vein: repeating riffs, fast pace, ragged guitar tone with a lot of distortion, plus fairly long songs. However, Vikernes has always been able to create a hypnotic effect to the riffs, utilizing what I might term minimalist blastbeats that lower the aggression of the song instead of increasing it, in the punky, rock and roll way that Dartkthrone would. This makes it easy for a song like 'Jesu d\u00f8d' to fall into a very simple riff structure for four or five minutes without any special changes - the fury of the riff is so focused that it leads to ritual repetition and ritual states of mind. As such, Burzum is never tiring to listen to, because the length of the experience in fact enhances the effect of the music. Those first three songs are almost perfect, especially the details that prevent the songs being generic: the slow keyboard in 'Burzum', the subtle riff change in 'Jesu d\u00f8d' - there's really nothing you would change.\n\nThe latter three songs are tougher to work out. There are two parts of 'Decrepitude', which are quite similar, while 'Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte' is a lengthy ambient piece made of incredibly minimalist keyboard parts. This song waits 10 minutes until its first change, dawdling on the verge of near silence, yet there is something captivating about it, as if it were the centre of the storm and the perfect point at which to see everything. I think that 'Tomhet', the ambient piece from the previous album, was a greater achievement and generally a better piece of music, but 'Rundtg\u00e5ing' is calming and reassuring, whereas 'Tomhet' tried to be revelatory - they both suit their parent albums. I don't like 'Decrepitude' much (especially the first part) because I don't find it pleasant to listen to, though I will say that Vikernes chose exactly the right name for it, since it sounds like the interminable clatter and longing of old age.\n\nAs with any album like this, 'Filosofem' really only works as a complete piece. If I add up the sum of its parts, its net worth is three great songs and a couple of reading songs, yet if one gives the album their time, it can engulf everything and be an immensely positive experience. Whatever his more extreme views, I have always found Vikernes's lyrics and albums reassuring and intricate, and 'Filosofem' is a worthwhile investment, though an occasionally impenetrable listen.\n",
        "\nAfter Varg Vikernes had released his debut album, the self-titled 'Burzum' and the EP 'Aske', 'Det som engang var' was released swiftly. Being Burzum's second full-length album and one of the four or so albums recorded in just over a year, one would think that it would sound a lot like 'Burzum' or 'Aske', since black metal is fairly one-dimensonial by nature. This, however, was not the case. 'Det som engang var' is black metal. Absolutely. But it's surprisingly varied when compared to Burzum's earlier releases, as well as in comparison to other Norwegian black metal acts releasing stuff at the same time, for instance Darkthrone and Immortal. \n\nIt was clear that Varg had a pretty good idea what he wanted his Burzum-project to sound like already when he started out. He wanted to combine the harsh, chaotic nature of raw black metal with the atmospheric and almost cinematic nature of ambient music. This, combined with the fantasy-based lyrical themes (most notably J.R.R. Tolkien's work) worked out superbly, and 'Det som engang var' is the album where the whole package comes together properly.\n\nThis album has the cold, harsh raw black metal sound, but of the very old-school kind that has elements of thrash and death, but significantly less of this than on previous Burzum releases and indeed the earlier offerings of other bands of the time. The ambient elements are more defined on this album and become a very important piece to the atmosphere intended to put the listener into some kind of trance.\n\nThese ambient elements are conjured using the keys who drive many of the songs on here. The instrumental opener \"Den onde kysten\", the epic \"En ring til \u00e5 herske\", the completely synth-driven \"Han som reiste\" and album-closer \"Svarte troner\" are all dominated by the dark ambient sound via synthesizer. But the ambience is also, at times, supported by melodic, melancholic guitars such as on \"N\u00e5r himmelen klarner\".\n\nThe more aggressive and heavy, dark and raw elements of black metal are, although, very much alive. \"Key to the Gate\" starts with a bang and is just a heavy, furious black metal song, but with a sorrowful twist thanks to some excellent work before a melodic, melancholic guitar-solo kicks in. Brief, but very effective in its quest to create a varied and beautiful track despite the aggression being the prominent emotion.\n\n\"Lost Wisdom\" is song akin to \"Key to the Gate\", but it's a bit more old-school like with the Hellhammer influence. It's got a very groovy and memorable main-riff that has a great deal a swagger to it. The song remains fairly original, though, because nobody at the time used the terrifying shrieks for vocals as Varg did.\n\n'Det som engang var' is very much the old-school Burzum we know. A bit less \"mature\" than later releases from the 90s (face it, 'Hvis lyset tar oss' and 'Filosofem' are the ultimate black metal albums), but the excellent execution of the combination of raw black metal and dark ambient make this album great. I would also consider it a tad bit more accessible than Burzum's other 90s albums.\n",
        "\nIs this a black metal album? If it is, it's downright the best black metal album I have ever heard, but I'm having trouble lumping this into the same category as Darkthrone, Marduk, Immortal, Enslaved or Mayhem, the bands that shaped black metal for me personally. I'm a death metal fan, but I've been listening to black metal far longer than I have listened to death metal. I'm not sure how it went, but I do know that Marduk was at one point in my early teen years my favorite band, largely due to the fact I was looking for speed and nothing else. I knew a lot of black metal staples purely from exploration but never really \"bonded\" with the genre because I listened to it purely for speed. Now that I'm listening to metal for better reasons, I've long been wanting to give black metal a new chance after having discovered most of what thrash and death had to offer. One of the first albums I listened to was Sons Of Northern Darkness, and there I found out what my main issue with black metal turned out to be; it's painfully repetitive. Perhaps I'm exaggerating, but I thought technical death metal was a tired concept...that was before I even gave black metal that chance I so long wanted to give it. Really, nearly every black metal album I've heard so far has 2 or 3 good songs with the rest providing nothing of worth whatsoever, some albums are exceptions and some just do so much right that I can hardly dislike it, but my favorite form of black metal is rooted in blackened death or blackened thrash metal, further proving that in contrary to thrash or death, black metal just isn't what I'm looking for.\n\nAnyway, here we have Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Presumably a black metal album, but in fact more of an ambient release to me. Sure, the bulk of the approach is black metal-based, but this album doesn't have many riffs, it does emphasize on what black metal usually does too, but it's stripped down so far that it basically leaves only the skeleton behind, resulting in this album thriving on its atmosphere more than anything else, much like Transilvanian Hunger, only even more stripped-down and far more ambient. On that album, you can still clearly hear it's black metal more than whatever genre, and while I can hear the black on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, it's far too minimalistic for this to be called a black metal album more than it can be called an ambient record. And thus I consider this ambient. Weirdly enough, this basically focuses on pushing all the problems I have with black metal to a great extreme, which means that I should hate this album, but I don't. Not at all. It's fairly logical that you'll get ambient if you strip down black metal this far, but for some reason I like this more than any pure black metal album ever. \n\nHvis Lyset Tar Oss is atmospheric, it's beautiful, but it's pretty chilling as well. It doesn't try to put you on a frozen mountain top like a Transilvanian Hunger would, but instead it seems to focus on some of the most minimalistic aspects of metal possible, and it pulls it off flawlessly, even if the result is nothing more than constant fuzz with some occasional drum beats and tortured black metal yelping. I just love the progression of this record, it seemingly drags on forever, but then changes to something that's every bit (if not even more) as beautiful as what came before it. Even during the more black metal-derived material (the title track and \"Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen\") it's just so captivating and gripping, even when it's simple as fuck. There are arguably 2 black metal songs here, but even these songs feel like ambient with a drum pattern supporting them rather than actual black metal songs. You see, this album is so incredibly barebones but somehow so good as a result. It seemingly drones on forever with the fuzz that the guitars produce, only ever so rarely changing pace or tone, but for some reason I can listen to it far longer than most things black metal. There's no other reason for me loving this other than me just loving it.\n\nThe 2 songs that pass the 14-minute barrier are the ones most responsible for this record being so good. Track 1 and 4 are my favorites of this album, presumably because they're the least black metal songs featured here. While this music isn't enchanting or peaceful because it's still moody and relatively dark, it's just beautiful to hear, which says something considering Vikernes' vocals are pretty horrifyingly tortured and insane. There's hardly any technique in what he screams, but my god it fits the music perfectly. He doesn't sound like your ordinary vocalist, he genuinely feels like he's lost in the forest, barely alive while forced to exude and scream whatever he still has left in his already horribly decayed shell of a body. His vocals sound like the helpless screams of a dying man, and that is one of the best vocal styles I could've imagined for an album that already sounds this hopeless on its own, only further solidifying this as one of the best kinda-black metal albums ever made. Funny enough, track 4 is entirely instrumental, but perhaps the best this album has to offer, with an awesome flute section starting around the 9th minute. It's a calm song and pretty sleepy as well, but I like that, a lot. The rest of the album alternates between constant fuzz for a guitar and some pseudo-black metal riffs that are incredibly effective in their simplicity, but the fuzz somehow provides a lot to listen to, even when you barely hear the notes being hit other than the tone shifting. I guess I'm now describing what basically every black metal-based ambient album sounds like, but bear in mind this is the first ever ambient release I've heard in its entirety, but judging by the quality of this release, it's most definitely not going to be the last.\n\nHvis Lyset Tar Oss is the antithesis of what I usually like about metal, but I love it so much only because it's so unique and beautiful. There's no riffs here to remember, and in fact the whole album isn't very memorable, but the experience once you hear it is just so incredibly great. Yes, currently, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is the best album I have heard that has black metal amongst the genres, and for some reason I believe it will stay that for a while. Every self-respecting metalhead should give this a spin at one time in their life.\n",
        "\nVarg Vikernes released his sophomore album 'Det som engang var' under his Burzum moniker in 1993. An excellent record in all ways black metal, but in between his self-titled debut and his second album, an EP was released. With a title like 'Aske' it was bound to stir some shit (you know why), but the EP also stirs some even darker shit than what was heard on Burzum's debut album.\n\n'Aske' features three tracks and opens with \"Stemmen fra t\u00e5rnet\". The lyrics are in Norwegian and along with the music, conjures up something dark and mysterious. It's repetitive, but has got a catchy, melodic riff that is backed by a steady, mid-paced rhythm. Varg's vocals are his usual (in his early days) terrifying banshee shrieks. In addition to the guitar, the bass, the drums and the horrifying wails, there's a subtle use of keys, most prominent just after half the song has played. It adds a sudden twist that replaces the depressive/melancholic atmosphere with a truly menacing one, before the song reverts back to the main riff and suddenly ends.\n\n\"Dominus Sathanas\" is the second track. It's an instrumental track; as in there are no lyrics, but vocals are used to add to the atmosphere. The guitar is, again, melodic, very melancholic, slightly depressive and thus creates a powerful atmosphere, which is what Burzum is all about. The vocals present on this track are brief and do not play a vital part. There's some mumbling while the intro's playing before we hear a scream, which then ends in haunting \"background singing\". Or should I say humming. If I decided to take a long walk in the woods near my home in Finland in the winter, got lost and knew I was going to die, this would be a fitting track.\n\nThe EP ends with a song that I dare call a Burzum classic. \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" is a behemoth track. Clocking in at almost 11 minutes; while still a bit repetitive, is broken up in four parts using two different styles. It starts intensely with pacey riffing and blast-beats before breaking into a long, slow and heavy part that has a doom metal quality to it, but of course, a much rawer and frostbitten black metal production and the howls of a tortured soul make sure that this isn't any traditional doom. The song then briefly goes back to the faster and more black metal'ish sound before once again reverting back to the slower, doomier bit before ending.\n\n'Aske' isn't an amazing release. It can't really compare to 'Burzum', the album, because of the different number of tracks. Sure, the sound is similar, but somehow, I think that Varg has taken a step forward while recording 'Aske', because despite the short length of this EP, it's certainly got the atmospheric quality that makes Burzum so special. Perhaps even better than on the debut. With that said, I can't rate it as highly as I did the debut album, simply because it's an EP that doesn't offer anything completely new. But it certainly is an indicator of where Burzum is going, and that's definitely in the right direction, because in 1993 'Det som engang var', too, was released, which turned out to be an amazing record.\n",
        "\nIf I were to be 100% honest I don't carry any ill will towards this album. I know it's very disliked amongst the metal community, but I don't simply because it struck sort of a nostalgia. It sounds like it could be the soundtrack for an old school sword and magic arcade game, which is strangely something I'm extremely familiar with.\n\nAs far as the sound goes its far clearer and cleaner then the music for most any retro arcade game and miles away from what Varg did with his previous black metal albums. Its very slick and very clean. (Probably because it was generated on a computer and not recorded)\n\nMusically it is very simplistic and very repetitive. Clearly meant to be minimalist. Basically every song is 4 layers. Each layer meant to sound like a stereotypically medieval fantasyesque instrument that plays around 3 different bars (phrases, measures choose your pick of term). Usually done in a specific pattern of bar 1, bar 2, bar 1, bar 3 repeat. The pattern found at the beginning of a song is what is found for its entirety. (Technically a riff is a repeated measure or measures of music so on its simplest definition these would qualify). \n\nYes, a lot of is extremely boring however there are parts that are just beautiful. Granted these are not only repeated over and over again but these melodies, well they sound like someone grabbed a scale and threw a few of its notes together to make it. Childish in a way.\n\nAll of this being said though I found a great use for those who happen to own this album, if you like playing RPGs out of books then you might find this to be an amazing thing to put on the big speakers or surround sound (not too loud mind you) while you play D and D, Mayhem or something of the sort.\n",
        "\nBurzum's self-titled debut album is perhaps the Varg Vikernes' most raw and varied. Varg was ahead of his fellow black metallers in Norway in the early 90s, and it was evident already on his first offering. While Darkthrone and Immortal had a stronger speed/death metal influence a la Bathory, Hellhammer/Celtic Frost, Burzum focused more on the very simplistic, but atmospheric style. Of course, Bathory-ish sonic attacks are evident in songs like \"Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\", \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\", \"My Journey to the Stars\" and of course the song that is dedicated to Bathory called \"War\", which is Burzum's token thrasher, pretty much. But what stands out the most, is the sheer eeriness of songs like \"Black Spell of Destruction\" with its doomy riffing/rhythm, the instrumental tracks; \"Channelling the Power of Souls into a New God\" with its creepy, brooding synth work and \"The Crying Orc\" with its emotional guitar, which is the sole instrument.\n\nThe most obvious difference between Burzum and the other black metal acts at the time, are the vocals. Vikernes doesn't exactly use the witchy-type of vocals, strongly influenced by Bathory (Darkthrone, Immortal and others all adopted this). Instead, Varg uses some very human-sounding vocals, albeit terrifying. His vocals sound like a human being tortured both mentally and physically, and they're downright terrifying. Some people might think they're too much and will be put off by them alone (I was one, once upon a time). But with time, your ears might adjust to them, and if so, you'll notice that they add a certain charm to Burzum's early albums. It's all about the darkness.\n\nVikernes had the ideas as early as here, and while the first albums were all recorded in a very short space of time (a year or so), the progression and musicianship improved gradually on each and every record. This album gives us a very raw and young idea of what is to come from Burzum. With that said, 'Burzum' is the weakest of Vikernes' early classics. It's by no means a weak album; not at all, but it feels like Varg hadn't utilized his excellent vision and ideas properly. He did it well here, very well on 'Det som engang var' and excellently on 'Hvis lyset tar oss' and 'Filosofem'. \n\nI think that 'Burzum' is a monumental record, partially due to Vikernes' notoriety, but musically it's a very different black metal record. He was indeed ahead of his time and would probably become the most influential black metal musician from the 90s era.\n",
        "\nOut of all the major second wave black metal albums, none are as controversial and divisive as Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Legions of metal listeners swear by it as the pinnacle of metal's evolution, a brilliant conceptual work relating the fall of European spiritual values to the false light of Middle Eastern religions. Legions more swear that Varg needs to find a real studio and learn how to play the guitar. However, as the years wear on, the criticism fades, the naysayers find something new to hate, and the monumental scope of this album shines through. As commercial acts like Cradle of Filth now play to a shrinking fan base, Burzum appeals to a new generation of listeners and continues to captivate the imaginations of old fans. \n\nDespite being comprised of relatively simple musical ingredients, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss embodies everything that the original Norwegian black metal movement was building towards, and is one of the rare examples of a contemporary musical style in full bloom of realized potential. In fact, it sets the bar so high that every black metal release to come since feels like child's play. Whether one agrees with Varg's ideals or not, they clearly provided him with enough inspiration to carry his music into uncharted territory.\n\nThe album opens with \"Det Som Engang Var\", one of the most well known songs in black metal. After about four minutes of buildup, the song explodes into a melody that is beautifully simple and instantly recognizable. Keyboards soar above the froth of guitar like icy winds on a desolate mountain, while drums alternate between simple grooves and a booming, reverb-drenched tom beat. By the time it's all over, it's hard to believe that almost fifteen minutes have passed. \n\nThe next two songs are less individually remarkable but no less worthy - both begin with a feedback-heavy fast section that gradually develops into a cryptic, haunting guitar/keyboard melody. They change form so gradually that you don't even notice it happening. A new melody glides in behind a pulsating main riff, then the main riff drops away and your attention is focused on the \"new\" melody that's actually been playing for a while already. Listening to these songs is like being outside as the sun goes down - you don't realize the exact moment when it gets dark, you just notice that all of a sudden it is dark.\n\nCloser \"Tomhet\" is a long piece of ambient electronic that owes much influence to classic Berlin electronic artists like Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream etc. Unlike most of Varg's full-album forays into ambient electronic, \"Tomhet\" is a fully realized piece with a striking, visual climax. It's almost kind of happy sounding, a suggestion of hope after obliteration of consciousness. After the raging storm that is the first 30 minutes, it's a calm and contemplative ending that gives the listener opportunity to reflect and gather their thoughts, completing the gradually descending mood of the album, and departing from the music in a tranquil state.\n\nI should also mention that this album has proved its longevity like few others around. Although I disliked it upon first listen, something about it drew me back and it eventually grew on me. I have listened to this album regularly for over fifteen years, and by now it feels like an old friend. Even though I know every second of playing time, every little curve of the music like the back of my hand, there is still something fresh and new to discover every time I play it. If you want a metal album you can come back to again and again, instead of some disposable release you will listen to three times and forget, seek out this album. Be alone, turn out the lights, and let yourself be absorbed by Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.\n",
        "\nCall it an odd quirk, but my own general ambivalence towards ambient music in general, there is something truly charming about the minimalist sonic pondering that has taken place outside of the black metal genre by the likes of Fenris via Neptune Towers, Ildjarn, Beherit, and the ever infamous Burzum. But in contrast to most, Varg's long-lived project has opted to make a recent stop back in territory that was abandoned by the rest towards the end of the 90s, of which The Ways Of Yore stands as his 4th cumulative outing in the world of pure synthetic instrumentation. Per usual, the well-known ex-con has opted to continue his pursuits of disseminating the lore of Odin and several other aspects of Nordic mythology, though here the formula has been modified a bit into something that is arguably more personal, but also comes with some flaws given the storyteller's limited abilities in certain departments.\n\nOn his previous ambient works, there was always a strongly ethereal character to the keyboard motives at work, though in the case of the lower fidelity midi creation that was Dau\u00f0i Baldrs this was a bit more implicit. Where things start here is a bit more rustic and overtly folksy, opting for a percussive collection of pluck string themes and drum sounds, culminating in the two introductory instrumentals \"God From The Machine\" and \"The Portal\". Comparisons to Renaissance Faire novelty music wouldn't be entirely out of line here, though it doesn't hold as a binding rule for the entirety of the album. Further along into the album the familiar texture of sustained synthetic hazes of sound as heard on Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf appear, albeit with a slightly harder hitting synthesized guitar character, as clearly heard on \"The Lady In The Lake\". This formula tends to trade blows with the earlier covered folksy music, until things eventually melt back into the entirely foggy character of previous endeavors on the longer instrumentals that close things out.\n\nAs mentioned before, while there is a good amount of tantalizing collection of sounds on here for those seeking peaceful contemplation and sleep, this isn't quite a perfect evolution of what was heard out of Varg's previous ambient endeavors. The chief flaw is the incorporation of lyrics through either spoken or sung means. For all of his ability to establish a restful atmosphere, Varg is not possessed of a voice that melds in well with his music, resulting in a jagged, disjointed attempt at a chant song in \"Heill \u00d3\u00f0inn\". At other points his lyrics are spoken, which is a bit less abrasive, but still interferes with the atmosphere. Call it an uncompromising sense of sentimentality, but it's near impossible for me to square the narrative/storybook character of many of these songs with the more abstract approach taken prior. Some things need only be expressed in a title or in the insert notes, some things need no further explanation.\n\nOverall, the good tends to outweigh the bad here, but I can't help but imagine how much better this whole album would flow if Varg axed the narrations and used synthesized choral vocals for the few sung parts found on here. It didn't necessarily have to be an almost complete revisiting of Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf the way the predecessor was, but the best ambient albums are best expressed via what is implied, rather in what is said outright. Nevertheless, the target audience of this album shouldn't be too displeased with the results, as Varg's undying love of his motherland's history and lore translates itself nicely through this medium. Even if Burzum never releases another black metal album, there is still plenty of territory to explore while on the present path, and there seems to be little end to Varg's new found prolific writing streak.\n",
        "\nThe train keeps rolling with new Burzum releases, \u201cThe Ways of Yore\u201d being the sixth full-length (including \u2018compilation\u2019 LP \u201cFrom the Depths of Darkness\u201d) since 2010 following Varg\u2019s release from prison for you-know-what. By and large his \u2019second era\u2019 material has been of a good standard, devoid of the intensity and ill will of earlier Burzum recordings but possessive of their own more relaxed earthly spirit. An excursion into maturity you might say, a journey he had plenty of time to consider through the long years of incarceration. \u201cThe Ways of Yore\u201d thematically continues Varg\u2019s explorations of mythology, folklore and Odalism but musically the departure into acoustic and ambient territories takes the mind back to his late 90\u2019s prison albums, \u201cDau\u00f0i Baldrs\u201d and \u201cHli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\u201d. In spite of that the 13 tracks here (inclusive of two re-recorded versions of older tracks) feature a decent amount of variation, not least in comparison to other black metal acts who have trodden similar paths in recent times, notably October Falls and the upcoming Wolves in the Throne Room record. We have acoustic guitar intermissions, atmospheric effects, slowly monotonous percussion and a variance of clean vocal styles from Varg which provide a warm, humanist vibe to the record, a feeling which may some contradictory given his frenzied path but retains value from a historical perspective.\n\nEarly listens to the album however left me cold and distinctly bored by the closing stages of its 68 minutes as the slow drawl and lack of energy provide ample opportunity for the mind to wander and crave something a bit more, well, like the nihilistic Burzum of old. My own personal appreciation has grown through subsequent listens but I doubt that many out there will be so willing to embrace what at times feels like a personal message from its creator. I would not wish to second guess the underlying intention of the (English) spoken word passages in \u201cHeill Odinn\u201d, \u201cThe Coming of Ettins\u201d, \u201cEk Fellr\u201d, all of which witness Varg orate with his heavy nasal Norwegian accent, but in a similar way to Sabbath Assembly records the simplistic and spacious soundscapes are ripe for the delivery of intuition. The plethora of atmospherics are primarily focussed around individual keyboard strokes with a deep echo reverberating into a dark ether of unpredictability but through any of these it is hard to feel the same attachment as compared to the ambient tracks from previous Burzum records where their more spared usage had a strong effect. I can\u2019t help but feel that much of the depth through these passages comes simply from standard keyboard effects as the inclusion of two rerecorded old tracks featured at the end - \u201cEmptiness\u201d (\u201cTomhet\u201d from \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d) and \u201cTo Hel and Back Again\u201d (\u201cTil Hel og Tilbake Igjen\" from \u201cFallen\u201d) which consume 23 minutes of the running time - show themselves to have a greater depth and mystery through their gentle melodic sweepings. Whether down to a more prolonged exposure to their wares down the years or through the space of this album, they end up highlighting that too little of \u201cThe Ways of Yore\u201d possesses the hooks for instant gratification nor lingers in the memory long beyond the finish. I appreciate \u201cThe Ways of Yore\u201d as a representation of Burzum\u2019s variations in the past few years but I cannot see how many fans of the man\u2019s fabled back catalogue will be too enamoured by this.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nBurzum is the name of the band of artist Varg Vikernes. He is considered a legendary black metal artist. He is widely known for his controversy surrounding the burning of multiple churches in Norway related to the underground black metal scene. He is also known for the slaying of Euronymous, who played with him on Mayhem\u2019s magnum opus, \u201cDe Mysterious Dom Sathanas\u201d. Much controversy has also surrounded him regarding his beliefs. Despite having so much controversy, he is respected by many in the second wave of black metal fandom. He is also one of the pioneers of the style. \n\nWhen listening to this album a multitude of ideas come to mind. The thought of walking down a beaten path in the middle of the night, hearing the whisper of the wind against the trees in the cold comes to my mind vividly. I also envision the album cover art during a lot of the music. Vikernes has the ability to produce music that makes you think of the night. The music is so dark, but at the same time it\u2019s beautiful. Listening to this album in a completely dark room will be sure to cause an out of body experience, especially when it gets to the first ambient track. The riffs have a primitive sound that helps to encompass the archaic feel this album has. Feeble Screams From the Forests Unknown is a great example of this primitive movement in the riffs. The melodies themselves create a sinister atmosphere. They could literally sound dark played on a xylophone. Vikernes possesses the ability to do this well. It\u2019s what black metal is all about, after all. \n\nThe guitar-work album features tremolo picked riffs with minor chord arpeggio riffs. The guitar isn't necessarily technical, but he definitely knows how to play the instrument. The guitar tone itself is rough, abrasive, and on the lower end of production quality. This all helps add to the atmospheric qualities of it. The guitar features heavy distortion, but there is no problem hearing the haunting melodies that exude from the axe. He is a master of crafting melodic lines that are stirring and unsettling, while still holding your attention with catchiness. Just listen to the dooming (mental) breakdown that happens during the first three minutes of Feeble Screams From the Forests Unknown. \n\nSomething else notable about this album is the vocal performance. Varg sounds like he\u2019s being tortured while he was recording. Nattram from Silencer should have taken notes from this album before he tried doing, \u201cDeath - Pierce Me.\u201d His vocals pierce over the top of the low bass and distorted guitars. Burzum does a great job of balancing his vocal aggressiveness with the guitar. The two never really compete with each other, and go well together. For a good example of this, check out, \u201cEa, Lord of the Depths.\u201d They really complement each other here. His mournful, dark, and animalistic vocals go great with the guitar line, especially on the main hook. \n\nBurzum is definitely a second wave black metal gem. I\u2019d say it\u2019s an essential listen for anyone serious about black metal. It\u2019s best listened to in darkness. After all, that\u2019s what the name \u201cBurzum\u201d means. I\u2019d say this is the type of release you shouldn't judge after one listen. It takes a few times to truly hear what the album has to offer.\n",
        "\nA priori I can define this album by saying that it continues the trend of the previous one but being more folk-oriented. It is still ambient and has again that windy synth sounds all over the record. Tracks like The Portal or Hall of the Fallen are instant winners, the ones that stand out at the very first listen. The former because of its catchy melody and those chaotic electronics intermingled. The latter because of the strange sounds that can be heard and which reminded me of icelendic band Sigur R\u00f3s.\n\nOne of the things that caught my attention is that Varg makes use of vocals sung in a folky way. The point is, does he really do them better than the ones who already do them? The answer is no. I'd rather listen to Denez Prigent, Dead Can Dance, Arcana or Daemonia Nymphe to get that kind of vocals properly done. This is partly because Varg's voice and his ability to sing is just average at best. Here the vocals sound muddy and nasal, so probably there's also a bad production issue added to that previous problem. Ek Fellr is an example of a beautiful tune ruined because of way the vocals are done/recorded/mixed.\n\nBut the vocals on this record are not limited to sung ones. There are also passages of spoken words. I didn't like it when Varg used them in his last metal offering Umskiptar. In this album they are even worse because although he speaks in English here, I still can't understand most of what he's saying. The Reckoning of Man showcases the best use of the spoken vocals on this recording. Besides that, this track is awfully depressing, reminding me of old Burzum tunes like Illa Ti\u00f0andi, and I still don't know if it's a good thing or not.\n\nThere are some surprises by the end of the album. For example in the titletrack you can hear some kind of electric guitar with distortion, but it is hard to tell if it's in fact a guitar or just a VSTi. This is also used in which is probably the best track on this recording, Autumn Leaves. Out of curiosity I would like to know if the title means that autumn is leaving, or leaves is intended to mean the plural of leaf. Probably the meaning is double here. Anyway, it is well composed as each layer of sound that appears is always adding something to the atmosphere that is very much nostalgic in a good way. Post-black metal bands like Alcest comes to my mind.\n\nAnother noticeable thing is that this album features is the remake of Tomhet, here called just by its English translation, Emptiness. Although in my opinion is not as good as the old version, it's still a good listen in a different way because of all that new percussion added and a cleaner production.\n\nSo I'm giving this release an 80 rating because it is the number of swastikas on the cover. Just kidding. In fact I think is a pretty good album but with some flaws (mainly vocals) and it doesn't flow as well as the previous offering S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan, making it less trippy and more focused on individual tracks. But it still makes a good journey to listen to this.\n",
        "\nI had initially described this album to a friend as 'music one might hear over a loudspeaker at a Renaissance Fair while smoking a cigarette and waiting to use the privy trailer out near the parking lot', and I'm largely sticking with that assertion. But I do feel like some might take that to imply that I hated what I was listening to, and I want to state that this is not the case. Granted, I'm not entirely sold on the experience, but The Ways of Yore, Varg Vikernes' fourth purely ambient/folk album under the Burzum brand, is a step above its predecessor in terms of structure and quality, with more going on, at least in the limited aesthetic range the Count is messing about with. Hell, I like it slightly more than Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, thought it can't really compare with the charming, cheesy MIDI dungeon synth grandeur of Dau\u00f0i Baldrs.\n\nVikernes returns partially to the well of inspiration which produced the lackluster S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan, in that he often implements some of the same, simmering synth sounds which dragged that monotonous 80s New Age paean into frustration. Yet on the whole, there are a lot more fluctuating, folksy ingredients, like the string sounds captured against the keyboards, or the droning, deep and often goofy Norse vocals. There are even some electrified guitar sounds incorporated with some effects, like in the title cut, which function beautifully with the repetition of the simple percussive programming and modest synth tones. Strangely enough, I actually found the tunes which Varg was narrating to be the most compelling and meditative. Say what you will about the man, love or hate him (as he is won to do towards you), but the guy's accent is quite distinct when speaking English, so hearing his style of storytelling over the base repetition of the instruments makes for some degree of authenticity that I found lacking last time, due to the severely limited sound-set and design. I'd also add that The Ways of Yore is marginally more complex, if only because it involves string lines with more notes, and I feel that's a positive move if he's going to continue in this vein...\n\nInitial reactions were not strong, and in the end I don't consider it all that great of a listen, but it does succeed in providing an hour of atavistic escapism. I listened to it several times while walking my six-month old in his stroller on some cooler late spring mornings, and found it was adequate enough background music even though few of the note patterns truly weave themselves into your memory. The folksy guitar-like parts seem like the sort of stuff you'd hear in a tavern on a computer RPG, and a few of the synth lines seem too redundant of the prior full-length, but the first 10-11 tunes go by with few distractions and some solidarity in concept and direction. A tranquil, undemanding sort of experience which is likely to suffer from the massive bias against its creator, but if you view it for what it actually is, I wasn't ultimately too turned off. Are there a hundred neo-folk, New Age or dark ambient bands who perform this better than Burzum? Yes, of course, but you have to admit that Vikernes' obsessions with European history and ancient cultural ideology fit like a hand to a glove with this musical medium, so it makes a lot of sense that he's chosen this path.\n\nI do find the re-recordings of \"Tomhet (Emptiness)\" and \"Til Hel og tilbake igjen (To Hel and Back Again)\" to be needless chaff tacked on here, which might not 'interrupt' the flow of the newer material, but does not at all complement it. Consider that these two pieces alone are bloating out the album by 24 minutes! I would have preferred that this just stopped on \"Autumn Leaves\", but the unnecessary length is really my biggest concern. \"Emptiness\" has more or less been tweaked with the same sound set found elsewhere on this and the prior album, so whether you will like it or not really depends on your reaction to this new phase of his career. \"To Hel...\" is much the same, but I felt like the bass-range synthesizers worked well with in tandem with those scintillating electric melodies and the lighter, piano-like textures and repetitions, so this one wasn't much of a bust. Their inclusion almost seems like fan service...but for whom? These aside, though, The Ways of Yore was not an album I really minded, and might be something I break out again in the Fall to see how it syncs up with the seasonal New England atmosphere. But it's not so strong, either, and even after a matter of hours I find that I forget anything about it but the general audio cues and impressions. Now to get back in queue for that toilet.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIn all honesty, this record should not be getting a review on Metal Archives. The reason why is obvious - it isn't metal. However I have decided to take the opportunity to post my thoughts, and therefore hopefully counterbalance the somewhat unwarranted exposure this record will get within the realm of ambient electronica. \n\nFirst up, I'd like to state that this is not an offensively bad record by any means. There are some good moments on here, especially Autumn Leaves, in which the gently cosmic keyboard tones are augmented by a simple yet evocative acoustic guitar and bass pattern, and then later with one of the rare examples of distorted guitar utilised on the record. This augmentation works well because it draws the ear away from the silence behind the sparse rhythms which infuses the record. So many of the tracks suffer because dynamically speaking, they offer little, while musically speaking their reductionism draws attention to the fact that what is on show is often just not very interesting. \n\nVikernes' prison material Dau\u00f0i Baldrs saw primitive keyboard work allied to the occasional equally primitive percussive element. While his early explorations in this new style were restricted in scope for obvious reasons, in the intervening years there has been a disappointing lack of progress in his electronic work. The keyboard elements are more polished and evocative of a 'cosmic' atmosphere, but are noticeably simple and fairly repetitive. These loops of more atmospheric synth are joined with simple piano-like tones in a format which is repeated more or less for the entirely of the record. Again, pleasant enough but not that interesting. \n\nOne of the weak points of the record are the vocals of Varg. On Heil Odinn he produces a murmured attempt at singing that, while raw and honest enough, demonstrates a lack of melodious quality and strength that reduces its impact. On Lady In The Lake, he tries a spoken type of vocal style. Again, for all his many qualities, I don't believe his spoken voice , which is given a kind of hand-over-the-mouth muffled treatment, is particularly compelling. The Coming Of Ettins begins with the already familiar swathes of cosmic keyboard, before more chatter from Varg. Once again, these hushed tones are muffled in an inexpert fashion and placed in the mix in an uninteresting way. Simply put I just didn't find the style he adopts adds anything to the sense of mythic lore he is attempting to capture. The Reckoning Of Man follows this template once more - keyboard nurdle and spacey synths, the Count speaking another passage in English. At least he uses a tiny bit of reverb effect this time. If there is any great poetry to his lyrics I cannot say, for I found the spoken word fairly hard to follow. On Heil Freya we are once again 'treated' to Vikernes singing, as he attempts to introduce a ritualistic quality to proceedings. His singing is once again fairly tuneless and uninspiring. Ek Fellr (I Am Falling) is another opportunity to showcase his somewhat tremulous warblings. I admire him for attempting to introduce this element but unfortunately his lack of tunefulness acts as a barrier to the attempt to evoke a sacred, ritual atmosphere.\n\nIn summary I'd say that although there are some nice moments of contemplative ambience, and Varg certainly has a reverence for the material which shines through, the repetitive dynamic and predictability of the record makes it unlikely to be one which I revisit too often. Most of the tracks follow a formula that relies heavily upon the swathes of spacey keyboard, which unfortunately start to sound very similar to one another, thereby reducing their impact in invoking a dreamlike atmosphere. I'd like to have heard more of the acoustic guitar which works so well on Autumn Leaves. He has obviously improved his playing no end over the years and I think greater use of the guitar would take some of the emphasis away from the keyboards which become rather boring by the final track. The greatest failing though is with the vocals, as mentioned at great length here. Simply put they are not strong enough to warrant such prominence within such a sparse sound field, and the man cannot sing to a degree that makes him compelling. If he had managed to find another person to sing many of these tracks would have been improved greatly, and he could have concentrated upon expanding the atmospheric element of his work. \n\nSo there's some hope Vikernes may eventually come to fully realise his atmospheric vision, but this record, while an honest attempt, will only garner interest because of the use of the Burzum moniker, and not because it stands out in the densely populated field of dark ambient electronica. Anyone wishing to hear a superbly realised example of ethno-ambient soundscapes could do worse than checking out the solo work of Karl Sanders.\n",
        "\nSometimes I have to wonder if Burzum is known for the shenanigans of the mastermind behind it or for the music. No offense to Varg, but he sure made a lot of waves in his youth with his escapades and while I do not contest the value of his early works, I still do wonder if he got known and appreciated through them. Mayhem had a similar fate, getting known through the imagery and the extreme stupidity of some of the band members instead of their musical endeavours, a bad thing since Mayhem is probably the most original out of all old school black metal bands managing to do not sound the same album after album.\n\nAfter 15 years of prison, Varg Vikernes releases Belus, a much anticipated album by a fan-base eager to listen to a proper follow-up to Filosofem after two mediocre to disappointing ambient albums (I'll give him credit for the lack of logistics in prison). Both Belus and Fallen were good, musicaly wise (except for Varg's vocals), retaining much of the elements from the early Burzum albums (though with a better production quality) but Umskiptar already started to raise some question marks regarding Varg's ability to create musical quality rather than quantity (3 albums in 3 years). While not bad, Umskiptar had some flaws that made the overall experience tiresome like the length being one of the main problems, Varg's vocal performance and some inconsistencies in terms of song-writing.\n\nS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is Varg's practical statement that his business with the black metal scene is over. He made the statement before releasing this work, and he partially confirmed it after releasing it. But people made one huge mistake when they labeled this work as a natural continuation of the last ambient album Burzum released. No folks, the music is indeed ambient, but what this one lacks when compared with the previous two dark ambient albums is the medieval atmosphere (well not completely, but is much less used here than in the previous two).\n\nThe new Burzum offering is entirely instrumental, partly because it also represents the soundtrack of a movie done by Varg's wife, Marie Cachet. It contains almost an hour of audible experience, separated in 11 songs, all of them though should be taken as a whole and not separately. There is no song that detaches itself from the rest of the tracks, all of them flow naturaly in an equal manner and at best, you can find moments of sheer delight, relaxing tunes and fortunately, it does not lack variety. The ambient passages are for the most part inspired ones, but they may seem drag on, especially for those that do not have the patience to fully experience an ambient work. One of the mistakes the metal community makes is that it considered that Varg has pretty much left the metal influences behind. He indeed left the metal scene but he still retains that grim, dark atmosphere that made Burzum inspire a whole palette of black metal bands that rely on atmosphere, rather than sheer brutality and rawness. Put some metal riffs and some drumming here, and you would have the same old Burzum.\n\nOne thing Varg never attained nor in the past, nor with this offering, is to be memorable. Varg just cannot find his own style and identity with this sound, with this music, with this genre as a whole. He found it on Filosofem while he did not bid farewell to black metal (even though by the black metal standards from back then, that was surely a departure). While S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan has some moments of genius, especially in the opening part of the album, all just fades away fast making you think that Varg just messed up with the keyboard thinking that a cool sound might just drop from the sky. I am just glad that he still uses a variety of instruments other than keyboards. S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan features acoustic pasages and some scarce bass line, but the predominantly used instrument remains the keyboard. Lack of inspiration is also clear in the last couple of songs where variety is replaced by repetitiveness.\n\nTo conclude, asking me to point out a song from this record is a tough job. \"R\u00fbnar munt \u00fe\u00fb finna\" is a representative song for this incarnation of Burzum, but I would advice all of you that are willing to give this album a chance to listen to it as a whole and then pass judgement. If you don't like it, just stop listening. If you do love Burzum for the black metal works, other than the atmospheric aspects of the music, you won't find anything metal here. I do have to admit that dark ambient music has always suffered from relentless criticism from metal fans, especially if a band is known for other works rather than its ambiental outputs. Burzum is one of them. This album, while it is not a hidden gem, and is far from being relevant to the genre, has some good moments. It is a love it or hate it album, a hit or miss, a gamble to be more precise. Probably out of 10 listeners, if 1 can see it for what it is, that is commendable. But in the end, both Burzum and this album were not made to appeal to the masses. And certainly, Varg, first and foremost, writes music that he himself likes, not music that the public wants. Only time will tell if Varg was a genius when he decided to walk this path, or if it was just another failure.\n",
        "\nIs Varg even trying anymore? Look, I understand the fact that Belus was never meant to be the most energetic, high octane release of all time but I really can\u2019t justify just how oppressively still this music is. I love Burzum\u2019s earliest release, but Belus seems to discard all of the elements that made his past works so great in favor of very long and droning songs that go absolutely nowhere. \n\nAtmosphere has and always will be (at least to me) the most important aspect of black metal. Burzum\u2019s previous albums were some of the most atmospheric pieces of music my ears have heard and thus resulted in albums that could only be aptly described as masterpieces. However, Belus explores atmosphere in a different direction. The music has been drawn out a lot more, there\u2019s far less memorable riffs and a whole lot of repetition. It seems that Varg was moving in a more modern take of atmospheric black metal, one with heavy repetition and minimalistic compositions. But alas, Varg is not Wolves in the Throne Room and his attempts at droning black metal leave a lot to be desired. Previous attempts at long, droning hymns worked wonders for Varg, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem were absolutely incredibly albums that worked well with their minimalistic nature. Belus unfortunately goes absolutely nowhere and spends a whole lot of time getting there. Songs are both meandering yet ridiculously still (yes that can happen.) There are really no solid ideas on Belus, yet Varg spends a heck of a lot of time exploring each simple, trivial element.\n\nBelus is just really languid, almost unbearably so. After the album has finished I\u2019m left scratching my head trying to remember a single riff, or any of the music for that matter. The whole album just passes me by without leaving much of an impression, and I can safely say this is the most boring album of Varg\u2019s I've heard. There\u2019s no real desire to harken back to his heydays, I respect that Varg wants to explore new grounds, but really, Belus is as far removed from early Burzum as one can get. Gone are the powerful battle cries of yore, gone are the effective use of cheesy ambient synthesizers, gone are the riffs that elicited an atmosphere of somber darkness. Heck, this album has none of the elements that made Burzum so great in the first place, and for that reason alone I recommend you skip it.\n\nHowever, as a comeback album of sorts, one half of me can appreciate what Varg was going for. He wants to leave his black metal past behind and Belus follows a natural evolution of his musical preferences. There\u2019s still plenty of black metal here but not in the traditional sense. It seems that Varg was far more interested in exploring the atmosphere and emotion created from music rather than how it actually sounds, or how it fits into a black metal base plate. The album as a whole sounds rather somber, atmospherically it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s nothing special but there\u2019s a lot of worse stuff out here. Some of the twinkling guitar lines work well and at times, the droning, apathetic direction can occasionally succeed. \n\nThere\u2019s certainly an atmosphere, one that\u2019s very dreary and dismal, but they\u2019re pretty low down on the emotional hierarchy in terms of intensity. Yes, it\u2019s atmospheric, but it\u2019s not really interesting. The somber, dreary atmosphere never lets up for the whole album, and whilst some might see this as a plus, I for one need something a little more intense in terms of emotive expression. The vocals don\u2019t help matters easy, with Varg sounding really tired, worn out and willing to collapse at any moment. \n\nIn the past, Varg was able to transport me to another realm, whilst here he just leaves me bored and uninterested. The flight is listenable but wholly directionless, the music retains an atmosphere of such dreariness that it borders on the apathetic. At moments, Varg attempts to add life into the music with a couple of more up tempo passages that appear through the album. However, these sections are quickly counteracted by really long and droning music that just doesn't go anywhere. However, this is not a bad album, just average and there\u2019s nothing in the music to get either excited or upset about. It\u2019s just there.\n",
        "\nReviewing Burzum is never easy\u2026 I have a feeling like people judge Varg and band more for his deeds, beliefs and views \u2013 which sure, are controversial, but who cares \u2013 more than for his music. But isn\u2019t the music the most important here? I must admit that, despite being who he is, Varg was and still is very talented musician. Or I would better say black metal / ambient composer, because he\u2019s not very skilled instrumentalist, his playing is sometimes just primitive, but the atmosphere and special feeling, which he creates in his music are things, which make Burzum so special. In the early period of Burzum existence Vickernes composed many awesome songs\u2026 some has been featured on his debut LP \u201cBurzum\u201d and MLP \u201cAske\u201d and just few months after releasing these two \u201cDet som engang var\u201d sees the light of the fullmoon and I personally must say that from all these three releases this one is my favourite. It\u2019s not perfect, and also it is not my personal favourite in the whole Burzum discography, but certainly it is very good album and I like it more than the debut. \u201cDet som engang var\u201d has actually been recorded even before \u201cAske\u201d, but the EP was released first, which is kind of weird... It was all because Varg didn\u2019t want to give his second full length album to Deathlike Silence anymore, so he waited and finally released it through his own label Cymophane Records. He also wanted to release \u201cAske\u201d by himself, but got arrested at that time, so DSP released it. Originally \u201cDet som engang var\u201d was released only on CD limited to 950 copies. I don\u2019t need to remind you how expensive this pressing is. I am happy to have just a 2005\u2019s Back on Black vinyl edition of it.\n\nWhen comparing \u201cDet som engang var\u201d (what stands for \u201cWhat Once Was\u201d) to the previous efforts I can easily say that the music has progressed and overall it is better composed and recorded album. But the atmosphere and feeling of the music is pretty much intact and it is a right continuation of the debut. The album is opened with very calm and silent keyboard intro \u201cDen Onde Kysten\u201d, which sets the right mood and then \u201cKey to the Gate\u201d begins\u2026 it is very rough and relatively fast black metal song, with Varg screaming in it like possessed. I like how it (this song) develops and in the slower part there\u2019s one riff and motif, which I love especially \u2013 the one when guitar lead appears. It is amazing. Surprisingly the music turns into quite melodic, almost kind of doomy at some point, but I really like it a lot, for me it is the best moment of the whole album. \u201cEn Ring Til \u00c5 Herske\u201d continues with this kind of dark and epic black metal, with unexpected use of clean vocals mixed with the shrieking howls and the mood is kind of hypnotising and truly dark, cold and grim. Wow, I must say that three songs from the beginning and it can already be heard how varied the music on \u201cDet som engang var\u201d is. And later on it goes through even more diverse stuff \u2013 starting off with excellent \u201cDark Wisdom\u201d, which belongs to the most known Burzum songs I guess and then we have \u2013 just like on the debut LP \u2013 a bunch of instrumental tracks. But while on \u201cBurzum\u201d they were sometimes pretty useless, here on \u201cDet som engang var\u201d they really complete the atmosphere and feel like a part of the concept, not just something what was thrown in by accident (and on debut LP I felt like that, definitely, and not only with the instrumental songs, but especially with so mismatched song as \u201cWar\u201d). Ambient track like \u201cHan som Reiste\u201d sounds really damn well, in my opinion and is kind of dark ambient, which I like to listen to \u2013 you know, something similar to Mortiis, Wongraven\u2026 It is side B of the vinyl, which is especially filled with instrumental songs, creating this almost dreamy atmosphere\u2026 but it is abruptly distorted and disrupted by \u201cSnu Mikrokosmos Tegn\u201d, a nine minutes long black metal anthem, again quite varied, as there are both fast and chaotic parts as well as more melancholic and melodic themes.\n\nHeading towards the end of this review I can only add that \u201cDet som engang var\u201d is just a classic black metal record. I do realize that Norway back in those days was releasing a lot of killer, cult albums and they all deserve attention\u2026 and maybe among them all this second Burzum full length is not my favourite, with the debuts from Immortal, Enslaved or Darkthrone\u2019s \u201cUnder the Funeral Moon\u201d being ranked slightly higher, but it is very good LP anyway. I like how Burzum\u2019s music has been evolving and obviously I just cannot resist to the way Vickernes has been creating this feeling and mood in his music, which are just possessing and trance like. \u201cDet som engang var\u201d is a mandatory album in everyone\u2019s collection and I trust everyone has his own copy. And look at that front artwork by Jannicke Wiese-Hansen! Wow.\nStandout tracks: \u201cKey to the Gate\u201d, \u201cEn Ring Til \u00c5 Herske\u201d, \u201cHan som Reiste\u201d, \u201cDark Wisdom\u201d\nFinal rate: 87/100\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026worship me\u2026\u201d\nBurzum and Varg Vickernes\u2026 Everybody has his own opinion on this guy, his views (religious and especially political), his deeds and his music; some hate him, some worship him, but no one is careless. Personally I don\u2019t really follow Grishnackh\u2019s opinions and ideas, but I do have deep respect for this guy for standing behind his views and visions for so many years and not giving up. Even if he meets so many problems (like recently with the French police) he still says what he thinks and beliefs in \u2013 and for that I can only respect and even admire Varg. As for the music of Burzum \u2013 well, there are some LPs like \u201cFilosofem\u201d and \u201cHvis lyset tar oss\u201d, which are pure masterpieces, but at the same time I must admit that I never really followed the ambient era Burzum and do not care much about \u201cDaudi Baldrs\u201d or whatever\u2026 And obviously there are also the two now legendary debut releases from Deathlike Silence \u2013 \u201cBurzum\u201d LP and \u201cAske\u201d MLP. Well, the thing with these two recordings is that back in the 90\u2019s I only had them on cassette and later they became so bloody expensive (on vinyl especially) that I didn\u2019t bother to get them on the two original versions. And nowadays it\u2019s too easy to get fucked with some worthless Greek bootleg versions, which some fuckers released to earn easy money, so again I am not bothered about these two LPs (they even made these bootlegs look like the legendary Deathlike Silence editions). Well, for that they\u2019ll surely get impaled on the unholy cock of jesus the jew \u2013 as this is the only faith they deserve\u2026 but where am I going with all this? Well, I just try to say that while the separate first press vinyls of \u201cBurzum\u201d and \u201cAske\u201d are so expensive and risky, then I am just happy to have them on this 2005 Back On Black vinyl version, where both recordings have been compiled on a double vinyl. OK, for some collectors this version may be as worthless as the Greek bootleg, but honestly I don\u2019t care\u2026 at least this is an official release, I didn\u2019t have to pay too much for it back in 2005 and more so, I also didn\u2019t make one Greek asshole more reach. All positives\u2026\n\nBut there\u2019re couple of things, which I don\u2019t like about this Back on Black edition of \u201cBurzum / Aske\u201d. First and foremost, I hate the fact that they dropped the \u201cBurzum\u201d version of \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u201d on it, leaving only the version originally featured on \u201cAske\u201d. This obviously makes this vinyl very incomplete and it is something what should have been done differently in my opinion\u2026 Also the fact that the layout for the LP hasn\u2019t got the \u201cAske\u201d famous cover of burnt church (it only can be slightly seen under the lyrics in the inlay card) nor any of the early 90\u2019s Vickernes\u2019 photos is also something what I would change personally. Other than that the vinyl is released well enough, plays fantastically and is all good. And I do love that original artwork of \u201cBurzum\u201d LP \u2013 even if it has been taken directly from \"Dungeons & Dragons - The Temple of Elemental Evil\" (just as the artwork for \u201cDet som engang var\u201d) \u2013 it looks awesome on vinyl format.\n\nMusically both \u201cBurzum\u201d and \u201cAske\u201d are not my favourite Burzum releases, but for sure I like them \u2013 for both their musical and historical values. The biggest problem with \u201cBurzum\u201d is that the album is very uneven and together with some exceptionally brilliant songs like \u201cFeeble Screams from Forests Unknown\u201d and \u201cEa, Lord of the Depths\u201d it also contains some useless fillers and songs, which simply don\u2019t match the quality of the songs which I have just mentioned. I\u2019m talking about such \u201cWar\u201d, which is a song similar to Bathory\u2019s \u201cBathory\u201d and early Mayhem, but it\u2019s just nothing truly special\u2026 Or let me put it this way \u2013 musically and atmosphere wise it just doesn\u2019t fit to rest of the album, in my opinion. And then we have such \u201cThe Crying Orc\u201d (what a hilarious title\u2026 what was he thinking?) and \u201cDungeons of Darkness\u201d \u2013 which both are simply fillers, which I consider to be utterly useless\u2026 Yeah, \u201cBurzum\u201d doesn\u2019t have the flow and doesn\u2019t hold the same quality, feeling and atmosphere through its entire tracklist and too often everything is interrupted by such forgettable songs. I would be OK if it only had \u201cChannelling the Power of Souls into a New God\u201d, which is actually really nice dark ambient song (or intro, whatever you call it). But more such songs are just a little bit too much for me. \n\nI think that this album will still be pretty unlistenable for many, due to its utterly harsh, primitive and obscure production and playing\u2026 and more so, due to the agonizing screams of Varg, who sounds like possessed, tortured person. But once you get into the sound and style of Burzum\u2019s music you will like its feeling, that cold and inhuman atmosphere and catch some really awesome riffs. Like that opening theme for \u201cEa, Lord of the Depths\u201d \u2013 OK, the drumming may not be the most impressive (to say at least hehe), but that riff is just killer! And there are more great songs like \u201cSpell of Destruction\u201d (when I listen to it now, I can see where Behemoth took their main influences from when recording \u201cReturn of the Northern Moon\u201d demo hehe) \u2013 which is a great epic song and \u201cMy Journey to the Stars\u201d. Yeah, I do love all these songs I mentioned, although the best Burzum recordings were yet to come with \u201cFilosofem\u201d and \u201cHvis lyset tar oss\u201d.\n\nAnd as for \u201cAske\u201d\u2026 It contains just three anthems: \u201cStemmen fra t\u00e5rnet\u201d, \u201cDominus Sathanas\u201d (yet another instrumental\u2026) and new version of \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u201d. And well, this may be the least interesting recording of all, which Burzum did in the early 90s. \u201cStemmen fra t\u00e5rnet\u201d is OK, but nothing more than that and \u201cDominus Sathanas\u201d is as useless as the song about crying orc. \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u201d is the only really worthy song from \u201cAske\u201d - even if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been necessary to re-record it for the MLP, when it has already been perfectly played on \u201cBurzum\u201d. Anyway, summing everything up \u2013 \u201cBurzum / Aske\u201d is not my favourite piece of Norwegian black metal; I prefer some other albums much, much more\u2026 but for sure \u201cBurzum / Aske\u201d is also worth a lot; for both historical and musical matters. I cannot imagine a black metal maniac without having this album in his collection.\nStandout tracks: \u201cEa, Lord of the Depths\u201d, \u201cFeeble Screams from Forests Unknown\u201d, \u201cMy Journey to the Stars\u201d\nFinal rate: 80/100\n",
        "\nBurzum. A household name within the black metal scene. Regardless of your stance towards the man or the music it is fair to say that there are the good and the bad (and even the ugly) when it comes to ol\u2019 Varg\u2019s material. Long gone is the day of the self-titled glory but here we have come to the so-called comeback. Belus. Would a flopback be more appropriate? I don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t think that it lives up to the hype that it inspired.\n\nWe start off with an introduction track. One, might I say, that is completely unnecessary and frankly quite boring. It does not draw you towards or into anything. Other than wondering what that it is that is making the sound. My guess is catching a small wooden ball in a tin cup. After that nonsense \u201cBelus\u2019 D\u00f8d\u201d abruptly begins. With a small noodly guitar lead - which is probably the most intricate thing on the entire album \u2013 which then shifts to about what I believe to be the only riff in the song. Just about every other song follows in the same suit of the same riff being played over and over again. Sunn O))) has more diversity. \n\n\u201cGlemselens Elv\u201d finds itself to have a better composition. I guess that\u2019s because people would notice something a bit odd with the same riff being played for 11 minutes. The fourth track of the album has an attempt at dissonant riffing at the beginning. While I am a great fan of dissonant progressions I do not feel the same with this. It feels awkward and rushed. There is, however, a punk-ish element within the choruses, and for this reason it is redeeming. It brings something new to the table rather than the old worn out sound of that which did precede. \n\nThere is one standout on this album alone, and that would be that which is titled \u201cSverddans\u201d. A two-minute length song with a strong punk presence and manages to bring some life into this otherwise dull, drab and dragged-out album. \u201cKeliohesten\u201d would manage to also freshen up your listening experience if it actually managed to have some more (yes, you guess it) diversity. With what is left of the album; you might as well be better off going to sleep than want to pay attention.\n\nTo finish; while this is in no-way the worst release under the Burzum-moniker. There is definitely more to be desired. But I guess I was not surprised with this as to when most of Burzum\u2019s other works are equally boring. If you are looking for some decent Burzum; do not stop here and go directly back to the self-titled. But boy were I glad when this stopped.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s little I can add to all that has been said about this man and this musical project that has lasted for over 20 years now, despite all the adverse circumstances we\u2019re all well aware of, and that Varg himself had had coming in the first place. After being in jail for such a long time, apparently now he\u2019s in conditions to release an album per year, something many of his fans had been having wet-dreamt of for a long, long time.\n\nPersonally, if not a fan, I\u2019ve deeply enjoyed ALL Burzum\u2019s works, and I mean every single one of\u2019em. It\u2019s true, if anyone liked \u201cBurzum\u201d from 1992, don\u2019t they take for granted \u201cFilosofem\u201d is their kind of shit, and I wouldn\u2019t even need to explain why \u201cDau\u00f0i Baldrs\u201d was meant for a very different kind of audience. Check them out if you haven\u2019t, they all rock and hard. Ignore the lyrics if you happen to be a proficient speaker (listener, understander) of Norwegian language, and unless you\u2019re a Neo-Nazi wotanist or something. No offense there.\n\nSomething I caught a glimpse of when listening to \u201cBelus\u201d, and now I\u2019m positive of, is that strictly with regard to the musical aspect \u201cUmskiptar\u201d is third in a series that started out precisely with \u201cFilosofem\u201d, skipped a couple releases and continued with \u201cBelus\u201d, and that again jumped to our days to keep making us go trippy with the record I\u2019m writing on at the moment. You may say I\u2019m being delusional, yet there are plenty of common elements in the three of them that support such a statement.\n\nAt this moment, dear reader \u2013 yes, I\u2019m addressing you directly, you could go and get a glass of your fave liquor, for I\u2019m about to start. Thank you.\n\nWhat is there to be found here? Atmosphere. That\u2019s all \u201cUmskiptar\u201d is about, creating a thick dream-like atmosphere. And no, the way I see it, you won\u2019t have nightmares after listening to it. As decades have passed, Vikernes has refined his sound up to the point he doesn\u2019t need to produce in you a scary feeling to have a terrific huge effect. And don\u2019t you be mistaken, the word atmospheric doesn\u2019t always mean overuse of keyboards nor lame weak guitar playing. Thick I said, THICK, godamnit!\n\nBeing sort of a musician, one of the mandatory check points for any piece of music to be judged is songwriting, and more specifically, the way the such called composer manages the themes and leitmotifs. In that department, good ol\u2019Varg has become a fucken master. For me, there\u2019s a precious balance among the part every instrument carries, and that includes vocals, you know. Songwriting is flawless song after song, and that\u2019s that.\n\nI\u2019m starting to believe it\u2019s just me, but again I felt as if, although each one of the songs is great by themselves, the album works as a whole piece, rather than a compilation of tracks as it usually happens with non-conceptual records. Truth be told, I could listen to this beast all day long once and again without doing absolutely anything but being in a trance state, trying to figure out if its fury or profundity the idea behind it.\n\nSomething that I think might come to your mind when reading this is \u201catmospheric equals boring\u201c. First of all, let\u2019s remember it\u2019s black metal were talking about, so yes, for the lovers of the genre there\u2019s gonna be enough to praise; and second, the thickness I\u2019ve been mentioning once and again, is perfectly well grounded and solidly built out of a perfect knitting of consistent guitar and bass riffs, appropriate drums playing and SOME keyboards every now and then, all this providing a rich and stable base for Varg to almost pray along during an hour or so.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been reading so far, at this time you know, YOU KNOW I loved listening to \u201cUmskiptar\u201d. It makes great trippy listening, and no wonder this will be in the Class6(66) ASAP. After the mediocre album \u201cFallen\u201d was, this feels like a new breath, and every fan should joy. Grab all the miserable coins you\u2019ve got and go get it next 21st.\n\nOriginally written for www.globaldomination.se\n",
        "\nIn terms of context for reviewing Burzum's 10th album, \"S\u00f4l Austan, M\u00e2ni Vestan\", this is far from ideal. The blistering heatwave being experienced right now is hardly conducive to the listening of bleak, spacey ambient music, plus, more pertinently, the reported arrest and subsequent release this week of one Varg Vikernes for purpotedly planning a 'massacre' has only fired up the keyboard warriors intent on defining the man and not his music. To focus on the music should be the point of this review and thus no further mention will be given to recent occurrences in his new home of France.\n\nNow on the fourth album in as many years since his release from prison, Varg has taken a leaf from the book of his 'incarceration-era' albums and gone totally ambient again, leaving no trace of his highly influential black metal sound to be heard. At 59 minutes long \"S\u00f4l Austan\" is one drawn-out soundscape of keyboard 'rhythm' sounds and floating 'lead' noises that I'm sure is likely to appeal to even fewer than his traditional albums do.\n\nThe strong synth presence that has always been at the heart of Burzum has generated a spiritual bleakness when woven into fabrics of coruscating black metal but which when sat alone can feel inflated and struggle to maintain the same decrepit aura. Unlike the repetitive beauty of \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av den transcendentale egenhetens st\u00f8tte\" from classic LP \"Filosofem\", the eleven tracks of \"S\u00f4l Austan\" do attempt to keep moving, rather than rely on stagnating cyclical patterns, and provide a varying mood from track to track but the overall vibe of other-worldly majesty is harder to convey without greater involvement of other instrumentation. In the likes of \"R\u00fbnar munt \u00fe\u00fb finna\" and \"S\u00f4largu\u00f0i\" a deep, clean bass tone is useful in contrasting with the high-end spacey keys which dominate the affair but their attempt to breathe energy into the piece is akin to melting the ice-caps with a matchstick. \"H\u00ee\u00f0\" and \"Fe\u00f0rahellir\" showcase plenty of the vast, spacey sounds which drip into the depths of the record and return replete with the dust of far-away galaxies to form a pleasant listening experience, but one gets the feeling it is all a little simplistic in Vikernes' approach \u2013 as if merely setting the keyboards to the right tone is the method for creating such depth rather than the work of any great artistic merit.\n\nFor a sense of isolation, a theme that has been central to Vikernes\u2019 life and music all these years, \"S\u00f4l Austan, M\u00e2ni Vestan\" strikes the right notes. It sounds distinctly like the creation of a solitary man, cut off from the scene that rejected synthy ambience within black metal 15 years ago, plus I imagine it works well in darkened, lonesome appreciation. However, for such ambient-inclined moments I have the far more varied textures of Brian Eno to fall back on, and when the time calls for some Burzum, his more traditional works where the ambient and blackened dirges at married together. \"S\u00f4l Austan, M\u00e2ni Vestan\" is a very interesting album from arguably metal\u2019s most divisive character but is ultimately too lacking in a sense of dynamics to be troubling the top grades. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nSomewhere between the reign of the sun and the moon lay that mystical time which some refer to as magic hour. Much has been made about this small division within the 24 hour cycle of the heavens, thus it seems only natural for Burzum to adopt it as a subject for a return to the ambient part of said band's controversial history. It's debatable as to whether this band ever truly grasped the full scope of what this style has been since its rise in the 20th century, but its influence has had a lasting impact on all of the key players in the early Norwegian 2nd wave, and its impact upon Varg has been arguably the most overt. As such, it wouldn't be out of place to suggest that Burzum doesn't create ambient music in the classical sense (forgive the oxymoron there), but rather exists in its own contemplative world where the best label to attach to it is ambient music.\n\nIt is necessary to compare and contrast \"S\u00f4l Austan, M\u00e2ni Vestan\" with its predecessors for purposes of context, though it does not necessarily imply a superiority of stylistic device on any of the 3 albums' part, but more a great strength of final outcome. This album does not suffer from the low-fidelity midi-keyboard character of \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\", but it finds itself stylistically closer to said album in terms of instrumental timbres, largely employing a virtual orchestra with a slight folksy tinge to it, though perhaps a better comparison could be made to the 14 minute ambient song \"Tomhet\" which employs a similarly restful and nostalgic character. The quality of the keyboard sounds does come a bit closer to what is heard on \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\", but it doesn't come off as overtly Eastern influenced from start to finish, though those influences do play a role at times. But as a whole, this album makes itself distinct primarily by a greater level of depth and variation, though at times it does find itself reverting back to similar note groupings that suggests a recurring concept.\n\nThe moods that are painted from one song to the next is primarily where this album succeeds in transcending the barrier between simply being a trance-inducing series of minimalist meandering and a magical, otherworldly experience. Things begin on something of a mysterious note with \"S\u00f4l Austan\", where phasing synthesizer tones and streaming 3 note motives paint the picture of a portal to another realm. As things progress, a more percussive and tribal variation on the still restful tone of this album emerges in \"R\u00fbnar Munt B\u00fb Finna\", in turn paving the way for an airy ensemble of synthesized pluck-string sounds in \"S\u00f4larr\u00e2s\". And like any good album tied to a singular concept, this one finds itself coming full circle by the time \"M\u00e2ni Vestan\" fades in with a mixture of pluck-string sounds and a flowing synthesized bow-string atmosphere, rolling through like an extravagant comet in the night sky, before the album closes on a misty contemplative note with \"S\u00f4lbj\u00f6rg\", featuring a slightly distorted mixture of guitar and piano sounds as it floats away like a fog before the setting sun.\n\nIt might be a cop-out, but this truly is an album that will either be completely loved with the affection of an eternal lover or scoffed at as some sort of bizarre hiccup after a consistent series of post-rock influenced black metal. There is definitely a particular context in which this music functions and it is largely for that of daydreaming or meditation, and it functions quite well in that capacity. Granted, contemplation is not the usual road that the typical metal fanatic goes for when there are perfectly good neck vertebrae to be thrown out of alignment, but Varg has never really made music for the typical listener by any standard. Maybe the writer of this review is just making lofty excuses for liking something that most don't, but at the same time, this is one of those albums that is worth making excuses for.\n",
        "\nAll of the post-incarceration releases by Burzum have been ceremoniously met with a wide division between beleaguered rancor and progressive wonderment. One thing that's certain is that Varg Vikernes has, at least for the time being, left the black metal milieu far behind. His latest effort, S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan, covers a similar ground of his last three records, but this one is decidedly less 'involved', so to speak.\n\nConcentrating on instrumental passages of imaginative splendor, Burzum has become the poster child for the oft-mentioned-in-hushed-tones '180-degree turn.' The music on S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan goes far beyond typical electronic music with an ethereal slant, dropping itself right into the fray of 'soundscape' storytelling. You certainly have to be in the mood to ingest this music Vikernes is touting today, make no mistake about it. You also have to understand that, by now, he's not going to magically produce a black metal album reminiscent of his Hvis Lyset tar oss era, but hopefully the real fans in the know realized this way back in 1995 with Filosofem. So, what says me about the latest Burzum opus you ask?\n\nI usually tend to stay away from blurbs and reviews before hearing an album for myself, and I successfully managed that here as well. I did happen to hear that the Burzum fan camp (what a glorious dinner gathering that might make) is split down the middle between wanton apologists vying for a coveted spot in Burzum's history and the objective conglomerate that finds these recent recordings interesting and, dare I say, logical progressions? I'm sort of in the middle of that, I suppose. While it's no secret I go 'back' with the band some 20-years, I've successfully maintained my personal affinity with the rational assessing as opposed to irrational bandwagon riding. S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is a somewhat palpable, albeit repetitive and even mundane effort that simply doesn't bode well for the ardent fan trying to stay conscious during its more vested moments (of which there are very few). The wonderful ideas get lost along the way when the music never really goes anywhere past a surface level intrigue. \n\nI fully understand Vikernes' attempt to convey messages of historical importance and inspirational thought provocation, but when you seemingly force the thoughts to stagnate in the mire of the same notes and chord progressions that resound for five to seven minutes a pop, the messages appear lethargic and minute at best, forced and ridiculous at worst. Maybe I miss something in these new Burzum records; maybe it's so far beyond my personal scope that I'm set up for public ridicule and scorn, but the fact remains that any time you have a record so transparent, so baseless that you can't keep your mind on the record, save for its background noise uses, therein lay a problem with the music, not the listener. Even a child could find this record inane and wholly pedestrian in most facets, due in large part to the inability to progress past 30-second structures. \n\nAfter all of these years, it does bother me a bit to systematically tear apart a band I've managed to enjoy in both the metal and the post-metal areas, and I also well understand what Vikernes was attempting to say within these tracks concerning the ascension of man in the Pagan light from the din of darkness - hey, I get it. What I don't understand to my satisfaction is how these otherwise fine pieces of music can drag on and on and on into seemingly endless spheres of dilution and accurately tell this fascinating story. With some variation in, well, sounds, this wonderful tale might have been an incredible journey into a Scandinavian mindset that we might not otherwise examine or even understand. I really found the track \u201c Heljarmyrkr\u201d, or \u201cDeath's Darkness\u201d the most fascinating even in its repetitive brilliance. When a track like this manages to repeat itself , yet haunts and stimulates the mind with such ease, you tend to forgive or even ignore the looped feel to it all; sadly, a record usually cannot keep up that type of rewind-repeat effort throughout and maintain a captive audience. \n\nAll in all, what Burzum now represents is an instrumental delving into ancient and forgotten lore of a rich and wonderful Norwegian country too often lost to the reaches of a societal imbalance with historical record. That is, the captive history of such a beautiful country is attempting to find a spot within the confines of a modern audience though music that can lead you there. The music on S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is not bad at all; it merely suffers from a constant loop syndrome that deviates too little from the essence to actually convey messages in a useful and encapsulating manner. What I can sum up with is to say that the music herein speaks short sentences when larger paragraphs are necessary to successfully complete the story. It simply missed the intended mark.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nBack then, in late 1992, Varg Vikernes, the only man behind Burzum, realised that style of music he among others created, started being copied by a lot of bands. Since then, he has tried in vain to do something radically different in each release. He first tried with Filosofem. But he failed, miserably. It turned out to be an even more black-metal album. I can't think of an album that defines more black metal than that one. Well, maybe Transilvanian Hunger. Maybe. Then, in prison and even with a MIDI keyboard, he released a pair of albums that still sounded very much black metal and burzum-esque while being ambient. When he came out of prison he made Belus and then Fallen, both sounding very much black metal (especially the former). And with Umskiptar we can't deny that he was definitely drifting away from black metal. But it still was black metal to some degree.\n\nSo, in early 2013 he announced that he was going to release an ambient/electronic album. And he's doing it without being imprisoned. So everyone was expecting something like Dau\u00f0i Baldrs with better quality. They were wrong. There are no traces of black metal here. This has almost nothing dark. In fact, four songs here have the word \"S\u00f4l\" (that means \"Sun\" in Old Norse) in their name. And yes, this is the first Burzum album which makes sense to listen to during daytime. So, finally, Varg has managed to do it. And it is somehow still Burzum. \n\nIt's hard for me to offer insight about actual tracks, since it flows incredibly well from one to another that I doesn't really realize when one ends and another one starts. But I'll try. S\u00f4l austan is promising since the beginning. It's spacey and relaxing, and it has some kind of old feel. With old I don't mean 80s or 70s. I really mean like flying backwards through aeons to the Stone Age. I believe this is what this track is all about. The initiation ritual. Now, imagine that after that trip you are now a Neanderthal having a bath in a natural spa within a cave in Iceland. There are some other Neanderthals around you painting in the walls of the cave and some are playing primitive drums and percussion, while you can see aurora borealis outside the cave. This is exactly how listening to the second track R\u00fbnar munt \u00fe\u00fb finna (which translates as \"You shall find secrets\") feels like.\n\nS\u00f4larr\u00e2s is more like the first track but adding (virtual?) acoustic melodies instead of synth winds, while with Haugaeldr those synths are back in a slower and more hypnotic track that still feels epic somehow. Fe\u00f0rahellir is probably my less favorite song here, and it is the most different one. It is even happy with those keyboard notes being repeated again and again. Then the following two tracks are much more slow-paced and similar evoking memories of forgotten gods sleeping today.\n\nThe track H\u00ee\u00f0 is a very windy track with a lot of synth layers, it feels like a giant polar bear breathing in oceanic cold winds. Then we have Heljarmyrkr, which is probably the saddest track on the album. M\u00e2ni vestan is like flying back brom the Stone Age to our time. It is spacey as well as the first track but this time more melancholic. But the best track and the cherry on top is S\u00f4lbj\u00f6rg. The word means \"sunset\", and this track evokes it perfecty. Listening to it when the sun is setting, with all those strange colours in the sky is just magic. The textures on this track are perfect, and it's much more melody-driven than the other tracks. It is also probably the most melancholic. You remember the beautiful day that has ended as well as the album. This track really makes you want to replay the album since the beginning.\n\nThis album is relaxing and very good for meditating, reading, driving (if you are not tired!), working, writing, chatting, studying or just being in the nature. It is like a soundtrack for a journey. In fact, this is the soundtrack for an amateur film Varg made with his wife. Does it mean that it is \"backgroung music\"? Mostly yes. Is it a bad thing? Not necessarily. And definitely not for me. Although I like to enjoy music and just music, I also like music that I can listen to while doing another thing and it doesn't draw my attention away from what I'm doing. And that is what this album is. It's even good for a listen before sleeping if you have insomnia. Unlike Det Som Engang Var, for example, that may cause you nightmares (first-hand experience, I wake in the middle of the night frightened as hell with Svarte Troner sounding). \n\nS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is not repetitive as it may seem, each song is different if you listen to them separately, but they flow very well. It's probably the most solid Burzum album since Hvis Lyset Tas Oss. The whole album feels somehow short, despite during almost an hour. I recommend it.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s face it: Burzum is no longer musically relevant, and has not been for a long time. Varg Vikernes\u2019 over-publicized shenanigans are now tantamount to clich\u00e9 in black metal, and the mere discussion of the murders and church burnings are bound to result in groans from the genre\u2019s veterans. With that being said, though I\u2019ve never been a fan of his art or actions, there\u2019s no denying the sort of effect and influence he\u2019s had on the generations of black metal since. Since being released from that three-star hotel the Norwegians called a prison, Varg\u2019s return to black metal has been met with mixed reception, and that\u2019s putting it gently. While 2009\u2019s \u201cBelus\u201d was at least better than I expected, Burzum\u2019s recent material has not stood out from any of the artists also grasping at the perceived glory of his early work. With this in mind, it\u2019s no surprise that Vikernes has decided to throw in the towel and effectively \u2018retire\u2019 from black metal. Now focusing solely on his ambient material, I feel we\u2019ve come to the denouement of Burzum\u2019s career. \u201cS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan\u201d makes for a quiet, familiar piece of dark ambient that may as well serve as exit music for his career. Although I may sound critical of the direction Vikernes has decided to go with this one, Burzum\u2019s latest plunge into the realm of dark ambient is a natural way of distancing himself from a contemporary black metal scene that left him behind long ago. For all of its quiet atmosphere and simplicity, it\u2019s a refreshing change of pace from Burzum\u2019s post-prison era metal output.\n\nUnlike past ambient works of Varg\u2019s such as \u201cDaudi Baldrs\u201d (which sounded like a cheap soundtrack to an 8-bit RPG more than anything), \u201cS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan\u201d gives me the impression that Varg might actually be well-suited for this kind of purely ambient arrangement. No longer does Varg\u2019s ambient work sound like a bland assortment of computer MIDIs attempting to recreate \u2018real\u2019 instruments; it seems Vikernes understands the fundaments of electronic-based music alot better than he used to. Although there is a smattering of acoustic guitars to add some liveliness to the sound, much of the album is devoted to soft electronic textures, and repetitive, atmospheric motifs. To Mr. Vikernes\u2019 credit, \u201cS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan\u201d conveys a greater sense of cold and winter than his metal stuff. Even the album\u2019s most ornate arrangements may still be considered largely minimalistic in nature. Although texture and atmosphere are the most heavily weighted aspects of the music, there remains a sense of composition and direction throughout. It\u2019s not something that you hear too often in dark ambient music, and while it may take the music a long time to say anything, the sense of structure gives the album a more immediate appeal than much of the ambient I have heard before.\n\nAlthough the album has been divided into eight tracks, there\u2019s no sense of distinctiveness between songs. It all tends to run together as a single, hour-long experience. For the intent of being inherent \u2018background\u2019 music, this suits it fine. If there\u2019s one thing Burzum has managed to retain from the project\u2019s infancy onwards, it\u2019s an ability to conjure atmosphere. Any listener\u2019s relaxation or distraction aside however, there is no reason for the album to be as long as it is. \u201cS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan\u201d is one of those few cases when the music could have said just as much in thirty minutes as it does in fifty eight, and I get the feeling that it could have been a more effective piece of work, had Varg capitalized on the most inventive ideas and shortened the length a bit. At its best, Burzum\u2019s latest ambient foray could be likened to a Skaldic version of electronic pioneer Klaus Schulze\u2019s wandering space soundscapes. Though the excellent choice of album cover might imply a sense of urgency and travel, there\u2019s little dynamism or variety to speak of here. \u201cS\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan\u201d is bleak, lonesome and likely unappealing to the denizens among his fanbase who limit themselves to black metal. It lacks the innovation or ambitious manipulation of sound that the truly great ambient albums tend to have, but for those- like myself- who were getting tired of hearing Varg rehash the same tired style of black metal, it\u2019s a welcome change of pace, if not such an imaginative one.\n",
        "\nUpon first learning of Varg Vikernes' decision to return to the ambient music medium for the followup to Umskiptar, I might have been in the minority which did not act with undue trepidation. Yet having actually listened through S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan a number of times now, I'll admit that the wariness of others has, not for the first time, borne fruit, because this is by far the most insipid and unrewarding experience in his catalog, wolfed into the sheepskin of an esoteric minimalism which I might have expected, but didn't end up enjoying in the slightest. I say this having had a split reaction to his prior output in the field. The much maligned Dau\u00f0i Baldrs (1997) filled out its cheaper situational budget aesthetics with memorable melodies and an atmosphere which recounted the dark medieval games I might have played in my Commodore 64 years...and with a long history of VGM and Midi appreciation, I felt a certain hypnotic charm in spite of its unremitting cheesiness. But on the other hand, Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf (1999) had a drier, meditative quality marred by a lack of interesting note progressions or skillfully textured sounds, and I had some difficulty being phased by its threadbare aural countenance.\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to dub the latter a 'dud', but S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan ('East of the sun, west of the moon') unfortunately acts as a weaker, spiritual successor to that second ambient record rather than the triumph I would have hoped for after over a decade of potential contemplation and preparation. To be blunt, the album is so stripped of ideas, and sparse with its melodic configurations that it seems as if he could have improvised the entire hour's worth of content in a single sitting. Effortless, spacious and not just a little lazy, all of which might be forgiven if the 11 tunes within were actually poignant or interesting. What might seem like an experiment for Varg (or to his metal-centric audience) is little more than a rehashing of New Age musical ideals circa the 70s and 80s, falling somewhere between the works of Tangerine Dream, Vangelis or Mike Oldfield and the archaic 'dungeon synth' of Mortiis in structure and tone, but with none of the depth and instrumentation those acts were able to evoke in their respective climates. S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is essentially a collection of synthesizer/string mantras which seems like it might have some promise for about 2-3 minutes, but ends up going nowhere, with a pitiful concentration of tones that shift only marginally through the course of the track list...\n\nSure, it's 'consistent', but consistently dull, pensive only in the most superficial case that its baseline knack for repetition will force the listener's mind elsewhere...internally, or desperate to fill itself with information from a passing squirrel, a car, baby stroller, bird, plane, or any other kinetic distraction you might encounter out in public. If indoors, well you're pretty much fucked. The basic premise for the entire album is also its primary constriction: manifest a soothing, predictable series of notes with either a bell- or organ- derived pad, or a torturous acoustic line, and then capitulate to a more acidic synth wave which cuts into the mix. Once in a while you might get an electronic bass line (\"M\u00e2ni vestan\") or a more thoroughly sustained timbre to the synthesizer which gives the impression that John Tesh is hosting a beat-less rave out on the tundra, but rarely are there more than two sounds happening in conjunction. Not that there is much need for percussion on an ambient record, but this leaves the burden of building momentum solely upon the synthesizers, which are clearly not up to the task. As for dynamic pacing or variation between tracks in mood, you'd probably get just as much from listening to the trickle of fountain amidst bird calls one morning. Thanks to its very limited palette of sounds and notes, S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is developmentally stunted and incapable of surprise transitions or climactic expression.\n\nDespite all of that, I tried very hard to like it. First by changing the environment in which I experienced the music. A cool morning stroll beneath a sea rain on the New England coast seemed the perfect atmosphere to evince some deeper contemplation from the procession of notes, but drew only exasperated emotional blanks. Then by shadows and candlelight. Nothin'. Having owned a box of dusty New Age tapes and CDs since my teens, and harboring a continued love of ambient music in general, the only real praise I can dole upon the album is that it triggers a nostalgia for the synthesizer-based compositions of olde. The instruments are bright and clear, while the counterbalance of more ritualistic, Medieval/Dark Age progressions with the sizzling synth waves creates a curious generational clash without lacking coherence. But part of what has always drawn me to Burzum music is the presence of a 'hook'. Whether it was \"War\", \"Dunkelheit\", \"M\u00f3ti Ragnarokum\" or \"Jeg Fallen\", there was almost always some vocal theme, keyboard passage or chord progression which would hang in the brain for years (or decades), and this is entirely void of that trait.\n\nTo save the cybertrolls and internet scholars some time, keystrokes and trouble: 'You just don't get it, man!' Oh, I get it, I get it just fine, thanks for asking, o pompous, overinflated shitwits. I've got no diametric sense of opposition to the sandbox Varg plays around in here, nor do I maintain an enmity for any artist who dwells in more than one medium (in this case, having very often combined them in the past on the lauded earlier albums). I've got a copy of Crypt of the Wizard and Neptune Towers, and enjoy them both. As much as it is in season to do so, Burzum is not an artist I tend to take lightly, having enjoyed most of his previous full-lengths (excluding Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf and Belus), and S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is not weak because it's an ambient effort, or rather, 'not-a-black-metal-album!' It's weak because it's highly underdeveloped, arbitrarily repetitious, and musically uninspired, regardless of how visionary Varg's self-stylized Scaldic music might eventually pan out to be. Boring music was boring yesterday, today, and will continue to be so for decades to come, no matter who writes and releases it, and S\u00f4l austan, M\u00e2ni vestan is at best fit as background music for a palm reading at your local fortune teller, not that I...well...I told you I tried.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n\"Filosofem\" is one of these albums that, however famous and influential for the metal scene, still manages to create this minimalistic, intimate feeling of being surrounded by yourself and Mother Nature only while you listen to it. I regard it as an absolute masterpiece and I can state my reasons. \n\nFirstly, I think of something as a real work of art when it has proved itself throughout the years. You can listen to this record many years after the time when the songs where created and still get the message of it and enjoy it. Secondly and most importantly, I consider a piece of music brilliant not when it's too long, too professional, or too polished, but when it evokes real emotions in you. \"Filosofem\" manages to wake up really weird and mixed emotions in me, but it does make me feel in a certain way, which I believe should be the purpose of every album. Thirdly, I regard it as real masterpiece because it does the latter better than most albums I've ever listened to.\n\nPeople sometimes ask me, \"how can you listen to the music of someone who burns churches?\", as if I have sealed a deal with Satan. I've also been asked, \"how could I listen to music with such brutal and violent lyrics such as black metal?\". I've tried explaining several times, then after meeting a wall of complete lack of understanding, I just give it up. Some people will never understand Burzum. I will simply state why: this music is not supposed to be understood by the general public. I also think that most people who are \"into metal\" wouldn't understand Burzum as well because to some bands there's just more to the music. There are complex ideas and not just the plain \"rock your asses, fuck women, drink and enjoy yourself\" ones, and this is the case with this album. To fully understand it, you have to live with the music. I'm sorry if you're one of those people who listen to black metal and then go drink coffee in a fashionable bar in the mall. You better stop reading and leave the page.\n\n\"Filosofem\" was created to contradict the already excising black metal scene in Norway. As both Fenriz and Varg said, black metal turned into what it shouldn't have turned into: a trend. People began listening to the music just to go with the flow and dress up. Opposing all that, Varg wanted to create something so distorted, obscure, and against the mainstream as to annoy and dissatisfy the other musicians in Norway. Unfortunately, to some extent, as he himself says, it became an absolute cult. \n\nBeing the fourth full-length release under the name Burzum, \"Filosofem\" is in many aspects very different from its predecessors and in many is quite alike. While \"Burzum\" reminds me more of early Bathory with its thrashy and raw black metal style and \"Hvis Lyset tar oss\" delving into more atmospheric and nihilistic approach, yet still possessing huge amounts of hatred, the one we have here is more likely trying to look toward folk traditions, nature, and the folklore as a whole rather than focusing on primal hatred. However, just like the previous albums, \"Filosofem\" has a distinguished character of its own that makes it stand out from the crowd. The opener, \"Burzum\", \"Dunkelheit\", or \"Darkness\" is one of the most characteristic and recognizable Burzum songs, a seven minute kvlt journey through an absolutely moonless night. It starts with the most distorted guitar riff that ever was, soon accompanied by the repetitive drum section. Not too long after the keyboards also join, creating the most haunting and mysterious atmosphere. Varg's vocals are also not clear and sound as distant as possible, almost buried below the instruments. Around minute three there is something like a solo, which sounds as if coming from somewhere very far away. While in most normal songs a solo is something which is emphasized on, on \"Dunkelheit\" it is only a distant mystery. The lyrics are just like the song - freezing the blood and utterly transfixing. Varg has that unmatched ability of writing short and simple, yet absolutely fucking incredible lyrics. I can't think of many songwriters that are as good in writing the lyrics as well as the music. Always covered in a shadow and a veil of mystery:\n\n\"When night falls she cloaks the world in impenetrable darkness.\nA chill rises from the soil and contaminates the air..\nSuddenly...life has a new meaning. \"\n\nThe second track, \"Jesu D\u00f8d\" or Jesus Death is the only song on \"Filosofem\" in which Varg's vocals really remind of previous Burzum records. His distinguishable singing like in \"War\" or \"My journey to the stars\" is also remindful of the singing in \"Jesu D\u00f8d\". However, what I find really great about this track is the guitar riff - it is the fastest on the record and very easily one of the most hateful riffs I've ever heard. What I really like about this band's early work is the ability of the guitar to represent more anger than any other instrument, including the voice. While most black metal bands try to keep their \"evil standard\" with a hate spawning vocalist the real masters can do that with the guitar. \n\n\"Beholding the daughters of firmament\" as beautifully as the title sounds has my favourite lyrics ever. It channels towards the human existence and is one of these highly philosophical songs that really make you stop and think. It again is as distorted as the other songs on the album, but sounding even colder and it just casts a gloom upon the world. The text is so beautiful, I can't just go on without quoting:\n\n\"In every winter there's a different cold\nin every winter I feel so old\nso very old as the night\nso very old as the dreadful cold\"\n\nIf you enjoy dark and morbid poetry, I bet you would find some of Varg's work really inspirational.\n\n\"Gebrelichkeit\" I & II or \"Decrepitude\" are two really slow and ambient songs. The difference between Burzum's ambiece and many other bands is that the one on this record really creates atmosphere of sheer isolation and hopelessness. Both aren't different in sound from the other songs on \"Filosofem\", being truly distorted and are my least favourite on the album. \"Rundgang um die transzendental\" or \"Circumambulation of the transcendental Pillar of Singularity\" as it is named in English, is my favourite of the three songs, it's a 25 minutes long and while many might find it boring, I really enjoy the bleak and calm comfort in creates. It's the only song in which the use of distortion is completely lacking. Being created by keybords only it's very calming instrumental track. \n\nAs beautiful and magical as the music on this album is, I think that possessing a physical copy of it is essential, because it contains a really great artwork and some very interesting stories that fully help comprehending the album. On overall, I think that the hype and cult towards some works of art is deserved and this album is one of these, regardless of the fact who understands it and who doesn't. After all, to each their own.\n",
        "\nWow, this is bad. In fact, I can hardly believe it. Umpskiptar is more than an hour long and I can hardly imagine anyone listening to the entire album without skipping any part or smashing their own stereo. If anyone managed this exploit, I can only think of a Buddhist monk. Good luck to those who dare try.\n\nNow let's get to the point. Like many of you, I'm an early Burzum diehard fan. I bought Belus and Fallen and found both albums pretty decent, despite being inferior to the '90s classics as well as somewhat repetitive.\n\nUmskiptar is far, far worse. All the good elements from the former works are gone. This is just a series of boring arpeggiated riffs played on a slow tempo and being repeated through more than 7 minutes on each song with Varg quoting the lyrics in his normal voice and occasionally using harsh vocals. Sometimes he sings in a clean voice, but his clean vocals are as uninventive (they follow the main melody) as they are weak (so are the harsh vocals).\n\nWait, the guitars and drums are uninventive, too. They keep on playing the same pattern on and on. The lead guitars are completely forgettable. The whole full-length sounds like a guitar practice method or like a long incomprehensible, unrhyming poem recited over a melody-rhythmic background. No inspiration, no variation, and no emotion (except boredom).\n\nAdd to that all the flaws of the two former albums (which still had at least catchy melodies and trance-inducing moments) and you have Umskiptar. Fortunately, I listened to the full album before blindly buying it. Had I bought it I would have sold it back after the first listening session. I don't really want to try and go for a second session, enough is enough.\n\nMy mark is 5% because I liked the beginning of \"Valgaldr\" (the first 20 seconds).\n",
        "\nGood old Varg Vikernes at his very best days. Vikernes himself claims his music is for Europeans only, is it so wrong that me as being a yank to enjoy this piece of work wrong? It certainly doesn't feel wrong. This album composes 4 long tracks into one amazing composite opus. Many instances on this record surround its listener with deep atmosphere, complex build-ups and memorable musicianship complimented with agonizing vocals. Much of Burzum's work was recorded within the year of 1992, yet released and scattered about within the proceeding years, which means Vikernes himself put a lot of effort into creating the music he did within the first two years of starting Burzum, but simply leaving Hvis lyset tar oss at simply the best of them all. \n\nThis album is a classic for many reasons. Its song structure, variety and elements are almost perfectly laminated into the sheer structure of mid-aged black metal. The opening track \"Det som en gang var\" is a ritual-esque moderate tempo track with a long intro seduces its listener into a forest of dismay that is Burzum. The following song \"Hvis lyset tar oss\" is a fast-paced beast, bearing the lines of influence to many bands coming above Vikernes' brainchild. Gorgoroth, Emporror, Enslaved among others can be heard having styles within the realm of simply just this one song. The characteristic elements and atmosphere that the backing synthesizers layered above the guitar work almost entwine with each other in the same sense of sitting alone in a forest during a heavy storm. \n\nEven the concept of the record is deep as its music is, according to Vikernes the record is based about \"What once was, before the light took us and we rode into the castle of the dream. Into emptiness. It's something like: beware the Christian light, it will take you away into degeneracy and nothingness. What others call light I call darkness. Seek the darkness and hell and you will find nothing but evolution.\" The fact that its anti-Christian theme seeps amongst its dismal sound is almost the epitome of original black metal. I do not support or unsupport any type of religion in any way personally, but the purist creation and stance of a true black metal remark truly is something to praise\n\nEvery song is very different from the last, while I don't so much enjoy the rough blarings of \"Inn i slottet fra dr\u00f8mmen\", it's usually other things that save my un-enjoyment from things I do enjoy. In this case, Vikernes' drumming on this song is phemonimal and his rhythm guitar parts are also praisable. I also forgot to mention, the bass guitar is clearly audiable most of the time throughout the album while observing the instruments taking the lead above it. It's not so much to praise, but the fact that it's just there is a delight enough. \n\nFinally, the final track \"Tomhet\" and all its glory closes the album almost perfectly. It's just as its title translate to in English; \"empiness\" and here, almost every time I hear this song, I'm granted with the feeling of desolation and emptiness. Atmosphere is the key in hearing projects such as Burzum and I believe what truly makes it so great. Hvis lyset tar oss is a record that never went forgotten once in the realm of black metal and for every right reason at that.\n",
        "\nWhen one creates a masterpiece, it doesn't mean it will be seen by everyone as such, but it will be realised by anyone that listens to it as something different, far from everything the artist has already done. This is clearly the case of Filosofem, since the feeling passed by this particular album is something elsewhere still unfelt.\n\nWhile Varg Vikernes would, in his previous releases, try to the utmost to provoke darkness and fear with very heavy songs, Filosofem would have a rather enlightening and astonishing sound made over minimalism, living up to the album title, \"Filosofem\", a Norwegian word meaning \"philosopheme\", a succinct philosophic argument, emphasising Burzum's philosophic style. This specific album is about the duality between the Sun and the Moon, light and darkness, day and night, illustrated by the wonderful Nordic mythology, that sees the Sun (the goddess Sol) and the Moon (the god Mani) as brother and sister.\n\nAs soon as you have the album on your hands and you see such a cold and desolate cover, you can start having a feeling of what you will be listening to. This impression is strengthened after you open it and see the amazing art, both on the CD and on the inside. If you get the album phisically, I highly recommend you to open the booklet, take a look at the amazing art inside, beholding it while you listen to the album. If you understand Norwegian (or have spare time enough to translate it), you should take a look at the texts as well, and you'll understand more easily the concepts behind the music.\n\nThe guitars overall are destructive, they interact in some kind of organised chaos, since the purposely low-budget effects used made them at the same time chaotically distorted and clear, while previous guitars in Burzum would be more \"natural\", as in with less effects, however, rawer, hence not as clear as in Filosofem. Another instrumental point that was sharply defected in this album was the presence of keyboards and synthesisers. While these had little to no importance in the previous albums, they would give a last touch in the high end of the guitar sounds. The songs where this characteristic goes stronger are Burzum and Rundtg\u00e5ing Av Den Transcendentale Egenhetens St\u00f8tte, both with keyboards getting contrastingly mixed with the rhythm guitars, that play basically the same melody.\n\nHowever, the accompanying section, formed by the drums and the bass, seems to be much weaker in this album, for a good reason though, since this album had a much greater focus on the melody. The bass is barely heard overall while the drums play an entrancing rhythm. The result of such a strong melody with such a simple accompaniment is the trance caused by the captivation of the song by the listener, the great Filosofem-feeling.\n\nIn the songs Burzum (the oldest one ever recorded to the project but previously unreleased), Jesu D\u00f8d and Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament, to cause such a feeling, Varg would use some heavy distortion and many chaotic sound effects on beautiful and interesting melodies led by clear guitars and keyboards. This contrast involves the listener in such a way that it's impossible not to feel mesmerised by their result. I call attention for the self-titled song. Since \"Burzum\" is, in the Lord of the Rings series, a Black Speech word for the Mordor evil and the lyrics quite resemble the concept on the books, our first thought is that it's the sole meaning of this song. However, we can see Varg creating a parallel. Here, the night that falls would be the Dark Ages, while the darkness would be the horror the Catholic Church installed, or maybe even the \"darkness\" Varg sees religion to causes in a religious mind.\n\nIn the later recorded songs Jesu D\u00f8d and Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament, Varg creates another kind of atmosphere, making a much heavier and more serious sound, without stopping from being thought inducing as the first track though. Both songs use ice cold melodies all along the structure. Jesu D\u00f8d is played with a destructive riff, with lyrics that contrast the sacred and the unholy antithetically, at the same time drawing a parallel to Nietzsche's famous sentence \"God is dead\", while the song's title means \"Jesus's death\". That could be because of the criticism of direction and rationalism used by both Varg and Nietzsche. \"Beholding the Daughters of Firmament\", though, are the thoughts of a dying man beholding the duality between the night and the sun, the main concept of the album (as we can see on the chart).\n\nMeanwhile, the long instrumental tracks \"Decrepitude II\" and \"Rundtg\u00e5ing Av Den Transcendentale Egenhetens St\u00f8tte\" are around the minimalist essence of the album, are both well written and, despite being big, are not tiring at all. Decrepitude II has a strong structure and is focused basically on the guitar, letting one just trip on their distorted raucously played power chords. Its falling structure makes it the perfect closing song for such an album.\n\nSummarising my text, it's a simply amazing thing to see how, as in everything ever made through Burzum, everything fits in this album. Each note, each centimeter of art, each word of the texts. That's the best example of how a genius Varg Vikernes is. Both his big though recent fame and his polemic acts and declarations may have outshined his supreme talent, but there's no other word that could describe him but genius.\n",
        "\nThese tracks are mostly spooky, an atmosphere of gloom, isolation, and despair, which is enhanced by the raw midi tones. Judging by the music alone, it still seems fascinating to me that this album could've become so well-known, due to the sheer simplicity and repetition. It is, of course, understandable, considering Burzum's general fame and the hype that was surrounding Varg at the time, and this album as well, being his first \"prison album.\" In a way I'd say that the hype was a very good thing, because it allowed listeners to explore a very eccentric release that I think most would usually avoid judging on the music alone. Instead, people listened and attempted to understand, and though I personally do not know that there is too much to \"get\" here, it still played a powerful role in opening people's minds to what could be done with the dungeon mood.\n\nThere are some quite magical moments mixed in with these trudges through desolation, such as Hermo\u00f0r \u00e1 Helfer\u00f0 and M\u00f3ti Ragnar\u01ebkum. \n\nThis work as a whole could best be described by the term \"vampiric.\" I certainly don't mean that in the sense of the popular modern notion of vampires, of course, but more along the lines of what it symbolizes: the decayed aristocracy, a noble bloodline turned monstrous by the weight of time. I feel as if Varg most strongly falls into his persona as \"Count Grisnakh\" here, the title and blood of a high-born person but with the repugnance and innate evil of an orc. One can almost picture, especially during tracks such as B\u00e1lfer\u00f0 Baldrs and \u00cd Heimr Heljar, a horrific tyrant, limping through a rotting castle, barking orders at subordinates, drunkenly attacking servant, or sometimes just screaming at empty air in his inbred madness.\n\nThe mood becomes far more somber in Illa Ti\u00f0andi. It is a song filled with loss. It feels as if this is a more sober look at just how deeply this once-beautiful existence has been corrupted. It seems to have fully accepted the hopelessness, but there is beauty nonetheless, if only in a sort of dreamlike remembrance of what must've once been, though can be experienced no longer. The length of this track is the longest in the album, and I think for good reason, since I feel that it represents the sands of time blowing on, the long wait before life might return to the desert. It is a mood of not only loss, but acceptance, recognizing that night inevitably comes.\n\nAnd then there is the track which I feel is the highlight of the album, M\u00f3ti Ragnar\u01ebkum, which is the rebirth where the previous track was the death. It is grand and glorious; one sees the towers crumbling, the earth splitting asunder, fires raining from the heavens, and finally senses that the thorough rot is being washed away. This track might even be the climax of all of Burzum's ambient material, that this decadent modernity which Varg so opposes finally meets its inevitable destruction, so that the life might begin anew without this debilitating disease.\n\nhttp://dungeonsynth.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nSecond and last album in what was originally intended to be a trilogy based on Norse myths and legends about how the world would end, \"hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\" is a better effort than the previous \"Daudi Baldrs\": Vikernes got some half-decent synthesisers and the result is a sonically richer and deeper work though it's still quite limited in its range of expression due in part to the man's heavy reliance on minimalist repetition as his main compositional template. The album has great atmospheres but sounds very much like a soundtrack to a film or documentary with gentle New Age spiritual or environmental themes: not really what Vikernes had in mind!\n\nMost tracks are a mix of German and proto-Germanic titles. \"Tuistos Herz\" starts off the album with a curiously Oriental sound and ambience that would be right for an old Japanese historical drama about a bunch of ronin samurai wandering the countryside and secretly planning to avenge their lord's death. It's very spacious and effective as an introduction to the track \"Der Tod Wuotans\" (\"The Death of Wotan\") which initially threatens a lot of bombast but turns out to be a melancholy yet dignified and restrained elegy with a solo repeating synth-oboe melody a major highlight of the piece here. The emotion is sorrowful without being maudlin.\n\nThe next track \"Ansuzgardaraiwo\" is surprisingly industrial in rhythm yet there is a quaint mythical feel about it as though we've entered a Tolkienesque world in which dwarves are hard at work in smithies pounding out iron swords, helmets and shields. \"Die Liebe Nerthus\" (\"The Love of Nerthus\") continues the mediaeval feel with simple melodies that repeat over and over on harpsichord and zorna-like instruments (a zorna is a reedy woodwind) and the occasional hand-percussion beat. Subsequent tracks tend to sound ever more sparse and fragile with repetitive fragile melodies played on what seems like a large variety of instruments, until you remember a keyboard instrument is capable of replicating most conventional musical instruments, and the melodies rarely developing further beyond their simple circular one-finger notes. This wouldn't matter if the subject of the album had been a spiritual one about finding one's proper path in life and meditating on it but the subject's actually meant to be very violent: it is about the run-up to Ragnarok and the destruction of the gods, the giants and their battleground the Earth with humans being part of the, er, collateral damage.\n\nFor such sparse tunes, the acoustics and the space in-between sounds have to be precisely determined and while some tracks like \"Frijos goldene Tranen\" (\"Freya's golden hair\", I think) are very bewitching, delicate and gorgeous in sound, the space behind them is blank when perhaps it should be cold and cavernous to give the music a 3-D sculptural feel. \n\nThe album ends with a whimper rather than a bang and doesn't inflame listeners with anticipation and excitement for the third album, which would have been about Ragnarok, the end of the world and its rebirth, cleansed of all evil and sin; Vikernes decided to abandon the project and concentrate on writing. Generally the earlier tracks sound much better than the later ones and have more individuality as separate tracks with their own atmospheres and emotions; it's as if about half-way through the recording Vikernes lost interest in this project but continued with it just to get it out of the way. Later tracks can be downright basic and one-dimensional in structure. I get the feeling that Vikernes got a bit lost in this second installment and tried to make something more out of it but couldn't. \n\nFor all the atmosphere and beauty that can be found on a number of tracks, there isn't much sense of Vikernes being fully immersed in the human emotions of the gods and giants as they prepare for what they know will be the ultimate showdown that will end in their deaths. The protagonists and antagonists' fear of death and dying, their sense that Ragnarok is what they were born for, perhaps their anger and frustration that there could have been a better way and the world needn't have become so evil that it has to die, their sorrow that so many opportunities for reconciliation and forgiveness of one another's foibles and mistakes were lost or wasted, their rage at themselves for being so stupid and short-sighted - all these emotions and much more could have inspired some really great ambient / symphonic black metal.\n",
        "\nThis album was intended to be the first of a trilogy based on old Norse myths and legends about how the world would end. A black metal sensibility definitely exists in the tone and melodies used here although all instrumentation is entirely synthesiser-based. This is not out of choice on the artist's part: at the time of recording, Varg Vikernes was in prison serving a maximum jail sentence of 21 years for the murder of Oystein Aarseth (Euronymous, of Mayhem) and acts of arson, one of which led to the death of a fire-fighter. Initially prison authorities had allowed Vikernes to keep guitars in jail but confiscated them after he attempted to break out of jail. (Some people have suggested to me that Vikernes might not have been allowed to keep guitars in jail for the same reason that shoelaces and neck-ties aren't allowed - there's a suicide risk.) So here is a unique opportunity to hear black metal or something like it without the instruments most associated with the genre and discover whether the music can stand on its own without those instruments. From the results on \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\", the answer is very definitely yes so on that level, the album is a success; but whether Vikernes can build on that style and add something that no other black metal musician can do, that's another problem altogether and this is where his reputation as a composer and performer lives or dies. Sad to say, the album quickly reveals the limitations of Vikernes as a composer and arranger of music and music pieces.\n\nThe title track is an example the problems of the album that other MA reviewers have referred to: for such a long piece and a pivotal one at that, it is endlessly and maddeningly repetitive, with no variation in tone, texture, intensity and volume among other things. Vikernes has ignored, either wilfully or otherwise, most aspects of what we'd call the dynamics of sound in his attempt to construct music on minimalist principles. What can be done with electric guitars can't always be done with other instruments like pianos whose range of sound and potential to express mood and emotion might be great but fall on other sound criteria because the tones produced are always pure and can't be distorted for texture or modulated for volume. So you would try to compensate by experimenting with sound and through trial and error come up with something interesting that might take you on a different path but there's no indication that Vikernes has done that here. The result is that the mood and emotion expressed on this and other tracks here are fixed, and over several minutes become frozen and blank. Imagine talking to someone whose face assumes a look that stays the same the whole length of time you're both chatting about the same topic, and which only ever changes when the topic changes, and you would soon think your poor companion was autistic or was missing a brain cell or two. This is what I feel about the album: with the music fixed at the same level of volume and each track only able to express one mood, the overall effect becomes cartoonish and kitschy.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the music is striving for anything: it's merely retelling the events that began with Baldr's death in the competition when he challenged the other gods to try to kill him with weapons fashioned from all the trees that had promised not to harm him, only for him to fall from a weapon fashioned by trickster god Loki from the mistletoe which had made no such promise, to the point before the battle of Ragnarok begins. There is no interpretation of those events, nothing to suggest that Vikernes had studied his source material and found something that resonated very deeply with him and which he believed might mean the same to others so he tries to communicate what he found meaningful through this recording. At this point, listeners might well wonder: does Vikernes feel anything at all? If he calls himself an artist, what is he trying to communicate here? The legend of Baldr is not being done any justice.\n\nSome might argue that given the conditions that Vikernes recorded this album in, we should be more forgiving; let's not forget though that a lot of black metal as well as other music has been composed, played and recorded in equally bad and often worse situations, and performers have often forced their instruments to do things that they weren't made to do, or had instruments that were cheap, broken or missing parts. I'm sure that if I knew what conditions most albums I've reviewed here were recorded under, I'd probably award another 10 percentage points at least for sheer effort, ingenuity and sweat that didn't make it onto the final result. \n\nIt's not a long album but the music grows stale very quickly. There are good melodies and even a bit of drama, especially on the last track \"Moti Ragnarokum\", but the relentless circularity deadens any emotional effect. There's little here that moves the listener and that's a pity because there's a lot of potential in the melodies to express drama, complex mood and intensity. Not for the first time have I wondered if there's much substance and character to Vikernes, from the evidence I find here and on some other recordings he's done.\n\nIf there's any worth to the \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\", it's demonstrated that there is an art to being an arranger of music and music instrumentation as well as composer, and that for all Vikernes has given us in the past - and he has given us some very good music in albums like \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" and \"Filosofem\", there's no doubt about that - there's something lacking in his artistic development that I feel will continue to hinder his music career and that this lack tells us something about his personality and moral being.\n",
        "\nNaturally, there has been substantial controversy surrounding the latest effort by Norway's finest one-man black metal band, Burzum. Seemingly, you will either love or hate most of his work. I place myself firmly in the former camp.\n\nBurzum is a constantly evolving band that reminds us all that music is, in its purest form, highly self indulging and that it is the expression of an individual. Varg Vikernes has not made \"another Burzum album\" with 'Umskiptar'. Rather, he has spoken what's truly on his mind. It seems that people were expecting 'Umskiptar' to continue in the style of the previous album, 'Fallen' with its folk influenced black metal. Instead, Vikernes adopts a far more brooding, melancholic vibe which is effectively used throughout the work. This will undoubtedly be very alienating to much of Burzum's fan base. Yet, the more open-minded fans will probably respect this for the fearless musical stand that it is.\n\nMusically speaking, 'Umskiptar' is phenomenal. It feels grand in scale, yet strangely minimalist at the same time. Largely, it abandons the black metal style of old in favour of a very earthy, ambient folk-metal hybrid. The opening track starts the album off with some narration by Vikernes backed with a highly reverberated drum pattern. Abruptly, we are then led into a harsh, yet flowing black metal riff with more cryptic chanting for the second track. Simplicity, repetition and texture are key elements here. Vikernes is intent on lulling the listener into a trance whereby he may creep into your mind. The third track, 'Alladanz' is incredibly powerful, while retaining these elements. It starts off with a beautifully simple piano melody which brilliantly transposes to the full band and changes to a parallel key. The more traditional black metal rasp is present here, though it offers more of a narrative function. \n\nPauses and silences are used effectively which often progress into a new riff or another layer is added to the music. Sparingly, Vikernes applies a meditative clean vocal line here and there, interspersed throughout the chanting and rasps. These clean vocals add another dimension to the sound but are not overly relied on. They appear where they are needed, no more, no less. On the second last track, 'Gullalder' they add a lovely backdrop to the sound. On the fourth track, they add a more sorrowful, reflective feel to the rather sad, mesmerizing guitar melody. On the eighth track, they almost sound like plainsong. \n\nThe production of 'Umskiptar' is excellent. The guitars have an authentic feel to them. They can in places sound very harsh and in others they can sound more soothing. The bass has a place in the mix where it can provide melodies of its own as well as add overall thickness to the sound. The drums have that very earthy feel to them. On this album, they mainly supplement the sound as evidenced by the lack of blast beats or double bass. This is in keeping with the album's nature. The vocals are produced in a way that they are both in the foreground and background. The spoken narrative sits comfortably behind in the mix, where the rasping and clean singing is more prominent when it shows up. It all sounds very natural. Reverb is applied nicely to the music and vocals which make 'Umskiptar' sound like it is being performed in a hall. \n\nOverall, I was thoroughly impressed with 'Umskiptar'. I found it to be wonderfully authentic and breathtakingly refreshing. Varg Vikernes has outdone himself here with his best work for many years. In my humble opinion, this album stands right up with the greatest albums by Burzum.\n",
        "\nOne-man controversy machine Varg Vikernes long ago sealed his fate in the eyes of most but since his release from incarceration in 2009 the man has been busy - \"Umskiptar\", his third full-length, plus a rerecording of many of his earlier classics, says he is on a mission to make up for lost time. Similar to the first of those, \"Belus\", we are witnessing a more stylistically free Burzum than was ever the case in the early 90s, and one which backs up his protestations at having heard nothing from the genre he helped create by subtly pushing the boundaries of the genre. This is not done through sonic extremity or orchestral pomp, but by the simple, slow-paced organic nature of Vikernes' songs. It may be a tad one-dimensional at times but choose any song from this album and this plaintive, dare I say relaxed feel, is the quintessential offering.\n\nThe trademark Burzum recording dissonance is instantly apparent in first song proper \"J\u00f3ln\" although just as prevalent is his spoken word vocal style which across the album's span features more greatly than the hissed variant, the closest we get today to the hysteric shrieks of old. \"Alfadanz\", with a simple piano opening retains an earthy beauty in its uncluttered style and accessible song structure. As comparators fellow Norwegians Darkthrone come closest to matching the special kind of bleakness in \"Hit Helga Tr\u00e9\" and \"\u00c6ra\" as their stripped-down production also similarly benefits the depth of feelings but this by no means suggests the two bands have a great deal else in common. There is no punky, heavy metal spirit to be found here - just the soulful laments of a man making music for his own sake with no aspirations of a return to premier BM glory (though such is the pull of his name that status could come looking for him).\n\nBy the time you reach \"Galgvi\u00f0r\", \"Surtr Sunnan\" and \"Gullaldr\" the pace slows to a dissonant crawl, with percussion replaced by the clarity of Vikernes' Norse spoken word. I can't understand his words but carefully nuanced and laid out so sparsely gives them a cold, disconcerting edge. Burzum these days are not an extreme BM act but these songs help provide a dose of bitter sadness that trumps a good many conventional BM bands.\n\nLess musically diverse than \"Belus\" but a more cohesive whole, \"Umskiptar\" actually does what few other 'reformed' metal acts have managed to do in recent times - expand on their legacy with new and worthwhile material without tarnishing the past. And whatever your thoughts on the man, that is a fact that cannot be argued with. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nI would have reviewed Burzum\u2019s latest album sooner, had it not been for the fact that this release is such a hard bite to swallow. There\u2019s a lot to get used to here; a lot that\u2019s done differently from previous Burzum releases. From the day my pre-ordered limited edition vinyl copy came in the mail and I put the thing on my turntable, I knew it\u2019d be difficult to review. It took me the better part of a year to \u2018get\u2019 Belus. After a few months of listening to the record I\u2019m still not quite adapted to the album, but I think I\u2019ve managed to understand the better part of it at this point. Running sixty-five minutes with eleven songs ranging from complex and adventurous to mind-numbingly simplistic, there\u2019s a lot to love, and there\u2019s a lot to dislike. Experimentation is usually trial-and-error, hit-and-miss, and Burzum\u2019s Umskiptar is no exception. It has material on it which would comfortably have fit onto Burzum\u2019s earlier works like Aske or Det Som Engang Var (except for the dissimilar production), and I daresay some of the more atmospheric works of Burzum\u2019s post-prison career can be found here as well. Also here are some of the more wishy-washy songs of Burzum, or songs that painfully remind me of the atrocious Dau\u00f0i Baldrs due to their mindless plodding. Some songs are transcendent and meditative, tonally similar to Filosofem, and others reek of lack of inspiration. Let\u2019s break this album down. \n\nOne thing Varg\u2019s kept consistent since he got out of prison is his habit of kicking off every album with an unnecessary intro track that does little other than plod. This one is the best, probably, featuring a droning horn over war drums and a quiet chant. This intro unlike the rest actually got me in the mood right off and built my anticipation up even with such a short run-time. J\u00f3ln is the next track. Much in the vein of Belus by its primal black metal sound and hissing guitars, it quickly becomes evident that this album is conceptually and tonally similar to Varg\u2019s previous albums, and naturally works as their predecessor. The riffs here are great and powerful; the guitar production is perfect. It sounds as primal as any black metal fan would want while still maintaining a clean, professional mix sound. Bass work is once again great and perfectly audible, weaving patterns of its own and sticking to the guitars simultaneously. The drums are varied and aggressive (I\u2019ve always really appreciated Varg\u2019s drumming), though the drums fade into non-existence with the latter songs of the album. \n\nUmskiptar is very interesting in terms of the risks it takes and the identity it strives for. Varg tries a lot of things here. He dabbles and experiments. Far now from black metal but not quite past integrating elements of the genre's style into the music, Varg lays down many twisting, winding riffs that seem to be a cross between some of the material from Det Som Engang Var and Filosofem, alternating between dense, slow-strummed riffs of brooding emotion and airy tremolo-picked black metal riffs to weave interesting songs that seem to really compliment his Old Norse mythology addiction, as in Hit Helga Tr\u00e9. Though he definitely relies on spoken-word vocals more than any musician should, he does not leave out singing and growling. The result is a blend of medieval atmosphere and metal, and it wouldn't surprise me if Varg had lifted music-writing techniques from the ancient Norse he seems to revere so much. On the other hand, he makes some choices here that leave me scratching my head even after several listens. A schmaltzy, cringe-worthy piano intro shoe-horned onto one of the album's best songs; three songs in a row that all could have worked as the album's closing track in their own right; a song that Sunn O))) could have written (with the exception of the spoken word vocals fucking with the atmosphere). These things seem to be cracks in the face of the masterpiece Varg wants to create and prevent the album from beating Belus or Fallen in terms of quality. \n\nI wonder also whether this album's length is justified. I'm a guy who is fine with long albums if they're done right. Burzum's '96 effort 'Filosofem' is a mere minute shorter than this and features a 25-minute minimalistic keyboard riff, but there the nuances of Varg's creeping, unsettling layering came in to play masterfully. Here, I can't say the same thing. Again, Filosofem, 64 minutes with only 6 songs, comes to mind. Umskiptar has 11 tracks, at least two of which could have been taken off to bring the album down ten minutes. Unlike some people who loathe this album, I don't feel exactly 'tortured' by the long length of the album but it does begin to wear on me. I am at least thankful that this album DOES in fact seem to have a specific structure and goal, taking the listener from Point A to Point B without recycling similar-sounding tracks. While it's true that some songs don't belong here as they are not much more than filler, each song is at least has its own identity and you do not hear the same song twice. The album seems to start the listener off with mid-tempo, atmosphere-laden songs with searing black metal riffs and occasional bursts of speed and breaks and interludes here and there to supply variance and depth to the tracks, and as it goes on the album seems to mellow out with long, winding riffs that are journeys in and of themselves. The album dips then into a handful of shorter tracks that pull tricks that Burzum has not tried before (Hei\u00f0r being the prime example), before bringing the listener into melancholic hypnotic songs that are repetitive and simple in their execution. In this way the album almost mimics Filosofem (this is the last time I'm going to bring that album up, I promise), first starting off with the stuff people are more likely to be into and ending with stuff that a lot of people will have to sit around and wonder whether it is juvenile or artistic and bold. I find this late part of the album hit-and-miss. Sometimes the repetition and hypnotic atmosphere works with aplomb for me, such as in Surtr Sunnan, but in other cases (Galgvi\u00f0r), I am baffled with Varg's decision to write the songs AND include them in the final mix of the record. But I'll get more into that song later. \n\nThis album's major fundamental issue lies in the way it's written and how it's written. Varg Vikernes has always said that his music was written for himself and was never meant to pander--it reflected his present state of mind and current interests. I never paid that much mind to this as (almost) every Burzum album to date has impressed me in many ways and are full of things that attract me. But here, Varg's interests are so overblown that they somewhat distract from the actual music. Not one word of the lyrics is of Varg's writing; rather, they are from some really old Norwegian book or something. I think the book is supposed to express some nationalistic ideology, but long story short, this was a crappy idea on Varg's part. It wouldn't be so bad if the lyrics were just another cog in the ultimate result, written for the music as most other bands do. But here, it's the other way around. The music has been written for the lyrics as opposed to the lyrics being written for the music, or so it would seem. This results in Varg using spoken-word vocals almost exclusively. He does not try to sing or growl most of the time. His voice also doesn't match the rhythm of the music on occasion, and this is quite distracting. In the past I've seen musicians take passages of books and use them for lyrics and do it well, but here, Varg seems so hell-bent on referencing that Norwegian tome that some of the musicianship is smeared. On some songs, such as J\u00f3ln, Hit Helga Tr\u00e9, or Valgaldr, one can hardly notice this problem as the music is too enjoyable and works as a whole with the lyrics. However, in the case of Galgvi\u00f0r (easily the worst track of the album), it is painfully obvious that the song exists for the sole purpose of spewing out more passages of that Norwegian book, as the song is composed of one laughable riff and seven minutes of spoken language bullshit. This song would have been pointless if it were thirty seconds, let alone seven minutes. Varg also seems to be trying much, much too hard to make the lyrics of his precious book match the melody in the song, like a child reading a Dr Seuss book to Metallica. On top of that (though I can't verify it as I know nothing about the book), I've heard from fans of Burzum that Varg Vikernes mispronounces much of the book's outdated dialect, so apparently he isn't even being that loyal to the material in the first place. \n\nNow we come down to the part where I sum up what I think of the album, and I must admit I\u2019m hard-pressed for a definitive rating. On the one hand I think Varg\u2019s struck an interesting balance of music, ideology and atmosphere, but there are places where these three things begin to struggle with one another and some of the craftsmanship is buried as a result. There are definitely songs here to impress Burzum fans, even those of the \u201ctr00 kvlt\u201d early Burzum fanatics, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the awkward decisions I brought up earlier, and I felt this album could have been very tight if a couple of songs had been left off the bill entirely. However, this album is definitely a complement to a whole work and branches off from where Belus and Fallen left off. I feel, in the end, as if the album was worth it, if only for a handful of tracks. It\u2019s definitely worth a few listens. When I first heard the album, I didn\u2019t like it, and a few other listens seemed at first to solidify my opinion, but eventually I started to come around to it. Umskiptar is an album that is a bit hard to swallow, but there is certainly material here that even an old Burzum fan will appreciate. I give this album a 15/20. When it\u2019s good, it\u2019s really good, but its dragging points are still a bit hard for me to accept. \n\nRECOMMENDED SONGS: \nJ\u00f3ln: A song of heavy black metal proportions that packs a punch as the album\u2019s opener. Some of the riffs here sound as evil as any riff from Burzum\u2019s self-titled album, and here the spoken word vocals work with the music instead of against it. Varg makes use of his ability to vary a song and progress it with finesse and subtlety. \n\nValgaldr: Bizarre riffs very unorthodox and unexpected for Burzum are used here amidst a twisted structure whose mix of low and very audible bass riffs, hypnotic, harmonic sustain notes, and chanted vocals create an otherworldly dream for the listener. The song has a depth to it and a variance to it that makes it an easy standout. This is a song of melancholic meditation for those minimalist nuts. \n\nGulaldr: Coming in right after the beautiful Surtr Sunnan, this song continues the last stretch of the album in sleepy hypnotic guitar chords and scales. Though written very simplistically, the atmosphere is perfect here, and though the song lasts ten minutes, I feel that it deserves the run time it got, even though it took me a few listens to accept it. The spoken-word verses are perfectly varied by a simple vocalized chant and a haunting melody. Underlying electric guitar tones come and go and crash over the listener like waves. My only complaint here is that the song that follows Gulaldr is completely unnecessary and takes away from the already well-established atmosphere. I wish Gulaldr had been the last track of the record.\n",
        "\n\"In every night there's a different black.\" \n\nThis line encapsulates the essence of Burzum\u2019s fourth full length album, Filosofem (meaning, \u201cPhilosopheme\u201d). Filosofem is an expression of Varg\u2019s overarching philosophy. Musically, that philosophy is grounded in the concept of difference and repetition. Progressions slowly, almost without being noticed, differentiate over extended durations of time. The listener is lost in a paradoxical middle ground where sound seems to be simultaneously stagnant and morphing. While Varg plays with difference within repetition on all Burzum recordings, it is here that the technique is employed in its purest form. Each song contains only a small number of progressions that that are repeated for extended periods of time with subtle changes slowly but surely emerging. \n\nThe same concept is expressed through the lyrics and accompanying stories (the booklet contains a number of stories in Norwegian; the English versions are only available on the Burzum website). Filosofem is a concept album loosely based on the interplay of light and darkness: two oppositional forces that contrast each other but are also dependent on one another for meaning. Varg explores this interplay at both the literal and metaphorical level. For example, the story \u201cCreeping and Crawling, Rustling and Fluttering\u201d and the lyrics to \u201cBurzum\u201d explore the way in which night and day reveal the world through two oppositional filters; the story \u201cMouse Town\u201d and the lyrics of \u201cGebrechlichkeit\u201d describe a decrepit world in which the darkness has been removed and only light remains, an allusion to the Christian God of light.\n\nFilosofem also marks a sharp change in production and execution for Burzum. The production is much cleaner and sharper than on prior recordings. It is the first Burzum album that does not in any way qualify as raw black metal. All the instruments are crystal clear and the performance is tight. While prior albums had a sense of uninhibited fervor, Filosofem is a work of precision. Every note is on point and every tap of the drum is on time. Even Varg's signature howls are replaced with a more reserved, raspy growl. All these changes could hint a gross misstep in Burzum's development, but as a matter of fact, the cleaner style is the perfect medium for the songs of Filosofem.\n\nThe album can be divided into two uneven parts. There are the opening three tracks which are lively and vivid; then there are the closing three tracks which are slow and contemplative. Certainly, there are multiple ways to interpret the relation of the two parts of the album, but considering the emphasis on light and darkness, it feels as if the first three songs represent the day and the last three songs represent the night.\n\nThe opening half contains a trio of energetic cuts of black metal. \u201cBurzum\u201d (which is actually the first song Varg wrote for Burzum) centers on a hypnotic riff that slowly slithers back and forth while hollow keys release notes like drops of water. Background layers of guitar sneak in and out of the composition. Then, in an absolutely exquisite moment, the notes are rearranged and Varg shifts from growl to spoken word. It\u2019s a subtle but highly effective change that typifies the compositional techniques used throughout the album. \"Jesus Tod\" is absolutely enthralling. After a wicked guitar intro, the song breaks out into a ravenous pairing of sprinting drums and scathing guitars. Though there is very little change in the progression, the song still manages to build toward cathartic overflows. On \u201cErblicket die T\u00f6chter des Firmaments\u201d a hard rocking riff and a steady drum beat are accompanied by ghostly keys. The sharp and steady percussion provide all three songs with a dynamic, fluid movement that hints at primal drives such as hunger and lust.\n\nThe second half of the album is quite a shift. The percussion disappears and the songs become even more repetitive. The centerpiece is the massive, twenty-five minute ambient piece \u201cRundgang um die Transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t,\u201d which begins in a curious and playful tone but slowly shifts into a deep and solemn mood. It\u2019s like watching a spiritual epiphany unravel; the melody initially seems simple and banal, but by the end has transformed into a brilliant choir of shimmering keys. Yet, even at its most profound, the music remains gentle and solemn. \u201cRundgang\u2026\u201d is bookended by \u201cGebrechlichkeit\u201d parts I and II, which are basically the same song, only the first one has vocals while the second is instrumental. \u201cGebrechlichkeit\u201d (meaning something along the lines of \u201cfrailness\u201d) is a highly depressive song that centers on somber progressions on guitar and keys. The lyrics describe a world in which darkness is gone and only light remains\u2014the world of the Christian God. In lieu of the dynamism of light and dark, all power is drained and one left in a state of absolute frailty. The song effectively depicts the Christian heaven as the most horrific realm fathomable. By blanketing the multifaceted, paganistic \u201cRundgang\u2026\u201d with the hopeless monotony of \u201cGebrechlichkeit,\u201d Varg resoundingly depicts the spiritual superiority of paganism over monotheism. \n\nBlack metal has always been a genre tightly bound to ideology, but few black metal acts have created an album that is as ideologically complete as Filosofem. It provides a doorway into a paganistic worldview, in which darkness and light are at constant play with one another. Appropriately, Filosofem is a significant moment not only in the musical development of black metal\u2014the employment trance-inducing repetition has caught on like wildfire\u2014but also in the philosophical development of the genre. Filosofem maintains the critique of Christianity that is so central to black metal, but moves beyond the contrarian obsession with Satanism and into the realm of paganism. While Filosofem is by no means the first black metal album to take up paganistic themes (to one degree or another they\u2019ve always been around, at least in the Norwegian scene), Varg\u2019s use of repetition is the perfect tool through which to express an ideology that is grounded in the cycles and patterns of nature. For achieving a total unity of ideology and sound, it is fair to describe Filosofem as a perfect black metal album. \n\n(Originally written for http://deinos-logos.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nAs we all know by now, this album is an interpretation of the old norse poem \u201cV\u00f6luspa\u201c. This being kept in mind and also minding the amount of tracks on this record, one could come to the conclusion that this one might not be too much about the single songs, but should probably be seen (and rated) more as a continuously flowing entity in eleven chapters, so to speak. After about twenty listens, I am fairly sure that this is a legit approach, leading a bit further than a conventional song-by-song-analysis. Thus I will make my rating depend mostly on the question, whether or not Varg manages to \u201cconvince\u201c me with his approach to this poem (and not, for example, whether this album is still black metal or not). So: Does \u201cUmskiptar\u201c catch the density and the somewhat crude, metaphysical aura of the V\u00f6luspa? Do the songs link organically, resulting in something, that is more than the sum of it's parts? Do the instrumentation and the vocal arrangement appear to be appropriate?\n\nWhile both \u201cBelus\u201c and \u201cFallen\u201c satisfied me in an instant, \u201cUmskiptar\u201c certainly needed time to reveal all it's qualities to me. However, it still seems a bit like a mixed bag in terms of the crucial questions above: Large parts of the album really manage to transport a certain mood or atmosphere which is distictively different from other BURZUM albums and \u2013 as far as I\u2018m concerned \u2013 matches the sentiment of the underlying poem very well. Especially the last quarter of the record, mocked as being too lengthy, barren and plain boring by other commentators, simply struck me; reminiscent of great \u201cstoryteller folk\u201d such as CURRENT 93, Varg really evokes some strong emotions as the album constantly calms down, clinging out in some minimalist, yet powerful acoustic chords during the stellar \u201cGullaldr\u201d (easily the best song here). With that being said, I don\u2019t think that Varg\u2019s spoken word parts are boring or unfitting. All I could complain about is the still too bashful use of his singing voice: there are still some treasures to be retrieved.\n\nHowever, other parts, such as the utterly underwhelming opening track \u201cJ\u00f3ln\u201d, rather feel like uninspired leftovers from the \u201cFallen\u201d sessions, corrupting the albums attempt to appear as a compact unity. Looking at the album as a whole, I\u2019d even say that it\u2019s mostly the more \u201cmetal\u201d parts that tend to come across a bit dull and superfluous (apart from some songs like \u201cValgaldr\u201d, that are capable of transfering the albums general atmosphere into the structure of a metal song). By the way: the production isn\u2019t helping to rectify that impression: While sticking to the the overall recipe of \u201cFallen\u201d, it appears to be even more transparent with all instruments being extremely distinguishable in the sound spectrum, unfortunately resulting in a rather driveless (and even a bit clinical) sound, not quite matching the requirements of heavy metal. Oh, speaking of heavy metal: Am I the only one who got a certain MANOWAR vibe while listening to \u201cHei\u00f0r\u201d (the bass!) and \u201cN\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr\u201d (the first minute of \u201cSpirit Horse of the Cherokee\u201d)?! Nevermind...\n\nLet me conclude by saying that maybe on the next album Varg\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d (which is what \u201cUmskiptar\u201d translates to; well, it means \u201cMetamorphoses\u201d, but what the heck...) will be complete, with him serving us pure, otherworldly folk music \u201cthe BURZUM way\u201d (similar to what ULVER did with \u201cKveldssanger\u201d), while \u201cUmskiptar\u201d remains \u201cjust\u201d a very good album with a few minor flaws, mostly resulting from a certain half-heartedness in terms of composition.\n",
        "\nVarg Vikernes, undoubtedly one of the most notorious members of black metal culture, created this album while he was on parole from prison. Due to the fact that Varg now had many more instruments at his disposal than synthesizers, he was back to making black metal. The last black metal album he had made was 1996's Filosofem which was considered by many to be one of the greatest black metal creations of all time. So the question flowing through everyone's head upon Varg's return was \"Can he continue writing good music?\" In answer to that question, Varg created this album and gave a victorious \"Yes!\" in response. This is actually the album that got me into Burzum's music, and contains some fantastic black metal. \n\nThe opening track starts this album off in a rather odd way. The sound effects appear to be glass bottles dropping onto a cement floor. Despite the peculiar introduction to the album, \"Belus' D\u00f8d\" brings out a black metal punch. The song is rather forgettable once you hear the other tracks that the album has to offer, but it's still solid. \"Glemselens Elv\" is where the album really picks up. The guitars on this song create a beautiful atmosphere and make a sonic wall which is both enjoyable to listen to and excellently crafted. While the song is rather long, it's one of the stand out tracks on the album. The song even has some clean vocal moments which are actually used very well. \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\" has a speedier pace and makes for a nice transition to keep the album moving. \"Sverddans\", while a short song, has a powerful guitar riff and the vocals add to the dark atmosphere of the track. \"Keliohesten\" adds some more faster-paced moments to the album and \"Morgenr\u00f8de\" adds more to the album in the form of atmosphere. The album ends in a colossal wall of sound created by guitar layers. It's a completely instrumental track, but is another highlight of the album to me due to how entrancing the song is. \n\nThere are plenty of other qualities about this album which made me enjoy listening to it. For instance, I enjoy the guitar tone a lot more on this album than on Filosofem. It's far less droning and not quite as loud. Vocally, Varg sounds a lot more like a typical black metal vocalist. This is also a plus to me because the vocals on Filosofem were another reason I didn't enjoy the 1996 album. \n\nA couple of the song lengths might put off some listeners as well as the repetitive nature of the guitars throughout the album. While I don't mind the repetition due to how atmospheric and well-crafted the guitar-work on this album is, some people will become annoyed with the lack of change. The only faults I find in this album are that the opening track served no real function and there are some moments throughout the songs which can be a bit tedious, even for me. Other than these slight faults, the album is solid and far more enjoyable for me than Varg's 1996 creation. I recommend this album to anyone who wants to get a taste of great black metal.\n",
        "\nOne might think that a band like Burzum would have some amazing demos. Heck, his early albums are raw enough as it is and the production is so minimal that some would argue that they aren\u2019t far from demo quality to begin with. The primitive style of early Burzum works so well with a raw atmosphere that it seems as if it could sound really powerful in an even rawer form. Well, that all works better in theory then it does it practice. Burzum\u2019s first demo is a complete and utter disaster; a god-awful performance and comically bad recording that renders several classic tracks intolerable. \n\nThe recording quality is just awful and not in a \u201craw\u201d or \u201cnecro\u201d way, but rather in a \u201cthis guy had no idea what he was doing when he recorded this,\u201d way. The sound quality is horrendous. The music constantly fades in and out, increasing and decreasing in volume, sometimes to such a degree that music almost goes silent. There is also a ton of hiss and other interference. Furthermore, the guitars just sound awful. They lack punch and are overly jittery as if the battery on the amp was about to run out of electricity. Furthermore, the demo is totally instrumental, which means there are no vocals to distract us from the abdominal performance. While these are excellent compositions, without Varg's ravaging screams they lack a center point. \n\nThe ambient track \u201cChanneling\u2026\u201d fares no better than its metal brethren. There is a highly irritating and constant clicking noise in the background; it\u2019s as if a metronome was accidentally left on while Varg recorded the track. There is also a random burst of distortion that washes out the sound. The keyboard itself doesn\u2019t sound awful, but it is fairly one-dimensional and lacks the girth Burzum's later keyboard recordings have.\n\nThere is really no benefit to this demo. The execution is awful and the production is horrendous. This does not create a dark or evil atmosphere or anything of the sort. Time would be better spent listening to the studio versions for a hundredth time than listening to this demo even once. \n\n(Originally written for http://deinos-logos.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nI can almost see him grinning wickedly through his thick beard. He never was like most of the people and he never will be. In his mind utter nonsense struggles with utter brilliance, with the latter fortunately conquering over his musical aspirations. Just a year after releasing the acclaimed \u201cBelus\u201d, Varg Vikernes is back with yet another blackmetal monument, ready to re-establish himself for good in today\u2019s musical events.\n\nOnly this time, the enthusiasm of \u201cBelus\u201d has given way to the warmth of Burzum\u2019s new record \u201cFallen\u201d. Although presenting a harsher sound than its predecessor, the feeling of the opening riff from \u201cJeg Faller\u201d is the feeling of knocking the door of an old acquaintance where, no matter how long it\u2019s been since last time, you just know it\u2019s a place you\u2019ll always feel comfortable. With \u201cValen\u201d things get a bit more heavy metal, its epic tunes repeating themselves till they get stuck in your mind; this is emotional uplift, THIS is norse blackmetal.\n\nThere really isn\u2019t anything new here, it\u2019s just production that helps Varg\u2019s sometimes chanting, other times whispering vocals come to surface and accompany the distorted ones. And the marching drums can now be heard and give depth to the soundscapes like those encountered during the journey of \u201cBudstikken\u201d. And if at some points he becomes predictable as in \u201cEnhver Til Sin\u201d or the ambient outro track, it\u2019s OK, because only the fact that he\u2019s still here, still sharing some of his musical genius with us, is invaluable by itself.\n\nVarg was on his own back then and still is on his own right now. A sole mind that will never fit in. He knows it. And his music is a resort for him as well as for some of us who also think from time to time that we might not fit in. Wow, and I think I just found the word that could describe the wholeness of \u201cFallen\u201d. A resort\u2026\n\n\nOriginally written for:\n\nhttp://theantifleshnimbus.wordpress.com/\n",
        "\nOne of the virtues of Burzum has been the project\u2019s constant reinvention. While the overarching vision has remained relatively stable, Varg has constantly found new ways of expressing it. As a result, every Burzum album has its own distinct identity\u2026 at least, until 2011\u2019s Fallen. While the album did contribute some minor changes to the Burzum sound\u2014lots of clean vocals (good) and hyper-compressed production (not so good)\u2014for the most part it felt conspicuously typical and predictable. The song structures and melodies felt all too similar to what we have heard on prior albums. While the songwriting was for the most part strong, Fallen was ultimately, \u201cone for the fans.\u201d\n\nWhile Fallen raised concerns that Varg was reclining into a comfort zone, Umskiptar does everything possible to dispel them. Umskiptar is anything but safe; it is conceptual, experimental and on a number of occasions, quite strange. The lyrics are taken from the Poetic Edda V\u00f6lusp\u00e1. The primary voice in the poem is a female prophet who is summoned by Odin to tell the future of mankind. The prophet proves her powers by retelling the story of the creation of the cosmos as well as telling Odin of his own personal search for knowledge. She then warns of the coming of the battle of the gods, which will lead to the death of Baldr, the bravest of the gods, and Odin himself. However, out this destruction comes the rebirth of the world in a more beautiful state than the first. \n\nUmskiptar means \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d and that is certainly what this album undergoes. It begins with faster, more upbeat pieces, but continuously transitions to slower and bleaker compositions, unraveling toward a bare core. The album is bookended by two primordial ambient pieces (which are way better than the god-awful closer on Fallen) which tie together the cyclical nature of the album. \n\nMusically, Varg tries out a lot of different ideas on Umskiptar. He provides a wide range of vocals including chants, hums, dry rasps and spoken word. While Varg\u2019s growl sounds a little aged, his clean vocals are surprisingly warm and textured. The percussion is sharp (the jittery patterns on \u201cJ\u00f3ln\u201d are especially impressive) and the bass is full and bouncy. The guitar work is pretty typical Burzum; lots of hypnotic melodies, spidery scales and repetition. Umskiptar sees Varg play around with undistorted guitar, which is basically absent from prior Burzum releases. \n\nThe result of all these new sounds is a quite varied album. Most of the conventional metal tracks are excellent. Tracks like \u201cJ\u00f3ln,\u201d \u201cHit helga Tr\u00e9\u201d and \u201cGalgvi\u00f0r\u201d center around emotionally charged melodies that entrap the listener through repetitious patterns and impassioned vocals. The more experimental tracks are less consistent. These songs, which are mostly near the end of the album, lack percussion and sometimes even bass. Of these, the penultimate track, \u201cGullaldr,\u201d is the highlight. The song consists of nothing more than clean guitar and a mix of clean and growled vocals. The somber folk melody and gentle singing recall Ulver\u2019s neofolk classic Kveldssanger. On the other hand, \u201cGalgvi\u00f0r\u201d is tough to sit through. Varg chants in a strange, quasi-operatic style while the same progression is strummed\u2014sometimes with and sometimes without distortion\u2014for over seven minutes. \n\nWhile there are one too many tedious tracks on Umskiptar, it is predominately an engaging recording. It is like watching a primitive opera or hearing vivid story being told by the fireside. Varg effectively uses the variety of vocals and gradual deceleration of tempo to reflect the process of destruction and decay that occurs in the Edda. Certainty the most ambitious of Varg\u2019s post-prison recordings, Umskiptar is an exciting and creative album. While a few belaboring moments hold the album back a bit, it\u2019s nice to see that twenty years after releasing the self-titled debut Burzum remains a creative force. \n\n(Originally written for deafsparrow.com)\n",
        "\nEver since the notorious Varg Vikernes has been released from prison in 2009, his musical taste seems to be drifting away more and more from the old Burzum style and is in search of something different, a new horizon to cast, and a new journey based on his vast knowledge of the Norse mythology.\n\nThis record, \"Umskiptar\", means \"Metamorphoses\" in old Norwegian and is the third full length after his \"freedom\", and on this record it seems that Varg is becoming more experimental. The music is more obscure, cinematic, and spiritual. All the lyrics are basically based upon the epic poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", telling stories of creation and epic journeys in the deep darkness of the north.\n\nThe music reflects these ideas significantly; the guitar riffs and drumming are still very hypnotizing, but this time in a different way and gives you a feeling of an ancient breeze blowing in your face, especially with songs such as \"J\u00f3ln\" and \"Galgvi\u00f0r\". The bass line also plays an important role in this procedure, though the bass line isn't quite clear in some songs.\n\nProbably the most important element on this record is the vocals. Vikernes is trying to create a feeling of storytelling, trying to take you through a journey with his spoken vocals echoing deep in his chest, creating a shiver as if you are standing in the presence of ancestors. Such a feeling can be generated in most of the songs, but clearly in \"Alfadanz\", \"Hei\u00f0r\", and of course the highly powerful, yet incredibly simple intro \"Bl\u00f3\u00f0stokkinn\".\n\nThe element of experimenting is clear in the song \"N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr\", which is an ambient outro that is simple and extremely deep. After listening to the whole album, this outro will make perfect sense and it only shows Varg's tasteful addition. No outro would fit this record as this one does.\n\nSo this record basically creates a brand new atmosphere, completely different from his previous records and even different from anything found in the metal scene. It could be the dawn of a new era, the era of \"skaldic\" metal.\n",
        "\nThis album, at least to me, is not black metal. While it does have some black metal tendencies, such as harsh vocals and black metal tremolo picking, it's pretty much more folky than it is black metal. Hell, there is not one blast beat to be heard anywhere on this album, and most of Varg's vocals are clean singing. Some of these tracks do not contain ANY drumming, and I'm not talking about the ambient intro and outro...\n\nThis is definitely, as stated previously, NOT a black metal release. So people are going to be complaining about it. Saying something like \"Burzum's not kvlt anymore! He's a poser!\" ...or some stupid shit along those lines. Well, in reality, one could have seen this transition coming with his dark ambient prison albums \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" and \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf.\" The folkiness of the music sort of went away with \"Belus,\" with which we saw Burzum going back to a raw, lo-fi overall black metal sound. This album got some bad reception, however, probably from the newer Burzum listeners who hadn't heard his older black metal records. The muddy production and repetition shocked them. However, a lot of them seemed to come around when \"Fallen\" was released just about a year ago. That album had much better production, while still maintaining the rawness of the music. That album, at least to me, contained some more folk influence than \"Belus\" did. This new Burzum record, entitled \"Umskiptar,\" is a complete change from the aforementioned two. Already, I have seen very negative reviews about it. While some points those reviews made about this album are agreeable, most aren't. \n\nFirst off, let's talk about the overall sound of this. Again, it is very folky. The drums, when even played, are completely different than any other Burzum releases. There are no blast beats... At all. Not one, zip, nada! There are actually a few tracks not counting the intro \"Bl\u00f3\u00f0stokkinn\" and outro \"N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr.\" The tracks on this album that are devoid of drums are \"Hei\u00f0r,\" \"Galgvi\u00f0r,\" \"Surtur Sunnan,\" and \"Gullaldr.\" These are all fairly repetitive folky pieces, primarily \"Galgvi\u00f0r,\" which actually contains one of the best riffs on the entire album. Another thing that shocked me was one of these tracks used keyboards!!! Keyboards had not been used on a Burzum album since 1999's \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf.\" The track on this album which boasts some keys, is \"Alfadanz.\" It is the third track on the album. This track is one of my personal favourites, it has some of the most memorable riffs on the album, and it not boring at all. Plus Varg's clean vocals really shine here, along with his quiet, raspy whispers. Keyboards are heard in the intro of this track, as well as again at around the 7 minute mark, and they are played until just a little passed the 8 minute mark. And the track after that, \"Hit helga Tr\u00e9\" features some of the album's most memorable riffs overall. Amazing tremolo picking in this one, and again, Varg's clean chants with his raspy black metal vocals are great.\n\nNow, there are some negative aspects of this album, that I feel need to be addressed... One is that the album tends to focus more on quantity than quality. Now, this album does feature some very good quality songs, in terms of atmosphere and structure. However, 11 tracks on a Burzum album? This is Varg's longest album, clocking in at around an hour and five minutes, only about a minute or so longer than \"Filosofem\" was. This album, however, does contain the most tracks on a full-length Burzum record. These songs are also all very repetitive. This leads some people to call this album \"boring.\" Although I don't fully agree with that, I sort of see where they're coming from. This album does tend to drag a little bit. One more negative for me personally would be the lack of drumming in some parts. No blast beats? Fine, I don't mind that. However, some of these tracks that contain no drumming at all would benefit a little from a drum line here and there. \n\nNow, just because this is not a black metal record, does not mean it should be overlooked. Anyone who was impressed with \"Belus\" and \"Fallen\" will most likely eat this up! This really shows a different musical side to Varg, and exposes his folkier side very well. Solid record with only a few flaws.\n",
        "\nI must admit that I have always hesitated to check out the music of Varg Vikernes and Burzum. I simply can\u2019t ignore the fact that he is a criminal mind that has burnt several churches, murdered his ancient band mate and promoted strange racist opinions over the last decades. I don\u2019t want to support this kind of human being in any financial, promotional or whatsoever way. \n\nOn the other side, I heard so many comments about his music and became somewhat curious. It\u2019s a well known fact that insanity and genius can be really close. I ultimately fought my inner demons and tried to be open minded enough to have an idea of this guy\u2019s musical universe. I decided to listen to his new record \u201cUmskiptar\u201d after many reviews I have read about his last two regular studio records \u201cBelus\u201d and \u201cFallen\u201d that he released when he got out of prison.\n\nConcerning this record I must admit that this is much ado about nothing at all. This is simply overlong atmospheric ambient music with somewhat intriguing poetical Norse lyrics. The artistic approach is authentic and works very well in the beginning of the record but it gets redundant after a while. The emotions are there but they are not deep enough from my point of view and are rather repetitive, too. Despite its title, there are no big metamorphoses or any kind of surprises on this record. \n\nFrom time to time, the sleepy flow is then interrupted by some short blackened metal passages that I would not call traditional black metal. To my big surprise, these moments are the most emotional ones on the album and kept me listening to this record to the end. The harder stuff like \u201cHit Helga Tr\u00e9\u201d or the refreshingly short \u201c\u00c6ra\u201d featuring disturbing vocals between floating and spiritual vibes and aggressive or desperate undertones as well as slow but heavy riffs with some disturbing sound is where Varg Vikernes convinces me the most.\n\nThe strongest songs are definitely in the beginning with the airy, progressive and yet angry and dark \u201cJ\u00f3ln\u201d and in the end of the record with the melancholic epic grower \u201cGullaldr\u201d that invites you to dream yourself far away. These are the moments when I begin to understand why this controversial personality is also respected by some for his musical input. Even though the record has a very coherent flow and a clear guiding line, there are too many lengths in here that can\u2019t compensate for the boring moments.\n\nIf there would only be more quality tracks like this one on the album instead of pure chewy quantity, I would really feel the need to check out his older works after all these years. But overall, this is only an average record with very few sprinkles of genius that is hard to sit through after all. There is almost as much boredom as there is potential in this album but I think that it might grow on me as time goes by and it your listening experience also depends a lot on your personal mood, too. This record should have been released in autumn or winter time. Apart of the numerous Varg Vikernes fanboys, fans of blackened ambient stuff and pagan metal might like this but anybody else shouldn't follow the hype. In the end, sixty-six percent seem to fit perfectly to the lyrical topic, the music and the man behind this release.\n",
        "\nIf it were my goal to convince anyone why they should or shouldn't like the latest Burzum album -- or any album for that matter -- I'd be failing so miserably that I'd put Steve Urkel's dress sense to shame. That is not, and was never the point of exercises like these. I am, however, here to tell you that Umskiptar is not only a good album, but is also very much worth listening to. This is, of course, my opinion; and as such it can be taken, left behind, remembered, forgotten, spat upon, laughed at, argued with or ignored. Just remember that yours can, too.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to realize that Varg's interpretation of songwriting and music in general is that it should be a reflection of the self. As such, a more honest and heartfelt production quality will usually result in an accurate and soulful portrayal of the composer, provided it's executed effectively. Vikernes' mastery of this practice is what has always set Burzum apart, especially as far as the music is concerned. Since most of the metal world has already made up its mind on who Varg Vikernes is and what he's about, i.e. a self-absorbed, rambling ex-convict who, although at times is capable of creating or saying something profound, lives primarily in the shadow of a small handful of great albums, and who was unfortunately brainwashed into thinking that people of other races are less intelligent human beings, should it be of any surprise that the more \"in touch\" with himself Varg becomes, the more his music will do kind of the same thing he does -- that is, to wander from time to time in order to eventually find small fragments of lost wisdom and enlightenment under the metaphorical rock or bog...? From the eternally long and meandering tracks such as \"Rundtg\u00e5ing Av Den Transcendentale Egenhetens St\u00f8tte\" and \"Tomhet,\" to long album beginnings such as the new \"Alfadanz,\" self-portrayal through music is what Vikernes has always done, especially in his most brilliant moments of creativity. Umskiptar is one of those moments.\n\nIn a strange sense, Burzum has always been a very childlike project. Most children, given a marker or a crayon or a paint can or a piano, will simply do whatever the fuck they want with said utensil. Generally, it's not until the adults come in, criticize the shit out of what they're doing, tell them all the right and wrong ways to do things or just tell them that they suck and shouldn't be wasting so much time, that the children stop becoming children and start acting like adults. By this, I mean to say that they all start acting the same. The incredible thing about Burzum has always been that it sounds like nothing else. Aside from being quite skilled at playing a wide variety of musical instruments, arranging songs and sound production, Varg's unquestionable ability to simply not give a fuck what anyone thinks is, far and away, his strongest and most valuable attribute. Whether this prized characteristic is used as a strength or a weakness is all up to him.\n\nAmidst the many arguments over which Burzum album is best, some people tend not to realize that Burzum, Aske, Det Some Engang Var, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem were all recorded within a year's time. Regardless of personal favorites, all of those albums are very different from one another, and Umskiptar is finally an album about which the same thing can be spoken. Two awesome characteristics that come into play right off the bat in \"J\u00f3ln,\" the second track off Varg's latest effort, are his added emphasis on layering soft vocals and shrieks on top of one another (and the offsetting of the two), and his ability to write hooks capable of reeling in Moby Dick after just one attempt. After \"J\u00f3ln,\" comes what might be the make-or-break song for many of the album's listeners, because the aforementioned \"Alfadanz\" is roughly nine minutes of anticlimactic folk music that Elves could only write if they were tripping on acid with Jerry Garcia. Remember, the wandering must come as a predecessor to the enlightenment, both for the artist and his observers, so don't go skipping over it. In the next handful of tracks, \"Hit helga Tr\u00e9\" returns to Burzum-ic form with slow, dark and heavy riffs coupled with some serious tremolo melodies, as \"\u00c6ra\" takes the listener into what might be their final decline in interest before leading into Umskipar's latter and more consistent half.\n\nAlong with the next handful of tracks come a few more interesting attributes that help continue to make Umskiptar much more interesting than its post-prison predecessors. One unique aspect is the feeling of sacredness the album gives off. Most should concur that old Norse is a beautiful language, and the way Varg chooses to deliver his sixty-six stanzas of poetry gives off the impression that the lyrical content means a lot to him. Another attention-grabber is the way the bass guitar is incorporated into lengthier tracks such as \"Valgaldr.\" Not unlike early Ulver, the long-prodding bass notes don't really seem to care about what the rest of the instruments are doing and, as a result, send the listener into a relaxing dream-like state. This hypnosis of hypnagogia doesn't possess the exclusively electronic programming of past albums, and instead is accompanied by some pretty slow, evil-sounding riffage.\n\nVarg has said in the past that he typically uses album openings to tire the listener so that they may be more susceptible to the more spiritual and atmospheric elements of the concluding tracks. Though Umskiptar possesses nowhere near the amount of outward intensity of Burzum's past works, the attentiveness that is given to the record's first eight tracks really does affect the way the closing will be received. To put it simply, \"Surtr Sunnan\" and \"Gullaldr\" are packed full of pure emotional honesty that all point back to one thing: Varg Vikernes. Say what you want about him, but at least the man admits his many faults. He knows he's far from perfect, and that his music is as well. Quite frankly, that's the beauty and uniqueness of it, especially given that we live in a world where people just aren't comfortable with themselves at all. Some have an impossible time admitting their own faults, while others spend the majority of their day pretending that they have none. The truth is, whether we like to admit it or not, we hate. Other times, our actions simply aren't in line what we know is the right thing to do. If you take a quick view of the world in which we live, you're just as likely to see that this is undoubtedly the case as you are to witness hypocrisy that surrounds it all. We may be neither inherently good nor evil, but we are inherently dishonest. So what's to be done when someone comes along admitting all of this to himself and to everyone else? Do we shun him for not pretending to be perfect like the rest of us, or do we listen? \n\nOriginally written for MetalReview.com\n",
        "\nThough the title of Varg Vikernes' ninth full-length album as Burzum might translate to 'Metamorphoses', I was actually surprised that Umskiptar was more or less a direct continuation of the aesthetics found on its excellent predecessor Fallen. Last year's From the Depths of Darkness collection of re-recordings revealed a Vikernes in touch with his career roots, but this new material traverses more or less along the same, wintry course of his ancestry he explored with the prior full-length; only the folksy swagger is more pronounced, the binary use of black metal snarls and cleaner chanting more evenly distributed and the whopping 65 minutes of composition heavily favor a slower to middle pace with an occasional transition into faster rhythms (only on the guitar).\n\nThe lyrics here are drawn from V\u00f6lusp\u00e1, the creation myth of the Poetic Edda, and the music is well attuned atmospherically to its ancient script, nearly each piece flowing like an individual river of ice carved from the solid rock and hardships of antiquity and approaching apocalypse. I absolutely love the guitar tone Vikernes uses through this record, soaked in just enough distortion to create these shimmering effects in both the chords and tremolo picked patterns that feel as if you're being blinded by the sun and its glare off a morning frost. The percussion is likewise appreciable, from the minimal, echoed thunder of the drums in the intro \"Bl\u00f3\u00f0stokkinn\", to the stick-like repetitions used to support the airy chords and bass of \"J\u00f3ln\" and beyond to the steady clap trap rock rhythms found in something like \"Valgaldr\". The bass also adds to the album's naturalistic feel, with a stolid plunk to it that is alternated with swooning, melodic fills. Entwined with both the harshness and soothing of the vocal lines, Umskiptar creates a coherent 'live' impression, as if you were experiencing its performance at some rustic, log-built tavern on a sobering, somber afternoon.\n\nDespite this, there is a good deal of variation present on the record, necessary for such a large swath of content. Some tracks offer more of a narrative melodic structure accompanied by only a few of the instruments at any given time, like \"Hei\u00f0r\" with its alternating floods of bass and guitars; or \"Surt Sunnan\" with its drawn out, cyclic phrasing and deeper, 'storytime' vocal sensibility. One of the pieces, \"Gullaldr\" takes this to the extreme, ten and a half minutes of vocals and guitars only, with a few sequences of rasping, and I did feel like it was a drag on the album's momentum as a whole. The more metallic oriented tracks fare better. \"Hit helga Tr\u00e9\" with its lilted step, textured vocals and crunched rhythms, or the memorable \"J\u00f3ln\" and its hypnotic, swaying stream of guitars, stuffed to the brim with subtleties in the multi-tracked vocals, bass, and the subdued, shifting patterns of the rhythms. Varg even emits a fit of deep, pitch shifted laughter in there which took me by surprise. The pianos and doom-like licks in \"Alfadanz\" were another treat, as well as the yawning ambiance and whispers of the closer \"N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr\".\n\nI must say, though, that in lieu of a rather strong start, Umskiptar definitely lost my attention span at several points throughout the run time. I realize the subject matter demands a rather grandiose treatment, but I could not help but feel that the songs could have been broken down into highlights and fillers. I think a few instances of more accelerated rhythms interspersed through the record could have helped in breaking up the sullen monotony manifest by the longer hymns. Also, the drizzle of the more atmospheric guitars can also grow tired, far better are the pumping, active sequences like the opening to \"Valgaldr\" and I wish that these had been spread into the nether regions of a few of the tracks so that there could be some unexpected turns. As it stands, a number of the songs open strongly and then spiral down into a less mesmeric facade, and in the end I did not experience quite so positive a response as I did with Fallen before it.\n\nStylistically, I admire what Burzum has brought to bear these past few years. I realize that, in addition to the usual detractors of his statements, actions and beliefs, there exists a sizable crowd of naysayers who, like some cloud of irrepressible gnats, will carp and moan at every record the guy releases that isn't Hvis Lyset Tar Oss II, many times without even listening for more than a few seconds. The light at the end of the cave might forever elude a few of these folks, but beyond that, Burzum has always been about evolution, even from the first few records to, say, Filosofem, and it's clear he has no intention of endlessly repeating himself for the remainder of his career. Just not going to happen. Umskiptar is not so much a complete transformation of Fallen, perhaps, but it expands upon a few of the tropes present there, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, and even if it's not one of his most consistent efforts, there are still enough alluring, atmospheric tracks here that fans of raw and simplistic black or folk/black hybrids should pursue it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAfter hearing \" Fallen\", I was not disappointed at all with Varg keeping true to what he does; True Norwegian black metal in your face. With that being said I went to my local store a few months later and found another Burzum album thinking, I didn't know he was making another for this year. So of course, without looking at the back for song titles, I definitely assumed I was in for another treat. A treat alright, more of a surprise to find out it was one of those danged re-recordings.\n\nLuckily it didn't turn out as bad as I thought. 1. Few of my favorites were on there, \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\", \"A Lost Sad Forgotten Spirit\", and \"Key to the Gate\". 2. The instrument track recording was still the same raw power as before with original recordings. So that right there was a huge plus in my book. Now towards the \"not so kind\" part per say, the overdubbed voice recording. I just feel that a lot of parts were not timed so well like the actual classic recordings. Some instances, I swore I heard key of the microphone in parts of songs, almost like those real primitive do it yourself black and death metal bands that record in their bedrooms. And lastly, his dubbing smudged with the music, pretty much cutting the sharp edge to the assault he dealt with those songs twenty years ago.\n\nSo there you have it, more or less a \"greatest hits\" album, versus an original album. For anybody that is new to Burzum, I'd highly recommend getting the \"Burzum\", \"Aske\", and \"Det Som Engang Var \" to hear these timeless classics. Actually hear these songs in their truest form, not re-recorded.\n",
        "\nFor the record, this is going to be a review written by a Burzum fan, for Burzum fans. Please kindly leave all complaints with the MetalReview.com public relations department, or simply move on if the band doesn't already interest you.\n\nThe very least that anyone can say about Varg Vikernes is that he's been a man of his word ever since his prison release. Since last year, he's graced us with Belus and Fallen, which were far from disappointing to already-converted lovers of Vikernes' music. The second release of this year, From The Depths of Darkness (not \"Deeps\"), features re-recordings of the most coveted Burzum works pre-Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Thankfully, \"War\" was left out of the mix.\n\nTo these ears, Varg chose to use the exact same instrumentation that exists in the original recordings, but changed the album's mixing drastically. The result is old Burzum songs recorded in Hvis Lyset Tar Oss fashion. What would a Burzumite want more than to hear the old tracks recorded with the same intensity of what is one of the most powerful and influential black metal albums of all time?\n\nAlthough From The Depths of Darkness is as perfectly justifiable as it is enjoyable, it lacks some of the \"magic,\" if you will, that exists within the confines of the original Burzum/Aske and Det Som Engang Var LP's. Varg Vikernes once said that the whole point of the musical rebellion that is black metal is not to care about brands of instruments, types of studios or the \"in\" music at the time. To quote him:\n\n\"A few mistakes make the music more alive and personal -- it simply gives the music some \"soul\" and originality, so I never bothered to correct anything. The music on the Burzum albums is simply an honest and sincere, unvarnished and clear representation of me. Certainly I am not flawless or without mistakes, so neither is my music.\"\n\nA musical visionary, Varg is absolutely correct in his practically prophetical statement as a sign of things that were to come in the extreme music industry. If there's one thing that's true about what most musicans consider traditional soul music, it's that the music is certainly not without mistakes. That's what gives the notes character. It wasn't the notes that were being played that attracted so many people to Burzum in the first place. It was how they were being played. That's what was so revolutionary about black metal at the time, and that's what separates extreme metal from any other form of rock music today.\n\nVikernes didn't exactly fail to live up to his standard of what is soulful music on these re-recordings, but two of the trademark sounds of the original recordings -- the wails of a soul in dire agony in the original \"Spell of Destruction,\" for example; and the incessant pounding behind the drum kit featured in songs such as \"Ea, Lord of The Depths,\" and \"My Journey To The Stars\" -- are completely missing in this supposed re-vamped re-recording. Still, it's nearly a worthy sacrifice given the increased intensity of the sharp-as-hell riffage on all of the new album's songs.\n\nSo if you're stuck trying to choose which song versions you prefer, you've missed the point of this release entirely. The most positive thing about From The Depths of Darkness is that we now have both recordings. If Hvis Lyset Tar Oss was too short for you, you now have an additional seven songs you can enjoy. If you think it's blasphemous and too profitable to be trve, nobody is forcing you to listen to this. On top of that, if the ferociousness of the old Burzum with such a fresh production is a sign of what's to come, do not be surprised if Burzum manages to pull an Album of the Year contender out of its hat, or burn down a church or two. Hell, at this point, anything is possible. \n\nOriginally written for MetalReview.com\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s an old saying that you have to be happy with what you have to be happy with. Sometimes that\u2019s easier said than done. After his arrest and conviction for the murder of Mayhem guitarist Euronymous, Varg Vikernes attempted to continue the Burzum project from behind bars. The only instrument at his disposal was a low-end Casio keyboard. Varg valiantly\u2014or pitifully, depending on one\u2019s perspective\u2014tried to create an ambitious neoclassical opus on the shoddy machine. The result is pretty torturous. Though the compositions on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs are stellar, the sound quality is comically bad, resulting in an unforgettable low point in Burzum\u2019s career. \n\nFirst of all, it should be emphasized that the compositions themselves range from good to great. Dau\u00f0i Baldrs allows the classical influence on Varg\u2019s compositional techniques to stand front and center. His use of repetition and counterpoints has classical roots, though it\u2019s usually easy to overlook behind the wall of fuzz and maddened screams. Dau\u00f0i Baldrs gives a fair nod to those roots and can help elucidate the classical influences on other Burzum albums. The arc of the album is also impressive. Dau\u00f0i Baldrs tells a mythical story and the movement of the album from start of finish succeeds in expressing numerous dramatic shifts. \n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that regardless of how good these compositions are, the execution is for the most part awful. One can only go so far with Casio. Even Beethoven\u2019s 9th sounds cheesy when played on a Casio, so Dau\u00f0i Baldrs doesn\u2019t stand much of a chance. Some of the samples are just excruciating to listen to. The oboe sample sounds like a cartoon quacking goose, the cello sample is really nasal and grating and the xylophone sample will pierce your brain. The piano sample is the least offense; sure, it sounds cheap, but at least it is an adequate simulacrum of a real piano. The \u201cstring section\u201d sample is also tolerable.\n\nThus, the relative tolerability of the tracks correlates to their avoidance of the more annoying samples. The final two tracks rely predominately on the piano and string section samples and consequently, are fairly moving. \u201cIlla Ti\u00f0andi\u201d is a slow, somber piano dirge that expresses a deep spirit of melancholy. \u201cM\u00f3ti Ragnarokum\u201d is another somber piece that centers on piano and strings, cultivating a tragic sense of resignation. Though the nasal cello sample pops up a few times, there is enough quality here to overcome it.\n\nHowever, the first four tracks are damaged beyond repair. The title track opens the album with a series of laughable cello, war drum and oboe samples that raze all semblances of taste and standard to shreds. \u201c\u00cd Heimr Heljar,\u201d with its goofy percussion and bombastic strings, would work well as the background music for a commercial for the local renaissance fair. The other two tracks don\u2019t fare much better.\n\nDau\u00f0i Baldrs is a waste of good material; beneath the corny Casio samples are very impressive compositions. Varg affirmed this when he rerecorded the title track\u2014the most unbearable track on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\u2014on Belus. Expressed through the power of blazing guitars, bass and drum, the piece took on brilliant new life. Recently Varg rerecorded tracks from the self-titled debut, Det Som Engang Var and Aske. Doing so was a waste of time, since the songs on those albums are already excellent. However, a rerecording of Dau\u00f0i Baldrs would be a worthy project. If Varg ever decides to complete such a project, the result will be something special. Until that happens, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs will remain a sad reminder of what could have been.\n\n(Originally written for http://deinos-logos.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nAske (which is Nordic for \"ashes\") probably has the most iconic album cover in all of black metal. Fantoft Stave Church torched down to its bare frame. The cover is a declaration of war on Christianity; a propaganda tool for the recruitment of new comrades in the war against the foreign faith. However, the album doesn\u2019t live up to the cover. Musically Aske is the weakest recording (spare the demos) in the entire Burzum cannon. It is unclear what Varg was trying to achieve with this EP, but on the whole it would have to be deemed unsuccessful. \n\nFor whatever reason\u2014probably either due to Varg\u2019s arrest or his financial disputes with Euronymous\u2014Aske was released prior to Det Som Engang Var, in spite of the fact that it was recorded after. Musically, the EP does not sway too far away from the sound of the first two full lengths. Varg brought in Samoth (Emperor, Zyklon-B) to play bass, making Aske the only Burzum recording with a guest musician. The effect is negligible. While the bass is slightly more audible than on the prior two albums, Samoth is not required to do anything out of the ordinary. It\u2019s unclear why Varg recruited Samoth for this EP.\n\nAske consists of three tracks; two originals and one rerecording. \u201cStemmen Fra Taarnet\u201d is a fast paced, bouncy attacking piece in the vein of \u201cFeeble Screams from the Forest Unknown.\u201d It shifts back and forth between firing verses and dizzying choruses all bathed in Varg\u2019s scathing howls. However, the track randomly cuts off at the six minute mark. What happened here is anyone\u2019s guess. Perhaps the producer screwed up on the final cut. Maybe the physical recording got damaged. Maybe Varg couldn\u2019t afford more recording time. Whatever the case may be, \u201cStemmen\u2026\u201d is like reading a 2/3 of a novel only to realize that the final few chapters fell out of the book; a very frustrating experience.\n\n\u201cDominus Sathanas\u201d is the highlight of the album; a slow, doomy piece with symphonic layering. Melodious lead guitars swing back and forth, backed up by a thicket of fuzz. Eerie chants sneak into the backdrop and a single vile scream tears through the entire landscape. This is the sort of sound I expect Dau\u00f0i Baldrs album would have had if it had been recorded properly. \n\nThe closer is a rerecording of \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit,\u201d which originally appeared on the debut. This rerecording is inferior. The dynamic of the song was presented brilliantly on the debut. The composition shifts between faster, feverish passages and slower, haunting passages. The original version is played at a faster pace, which allows the quicker sections to slash the listener like a Nordic midwinter breeze. Consequently, the slower stretches mark a true contrast and the melancholia is palpable. On the rerecording, everything is slowed down. This means the difference between the passages is not sufficiently accentuated. Thus, the rerecording lacks some of the dynamism of the original. \n\nUltimately, Aske will draw you in with its controversial cover, its historic mystique and perhaps its obscurity. (If you ever see it at a record store pick it up because it is damn rare and you will probably never see it again). However, as a musical document it basically a footnote in the otherwise stellar Burzum catalogue. \n\n(Originally written for http://deinos-logos.blogspot.com/)\n",
        "\nA few months after recording the impressive and somewhat erratic, but nonetheless impressive debut album \u201cBurzum,\u201d a more focused Varg Vikernes returned to the studios to record \u201cDet Som Engang Var.\u201d Taking the positives of the debut and building upon them, Burzum\u2019s sophomore release is an absolute masterwork of black metal. \n\nWhat is interesting is that the songs for \u201cBurzum,\u201d \u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d and \u201cAske\u201d were mostly written within a year\u2014and not in the order that they were released. So some of the material on \u201cDet Som\u2026\u201d is actually older than the material on the debut. However, it does appear as if experience in the studio did Varg some good, as \u201cDet Som\u2026\u201d displays much more craft in arrangement and layering than its predecessor.\n\nThe production remains raw, the riffs remain razor sharp, and Varg\u2019s screams are still the sound of unbridled madness. However, plenty of new details have been added, giving \u201cDet Som\u2026\u201d a much more textured sound. To begin, the production is a little deeper, meaning there is even more room for the riffs to buzz and resonate within the recording. Vocally, Varg supplements his powerful screeches with soft, gentile chants eerie spoken word passages. For a love of melody this album is a treat, as Varg churns out one imperious melody after another. \n\nCompositionally, \u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d constantly offers the listener something new while maintaining a telos. The album starts from the darkest depths, with haunting and subdued ambient piece followed by the vicious \u201cKey to the Gate,\u201d which bursts onto the stage with venomous hatred. After several waves of terrifying riffs and annihilating vocals, the song sinks down into a slow, doomy middle section. Varg builds the tension with brilliant craft, setting the scene for stunning moment when the song takes a complete 180 and bursts out an absolutely glorious guitar solo and majestic riff. \n\nThe next 20 minutes are overloaded with magisterial sounds that summon images of pristine Nordic landscapes. On \u201cEn Ring Til Aa Herske\u201d Varg takes his time, slowly developing a trance-inducing tunes toward its ecstatic peak. \u201cLost Wisdom\u201d is the catchiest song, with a rock-like rhythm and folk leads. The album winds down with the dark, somber and eerie \u201cSnu Mikrokosmos Tegn,\u201d whose longer, interweaving structure recalls \u201cMy Journey to the Stars,\u201d but is even more ominous. As if dragged down to the depths from where it came, \u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d ends as disturbingly as it starts.\n\n\u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d also contains some of Varg\u2019s first ambient pieces. The closer \u201cSvarte Troner\u201d is extremely disturbing, with soft, off-putting moans hiding behind spooky melodies and waves of white noise. \u201cHan Som Reiste\u201d consists of an excellent medieval melody\u2014the kind of tune Summoning has made a living off of.\n\n\u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d is the closest one can get to the \u201cother planes\u201d of existence Varg speaks of in \u201cLost Wisdom.\u201d It\u2019s as if the listener is pulled out of his or her modern life and brought to a mystical, arcane world. Yet, like all dreams, the journey has to end and the listener is drawn back into the bleak reality of modern civilization once again. \u201cNo bear, no wolf, no troll. Breathless.\u201d The beautiful dream of \u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d comes to an end and only an ideal remains\u2014an ideal totally disconnected from the modern world. What once was is lost.\n\n(Originally written for http://listenwell-nocturnal.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\n1992 is the year that the second wave of black metal began to take shape. While Quorthon had already laid the foundation with the first three Bathory albums and Mayhem had been revving up for a while, it was the trio of Darkthrone\u2019s \u201cA Blaze in the Northern Sky,\u201d Immortal\u2019s \u201cDiabolical Fullmoon Mysticism\u201d and Burzum\u2019s self-titled debut that really kick started golden age of black metal. These albums are dark, raw, evil and chilling. Burzum\u2019s debut is no doubt the most extreme of these albums.\n\nStructurally and conceptually ambitious, \u201cBurzum\u201d already gives a peak into the complex artistic vision of Varg Vikernes. At the same time, this is an album that is as raw as they come. Varg takes Bathory\u2019s buzzing guitar sound and sharpens it to an absolutely piercing pitch. Keen as these riffs are, they still fill a lot of space through resonation and humming feedback. The minimalist production does not stop these riffs from sounding big and full. This creates the perfect landscape for Varg\u2019s maddening screams. Varg\u2019s vocals on the first three albums are simply without peer. He sounds like a crow that just returned to its nest to find its eggs missing and is pissed the fuck off.\n\nConceptually, the album swings high, but it doesn\u2019t always hit the mark. The album is split into two sides: \u201cSide War\u201d and \u201cSide Winter.\u201d Beyond being a fairly asymmetrical pairing, the two sides do not really fit the bill. For example, the dreamy ambient piece \u201cChanneling the Power of Souls into a New God\u201d appears on \u201cSide War\u201d while the thrashy headbanger \u201cWar\u201d appears on \u201cSide Winter\u201d. More problematic, the album doesn\u2019t have the greatest flow. Unlike some of the masterfully arranged albums that Varg would produce in the upcoming years, the debut is somewhat of a grab bag. There are three longer, emotionally complex tracks and there are three shorter, visceral tracks. While these differing types of tracks could conceivably be interwoven, Varg doesn\u2019t actually manage to achieve that here. \n\nVarg really shows his brilliance as a songwriter on the two closing epics, \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u201d and \u201cMy Journey to the Stars\u201d. These two songs do feel like side winter with sweeping melodies buzzing around like gusts of ice cold wind. The tracks interweave between fast, pulsating rhythms and slow, tribal beats, constantly bringing new sounds into their web. Actually, the headbangers are damn good too. \u201cWar\u201d is a great tribute to the Bathory song of the same name and \u201cSpell of Destruction\u201d is absolutely riveting. Varg\u2019s devastated, retaliatory wails on the later track are some of the most beautiful and horrifying vocals in the history of black metal.\n\nStill, when it\u2019s all said and done \u201cBurzum\u201d mostly feels like a collection of innovative songs from an excited and inspired young artist, but it doesn\u2019t quite feel like an album. The structure is too erratic and the songs sometimes clash. While this doesn\u2019t make the songs themselves any less excellent, it does put Burzum\u2019s debut a notch or two below its sequels. \n\n(Originally written for http://listenwell-nocturnal.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nAfter a long 11 years Varg is back with Belus. My first impressions of this album were pretty good, sounding almost like a mix of Filosofem and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, which is undoubtedly a good thing. The album starts off with some sort of introduction which sounds like ping pong or something, then shortly after comes Belus' D\u00f8d. Now this IS a good track no doubt, obviously a metal version of the song Daudi Baldrs with some Jesus Tod thrown in there. Each track stands out in its own way, nothing really sounds the same, and you even get some clean, spoken vocals in some songs such as Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning, Morgenr\u00f8de, and Glemselens Elv, which is a nice change.\n\nThe production on this album is raw, cold, and exactly what you'd expect from a Burzum release. Nothing is hidden behind anything and you can hear each instrument very well. The guitar is the usual buzzsaw riffing you would expect, the drums sound great, and you can actually hear the bass guitar, and of course, the vocals. They have evolved so much since the self-titled album (obviously). They sound like Filosofem without all that distortion, which is something interesting to hear coming from someone who sounded like a screeching morbid cat on the self-titled (don't get me wrong, I love that album and the vocals on it). \n\nAs for the lyrics, I've looked around and I can't seem to find the English lyrics, so I can't really review them, but I do know one thing and that's the more you listen to this album, the more you will learn about it. You probably won't catch everything the first time as there are some very memorable riffs here such as Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning and Sverddans, which sound very thrashy considering what we are use to. These songs are fast, angry, and have some pretty cool riffs. Some songs even have solos (such as Sverddans) which I thought was a pretty nice addition.\n\nI am kind of disappointed that Varg left out some of the ambient tracks that were originally suppose to be included, which he stated in a review on his website, but I am quite happy with the overall length of the album, and depending on how good those tracks were, I cannot judge if they would drag the album out or actually have a purpose. But personally I enjoy ambient stuff, so I am curious. \n\nI gave this an 80 because it's nothing incredible or original, but it's the same old Burzum you would expect, except done very well. If you like black metal or if you would like to get into black metal, this is one of the albums I would recommend. It's easy to get into and fairly accessible. \n\nI am happy with this release and I think it's a nice addition to the Burzum library. Worth checking out. \n\nHighlights: Belus' D\u00f8d, Glemselens Elv, Sverddans.\n80%\n",
        "\nWhat I am having here is a severe attack of conscience and reason. On one hand I\u2019ve been a Burzum fan for nearly 20-years and generally enjoy most of what Varg Vikernes has artistically put out. That said I\u2019m not a fan of any artist redoing a past album, especially one that had a charm and resonance like the early DSP Burzum work. So here in From the Depths of Darkness we see Vikernes offering his take on the old classics \u201cas they were originally intended\u201d. I\u2019m also not a fan of this statement; if they were originally intended this way, they should have been implemented as such accordingly back when with no excuses. I fully understand financial constraints, equipment issues, what have you; this adds to the serendipitous airs around the Burzum, Det Som Engang Var and Aske EP and, in my opinion, would not have been revisited in such a manner. Still, I admit to a certain excitement when I heard some samples of some of the tracks simply for, if nothing else, posterity\u2019s sake.\n\nWhen I first heard the Burzum album in 1992 I was astonished at how low-fi, thinly-produced and downright primitive it sounded, from the haphazard instruments to the insane vocals. After one shocked go-around I had another listen and found the absolute destitution and bleakness Vikernes was going for in that album, and it was magical to say the least. What we have here in this compilation is, at best, a retooling that was both unnecessary and wasteful, while the worst case scenario shows Vikernes shamelessly cashing in on some of the infamy of his name. While the latter is possibly less of the true picture in my eyes, I do hear a very interesting reworking of some classic tracks. However, the original sound of \u201cEa, Lord of the Depths\u201d has some of the most horrific and tempestuous black metal sounds ever committed to vinyl, sickly disturbing production values notwithstanding. With this new version, for example, the polished and buffed essence that was the early Burzum work has been casually \u2018repaired\u2019 where a bandage was clearly not needed or wanted. Whereas the 1992 Varg Vikernes was a 19-year old visionary back in the demo days, the older man who now sees those classic tracks as inferior might have miscalculated his own value and worth in the classic Norwegian movement of the early 90\u2019s. While he has never been shy with his opinions about himself or the world around him, I\u2019m guessing this is how the 38-year old man views his vision some 20-years past.\n\nTo be perfectly honest these tracks pale in stark comparison to the originals, and while I understand this is the desired effect Vikernes had in mind the originality and honesty has lost some luster throughout. Yes, the tracks are widely of better quality, sonically and by design, subtle nuances and alterations be damned. Somewhere in this exhaustive foray lies the blatant picture of Varg Vikernes becoming one of the mass milieu of artists that are not only a dime-a-dozen but widely uninteresting and too similar for any real resonance. The vocals, now a breathy all-too familiar gasping, attempt to overshadow the agony and despair of the originals, failing in every aspect accordingly. The simplicity and immaturity of the original issues can never be replicated and, in all good conscience, should never have been tampered with in such a fashion. In typical straight-forward inquiry - what is the point? \n\nI admit to liking some of the visions that Vikernes has fashioned for these tracks in the modern day, even though I find total and causal reticence in this record. What I will ultimately praise him for is that, while his current take on these songs might not sit well with long-term fans, he is keeping the original issues in print and not pulling them from circulation. Had he done this Varg Vikernes would have committed the ultimate sin in everything the Burzum name stands for in the present day. Aside from that, I\u2019m not so sure these tracks are necessary in the line of releases, but they do provide a reasonable alternative that longtime fans will undoubtedly find insipid or egregious.\n\nDon\u2019t take it seriously and you\u2019ll be just fine. \n\n(Originally written for www.MetalPsalter.com)\n",
        "\n\"Come on, Varg. Seriously? We don't hear from you for 11 years and now you're popping out two albums within 12 months? You're smothering us, man. At least the intro this time doesn't sound like Charlie Sheen's breakfast table.\"\n\nSo we have another Burzum album, humorously titled Fallen. Its a black metal album, no getting around it, but it's highly questionable whether it's really a Burzum album. A lot of hardcore fans think there hasn't been a real Burzum album since '96, and as much as I'd like to believe they're wrong, Varg isn't exactly disproving them here. Rumors that the once-great Count Grishnackh has gone soft are flitting about everywhere and yet the man continues to take steps away from his glory days. Question is: Are these steps a forward march? Or is Fallen just an ironically-titled rung on the church burner's ladder downward into irrelevance?\n\nThe latter will seem most likely at first. Disappointment will most likely set in within the first few listens. The album isn't horrific, but it's not exceptional either, and it's difficult to accept that from such a high-expectations name as Burzum.\n\nFallen is an extremely light album in comparison with the dismal gray of classic Burzum. It's less coldly desolate and more wooden, gnarled. On his website Varg commented that he'd produce this album as one would produce classical music, which is an interesting concept\u2026but also completely contrary to the basic concepts of black metal (shoddy production is a must if you wanna be kvlt). This particular recording method makes everything sound crystal-clear, which in the case of the genre is A BIG NO-NO. It's not the poppy gloss of Abigail Williams, but the riffs lose a lot of their misty distortion and become more bright than bleak. The vocals have for once called shotgun and are near the forefront of the mix, which unsurprisingly shatters their former ethereal quality. Varg exponentially increases his use of chanting and clean singing, and he sings quite often. Yeah, we're talking about the guy who howled his black lungs out on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Hearing it without that signature fogginess, Burzum's music as a whole loses a lot of its old krieg persona. It's not pretty, but it's not ugly either. So what happened? Something about the murder conviction and prison (probably the wife and kids, too) has aged Varg, and dealt a severe blow to his angst. The man's no less capable, just far less intense. Its apparent the grim 20-something Varg is gone. In his passing he left behind several pivotal black metal albums, an infamous legacy, and the vaunted name of Burzum. An older Varg is now picking up the pieces, middle finger nonchalantly raised.\n\nFallen is definitely not the Burzum of old. It's a shame that this means the loss of the unholy shrieks and the cold fury of albums like Hvis Lyset, but it also adds a sort of subtle folkiness to Varg that manages to stay well away from cheesy \"cascadian\" bullshit. There's still a bit of that old tinny feel to the guitars, and raspy screams are far from absent, but the songwriting comes off as almost catchy, as if it's not meant to rape your soul. The motifs Varg uses are melodic, forming segments almost like choruses, most noticeably in the V tracks, \"Valen\" and \"Vanvidd\". The hypnotic repetition is nostalgic rather than depressive, and the closer \"Til Hel og tilbake igjen\" is a valiant attempt at tribal ambient. Varg is no longer a pissed-off youth hefting a mace in front of a mirror. He's become black metal's Dylan or Springsteen, swearing a solemn but unspoken oath to practice his craft till he keels over. This is Varg nearing 40, recording in his cabin rather than his basement, playing to dark folk tales and a fireplace instead of to Satanic seances and a burning church. This is black metal given unapologetically from a jaded Norwegian mountain man to his unsuspecting audience.\n\n-originally written for www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nRevisiting the past is a dangerous game, but it is doubly so when one's past works are considered sacred relics of an artistic genesis of sorts. This is the dilemma that most would like to thrust upon Varg with the release of what are largely his most widely influential works in a modernized format. Granted, the Burzum concept of modern could be analogized as the difference between late medieval Gothic architecture vs. early renaissance era architecture with a similarly Gothic feel. That is basically what \"From The Depths Of Darkness\" is, a rehash of olden warriors with swords drawn who just happen to have discovered gun powder and are being supported by a handful of primitive cannons.\n\nAnyone with a clear memory of the sonic characteristics of \"Burzum\" and \"Det Som Engang Var\" would expect any kind of a compilation of various songs from each respective album to be a jarring affair, shifting back and forth between various low-fi manifestations in a manner not all that dissimilar from Darkthrone's largely panned compilation \"Preparing For War\". This re-visitation, however, is a frighteningly consistent one in respect of production, coming off almost as though the exact same mixing levels and settings that gave us the recent \"Fallen\" were employed here. While definitely dark and misty sounding, it has a mellow smoothness to it that contrasts with the olden frost character of the early 90s.\n\nBut the real departure to behold here is in Varg's vocal interpretation. Whether it be a shift in sound preference or a necessity resulting from a fully matured voice, what is heard on here is more akin to recent Darkthrone releases where a low end growl replaces the high pitched shrieks of Burzum's past. With it comes a sense of moderation of character, something that is probably alien to most long time adherents to the cult of the 2nd wave. To put it plainly, the former overwhelming sentiment of agonized suffering has been replaced with a somewhat vindictive, but largely focused anger that is likened to a wiser man still being pissed off at the modern world.\n\nBeyond the upgrade in production practices and a revamp of the instrumentation on the ambient keyboard number \"Channeling The Power Of Souls Into A New God\" into a slightly more menacing, guitar dominated beast, there is little change to be observed here. For all the talk of Varg allegedly profaning his former fits of brilliance, this is largely an inoffensive tribute to his own past. In fact, the biggest flaw that this album suffers from is that it doesn't really go much further than remembering the past. This is not something that can be counted as essential, nor is it some unworthy fit of pandering. It is more a sufficient rendering of already explored territory, and whether it was a necessary one largely terminates on whether one prefers the new production practices that were adopted after Varg left prison.\n",
        "\nBack in the primordial sludge of black metal's evolution in the early 90s, particularly in Norway, there was a bit of stylistic ambiguity as to what direction things would go, as was largely the case with the early thrash efforts from a decade prior. Whereas Metallica's and Slayer's debuts, along with the early Exodus demos still had a strong remnant of the NWOBHM sound, so too did the early efforts of Mayhem, Darkthrone, Immortal, and the subject of this historical excursion Burzum with the still largely thrash infused death metal scene that many of them came out of. Suffice to say, the respective 1992 releases in the style were marked by an obvious nod to the past, be it the one lived by Bathory, Hellhammer, Venom or Sodom, and the self-titled debut out of Varg Vikernes' one-man project was no exception.\n\nTo be clear, \"Burzum\" does strike a bit closer at the streaming, flowing, melodic tremolo character that has come to typify the style than \"Diabolical Fullmoon Mysticism\" or \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\" do, but it has a near equal musical memory of the 1st wave 80s conventions and slight tendency towards the more occult oriented death metal sound that predated the gore-obsessed scene of the early 90s. But the greatest point of contrast is Varg's utterly raucous almost to the point of torturous vocal display. Unlike the deep grunts or goblin-like ravings that typified most contemporary offerings, what is heard is very human sounding, albeit an exaggerated dose of what a human being in a state of utter suffering would sound like. For many, it's a bit too much to handle, as was likely the case with a number of early grindcore/goregrind releases, but it generally suits what is going on musically, despite being a little too high in the mix at a few key points.\n\nFrom one song to the next, it is clear that while Varg is very much situated in the musical climate of the year, his own unique quirks and fascination with droning and ambient ideas are very present. In addition to a rather creepy and dissonant sounding keyboard instrumental in \"Channeling The Power Of Souls Into A New God\", contrasting with the largely contemplative and restful numbers that were on subsequent albums, many of the riffs contain tuneful tremolo melodies that are very different from the largely thrash infused riffs common to Bathory's 80s offerings and earlier Mayhem works leading up to this point. Particularly in the cases of \"Ea, Lord Of The Depths\" and \"My Journey To The Stars\" these lead guitar ideas have an almost singing quality to them, and were probably very influential in shaping what became the early offerings of Gorgoroth.\n\nThis album's outlier status doesn't end with the rest of the early Norwegian scene, but also takes shape with regard to subsequent releases. With the remnant of earlier thrash infused blackness from the 80s comes a somewhat more virtuosic musical character, resulting in more ideas being jammed into shorter songs and having more of an accessibility factor for anyone not necessarily into the drawn out, droning character that became standard with \"Transylvanian Hunger\" and \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\". There is also a short thrasher in \"War\" that sounds a bit closer to a late 80s Mayhem song, complete with a guest guitar solo slot by Euronymous himself, channeling his usual influences from the Slayer and Bathory formula and shredding in a disjointed, choppy fashion for the last 30 seconds of the song. It's auspicious in that it's probably the closest to an out and out throwback to the 1st wave, in contrast to a set of songs that, while still tied in with the older paradigm to an extent, are far more advanced towards the commonly recognized sound than otherwise.\n\nPure in a musical sense, this is the weakest of the early Burzum full length albums, for no other reason than that it's the least consistent from one song to the next. The focus is definitely on the English translation of the band's Tolkien black-speak name of darkness, but the darkness is not the peculiar niche that Varg is more readily know for. From a historical standpoint, this album is probably the most monumental as it seems to be the most widely imitated, especially by some prominent Norwegian bands that cropped up soon after. But for all the distinctions that anyone else may or may not make, this is definitely a top notch representation of the seemingly endless wellspring from which many rawer black metal bands continue to flow.\n",
        "\nFor a artist whose middle name might as well be controversy, Varg's music has been more of an exercise in cultural revivalism and historicism, rather than an endless stream on contrarian blasphemy. Much like his old and perhaps former friend Abbath, he has tended to be off in his own world, obsessing over the lore of the olden Norsemen. There is, however, an exception in the Burzum catalog that brings up the question of cultural conflict, and it is lodged right smack in the midst of an impressive spurt of musical creation over the span of a single year. And this lone statement of dissent is so blatant that completely divorcing its musical contents from the implicit ideology is not feasible.\n\nKnown to English speakers as ashes, \"Aske\" carries with it the visual memory of a rather infamous act of arson. The political subtleties of a nation with an official state church supported with state money should be taken into account, along with the obvious differences between Nordic culture versus the British Isles and the Alpine mainland in terms of self-identity. When this occurs, it becomes possible to empathize to a certain extent with the consistency of a man who has taken a total plunge into ancient paganism, and it definitely speaks to a genuine passion expounded in the lyrical content of this EP.\n\nWhile the general production character of this is among the more frostbitten and cold sounding of Varg's creations, and there is a fairly strong remnant of the early black metal scene's ties to death metal, it is also one of the less intricate as well. Part of the plainness that these songs exude is tied to a one-dimensional expression of agony, lacking the depth of later works where keyboards and a denser atmospheric aesthetic complement the frosty bite of the guitars, let alone the serene and contemplative ambient elements. Nevertheless, even as a straightforward aggressive slate of minimalist black metal, this fares well for its ability to balance intensity with a disciplined sense of organization.\n\nThe contents of the first half of this endeavor, labeled as the \"Side Hate\", contains some of Varg's simplistic offerings. \"Dominus Sathanas\" has an older metal feel, almost along the line of an early 80s vibe, and provides a haunting atmosphere that is a bit denser that the remaining contents found on here. \"Stemmen Fra Tarnet\" goes through more of a mid-paced route with a chunky main riff that, again, conjures up images of the early days of metal, like a Hallhammer emulation with a rawer vocal interpretation and a higher end guitar tone. There isn't really anything surprising to speak of here, just a consistent pattern of basic musical ideas with a neurotic vocal impresario.\n\nThe second half, dubbed \"Side Winter\" contains a long faster song in \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" that largely runs parallel to the droning frost of \"Under A Funeral Moon\". This is where Varg's woeful wails really fit into the equation and push the arrangement rather than clash with it, though it is important to note that despite the similarity to Darkthrone, that the instrumental character is a bit higher fidelity. A good point of contrast would be between hearing a storm from under a sheet of ice (post 1992 Darkthrone) versus walking in the midst of it (pre-\"Filosofem\" Burzum).\n\nThe mixed reactions that most present day black metal fans tend to have to this is understandable, despite the ideological credentials it touts on its cover. This is Varg's simplistic music minus the varied genre hybridization that started soon after, and in a less aggressive dose than the debut self-titled album. But taking the music for what it is, this is a solid musical effort, one that is strangely aware of its own futility. Abbath definitely had a point when explaining his own non-involvement in the arson and acts of vandalism, stating that \"If you burn a church, the government will just build a new one, with our tax money\", and in just 4 or so short years, the Fantoft Church was standing once again as if it had never been gone. From my standpoint, music trumps politics, as the former never really fails in its attempt while the latter defines itself by failure. And its by the musical merits that any album, be it a tribute to futile dissent, or a strange statement with a brain-splattered cadaver on the cover, that it should be judged by.\n",
        "\nI was quite perplexed when the announcement was first made for this compilation of repurposed and repackaged Burzum tracks. I'm sure I am not the only one. Those who follow Vikernes' in interviews will likely recall his statements to the nature of wanting his music to originally sound as bad as possible, with the worst instruments, the worst microphones and the worst amplifier; to really let the talents and the emotions of the individual shine through in the crudest array of musical devices. So it seemed to me a bit 'flip flop' that the early recordings Burzum and Det Som Engang Var would ever retrieve a treatment such as this one. But really, when it comes down to the line, it is Varg's music and his business what he does with the music. If the man wants to record his dishwasher on an endless loop for 80 minutes, then I'm sure there would be an applicable market...\n\nDespite this hesitation, From the Depths of Darkness does not sound all that 'polished' or all that bad. Varg had mentioned he was never happy with particular elements of the original recordings, like the vocals, and thus he's gone on to adjust them without losing most of the music's primal underpinnings in translation. These sorts of releases are rarely much good for me. An artist might come along and blow the original recordings out of the water (like that recent Satan's Host collection); or simply complement the originals with a fresh coat of paint (Destruction's Thrash Anthems) that remains entertaining; or flop along uselessly with some unwelcome new vocalist present on the classics (Exodus' Let There Be Blood). In the case of this record, it's the same man, the same vision, only tweaked with a few components he wanted to hear, but may have muddled up in the original incarnations of the songs.\n\nNow, this is not the entirety of Burzum or Det Som Engang Var, but a selection of tracks affixed with a few ambient intros and interludes. As such, one should not go into it expecting the same play order, and the alternation of the tunes creates a mildly different atmosphere. The guitar tones are more propulsive and brighter in pieces like \"Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\" and \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\", and the screams a bit more brash. If anything, he's updated the level of production to that of his more recent efforts Belus and Fallen: not at all the sort of poppy, studio glamors one might expect, but a solid representation of where he's at today. To be sure, I don't think those original albums could EVER be replaced. Their importance to millions of fans, followers and clones is not in dispute, and part of their charm was their moral distance and the dry, downtrodden architecture of sound. If there is anything noticeably missing from these new versions, it's that same, somnolent spiral of agony.\n\nThe ambient pieces here are really just used to extract their ancestors from the originals, and create a separation. The best example is right up front, as the emergency-warning sounds that once inaugurated \"Feeble Screams...\" have been sliced, and a new intro \"The Coming\" is given its own, sparse, admittedly worthless existence. Same with the low, cavernous ambient rumbling of \"Sassu Wunnu\" which is placed before \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\". \"Call of the Siren\" is a bit more substantial, with some warped guitar loops and residual ambiance, but it too feels barren even for Burzum. I could have done without all of these, but as far as the more important metallic tracks, I found that some were still pretty exciting despite the facelift. \"Key to the Gate\" sounds positively thrashing here. \"Channeling the Power of Minds into a New God\" has a nice buzz to the two droning guitars. \"My Journey to the Stars\" sounds quite atmospheric and powerful...\n\nTo sum it up: Do you love these Burzum tracks so much that you're excited for their marginal mutation into a fresher form, with none of the dreaded onus of studio glitter or overproduction? Then From the Depths of Darkness will not prove a disappointment. Or does your devotion reach so exceedingly far that the very notion of this is of heresy and alienation? Well then, you probably aren't going to derive much amusement from this album. Personally, I'm on the fence. The new recordings were not completely offensive or unwelcome, but I just don't see them as necessary or all that compelling, since they largely follow the originals and only deviate in a few of their underlying details. I'm much more interested in his new ideas and material (I quite liked Fallen), and so I hope he will turn to that fertile territory next, rather than some future splicing and retreading of, say, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt was an interesting time, those days in the early 1990s where something new and cold was about to burst out of Northern Europe, provided one was actually privy to what was going on. Most who were of a mind to listen to what was generally accepted as accessible metal noted the changeover in the thrash metal scene and the complete demise of the typical 80s approach to heavy metal. But off in darker places was a lone magician who decided to pick up every instrument relevant to the genre and start crafting a series of masterpieces, 5 in all, in but a single year. It is difficult to decide which is more daunting; the number of albums put together, or how radically far apart from each other they are in overall character.\n\nOf these dark, trance inducing creations, \"Det Som Engang Var\" stands as one of the more varied offerings. It generally embodies the dense, ambient character of latter offerings, yet contains a strong remnant of Varg's death metal past as well. Mingled amongst the hypnotic broken chord passages that sound like frost covered memories of the rock bands that originally employed them are a good number of creepy, chromatic passages and pounding low end grooves that, while not out of character for a number of more recent black metal outfits, is in direct contrast to the orthodoxy that was emerging out of most of Norway's other prime movers. The closest comparison could be made to \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\", which was admittedly almost as much a death metal album as a blackened one, but here the presentation is not quite as jagged and crispy, more in the manner of a blistering snow storm rather than a punishing mixture of sleet and snow.\n\nBut perhaps more unique in the general scheme of things is lyrical content that dispenses with overt irreverence in favor of a sort of pagan historicism, mixed with some fantasy based lore ala J.R.R. Tolkein. Varg's agonizing wails are very suited to the part, playing up the role of a haggard storyteller who decries the victory of his adversaries, while longing for a more tranquil place to return to. Even the contrarian \"Key To The Gate\", replete with angered discord both vocally and musically, makes time for melodic passages that buck the trend of pure rage. \"Lost Wisdom\" and \"En Ring Til \u00c5 Herske \" visit a place of fragmented grooves, somewhat reminiscent of a slowed down death/thrash character in the mold of Hellhammer, but giving way to a layered atmosphere of vocal chants and thicker guitar drones, making for a multifaceted presentation that was alien even when put next to the contemporary works of forward looking death metal acts.\n\nAmid the brilliant mixtures of heaviness and atmosphere, the serenity that slowly seeped its way into the Burzum paradigm begins to show itself here, though often it is still distorted by the wicked tendencies that Varg was carrying with him from his one time cohorts in the 2nd wave. \"Han Som Reiste\" is the only pure representation of the dreamy instrumentals that would come to define Varg's keyboard music, but traces of it are also to be found on \"Den Onde Kysten\" and \"Svarte Troner\" with horrifying elements mixed in. \"N\u00e5r Himmelen Klarner\" actually showcases the ambient approach with distorted guitars employed and brings out a sound that is almost in line with the a melancholy instrumental variation on an early Mercyful Fate tune.\n\nAs odd as it may seem, this is actually among the weaker of the earlier studio offerings put out under the Burzum name, primarily because its heavily transitional nature comes off as a bit muddled at times. There isn't really one distinct moment of weakness to point to, just a general sense of a process of maturing that hasn't fully taken hold, caught between the rotting agony of the preceding death metal scene and a new found nobility taking hold amongst the undead. It's a bit of an oversimplification to simply pass this off as Varg's answer to \"A Blaze In The Norther Sky\", but for some reason that's the album that regularly comes up as a good point of reference, despite the obviously different presentation and more imaginative album art.\n",
        "\nThere's a definite mystique to Burzum's music, regardless to whatever era it comes from, something which transcends the ideological and personal quirks of the craftsman, and even his most infamous exploits. The more exposed and simplistic the presentation, the more magical the results tend to be. While most would confess an obvious preference to the 1992-1996 black metal era of Varg's repertoire, many are right to give attention to the 2 odd albums out that came about during his incarceration. \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\" is seen by the majority as being the strong of these two ambient concoctions, mostly for the superior synthesizer that was employed. \n\nHowever, there is perhaps a more subtle reason for exploring this opus first, and it plays into what ultimately makes for a superior ambient album. While both this and its predecessor are possessed of musical ideas well worthy of strenuous repetition, this has a stronger sense of the subtlety that goes into crafting a contemplative musical landscape, one that is much more akin to the restful, dream-like quality that Varg often states as his compositional intent. It is fairly reminiscent of Eastern monastic meditation music, perhaps taking a few hints from the percussive quality of Indonesian Gamelan ensembles and Japanese ambient composers, alongside the remnant of medieval sounds that were pronounced on \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\". But for the less familiar with the Eastern approach to ambiance, a few select instrumentals from \"Drawing Down The Moon\" contained a similarly percussive character.\n\nFrom an accessibility standpoint, this is also a superior effort in that while equally minimalistic as its predecessor, the scope of repetition is much shorter, as are the song lengths. Even when breaking the 6 minute mark, which involves two of the more percussive numbers on here, the flow of things is very organic and smooth. While the album's title refers to the throne of Odin, the musical contents reveal a land that is mysterious, but not quite as grave or forbidding as the vast battlefields, exploits of blood and fire, and punishing winter storms that tend to typify the Norse rendering of mythology. This is the mirror opposite of violence, a sort of quiet tranquility that could perhaps be likened to a lone shaman local to Varg's homeland keeping to his own hermitage and simply contemplating the world around him.\n\nPutting aside all the obvious controversies surrounding the band's name is obviously impossible, but it is often necessary to separate the work from the man, and the works found here are very inviting for anyone who wants to hang up his spiked gauntlets and blood stained war hammer for a while and meditate while at one's personal chambers. This is an album that can, with the right mood being present in the listener, morph the most humble abode into a veritable palace of the ancients within said consumer's mind. Perhaps it's more fitting for a film than a lone studio effort, but whatever functionality is attributed to it, it bridges the gap between sufficiency and efficiency masterfully.\n",
        "\nI find it odd that several prominent (I use the term loosely) metal websites decided to ban coverage of Burzum in response to a recent online rant by Varg Vikernes regarding the shootings and bombing carried out by Norwegian extremist Anders Breivik. Isn\u2019t this ban coming about seventeen years too late? A self-righteous denouncement of Vikernes this point in the game is basically the same as saying \u201cMurder and arson are okay, but hey, we draw the line at hateful remarks!\u201d Of course, I realize that these sites weren\u2019t around back when Vikernes was actually committing crimes, but if they truly found him to be so deplorable, shouldn\u2019t they have banned coverage from the outset based on his actions and not some ineffectual hate-mongering that no one would have paid attention to in the first place had they not drawn attention to it with their sanctimonious grandstanding?\n\nBut I digress. I do not wallow in the cesspool of imagined ethical superiority, and therefore have no problem discussing Varg Vikernes\u2019 music. Contrary to what the metal morality police attempt to shove down our throats, it is entirely possible to separate Burzum from its creator\u2019s dodgy politics/beliefs. With that out of the way, it pleases me to say that Varg Vikernes the musician has solidified his \u201ccomeback\u201d and proven once and for all that his trailblazing brand of black metal is indeed timeless with Fallen, his second album since being released from prison in 2009.\n\nBut what is it that makes Burzum timeless? For me, it\u2019s Vikernes\u2019 guitar playing. His note choices and sense of composition have a hypnotic effect, the very definition of the infamous black metal \u201ctrance-out\u201d, a web of spindly, treble-soaked riffage that\u2019s all too easy to get hopelessly lost in. Whenever I listen to Fallen I think of enormous trees, with gnarled, twisted, tangled roots burrowing deep into the soil; it probably has something to do with the earthy, slightly raw guitar tone Vikernes employs here. It gives the album a naturalistic quality that makes the compositions feel as much like folk music as black metal, but without ever degenerating into the silliness that \u201cfolk metal\u201d typically implies (perhaps more akin to neofolk?). Of course, black metal at its core has always been a form of folk music, and there are few better suited to uphold that tradition than an outlaw/pariah such as Vikernes, who also happens to be one of the genre\u2019s architects (okay, so maybe you can\u2019t separate the man from the music 100%, oh well).\n\nSpeaking of tradition, Fallen was recorded at Grieghallen with production and mixing assistance from Pytten. This studio/producer combination has been responsible for nearly every landmark album in the Norwegian black metal canon (De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, In the Nightside Eclipse, etc) and although only time will tell if Fallen will ever reach the same level of acclaim as those classic recordings, the album does manage to capture a similar vibe without sounding forced or self-consciously retro. This is how black metal is supposed to sound; uninhibited, mesmerizing and totally free from the trappings of modernity.\n\nIn addition to showcasing Vikernes\u2019s six-string mastery and benefitting from a strong production scheme, Fallen also represents Burzum at its most compelling from a compositional perspective. If anything, the album comes off as a refinement of the ideas that Vikernes began to explore on Filosofem; the spellbinding repetition, hazy, quasi-psychedelic atmospheres and unique vocal approach have been honed to a fine point. Whereas Filosofem sounded like a collection of experiments (albeit very successful and interesting ones), Fallen sounds like a collection of songs. In this respect, Fallen brings the more experimental qualities of Filosofem together with the sharp yet expansive songwriting style Vikernes brought to the fore on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Indeed, the more I listen to Fallen, the more I tend to view 2010\u2032s Belus as a \u201cwarm-up\u201d album.\n\nRegardless of what you think of Varg Vikernes the person, it is difficult to deny the significance of Varg Vikernes the musician, especially when he continues to craft such intriguing, vital and relevant work. Fallen just might be the most fully realized Burzum album to date, an elegy for what once was, and a glimmer of hope for the future of the black metal tradition.\n\noriginally written for http://thatshowkidsdie.com\n",
        "\nThe start of Burzum. The infamous Burzum, arguably one of the most influential and infamous black metal bands...and what a way to start.\n\nThis demo is breathtaking. The absolutely horrible sound quality of early 90's Norwegian black metal demos is present and it adds so much to this demo it is unbelievable. At least half of the atmosphere is created by the sound quality because it just feels so dark and destructive and hopeless. I don't understand why people complain about how bad black metal demos' sound quality is because it adds so much to the music.\n\nNow to the music itself. It's pure genius. Varg is a mastermind at creating this type of ambient black metal. His use of minor scales and tempo changes are insane, especially if you take into account how young he was when he released this. Love him or hate him, you cannot help but respect his musical capabilities. The riffs are executed at a very slow pace and somewhat melodically, although they do suffer a bit from buzzing. The drums are also played slowly. There isn't anything special going on in the drums or the bass as well, but that's fine by me because they would ruin the atmosphere of dread that this demo has. Okay, maybe a little bit more bass would have helped, but still. Every track is unique and has breathtaking riffs. This demo is instrumental as you probably already knew, which adds even more to the overall affect.\n\nThis demo creates a great atmosphere and has some ingenious work, however it is far from perfect. The bass and drums are lacking, and even though each song is unique, they do stay at around the same tempo. This demo is still well worthy of the name Burzum. If you see this on Ebay or something, I would definitely get it. It's a piece of black metal history and is awesome music as well.\n",
        "\nAfter a decade in prison, Varg Vikernes\u2019s return to black metal was an extremely anticipated event. Putting aside the absurd amount of social and political hype that surround Varg\u2019s first post-prison album, there was also a ton of musical pressure. Before being imprisoned, Burzum released a pair of masterworks that defined and redefined the genre of black metal; \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d and \u201cFilosofem\u201d. Most of the past decade\u2019s best black metal releases owe a great deal to those albums. Fair or not, Varg was expected to release a similar masterpiece in his first go-round after incarceration. Astonishingly, Varg was up to the challenge, releasing both the heaviest and most diverse album of his career. At the same time, the composition is intricate and the mood is complex, cultivating a dynamic presence that remains throughout the album. \n\n\u201cBelus\u201d packs a punch. Gone are the keyboards, which had always given Burzum\u2019s sound a gentler dimension. However, the increased presence of soft, clean vocals both preserves and transforms Burzum\u2019s softer side. The guitars are big, sharp and heavy. They stand well in the forefront, grasping the listener with forceful moods and emotions. Still, every note of the bass is audible and drums are clear. The vocals\u2014far raspier than on previous recordings\u2014are also easily discernible. The production leaves plenty of open space in which the riffs bounce and echo, making for a full-bodied sound. The result is an album that grabs the listener with the pure force of the sound, and then enraptures them with the interplay of melodies. \n\nAnd boy is this album enrapturing! As the glorious cover art implies, this is an album of contrasts and tensions. There are two central elements at play on \u201cBelus\u201d. First, there is the somber, reverent and reflective spirit, similar to the songs \u201cDet Som Engang En Var\u201d and \u201cEn Ring Til Aa Herske\u201d. Second, there is the dark, attacking spirit, similar to \u201cJesus Dod\u201d and \u201cWar\u201d. The way these sounds come together and split apart over the course of the album is nothing short of brilliant. \n\nFor example, \u201cGlemselens Elv\u201d contrasts two folk melodies\u2014a blistering guitar melody and a groovy, Germanic bass line. The two melodies dance around each other, from time to time coming together in a series of solemn bridges before breaking apart again. The contrast of clean and growled vocals further plays off the dark/ light theme.\n\n\u201cKaimadalthas Nedstigning,\u201d one of the most beautiful Burzum songs to date, plays off the theme in a more direct manner. The verse is sharp, frantic and biting, while the chorus is meditative, delicate and venerable. The precise, militant march of the verse naturally slides into the somber and reverent chorus. The soulful clean vocals and tragic guitar solo make the second half of this song splendorous. \n\nAnother landmark is the closing pair of tracks \u201cMorgenroede\u201d and \u201cTilbakekomst (Konklusjon),\u201d which really feel like a single song. These songs cultivate the same trance inducing mood as the ambient tracks \u201cTomhet\u201d and \u201cRundgang um die Transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t\u201d. However, these tracks do so metallically. The shimmering riffs and pulsating bass entrap the listener amidst webs of repetitive patterns\u2014which through only the slightest bits of variation, build toward profound emotional apexes. Like \u201cTomhet\u201d and \u201cRundgang\u2026,\u201d \u201cMorgenroede\u201d and \u201cTilbakekomst\u201d have a soothing and cleansing effect that stands as the perfect palate cleanser after the emotional intensity that characterizes the rest of the album. \n\nThe profundity and originality of these highlights, along with the brilliantly executed light/ dark theme, make \u201cBelus\u201d a classic. As usual, Varg does not settle for the status quo. While countless copy cats have spent the past decade trying to replicate the sounds of \u201cHvis\u2026\u201d and \u201cFilosofem\u201d, \u201cBelus\u201d shows that Burzum is not stuck in the past. Rather than dampening his artistic impulse, it seems Varg\u2019s time in prison has led him to traverse stunning vistas previously unexplored in black metal. \n\n(Originally written for http://listenwell-nocturnal.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nI must admit I was very disappointed with Belus. I thought that it needed more polish, better production, and some more effort put into it. For almost a year I thought, \"I wonder what Belus would sound like if it was more polished, better produced, etc.\". My answer came in March 2011. Fallen is, to me, is a cross between Filosofem, the better parts of Belus, and Det Som Engang Var, which is a great thing.\n\nThe album opens up with \"Fra Verdenstreet\" (From the World Tree). It is the worst song on the album, providing little more than background noise. It is boring. The same can be said for the outro, \"Til Hel og TIlbake Igjen (To Hell and Back Again)\". I mean, c'mon. These two songs have no emotion attached to them, no atmosphere, and subpar playing for all instruments on these two pieces. These two songs make \"Dauoi Baldrs\" look like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nThat aside, this record improves drastically with \"Jeg Faller (I'm Falling)\", a testament to Varg's sheer songwriting prowess. When listening, a huge smile spread across my face. It was recognizably Burzum, but at the same time different. One of the first things I noticed about the new album is the production. While it is still rough, it is a lot cleaner than \"Belus.\" The guitars were longer a good 90% of the track and the drums and bass were heard clearly. Varg adopted the vocal technique he used in Filosofem, but makes it deeper and with that a lot more threatening. \n\nPerhaps the biggest change on this record than his previous works is real legitimate singing. Varg decided to have about half of his lines be cleanly choral (almost Viking) sounding singing, which reminded me of folk metal band like Korpiklaani. It's not just that there are clean vocals, it's that they are extremely well executed. They are powerful and harmonize well. \n\nAfter the awesomeness that is \"Jeg Faller\" comes \"Valen.\" It starts out with a basic guitar riff, then comes the drums and a very catchy background riff that slowly becomes dominant and a meaty bass track. The verses are sung in a raspy growl while the chorus is sung with clean vocals, but they retain some of the harshness of the growl employed in the verses. The result is really fun to listen to while the steady layering of instruments creates a surreal atmosphere.\n\n\"Vanvidd (Madness)\" is another solid tune, but the raspy vocals don't really work in this song while the clean vocals seem weak. The first two minutes of the song is solid blastbeating which does get tiring, but the guitars and the last five minutes of the song redeem the travesty that is the vocals. The song sounds similar to \"Jesus' D\u00f8d\" and there is an interesting layering of vocals that sound like someone puking, howling, fighting a bear, and having his arms removed from his body slowly while the drums change to a fast groove.\n\n\"Ehnver til Sitt (Each Man to his Own)\" starts off sounding like the first twenty seconds of \"Sweating Bullets\" by Megadeth, but very soon becomes its own song. The harshness of the vocals (both growled and clean) coupled with the melancholy tones of the guitars creates a haunting atmosphere and has evil written all over it.\n\n\"Budstikken (The Message)\" is the best song on the record by far. It starts out with a minute-long intro before diving head first into a rapid tremolo-picked riff with the bass and drums adding meat onto its bones. The vocals compliment the song nicely as the raspy and choral style of vocals mix together nicely. The song changes tempos frequently from the mid-tempo intro to the fast verses and slow choruses. They change effortlessly as well. While the verses are great, the song truly shines during the slower parts. The guitars (note the \"s\") harmonize well as each plays its own melody while borrowing off one another while the twangy bass sets a dark atmosphere. Where the slow sections really stand out are Varg's clean vocals. It sounds like a choir of warlords. I find it hard to believe that it came from just one guy. It's incredible.\n\nThe album overall is a masterpiece, up at the top with legendary black metal albums \"Transylvanian Hunger\", \"De Mysteriis dom Sathanas\", and \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.\" The songs are well structured, the songwriting is phenomenal, and the songs separating tracks are dubbed over so nicely, you would think there are four to six Varg Virkenes playing in the studio at the same time. \n\nThe only beef I have with this record is its shortness. Other than the forgettable intro/outro, there are only FIVE tracks. I came away from this wanting more because what is here is truly great. If Varg continues to expand on this release on his next record, I will support him 1000% as this is an amazing piece of work. \n\n+ great songwriting\n+ varied songs\n+ clean vocals \n+ mix\n- intro/outro\n- too short\n\n85/100\n",
        "\nFirst, let me start off by saying that I love the song Dunkelheit (or Burzum, depending on where you're from). It is very repetitive, but also strangely hypnotic. It's steady drum beat, hypnotizing keyboards, and rasped and clean vocals steadily layered onto each other is mesmerising, and truly an epic work (and I don't use the term loosely).\n\nHowever, the video is total garbage. Seemingly random shots of forests in Norway mixed with runes and wolves. I could do that. I would do it for you right now, but this is text only, so I can't. :(\nThe video is also tremendously boring. All it is is just simple cross fades and blinding shots of sunshine in forests. The video also lacks direction. I know that's what Varg stands against, but the video is seemingly random images.\n\nMaybe I'm not getting it, maybe it's supposed to be some sort of avant-garde masterpiece that I'm not getting. That maybe so, but to me at least, the video is best looking away from the screen.\n",
        "\nWhatever your opinion of Burzum or Varg Varkines may be, there is no denying that Burzum albums never settle for the status quo. In spite of the success and praise each of his pre-prison albums received (not to mention the herds of copy cats), Varg continued to explore new song structures, production techniques and vocalizations, displaying a fearlessness of the new. Varg also gets a nod for being one of the few black metal musicians to consistently accomplish masterworks in and out. Each of his (non-keyboard) albums has achieved a degree of greatness. \u201cFallen,\u201d the 8th full length Burzum album, continues former trend\u2014experimenting with crystal clear production and significant increase in clean vocals. However, the experimentation does not come together in the astounding way previous releases have. While \u201cFallen\u201d contains five good songs (the intro and outro fail to impress), moments of profound inspiration or brilliance are scarce and the overall work fails to reach the heights of its predecessors.\n\nThe primary reason the songs on \u201cFallen\u201d never reach such heights is the production. \u201cFallen\u201d is a victim of the \u201cloudness wars.\u201d The sound is extremely clean and excessively condensed. On the positive side every riff is bright, clear and sharp. The bass and drums are also fully audible. The flip side is that the production has no depth, no room for substance or resonance. Consequently, \u201cFallen\u201d sometimes feels like Burzum without the soul\u2014very good melodies and songwriting, but simply not enough presence. The best example would be \u201cVanvidd\u201d, an aggressive track, which like \u201cBlack Spell of Destruction,\u201d from Burzum's debut, builds toward a crescendo of piercing growls and screams. However, the production takes the edge off the screams. What could have been a spine tingling passage ends up sounding flat. There simply isn\u2019t enough sonic space in the recording to allow the layers of vocals to consume the listener in the way they should. \n\nThe other major change is the heavy presence of clean vocals. The first Burzum song to display prevalent clean vocals was the stunning \u201cKaimadalthas Nedstining\u201d on 2010\u2019s \u201cBelus\u201d. The soft and somber clean vocals posed a powerful counterpoint to biting growls. Obviously Varg was satisfied with the results, using clean vocals on all five metal tracks of \u201cFallen.\u201d While none of the tracks on \u201cFallen\u201d match the compositional eloquence of \u201cKaimadalthas Nedstining\u201d the integration of clean vocals into Burzum is a success. The transitions between clean vocals and growls given \u201cFallen\u201d a dynamic, theatric sensibility. Varg does a very good job selecting appropriate riffs for the clean and growled passages. There are also a number of spoken and whispered passages, which further add to the albums dynamism.\n\nOn the whole the songwriting is solid. There are plenty of good melodies and dramatic shifts, keeping the listener engaged. The highlight is \u201cValen,\u201d which contains beautiful clean passages, a blistering guitar crescendo and layers of rippling tremolo in the background, which give the song depth that the other tracks lack. The low point the obnoxious outro, composed of dull percussion passages and mindless noodling on acoustic guitar. The rest of the songs are good, but not great additions to the Burzum cannon.\n\n\u201cFallen\u201d may turn out to be transition album for Burzum. I certainly see potential in the addition to clean vocals to the Burzum sound and enjoy the mood shifts it adds to the sound. There is plenty left for Varg to explore in this domain. I feel less confident that the new production techniques will consistently work with Burzum\u2019s sound, though \u201cValen\u201d shows that with enough layers, it can work. However, while \u201cFallen\u201d may foreshadow better things to come, in itself it does not stand up to the other Burzum (non-keyboard) albums. \u201cFallen\u201d is a solid release, but ultimately a hill amongst mountains within the Burzum landscape. \n\nOriginally written for http://listenwell-nocturnal.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nI've often said that black metal band members should not attempt to do \"ambient\" or \"neoclassical\" side projects. This album is a shining example of everything that's wrong with black metal band members trying to branch out. The underground black metal scene exists in its own world with its own bizarre rules. In the world of black metal it's possible to achieve fame from throwing together sloppy, poorly written, and poorly recorded albums. Creativity, experimentation, and high production values are often shunned. What these band members don't realize is that these values will not translate well into other musical genres.\n\nEnter: Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\n\nThe first sound heard is a solo violin melody of such unacceptable quality that it makes me shake my head in disbelief even after owning this album over a decade. Remember the old days of the internet when people had Geocities webpages that would force your sound card to play little MIDI songs? That's what this entire album sounds like. So this is it, folks. We're only five seconds into this album and it's clear that it's going to be a loooong journey. \n\nAfter enduring almost nine minutes of repetitive string/saxophone/timpani drivel, I'm about to hit the next track button when track two kicks in. What a breath of fresh air. Track two begins with a quick, beautiful harp melody, topped with that same annoying violin sound from the first track. The melody it self really is quite beautiful and dreamlike, but it quickly wears out its welcome around the 1:00 mark when you realize that it's going to be another repetitive, four note song.\n\nThere's really not much more worth saying about this album. The rest of the tracks are comprised of violin/string/timpani/choir sounds. Pretty much every track establishes its melody by the 0:20 mark and just repeats it to the point of nausea. There are very few redeeming qualities about this album. The whole low-fi, primitive, sort of thing might work within black metal, but this album is a failure for trying to apply those characteristics to classical music.\n",
        "\nThis album is something special to me. It is about as perfect as a black metal album can be, in that distinctive style which Varg pioneered. Other bands have tried but most have failed to match (or even come close to) this album, and most other Burzum works. What makes Hvis so special, then? Well, everything. \n\nFirst, the atmosphere is perfect and consistent. Partly due to the production, party the overall tones used, and partly just the songwriting and riff construction, the atmosphere is immense and immersive. It is open and expansive on Det Som Engang Var and Tomhet, while the atmosphere becomes harsh and oppressive on the title track, and there is a bit of both on Inn I Slottet Fra Dr\u00f8mmen. \n\nSome will claim that the songs here are repetitive or minimalistic. They would be correct, really. However, like Darkthrone after Soulside Journey, that was the point. The ambience of the records helps produce a grim atmosphere, and is all a part of black metal. If one lets oneself be immersed in the atmosphere which Hvis tries to create, it is easy to become entranced, after the lumbering, long introduction of Det Som\u2026 which is exactly what HLTO wants to do. And when that happens, the record hardly seems repetitive. The songs generally work on a few themes, however, they are incredibly well arranged, and there\u2019s just enough variation for it to be interesting throughout and maintain the ambience as the songs ebb and flow. \n\nEvery song is a highlight on this record. Each song is fabulously composed, and actually, Varg is a hell of a musician. The drums sound strong and punchy, the guitars crisp, and the bass can even be heard. His vocals, usually a love \u2018em or hate \u2018em thing, are on top form here. They fit well, and that is what matters to me. They are harsh and distinctive, an unmistakable rasping shriek which DSBM acts would later try to use, with varying degrees of success. \n\nAgain, every song is a highlight. It\u2019s only four tracks, but all of them are masterful. A few highlights throughout the run-time for me, however, would include the ending riff of Det Som Engang Var, and the entire outro of Inn I Slottet Fra Drommen. However, this is not a record which is meant to be split in pieces; it is meant to be heard as a whole, in one sitting, with one\u2019s whole attention paid to it. Regardless, an amazing album from Varg. Without doubt a landmark album of both black metal and metal itself.\n",
        "\nOnly a year after releasing Belus, Varg returns to release his second album after being released from prison. This album does not deviate too far from the Burzum formula but there are many experimental moments that pay off. Although many people know of Burzum only because of Varg's connections with murder and church burning, he proves once again that he has artistic merit and that Burzum is much deeper than mere shock value.\n\nMuch like Belus, Fallen starts with a short experimental intro. This one is very ambient and features eerie whispers and deep rumbling. It conjures up haunting images of gargoyles overlooking a dark cathedral. As the black metal comes into play, the first thing that is apparent is the production. Varg has said that this album has been produced in the same way as classical music. It is hard to know if this is true or not, but the new approach to recording has certainly paid off. The guitar is dense and heavily distorted, yet still easy to make out. There is very clear production on the drums, which are simple but highly effective. Many metal bands drown their songs in relentless and monotonous blast beats, but this is not the case with Fallen. The bass plays a very important role in the atmosphere of this album. There is one point in \"Jeg Feller\" where all the instruments but the bass drop out and Varg half speaks and half whispers in a very creepy way. It is experimentation like this that makes the album so interesting. It would be a good idea to listen to this album on high quality headphones, as there are subtle elements that are crucial to the album, such as the bass lines, that might not be audible on cheap earbuds.\n\nThere is not a bad song to be found on Fallen. \"Jeg Feller\" showcases Varg's surprisingly melodic clean vocals. Varg's clean vocals have gotten very good on this release. His rasps are powerful, without being over the top. The riff on \"Valen\" is one of Burzum's best riffs. It is simple, repetitive and highly effective. In fact, much of the album is like this. It is in no way complicated, but the repetition is hypnotic rather than tedious. \"Enhver til sitt\" features slow melodic sections that are almost reminiscent of doom metal. Like most black metal albums, there is no shortage of tremolo riffs. \"Til Hel og tilbake igjen\" is a very interesting outro. There is a slow hypnotic drum playing for most of the track. The instrumentation has a vaguely Eastern vibe to it. Varg's willingness to try new things has payed off on this album. This album has an old-world European feel to it. When compared to much of the stale black metal that seems to be spreading like a plague, this is very authentic sounding and a breath of fresh air.\n\nWhile many people accuse Burzum of playing boring, typical black metal, that is not very fair or accurate. Its not Varg's fault that so many mediocre bands have ripped off his sound. That said, it is true that there have been bands that have successfully added to Burzum's style and incorporated new influences. Without Burzum, black metal as we know it would not exist. With Fallen, Varg shows no signs of slowing down. This is a very welcome addition to Burzum's discography. With so many black metal bands happy with playing mediocre music, Varg deviates from the trend, continuing to write original and interesting music.\n",
        "\nWith \"Fallen\", the second Burzum album recorded and released since he left jail, Varg Vikernes signals he's not just back in the business of churning out melodic folk-tinged black metal but is seriously carving out his particular minimalist niche within it. Apart from the two instrumental tracks that open and close the album, \"Fallen\" sounds like a continuation of the melodic first half of the previous comeback \"Belus\" album which itself was a continuation of the \"Filosofem\" album, way back in 1996: the songs usually have simple structures based on repeating guitar riff loops laid over equally repetive percussion loops, topped with lyrics that are sung, chanted, spoken or whispered. At least Vikernes has retained a knack for creating distinctive and catchy melodies that capture and hold a variety of moods, often in the same song: melancholy, anger, despair and utter hopelessness can follow each other in the same song just through the repetition of one riff over and over, with only changes in vocal style from grim-voiced aggression to clean-toned indifference indicating any direction and tension build-up; this knack is the music's saving grace.\n\nThe album relies heavily on Vikernes's vocals and lyrics for variety, direction and unity. The vocal work is good but not varied with the singing bouncing between a lead vocal of grim throaty hoarseness and a chorus of clean singing that usually lacks emotion. A case could be put forward for having synthesised voice choirs or an additional singer on this album and future Burzum albums if Vikernes persists in his particular musical style and direction. Not knowing any Norwegian - I remain grimly monolingual in spite of having reviewed music from nearly every corner of the planet - I can only guess from the CD booklet illustrations and some words that the lyrics deal with a personal descent into darkness of some kind. If taken literally, the illustrations suggest the descent of Odin from Asgard to Earth and Hel. (When I first wrote this review, I was unaware that the album actually deals with descent into madness.) Overall the songs are quite good and consistent in their playing and emotional expressiveness, and technically they may be more complex than they might appear to non-musicians like myself, but with the exception of \"Vanvidd\" which features an episode of screaming and werewolf howling, the songs individually are not very outstanding and could be considered as parts of one work.\n\nThe real gem on this album is the outro track \"Til Hel og tilbake igjen\": it's completely left-field in its amateurish, neo-primitive, almost shamanic nature, just a drum thumped rhythmically by hand and a stringed instrument that sounds like a wire strung between two tin can being strummed or plucked while a ghost mouths barely audible whispers. The whole set-up sounds like a half-hearted after-thought to the rest of the album and in the context of the album's theme, that most likely is the intention. I'm surprised the last track isn't more chaotic than it is, it actually sounds quite orderly and well-mannered, but I shouldn't presume that if a mind has descended completely into madness that it should be full of \"noise\" and \"chaos\" in the way such concepts are conventionally interpreted in music. A mad mind can still generate \"order\", just not in the way we understand \"order\". The track is proof that Vikernes, if he wants to, can pull out something original and still be a force to be reckoned with. \n\nNot a great Burzum release but there is potential there for Vikernes to grow into a more folk-oriented and refined melodic style of music and away from black metal pop.\n",
        "\nFinally is it here! The long awaited return of Burzum. The old Burzum records were a brilliant mix of cold, screaming vocals and raw, haunting guitar riffs. Before he started his synth-crap he released three fantastic albums. It seems like this is still a big part of him because Belus reminds me much more about the earlier releases than traditional progression should suggest. This is probably both natural and understandable because of his incarceration, but still a pleasant surprise.\n\nVarg Vikernes has returned to the more guitar-based black metal. On Belus we find both aggressive thrash metal riffing and atmospheric, monotonous passages. Long songs that really sucks you in and creates an amazing atmosphere. Simple, but yet so brilliant. Just the way we like Burzum. The songs are well-written and dynamic, and also contains some spoken lyrics and clean vocals, which I think works great on this album. The bass is louder in the mix than before and the vocals are no longer the depressive black metal vocals that Varg is known for. Instead he uses more standard black metal vocals, which I think is a change for the better.\n\nIt`s not much to say about the production. As all the previous non-ambient Burzum albums Belus was recorded in Grieghallen in his hometown Bergen with the legendary Pytten. It doesn\u2019t sound like the most expensive production, but that has never really been a subject when it comes to Burzum. On Belus we find a primitive, naked sound landscape and I think it works great without taking away too much of the overall atmosphere. The production is way better than any of the previous Burzum albums, but is still able to maintain the Burzum sound. \n\nThe songs are overall strong, and even though this is without a doubt the most anticipated album since the birth of black metal, it does not disappoint. I am rather surprised that he can deliver an album like this after all these years. Belus grows with each listening and just keeps getting better and better in my opinion. Burzum is definitely back!\n",
        "\nBurzum's at it again. When Burzum's newest release, Fallen, came in the mail, I checked the inner artwork and found something saying that this album was completed in recording November 2010. That means that this album was fully recorded 4 months before Belus (the previous album) was even released. So yeah, Varg's doing it again. Recording things at a pedal-to-the-metal speed, blasting out music and releasing it periodically over the years. (Before his jail sentence he recorded 4 albums and an EP in 18 months). \n\nAnyway, when I heard Fallen was coming, I wasn't sure it was real. The Times New Roman font on the front, the English album title, the fact that it was released with almost no mention anywhere (magazines, forums, etc)... it all seemed highly suspicious. But nope, Fallen is totally real... and now I own one of the limited vinyl copies. Yay. \n\nSo, Fallen picks up where Belus left off: tinny, yet glossy production, technical guitars, casually sung melodic vocals... but being that Burzum never makes the same album twice, drastic changes are present. \n\nLet's start by talking about the tone. Unlike the Warm, sleepy, fuzzy feeling of Belus, this one goes for a much more bombastic approach that we caught a glimpse of in songs like Keliohesten on Belus. It's heavier and more in your face, but it doesn't totally abandon soft winding sections. There's a lot more moments that are pounding and heavy, moments that make you bang your head. In this way, the album does bear similarity to Burzum's '92 debut. There's also a lot of melody this time around. I'd say that this may well be Burzum's most melodic album yet. There're tons of melodic passages and riffs on songs like Valen and Budstikken, but at no point does it feel wishy-washy or watered down. Yup, the Burzum spirit is still alive and well here. I do have a gripe though. This comes from the production. The guitars are distorted as you'd expect, and they sound thin and tinny, which is okay, but I feel that and the rest of the production sort of confines and restricts the atmosphere's full potential. I found that there was a grandeur tone in the drums and guitars in earlier Burzum albums like Hvis Lyset Tar Oss where the atmosphere seemed to expand before you into an epic soundscape that seemed to have a life of its own. I wish Varg had tried that here, because I think that it would have fit nicely. Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere isn't totally impeded, but I think it has dwindled. I would like to hear a different production than on Belus. But anyway, let's talk about what atmosphere there is. \n\nThe album also has a primitive feeling, though it isn't a bad way. It's sort of a tribal feeling, and although it serves as a small underline for most of the time, it becomes highly prevalent in the outro of the album, Til Hel og Tilbake Igjen. The album doesn't haven that wide-open foresty/mountain range feeling that prior albums had. Instead, it seems to be more confined, like the album's taking place inside a room where rituals are performed (like I said, the album sounds quite tribal). I think most of this comes from the sound of the drums. While they're low in production, they do have a resonance to them that seems like something new. Also, the riffs have this sort of native flair of renaissance (as much of that as there could be from electric guitar, mind you). The other thing that adds to the tribal tone would be the vocals. \n\nVarg's used melodic vocals in the past, but never this much. I know this bothers a ton of 'tr00' Burzum fans, but I really find it interesting, and it brings a lot of progression to the table, which is something I highly value in any band. Unlike on Belus though, the soft vocals are utilized much more tastefully, and are no longer sung casually. There seems to be a flair of style growing in Varg's clean voice, and I like it. It really fits with the melodiousness of the album. And then you have your harsh vocals. Unfortunately, Varg once shies away from using the harsh wails that made him so distinguishable in his first 3 albums. I'll repeat what I said in my Belus review: he probably either thought those vocals would be too much for the tone of the album to handle without sounding akWard, or he's getting too old. If it's the former, I think a wail or two would work at various parts of the album. He does do something in the middle of Vanvidd that someone resembles these vocals, but he never quite touches back on them completely. Instead of using those wails though, he does what he was doing in Belus: a hoarse growl similar to Darkthrone. He's been going for this style since Filosofem, and while I found it a little weak or even boring in Belus, I think he's getting the hang of it. There's a lot more power in those growls now, and I'm starting to recognize them as 'Varg's growl's', whereas before they seemed a little unoriginal. \n\nThe album varies itself with a good amount of interludes that utilize instrumental layering; there are lone guitar moments, lone drum moments, lone bass moments.... and the way the music all comes together is very satisfying. There's plenty of diffrence with the feelings of songs (Enhver til Sitt, Budstikken, and Jeg Faller all have a different emotional tone), but I'm happy to say that there are no out of place tracks on this release, like War on Burzum's debut or Sverddans on Belus. All the songs here fit the album well. While this album still does suffer from the problem Belus had with repitition on a couple songs, it isn't quite as blatant or tiring, nor does it last as long. There are moments where I feel like the song is dragging into the dirt a bit (Vanvidd didn't hold my attention all the way through), but it isn't as evident as it was on Belus and the album never becomes irritating.\n\nI'd say that Varg Vikernes is defenitely in the process of transitioning out of black metal. The grooving riffs and soft sung vocals are highly remeniscent of viking and folk metal. The black metal is still there in that there are plently of tremolo-picked riffs that cut and slice, plenty of Darkthrone-esque growling, and a sparse tone. I think that this progression for the moment may be slightly clunky, but it isn't akward. Fallen gave me the sense of Varg trying t ovind another groove for himself to dwell in for a while.\n\nThe intro and outro both work well in the album's favour, deepening the atmosphere and hightening aticipation/bringing you back down to earth. While keyboards are still nowhere to be seen (or should I say, heard), Varg makes up for it with a highly unorthodox ambient outro, done with drums, acoustic guitar, and an old renaissance string instrument (I can't recall the name of it) that gives the end of the album a nice wide-open vibe. It starts creepy and otherworldy, but it eventually segways into a soft relaxing outro on another string instrument that sounds like it might be a short excerpt from one of the songs on Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf. Really nice outro. \n\nSo for the most part, I'm quite impressed with this. I haven't had enough time to let it fully grow on me, so I can't saw right now whether or not this is better than Belus, but It's defenitely good. Varg still hasn't ran out of ideas as far as I'm concerned, despite the similar production tone to Belus. Burzum has stayed on my favorite band's list after I heard this album, because Varg's shown us that he can still take his new music to new places and show us new things. More original than Belus was, more action-packed than Belus was... the only thing that doesn't come through as clearly is the atmosphere. I recommend this to Burzum fans, especially those who were turned off by Belus. This may just bring them racing back to Burzum's music. It still doesn't hold a candle to the original four Burzum black metal albums, but in my mind those are all untouchable masterpieces. The point is that this album satisfies. Give it a spin. \n\nOut of the whole album, I definitely recommend the song Budstikken. This song showcases pretty much all of the album's elements and has a lot of great action-packed riffs and beats. A song to bang your head to, like My Journey to the Stars, but also a winding epic track, like Jesu Dod. If you want one song off the album to get an idea for what's here, go for Budstikken.\n\nOriginally posted on http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/\n",
        "\nNormally I'd engage in some sort of preamble for an album as hyped up and important as Belus, but instead I'll dispense with all the cliche formalities and (unrelated) historical notes and discuss why I found it to be an inconsistent, often frustrating experience with a few gem like nodes gleaming from its barren fields. You see, back in the early through mid 90s, Vikernes' brand of minimalist black metal with forays into ambiance was a novel concept that he and few others were exploring, and with each new record he released, he adopted subtle means of reinvention that articulated a high level of distinction among the masses of extremity obsessed blast mavens and Gothic freaks who were using it to climb new commercial heights. It was refreshing, and inspired countless followers.\n\nBelus does not entirely dispose of such a strategy, but it is rarely compelling in its delivery. The content could be placed somewhere between Filosofem and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss in overall tone, but it lacks in the razor spun atmosphere of the former, or the hypnotic balance of the latter. Once again, Burzum journeys to the well of repetitive, primitive black metal to create a lulling, dark and obscure window into European myth-history, but it feels somehow drier than his past full-lengths. Granted, I was actually pretty happy that he returned to his metallic roots post incarceration, but by this point in time the aesthetics of his 90s work have been beaten to death. Very often this has been the work of monotonous pretenders who embark on their sonic journey with nothing more than a handful of derivative guitar riffs, rasped voice and drum machine, but occasionally the execution has come close to classic Burzum standards of curious antiquity, and I dare say even surpassing them. In short, Belus is not a dishonest effort, but it sounds too humble, too dialed in, almost a follower of itself.\n\nIt doesn't help that the album starts off so poorly, with its stark, brief introduction \"Leukes Renkespill (The Intrigues of Leuke\") which sounds like nothing more than a bottle cap being snapped or rolled about for 30 seconds before the immensely generic \"Belus' D\u00f8d (The Death of Belus)\". Varg's fascination with the multi-named European deity life-death-rebirth entity is enduring here (we've already had a 'Death of Baldr', Norse deity associated with the same portfolio of principles), but the music itself is incredibly vapid of memorable notation, its central riff losing all its haunting luster after a mere 20-30 seconds, all too typical of just about anything snagged at random from the 90s pantheon of Norse or Swedish bands. Don't get me wrong, it's the primitive black metal many were praying for, but I found it wholly ineffectual.\n\n\"Glemselens Elv (The River of Forgetfulness)\" is every bit as repetitive. Considering that it's 12 minutes in length, it had the potential for disaster, but at least for a few minutes it had me lost in its waters, especially the duet of clean and rasped vocals (which Vikernes' will use to greater effect on the next album, Fallen). His heavier vocals are pretty null and indistinct throughout this album, but with the added singing it creates a stronger, ebbing depression in tune with the backing guitar. Unfortunately, 11:35 is just too much of this, and despite a few minor, majestic transitions, its too much of a broken record for even Varg. Then we come upon \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning (The Descent of Kaimadalthas)\", a stronger experience with a nice counter chord thrown against the blast riff, and the clean vocal refrain which creates an unusual, percussive calm to the surging environment about it. In my opinion, its probably the best track on the album, but again the central guitar is treacherously dull of its own accord.\n\n\"Sverddans (Sword Dance)\" is true to its title, a sort of black/thrashing speed metal riff being wound through two patterns before a lead melody, but it disappears almost as quickly as it arrives, and does not leave much of an appropriate stab or slash behind it. \"Keliohesten (The Horse of Kelio)\" and \"Morgenr\u00f8de (Dawn)\" both have their moments; the former's in the way the roiling charge is offset by the backing guitar melody, the latter for the pomp and swell of the bass in the into and the return to the cleaner, narrative vocals. If the entire album had been at least as interesting as these, then I'd have more cause for concern over it, but then, I wouldn't consider either to number among his better tracks. The conclusion is a 9+ minute instrumental \"Belus' Tilbakekomst (The Return of Belus)\", not at all the first of such guitar driven pieces to emanate from the gray matter of Varg, but despite some shining heights, it wears out its welcome about as quickly as a Nadja record. Decent background thriving, nothing more.\n\nBelus is not a great record, nor even a good one, because in over 50 minutes of content, there are about 15-20 that are mesmerizing enough to listen through repeatedly, and no singular track is ultimately that convincing when compared to his past material. At the same time, it's not a bad listen, just average. I can understand and forgive a few flakes of rust on the creative joints, seeing that he spent such a long time without access to musical instruments, and at least he'd written something more substantial than Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, which showed only the vaguest hints of effort. But even the cover to this is all too soon forgotten. Thankfully, it would not take Burzum very long to recover, because Fallen channels a number of the ideas here into an appealing, logical succession.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nHli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, named for the all seeing throne of Odin, is the sixth Burzum full-length, the second written and recorded during Varg Vikernes's incarceration. Like it's predecessor, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, it was written purely as an ambient/neo-classical work, with no black metal involved. This time, however, a keyboard was acquired for the recording, so the tones sound a little richer perhaps than the MIDI used previously. The problem is that the heightened production quality this creates is counteracted here by the drab minimalism used in these compositions. Burzum is no stranger to the aesthetic, and in the past, has triumphed with the strategy, but where Dau\u00f0i Baldrs possessed some sweeping, rousing architecture that stood tall in the memory, there are very few moments here that create that same effect.\n\nThis is ultimately less Medieval in structure, and has more of a New Age vibe about it. The sparse nature of the compositions remind me of the Japanese artist Kitaro, though not as skilled at the spaces in between the subtle melodies. Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf is almost pure mood, with few if any dominant strings of notes being assembled through its conjuration. There are exceptions to this rule, like \"Der Tod Wuotans (The Death of Wotan)\", or the brief passages of \"Der weinende Hadnur (The Weeping Hadnur)\" and \"Die Liebe Ner\u00feus (The Love of Nerthus)\" where spritely melody is evoked, but sadly even these come off as rather bland in the long run. I felt the more powerful pieces were \"Tuistos Herz (Tuisto's Heart)\", which involves sheer New Age nuance with shimmering synthesizers and thrumming atmosphere, and the dour and incredibly sparse \"Einf\u00fchlungsverm\u00f6gen (The Power of Empathy)\", with a very faint hint of windchime-like noise behind the deeper chime percussion and solemn keys.\n\nThough I had previously juggled this and the post-hiatus, 2010 album Belus back and forth as to which was my least favorite of Burzum's full-length albums, it is Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf which inevitably comes up with the shortest straw. Certainly this is not a bad background piece if you're caught in contemplation or desire something tranquil for nature or navel gazing, and several gleaming moments are caught within the amber, but the ideas do not feel as well formed as anything the Norseman had previously recorded, and it feels almost interchangeable with a large host of New Age and minimalist ambient projects I've heard. It's the most peaceful thing Vikernes has ever written, and the biggest contrast to his black metal works, so it's surprising in that regard, but it doesn't paint in truly compelling shades. I realize many loathe Dau\u00f0i Baldrs due to its crude and cheesy MIDI polish, but at least that album had an ominous zeal about it that I enjoy, and in truth most of those tracks have never abandoned my memory. I enjoy the packaging, concept and the written narrative here (much like the last two works), but I am rarely if ever struck with the desire to listen to it.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nDau\u00f0i Baldrs ('Death of Balder') is yet another anomaly in the long string of anomalies that have festooned the career of Varg Vikernes. Recorded entirely during his prison sentence, and without the benefit of musical instruments, it certainly had its work cut out for it, and yet, fascinatingly, it succeeds despite this. Was it too costly a risk to take? We can each answer this only for ourselves. I personally know several people who despise this recording with a passion, thinking it some blasphemy upon the damnable Earth, or a mere grab at cash during his incarceration, sold upon the name Burzum alone. But certainly, anyone who sits through the entire 40 minutes can hear that there is in fact a stout effort placed into its haunting drought. All atmospherics. Somnolent compositions of a folk saga being played out as puppets on a dimly lit stage.\n\nThis is a MIDI album. Not a metal album. It's got more in common with cryptic Super Nintendo role playing games than Hvis Lyset Tar Oss or Det Som Engang Var, as if Tchaikovsky had penned some lost Final Fantasy score. Yet, the aesthetic choices made through the compositions are theatrical, ritual and maintain a persistent gravitas. Part of this is the packaging, which is, like Filosofem, brilliantly conceived. In fact, it's the best looking Burzum CD period, including artwork by Tanya Stene; the lyrics and poetry incorporated to guide the listener through the imagery being evoked in the music, despite the lack of vocals on the album. I might have liked having English translations in the booklet, but they are provided on the official website for any who want to read them. Certainly for something this minimalist, Varg and the label have gone all out. There was no stopping his vision, confinement or not.\n\nMusically, the material ranges from a martial, Medieval framework to a more lush, melodic folk landscape, all of which captivate the desperation of Balder's saga. The quality is a bit lopsided, and I can say I enjoy four of the songs greatly and the other two not so much. \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" itself is the opener, and the nearly 9 minutes portray an ominous descent, a conflagration of dour dreamstuff that is carried through a number of melodic, eerie lines and a rather stout contrast in the percussive use of the horn. \"Hermo\u00f0r \u00c1 Helfer\u00f0 (Hermodr on a Journey to Hel)\" is far shorter, clocking in under 3 minutes, and features a flighty repetition of pianos with a flute-like narrative. \"B\u00e1lfer\u00f0 Baldrs (Balder's Burning)\" returns to the vibes of the first track, only it runs dry within the first few minutes, and it's not a favorite here.\n\n\"I Heimr Heliar (In Hel's Home)\" is steady and bombastic, like a march, but all too brief, and then the album curves into the dire eaves of \"Illa Ti\u00f0andi (Ill Tidings)\", which is incredibly drawn out to over 10 minutes, ultimately a bit too repetitive even for a man who on his prior album included a 25 minute ambient track. \"M\u00f3ti Ragnarokum (Towards Ragnarok)\", on the other hand, is beautiful, perhaps my favorite tune on the whole disc, with a powerful sense of melancholy evoked through the piano and the sweeping symphonic discourse, then the stalking violin string segues that morph into pianos and back again to the creepy melodies. When I say it feels very Metroid, I mean no insult whatsoever. There are likely only a handful of folks who will understand what I'm getting at, but this piece creates a similar, isolated vibe to that game's old score, which I worship.\n\nIn the end, this is an enjoyable departure, an enduring experiment, but it does suffer a few flaws. For one, this is the one of the only cases where some of the repetition that has proven crucial to Vikernes' compositions in the past creeps out and bites the album on the ass. It's hardly crippling, but at least two of the central tracks (\"B\u00e1lfer\u00f0 Baldrs\" and \"Illa Ti\u00f0andi\") needed something more to them to round out their considerable, 16 minute chunk of the ritual. Also, this is intensely crude, even for MIDI, it was basically shunted over to a tape recorder. The format is pretty damn charming, but I'd honestly love to hear a few of these pieces worked out with an actual orchestra. That said, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs is what it is, a musician's perseverance through a near depletion of any and all musical resources. One can envision its creator coming up with these bits in confinement, how much more haunting they must have felt within the folds of that imagination. I wouldn't mind hearing more in this style, but that doesn't seem likely.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nIt's interesting to me that Varg Vikernes has been quoted as stating the Filosofem album is not his favorite, but then it wouldn't be the first time I've disagreed with a creator about his/her work. What's also curious is the fact that, like most Burzum albums, the material here was recorded several years earlier than the actual release. The reason it's so fascinating is that each of his full-lengths have been markedly different, so to track them over such a smaller span of time shows either blind coincidence or strong foresight before his imprisonment. Not all of the tracks here were meant for Filosofem. \"Burzum\" aka \"Dunkelheit\", was an old track originally intended for inclusion with the previous album Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, but wound up here. Regardless, they all incredibly well together into what I consider Varg's most compelling, nightmarish work.\n\nBefore getting to the music itself, though, I'd like to point out how beautiful the packaging for this CD is. Up to this point, Burzum albums had more or less been represented by dire, black and white images which effectively mirrored their grisly content. But Filosofem sees not only a mild injection of color, but also creates a powerful rustic cohesion, composed of artwork by Theodor Severin Kittelsen. Now, having admittedly little knowledge of Norse painters and illustrators, I might have found this more aesthetically pleasing than those who were accustomed to the style of imagery, but either way, it was pretty impressive for a black metal album in 1996. The lyrics here are half Norse, half English, and the explanations are in Norse. This is a rare case where the German track list is as prominent as the 'official', Norwegian titles, most notably \"Burzum\", which many to this day prefer to call by the German translation \"Dunkelheit\". Pretty unusual, especially since it didn't seem to be the case for the other albums.\n\nAs for the overall production values, Filosofem must seem a step down from the decidedly clean power of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. The guitars are ruddy and distorted enough that they pierce the listeners' arteries, the drum mix a murky thunder, the synthesizers quaint and the vocals more grueling, spiteful and distorted than any of the prior albums. But oddly enough, this is one of the reasons the album is so damned good, despite Vikernes' own attempts to sabotage it with cheap microphones, fuzz pedal, and whatnot. As I've been revisiting and reviewing the whole Burzum catalog, I've probably made a number of mentions of just how influential these records were and remain. Well, I think it's safe to say that as far as the sound itself, Filosofem must have been the most inspirational of the lot; I've heard more underground black metal records that I could ever think about counting in the past 15+ years, and the structure here is incredibly common among the younger bands. It's probably just as often a subconscious tribute as an open libation, but also because such primitive tones are simple to achieve.\n\nIn particular, a lot of the depressive black metal bands you'll today take their queues from tracks like \"Burzum\", and it's not a strain to reason why. Incredibly crude, pathological chords woven slowly along the steady, solemn drums, conjoined to the plump, minimal glitter of the synthesizers and the repressed vocals, repeated and repeated with only slight deviations to the formula arriving in clean, downtrodden vocals and tweaks to the keys and guitars. \"Jesu D\u00f8d\" moves at a more slicing pace, the opening, bloody melody affixed to feedback before the transition to chords, and then swerving around 1 minute to one of my absolute favorite Burzum riffs in history; like a wall of sanity and comfort dissolved into sheer menace. \"Beholding the Daughters of the Firmament\" follows a similar course to \"Burzum\", but even more repetitious and desolate. It is the two halves of \"Decrepitude\", however, that win the award for the most barren and bitter pieces Vikernes has ever included on an album. Jarring distortion, acidic vocals that sound like a crazed, stray cat's final testimonials before freezing to death, unable to find scraps of food anywhere in the winter. And no percussion! Just waves of death ebbing at you like Merzbow manning a suicide hotline.\n\nThen, of course, there is the ambient piece, \"Rundtg\u00e5ing Av Den Transcendentale Egenhetens St\u00f8tte (Tour Around The Transcendental Columns Of Singularity)\", a monster at over 25 minutes in length. This has long been a divisive element to Filosofem: some love it, some just don't understand it, and some understand it and fucking hate it. I fall firmly into that first batch, and of course anyone familiar with \"Tomhet\" from Hvis Lyset Tar Oss would not be surprised by its inclusion. Perhaps just the breadth. It's an amazingly repetitive but hypnotic synth journey which takes the listener on a tour through spaces external and internal, with scintillating, sparse and shattered melodies offset in thudding, implied bass lines and more of the ringing, fat synth used in other songs like \"Burzum\". If you're huge into 80s horror soundtracks (John Carpenter), Tangerine Dream, or others who once proudly boasted the day's hardly cutting edge pads, then there's no reason you can't be hypnotized here. Does it stick out like a sore thumb? Yes and no. The duration is a challenge, but the synth tones are not outlandish among those used in the metal cuts.\n\nThe cohabitation of the folksy art aesthetic and the almost mocking, drab raze of the composition were both impressive and unique, and there is no other Burzum album I would turn towards for a guaranteed audio mecca into agony. This is the tops for me, just narrowly edging out its predecessor. Once again, in a short framework, Vikernes offered something fascinating that you were unable to discover elsewhere, and Filosofem stands at the nexus of being not only his final black metal recording for over a decade, but also the last that was recorded before he would begin to serve out the murder sentence. It's breathtaking, but not the breathtaking of sunny vistas and dandelions; the breathtaking of having a knife stabbed inside you and turned about, the death of a culture and a history draining through your wounds. Let it be a poignant and ghastly reminder.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMuch like I've narrowed down the nexus of superior thrash metal to largely dwell within the realm of 1986-88, it really felt like black metal's time had come in 1994. Granted, since that time, there has never been a shortage of the stuff, and quite a lot of it supreme, but as for the second wave, 1994 was the spot. Many of my favorite albums of the genre arrived this year, and yes, most of them were Norwegian. Emperor cornered the market on symphonic black early with their brilliant In the Nightside Eclipse. Darkthrone put out the one-track minded, anomalously awesome Transilvanian Hunger. Enslaved and Satyricon each released a pair of cult faves. Mayhem finally arrived in full-length form. Bands like Gorgoroth, Ancient, Hades, Forgotten Woods and Gehenna were also making their debuts, and the scene was expanding in bounds of impressive expression.\n\nThen, of course, there was Hvis Lyset Tar Oss ('If the Light Takes Us'), Burzum's third album, which served as an antithesis to everything I just listed. While many Norse bands were off exploring the heights of savagery and complexity, Varg Vikernes was concentrating inward, to an even more minimal approach than he had taken on the past works. This is not a short album, necessarily, being around 45 minutes in length, but it focuses in on but four lengthy tracks, two of which eclipse the 14 minute mark, and yet, they never quite succumb to the dull pallor such ambition usually wrests from the author. Gone are the shorter, curving compositions found on Det Som Engang Var. Each individual in this quartet is drawn out to painstaking lengths, fully saturating the witness to worlds of obscurity and antiquity. In today's climate, this is not such an uncommon practice. Unless you're living out in the sticks, you probably couldn't stroll four blocks without encountering a handful of bedroom/desktop black or post-black metal artists who drone their swollen dreams on for far too long, offering next to nothing in the interior.\n\nBack in 1994, it was still pretty unusual to run across such a work. It would have been an act of commercial suicide outside of genres like this one, which were already suicide to begin with. But Varg Vikernes has never been one to dwell on such folly, and so Hvis Lyset Tar Oss stood as his least accessible, but most impressive display of carnage to its day. Thematically, the riffs here are a blend of what we experienced on Burzum and Det Som Engang Var. They're not as dark or groove-thick as several of the tracks on the sophomore, but they bring back some of the piercing cold environment of Burzum. During several segments of this album, I felt like I was actually experienced a spiritual successor to Bathory's Blood Fire Death. Not in the savage semblance of its Viking motif, but just the way the guitars are channeled through a raw, repetitive glory that feels like a people, a nation, or a glacier moving slowly towards some conquest that was once unattainable. A forward motion, if you will, that never ceases through the metallic components of this CD, a wave that escalates until finally breaking at about 30 minutes into the track list.\n\nIt begins with a soothing calm. Scintillating keyboard lines with a flute-like tone are measured off against ringing, emotionally charged chords. This is \"Det Som En Gang Var\". The fact that did not appear on the album of the same name creates a startling continuity. Around 3:00, you hear the war drums erupt and a Bathory like procession of vision, not unlike \"A Fine Day To Die\", but steadier and longer. There is little else to occur here for minutes, just a repeating of the drum fills, the sauntering in and out of the synthesizer, and at last, 5 minutes deep, the tortured tones of Vikernes' vocals arrive like a strangulated hag. Rinse, repeat until about 8 minutes where an arching guitar melody arrives to mimic the keyboard, with a deviating tail that feels like a blood caked knife being dragged across the solid ice of a forgotten pond in which someone drowned, their preserved corpse staring through the glass miasma at the returned murderer. In its waking moments, the rhythm and ambiance shifts to an even slower pace, and then in closure a final variation on the central guitar riff arrives to carry it out to oblivion.\n\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" itself follows, increasing the pace of the album to a blast, perhaps the most intense and level blast Burzum had yet managed, the drums kept very low in the mix so the minimal variation in the guitar can create a fuzzed out clarity alongside another of the beautiful but effortless synth lines. The vocals here sound even more forceful than the first track, as if the strangling victim had freed itself, to mock and chastise a gathering of onlookers, to curse them for their passive fascination for its own suffering. Slight shifts are carved into this mountain of atrocity beyond the 2 minute mark, minimal but effective guitar lines that maintain the hypnosis Vikernes is striving for, and then around 6 minutes there is a final, desperate rush, before the torch is passed over to \"Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen (Into the Castle from the Dream)\" and its deceptively jarring monotony. Through this track, Varg weaves Voivod-like dissonance and a gleaming, methodic force until a graceful breakdown half-way in, guitars taking all the weight here until the drums return around 5:30 and slowly gather speed until the lamenting melody of its final act.\n\nLastly, there is \"Tomhet (Emptiness)\", which was wisely placed so as not to erupt the rest of the ritual. With good reason: this is not a metal song. No, this is more akin to something Tangerine Dream would have written during their peak of 80s soundtracks and studio albums, a highly saturated, dreaming atmosphere conjured through three primary synth lines. One of them is mere resonance, surviving for several minutes, while the second repeats a vague, spacelike pattern, and the third crowns it all with benevolent, but cold bliss. Before the 7 minute period, these fade into a more somber tone, as if submerged in an arctic sea, the plump and plucky little melodies of the depths queued by the diver's exposure to the wildlife found therein, calm and strewn towards its destiny of predator and prey. Later, around 10 minutes, flute-like sounds and tinny, recessed percussion arrive that seem to leech the listener from that depth and create a glade-like incandescence, as if the diver had drowned and was seeing some arboreal Elysium. It's quite strange, but it's also my favorite track on this album...\n\nAs usual, with any Burzum release, you simply cannot expect to experience the same emotions you've found on previous releases. For all its subtle similarities, there are just as many if not more differences found throughout Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Here, Vikernes has mastered the ambient half of his equation for the first time in memory. \"Tomhet\" is the most rapturous voyage he had yet penned outside his metal material, but its stunningly simple. Just about anyone with an inkling of how to hit a synthesizer chord and press a 'record' button could have performed this. And that's the beauty. The return to earth. To elements. The rustic, puerile charm. It's an enormous contrast to the charge of the first three tracks, and yet ironically the perfect post-script, as if all rising tension and glory led to its necessary calms.\n\nBecause of moments like this, Burzum is very often equated with being one of the few 'artists' within the metal sphere. I'm going to tell you that this is utter bullshit. Projected elitism. Bleary eyed snobby smearing. Virtual reality. If someone tells you this, hit them with a stick. Then hit them a second time, for me. Almost all metal through the ages, like other forms of the medium, have been art, just of varying strengths, purpose and size, of which we can argue until we're blue in the face. But that Vikernes is more 'artsy' than some would be hard to dispute. He conjures minimal aesthetics with a clear purpose. He's a masterful composer with few tools. A divisive engineer of aural frustrations. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is with ease one of his most potent statements, surpassed marginally by its successor in my reckoning, and only by a mere elbow's breadth. Armed with lyrics of loss and wrath, this album forms a unique bridge to the more historically, folk driven themes Vikernes would use on further efforts. It's not entirely flawless. There are a few minutes in the first two tracks that often cause some drift (not in the right direction), but on the whole this remains a desperate, delicate, intricate and destructive pleasure to experience.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nCompared to the lackluster chaff of the Aske EP, Burzum's 2nd full-length Det Som Engang Var ('What Once Was') must be the wheat, because it's an incredibly balanced offering that propels both Vikerne's metallic and ambient elements beyond the s/t debut, while slightly morphing the landscape to incorporate a darker, bolder production. We were given hints of this direction from the EP tracks \"Stemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet\" and the remake of \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\", which were actually recorded later than Det Som Engang Var and released first; but here upon the sophomore it's embedded directly into quality compositions that don't soon vacate the attention span.\n\nI also noticed a more prominent influence here from Hellhammer and early Celtic Frost, that being processed into the more virile, groove laden riffs scattered about the metal tracks, not unlike what Darkthrone were doing with their amazing sophomore A Blaze in the Northern Sky, but not quite so noisy or prominent. Det Som Engang Var is perhaps less chilly and droning than Burzum. Less ice remains nestled upon its eaves. Less dryness or droning. However, that tone has been replaced by a tangible maw of darkness that immediately consumes the listener, as if the iconic, evil fortress gates on the cover were to swallow you whole. There's a compelling amount of variation here that is not always felt throughout Burzum's career, though the focus on repetitious motifs has not been utterly abandoned. This album also sees the addition of clean vocals, which are somewhat unpolished but add a new dimension to the sound; and a mix of English and Norse lyrics that heavily favor the latter.\n\nThe ambient segments are confined to three tracks, beginning with the opener \"Den Onde Kysten (The Coast of Evil)\" which is frankly superb. Beautiful, tonal swelling curried through brooding feedback and crass ambiance and hints of longing, solemn majesty that are immediately beaten to death by the abrupt burst that is \"Key to the Gate\". \"Han Som Reiste\" is the sort of thriving electronic medieval dirge that Vikernes would later explore more broadly with his 1997 MIDI synthesizer album Dau\u00f0i Baldr. The last would be \"Svart Troner (Black Thrones)\", the outro, which is full of harsh, hissing ambiance, unwieldy percussive strikes, eerie higher-pitched backing synths and grueling chants and whispers. I should also mention here the guitar piece \"Naar Himmelen Klarner (When the Sky Clears)\", which furthers the style used on \"The Crying Orc\" or \"Dominus Sathanas\": simple and powerful instrumental rhythm affixed with thick bass accompaniment and some drums near its closure.\n\nBut as cool as these things are, the true strength of Det Som Engang Var comes through its strictly metallic passages. \"Key to the Gate\" is perhaps the least of these, but it successfully storms from a discordant, driving rhythm to the creepy enclosures of its core bridge, an early stab of suicidal, depressive notation that helped launch a few hundred bands in the 21st century, all intent on the same, minimalist torture. However, Burzum takes us by surprise here with some warmer, glorious melodies woven into the latter half of the track. \"En Ring Til Aa Herske (One Ring to Rule)\" introduces the chanting vocals and the drudging, swaggering grooves to a hypnotic level, as he lyrically hearkens back to the very inspiration of the band name. \"Lost Wisdom\" is my favorite here, in fact, one of my favorites in the whole discography; Celtic Frost styled swerving that alternates with a sheen of glacial, rime-encrusted sadness and some of Vikernes' most effective shrieking ever.\n\n\"Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn (Turn the Sign of Microcosm)\" is the most likely to wear out its welcome, being over 9 minutes in length, but it brilliantly shifts from a rather generic, straight blast of thick black metal to an amazing segment of plodding, numbing majesty at around 3:30, and it continues to dance in and out of this motif with some great if painfully simple drumming. I found the insertion of the clean, chanted vocals deeper in the bridge to be wholly satisfactory, and around 8:20 he retrieves the same, mesmerizing groove at exactly the right time to send off the song. It's this sort of decision which makes the man's songwriting so good.\n\nDet Som Engang Var is by no means a perfect album, but it is substantial. The variation Varg implies throughout the track list is welcome, and the production still holds up very well. I didn't enjoy it quite so much as the other major Norse black metal album of 1993, Under a Funeral Moon, but then I've never denied that I'm a sickly Darkthrone fan to begin with. That said, I feel that this sophomore is a step up from Burzum. I would number at least three of these tracks among his best (\"Lost Wisdom\", \"Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn\", \"En Ring Til Aa Herske\"). I still listen to fairly often as a whole, and it certainly belongs in the collection of any discerning heretic or cellar dweller.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOnly one year after the highly regarded Belus welcomed back the Norwegian killer Varg Vikernes into the metal scene, the American branch of Candlelight Records is releasing its follow up and the one man band\u2019s first official release in American shores, Fallen. Fallen signifies Vikernes\u2019 second attempt at playing metal after his stint in jail during which Varg developed a moronic neo nazi ideology, an allergy to anything that\u2019s not white and kept himself at bay from rock music because of its roots in black culture.\n\nUnlike the first phase of Burzum during which each album signified a sizeable step forward, Fallen is more of a step to the side, giving us results that are both unsurprising and surprising. Unsurprising because Fallen looks and sounds like the logical continuation of Belus. Where Burzum\u2019s classic releases made history with their monochromatic and amateurish artwork, now we are introduced to its not so black metal sound via classic images intended to portray the timeless Euro-centric beauty of nature (Belus) and of its ancestry (Fallen). In this occasion Elegy by French turn of century painter Adolphe-William Bouguereau graces the work of Vikergnes. \n\nLong gone are also the days of true aural grimness and sheer hate. Even better, long gone are the days of self-sabotaging one-finger-at-a-time Casio keyboard playing. Now, Burzum boasts melodic and jagged heavy metal guitars, frequent mid tempos, not so menacing BM vocals alongside spoken parts and catchy yet linear song arrangements.\n\nOn the other hand, Fallen is surprising because it is the softest metal release by Burzum to date. Was Vikernes to continue down this path he will end up recording for Napalm Records and playing pirate fests in Finland. Regardless of what the Count may say to the press via e-mail, he must be consuming lots of folk metal. Tracks like \u201cJeg Faller\u201d are only momentarily aggressive and sporadically metallic. At their core, these songs are tender, traditionally European and folksy, with choruses full of melody and longing for the tenderness of a white nipple.\n\nWhere Belus was dynamic and fast paced and included a couple of clearly outstanding tracks (namely \u201cKaimadalthas' Nedstigning\u201d) Fallen lacks aggression and does not present a clear winner at first listen. It is also full of hooks and hence, it is ready for mass consumption because its quotient of extreme metal is rather limited. Of the seven numbers included here only five (to some this may make Fallen an EP) are metal songs and these are flanked by a mediocre intro titled \u201cFra Verdenstreet\u201d and by an excruciatingly long (at less than six minutes it feels like it drags for twenty) and clumsy tribal oriental-sounding outro named \u201cTil Hel og Tilbake Igjen\u201d. I kid you not, its first half sounds like Chinese opera.\n\nBut those who loved the meat of Belus will find something to enjoy in Fallen. Melody reigns the metal songs and their core is all melancholy. In the fast part of \u201cJeg Faller\u201d Vikernes voice sounds spent and raspy, as if the man had aged a decade in the span of twelve months. So he speaks, sings minimally and vocalizes quietly longer passages just like he did in limited fashion in the previous record. If this approach is a sign of age, it is also reflected in his guitar playing. \u201cValen\u201d, like much of Fallen, is mid tempo. No frills or fills on the drums, multiple identity vocals and the repetitive and entrancing fingerwork of Vikernes. To a degree, these idiosyncratic and stylistic states are all trivialities; after all, the audience for Burzum has already been divided. And if you are still with him after that shoeless pic was printed on Terrorizer, you will probably also get a woody with Fallen.\n\nWritten for www.deafsparrow.com\n",
        "\nAdorned with its silent provocation of a burnt out Church, the Aske EP served as little more than a stopgap to Burzum's sophomore Det Som Engang Var (to come later the same year). However, this being the infamous act that it was and remains, and having been published through the legendary DSP imprint (before the murder), it's proven to be quite the collectors' item. Most people will have experienced this material as a part of the Burzum/Aske release compiled through Misanthropy Records, which uses only one of the version of the redundant track (\"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\"), but a more recent edition incorporates both the Aske and s/t editions of that track.\n\nNaturally, since that track was not a favorite of mine on the debut, I'm not in love with it here either. Again, not for a lack of substance, but simply too much of that substance bleated into oblivion, and the fact that Samoth (Emperor) appears here on the bass adds nothing for me. It unfortunately occupies over half of the content on this EP, severely diminishing the value I was able to draw forth from it. So my attentions here have always been turned towards the other pieces: \"Stemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet\" and \"Dominus Sathanas\". The first is a straight shot of mid paced archaic Norse black metal, with a thicker guitar tone than was found on Burzum (Samoth also performs the bass on this), leaden and hostile riffs that perfectly support Vikerne's even more harrowing, bloodied vocal presence. If I had a dime for every underground black metal crooner who apes this very voice, I could purchase most of Jan Mayen and the Scandinavian Peninsula, but in retrospect I don't find this particular song to be as stunning as most of those from the debut, despite the few glints of atmosphere.\n\n\"Dominus Sathanas\", though, is a curious departure which is probably best compared to the tiny track \"The Crying Orc\" from the first album. It's a guitar instrumental with screaming and bass lines, and the melodies are menacing and thick here, resonant against the void of percussion. If not for Varg's timely, carnal outburst, and the lack of drums, I'd very much compare this to something Candlemass or some other Gothic doom metal band might compose, and it has that same effect of gathering black clouds over the listener. Sad to say, it's the most intriguing piece on this album...\n\nGauging any real value here is perplexing. For its day, 'Ashes' was a nice limited run affair that fans could get their paws on, and original copies probably still fly off the auctions. But honestly there's just not enough to it that I'd ever get excited. \"Stemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet (The Voice of the Tower)\" is the first Burzum track delivered in the Norse tongue, and notable for that reason, but it's not nearly the most engrossing that he's written. \"Dominus Sathanas\" continues to exhibit Varg's incorporation of instrumental material to his releases (I won't count the screams), and it's not bad. \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" is slightly more energetic in this environment than on the debut. All three work wonderfully as a bonus to the Burzum CD but independently there is not much to say for this. Collectors, get excited if you find an original kicking around. For anyone else, there is vastly superior Burzum music to invest in.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe lone wanderer in mist. The shade itself. The black and white image which graces the cover of the 1992 Burzum s/t debut could not be more suited to the musician behind its conception, for Varg Vikernes (Count Grishnackh) has always seen fit to tread a path apart, of his own making, for better or worse. But outside of the notoriety this individual has created through his statements and actions, Burzum is actually a pretty poignant album because of the fundamentals it established. Vikernes is by no means the first human being to write and perform all instruments on an album (even a metal album) himself, but as far as the solitary aesthetic within this particular genre, the 'one man' black metal band, its obvious that the breadcrumb aspirations of many future suitors could be traced back to this particular Norse granary.\n\nFor another, Vikernes had set out to separate himself from what he considered dangerous trend and mediocrity within the reaches of extreme metal, the ever technically inclined gear whoring that death metal had become in its incessant strive towards brutality. Burzum is not the work of a man hanging out about his local music store offering fellatio to the latest brand name wizardry, but that of a minimalist. One who enters the audio market with nothing other than a daring imagination and whatever instruments are on hand. I've got no particular gripe with musicians who are particular about what equipment they use, mind you. To each his own. Engineering, tonal quality and the visual aesthetics of instruments and amplifiers are obviously of great importance to a great many composers and performers. However, I would be lying to say that I didn't find Varg's ethics for the time to be refreshing; the Burzum album itself is ample proof that such a philosophy could translate into memorable, important music.\n\nAnd memorable this debut is, as one of the most primal offerings of its variety, yet satisfyingly structured. This is a cut above demo or rehearsal level quality, but implicitly simple. You won't hear the crashing calamity of Venom at the dawn of the 80s, or the first three ripping Bathory LPs, but a contrast of calm, flowing melodies and Varg's wraith-like, shrieking vocals which felt borne more of direct pain than pleasing harmony; as if he was stabbing himself in the foot while hurtling dark promises into the studio microphone, howling as often as delivering the lyrics. The drums are competent but dry, tinny cadences delivered through slow to mid paces, heavier on the snare and cymbals than the bass and toms. The axes shorn of repetitious, carnal melodies that eschew complexity for dramatic desolation; the few lead lines kept close to the rhythmic skeleton (as in \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\"). The bass is the antithesis of rocket science, as it too hovers very near the guitar passages, a shadow of certainty.\n\nThe consistency of its content is the one region in which this album suffers, albeit a very mild ailment. The first 5-6 tracks are captivating, but once it spins off into its more expansive pieces like \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" or \"My Journey to the Stars\", I got the impression that the riffs were overwrought and slowly lost their gathered luster. Not the case for \"Feeble Screams from Forests Unknown\", with its immediate charge into harrowing, belligerent agony, or the subtly shifts in \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\" (the alternating chord pattern at 2:20 is stupendously eerie and enthralling). Not the case either for \"Spell of Destruction's\" bleak crawling, or the abrupt shift towards straight, dirty heavy metal that is \"War\" (with a central riff reminiscent of Destruction's \"Curse the Gods\", or the bridge of Sabbath's legendary \"Symptom of the Universe\"). But \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" taunts us with a few mesmeric passages and then beats us in the face with them until we're numb of being numb; and the same could almost be said for \"My Journey to the Stars\", 1-2 decent riffs and transitions but ultimately the guitars and double bass drive are not all that appealing.\n\nBurzum also features a few ambient excursions, perhaps an unintended prospectus on what was to follow on ensuing efforts, but tasteful enough. \"Channeling the Power of Souls into a New God\" is simply a pair of primitive synth lines, one droning powerfully the with backing notes, the other repeating a melancholic, softer pattern alongside, almost like some mausoleum in a primitive video game soundtrack. \"Dungeons of Darkness\" is the more interesting, with a dark swell of implied subterranean atmosphere that slowly erupts into loose percussion, tumescent synthesizers capped off in freakish electrodes. There's also \"The Crying Orc\", which is less than a minute of simple guitar melodies ringing off into the mists, but the notation here isn't given the time it would need to manifest the listener's sorrow.\n\nIn the end, I found there to be about 40 out of 48 minutes here which have compelled me through the years to revisit. This is raw imagination, stripped of excess ballast and sincere in its reproach towards humanity, evoked here through lyrical libations to Babylonian myth (\"Ea\"), fantasy, destruction and dour mysticism. Burzum is not the most impressive of Varg's albums in hindsight, but it lays much of the brickwork that favorites like Filosofem and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss would stand upon, and it speaks with a voice of its own, a frightening and permeating chill at any depth of comprehension. As a work of influence, it drowns even that.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nReflecting on speculations regarding any famous or infamous artist\u2019s up and coming work can get boring after a while, and the atmosphere surrounding the release of one of the more infamous black metal maestros Varg Vikernes is among the more extreme examples. It\u2019s a strange thing how a person\u2019s biography can get so overblown in underground circles that you find yourself not caring yet anymore, and simultaneously the music just keeps roping the listener back in. But whatever the hidden charm is behind the fuzzy guitars and Norwegian dark speak, the creature that is Burzum is among the more addictive of extreme metal creations out there, particularly in low-fi circles.\n\n\u201cBelus\u201d is more a reassertion than a new experiment, a reminder if you will that the dark winds of Mordor still blow is heavy gusts despite being locked away for just under 2 decades. Gone are the days of ambient experimentation with keyboards while in the solitude of prison, and back are the frostbitten tremolo guitar melodies and esoteric ramblings of the paroled poet. And just like the good old days, the songs are long and involved, though the actual content is presented in a minimalist manner, emphasizing repetition with little variation or contrast, and maintaining the meditation music tendencies that have always been present in Varg\u2019s creations.\n\nBut as much as this is an album marked by a loyal conservatism, it also shows signs of growth and evolution within its allegedly strict and narrow template. The melodic material seems partially borrowed from older material, and in the case of the \u201cBelus' D\u00f8d\u201d is an actual quotation of one of Varg\u2019s creations from his ambient days, but it has also been varied and elaborated to the point where it almost comes off as progressive. \u201cKaimadalthas' Nedstigning\u201d particularly combines a few early 90s blackened thrash ideas with this new melodic, almost post-rock character present here, which is basically a higher fidelity version of the sound that cropped up on \u201cFilosofem\u201d.\n\nThe biggest changes in the format, however, are to be found in Varg\u2019s vocal delivery, which has taken on a duality of sadness and viciousness. Gone are the piercing cries of agony with a latent hardcore punk character, and in their place is a multifaceted mixture of orthodox blackened barks that are a bit closer to Nocturno Culto\u2019s death-like wolf growl, alongside a mixture of spoken narrations and a fatalistic baritone chant with a flat, hopeless melodic character. Particularly in the case of the long winded, shimmering musical dream vision \u201cGlemselens Elv\u201d, this clean vocals function almost like the stand-ins for the now absent keyboards, tempering a rough edged ripple of blast beats and nebulous riffs with a soft, sustained counterpoint.\n\nAs a whole, this is another classic release from someone who obviously doesn\u2019t qualify for human being of the century, but is good at what he does regardless. It\u2019s a bit less distinctive of a part of Burzum\u2019s history and occasionally listens like an updated version of \u201cFilosofem\u201d with a different production and vocal display, but as an individual album it is a strong offering for a year where black metal seems to be about genre expansionism rather than getting back to basics. It is understandable that based on a formula that is somewhat derivative of the past that a few fans with really high expectations might not consider this an accomplishment, but speaking for myself, it\u2019s about as good as one can expect from a buy whose been out of the game for over 20 years.\n",
        "\nLast year's Belus was a welcome return for Burzum. It was a fairly decent record, but it lacked something. I found myself listening to Belus only once in a while. Still, it wasn't bad and i was eager to see where Varg Vikernes would go from there. As Vikernes has always done(when he's not been in jail), he has put out another album in the space of exactly 1 year. After multiple listens of the album, I have concluded that this is a much more whole album than Belus. I thought Belus was a collection of old and new riffs Varg had written. It didn't flow together as an album very well. This is where Fallen succeeds.\n\nThe album opens with \"Fra Verdenstreet\", a creepy and short introduction. Then comes \"Jeg Faller\", one of my favourites on Fallen. The riffs on this song are very catchy, and the chorus showcases Varg's vocal ability. His clean vocals on Fallen were a pleasant surprise. He uses them more often than ever before, and they work well with the music. The chanted chorus to Vanvidd is another good example of this.\n\nOn the older Burzum albums, Varg opted for simple but effective riffs. As he's gotten older, i think his playing skills have improved. The guitar tone is distorted and tremolo riffs are abundant. The production as a whole is cleaner than on Belus. The drums, which as always was the case with Burzum, compliment the music well enough and are not overly technical. They are also much more audible than they were on Belus. Some of the basslines on Fallen are pretty decent. The 10 minute long \"Budstikken\" in particular shines in this aspect.\n\n\"Enhver Til Sitt\" features a doom-ish melody in the chorus with some harsh spoken vocals over it. In the press release for Fallen, we found out that there was going to be an ambient track on the album. \"Til Hel Og Tilbake Igjen\" is the ambient conclusion; it is different from the ambient tracks on the likes of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem, and I was hoping for something like \"Tomhet\"(off of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss). However, this is very different. Pounding drums, noise, and incoherent whispered vocals are to be found on \"Til Hel Og Tilbake Igjen\" for the first 5 minutes. Then, everything fades away as we are hit by some beautiful guitar notes. Perhaps a bit drawn out, but the conclusion fits the mood of the album and ends it on a sad, sorrowful note.\n\nWith Fallen, i think the \"new\" Burzum style which started from Belus, has reached its peak. Fallen is a more thought-out and finished product than Belus. It will be interesting to see where Vikernes goes from here though. He has long abandoned the black metal that he helped create, but I for one am hoping his next release will step away from the styles of Belus and Fallen and be more unique, as Filosofem was. Perhaps this apparent re-recording of older tracks will get Vikernes in touch with the side of him that produced masterpieces like Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem.\n",
        "\nWhere Burzum is concerned, it is very difficult to separate the musical content of an album from the aura of controversy surrounding the name. Perhaps the only people who are gifted with not being swept away totally by the mystique of early 2nd wave history are indifferent individuals like myself who can\u2019t be bothered with the nationalistic/political causes tied in with a particular scene. Even when most adherents tend to say that black metal can not be separated from the message, I say otherwise, and it is often to Varg\u2019s eccentric concoctions that I turn to as an example of how my own side interest in minimalist music and Norse legends is sufficient to enjoy the music created by a man known affectionately as the Charles Manson of Norway.\n\nFrom a historical standpoint, \u201cFallen\u201d doesn\u2019t really stand out as having a particular tie to anything in Burzum\u2019s past, though the post-rock sounding guitar tone is heavily reminiscent of \u201cFilosofem\u201d. This is more a collection of narratives than an excursion into atmospheric depths as was the case with \u201cDet Som Engang Var\u201d or his widely heralded masterwork \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d. Repetition is a key factor, but there is a layering of contrasting guitar parts that simulates the waves of an ocean as they toss a boat to and fro. But in spite of a very dense collage of minimalist guitar melodies and broken up chords, the feel of this is very straight-lined. Though there is a charm in this strict consistency in that it plays into the general trance character that Varg has continually kept with him since his ambient releases and was a definite factor on \u201cBelus\u201d, which I regard as a somewhat lesser yet still powerful work.\n\nPerhaps the biggest point of contrast at work here is the highly prominent clean vocals, which do much to shape the narrative character of the album. Through much of the full length compositions that occur between the opening and closing ambient works, there is the feel of introspective thought that is articulated through spoken and grunted verses, but they always seem to come back to this notion of a latent liturgical chant. This is particularly the case on \u201cJeg Faller\u201d, where the hypnotic restatement of a melodic fragment in a thoughtful and somber baritone almost mimics an ancient Gregorian chant sound. Other longer passages of melodic yet minimal singing phase in and out of the mesmerizing epic \u201cBudstikken\u201d, which is unto itself a dreamy mix of shimmering tremolo melodies that function almost like a 10 minute lullaby into the waiting arms of an inevitable grave.\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t really reach the caliber level of the pre-prison era of Burzum, it is very clear that Varg has a consistent and worthy approach to continuing his musical vision, and it is something that can be appreciated by most fans of the older material. Aside from a little venture into a mishmash of tribal and avant-garde music on the closing instrumental, this is a very conservative compilation of musical elements that acknowledge, though don\u2019t attempt to relive the past. It is slightly more enticing than \u201cBelus\u201d, but largely follows the same general format, and while surprises tend to be few here, the quality of the consistency at work here is enough to send notions of compulsory innovation literally \u201cTo Hel And Back Again\u201d.\n",
        "\nBurzum is a nostalgic name for me. I remember being in high school wearing my black metal patches and listening to Aske and Deathcrush (Mayhem). I was one of the few kids in the scene that never really got involved in the Burzum v. Mayhem thing. So Euronymous got stabbed by Varg\u2026big deal. They were both kids and both were idiots. It\u2019s just two people. Besides, Euronymous only wrote one good full length and one good EP. For a while, it was hard to expect Varg Vikernes to make any new music (other than his shitty ambient) since he was in jail, but it happened. In 2010, he graced us with Belus, a Filosofem revival sound. It was mediocre compared to Filosofem, however, but still decent enough to listen to. Not even a year later, and Varg released Fallen\u2026and it\u2019s amazing.\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that it is seriously exactly like Filosofem, unlike Belus, which only drew influence from that album. Most of the songs have the same exact rythem, length, meter and tone as Filosofem. Hell, even some of the lyrics are the same. This is both a bad thing and a good one.\n\nBad for the fact that he didn\u2019t really try too terribly hard to find a new sound\u2026but hey, it\u2019s black metal, what do you expect? Progression?\n\nIt\u2019s good though, because Filosofem was amazing, and probably my favorite Burzum album following Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, which was by far his best album.\n\nI was impressed with the overall sound though. It felt really atmospheric and shoegazy. That\u2019s the type of Burzum I like\u2026not the one when his singing is huh\u2026wow (all you true Burzum fans will get the joke). Varg really changed his screaming - even since the last album. It\u2019s more focused, less about being polarizing, more about being true to his beliefs, emotions, thoughts and music. I really liked his melodic vocals and spoken word parts in most every song. The first time I heard him sing, I was so glad, I think I cried a little.\n\nThere\u2019s never much to say about the instrumentals for Burzum (guitar, bass and drums usually focus on the same structure - Power chords or tremolo picking, simplistic open note chords for bass, blast beats or eighth note drums), though one stands out. The end track, \u201cTil Hel og Tilbake Igjen\u201d. This song was so un-Burzum. It was basically just drums, but it was amazing. It was almost drone (a genre I am very in love with). It reminded me of much of the Dronevil album (Boris, 2005).\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s better than Belus, about on par with Filosofem, but still didn\u2019t come close to Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, and I don\u2019t think anything of his ever will. If anything, get the album to hear his new sound. Download it if you have to, but I know that I\u2019ll shell out the 15 bucks to get this album when I have the money.\n",
        "\nBands never really make full comebacks when they go bad, a metalhead knows this better than anyone. But in retrospect, Varg never really did lose his musical touch, he was just unable to utilize it when stuck in a jailcell with nothing but a keyboard. To say the least, I was very pleasantly surpised with this album, having my expectations set down by the underwhelming Belus. I can understand taking an album or two to get back on your feet after a decade of inactivity, and Varg does this gracefully with Fallen. \n\nThe guitar tone is sharp and buzzy as you'd come to expect from Burzum, reminicent of Filosofem but much more in the spectrum of a \"normal\" guitar tone. It fits perfectly with the feel of this album, piercing you with a cold treble rather than bassy warmth. Just what every black metal album needs.\n\nThe drums are well-played and perfectly audible whether it be blast beats or normal rhythms, a large improvement over the muffled sound of Belus. Given, they are more repetitive than other drumming jobs you might hear, but that's always been Vargs style. the drums don't always need to overshadow everything, they just need to work well with the song. This also holds true for the bass. The guitars are really the center of this album, and the bass compliments them well without being overbearing or underwhelming.\n\nThe only thing I would change about this album is Varg's vocals. while I do like the new \"evil goblin\" style vocals, I would prefer the tortured cries of old Burzum any day. Maybe Varg can't do his old vocal style after being in prison for over a decade, who knows. I just know that Varg has plenty of vocal talent he could build upon. Speaking of which, the clean vocals on this album are a welcome addition. they are pretty frequent on this album, so it's a good thing that he does them well. they really make this album feel authentically Norwegian, as opposed to many bands where you don't care because they all sound the same.\n\nIt's good to see that one of the former kings of Norwegian black metal is back on his throne. I hope that there will be many more Burzum albums in the future, judging by the current direction he is headed. I would definitely recommend Fallen to anyone with an interest in Burzum\n",
        "\nI have been listening to Burzum for about 12 years. I know all of the albums inside and out (I\u2019m not counting the keyboard albums). I enjoy all of the albums and I don\u2019t think it is important to say what album I think is best because anyone reading this is probably a fan of Burzum and has their own favorite for their own reasons. But, I can say the Fallen is my least favorite album to be released by Varg thus far (again, excluding the keyboard albums\u2026 they don\u2019t really count in my opinion).\n\nYes, I did enjoy Belus. I was pleasantly surprised by the album, even though some songs sounded too familiar, but that was better than straying from the old Burzum sound and style. And, I do enjoy Fallen as well, but if I had to throw away one album this would be the one.\n\nHere is my take on the last 2 albums. If Fallen was released first, I would like say I like it more than Belus. I find both albums have a similar sound and feel, although Fallen does have more clean vocals (too much, maybe?). My overall problem with the last 2 releases is the drums. Varg\u2019s drums are way too boring in many of the songs. The tracks with straight 4/4 timing are fine. The songs with blast beats don\u2019t bore me either. But, the other songs\u2026 he plays the exact same drums beat. I mean, really? That\u2019s the best you can do? I don\u2019t expect anything great, but play a fill every once in a while, or at least change up the beat a little. Just a little\u2026\n\nSome people are going to say \u201cYou just don\u2019t get it\u2026 It is meant to be minimal\u2026 etc. etc. etc.\u201d Yeah that is true, but is it meant to be boring?\n\nNot going to list the song titles but part of track 2, all of track 3, most of track 5 uses the \u2018boring\u2019 beat I am talking about. The songs don\u2019t feel like they are 'pushing' enough.\n\nAnd while I'm complaining about this track 3 of Belus uses that beat as well and it\u2019s my favorite track on the album.\n\nSo, for me the album is not bad. I still enjoy it. The vocals are decent even if a little too many clean vocals are present. The guitar is typical Burzum. And the bass... Well, who cares about the bass, but it is there and can be heard and adds to the song, especially Budstikken.\n\nFallen is an album that fans of Burzum will listen to and enjoy. But it may be the album you end up listening to the least after the \u2018newness\u2019 of it wears thin. Another fairly solid release from Varg Vikernes, even if the drums are starting to bore me to death.\n",
        "\nAbout the only characteristic not in dispute of Burzum's 2010 album Belus was the vast amount of curious anticipation that it incited in not only those who had been following Varg's music since the 90s, but the wider range of hangers on and the irony crowd that his work sadly draws like hipsters to a keffiyeh vendor. A circus of mock admirers drawn to a controversial history. As for the actual content of that album, I was quite disappointed, as I found very few of the guitar passages to inspire me. In retrospect, I believe it is the very worst album of the entire Burzum lexicon: not innately terrible by any means, and nearly capturing the raw fervor and intensity of a Det Som Engang Var or Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, but falling well short in the dust.\n\nI was thus pleasantly surprised that Vikernes has followed that act with Fallen, an appropriately mesmeric experience that has exceeded my expectations for his post-incarceration material, reducing Belus to a mere warm-up towards a heightened, creative expression. You will recognize the staples of his past here: tortured and direct rasped vocals with almost no filtration, long passages of repetitious guitars, and a rare ability to entrance you with a musical subtext. But there are a few new tricks here, like the numbing and soothing vocals that add a new layer of unexpected accessibility to the material, or the curving, delicious bass grooves that hover off to the edge of the guitar rhythms, content with the slightly strained perception that the listener will require to absorb them. As for the guitars themselves, they're delivered in a caustic, glittering range of higher pitched notes that simply leap out of the recording as if you were catching them on your own set of strings, your own shining amplification.\n\nNearly the entirety of Fallen provides an absorbing experience, but in particular I was enamored with \"Vanvidd\" for its somber, sullen clean vocals that contrast the razor thin tremolo picking; \"Jeg faller\" for mutation a fairly standard onslaught of black metal notation into a fabric of bright pain, with bass/spoken word vocal segues, a hypnotic curve to the bass and a strangely catchy, if predictable chorus; or \"Budstikken\", the longest track at over 10 minutes, which wonderfully carries a number of riffs through a thick bass line and gentle spikes of variation and torture, like watching a frost settle over quivering, muted water color hills. \"Enhver til sitt\" also borders on stunning, with cautious, eerie guitars delivered in haunting simplicity, and vocals that range from a forced whisper to an outburst of agony. Perhaps the one central track I'm not fully feeling is \"Valen\", though the vocals are again worthwhile and there's a decent, descending melody in the guitar line that does affix the ear. I think in the end I just didn't feel like it filled out its 9+ minutes to contentment.\n\nThe album is book ended by a pair of ambient tracks, \"Fra verdenstreet\" involving a ritual-like repetition of whispers over rising dissonance and dripping; the much longer \"Til hel og tillbake igjen\" a skilled and sparse balance of traditional percussion and strings that proves Vikernes is still on top of his experimentation. Neither distracts, not interrupts the steady flow of the core metal compositions. Then there's the partial use of Bouguereau's classic painting 'Elegy' on the cover, which only too well suits the music within. Fallen is likely to distance those who would probably have enjoyed a more abrupt return to the harsher environments of Vikerne's past works, or even those who think with longing on the pure ambient, glorious tones of the late 90s synthesizer albums. But to these ears, it's ultimately a finely wrought fabric of melodic indulgence through which the knives of dissent and isolation still stab out.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBurzum... Varg Vikernes... one of the most famous (or infamous) metal musicians ever. Burning churches, murdering people, you know the deal. However, I have never listened to his first demo, until today. Believe me folks, this is true evil black metal at its finest. No blast beats, no fast drum patterns, no vocals (huh? yeah, it's true), just eerie, highly distorted, low quality produced music. Extremely harsh and ear raping (good for me, bad for many), this is something a true black metal fan (or weird music altogether) should definitely not miss, for you shall not be dissapointed. \n\nThe atmosphere is just brilliant, like something you would hear in your nightmares; truly evil. Maybe gothic people claim they're evil and dark, but they're not close to this. Gothic music makes you think of darkness, only with a light. Like there's some sort of hope. You stand in the darkest place, but you can still see the light. While the song ''channeling the power of souls into a new god'', for example, brings you to a place where there's absolute darkness, ghastly sounds and no hope.\n\nBlack metal demos are usually like this. Raw, harsh and really agressive. And this is certainly not the exception. So, if you want to hear the soundtrack for pure darkness, this is the perfect choice.\n",
        "\nIt seems difficult to base a critique of any work of art upon arbitrary or commonly-accepted standards when such a work is expressly and explicitly intended by design to not fit within the confines of normal definitions. In this case, Burzum\u2019s Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is most aptly described as black metal, and yet, even though that is the best description of the record\u2019s sound, it is not only black metal. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss has been called ambient music, or electronic music, or neofolk, and yet, even though those phrases do describe parts of this album, it is neither completely ambient nor wholly electronic. The music of Burzum was never intended to fully fit within a genre, never meant to allow itself to be defined by a word or a phrase. The goal of Varg \u201cCount Grishnackh\u201d Vikernes, in composing music as Burzum, was to create a sound which was a mirror of his soul, a sound all his own and not identical to the prevailing death and black metal music of the day. Rather than pummeling the listener into submission with a blistering message of death, hate, and gore, pounded into his ears by scathing guitar lines and relentless drum fills, Vikernes\u2019 music insinuates itself into the listener\u2019s psyche. Repetitive themes, unwavering drums, and comparatively simple guitar chords combine magically to create a sound unlike any other. A \u201cmagical\u201d combination indeed, oddly enough, as such was the full intent of Vikernes \u2013 to try his hand at magic, to create \u201cnachtmusik\u201d, music to be played in the evening (\u201cabendmusik\u201d then, if you will). As one fell asleep, conjured images of high fantasy would cast a Spell upon the listener, revealing to him a world quite unlike his own and yet so similar; displaying for him the darkness that was in truth the repressed goodness deeply latent within our own existence and upon this Earth we call home.\n\nThe opening incantation of the Spell of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is the song Det som en gang var (which, translated from Norwegian, signifies What once was). This song opens the listener\u2019s mind to the full Spell of the record, preparing him to receive its message. The songs Hvis lyset tar oss (If the light takes us) and Inn i slottet fra dr\u00f8mmen (Into the castle from the dream) follow, their goal to weaken the listener\u2019s hold upon his way of thinking, his adherence to logic and the accepted ways of this world - to make him the more ready once the final phrases of the Spell are cast. The Spell of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss concludes with the lengthy ambient track Tomhet (Emptiness), and with this song Vikernes succeeds in persuading the mind of his listener, now primed and open for guidance, and once the mind lets loose its hold upon this world, Vikernes has captured the heart. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, perhaps more than any other Burzum record, masterfully fulfills the design of creating magic within the heart and mind of the listener.\n\nThe record begins comparatively slowly. Det som en gang var, for the first three minutes or so, moves almost despondently, as though the guitars are being stroked aimlessly, mournfully. But Vikernes is establishing a mood, and these first three minutes succeed in doing just that. Setting the tone for this record as one slightly less angered than the subsequent Filosofem, Vikernes lets us know early that this album will be mournful and contemplative. Once Det som en gang var begins to increase its speed, we begin to see, even though the bard relating a tale to us is saddened and wishes us to be so as well in order to best understand him, that there is something which we must hear and understand. When Det som en gang var has completed and Hvis lyset tar oss begins, we see a more urgent side in our storyteller. We empathize with him as his statements come swifter and more imperatively. Inn i slottet fra dr\u00f8mmen increases the urgency even further, almost frantically pleading with us to hearken, and features considerable discordant harmonies that serve to stir us to thought and wonder even further. By the time Tomhet begins, we are completely and totally in the power of the storyteller, and we are ready to receive his magic tale. Tomhet takes us on a journey through two landscapes, two far-away places represented by sound. The first of these is bleak, and, while interesting to us, is an echo of the despondency which we knew originated somewhere mysterious when we first heard it in Det som en gang var. As we travel from the first landscape to the second, we come to know the full measure of despondency, a moment in time of quiet sorrow. The second landscape opens our eyes to the fact that, though valuable in and of itself, despondency, when tempered with fantastic thoughts and realizations we had never conceived, can only make us stronger. As Tomhet ends and the full spell of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is complete, we finally come to understand that our own world is not that different from the land of magic which we have visited, but that the shadowy things here are not as dark as we have been led to believe.\n\nAs far as an analysis of the music itself is concerned, Burzum in general is not a technically proficient, perfect sound, but it was never intended to be. Just as mistakes in life make up the human character, so mistakes in Vikernes\u2019 music define its character and make it personal. But what mistakes there are on this album are negligible. The production is standard for the time and for the black metal to which Vikernes was for the most part adhering. The production is not as low quality as on the album which follows, Filosofem, but neither is it of such a high quality as to make the music sound sterile. There is more distortion during the first three songs than the closing track, of course, but, as Tomhet is digitally produced, this is only to be expected. In any case, it seems appropriate that the \u201cpreparation tracks\u201d are more distorted, making them more \u201cdifficult to comprehend\u201d and piquing the listener\u2019s interest, while Tomhet is clear and there is no mistaking the intent of the prime words of the Spell. The mood is very well established throughout the album, mainly by the guitar and by the excellent use of keyboards. Guitars are strummed either very slowly and the note held for some time, or are picked tremolo for a continuous sound. Often, the keyboards will take over the main statement of themes from the guitar, the latter fading into the background. The keyboards are not overdone by any means. Quite frequently, especially in this latter day of black metal, keyboards/synthesizers see considerably more use than they should (or at least more elaborate use, or are just plain too loud in the mix), but Vikernes has perfectly mixed them with the guitars on this album. Drums are mainly used for backing, to assist the guitar and the keyboards in the storytelling. There is nothing fancy in the drumming, with hardly any fills to speak of and almost no change throughout an entire song, but the position in the mix of the drum track is perfect, neither overpowering nor too quiet. The drumming, of course, increases pace with the rest of the instruments in the second and third songs, but becomes ever slightly more urgent than it had been previously, even slightly aggressive. Vikernes\u2019 signature vocals, perhaps the most emotive harsh vocals in metal music, combine elements of shrieking, weeping, and angry screams all into one sound. The vocals on this album are particularly clear, the voice and its tone quite distinguishable. We can usually identify quickly our storyteller\u2019s mood. Though still obscured to some extent by the low production, the vocals on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss are quite more distinct that those on Filosofem. The heavily distorted vocals of the latter album fit its mood well, but the clearer treatment of vocals on Hvis compliment the music perfectly. The question of negative comments regarding this album, or things in need of improvement, is a delicate one. Change one aspect of this record, and the music one loves today will not be the same. The drums could be slightly more imaginative - perhaps a few fills to underscore important statements within the music or to signify approaching changes in theme and therefore thought. Guitar solos are not necessarily needed, at least not in the standard idea of a guitar solo, but perhaps in the more mournful sections a lonely guitar playing by itself for a bar or two might have worked well with the overall sound. But even these suggestions are only minor thoughts, and not significant grievances which in any way detract from the experience. It is very challenging to find a legitimate aspect of this album which needs to be changed in order to increase the delight of listening to this record. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss achieves its goal mainly by repetition, in the restatement of a theme with small variations throughout. Guitars state one theme, and then keyboards state another. Drums keep our thoughts continuous, and emphasize the guitar and keys. The vocals let us know that we are not alone on this journey, instructing and guiding us as we fall under the album\u2019s Spell.\n\nHvis Lyset Tar Oss has been called the greatest black metal album ever released, and its opening track, Det som en gang var, the greatest black metal song ever recorded. The quandary in such a statement is that Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Det som en gang var are not merely black metal. They are Burzum, and Burzum by definition is Darkness, the shining of a unique light into a shadowy world where seas of sound are all alike. The music of the Darkness lights the way of those who care to listen, and the music of the Darkness is Burzum.\n",
        "\nSo here I am, seven months after the long awaited release of Burzum's 'Belus'. There are two simple reasons that this album was so looked forward to: Burzum, once arguably the biggest black metal band out there, has had a 11-year hiatus, due to Varg Vikernes (that's 'vee-ker-niss') being imprisoned for murder. (Varg Vikernes being the man behind Burzum, who does all the instruments and vocals). The other reason being that, if you haven't noticed, black metal as a genre has taken a turn for the worst. Every great band (Emperor, Dimmu Borgir, Darkthrone, Mayhem) has either broken up or allowed their music to turn into garbage. I guess that made Belus the album people hoped would bring back black metal to its underground, unheard of, nitty-gritty glory. And let me say that I am one of the people who was rabid with anticipation. I wasn't there when Varg Vikernes started Burzum. I wasn't there when he released his albums (at least, I wasn't into heavy metal) and now, I was witnessing a comeback that almost nobody thought would happen. And I was ready for a great album. \n\nEventually, the album came out. It was called Belus, named after the same mythological god that Burzum's ambient albums were based on (nice to know Varg is still obsessed with the same story after 13 years)... With learning this, I figured that Varg would be doing his ambient albums with guitars, drums, and vocals. Then I saw the album artwork, and had another wierd feeling that this album would be dissapointing. To me, every Burzum album before Belus had perfect cover art: it really depicted the atmosphere in each album, and eccentuated the atmosphere. This... I dunno about this. A lush, green photograph of trees? Looks like a picture you would see on the label of a bottle of water... they could call it the 'Spring Quencher'! \n\nAs far as the music goes, I guess I would call Belus very similar to Burzum's '96 release, 'Filosofem', mainly because of the production: tinny, hissing guitars, low bass, scratchy vocals... the only major difference is the drums are much more audible... though that isn't saying much. Simply put, the guitars dominate everything, and that's clear from the start. The atmosphere of Belus is what I'd describe as being sleepy, monotone... but with intention. Sure, the album lacks agression, but then again, Varg asserted before the release of Belus that his fans should not expect to hear agressive intensity. This sleepy atmosphere took a LOT of getting used to though. If you've ever heard an album called 'Forgotten Legends' by a band called Drudkh, then you'll know what I mean. This album does vary and have more range than Forgotten Legends, but it does strike the same droning tone. Remember, I heard Belus right when it was released, didn't like it, and now, seven months later, although I'm not in love with it, I can see what Varg was trying to do. Concerning the vocals, I guess I was really anticipating the trademark wails and screams of Varg Vikernes: the dark, foreboding, torturous noises he can make really added a lot of passion and energy to an album... one you got used to them. I heard from quite a few Burzum fans that they too were dissapointed with the retreading of the Filosofem vocals, but I can think of two big reasons that Varg didn't use the regular approach. For one thing, the last time Varg recorded those types of vocals was back in 1992, during the recording of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, when Varg was just nineteen. He's a thirty-seven year old man now, and his vocals probably ain't what they used to be. Also, this album has a sort of droning, medetative pace to it. It uses monotony as an intended atmosphere, and his softer growl and tremolo picked guitars have a sort of soft, blanketed feel. If Varg had been doing his regular wailing his head off, it would have been harder to sustain the soft, sleepy feeling he was trying to portray. Aside from those Filosofem-esque growls, we also get a bigger taste of Varg's soft, casually sung voice, especially in the song 'Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning', which has more singing than growling. \n\nBelus starts with the closest thing that you'll get to 'synth' in this album: the sound of someone turning an empty can of spray-paint upside down over and over again. Kind of annoying... What it's doing on this album, God knows. It's dissapointing too, because I thought that Burzum's strong point in the albums 'Filosofem' and 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' was the use of keyboards to eccentuate (never dominate) the music. Not to mention the odd keyboard driven instrumentals (songs like 'Han Som Rieste' and 'Tomhet') are sorely missed. That makes this Burzum's first album that is completely devoid of keyboards... and how does that fair out? Well... not good. It's not necessarily terrible; in fact it's far from it. It just strips this album of a lot of its potential range. \n\nAnother problem a lot of people complain about when referring to Belus is the fact that the riffs are repeated ad-infinitum throughout each song. There's usually an A-B-A-B-A-B-C-A-C-A-C kind of pattern going, although of course that's only in general. The thing that needs attention are the subtleties. There are little subtle changes in the patterns; whether it's a drumming alteration, or the tempo is tweaked a little, or the guitar riffs start differing slightly, and once you start to pick them out (which takes some concentration in the music) it should become easier to sit through the album, and even make the album enjoyable. \n\nIn the end, Belus is not a bad album. It's a good album, sure, but for Burzum it is very sub-standard and dissapointing. It goes on for longer than it should, and sometimes the repetition of the riffs doesn't feel justified... But mostly, it just isn't very definitive for Burzum, let alone black metal. Every other black metal Burzum album is great to me, and helped define black metal in some way at the time of its release. The self-titled debut helped establish the black metal style of drumming and tremolo-picked guitar work, Det Som Engang Var set the slower, darker pace with dark interludes, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss set the less-than-eight track listing of drawn out, atmospheric soundscapes and contemplative songwriting, Filosofem established the minimalistic era, with a lot of long ambient stretches and intentionally bad production, and you couldn't find any other album like it at the time of release. For Belus, it just isn't that unique. Wolves in the Throne Room and early Drudkh come to mind when listening to this. I guess that's what hurts this album the most. And referring again to the album art, I still don't like it at all. I tried to come up with a good mental picture that would work with the music from the album and what I got was the image of a crow flying over mountains and forests, eclipsing the sun. Anyway, if you're a fan of Wolves in the Throne Room sort of stuff, you'll really appreciate this album. If you're looking for Varg's masterpiece, if you're a big Burzum fan looking for a great, innovative and daring new album, or a very heavy EXTREME album, you are going to be dissapointed. I don't think Varg's mentality for the album had to do with being HARSH N BROOTAL YO. I think he was going for a sleepier, more melancholy feel, and the production reflects that. All in all, Varg made an album that acheived the atmosphere he wanted. The fuzz in this album relaxes you. Trust\ufeff in Varg's fuzz. \n\nMost importantly, give it time to grow on you.\n\noriginally posted on http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/\n",
        "\nWell, here comes the review for the release I've been waiting for since, well, a while now. I refused to download the album, so I waited until I had the opportunity to buy it. \n\nThe production quality, as always, isn't quite polished, but its not terrible though. It's perfectly balanced, and it makes each instrument sort of blend together AND stand out in their own unique way. The riffs are great, and the drums are pretty good too. They definitely add to the atmosphere, and thats what Burzum is usually about anyhow. The only problem was that on the older tracks (some of these songs are from 1993!) the bass was inaudible. Now, is bass is inaudible, thats a problem for me, because I love bass as equally, if not more so, than guitar. It truly is the more beautiful instrument. But, I digress. The album is everything I expected. It's long, it's atmospheric, it's wondrous. Only one problem...\n\nIt's TOO damned long, and too monotonous in some parts. Belus' Doed is a fairly interesting track, given the creepy funeral like riffs in the background and the drums. Add Varg's wolf-like howls on top, and its a perfect track. The album starts to drag on in Glemselens Elv is 11 and a half minutes long, of almost the same riff over and over again. The song is nice the first time around, by itself, but, with the whole album? No. The stand out song on this album, though, is Sverddans. It's a thrashy song with a double bass in the background and a fast paced tempo. It's quite nice, actually, I think. Kind of a break from the melancholic, droning riffs. The next few songs are the same melancholy though, but they are each unique and interesting in their own way. However, the most epic track on this whole album is Belus' Tilbakekomst (Belus' Resurrection). It's inspiring, and listening to it, you can imagine a great golden god rising from the ashes of death while listening to it. And the album ends.\n\nOverall, the album did drag on, but, for 20 years of absence (well, other than Daudi Baldrs and Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf) it's pretty damned good!\n",
        "\nListening to Belus, I discovered two pieces of news. The good: Burzum is still the undisputed vanguard of the second wave black metal sound. This is the best metal album of the decade. The second piece of news is bad only for every other band in the genre: the bar has been raised very high. Until Varg tops Belus with a forthcoming album or someone else does so in the near future, \"second wave-ish\" black metal ends here with this album. While I will stop just short of calling it a landmark record, Belus is however a unit of measure. A re-magnetized compass dial to re-orientate the genre onwards to the evolution of northern enlightenment after every two bit atmospheric bedroom band from the Cascades to the Balkans claim to shoot an azimuth through unchartered forests when they did little more than forage through a Cabela's showroom for inspiration. It's a vaccine against bands like Dimmu Borgir, Gorgoroth and Satyricon who have made an absolute mockery of Norwegian black metal by aspiring to Daddy Warbucks instead of pondering the Daudi Baldrs. You can call it whatever you want. Belus is a lot of things but more importantly it's a miracle offering. \n\nBelus by Burzum is diurnal black metal. Varg has created an album that correctly dispels the notion that nocturnal grimness, lunar visions and other cliches do not represent his idea of what black metal should be any longer. Obviously, other bands-some worthy- have centered their music on this premise as well so this is not a novel concept altogether. It's in Varg's musical execution of elliptical transcendence with his patented riffs where this album stands out. His Tolkien-ized rendering on the celebration of Baldr(Belus) in a woodland abode after all those years still makes even a most veteran practitioner of forest black metal (like Ildjarn) seem like a babe in the woods by comparison. I also can\u2019t help think that the themes are like the musical equivalent of Walden by Thoreau. The structure, harmonies and progressive feel are of that naturalist spirit. Personality-wise, I\u2019m sure Vikernes and Thoreau would hardly be inclined to sit across from each other for tea but the fervor for transcendence in the respective art forms prevails nonetheless. \n\nA very fascist sounding album this is too. It\u2019s beautiful. Now, what does a stereotypical taco eater from Arizona such as myself know about how \u201cfascist\u201d ambiance sounds like? Though I may not resemble the Elmer Fudd of his entourage to qualify to be Varg\u2019s lawn boy (except to only mow it like a good Mexican), I have a deep respect for this man\u2019s brilliance as a musician and storyteller. Nature is fascist. The fulgent beams of Baldr in his solar incarnation are fascist and burn down accordingly. Mr. Vikernes understands this well. That\u2019s what I hear as depicted when so many of the album\u2019s riffs show up. The structure is mesmerizing. The is repetition is hypnotic. The guitar on Belus D\u00f8d is strict in its tremolo riff arrangement. Sharp and to the point and there is not much change from Filosofem. When that song concludes, Glemselens Elv takes you on a path of even more relentless flow of nature\u2019s wrath and elongation. The title translates as \u201cThe River of Forgetfulness\u201d. Anything that gets caught in the current will succumb to oblivion no matter the season. The blast beats are vague and hidden underneath the low production sound. It reinforces the idea that every fallen man drowns as it moves. I again reiterate, the fascist vibe of this album is that of in the context of nature so in that respect there is an undeniable sadness to it. Burzum may have been the originator of this kind song but it still would not surprise me one bit if he one day heard Seven Tears Are Flowing to the River by Nargaroth and said to himself: \u201chmm..I\u2019m gonna show this hack who the real McCoy is.\u201d Kaimadalthas Nedstigning scorches you with a raw black metal attack of distorted arpeggios until it breaks into a straddling harmony where Varg repeats clean chants with an almost Orwellian incessancy. I know a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate a more conventional sounding black metal track like Sverddans disrupting the flow but I had no problem with it. I think it gives the album a center to offset a possible perceived excessive \u201cloftiness\u201d to the proceeding. The song reminded me of Black Metal War on Graveland\u2019s Thousand Swords for that very reason.\n\nHave you ever stood in the middle of a quiet forest valley or desert all by yourself and heard the heavy hooves of a large horse scrambling in your direction? That\u2019s the gist of track six but Keliohesten is no ordinary steed. The epic distortion to begin the song is intimidating along with the furious blast beats depicting the hustle of this immortal Norse horse. Baldr has descended into Hel on the title beast of burden. His travel and speed to such a place is furious and ungodly chaotic as the song conveys. His return is The Light. \n\nMy perception of the last two songs of Morgenr\u00f8de and Belus' Tilbakekomst alludes to more of that fascist feeling but even more intensely than any of the previous songs before. Most people can\u2019t describe what a bright ray of sunlight is actually composed of but they can tell you that it is densely packed and mercilessly oppressive when it is squarely shone directly on the face. Burzum is a band that creates metal to depict such classical images and feelings. These last two songs are conjoined. The riffs feel like the bombardment of rich morning solar rays drowning the face of a maimed warrior slowly dying in the middle of a forest from his wounds; delirium, disillusion but a somehow glorious pain; the constant ringing of the ears from the bombardment of that intense bright light. Take notice of the quivering bass line on Morgenr\u00f8de. The main guitar riffs on it depict the radiant rays bathing the forest. It sounds like Baldr coming to life by taking from the mortal. The length of the songs are perfect because they describe what a slow procession this is. Listen for how Varg\u2019s buzzing riffs on Belus' Tilbakekomst tend to fade back a couple points during the song. And then the ultra rich monotony of them reappear twice as loud. Listening to them full blast, the almost physical experience of all those solar particles come through in the medium of sound. As I said before: Diurnal black metal. \n\nBurzum is playing black metal again and the miracle offering is that the project has brought a much needed atmosphere of a bright shining light. Everything is in place. Other than fans of Burzum's own Filosofem record, I highly recommend Belus to those who enjoyed 'n Crugu Bradului, Autumn Aurora, Jahreszeiten or most anything by Hate Forest and Walknut.\n",
        "\nPerhaps at the time of Burzum\u2019s conception, the idea was unprecedented \u2013 its sincerity and simplicity harbored something unique and truly sole in its existence. Everyone knows fucking Burzum and everyone knows what Burzum sounds like. It was a project that embodied the epitome of music that is atmospheric, dark, misanthropic and distinctive. However, during the long years of Vikernes\u2019s incarceration, black metal almost immediately lost the very important tenet of being yourself, and as a result a whole bunch of unoriginal douchebags created the philosophy of \u201ctrue nekrogrim black metal\u201d to justify their derivative and bland ripping-off of the forefathers of said metal. Thus, a genre of music that was at a time unique and individualistic turned into unoriginal sheep-like wankery. Among other things, Burzum\u2019s formula of simplistic rawness was copied to no end. Of course, to combat this phenomenon, black metal had to reinvent itself and up the ante from time to time, earning the hatred of purists along the way.\n\nBut, Vikernes was locked up during this time period and was probably not very aware (or didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass) of what had transpired outside, and, while black metal evolved, Vikernes didn\u2019t. Belus is far from groundbreaking; it is just what could've been done long ago, it is like that unknown, never-heard before material recorded that graced someone's attic and just now was released, and everyone thinks - \"Oh, how ahead of its time this was!\" But, the time it would be ahead of is past. Belus is a modern release. It will not be granted that luxury.\n\nAs to the songs themselves, they almost always follow the strict pattern of playing repetitive riffing patterns to no end. While the melodies are interesting to say the least, they are just too worn out over the course of the songs and they fail to posit themselves as something extraordinary and unique. They\u2019ve already been done by a shitload of other bands, mostly copying the ideas of Burzum and the like. So, here we have a peculiar case where the freshness of the original has been diminished by its duplicates. I stopped listening to the album several times because the riffs can be so fucking tiresome. I cannot stress this enough \u2013 they\u2019re repetitive. They\u2019re so fucking repetitive that they become more uninteresting than whatever new theory Varg has on life, race, the universe and everything. At the same time, it seems Burzum has only evolved in partially doing away with the ambiance of the old records and this does not work well with the monotonous nature of the songs. If they're going to use cyclical songwriting, they should be atmospheric. If they lack atmosphere, they'll just end up being boring. With certain exceptions (Sverddans comes to mind), Belus cannot escape from the severe mid-tempo monotony. The vocal work is alright I guess, the clean parts sometimes making me want to punch Varg in the face, but nothing too unbearable. When it takes a break from being monotonous, the album does shine, but ultimately doesn't make it.\n\nI can see why this release will be well-accepted by Burzum fans and all those \u201ctrve\u201d black metallers. It is almost nostalgic and would\u2019ve been revolutionary fifteen fucking years ago. However, that time has long since passed and this sort of black metal has already been killed by over-saturation. This is hardly innovative or new, black metal has far surpassed Belus already. It came too late to be original.\n",
        "\nVarg Vikernes is without question the most controversial man in heavy metal, but despite being pre-judged by many as being violent and angry, his music in the band Burzum does not deal with the typical conventions of black metal, like Satanism and violence. His music can be thoughtful and metaphorical, and there's no better example of that than in Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. \n\nConsisting of only 4 songs, none of which are under 7 minutes, this album is seen by many as one of the best black metal albums ever made, and Varg Vikernes himself said it was the peak of Burzum's musical period. The best thing about this album comes in right off the bat: an atmospheric musical soundscape that he has never matched before or since. There was little to no atmosphere in the debut album (although the cold, sharp riffs and general dark feeling made up for that), Det Som Engang Var had some atmosphere, but this album I can just really sink into, and feel the music more than any other Burzum release. Keyboards are much more present in this album, than in the past ones, becuase they are used in songs outside of the ambient instrumentals. Varg uses them in every song except one to underline the music and carry it along and accompany the pounding exciting drums and speedy tremolo picked guitars. \n\nDet Som Engang Var is the first track, and it opens up with the keyboards moving along on their own, making a slow, drawn out melody with quiet guitars following along with it, and this is how the album builds atmosphere, and it does it really well. It almost feels like I'm being brought into the Theodor Kittelsen picture shown on the album artwork. Then the guitars come right out in the open with a highly memorable riff, and then the drums come pounding in, and I don't know if the drums sound the same on the CD as they do on the record that I have, but they sound incredible. Every drum Varg strikes resounds and can be heard in perfect clarity. The pattern of keyboards, drums and guitars continues until about 4 and a half minutes in, when those harsh, inhuman vocals start up. As most Burzum fans know, these vocals take quite a while to get used to, and I don't exactly blame people for not liking Varg's vocals. It took me quite a while to get used to them, and this is the song that got me used to them. To defend them though, although they deffinitely aren't talented from a technical point of view, it's that relentless emotion that comes from them that I love. That, and the power that they surge through the music. The song pounds, booms, and crashes, and it still gives in an interlude or two that take things slow and bring the keyboards back, giving the song a chance to breathe and develop atmospherically. Even though the song is an impressive 14 minutes, it doesn't ever feel long to me. Actually, the way I get into this song, I can't even keep track of time anymore. It's a really great song, one of Burzum's very best. \n\nThe next track is the title track, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, and to me, it's the only blemish on this record and is the only reason I didn't give this a 100%. Don't get me wrong, it's a good song like the others, but it doesn't meet the standard of the other songs by far. I always get into it when it starts, but as the song continues, I begin to get a little bored. Not really that much is going on in the song. It does have a much faster pace than the previous song, but it doesn't really take you anywhere like the other songs do. I did hear that Varg had recorded a song that he was going to use to replace the final track with called En Hvitt Lys Over Skogen, which I have heard before on a compilation of rare Burzum songs, but I think that En Hvitt Lys Over Skogen should have replaced this song instead. It fits better into the whole album and it's just a much better song in general. \n\nMoving on to another great one, Inn I Slottet Fra Dr\u00f8mmen. It starts with a simple crashing guitar riff and some skilled drumming that gets you pretty pumped. Varg's screams come in, and the heavy guitar riffs go along with everything in a much more melodious sense of aggression than the previous songs did. It's definitely much more exciting than the last song, and progresses quite a bit more too. The patterns change frequently enough to ensure that I stay with the atmosphere, and then my favorite part of the song comes in: 3:43 to the end of the song. The keyboards come in and join the guitars in a more progressive riff that just keeps leading you to different places in the music, and the song ends off on a highly headbangable riff at 5:35. The song has all the atmosphere and heaviness that the first track did, although it's concentrated into 7 minutes (the shortest song on the album). \n\nThe final song is Tomhet, and it ends the album on a prefect note. Another 14 minute song, with just as much atmosphere as all the other songs combined. It's an ambient instrumental consisting of only keyboards, but it invokes a hypnotic sense of calm. It really reflects this album's range and brings everything together for the album and completes it. It isn't nearly repetitive as the 25 minute ambient song from Filosofem, and it keeps you with the soothing atmosphere all the way through. It's a nice way to let you settle down and consider what you're hearing. It's an amazing song. (The video clip I put in with the review is the final 7 minutes of the song. You'll see what I mean when you hear it.) \n\nAll in all, the album is one of my absolute favorite albums I've heard so far in my life. It has a dense atmosphere that doesn't let up and really reflects what Burzum's music is like: thoughtful and atmospheric. This is Varg at his best, and if you're a fan of Burzum or black metal and you can tolerate the vocals, don't let this release pass you by. It really is astounding.\n",
        "\nThis is an album review, not a history lesson, so I'll do just that, REVIEW THE ALBUM! \n\nFirstly, this album is not some magic, amazing new style pulled out of vargs arse, but it certainly does contain a fresh progression of his style of music. It seems a lot of people have found the tracks Belus Doed and Glemselens Elv to be \"old style Burzum\" and therefore not worthy. In my opinion, this couldn't be further from the truth. While it is similar to \"old style Burzum\", this certainly doesn't make it any less worthy. I think they are the best two songs on the album, and not only that, but by a long shot. This is classic Burzum executed brilliantly, and hey, I'm a Burzum fan so why would I be complaining? 15 years is a long time to listen to four quality albums. You find yourself wishing there was more of this, and Belus delivers. \n\nKaimadalthas Nedstigning is often referred to as the standout track. It is different in style to his previous work definitely, but while the main riff is quite \"panicy\" and chaotic, it lacks the melancholy and despair of what I believe to be his best stuff. Then it goes into a clean vocal chant over a tremolo picked guitar and a single 1, 2, 3, 4 kick drum beat. I find it incredibly annoying and I always skip this track. It lacks all the emotional quality that I love, and the image of a hideous Ork in a cave making music is gone and it sounds like a guy in a recording studio.\n\nIn brief, Sverddans is thrashy, pretty good. Keilohesten is more fast paced black metal, and very good. \n\nMorgenroede is a nice song. Different enough to please the bored, and filled with emotion to please sensitive types like me (for music soothes even the savage beast!). The second half of the song utilizes a quite melancholic quiet riff with an unusual drum machine beat to accompany it. It actually works quite well and, I must say, the diversity it creates for the album is great. The final song, Belus' Tilbakekomst (Konklusjon) is a continuation of Morgenroede, but it's fairly boring and a bit flat, reminding me of the Gebrechlichkeit songs from Filisofem. If you like that style of song you might like it but I don't so ha!\n\nAnd the Vocals: Vargs vocals aren't his usual unique shrieks that I love so much, and I find they are sorely missed. He instead goes with a more typical style black metal growl, which isn't bad but it's like going back to condoms when you've been doing bareback. \n\nFinally, the production: I don't love it, but I don't hate it. This is his first digital studio album as all his previous releases were analogue. I wish he went with analogue, because Belus is a bit thin and airy. I love a bit of filth to an album and it's needed for the bleak atmosphere of Burzum's music. Belus is still cold as ever though and it isn't by any means a Nuclear Blast style production at all (THANK ODIN!!). \n\nSo for the few songs I think are annoying and boring, and the \"meh\" ok production and vocals, I have deducted points. But for brilliant tracks like the ones I mentioned I definitely think this album is a MUST for Burzum fans. If you don't like old Burzum, then why bother in the first place?\n",
        "\nAfter more than a decade, we now have a real Burzum album for our ears. I could also say that it is \"burzumic\". As usual, the production is quite poor, but compared to his other recordings, I could say that this has the best production. I could say that Varg did an excellent job on the vocals. It's tighter than ever, and also a little bit deeper, which made me like it. Two thumbs up for that. He also used his clean vocals for the very first time. The vocals have a lot of emotion in it. I think it is because of the lyrics being in Norwegian, his native tongue. The only problem I saw on the production are the drums which is quite soft to be heard and is overshadowed by the guitars.\n\nThe songs are still the same: minimalistic and hypnotizing. Parts getting repeated over and over again really puts you in the music. The length of the slow songs made me feel three things: amazement for being majestic, calmness for the sense of tranquility, and at the same time, some boredom for the extensive length. I still believe though, that the album can't be complete without those songs. Those songs gave me the feeling of death and glory. What I really liked here are the fast-paced tracks (tracks 3-6), which showcases the brutality of true Norwegian black metal. Those three tracks made me bang my head like hell. The fourth track, \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\", has something catchy in it, which I like and at the same time, get annoyed at. For short, it amazes me that even after more than a decade of prison, he is still capable of real black metal.\n\nOverall, this is true Norwegian black metal. Although certain not to be an instant classic, it will be over time. Varg just proved in this album that true Norwegian black metal is still alive and well. Take a listen if you want true Norwegian black metal and be amazed!\n\nOriginally made for http://mystifymyserie.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nOh boy where to start with this one...since it was announced last year that following his 16-year spell in prison Varg Vikernes was going to be releasing a new album under the Burzum name, and a 'metal' one at that too, I have found myself eagerly anticipating it's arrival, keen to know how someone who has spent so long behind bars will adjust to the vastly different scene to what he was last exposed to. Much like a new release from Slayer or Metallica always does, it is often difficult to see through the hype and speculation with such anticipated releases and \"Belus\" has been no exception, everyone with a mouth keen to air their views on a man who is by some distance the most controversial man in the history of that most controversial of music genres, metal.\n\nI never did quite 'get' Varg's two fully-synthesised albums, \"Dau\u00f0i Baldrs\" and \"Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf\", so the near-immediate introduction of his perennially grim guitar tone in a haze of feedback and darkness in \"Belus D\u00f8d\" is a most welcome one. Having read recent interviews with the man in which he declares a complete disinterest in (black) metal, (apparently not listening to a single BM record since 1996), it would've been mighty foolish to expect his sounds to be even the remotest bit modern and as such anyone turned away by the bleakness of classic records \"Filosofem\" and \"Det Som Engag Var\" will be just as offended by the mix of \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\", probably the best song on the album. The archetype repetitiveness that was the keystone of Burzum's earlier works is again at the heart of \"Belus\", with riffs and drum patterns ignoring conventional song structures to plug away seemingly endlessly to form a number of songs that though simple in nature require a few listens to fully become immersed in, before even then still being puzzled as to their effectiveness and worth.\n\nUnlike the old metal Burzum works, which often relied upon glacially slow ambient passages segueing into mid-paced black metal hammering for significant portions of their time, \"Belus\" does away with the pure ambient and has replaced it with a number of moments that are close to being the fastest Burzum has ever offered us. The 2-and-a-half minute \"Sverddans\" is effectively a grimly played and produced thrash metal number, replete with dodgy soloing, while \"Keliohosten\" and \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\" are no slouches either, utilising a more varied vocal performance from Varg, which, sadly, never reaches the unsettling demonic howl which graced the earlier works. Nine-minute closer \"Belus' Tilbakekomst (Konklusjon)\" is the closest that \"Belus\" comes to a passage of ambience; more relaxed in nature than any other song it is still however led by guitar and repetitive drum beat in an interesting, if not wholly effective song.\n\nGiven Vikernes' separation from the metal world there did exist the small potential for \"Belus\" to be another classic in waiting, steeped in Norwegian BM history and early 90's aura, but the spark that lit works like \"Filosofem\" is absent through the less densely constructed songs to be found here. Depending on which way you like at it you'll either be chuffed or disgusted that Varg has recorded an album that sounds like it could be from the glory days of early '90s Norwegian BM, but separating the man from the band is clearly not possible. This is how Varg Vikernes sounds in music, and frankly it's a wonder it's reached this level at all. \"Belus\" is not perfect but it is certainly worthy of standing amongst the indisputable classics that are often forgotten about when discussing the band known as Burzum. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nI thought giving myself a month to listen to Burzum\u2019s new record, entitled \u2018Belus\u2019, would be a smart move and a sufficient amount of time to become accustomed to the new ways of the twisted mind of Varg Vikernes. That is, if he had indeed adopted new techniques with which to pursue his career in the modern day. I was gravely wrong and had misjudged the amount of time that it would take to adjust to the new sound of Burzum. In fact, as time has gone by, I have found it even more difficult to muster any up sort of cohesion or coherence in my opinions in regards to the new material. I\u2019m sure the majority of the metal world knows by now that Varg has been released from prison and has indeed already released a new record to once again garner support for his musical expressions of the darkness that surrounds our daily lives, despair that tears us apart and the mythological interest that seems to have a great bearing on Varg\u2019s personal life, particularly when it comes to his art, both in the form of music and literature. \n\nHaving listened to \u2018Belus\u2019 almost every day since its release, I must admit that it is definitely what most people refer to as a \u201cgrower\u201d. This record leeches off its listener and imbeds its ideas and mesmerising sound into the individuals brain with its longevity. This record definitely serves up a number of qualities which have proved to be a hit for Varg in his earlier discography, particularly with the likes of \u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019 and \u2018Filosofem\u2019, my two favourites from his career. Having skim read through an interview or two on Varg\u2019s own personal take on his direction with \u2018Belus\u2019, I had already expected a record that wouldn\u2019t deviate much from the one\u2019s which established him in the first place and this was a smart move on my part. If I had expected something different from one of black metal\u2019s first and finest sons, then I may have been disappointed, but with my knowledge of what he was aiming to achieve, I have found I have been able to appreciate what he has had to offer with \u2018Belus\u2019 more so than I might have if I shied away from the media interest surrounding his character.\n\nHe had stated this record would be like the one\u2019s that came before it, but with a few new touches here and there and that is precisely what \u2018Belus\u2019 is. For years people have raved about the \u201cBurzumic\u201d style being ripped off by other bands who were doing the same thing only after Varg himself. To me, this seemed like a cry for black metal musicians to do something different, something unique with the genre and to leave the 1990\u2019s where it belonged - firmly in the past. With that in mind, unfortunately, \u2018Belus\u2019 doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of a new direction that Varg hasn\u2019t already explored years previous to its release. Parts of the record and songs in particular, especially those like \u2018Belus' Doed\u2019 are almost carbon copies of songs he produced many, many years ago on records like the aforementioned two and perhaps some of his earliest records like the self-titled one, \u2018Det Som Engang Var\u2019 and perhaps even the \u2018Aske\u2019 EP of 1993.\n\nSongs like \u2018Belus' Doed\u2019 would fit perfectly onto older records which, to me, sort of makes them redundant in the modern day. I accept that Varg has his techniques and that he likes sticking to them, but when an artist begins to recycle a sound, then I have to wonder whether it\u2019s warranted anymore. I\u2019m leaning towards the conclusion of no, it isn\u2019t. Though songs like this do showcase the main ideas of the record in general, such as an emphasis on entrancing and repetitious music akin to that of the evil 1990\u2019s, a stage which allowed the genre to flourish and fluctuate into what it has become today, but it doesn\u2019t feel necessary when I consider some of the other songs which take precedence over this one, such as the infectious and bass orientated \u2018Morgenroede\u2019. However, though the instrumentation itself may point towards a comparison to the olden day material on \u2018Filosofem\u2019, in particular, there have been some alterations, as expected.\n\nIn an interview with Varg that I had read, he said that he had wanted to change his vocal style, which he mostly certainly has done. His rasps, or shrieks have altered, but not only that, he has taken inventive measures on \u2018Belus\u2019 by supplying an unforeseen use of clean, mesmerising vocals which work particularly well against the backdrop of the instrumentation, which is also mesmerising in approach due to the repetitious stylistic methods and dense production. The production is actually an element which seems to have been called into question with numerous people speaking out about their hatred of it. It isn\u2019t as clean, no, but I think it perfectly suit\u2019s the style of the record and the elongated feel of the atmospheres which stretch into infinity, folding over onto itself and taking on a thick formation which gives the overall sound a real feeling of power and prowess. Although the production feels somewhat dirtier than usual, I actually think it sounds oddly more mature than previous, which works well with the vocal change, particularly when it comes to Varg\u2019s new distorted vocals.\n\nThough I consider them somewhat less agreeable than his previous style, they work well given the alterations. If they were placed onto a record like \u2018Filosofem\u2019, then they wouldn\u2019t suit the biting style of the distortion and production, but in this environment, they begin to flourish alongside reinvigorated elements like the bass, which is prominent on songs like the expansive \u2018Glemselens Elv\u2019. Although there hasn\u2019t been much of a change when it comes to Varg\u2019s song writing, he still has the capabilities to produce some top drawer moments on songs like \u2018Glemselens Elv\u2019, which place an emphasis on mind altering riffs and entrancing riffs. Songs like \u2018Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\u2019 instead opt for the same infectious sound through the use of cleanly spoken vocals which, again, shows an increased sense of invention by Varg, who did state that this is precisely how he always wanted to sing, but didn\u2019t know how to go about doing it. Having spotted several positive traits in \u2018Belus\u2019, a song like \u2018Sverddans\u2019 comes along and once again places a grain of doubt in my mind over Varg\u2019s presence in today\u2019s black metal scene. \n\nSongs like this wouldn\u2019t be out of place of his self-titled work, for example, and given my personal dislike of his earliest material, I wasn\u2019t at all pleased with this songs presence on the record. It gives \u2018Belus\u2019 a somewhat dated feel, as if, once again, he\u2019s simply recycling material which didn\u2019t have a place on older records, or demos. However, I can old school fan lapping this up given its conjuration of the early to mid-1990\u2019s emphasis on evil within black metal atmospherics. However, though this song serves only to grate on my nerves, the one\u2019s which follow it do leave me with a generally positive feel, especially \u2018Morgenroede\u2019, which reminds me of post-punk epics given the importance of the bass to the song and the instrumentation in general. The production, though it has a muggy feel, doesn\u2019t detract from the good work of the \u201csmaller\u201d elements of Burzum\u2019s style, like the bass and percussion aspects. Though these areas may not project themselves as explosively as the guitars, or distorted vocal range of Varg, they make me sit up and notice them more so than on previous occasions. I would certainly rate \u2018Belus\u2019 amongst Varg\u2019s better records, though I feel nothing can topple the mighty \u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019, but it certainly whitewashes over his prison works, which were awful, and his earlier records which I have never come to appreciate as classics.\n",
        "\nBurzum has always represented a divergent path in the Norwegian scene, and there is pretty much no clearer of an example of this than Varg\u2019s own offering to the 1994 climax of the early 90s in \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d. While most offerings either took the path of extreme vileness (Gorgoroth and Mayhem) or some variant of an epic and majestic atmosphere (Emperor and Enslaved), this album subsumes both of those ideas in very limited amounts under an overriding feeling of sorrow. This could be ascertained by the visual of a corpse laying at the side of a path in the woods as depicted on the album art, but even without the visual aid, the auditory craftsmanship is so obvious on each musical chapter that a similar image of archaic woe and remembered grief leaps right out at whoever has ears to hear.\n\nLike any of Burzum offerings, the stylistic approach to the black metal paradigm relies heavily on atmospheric elements and droning riff work. The songs are all epic in scope, though in overall musical content there is about as much variation as one might expect from a 3 to 4 minute song. But where this one differs is that the combination of a larger sounding production and a solid, pounding guitar tone unleashes a furious wave of agony that rivals anything yet conceived by any metal outfit. The formula that has been resorted to on previous albums is mostly maintained, but in a more ambitious and concentrated form. It comes off as less raw overall, although the depressed and morose vocal wails are equally as telling of a gutted soul, writhing in eternal pain, as they\u2019ve ever been. \n\nUpon entering the opening seconds of \u201cDet Som En Gang Var\u201d, the principle image that emerges is that of a grand castle gate opening. At first sight, the atmosphere is melancholy, almost akin to a funeral for an unnamed, benevolent monarch. What follows the initial 3 minute intro is a completely new theme that is somewhat more chaotic in nature, but generally maintains the overall ambient aesthetic established from the beginning. The guitars generally have a hazy nature to them, although at times they border on a proto-thrash character not all that far removed from early Venom. Varg\u2019s contorted wails pipe in and out in rather abrupt intervals, short in length, and sparsely placed, almost as if seeking to act as a final detailing on a simply designed tapestry. Things generally progress slowly, as a third contrasting theme enters about 5 minutes after the previous one began, though a restatement of the 2nd theme appears in a lead guitar line that sounds heavily influenced by Depeche Mode pipes in to offer a slight variation. One could note a peculiar paradox of a song that is over 14 minutes long and pretty much among the more complex things that Varg has ever created being set around a set of lyrics, in free verse form, that could be read in under 15 seconds yet inspire a much longer period of contemplation. But this sort of a programmatic approach to songwriting is a familiar trait in Burzum\u2019s style, and easily identified with a number of conceptual works by various metal and non-metal writers.\n\nAfter the massive opening chapter to the intricately simple book that is \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d ends, things take on a slightly more conventional character. The album\u2019s title song continues on a similar line as the 3rd section of the previous song, but presents it in a heavier tone, as the keyboards move down to the bottom of the arrangement, and the rhythmic drive lends itself to a blackened thrash character. This is the sort of droning yet driving song that Darkthrone was probably going for on \u201cTransylvanian Hunger\u201d, but didn\u2019t quite live up to due to a less nuanced approach to sectional development and a barer atmosphere. \u201cInn I Slottet Fra Droemmen\u201d follows a similar driving approach, but doesn\u2019t quite qualify as a droning song as it switches around much more frequently. The melodic ideas shift in and out, keyboards come and go, and in much the same nature as a bizarre dream, it changes in such abrupt ways that it shocks the senses. A loose yet fitting analogy could be made to Enslaved\u2019s early works here insofar as ambitiousness is concerned, although the technical chops of said band are exchanged here for a plurality of excellent ideas that are heavily distinctive, yet blend together perfectly without throwing off the continuity of the whole.\n\nAlthough the general theme presented throughout the album has been a middle ground between reminiscence and dreams, \u201cTomhet\u201d (which translates into \u201cEmptiness\u201d, a fitting title) strips away the sorrowful remembrances and nightmares until all that remains is the bare essence of consciousness. Like his other ambient works, the atmosphere puts things into a state of a wakened sleep, as 3 distinct ambient lines enter one at a time, and interact with each other. The melodic voice in the first section carries a theme that is heavily similar to the one that accompanied the distorted funeral march at the beginning of \u201cDet Som En Gang Var\u201d, but the presentation of the whole reveals pristine landscapes in a nebulous manner rather than a woeful procession. At about halfway through its 14 minute duration, the sounds compress into a smaller and quieter arrangement, yet begins to show signs of harmonic movement, as if pointing to something else to come. Sure enough, a beautiful flute melody accompanied by a distant sound of percussion emerges, like a lone piper playing to a quiet breeze at sunset. Although a bit more animated and compact than the ambient masterpiece heard on \u201cFilosofem\u201d, I tend to prefer that one to this, though only by a very small margin.\n\nUltimately, what is accomplished here is radically different from what became the dominant sound of the black metal genre. It is this difference in character alone that separates it from the blackened trinity of 1994 represented in \u201cPentagram\u201d, \u201cIn The Nightside Eclipse\u201d and \u201cVikingligr Veldi\u201d, though it definitely holds its own when compared to any of the three. Most who claim to be influenced by it, more so than with any of the emulators of other bands in the 2nd wave, can\u2019t help but fail to properly emulate Varg\u2019s distinctive melodic aesthetics or achieving the surreal atmosphere necessary to reel the listener in. My own preference to \u201cFilosofem\u201d over this one can only be explained as a matter of preference. Both are equally astounding in their own way, and are equally essential to anyone who wishes to become versed in black metal as an art form.\n",
        "\nThe first song makes it seem like the last 15 years of black metal never happened (if only!)--could be an outtake from his last pre-incarceration album, Filosofem. And that's... ok. But I think we all really don't JUST want Burzum to be a Burzum clone. And the album really does open out to be much more than that. But what does it add up to? We want something game-changing. We waited long enough.\n\nAs the album unfolds, it is apparent that it is NOT game-changing... but then you realize, if we \"really knew\" what it took to be game-changing, then that would just be an exercise of will. To set out to reinvent everything about music--lots of artists try this, and the history of metal especially is strewn with the failures (Into the Pandemonium) that result. There are very few successes: Bathory's Hammerheart comes to mind as one the great mid-career paradigm shift.\n\nBelus is not so drastically different from earlier Burzum... but it is RADICALLY, shockingly different from the black metal of the last 15 years. The album screams, \"You guys got it all wrong!\"--and I am completely persuaded. Xasthur, Leviathan, Krieg, Velvet Cocoon, Nachtmystium, Wolves in the Throne Room, and legions of more obscure one-man \"Burzum-influenced\" bands--- all of this seems completely beside the point now.\n\nHowever, this would not be the case if Belus JUST sounded like Filosofem. It is better than that album, which was limited by its high concept. Belus is, in a way, the definitive Burzum album---but to understand that statement is not to limit Burzum to a mere style. What makes this record is what makes any record: a great number of \"neat parts\" and compelling riffs. But what makes this album \"journalistically\" interesting is that it has *zero* attachment to black metal's trappings... and yet... sounds completely like Burzum. Seemingly we missed the point the first go-round.\n\nBlack metal since Burzum's last album has consistently tried to \"cheat\" and produce the style and dubious \"kvlt\" attitude of a perceived original scene. The most successful bands were the most eccentric--Vlad Tepes, Sacramentary Abolishment, later Graveland, Bone Awl--and eventually not a single person living will care about most of the last decade's basement black metal. But what we learn here is that Burzum maybe ought never to have had ANYTHING to do with all that in the first place.\n\nThere is a lot of beautiful music here to lose yourself in. \n\nBest songs: \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning,\" \"Sverddans,\" \"Keliohesten,\" \"Morgenroede.\" (tracks #4-7)\n",
        "\nBurzum is a band I\u2019ve been a fan of since 1992, and for true black metal music Varg Vikernes is one of the absolute founders of the Norwegian scene, despite many opinions to the contrary. His line of music is one that has seen many changes, both radical and subtle, and all of them have garnered him many fans and criticisms. Some true black metal fans don\u2019t like the progression from Hyis Lyset tar Oss to Filosofem, thinking the more culturally-inspired work not \u201ckult\u201d enough. I suppose, in essence, you either get Burzum or you don\u2019t, and some people cannot adapt to change. \n\nBelus is the first full-length Burzum release in 11-years, and while the elements of black metal are still intertwined within the music, the cultural aspect is richer than ever. Where once you could put on the Aske EP and drive through a snowstorm at night and try hard to imagine yourself on the frozen roads of a Norwegian hillside, this album digs deeper into the roots of Vikernes\u2019 Norwegian heritage. Originally titled \u201cWhite God,\u201d the album centers around the mythology of Belus, the deity of light, and while all of the lyrics are in Vikernes\u2019 native tongue, the music surely transcends the limitations therein. \n\nAs opposed to a typical fanboy espousing the merits and wonders of Burzum, I\u2019d rather cast a very neutral light on what I\u2019m hearing in this CD after one initial listen. I\u2019d say the CD might resonate longer after a second or third hearing, but it is certainly interesting. I\u2019ve managed to stay away from most of the initial banter abound on the \u2018net about the album, but one or two blurbs I did catch noted disappointment at it not being another Det som Engang Var, which is inherently silly. Vikernes was still a kid when those albums were made, and while those albums are still viable and very good, he is a man nearing 40 and is more concerned these days with his Scandinavian topics as opposed to the satanic. As for the actual vocals on this CD, I must say they are a pleasant surprise. The vocals of his earlier releases were more in tune with someone stepping on tacks and attempting to sing. I can muster through them, but they are a tough go for me some 18-years later. These vocals are a raspy, very \u201ctypical\u201d delivery, but a step in the right direction. I\u2019m sure many people might also feel that the change to the typical vocalization of most black metal bands is conforming rather than separating from the masses, but the music and vocals are a nice partnership. \n\nVikernes managed all of the instruments on this release as he has with all of the others (save for Samoth\u2019s contribution on the Aske EP), and he is a firm believer in the \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d adage. Overall, I think he\u2019s more than competent in the musician area, without question. The Belus music is good metal music, but far from perfect or original. It\u2019s a very nice compliment to the Burzum mythos, albeit a rather obvious one. \n\nI can listen to this CD again and enjoy it, possibly more than the first go-round, but if you\u2019re anticipating a follow-up to 1993 you might well be disappointed. Fans of Filosofem and Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf will really enjoy this release. Fans of the atmospheric metal will also certainly get into this. While not too far from the black metal beginnings, the Belus offering is a audible trip to one man\u2019s tribute to the light. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nIntroducing the most anticipated Black Metal release of the millennium. Imprisoned for murdering Mayhem guitarist Euronymous, Varg \"Count Grishnackh\" Vikernes is now free to take his infamous musical legacy to magnificent new heights. With a back catalogue widely regarded as the best albums in Black Metal, \"Belus\" proves that Varg's talents as a songwriter never faded after all these years.\n\nAs for the controversy, it's best to treat Burzum and Varg's crimes and writings as separate. He himself assured that the band stands only for music and not the right-wing extremism of his published views. A recent interview states, \"if those who are not like me are able to enjoy my music that is all fine by me. Be a Christian-born black gay feminist converted to Judaism for all I care, or worse, a Muslim. Just stay off my lawn.\"\n\n\"Belus\" is an all-Norwegian concept album centered on its eponymous solar deity, whose familiar manifestations include Baldr and Apollo. The introductory track \"Leukes Renkespill\" chimes in with the hammer and anvil of the Loki, a.k.a. Hephaistos, stressing the common ancestry of Indo-European mythologies. \n\nThe first real song, \"Belus' D\u00f8d,\" is a sinister march into the past, right back to early 90's Norway. In fact it would fit perfectly on his second album \"Det Som Engang Var,\" though with tremolo harmonies that bring \"Filosofem\" to mind. On the one hand this is classic Burzum, with simple drumbeats and signature melodies. On the other hand, it\u201as immediately evident that Varg's prowess as a guitarist has not only survived prison, but has also taken a quantum leap. \n\nVocal-wise, Varg's still got it, though his trademark screams have matured into an echoing shriek that suits the warmer, but still raw-as-hell production, likely due to the use of digital and no longer analog equipment. At parts, he seems in dialogue with himself with clean-sung chants and an incredibly effective use of spoken word verses, which often introduce new themes within songs. For example, \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\" oscillates between an angry blast-beat riff and a chanted refrain before launching into perhaps the most majestic moment on the album, where Varg's guitar work shines brightest.\n\n\"Glemselens Elv\" may be the most beautiful Burzum song ever written, with a melody guaranteed to make you sway to and fro in a meditative trance. All the while tremolo riffs float above the rhythm in perfect harmony. It clocks in at eleven minutes, one for every year since we've gotten a release from this stellar songwriter.\n\nThis mastery should be noted in the album's perfect structure, which with each song increases the tempo, peaks at \"Sverddans\" (featuring an old school guitar solo), then decreases till by the final song the drums have simply melted away. \n\nA key feature of the early 90's albums was the presence of ambient tracks, here absent. This is well forgiven by the fact that his prison term gave us two full electronic albums in the form of \"Daudi Baldrs\" and \"Hlildskj\u00e1lf.\" \n\nIn short, this is not your typical comeback album. This is the product of a decade-and-a-half of refinement and meditation, and we all knew it would come one day. So here it is, a landmark release that should set the standard for extreme metal in the new decade.\n",
        "\nBurzum's \"Belus\" album shocked more than a few, some expected a dismal album of uninspired music from a former musician, who had created a specialized style of black metal that was based on lingering, ringing chords, punk riffing, and ethereal melodies. Other, I assume, would expect the album that would change their lives, the power of the music overtaking them--they had waited so long for the return of Burzum. \n\nPredictably, this album doesn't really pacify either category, the naysayer nor the sycophant. After a strange intro that sounds like a paint can being shaken before use, we are offered the return of Varg Vikernes via the track \"Belus' Doed.\" In an interesting gesture from the black metal star, we are introduced to a return to form, executed with intent. The intent? To recapture early glories, of course! The track more than resembles the track \"Jesus' Tod\" from Filosofem, but with a mature and more polished studio sound. Be sure of one thing, the old man's riffing hand is more precise than ever. \n\nRecorded in Grieghallen Studios, the sound is professional and studied, yet the production is tame. There are no unexpected elements for the most part, which is a rather large detriment to this release. The album moves along with nice sounding greyscale black metal. It's not too raw, it's not fragile in any way, nor does it wield a fury. However, the songwriting in Buzum maintains the touchstone melody and thought provoking chord progressions and meditative aspects. That being said, there isn't any poor tracks on this release, and yet there are no exceptional creations either. The signature repetition is there, along with a nicely added pagan \"sung\" vocal addition on some tracks (\"Glemselens Elv\"). \n\nOne facet of this release which does not cheapen it, that also would have been very easy and timely to co-opt, is the complete lack of \"atmospheric\" black metal ponderousness. This is the style of black metal cheapened, used, and abused by pot-smoking Californian black metal fan-boys like Xasthur and Wolves in the Throne Room. It was heartening to hear a more aggressive and speedy take on black metal riffing, a no frills and no delay effects approach. As the essential innovator behind that more ethereal, ghostly and epic ballad style of metal, this Burzum release could just have just as easily tried to \"cash in\" on the success of this trend. \n\nInstead, this Buzum album goes along well with the current batch of songs churned out by the re-vitalized Gorgoroth, lead once again by Infernus. \"Sverddans\" displays a thrash metal fetish that must still be buried in the mind and flowing in the blood of the creator. Nearing the end of the album, \"Keliohesten\" is another subtle, minimal, quietly raging track of trance-like repetitiveness with some \"call to arms\" riffing that eludes to the charge at the onset of battle.\n\nMuch of this album is status quo for a Burzum release, but there are a few mild surprises. There are a few interesting twists added on this release. Earlier in the album there is a repeated sample employed during \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\" which lends the track a gothic, 80's appeal. Interesting sounding, and yet kind of funny, the track \"Morgenroede\" features verse music that employs what I could only refer to as an 80's 808 bass beat groove similar to those employed in explicit miami bass rap music. Considering that this is Buzum, once you consider this the track is kind of hilarious. Despite this, the track succeeds, as the bass flourish is, lke the album as a whole, under-stated. In the end I believe that the album works because everything is understated, it's a minor flaw, but if the ideas were presented in a more gratuitous or overwhelming manner, the album could have failed under that additional weight.\n\nOverall, this is a very listenable, albeit uneventful Buzum album which proves that Vikernes still has strong songwriting skills, mastery of his chosen instrument, and, now, a lot of money as well. He has aged gracefully.\n",
        "\nAfter over a decade when Varg Vikernes was in jail and released just two all-synthesiser albums under the Burzum name as part of an intended trilogy and which attracted poor reviews and much criticism, I confess my expectations for \"Belus\" were not high. I was prepared to give Burzum another chance since the earlier recordings that I know have been good. Fortunately \"Belus\" turns out to fall into that category too: it's not up to the level of \"Filosofem\" and \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" in originality and emotional intensity but it's nowhere near as ghastly as \"Hlidskjalf\", one of the all-synth albums in the failed trilogy. All the same, \"Belus\" is inconsistent musically over eight songs and unless listeners know something of the lyrical theme that binds the whole album together, they are likely to be confused as to what Vikernes wants to be or is trying to achieve with his songs. (Astute MA readers will notice I didn't mention the \"Daudi Baldrs\" album but at this time of writing I had not heard the album. Being the kind of curious dumbo that I am, it's perhaps a wonder that I've not heard it yet. I understand I may not be missing anything much.)\n\nThe early songs in \"Belus\" sound very like part 2 of \"Filosofem\" in their repetitive minimal structures and their dominant guitar melodies and riffs. These have the same flowing quality and could almost be variations of the tunes on \"Filosofem\". What's different about these is their sound - it's a lot deeper and stronger, not so thin, and perhaps this is the sound Burzum was seeking for \"Filosofem\" before jail-time came between him and the album. The vocals are upfront and much more confident, and on quite a few songs on \"Belus\", black metal vocals and clean-toned vocals, spoken and sung, alternate as though Vikernes was engaged in a dialogue with himself or an imagined second person. The vocals often carry anger or some other emotion like resignation or indifference while more intense and complex emotions are carried by the guitar riffs and the drum rhythms - check out the half-happy / half-bitter ambience of the guitar passage in \"Kaimadalthas Nedstigning\". But apart from the technical details of Burzum's updated sound, there isn't much new or different from previous Burzum work in the first half of the album.\n\nThere is a short phase (tracks 5 and 6) of tight punchy aggressive melodic metal in the middle of \"Belus\" which is sure to go down well with a lot of listeners. The drumming rhythms are tight and fast and are like death metal rhythms. Vikernes scrabbles a lot with the fast guitar melodies but the structure of the songs being limited to repeated riffs, neither of them really goes anywhere, there's no climax or resolution to the quick build-up of tension and anger, and the songs end as suddenly as they begin. \n\nThe last two tracks are something completely different: they're very noisy and loose, they have a melancholic and definite black metal feel, and they verge on experimentation with sound, mood and energy. The guitars are so bleedingly raw in their tones that they acquire a hellish sound though embedded within is an electric sparkle. The constant repetition ends up reverberating in your head. In the very last track, drums fall away so it is all just ongoing relentless repetition of trilling guitar notes surging onwards and never seeming to end. The guitar seems to acquire a life-force that is all sheer energy.\n\nThe themes of isolation, dread and melancholy that were present on \"Hvis Lyset ...\" and \"Filosofem\" and which made those albums very intense emotionally haven't carried over to \"Belus\". Instead we have a theme of a god who descends to the underworld and comes back to ours though what the god returns with and how the experience makes the god a better or worse ... um, entity, I suppose, isn't revealed. Even if the god learns no useful lessons or has no new understanding and insights into his character, he could have had some effect on the underworld and the interaction between the two might have made for an interesting experience involving some emotional intensity: the god could have met an underworld friend but this being might not be able to leave the place or can leave only if the god meets certain conditions which he fails to do. I can see the parallel between this theme of descent into the underworld and rebirth - it's a theme that appears in ancient Germanic and Slavic religions - and Vikernes's recent personal history so there was plenty of opportunity and potential to personalise that myth of descent / ascent and to bring out the emotions inherent in that myth: the sense of struggle, coping with failure and despair, wondering what's happening in the outside world, will the rules change and I'm stuck here forever, the mixed feelings that come when you're on the rise (will I keep going up and up? am I being set up? if I get out, how will I cope?) and the exhilaration that comes when finally you're back out in the sunlight. Somehow though in the early half of \"Belus\", we get little sense of the despair and hopelessness that Vikernes might have experienced when he first went to prison. In tracks 5 and 6, the anger and determination start coming through but if fear and hope had been mixed through these emotions as well, the intensity that could have resulted might have made the songs more interesting.\n\nIn some tracks there is potential for the music to go off in a different direction or undergo a change or variation that might lift it in style or mood, and Vikernes is capable of throwing pleasant surprises as in the song \"Kaimadalthas Nedstigning\" where he struck out at a tangent in the instrumental section so why he didn't do the same for other songs, especially in tracks 5 and 6 which need a tension release to represent death or the end of struggle, is a puzzle. I can understand tracks 7 and 8 being loose and almost experimental in the context of the theme as they represent the god acquiring on new life. So there isn't a lot in \"Belus\" that will hold listeners spellbound all the way through. It's likely that parts of the album will appeal to some people and other parts to others but there may not be many who will like everything equally.\n\nAs he wasn't all that active musically while he was in jail, I'm inclined to look kindly on Vikernes for backtracking to where he left off and to carry over the better aspects of the Burzum project as it was in the late 1990s but I'm disappointed that his music hasn't changed much in style, structure or themes during the time he spent in prison, and even with what he has, he doesn't extend his range to the utmost. I'm aware he spent most of his jail-time on self-education and other non-musical activities which might be assumed to have influenced his music. It seems Vikernes's experience of prison - I hear it was fairly benign - didn't have much positive effect on his musical development which may be kind of ironic for those MA readers in countries where being in prison means being tortured physically, mentally and spiritually, and never having a hope of ever being released or seeing your loved ones ever again.\n",
        "\nAfter a decade of absence, Burzum returns with a poppier, simpler, droning form that loses the sense of transcendence that made earlier Burzum great. It falls short of the past because unlike past albums, this new Burzum is designed to mimick the past successes of Burzum and others, as if the album were a means to an end like profit or notoriety.\n\nInfluences from the Slavic black metal scene are immediately apparent; the riffs are radically simplified and the song structures have reverted to a primitive A-B-A pattern. A dominant theme is introduced and then cycles with small changes being added sequentially, then there's a kind of extended bridge, and then we're back where we started. Where previous riffs were arranged melodically, this album is composed harmonically, with progressions set up to suggest a basic chord and then embellishment occurring in the spaces between notes. There's more dynamic energy in the fills than in the riffs themselves.\n\nAt least two songs sound like they are pre-Burzum. \"Svarddans\" could be lifted from Terrorizer's \"Fear of Napalm,\" and seems incomplete, in that a main riff cycle diverts into a strange interlude and then returns as if two songs were pasted together. \"Kaimadalthas' Nedstigning\" is a mishmash of influences from Destruction to Metallica in a big sloppy mess that has been stripped down and cleaned up here. Vikernes is of course at the height of his musical abilities, so he can make anything sound good, but the method of making \"anything\" sound good doesn't result in great songs -- only great interpretations of dumb songs.\n\nThe remaining songs have basic riffs without phrase, meaning that they are a series of chords on a relatively uniform pattern of rhythmic intervals, and between those chords the fills and embellishments give character and depth, then the chord progression periodically shifts its concluding note. Sound like anything you know? Yes, it resembles the \"black metal flavored\" indie rock of the Pacific Northwest, which combines well with the Drudkh-inspired droning ambient layers. As if to really make a hash of it, the band then injects Swedish melodic death metal touches to adorn the otherwise spare riffs.\n\nMost people will say this is not Burzum's best, but that it would be good for most bands. I'll go further and say that, like \"Divine Intervention\" or \"Slaughter of the Soul,\" this is a smart band dumbing down their material in order to guarantee a captive audience. It's like Burzum's version of the Metallica black album in that it's designed for a shorter attention span. So although it's better than most black metal, it loses what would make it a keeper for the next few decades, like the earlier Burzum albums were.\n",
        "\nWell, it\u2019s been 16 years and finally mister Kristian Vikernes is out of jail. Sure, since he\u2019s been locked up there has been metal Burzum material released, but it was all pre-recorded before he went to prison so it was all from the same stream of ideas. Then we had the atrociously cheesy, MIDI, Daudi Baulders and then the somewhat decent ambient album Hilksojef. I will save you some time and say, no, it\u2019s not AS good as Filsofem or Hvis, but this is still a great, great album and will be a classic in the future.\n\nThere was a growing fear amongst many people fear amongst fans that Burzum would never release more metal material whatsoever, (I remember reading a rumour that said he planned to release a House music album when he got out. I died a little inside when I read that) probably from some skewed, confusing interviews he did, and that metal Burzum was dead. But I am glad to tell you all that he has hardly abandoned black metal. In fact, this album is more metal then ambient in every way. In fact, it isn\u2019t the general style of ambient black metal at all.\n\nIf I were to best describe Belus, it would be that it is Burzums ambient work, but without the ambient synths. There is barely any synth work in here whatsoever, but the riffs are far more similar to that of Hvis lyst tar os and Filosofem, but there is some reverting to the Burzum/Aske album here as well. The album starts off with an opener that will remind anyone whose seen The Warriors of the famous bottle clanking seen, \"Warriors, come out to play,\u201d and then it\u2019s off to the first track, Belus' D\u00f8d. The track instantly reminds you of Filsofem and you soon anticipate the synths, but they never come. You listen track by track, getting the same crackled, mellow drummed, haunting Burzum you always remembered, yet different. \n\nVargs idea with this album was to tell the old legend of the death of the \u201cWhite God\u201d who may refer to many European deities such as Apollo, Belus, Baldr, Bragi and many more. It goes through his murder by another deity (in this particular case, Belus is killed by the god Leuke), his journey in the underworld and finally his rebirth. Fuck, if he didn\u2019t shank Oystein twenty-five times with a knife, you\u2019d think Varg was a harmless nerd...\n\nAnyway, so this is where the lyrical concept lies. Vargs lyrics have always been simple yet very poetic, generally not writing more than 20 lines, yet having the affect of 100 in terms of artistic value. This time, he has written full on narratives story for this album, making it a concept album. Now, I can\u2019t read Norwegian and there aren\u2019t any good translators online so I\u2019m going to go with a guess that they are probably pretty interesting.\n\nAs I said, this album holds more torches to DSEV/HLTO/Filo more than anything else, but there are a few tracks (such as 4 and 5) which feel a lot more like the chaotic, violent black metal that Burzum/Aske was; Blast beated, violent drumming with some thrash to the riffs bringing a first wave BM feel to Burzum that hasn\u2019t been felt since the latter mentioned album. Other than that, it\u2019s the mellow drummed, eerie, cold riffed work of ambient Burzum we all know and love as well.\n\nSomething that I will note as a HUGE improvement: the vocals. Now, I loved all of Burzums metal work, but I don\u2019t think there is a person out there who doesn\u2019t think Vargs vocals on those albums are some of the most god-awful, pain inducing sounds that one can\u2019t possibly fathom being produced by an animal of Earth. Sure, Filosofem saw him just putting distortion into his voice, but that\u2019s cheating. On Belus, it\u2019s apparent Varg has been practicing to improve himself because instead of sounding like a nails on a chalk board he sounds like a normal black metal vocalist. Some may say he\u2019s losing his indivuality, I say it\u2019s him not sounding like shit. Honestly, the dude should re-do his vocal tracks for ALL of his albums with his current vocal style.\n\nThe production style hasn\u2019t changed much. I think it\u2019s a little cleaner, but that may be due to the fact that it is way easier to do professional home recordings now a days and that you have to try in order to sound kvlt (which, admittedly he did do on filsofem by using a fuzz pedal and a TV as an amp and a head set as a mic). Another factor is that I think Varg was trying to make this a more mature album then previously, and was more focused on telling a musical story then being bad ass\n\nEven though he has left out his synths for this \u201cambient\u201d black metal album, it still very much feels like a Burzum album in all aspects. His work is something that has been copied but never truly cloned, and this is a testament to his style. This a much more mature album and I think one could truly admire the album considering he made it as soon as he got out of prison. Most people visit their families, or explore the country and see how it is changed, but no, Varg did none of this, instead he came back, moved to B\u00f8 (home to Norway\u2019s biggest water park!) and started doing what he loved most: making some kvlt-ass black metal.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the five black metal recorded pre-jail for Varg Vikernes and, despite its shorter length, it lives up to the other releases without any questions asked.\n\n\nThis is probably, bar some of his electronic affairs, one of Varg's most minimal and ambient records, despite being the only one to feature 100% guitar orientated tracks. As has been widely documented, the beauty of Varg's music has never been technicality but here he especially relies on brilliant songwriting, all encompassing production and vocal lines that make you feel his anguish to communicate an atmosphere that is, for me, unmatched by any other artist past or present.\n\n\nAs I mentioned before, the riffs on this release are somewhat simple chords that develop and grow through the tracks, incorperating layers of melody that drift in and out creating a wash of sound that, once fully devop and progress throughout the tracks, can take you to another world in your very own head. Bass guitar generally contributes as accompaniment only but is very audible and sometimes takes a different direction, slowly taking another road only to be slowly brought back to the main melody with seamless ease. Drums are not fast, not technical and not even stand out but serve another purpose which is simply to accompany the journey. Mostly adverse to the standard in rock music, the drums are used more in common with the traits of classical music, in the sense that they take a back seat to keep concentration on the song development at hand or even, at some points, are just completely left out. Don't get me wrong though, when the melodies and construction of these tracks are as good as some of these, you are thankful for it. \n\n\nI'm trying hard to avoid talking about single tracks as it's more of an all encompassing listen, however I will have to be forgiven for saying a couple of words on what is one of my favourite Burzum tracks, \"Dominus Sathanus\". This song really, even almost 20 years down the line, gives me hope that it is possible to write small symphonies lacking percussion yet still assign it to part of the metal genre. The gentle build up of almost confused and bewildered notation at the beginning of the track only develops into a haunting and eerie middle section before building up and by the end creating an almost folky and epic outro which creates an atmosphere which makes a 3 minute track feel like I have been lost in for hours.\n\n\nBoth first and last tracks take similar form although the latter being longer and the pacing slightly more abrupt, being perfectly used to conclude the album. There is also more of the percussive techniques mentioned using a combination of very fast and minimal drumming akin to Fenriz on \"Transilvanian Hunger\" and at points creating such a slow down and appreciation for tempo change that percussion is left out entirely. It is this sense and concentration on song development found here that really creates such a rewarding listen and brings metal to another level of artistic integrity.\n\n\nOverall this is one of my favourites as you may have gathered and the reason it misses out on perfect for me is the completely unexplained abrupt ending of the first track, which as much as I try to think about, just confuses me. It just seems far too random to be on purpose. Either way this is essential listening for Burzum fans, black metal fans and metal fans alike and I cannot praise it highly enough, as well as all of Burzum's other early work. With his new opus on the horizon I worry that it will not live up to what once was, however we can all live in the knowledge that whatever is released from here on in there will always be the unmatcheable atmosphere and beauty of a bizarre intellectual visionary's early 90's output.\n",
        "\nFor my second album review, I\u2019m doing Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf (damned if I know how to pronounce that) by Burzum.\n\nFirst off, I\u2019ll say that even though this is Burzum, it\u2019s not at all what comes to mind when people think about the band. In other words, everything on Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf is done with a keyboard. It isn\u2019t black metal by any stretch of the imagination, outside of the fact that some of the songs have a creepy feeling similar to the music from Filosofem or Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.\n\nThe overall sound of the music isn\u2019t at all like the music from Burzum\u2019s other ambient album, Dau\u00f0i Baldrs. All the things that were wrong with Dau\u00f0i Baldrs have been reduced here. For one thing, the songs have more layers and variation, and flow more, making them feel much more open and free. They don\u2019t have that same rigid feeling that Dau\u00f0i Baldrs had. Best of all, the songs progress quicker, and have shorter running time to boot. I wouldn\u2019t completely jump on the Burzum bandwagon and say \u201cVarg is an absolute musical genius,\u201d because, while this does have a pretty strong atmosphere for me, it isn\u2019t a masterwork, and I do feel that this album was an experimental thing; a way for Varg to pass the time in prison while keeping up with his interest in music. But while the problems from Dau\u00f0i Baldrs are reduced, they are still present. There are songs on here (Tuistoz Herz for example) that could have been much better if there had been more variation and had been shorter, although the improved atmosphere in this album does somewhat make up for it.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d say that if you want to sample a song or two from this album, the highlights for me are Frij\u00f4s Goldene Tr\u00e4nen and Der Tod Wuotans. Frij\u00f4s Goldene Tr\u00e4nen is a pretty short song, clocking in at two minutes or so. Whenever I finish listening to the album, it\u2019s the song that resonates with me the most, and I usually get a strong sensation of floating during the song. Der Tod Wuotans is dragged on a little bit too long, but other than that it\u2019s probably the most atmospheric song on here, especially if you're looking at the cool cover art while listening to it. There is one particular song that usually gets on my nerves for being much too repetitive, and that\u2019s Ansuzgardaraiw\u00f4. It has a pretty cool intro, and then a louder synth pattern comes in, which also sounds good\u2026 until it\u2019s repeated a million times. Not much atmosphere in the song, either. \n\nSo, all in all, this album definitely takes a while to get used to, but if you go in with an open mind, you\u2019ll probably warm up to it. But I do think that it could have definitely been better.\n",
        "\nSo the second of the two ambient releases by Burzum is Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf. Even though some of the problems from Dau\u00f0i Baldrs are fixed, there are still quite a few problems in this release as well. The only thing I can compare Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf to would be Dau\u00f0i Baldrs I guess. Well when you compare Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf to Dau\u00f0i Baldrs it\u2019s a massive improvement. The songs are much shorter, most songs have more than just two or three keyboard melodies in them, and there\u2019s no more MIDI use. However, it plays out just like Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, so it can be rather boring. \n\nJust like the last album the songs are very simple. Each song has about one or two main melodies played throughout while another melody is played in the background of the first melody. Yet that\u2019s the problem, each song has only a few melodies in it. The songs are shorter which is better, yet it\u2019s just as dull as the last album because just two melodies in each song don\u2019t cut it. \n\nEach song on Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf comes with included lyrics for each song just as on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs, but the problem is still the same as on Dau\u00f0i Baldrs. For me it has to do with uncreative thinking I guess. I just find it hard to picture all of what\u2019s going on in a generally short song. I read the lyrics in \u201cDer Weinende Hadnur\u201d, but the song isn\u2019t enough to picture all the information in the lyrics (the songs under two minutes). \n\nThere are two ways that you can look at Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, both of which involve it being an ambient release. The first one would be that it creates a depressing and saddening atmosphere. The second one would be that it\u2019s an emotionally heavy album full of feeling that tells an epic story. However, you cannot have both of them for this album. Now when I look at it by the first one mentioned, I can see an image. Think about it, the albums long, boring, and tiresome. When I listen to it I get tired, and when I get tired I get depressed, so it works out for me. Yet, when I look at it by the second way, I don\u2019t see anything. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s me being unimaginative or what, but when I listen to this album, and try to picture what\u2019s going on in the song my mind is blank. I can\u2019t really pick up any sort of feeling in it or anything. I mean lets face it, it\u2019s a keyboard, and it\u2019s an inanimate object. You can\u2019t really feel anything with just a keyboard. If there were some vocals or anything else really I guess I could see some in there, but just not with only a keyboard. \n\nFix the major flaws of the previous album (MIDI sound and song length) yet don\u2019t fix the other flaws (bland, boring songs) is all there is to Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf really. It\u2019s just quiet music that doesn\u2019t go anywhere that you listen to in the background. I guess I would consider the album more depressing compared to the other album but that\u2019s only because this one makes me tired a lot faster because it doesn\u2019t sound like some old video game. But really it\u2019s nothing more than background music.\n",
        "\nDau\u00f0i Baldrs, which is the first of two ambient albums, is somewhat of an ambient release I guess. Unlike the later album Hli\u00f0skj\u00e1lf, this album is composed entirely out of a MIDI keyboard. It\u2019s hard to build any sort of ambience to draw the listening into with MIDI sounds though, so listening to Dau\u00f0i Baldrs sometimes gets your bored, rather it be the MIDI device used on this album, or the fact that all the songs (especially the longer ones) are dragged on and on constantly having the same two or three MIDI melodies repeated over and over one after another. \n\nDau\u00f0i Baldrs is entirely used with a MIDI device so the overall sound is like an 80\u2019s Nintendo game. That alone might annoy people enough not to get this, for the actual sound given off is basically an old Nintendo game soundtrack. This doesn\u2019t bother me that much like it would others so I don\u2019t really have a huge problem with Varg using a MIDI keyboard for this release. \n\nAmbience is the thing that this album does not have however, which is due to the MIDI sound. Out of the six songs there\u2019s about two different emotions that you can pick up on, happy and sad. \u201cHermo\u00f0r \u00c1 Helfer\u00f0\u201d is the only track that gives off any sort of positive atmosphere only due to the cheese melody used for the two minute length. The rest of the songs sound as if they\u2019re supposed to be depressing or something, although the line between depressed and bored is very thin here. \n\nEvery song has about three melodies repeated over and over, which is why this is such a repetitive and boring album. The fact that there\u2019s really little to no atmosphere at all is also why it will bore you (as it did me). The best track on here would have to be \u201cIlla Ti\u00f0andi\u201d, which is also the longest track on here. Not for the fact that it does anything interesting, but only for the fact that this is the only track that I can pick up any sort of sadness. It\u2019s a really slow paced song, with a repetitive keyboard, and if you listen to it late at night it can sometimes make you depressed and tired. But other than that no real songs stick out.\n\nThe one thing that would save this album would be the lyrical booklet. They are supposed to tell what is going on in the song. They don\u2019t really work for me though. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the fact that I don\u2019t have a good imagination, or that Varg can picture what I can\u2019t in his music. They make interesting reading nonetheless, and if you can picture what\u2019s going on you might find some joy in this album. \n\nIt may seem like a bad album to you, as a lot of people will not like this album. The songs are lengthy, all have about three melodies played through the entire song, and it\u2019s made entirely out of a MIDI keyboard. I for one don\u2019t necessary hate it, for I can tolerate the MIDI sound. I can listen to it in the background with no problem even though I might get a little bored. This album is basically just elevator music for me. But I could also go my entire life without ever hearing it again and I wouldn\u2019t care also.\n",
        "\nBurzum plays what is easily my favorite metal music, but as most people will usually say, there is at least SOMETHING by a favorite artist that you don't like. Seeing that this release contains three songs, I'll give up to 33% points per song.\n\nThe first track on 'Aske' is 'Stemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet.' Regardless of how I feel about the EP as a whole, this song is one of my favorite songs by Burzum. It would easily be my favorite if it weren't for the abrupt ending of the song. When I first listened to 'Aske,' I had downloaded it from the internet, and I thought that the person I had gotten it from had a messed-up release. However, when I bought the 'Burzum / Aske' release from a local record store to check, the same abrupt ending was present. If this song had an ending that did not make the song seem fragmented, 'Aske' would be considerably higher rated. The lyrics tell of a journey through a dark and dreary forest after being summoned by a voice.\n\nThe second track, 'Dominus Sathanas,' is a nearly instrumental track that is a slow transition into the final track. The pace of 'Dominus Sathanas' doesn't feel right after the force of 'Stemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet,' but after the first minute or so, the pace seems natural. It is a fairly peaceful song for black metal, besides the one line of vocals: \"AAAARRRGHHHH!!!\" \n\n'A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit' is the final track, and transitions in very smoothly after 'Dominus Sathanas.' The version of 'A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit' on 'Aske' is an extended mix of the same track on Burzum's self-titled debut album. Besides the fact that the version on 'Aske' is about 2 minutes longer, it also has a different atmosphere than that from 'Burzum.' The version on this EP feels a little slower and restrained. The vocals on both versions tell a story of death, and the decay of this death comes even after his death when he return as a ghost. \n\n'Aske' is an EP that Varg regretted releasing, according to an interview on metalcrypt.com. In his own words: \"I wish I had never recorded this mini-LP in the first place, because it is only an mini-LP, and I don't like neither EPs, mini-LPs, \"best of\" albums, compilations or singles. If it's not a full-length album it's not worth releasing...\" It doesn't surprise me, then, that I do not like this album. I read the interview (http://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=170) after I had already listened to 'Aske,' so that didn't sway how I felt about the work. But, knowing that he wasn't fully satisfied with this work might show why I don't like it. If the artist isn't completely behind his work, he can't expect others to be.\n\nI can never complain about Varg's talent. What people have to remember is that even if they don't like the music of Burzum, it is all recorded by one person (not counting Euronymous' solo in 'War' from Burzum's debut). All of the instruments were recorded separately and put together with great attention how they would flow together, and those deep, piercing shrieked vocals come from the same man. However, compared to some of Varg's other works, the lengths of the latter two tracks on 'Aske' detract from how much I enjoy it. I don't have a problem with long songs, necessarily, but compared to Burzum's earlier work, the longer songs are less enjoyable.\n\nThe final scores for the songs are:\n\n''Stemmen Fra T\u00e5rnet' - 30%\n'Dominus Sathanas' - 15%\n'A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit' - 10%\n\nOverall - 55%\n",
        "\nThis album is my first real touch with Burzum, though I of course know the band, it's controversial history and as Mayhem fan I of course first was one of those 'Varg killed Euronymous so I don't listen that band!!!!!1\" However, Burzum is far too interesting - and as I have noted, far too good - band to just be ignored.\n\nFirst of all, music of Burzum is excellent. It's raw produced, Varg Vikernes' vocals are extremely raw shrieks, riffs and guitar & bass lines are great and composed with talent and patience, and especially Vikernes' double bass drumming is extremely effective (though he is better known as guitar and bassist, what is a shame...). Interesting is also the diversity of the music of Burzum. There are Venom and Bathory style \"black 'n' roll\" tracks, then there are extremely cold and raw produced minimalistic tracks which remind me from Darkthrone and Carpathian Forest, and even they are bit like some tracks on Mayhem's \"De Mysteriis Dom. Sathanas\", mostly they remind me from track \"Life Eternal\". Also there are few interesting ambient experiments, first black metal ambient track called \"Gebrechichkeit\" from \"Filosofem\" and then two real ambient tracks. First of them, \"Balferd Baldrs\", suffers from terrible MIDI sounds, but the last one and album closer, \"Ansuzgardaraiwo\" is just great.\n\nNot only Burzum music is musically great, but also this is very good compilation. The double LP I've got is great looking, with atmospheric covers and the tracks are well selected, showing the diversity of Burzum music. Also there is an interesting introduction to history of the band, as well as some stuff about their musical style and style changes. Very favorable compilation, which I gladly recommend to people who, like me, are interested in Burzum, but feel unfamiliar with the knowledge about the music of the band.\n",
        "\nAt the most basic level of categorization there are two kinds of music; the kind that shows what its intentions are and the kind that challenges the listener to find the intention or attribute something to it which may or may not be the correct interpretation. Most music that attempts to do the latter and gets any sort of mass attention are ones that do this through lyrical metaphors or abstract themes laced within the storyline of a concept album, such as is the case with artists like Dio and Fates Warning. Within the underground world of death metal and other extreme music that utilizes atonal practices, the lyrics tend to be straight forward but the disjointedness of the music itself creates a distorting effect that tends to challenge the listener to find reason in the extremity of what is being experienced. But finding music that is without words and also, either intentionally or by sheer circumstance, challenges the ears to put aside what it is used to with easier forms of music.\n\nIt was much more by circumstance than by intention that \u201cDau\u00f0i Baldrs\u201d is so difficult for most ears to accept, as it essentially comes in an entirely midi generated sound package, not all that far away from what would comprise a Nintendo Entertainment System game soundtrack. There isn\u2019t really any atmospheric differentiation to speak of within this musical medium, except those created by the synthesized timbres of each instrument that wanders in and out of the mix, an affect of switching from a soft to a full sound instantaneously known as terraced dynamics, which was common in Baroque music. This medium, contrary to what might be assumed, is actually perfect for bringing out the usage of this means of dynamic contrast by presenting the listener with an auspiciously different sound than what he/she is probably used to and also plays off the minimalist model that Varg has utilized for his many past ambient works.\n\nThis album is, in every way, a soundtrack. It is rigidly programmatic, in much the same way that an opera or a symphonic work based on some preexisting story would be. The low fidelity technology employed gives it the feel of a dated NES role-playing game version of the tale (my own tolerance for these sounds may lie partly in that I worked with midi extensively while taking music composition courses in college and still do), but its intention is fairly clear from a formal standpoint since not only are the title\u2019s of each song revealing of the emotions they portray, but each song comes with a description of which event in the story of the Norse god Balder. The challenge comes into play by attempting to visualize these events happening within your own mind while the music is on, rather than listening to it while doing something else such as working on your computer or trying to go to sleep, although the serene piano ambience of \u201cIlla Ti\u00f0andi\u201d are a pleasant though somber way to walk through the gilded gate of dreams. Although this requires an effort that many would not wish to give or spend money on trying, for some reason it came rather quickly for me, probably because it was my first Burzum album and I didn\u2019t approach it with any expectations. Nonetheless, I had to listen to it 6 or 7 times before I could fully visualize what I believe is the imagery behind the simple, droning lines that interweave with each other at elongated intervals.\n\nThe strength of this album, by virtue of the format it comes in, relies completely on quality of ideas because there are not many of them and there is no elaborate production to make lesser ideas appear great. The lead off and title song \u201cDau\u00f0i Baldrs\u201d presents a singular theme of 16 notes, all in a singular flowing rhythm, that goes from one instrumentation to another and embodies both a sense of tragedy and of impending drama. There are two countering themes that come and go while the principle one almost always present, creating a series of differing sections out of a very limited set of ideas, creating the image of the most beloved of gods lying dead at the hands of treachery. \u201cHermo\u00f0r \u00c1 Helfer\u00f0\u201d has a much simpler model and gives off feelings of both peace and determination, as a lone traveler sets out on a grand mission. Things start to get a bit more complex afterwards as the plot thickens and the revelations of the future of all characters within the realm of Norse myths come to fruition. \u201cB\u00e1lfer\u00f0 Baldrs\u201d mostly drones, but utilizes a short ending section with a lone piano that disrupts what has been a very strictly formatted minimal approach. \n\n\u201c\u00cd Heimr Heljar\u201d is the most intense of the lot in terms of passion, loaded with a lot of percussive sounds, almost like the stomping of giants during a battle charge, and accompanied by slightly more complex themes. Things pull back significantly with \u201cIlla Ti\u00f0andi\u201d, which is basically a soft piano drone that slowly adds a solemn voice accompaniment. It flows in much the same way as \u201cTomhet\u201d and \u201cRundtg\u00e5ing Av Den Transcendentale Egenhetens St\u00f8tte\u201d, the two ambient works from the previous albums did, and lingers a long time with little change. The closing work \u201cM\u00f3ti Ragnarokum\u201d, which depicts the coming of the end time prophecy of Northern myths, sees the return of a more complex approach that exploits the extremely limited arrangement to its fullest. The themes at work here are not just memorable and effective, they become absolutely spellbinding once they\u2019ve fully set in, particularly once the full string orchestra sound and percussion comes in. This one also makes use of both an intro and an outro where a single instrument plays a fairly involved them compared to the rhythmically rudimentary ones that dominate the early songs, but still stays within the confines of standard metric timing.\n\nWhile this album is quite an experience, it is not perfect and actually is among the weaker of Varg\u2019s offerings. Although he put together a lot of really good ideas here, there is a lot that could have been expanded upon or even varied a bit, while maintaining the same time lengths. This music is meant to develop slowly and give the listener time to fully comprehend each theme, but this moves just a little too slow and relies a bit too much on repetition rather than variation and contrast. It is difficult to really recommend because it is purposefully set up to have a limited audience, made up mostly by those who fully understand the egoistic nature of great songwriting and don\u2019t feel the need to be pandered to. But there is definitely a purpose to this, and it might not be the same for you as it was for me, but if you are curious then definitely give this a chance.\n",
        "\nHonestly, while this is a cool album it seems that the main reason why people love Burzum is because the production\u2019s so unusual but yet so good. The thin, trebly guitar tone that many people would confuse for static, the way all the instruments combine into this rather alien thing; some extremely weak transmission beamed from a few galaxies away and not quite put together right; an ethereal sort of white noise with the bass hovering underneath it all.\n\nThe production is probably the best thing about Burzum but overall it\u2019s pretty clear that Varg knows how to write a melody or two, and I can see why some people are gay for him. The songs are fairly minimalist throughout; a few different riffs follow some rather straight-forward patterns, the static-y, mid paced churning slowly gets really hypnotic and luckily for all Varg (most of the time) has a knack for ending songs before the hypnosis ends and boredom begins. \n\nRepeated listening does suggest that there\u2019s a bit more album then you\u2019d first think; it\u2019s hardly a symphony but there\u2019s often some synths mixed way down and the constant undercurrent of bass is extremely cool. Overall the whole thing just flows really well; constant tension is built up by the repetitive riffs and themes, the synths way back in the mix add a barely perceptible sense of progress that keeps thing interesting. It helps that some of the riffs are of a really high quality, of course; \"Erblicket Der\u2026\" a particularly cool song with a bunch of riffs all rotating around some similar sort of motif, \"Dunkelheit\"\u2019s slow and mysterious synth line. Varg\u2019s not afraid to chuck in a few more left field type songs, too; the drumless, enigmatic \"Gebrechblahblah part 2\" being a pretty good example, minimalist synth lines echoing over some really ominous, heavily distorted arpeggios. It\u2019s a classic song, no doubt; perhaps Burzum isn\u2019t entirely about production, after all.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s really good about this album is the fact that it doesn\u2019t reveal all of itself straight away. Whereas one listen to, say, Drudkh will quickly reveal \"these guys like Burzum and forests\", this album just isn\u2019t that simple, especially as I don\u2019t understand any Norwegian. It\u2019s much more opaque then a lot of music; it doesn\u2019t show itself that quickly. What\u2019s his inspiration, here? Space? Odinism? Nature? Hatred of non-Aryans? Love for Jesus? Skate shoes? It\u2019s great! I don\u2019t know, that may sound kind of dumb but I love the way that this album is a real challenging listen, even though it\u2019s perhaps not the harshest thing around. Certainly, this album rewards replaying over and over again, not only because the music\u2019s enjoyable but because it\u2019s an album you can lose yourself in. Shit is deep, man.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll happily agree with those who call Varg a very talented songwriter, but those who say he can write good synth-based ambient are in need of a bitch slap and possibly decapitation. \"Rundgang Um\u2026\" is even more boring then the entire Dauoi Baldrs album, no mean feat. It\u2019s the kind of thing that would be fine as a 30 second interlude, a kind of spooky three note figure getting repeated over and over again. However, it goes for 50 times that length, and surprisingly enough it wears thin fairly quickly. What the hell possessed Varg to write this? Surely when he was playing the record back he would\u2019ve went \"Wow that\u2019s really boring, perhaps I should just delete that song\". It\u2019s not good on any level; an ok arpeggio with some spacey synths repeated a few million times, with some other layers very, very slowly coming in. Ok, so it might\u2019ve worked as an 5 minute long outro if it built up to some sort of super layered freakout. As it stands, it just sits there, and after a minute or so of going \"this is kind of cool, here\u2019s hoping the song kicks in soon\" you\u2019ll likely get very bored and perhaps a little bit angry that Varg let his last decent album (for now, anyway) have such a pointless, long, infuriating tune in it.\n\nI\u2019m a bit conflicted about what to give this. If the long, pointless ambient tune wasn\u2019t there somewhere around 90% would be appropriate, as it\u2019s pretty freaking good. As it stands though there is a 25 minute long bit of boredom, so in protest of that it gets a 75%. It\u2019s a good album and worth getting, certainly, just skip the last track.\n",
        "\nIn the name of science, I am going to be as objective as possible in my critique of Burzum's first foray into pure ambiance, Daudi Baldrs. In order to do this, I am going to look at and judge the album from several angles in an attempt to leave all bias out of the picture. In order to remain focused on objectivity, an approach like this is entirely necessary.\n\nFROM A TECHNICAL STANDPOINT: The entire album is made using a MIDI device. Let it be known that MIDI is not an automatic allegiance to suck, and most of the best classic videogame tunes were made with this or can easily be replicated this way. Therefore, I can't bash Varg for releasing an album with this sound, even if it is kind of what he was stuck with at the time. But by that same respect, I can not forgive him for the mind bogglingly lazy songwriting. Each song is quite literally one or two melodies across five instruments that are repeated ad nauseam. There is absolutely no substance to virtually any song here. If you listen attentively, you're likely to fall asleep. If you keep it as background music, you're likely to never notice it's playing. If you put it on when you try to fall asleep, you'll be unable to sleep because you'll be shaking with rage due to how ungodly boring and pointless this album is. I don't know what kind of human being would hear this and be 100% satisfied with it's content. I understand that Varg comes from a somewhat minimalistic black metal background, but this is pushing it. I've heard more interesting SunnO))) songs, and I fucking HATE drone. \n\nAS A BLACK METAL ALBUM: Ha, this isn't black metal. I know some people who hate this purely because of that, and think it shouldn't have the name of Burzum on it because of it. I just want to point out how absurd that is. Worry not, I'm not actually judging this as a black metal album.\n\nAS AN AMBIENT ALBUM: I am, however, going to judge it as a piece of ambient music. In this respect, it fails extremely hard. Sure, an ambient soundscape shouldn't take center stage and kick your ass like so many other forms of music. But it shouldn't be this utterly inconsequential either. The only reason any of this is memorable is because of the unabashed repetition. Remember what made St. Anger so awful? It was the fact that every song was basically one mediocre/bad song repeated twice from front to back, Varg accomplished this very feat six years prior. Hell, I think the opener is one song repeated three times for nine minutes. Since he made this with a computer, he quite literally copy pasted the same bullshit over and over and over again for seemingly no reason other than to PISS ME OFF. I'll give him credit for at least getting the general atmosphere that he intends to exude to come across well, it's just unfortunate that it drags on for so long. It's unnecessary to prolong these compositions as long as most of them have been. Surely, ten minutes isn't overkill, especially for this genre, but ten minutes is sure as shit overkill for three melodies. The general mood of the album is great, but the content is lacking and frustrating as a result. No development, no evolution, no point. This is an entire album of town music from Zelda. You know, the simple theme that was made to loop endlessly and convey very little. Sure, there's a bit more emotion and suspense in here, but not enough to not imagine Hermodor A Helferd playing over the scene as I punt chickens around Kakariko Village.\n\nAS A COASTER: This seems to be the one thing that this CD is good for. It is wide enough to cover most any size can/bottle of beverage and thick enough to keep the moisture from soaking through. The only downside is that it's rather pricey for it's apparent intended usage. Also, the material and smooth texture allow it to slide around a little bit more than is comfortable, but it keeps the Schitz sweat off of my coffee table, so I endorse Varg's unintended line of coasters.\n\nAS A FRISBEE: This is probably the most fun you can have with the disc, but it's also the most dangerous. If you are playing with a partner that throws it too hard, there is a possibility you could cut your hand or get the CD embedded in your skull. And after the headache and metaphorical embedding it'll give you from listening to it, this is the last thing you want to happen. If you try to avoid this problem by playing fetch with your dog, this is only good for one throw, as your dog's bite will most likely break it.\n\nFINAL THOUGHT: Well, no matter how you judge it, this isn't worth much at all. It's an incredibly boring journey through what should be a fascinating and encapsulating story. Daudi Baldrs features six pedestrian compositions with no development in the melodies within each track. No progression, no substance, no value. Seriously, when people don't give enough of a shit to spell the artist's fucking name correctly on the cover, you know you've cocked up big time.\n",
        "\nThis self-titled LP debut by Burzum competes with Transilvanian Hunger for best black metal record of all time in my opinion. Every other Burzum influenced band no matter how good they might be (and there are few to none) sound downright silly in comparison to this misanthropic mastery of Norwegian heathenry. The concept behind this album is simple: to entrance you with pagan legend in the starkest possible sense of Norse context. It may sound complicated in idea but here it is simple in design. Works of genius are never elaborate; only honest and original. This was made by someone who is in touch with his heritage and knew how to express it in accordance with the simplicity of nature which he was in tune with. That someone is none other than Count Grishnackh. I will not delve into the man\u2019s already well documented notoriety except to say that his reputation outside the studio is the consequence of a spirited conviction vice the other way around. Whether that facet of him is misguided or not is for none of us to decide since we don\u2019t know him personally nor present when and where any of those events actually took place. This is about Burzum. The music. The haunting sounds of\u2026\n\n...Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown. The blasts beats on this first track make it pretty clear that this is one straight forward black metal album unlike Varg\u2019s later albums which incorporated more ambient details. The layers of his guitars are profound. The speed is fast and the riffs are primitive tones of blunt atmosphere. There is a combative sense of urgency in the percussion. Varg is a very good drummer for this kind of black metal. He has established his own rhythms and variances when the song slows down and it never seems off. No surprise that the bass is not very noticeable but it is more functional than what you might expect even though it is nowhere near as hypnotic as his playing of the instrument when he recorded with Mayhem. The speedy passage on this song toward the end is a black metal clinic. This shows off the thin production quality and it sounds evil as ever. Blazing through and down until you can no longer fathom what can possibly be encountered only then when you are swallowed up by\u2026\n\n\u2026Ea, Lord of the Depths as he lurks the chasms of the Baltic. This song feels like a celebration of pure Tolkien. I\u2019ve always found it to be one of Burzum\u2019s trademark-like songs in sound. There is a little wobbly honk of feedback right after the beats kick in and the diminished chords ram this beast through. It\u2019s all so perfect and so organic. This the type of Burzum song that makes me picture the band\u2019s album covers because the sound is so stark and ancient. I mentioned the bass earlier and it\u2019s invisible but effective presence but here if you listen perceptively, the bass on here is what gives the song aggression. I would describe it as a sort of audio illusion since the riffs are what will grab you the most. The mix of the bass on this is ringing all the way through in a very \u201caquatic\u201d way. People are so used to not even paying attention to the bass on most black metal now because it is typically marginalized in a lot of records in the genre but you cannot underestimate Varg\u2019s trickery in using it as a secret ingredient to project even more dissonance on these riffs and blasts. I was one to pick up on it though as it seemed to be the musical representation of the mythical beast in the title as it slithered and slurped up any seafaring souls of yore. Even if those souls could chart a course around him in those dark waters they might not be as fortunate to stave off the eerie\u2026\n\n\u2026Black Spell of Destruction! Melancholy and foreboding chants of disharmonic serenity awaits in this cold skinned black metal movement. While Vikernes\u2019 vocals are not the greatest in the genre, at least they are different than most of what other bands were doing at the time. His are torturous and primal but terrifying all at the same time. This song is very slow and is driven by pertinent beats while chromatic values are placed throughout one serpentine scale. This song sounds like a medieval tale of torture and you will feel it as such as the drum pattern guides you along what sounds to be a labyrinth of cold, dark air where much suffering takes place and where no one comes out! It\u2019s an atmosphere that can only be created by a tyrant mind and while the captives of his creation lament their own presence, the mastermind is already busy\u2026\n\n\u2026Channeling The Power Of Souls Into A New God and that deity is getting restless. This mood piece is actually the ambient conclusion to Side Hate. Burzum is the band most prominent for including these synthesizer pieces to go along with his track lists in black metal. As simple as this song sounds, it actually probably took a long time to come up with since there are actually a few complex loops overlapping each other and drifting in and out of several notes with mystical pace. It\u2019s very soothing and hypnotic but creepy at the same time. Don\u2019t get to comfortable because Burzum declares an all out\u2026\n\n\u2026War! What is it good for? Well, absolutely nothin\u2019 except for a chance to enjoy a token thrash song by Burzum! We are now on Side Winter but that doesn\u2019t mean it is time to bundle up and call a temporary ceasefire until spring. This song is a nod to Bathory from the sounds of it but I did not recognize it as such right away due to the vocal presentation by Varg. The pace is about accurate for what is typical of Bathory\u2019s early work. This is a track that is overlooked in Burzum\u2019s discography since the material in Filosofem is more recognizable than this black thrash type of effort. Euronymous cameos with a ratty raw guitar solo at the end that was interesting to hear. Once the fields have been wasted and the bodies of soldiers strewn all throughout the forests, you can sense misery and fallout by the surviving victims and one of them to be found is\u2026\n\n\u2026The Crying Orc as he contemplates suicide. This is a short interlude of brilliant Norwegian black metal darkness. It feels like it was authored by a long ago Pagan woodsman who made music to accompany his Norsk woodcut artwork. Maybe Varg felt like such a figure and he shows it through with this song. I would not be surprised at all if he conjured up this tune while sitting in the middle of the shiny and quiet countryside as he reflected back in humility his own existence as\u2026\n\n\u2026A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit in the grand scheme of Odin\u2019s fleshed out frontiers of forests, fjords and foreboding rivers where trolls bathe and tribal lands divide. This original rendition is so much better than the Aske version which I always felt had too clean a sound. This version though is rougher and truer to form. It\u2019s a dour tour-de-force about death and immortality throughout the lands where Christian imperialism has raped the pride of Norway\u2019s landscapes. The bass-y slowdown toward the end emits dread and loss but may the ghosts of Nordland avenge? That\u2019s the idea behind the vigor in this song as Varg screams and beats his way through the elongated passages of depressive dissonance. Varg must have envisioned the fallout from this tale when he dreamt up\u2026\n\n\u2026My Journey To The Stars. Whether Valhalla is that place or some other astral realm of enshrinement is unknown but the trip is a furious one. The opening riff sounds a little like Ea. It\u2019s a blazing assault of grassroots black metal. The drumming is concise and agile. The bass is more aligned with that which was played on the previous song in that it follows more traditional patterns of conforming structure. Varg is a well organized musical compositionist. Every song on this album has a purpose in the track list. If My Journey To The Stars is thought to be the final place of rest, then it seems likely that you would be wrong because there lies cruelty and unending solitude at the end of this violent jaunt. So many sacrifices and adventurous turns only to find yourself naked, freezing and forever chained up in\u2026\n\n\u2026Dungeons of Darkness where you will go insane with solitude and helplessness. Yes, even the Gods keep such places for their own whim. Another electronic/ ambient track, many will dismiss this one as nonsensical minimalist atmosphere but it is impressively engineered to sound like such a rickety forebode. If you want to know what harsh, three dimensional drone might sound like, this is a very good example. Not only that, but it\u2019s perfectly long and echoes the solitude of ages! This is a fantastic ending to a perfect album. Filosofem was a huge achievement from Burzum, but this album is more upfront, take-no-prisoners type of aggression in pure black metal. \n\nA personal pet peeve of mine has always been when (even by my other favorite) bands proclaim themselves as not musicians but \u201cartists\u201d. This has always annoyed me because it reeks of self-importance and arrogance in pretentious fashion no matter how good their albums are. But this record by Burzum is probably the only piece of work that I would call pure art and music.\n",
        "\nPerfecting a work of art is not necessarily a manner of creating something that is universally accepted as great by all, in fact I actually believe the opposite is often true. It is more a manner of taking the image/sound within oneself and translating it exactly as it was envisioned outward. Whether or not it is recognized as such often depends on what the listener is looking for. Insofar as Varg\u2019s heavily philosophical and atmospheric, six chapter offering \u201cFilosofem\u201d is concerned, the goal is to force the listener to loose himself in a somber haze of ambient sadness, in many cases leaving the realm of metal entirely in the process.\n\nUnlike most albums that are so consistent and lacking in subtlety, there is the potential for a listener to view this as middle-of-the-road quality rather than the extreme of sheer genius versus horrid failure. The first half of this album is situated well within the black metal paradigm, though it is heavily minimalistic in comparison to previous works and is so utterly fuzz drenched that it seems to induce the pain followed by equalization that the ears experience when under water, particularly to ears already familiar with Varg\u2019s former works and other renowned black metal releases of the Norwegian scene. The layering of guitar tracks produces a sound that is very much similar to the experience of being submerged, though the presence of the drums anchors the sound and gives it appeal to those who prefer the metal oriented works of \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d. The opening song \u201cBurzum\u201d (aka \u201cDunkelheit\u201d) is a particular point of interest because even absent the historical knowledge of it being an earlier work of Varg\u2019s, the character of the song and the riff-oriented nature of the guitars contrasts with the rest of the album, despite being tweaked with the same atmospheric keyboard drones and fuzzy mixing job as the rest of the metal works on here.\n\nAs things progress, Varg\u2019s intentions to move away from the past and into uncharted territory become more pronounced. The second and third compositions of the black metal side of this release don\u2019t so much consist of riffs, but of varying degrees of atmospheric and melodic elements. \u201cJesus\u2019 Tod\u201d is densely layered with guitar noise, but primarily functions through slow changing tremolo guitar melodies. They lack the meandering nature of many melodic death acts that picked up on this technique, as well as the neo-tonality of the earlier epic progressive death metal that was also being explored when this was written, and take on a static yet beautiful character. \u201cErblicket Die T\u00f6chter Des Firmaments\u201d carries a somewhat implied melody within it, but mostly coasts through a series of slow changing, snowy sounding chords, while Varg\u2019s vocals sound distant and buried, akin to the depressive state preceding suicide as it appears to the ears as insignificant next to what is going on around it.\n\nAlthough everything on here is fairly long and drawn out, when the transition occurs and the second half of this begins, everything seems to become twice as long and dark. There is no actual time difference between \u201cGebrechlichkeit I & 2\u201d and the last song mentioned, but the now absent drums put forth the illusion of being stranded, not moving forward or backward but simply floating in still water. The keyboard presence takes on more of a prominent role in the mix, but the principle focus shifts to the sea of guitar fuzz and Varg\u2019s woeful and distorted wails. It could be described as the incoherent screams of the last pagan exile against the Christianization of his homeland while dying of hypothermia in the woods during a brutal winter storm and still leave a bit to the imagination.\n\nThe fifth song on here is probably the hardest one to get into, be it concerning black metal fans or anyone else outside of pure ambient keyboard music. Part of my own reason for not being a particularly huge fan of this genre is not so much because of how long and drawn out it tends to be, but because of how such utter simplicity will expose the true credentials of a composer. It is the easiest style to write in, but quite possibly the hardest to write well in, because few ideas or small groups of ideas are worth repeating so many times. But every time I hear this, something clicks after the first 2 minutes and the slow births and equally gradual deaths of 2, 3 and 4 note ideas while intermingling with each other becomes a serene landscape of self-contemplation. It\u2019s my personal favorite of all of Varg\u2019s dark ambient keyboard works, and to the dismay of many fans of his older work became the dominant influence in his music, though likely caused more so by his imprisonment than anything else. \n\nPerhaps perfection is a subjective concept, but that is what I\u2019ve consistently heard after about 8 months of this album challenging my premises about metal music. It is definitely not an easy album to listen to, especially when considering the active effort at making its production quality both a razor to cut away superficial listeners from its presence and a non-issue in the determination of this album\u2019s merits. It\u2019s a testament that musical greatness is not solely found in how much you put into something, but in the quality of the ideas that make it out of the mind and onto the canvass, and ultimately how honest the final product is in articulating the ideas that it came out of.\n",
        "\nBurzum Demo I. is the most raw release of Burzum ever. The rythm is slower than on later tracks and sometimes the parts are strangley mixed, but its still Varg and this is still Burzum - and that makes it great. Vikernes put soul and heart in it and rawness makes it just better.\n\n\"Lost Wisdom\" - The guitars do get kinda annoying sometimes on this track, because of bad mixing, but its raw and thrashy - just as it should be. Vikernes is a great composer and drums mix with the melody perfectly. \n\nThe fact that this album was produced so poorly, makes it really just better. The drums on \"Spell of Destruction\" are 1000 times better than on later productions. They sometimes sound like smashing some wood with drum sticks, and its extremly fantastic. \n\n\"Channeling The Power Of Souls Into a New God\" - Wow, amazing, reminds me of old Mortiis' stuff, its pure ambient and beautiful. Varg is a genius composer, as I said before, and that fused with his feelings, creates togethere great ambient music and thats why Burzum didn't stop losing fans even after he switched to ambient.\n\nI give 50 % for great composition and the other 50 % for extreme production, which I love so much. Hails!\n",
        "\nFirst let me get something off my chest: I fucking love Burzum. You know those fanboys who can talk all day about a band that plays the \"best music evah\", has a bunch of band shirts with the band and would go to great lengths to get hold of some obscure demo or bootleg just because it's with their favorite band?\nThat's me. And my band is Burzum.\n\nThat said, this album was actually the first Burzum album I got, and Burzum was what got me into black metal so when I got it I was blown away by it's awesomeness. Now, after having acquired all of Burzum's albums, I can look at this with the eyes of a critic, because compared to the rest of the material, Det Som Engang Var is okay. But just okay.\n\nAs I suppose everyone knows all of the material on this album was recorded by sole Burzum member Varg Vikernes back in '91 or '92, and was later released shortly before Vikernes was arrested for various church burnings. Does that have anything to do with the music? No. So lets stay on topic:\n\nStarting out the album is \"Den Onde Kysten\", which is really just another word for \"Intro\". And boy, this is creepy. Quiet, almost melancholic use of an organ-like sound accompagnied by... snakes..? You may think 'wtf?' but for some reason this works well in creating a somewhat creepy atmosphere, and I sometimes think of Diablo II when I hear this. You know, the last level of Act I where you run around the catacombs beneath a haunted chapel? This should be how it would sound down there.\n\nOf course nothing lasts forever, and \"Den Onde Kysten\" is only 2:20 long and all of a sudden POW! you get attacked by \"Key to the Gate\" with its deliberately chaotic and dissonant intro. The fast, pounding guitar roams around, finds a decent riff, plays that for a while and then discards it and goes back to roaming. Later in the song you get a slower section with a more hypnotic, mesmerizing guitar, all while Vikernes' demented screams continue to haunt the song with incomprehensible lyrics (thank God they're written on the cover). Also, the song has something as rare as a Burzum guitar solo - which is odd when you think about how Burzum is all about atmosphere, and solos tend to break out of any atmosphere. Whatever the case, at 2:56 begins the solo - and it's actually quite good. It shows how you don't have to get all Laiho/Malmsteen/Dimebag-shreddy in order to make a nice guitar solo - a few notes is all it takes. Also notice how at 3:34 the drums a short moment jump out of the mix and quickly finds the rhythm again. Funny.\n\nNext up is \"En Ring Til Aa Herske\" (\"One ring to rule\") - well, the title cements the fact that Burzum is all about J.R.R. Tolkien. This song makes use of some pretty weird 'chanting' vocals. Especially considering the fact that Burzum vocals are normally only Vikernes' raspy shrieks, but of course the shrieks are still present. This song has a nice, heavy main riff and if not for the vocals this could probably even appeal to non-black metal fans. As opposed to \"Key to the Gate\", which did progress at least a little, this song basically repeats the same riff ad nauseam.\n\n\"Lost Wisdom\" contains the first lines I was able to understand from this album without having to look on the cover! \"I believe.... *incomprehensible coughing* ...reality\". Also, there are some pretty good drums on here and around 2:20 are some tonal arrangements that are very typical of the early Burzum material. At 2:53 one particular guitar suddenly shines through which makes for a good, a bit sad and 'cold' atmosphere. After that the song just meanders around a bit at random.\n\nAfter the black metal ends you arrive at the place depicted on the album cover - a dark, desolated realm. As you stop up to marvel at the ruined, twisted landscape \"Han Som Reiste\" starts playing and tells its tale about how this was once a place bursting with activity, but now everything is gone.\nWell... that's my idea anyway. However you choose to look at it, \"Han Som Reiste\" is still a great synth-melody. Yes, it's simple as hell, but after all that's what Burzum is good at - making simplicity sound good. The song jumps back and forth between a \"dark\" and a \"light\" melody, where the light one actually has a slight medieval feeling to it (in your face, Sigurd Wongraven!).\n\nThe start of the next song, with the beautiful name \"Naar Himmelen Klarner\" (go look it up in a dictionary) is actually very beautiful in its own right. It's just a guitar repeating some different chords and melodies, but it's done in a way that conjures up a beautiful feeling of the sky clearing after heavy rainfall. Around the 2 minute mark drums and stuff is added, and that kinda kills the atmosphere a bit, but otherwise the song just repeats the same riff for nearly 4 minutes, which may be just a tad too much...\n\nWell, if you thought that the sky was clearing after the last track you were wrong! \"Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn\" starts out with some harsh drums just blasting away, but at 1:30 everything suddenly changed to an almost polka-like feel. What. The. Fuck.?! Burzum isn't supposed to make me want to dance! This tendency quickly disappears and the heavy drumming reenters. This is hard, unforgiving and pounding almost to the point where it could be mistaken for thrash metal. Around 3:30 another break, and now comes a more consistent rhythm, which unfortunately showcases the incredibly boring guitar. 4:50 more interlude build-up to... something... and hey, the chant from \"En Ring...\" is back! This interlude-sounding... something just continues on as Vikernes apparently tries to tell us something, but fails to get through (at least to me). Actually it sound more like a band that enters an interlude, forgets what they were supposed to do after that, and just loops the interlude. Towards the end the drums come back, but too late to save the song from being a tad incoherent.\n\nAs outro we have \"Svarte Troner\". To put it simple imagine a person sitting in a cold, empty room mumbling something incoherent while spontaneously pounding on different things with a drum stick, meanwhile a gas pipe is leaking - perhaps he did that - and you can hear the gas slowly filling the room as if the person has decided to stop living, outside the room you can hear someone who is playing ...is that an accordion? At last the person gets up, pushes a special button on his wristwatch and is beamed up into his spaceship.\nSounds trippy, doesn't it? Well, that's kinda what \"Svarte Troner\" made me think of. A very very weird way to end an album, I'd say.\n\nMany peope, myself included, view this release mainly as a bridge between the early, unpolished material from Burzum and the later, compositional masterpiece Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Vikernes still haven't quite found the right sound on this album, but he sure is getting closer.\n\nGet this if you want \"the missing link\" or if you're a big Burzum fanboy like me.\n\nStandout tracks include \"Key to the Gate\", \"Han Som Reiste\" and \"Naar Himmelen Klarner\".\n\nAs much as it pains me to call a Burzum release \"decent\" this is pretty decent. That, and very weird in places.\n",
        "\nVarg sure had a good stockpile of material set up for him, it almost seems as if he collected it for the sole purpose of releasing it after his imprisonment, but eventually he ran out. Since guitars are apparently deadly weapons (in their defense, some guitars could inflict fatal stab wounds) the count had to look to other methods to express how much he likes Hel because his brown-haired ass ain\u2019t going to Valhalla.\n\nSo, Grishnackh set out to find a new instrument, first he tried a MIDI keyboard and sounded like a robot attempting to explain the 2008 election without blowing up from stupid overload. Then, he got the bright idea to use more digital means to express himself. The result is Hlidskjalf, or as I like to call it, Rock In Foggy Forest.\n\nA ambient album isn\u2019t really that big a stretch for such a black metal act dedicated to atmosphere, and it shows. All the feeling of previous Burzum albums is here, and tempered by a new element, beauty. Listening to this album, you could just close your eyes and see the frozen land of Norway. Some of the songs are faster, some bombastic, some soft and \u2018feely\u2019 but all of them have this atmosphere throughout.\n\nAlso of note is how this album feels almost nostalgic. Varg may have some strange beliefs, but he really knows how to capture how he feels about the old Norway. There\u2019s a sense of yearning for those old times, and combined with the atmosphere, really paints a complete picture. Where some albums have a story, or an overriding theme, this one is dedicated to the capturing of an emotion. This is basically the inner feeling that Vikernes feels for the Norwegian past, and the sadness for something gone.\n\nHowever, there will certainly be haters of this album. If you think some of his other albums sound more like Varg doing vocals through his ass than the Norwegian countryside then you won\u2019t get Hlidskjalf. Most of the emotions in this album are felt through the atmosphere. If you can\u2019t get that feeling with Filosofem, or any of his other albums, then you won\u2019t get it here.\n\nIn the end though, Burzum fans will love it and the detractors will hate it. What is impressive is that Varg manages with this brand new thing, and converts the success he had before to an entirely new genre. You probably already know if you like this album, and if not, listen to some of Burzums other songs.\n",
        "\nDet som engang var, what once was\u2026 What an oddly appropriate title for this masterful release. Odd because at the time of its release, the title didn\u2019t bare any relevance to the state of this band, but as time went on it became more and more fitting. For it seems that Burzum will never again record anything quite like this album, Varg has moved on to new territories and it seems he isn\u2019t looking back. However, this is by far my favorite work of his, as the sound here a much more matured and refined version of the style featured on his self-titled album and the Aske EP and said style is much more of my \u201cthing\u201d than anything he would go on to do (That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t enjoy those later albums). This is what once was of Burzum, and sadly, what may never be again.\n\nThis is definitely one of those albums that split its critics into two very different camps (actually this seems to be the case with most seminal black metal albums). It seems that most people either really love it and consider it to be a turning point in the black metal genre, or they loathe it and boil up with rage whenever it is mentioned. Both of these camps are very hostile towards the opposing one, constantly arguing in an aggressive manner, violently waving their hands and stomping their feet in order to get their point across, looking similar to a debate between Adolph Hitler and Joseph Stalin in the early 1940s, except with fewer moustaches. The middle-ground, however, is rather barren, occupied by few who simply stand there watching these two radically different sides verbally tear the other one a new asshole. I, clearly, belong to the group who love this album. Although, I really think that this album is sometimes even underrated by those who do love it, as it seems that many people will admit that its actual musical values are nothing special, and the atmosphere is the only thing that makes it worth one\u2019s time. I have to say that I completely disagree with this. While the atmosphere certainly is great and makes for my favorite part of the album, even without it I\u2019d still greatly enjoy this because the quality of the musical characteristics presented here is top-notch as well. \n\nOf this album\u2019s purely musical qualities, the guitar work is by far the best. Varg uses a variety of different techniques, creating quite a few distinctive groups of excellent riffs and leads that are all different enough from one another to truly make the album sound diverse but not so much that it falls apart. Much of this album consists of rather traditional sounding chord progressions that have a clear first wave black metal influence, yet this seems to be forgotten by many of its critics. One can clearly hear the Celtic Frost influences pouring from Varg\u2019s guitar in songs such as \u201cKey to the Gate\u201d and \u201cLost Wisdom\u201d, for example. The most prominent techniques used here, and the one this album is most famous for, is the slower, \u201cdepressive\u201d (as it has come to be known) style. Varg uses this to create compelling riffs that truly shine by being as dark as possible; thriving on an unforgiving sense of dissonant minimalism. While these certainly don\u2019t take as much sheer guitar skill to play as the aforementioned first wave riffs, they are so skillfully crafted that they strike me with amazement every time I listen to this. Other times Varg takes the same minimal style but puts a consonant twist on it, creating absolutely magnificent lead melodies that flow through the songs with an almost indescribable beauty. All these styles contrast nicely with each other. The more overtly consonant melodies dramatically clash with the dismally dissonant ones and the somewhat lively first wave riffs with the \u201cdepressive\u201d ones. \n\nAlthough good riffs and melodies really mean nothing if they aren\u2019t arranged in the songs properly and, fortunately, this is another one of Varg\u2019s many strengths. He has a real knack for splicing these very different sections together in ways that still make the songs feel like they are logically progressing. For example, \u201cKey to the Gate\u201d starts off with some very heavy first wave riffing, providing a compelling intro that really grasps the listener\u2019s attention, before diving down into very dark depths, using only the simplistic dissonant melodies, which then build up to the climatic melodic leads that take the song to its end. While none of the other songs actually play out like one, they all progress in similarly coherent ways even though they are made up of many different, and sometimes rather obscure, elements. It is in this way that these songs feel diverse but not so much so that they become disjointed. \n\nAnother big knock on this album is about Varg\u2019s somewhat odd vocal presentation. He uses a rather exaggerated scream that is quite high-pitched and raspy, and at times, sounds as if he is actually groaning in pain. Some may call it melodramatic or overdone, but I really like it. It accompanies the guitars and the overall atmosphere of this album very well, as all of them are very passionate and emotional. During some of the slower songs, he also uses a deep, dark but clean singing voice, and this sounds great as well.\n\nAs I mentioned before, the atmosphere of this album is my favorite part of it, which is really saying something considering the very high quality of all of its other elements. The atmosphere contained within these songs is such a true expression of isolation that it makes this album a complete classic. Yes, while this album is playing one feels completely alone, and this feeling takes two distinct forms. One is, admittedly, more forgiving than the other but no less captivating. Many times on this album, the isolated feel gives the music a thought-provoking, philosophical, sometimes almost spiritual aura. The illusion of being alone, completely separated from society, secluded in your own thoughts brings this complex atmosphere to life. It may just be me, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve had any major epiphanies listening to this, but I believe that parts of this album can be very good for deep thought and reflection because of their isolative nature. Other times the atmosphere of isolation brings about much darker, heavier emotions. The sorrowful tones of some of the more \u201cdepressive\u201d sections bring an atmosphere of horrible loneliness and mourn to the listener, truly showing the pain of solitude. A sad scene of a poor, forlorn soul forced to live alone, separated from the rest of humanity, by some tragic event, mournfully weeping amongst the shadows of a far away, forgotten forest comes to mind while listening to these songs. This feeling of sadness and emptiness is past on to the listener and makes the experience quite moving. It\u2019s just stunning how incredibly powerful these beautiful expressions of pure grief and sorrow are. However, I fear that I may be making this sound a bit more melodramatic than it actually is. While the atmosphere that Varg has constructed here is certainly very emotional, it doesn\u2019t lack subtly, especially not in the way that many bands trying to re-create this sound do. This album gives the listener the feel of pure isolation, but it never over steps its boundaries, becoming some pathetic parody of its self.\n\nIn addition to the black metal tracks, there are three dark ambient songs on this album, all of which are of about the same quality. They all carry more or less the same aesthetics and work in the same ways that the black metal songs do, having that excellent isolative atmosphere. However, all three are constructed quite differently. But from the somber, slow-moving \u201cDen Onde Kysten\u201d, to the epic grandeur of \u201cHan Som Reiste\u201d, to \u201cSvarte Troner\u2019s dissonant industrially tinged soundscapes, no one of these songs are any less than excellent. All of them showcase Varg\u2019s talents for creating brilliant ambient melodies and deeply immersive atmospheres (both of which would be shown even more later on in Varg\u2019s career with his two entirely ambient albums). Although, I must admit, all of these tracks sound very synthetic, I\u2019m guessing the keyboard he used was of pretty poor quality. This doesn\u2019t bother me at all, but it may turn some people off. \n\nWell, I think I\u2019ve said all I can about this stunning piece of music. This album is, in my mind, an utter classic of the black metal genre, and it is one of my favorite albums of all time. Everything here is of incredibly high quality. The guitar work, the vocals, the song-writing, the ambient pieces, and the overall atmosphere; all the elements work perfectly on their own and together, creating one of the most engaging listening experiences ever. This is certainly some of the best black metal to ever be released and any fan of the genre owes it to themselves to pick this up.\n",
        "\nIdeally, this should be listened to at night, alone, in your bedroom, in the dark [etc]. This is the kind of music you fall asleep to. Of course, anyone in the \"mainstream\" population would say Varg's vocals would keep them from sleeping. Well, if you enjoy any other album (except his last two) it means you're accustom to his vocals. Getting past this is really important, and once you do-- you will thank yourself.\n\nThe defining feature of this album is the synth keyboards. Even through the first song, it would feel awkward if there was none of that otherworldly sound that Varg twiddles with. It gives an atmosphere of desolate nothingness; yet at the same time feels like you are looking into the space above. Back at the time where the 2nd wave was emerging, most of the band members focused on landscapes. This album could probably draw a portrait in your mind if you really want it to. In fact, I use this album to get to sleep sometimes, I'll touch on Tomhet at the end.\nThe first song can sum up Burzum basically. Crushing riffs, tom fills with Varg playing on time (yet he always seems to be off), and a beautiful synthetic background that I cannot describe with words unless you hear it. Actually I'll try. The synth sounds like the noise you would hear if you needed a soundtrack to a deep exploration in space near a supernova in a void.... sorry, give me credit for trying. The guitars are very fuzzy, and do not dominate at all. The lead is always given to the synth when it appears.\n\nThe next two songs are moreover the same. It seems to continue the ambiance, but doesn't bring anything special to the table as Det Som Engang Var did. They're still good nonetheless, and would be outstanding tracks on any album; just after the initial track... it seems like a step down because the first one kicked so much ass. I think these songs play a role into leading towards Tomhet. If you take a look at their function, they follow the same formula. The songs contain a few guitar riff spanned over a period of time. Since Varg's desire was to create an atmosphere, this is ideal in doing so... just I tend to find it too repetitive. He must be given credit for trying to add in special effects. On the amp he uses, he tries turning on the tremolo knob to give it the riffs a pulsating feeling. This generally cost some percentage since no deviation is done, and it almost feels as if the lack of keyboards is a factor. He does bring them in at random points; though they definitely do NOT have the same beautiful effect the first.\n\nTomhet is perfect. This is the reason why no one will touch this album. The synths were balanced perfectly in the other songs, but here it is pure synth. This song is for sleeping to, not to playing before a huge game. If you do that, you are stupid and should die alone. Anyways, I've studied this song a lot, only to find out that Varg used really loud synths at the beginning to make it seem like a clusterfuck of noise. Eventually, towards the 7 minute mark, it all drops down into this really space like beauty, which is amplified by the fact your brain registers a drop in silence. It's the perfect drop, and brings your brain down into a level of beauty I cannot describe. Now as much as I did say it is perfect, I am knocking out some of its score because it is perfect... and doesn't go on long enough. It ends too soon, and Varg could have easily drawn it out to 17-20 minutes and it would still remain as amazing as it would have in the 14 minutes originally. Sometimes I feel it is too short, even for a 14 minute beast of an ambient song.\n\nThis can only be experienced by buying and listening [at night]. An album like this has never been done, and will never be done again. The closest album to this is Filosofem. This is what makes it such a jewel.\n",
        "\nAt the risk of being strung up by fanboys, I must speak my mind on this one. I understand exactly what Vikernes was trying to do on this unpronounceable album. But I just don\u2019t think he expressed what he was trying to express very well. For example, with \u201cFrijo\u2019s lonesome mourns\u201d as it is said in English, or if you must \u201cFrij\u00f4s einsames Trauern\u201d, I felt\u2026 absolutely nothing. It painted very little picture in my head, and just succeeded at making me stare blankly at the computer screen for a few minutes. I picked up the booklet, and read the song\u2019s description (because there are no lyrics, just a booklet telling you what\u2019s supposed to be going on in the music). APPARENTLY it was a mother mourning the loss of her son. I didn\u2019t visualize that once when I listened to it the first time. I listened to it again, and only for the first 30 seconds did the music portray a mourning mother to me. For the rest of the 6 minutes of the piece, I had no visualization whatsoever. It was just so quiet and detached. Quite disappointing. I expected better from Varg, the genius behind \u201cFilosofem\u201d.\n\nThe best way to listen to this would probably be to ignore the description booklet altogether, and let it paint a picture in your head with just the music itself. There are bits where the music perfectly portrays these \u201csong descriptions\u201d. However, there are far more bits where the music just does not match, especially \u201cFrij\u00f4s einsames Trauern\u201d. \n\nThat being said, I reckon that Varg has done well, considering he only had a prison synthesizer. There were moments that were absolutely beautiful, such as \u201cTuisto\u2019s Herz\u201d, which all around created a very spaced out, relaxed feeling, and some of \u201cDer Tod Wuotans\u201d, with the spacey sounding up and down scales and the war drums. Also, though I suggested not to rely too much on the booklet, \u201cEinf\u00fchlungsverm\u00f6gen\u201d or \u201cThe Power of Empathy\u201d worked best for me when I actually read the booklet. This is untrue for all the other songs, so pick it up and read it just for this one. The song conjures a feeling of terrified pity in the listener, and I actually appreciate the booklet only for this song.\n\nShit bits: \u201cAnsuzgardaraiw\u00f4\u201d, or \u201cWarriors of Ansuzgarda\u201d. Oh my god. Horrible. Horrible track. For a few seconds, it plays quiet, uninspired, generic ambient, then all of a sudden, TWO FUCKING CHORDS. OVER. AND OVER. AND OVER. Again. It\u2019s like this for the entire fucking piece. If you thought the snare on St Anger was annoying, think again. It\u2019s like Varg compressed the entirety of everything annoying about that snare and shoved it into one song, labeled \u201cambient\u201d by the tr00 followers. Also, the mercifully short \u201cFrij\u00f4s goldene Tr\u00e4nen\u201d, with notes so high they would make a piccolo player wince. And also, as I have said earlier, a frequent inability to properly express anything he was trying to express, as according to the booklet.\n\nCrap though the resources were, a talented musician like Varg who produced such opii as Filosofem should certainly have been able to provoke better imagery than he did with this album. My suggestion is let the music, not the description booklet, do the talking.\n",
        "\nEvery time I listen to this LP it confirms the saying \u201cthe thin line between madness and geniusness\u201d, for I am not yet sure if Vikerness is a madman or a musical genius. The truth is that the music he has written is one of the most distinctive ever made in the metal.\n\nOne of the best groups ever, with the characteristic distorted sound and grunting vocals, Burzum released this album in 1996 and it is the last one recorded before Vikerness was put to prison. Bursum are a unique group, not only because they were something black metal had never seen before but because they put the ideology into metal, the pre-christian tradition with the ancient gods that died to the forceful imposition of christianity.\n\nMusically the LP is exactly what we would expect from a group like Burzum. The vinyl comes into two pieces (with fantastic artwork from Theodor Kittelsen) and is separated into metal and ambient sounds, more or less like its predecessor. Very distorted sound, gruntings, eerie and misanthropic drums and dreamy riffs that keep repeating with slow and very heavy sound. The music is not very fast (it is certainly slower than their previous records) and you don't get many speedy riffs, although Burzum were never famous for their fast music.\n\nI believe that the epitome of the LP is the self-titled song (Burzum or Dunkelheit in german) where the mix of black metal and uncanny keyboards is unique. I knew from the previous works that Vikerness was experimenting with keyboards but I could never have imagined that he could manage to tie them so beautifully with such extreme sound. They keyboards are so eerie that they create weird feelings, like you become one with gods, one with the distant path, in desolate and deserted places. Truly this work abounds in images.\n\nIt is an excellent work, icy and depressive, cursed and black. \u201cLife has new meaning\u201d as the self-titled song says. Burzum managed to take black metal one step further. Simply immaculate.\n",
        "\nWhat else could be expected of Burzum? Though Filosofem was a bit more mainstream than previous albums (and less in some ways, 25 min track of nothing i'm looking at you there...), Burzum in a 'Metallica- One' sort of way finally released a visual accompaniment for Dunkelheit. It is the only kind of video this music can or should have.\n\nStan Brakhage and Jen Reeves flooded the avant garde film world with this sort of thing, occult animation (In this case dealing with Runes, which are to Burzum as Iconic as Eddie to Iron Maiden) mixed with imagery so appropriate in it's dismal ugliness and gloomy tone that it's hard for me to think of the music without it. Nordic landscapes, nordic fauna, and nordic esoteric conceptual imagery. All shown in low fidelity grainy scratchy film to video that echoes Burzum's production quality, in desaturated color and sawtooth motion blur that also fit the sound of the 2nd wave of black metal. Even the box for the video is made of cheap pulp and covered by a sloppy drawn iconic rune. \n\nThe video has it's detractors but I find it to be the absolute Ideal. I heard it was dull. No more so than the deathly drone of the song. I heard it lacked live footage. When did Burzum ever play live? This work exists out of the regular continuity of metal videos just as Varg existed out of the regular video realm even of the already irregular genre. Any experimental film student will tell you that this video is on par with the finest moments of underground beyond underground experimental cinema. Watch it on a spent tape in a dark room (Or on YouTube, such is the modern expectation) and it will pull you deep into the mindset that Burzum is all about.\n",
        "\nThe second full-length release by Norwegian one-man-band Burzum moves beyond the primitive raw black metal of the self-titled debut and controversial \u2018Aske\u2019 E.P. towards something more refined, involved and emotionally resonant, an experimental balance that would continue with the next two albums before Varg Vikernes was imprisoned for the murder of Euronymous, his former Mayhem bandmate and producer. Released in 1993, \u2018Det Som Engang Var\u2019 expands the scope of Norwegian black metal, and is one of the most intriguingly unsettling listening experiences I frequently subject myself to.\n\nThe songs are mostly based around simple repeating guitar riffs and pounding, albeit rather quiet drums, all providing the background for Varg\u2019s screams and yells. As with all Burzum releases from this point onwards, the opening songs are more distinctive and perhaps traditional, moving between guitar riffs and featuring distinct verses and even guitar solos, while the later songs tend more towards creating a bleak and hypnotic soundscape to lull the listener into an evil black metal trance. Odd as it may sound, this is actually very effective, although it\u2019s more a case of being so used to the treble-heavy guitar lines and cardboard-sounding drums that they fade into white (black?) noise. The production values are genuinely rather low, but like all good black metal this adds greatly to the tomb-like atmosphere, and is at least genuine in these early 90s releases unlike some recent attempts by big-name bands to purposefully primitivise their sound. An example would be Ulver\u2019s \u2018Nattens Madrigal,\u2019 which received large funding from Century Media records that was allegedly spent by the band on cars and girls and stuff, before they finally got round to recording their album haphazardly in a forest. Burzum\u2019s raw production, heavy on the treble but not exactly tinny, lends a distinct buzzing whine to the guitars and holds up well throughout.\n\n1. Den onde kysten (The Evil Shores)\n2. Key to the Gate\n3. En Ring til \u00e5 herske (One Ring to Rule)\n4. Lost Wisdom\n5. Han som reiste (He Who Journeyed)\n6. N\u00e5r himmelen klarner (When the Sky Clears)\n7. Snu mikrokosmos tegn (Turn the Sign of the Microcosmos)\n8. Svarte troner (Black Thrones)\n\nThe Tolkein themes present in the song-titles and album art stem from Varg grounding his musical project in ancient Norwegian mythology, which he claims Tolkein took much inspiration from (the name \u2018Burzum\u2019 itself is taken from the inscription of the One Ring, and arguably means either darkness or light, depending on whether Tolkein or Varg is to be believed). Nevertheless, unlike many of the power metal bands influenced prominently by \u2018The Lord of the Rings,\u2019 most notably Blind Guardian, the influence is entirely absent from the listening experience, which sounds more like an elongated, torturous release of sorrow and hatred than any kind of epic journey across mountains. \u2018Den onde kysten\u2019 and \u2018svarte troner\u2019 are both fairly non-ish instrumentals bookending the rest of the album, effectively creating the mood but being mostly redundant, especially as the surrounding material jars with them completely. The album really begins with the excellent \u2018Key to the Gate,\u2019 easily the most accomplished and memorable song here in the tradition of all Burzum album openers, which blasts into uncompromising black metal from the onset before settling down slightly into a distinctive riff and crashing, relentless drums. Varg\u2019s vocals are the main highlight of this song, extremely emotive and disturbing as he clearly lets out all the grief plaguing his sad and ill-fated Norwegian life. This is no \u2018emo-core\u2019 angsty yelling, but a hellish cackle and wails from the heart that are all pretty disturbing and morbidly fascinating. The song changes rather abruptly into a very pleasant melodic guitar solo half-way through, which is slow, precise and premeditated... much like the murder of Euronymous (sorry, couldn\u2019t resist).\n\nThe album sadly takes a rather immediate down-turn after this point, as the songs become increasingly repetitive in the lead-up to the \u2018trance,\u2019 also seemingly requiring a major decrease in tempo. \u2018En Ring til \u00e5 herske\u2019 is based around a slower riff, dirty sounding like Black Sabbath, with distant, mostly chanted vocals as Varg calms down a little. Aside from the addition of subtle keyboards towards the end, which will come to prominence after, this song is too long and features too few changes to keep things interesting. \u2018Lost Wisdom\u2019 fares better, the last song of the album\u2019s first half and based unapologetically on a catchy riff and drum beat. Who said black metal couldn\u2019t be fun while it\u2019s being depressing and disturbing? Varg\u2019s use of multiple guitars, at least two of which can be discerned through the muddy production, fills out the sound impressively as they focus on different ends of the scale, and there\u2019s another great, slow solo (slow-lo is the term I sometimes use, but that always requires a long explanation in brackets such as these, so I\u2019ll stop using it from now on). Varg\u2019s screams are more animalistic/demonic here, which is a nice change from the very different styles of tracks two and three, and overall this sounds much like the opening song from the next album, only more concise and ten minutes shorter.\n\nSeperating the two sections of the album is the keyboard instrumental \u2018han som reiste,\u2019 the biggest departure of this album that takes it more into the realm of electronic silent film scores. The organ-like keyboard is effectively dingy and sinister, but also strangely pleasant, and the endless repetition of the same bars makes this one of many songs that are forced to fade out after an arbitrary time, when the listener\u2019s personal tolerance could extend or constrict the length with each listen, though hopefully not to the extent of the twenty-five-minute piano loop of the later \u2018Filosofem.\u2019 \u2018N\u00e5r himmelen klarner\u2019 is another instrumental to follow, but this time utilising the more customary instruments and allowing Varg to better demonstrate his guitar abilities as they take the lead role, though the song noticeably lacks a solo, which would presumably come at a cost to the atmosphere, and doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. The album\u2019s ultimate statement of hypnotic black metal, before this would be perfected with \u2018Filosofem,\u2019 is the grand and lengthy finale \u2018snu mikrokosmos tegn,\u2019 which brings back the speed and drum bashing but repeats to the extent that the whole thing becomes background noise very quickly.\n\nNo Burzum album is an easy listen, and it was at this point that Varg Vikernes\u2019 musical agenda started to become prominent, if executed a little amateurishly. The ambient nature of the later songs makes them less intrinsically compelling than the album\u2019s first half, which can stand strong outside of the dark magical experience the musician is so determined to inflict, and overall the latter half of this album sits rather confusedly between black metal and ambience without really being either. It\u2019s surprising just how relaxing, or perhaps boring, the album can become, especially as anyone walking in would effectively see you chilling out to the sound of someone being tortured, and as such it\u2019s an album that still fascinates me. Despite some peoples\u2019 misguided claims, there\u2019s nothing to be found in Burzum\u2019s music that is any way subliminal towards Varg\u2019s ideologies, which themselves have often been misconstrued, and the listener is more likely to nod off after this listen than go out and burn some churches or stab their friend multiple times in the back. If anything, this only makes you pity the fool.\n",
        "\n'Det Som Engang Var' appears to be a very cherished full-length amongst black metal fans. It's held up there with the best of them. Whenever a discussion rages on about the 'ultimate' black metal full-length of the early 1990's, 'Det Som Engang Var' always gets a mention. Burzum's support has never really dwindled, despite the fact that Varg is associated with so many negative acts. Though, I think it would be unfair for a fan to not support an act because of a well documented bad lifestyle.\n\n'Det Som Engang Var' is a national treasure for Norway. It signified a giant leap towards the infinite abyss that is black metal history. Norway are by far more often associated with the greatest black metal bands and the greatest black metal records. It's a country as cold as the black metal reputation, though in recent years the underground scene has almost ceased to exist. The acts of yesteryear don't cut it when it comes to the material spewing out of countries like Germany and France in Europe, as well as the United States, of course. Burzum's reputation was somewhat marred by the solely instrumental ambient works Varg produced later in his career, but as I said, the first four records are held in such high esteem.\n\nWhen it comes to 'Det Som Engang Var' I tend to feel it's a little off the pace. The two records that followed it produced a far better sound, the production suited Burzum's style more and Varg had matured away from this highly derivative offering. Burzum were obviously developing when 'Det Som Engang Var' was issued to the adoring fans, but yet, it's still highly regarded. To me, 'Det Som Engang Var' is lacking that something special which made Burzum what they are, or were on full-lengths like 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' and 'Filosofem'. The ambient style was just beginning to poke it's head into Burzum's music. \n\nWe can see this more clearly on such tracks as 'Han Som Reiste'. Monotonous keyboards slowly trudging along like we have all day to sit and listen. Uninspired keyboards ruin this particular track and don't really do much justice to Varg's musical abilities. Whilst I can appreciate this was a transitional period for Burzum, I simply cannot appreciate the content. It's primitive and pass\u00e9. Though I suspect for the time it was widely accepted as a phenomenal addition. Time hasn't favoured some of Burzum's material on 'Det Som Engang Var'. It feels somewhat jaded, especially the production.\n\n'Det Som Engang Var' is oddly enough one of the most original Burzum full-lengths, though. It's not as repetitive as everything else Burzum have created. The leads do tend to repeat themselves a bit, but not as much as one would expect. The percussion is often simple blast beats, but when it does alter, it's effectively hard and harsh in sound. The production helps give this cold feel to the music and it's hazy. The vocals are far more used on 'Det Som Engang Var' than the two records that followed it. Vocals are an important part of black metal if you're trying for a largely distant atmospheric sound.\n\nVarg's rasping vocals achieve this well, but they need improving, which they did do after this record. When the vocals change to a more operatic clean form, I get rather confused. They don't suit Burzum's bleak atmospheric tendencies, although they do form a good partnership with the lead guitar. Ambiance is just beginning to make it's way into Burzum's music, and not to great effect. It's rather weak at this moment in time, but it does improve. However, we're focusing on this work, not what came after it.\n",
        "\nSo, for me this album could be considered the album that suffers from inconsistency more than any album I have heard. Never have I been so absolutely in love the first half an album and at the same time despised the latter half although with such a difference between the 2 sides it seems as no real surprise that that could be a possibility here. \n\nSo, the first half is the Burzum I love; heavy, atmospheric and actually better than I have ever heard him before. The album takes off with \u201cDunkelheit\u201d which is a very slow and mean song to say the least. The riffing might seem pretty generic (same for the drumming) but somehow it really is a fantastic song which atmosphere is well translated in the video he made for it. Jesus\u2019 tod is my favourite song on the album and probably my favourite Burzum song as well. It\u2019s fast, aggressive and contains the best riffs I have by Varg so far. And Erblicket Die Tochter Des Firmaments closes the first half of the album also being a tremendously good song. The great part about the record so far is probably the atmosphere which is more aggressive than on any Burzum record. The vocals have also changed significantly to a somewhat lower and raspier voice in contrary with the high weird screechy vocals he had on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. Yeah, if the record had continued in this vein or had it been a 25 minute long EP, it would have definitely been a contender for best black metal album ever and worthy of a 10/10 but no because up next are 3 song that completely kill this album for me.\n\nThey are 3 Keyboard tracks which are supposed to be mood pieces that will get you in this trance. Great huh? Maybe I just don\u2019t get the brilliance of it or maybe I\u2019m just to sober to really get in such a trance, I don\u2019t know. I do know is that what I hear are 3 long pieces played mostly on keyboard which do nothing at all for me. Well track 4 and track 6 are not that bad really and the guitar noise still makes it worthwhile to listen to. By the fifth song however ,Rungang Um Die Transzendentale Saule Der Singularitat, I get so genuinely bored and annoyed. The thing is, it lasts for 25 minutes. Why? I don\u2019t know, but Varg must have thought it was an absolutely fantastic tune to listen to, so why not listen to it for 25 minutes. If you heard the first 2 minutes you pretty much heard it, since it\u2019s just a keyboard looped which changes perhaps a little during the song but not much. Great huh? If Varg just made the song about 3 minutes or just replaced it with 1 or 2 normal length black metal songs with the same quality as the first 3, this record would really get a higher rating from me, a much higher rating. Still, the first 3 songs are that good, and the 4th and 6th song aren\u2019t that horrible either, this album still gets an 8/10. This is Burzum at his best and worst.\n\nwritten for ww.musicmademe.com\n",
        "\nResources were obviously low for Varg when he created this full-length in prison, but still, it's not very good. The vast majority of this album contains very flat 'melodies' which are continuously repeated time and time again. This very fact is enough to put anyone off and probably rightly so. You can't fault Varg for attempting to create music. It's his profession and what he does best. However, 'Daudi Baldrs' is a poor excuse for an ambient album.\n\n\nAfter the last full-length, there was so much promise. Varg had just written two of his best works and one of those contained a far amount of ambience. This is nothing like that. 'Daudi Baldrs' is a subpar form of repetitive ambience. It lacks in atmosphere throughout. There are times when an atmospheric nature begins to shown it's head, but it quickly disappears again behind the monotonous repetition that is 'Daudi Baldrs'. It's lost in simplicity, to put it marginally. The full-length reeks of simplicity. Although that's an aspect Varg has worked with before and used to the best of his abilities, his limited resources are painfully obvious. There are a few nice touches on the keyboards. A mostly classical feel is washed over the music, so forget about purchasing this if you're after a black metal album. It does, at times, contain the sadness a black metal album would be proud to have covering it, but it's average nature is far too obvious to be looked passed. \n\n\nMoti Ragnarqkum, the very last track, is actually quite a pleasure to listen to. It's sadness and grief are portrayed rather well given the fact that Varg had very little to work with, but on the whole, you simply have to admit to the fact that this particular Burzum full-length is lacking in substance. There's no doubting the passion behind it all, but to have that and no substance, well, it's damn near impossible to come out without criticism. The truth is ugly, but it's unmistakable. This full-length simply has no legs to stand on when it comes to competing against the very best that classical has to offer. If that's not Varg's intention, then you simply have to wonder why he bothered releasing this. To let us know how he feels locked away in prison? I'm sure if I was locked in prison he wouldn't give a shit. This is just an attempt to make epic classical music that fails. It's warn out, needs to be put down and out of it's misery. Not to mention ours.\n",
        "\nThe brilliance and complexity of nearly all burzum albums is something that never fails to amaze me. The approach is usually quite simple, at least musically, but emotionally the complexity is overwhelming. There is something about Varg's music that captivates and grasps the listener, and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is no different.\n\nAfter fearing the first song, the title track of a previous album, I knew that Hvis Lyset Tar Oss would be my favorite burzum album. With a magical musical introduction, we as listeners are led into the darker, heavier aspects of burzum that we all know and love so well. The layered instruments on both the title track and Tomhet create an atmosphere that most all black metal lacks. Despite the harshly poor quality of the recording, the feeling and the intention to put the listener into a \"spell\" is still there, and is felt strong.\n\nAs the album progresses, the mind begins to wander as the music takes control. Unlike many burzum albums, the songs on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss are always a perfect mix of ambience and heaviness, dark and light. There are very few memorable \"riffs\" on this album, simply because all of the music floats in and out if itself and each track is merely a continuation of the previous track. This is one of the many reasons that I enjoy listening to this album on a regular basis.\n\nOne thing that I truly enjoy about Hvis is that it deviates from the standard satanist viewpoints that nearly all Norwegian black metal bands of the early 90's shared. Instead, the lyrical content is focused on things like myth, folklore, sadness, and gloom. These are lyrical themes that I can more closely identify with, which makes this album all the more enjoyable for me.\n\nOne complaint that I did have, although it is not major, is that the album is too short! With a total of close to 45 minutes of playback, it doesn't closely resemble burzum albums that came before it, which was a dissapointment for me. This is the only reason that this album does not deserve a 100% score.\n",
        "\nIt can be reasonably inferred that Burzum\u2019s music developed from the being aggressive in nature to becoming ambient even before \u201cDaudi Baldrs\u201d. \u201cFilosofem\u201d, as a part of this transformation is slower than its predecessors with a higher level of experimentation and is mellow in character. Hence melancholy is the chief mood in this album helped by the lyrics showing wishful aloofness. \n\nWhat strikes the listener first is the highly distorted guitar sound which at first sounds simple and abrasive. But closer listening reveals the myriad of riffs layered under the \u201cfuzzy\u201d sound. Hence the enchanting nature of the songs appears. The cleverly integrated keyboard sounds add to the beauty of the songs (\u201cDunkelheit\u201d being the best example of this). This goes hand in hand with the simplistic poetic lyrics revealing the detachment form the present reality. What is most noticeable is the change in the vocals from harsh screams to whispers which is perfect for the album. \u201cJesus\u2019 Tod\u201d is an exception being fast in nature and with slightly different lyrics (its about the death of Jesus). However, it is one of the catchiest songs by Burzum because of the chilling riffs and the \u201cthumpy -electronic-ish\u201d beats. Listening to the first three tracks reveals certain industrial sound. \u201cErbelicket Die Tochter Des Firmaments\u201d is another gem with its consistent beat and synth melodies hidden beneath the fuzzy guitar sounds accompanied by Tolkein inspired lyrics. \n\nWhat is problematic is the second half of the album which can be criticized as being too long. These three tracks (\u201cDecrepitude\u201d, \u201cRundgang um die transzendentale Saule der Singularitat,\u201d and \u201cDecrepitude II\u201d) do test the listeners\u2019 patience but do make a mark in the listeners\u2019 minds with the experimentation put in. In a way Varg has always experimented in his albums as there have always been such tracks in the previous albums. But I reckon this is where the black metal Burzum transforms into the ambient Burzum. \u201cRundgang \u2026\u201d is a highly abstract piece running along for 25 minutes. It seems to be in the same vein as \u201cTomhet\u201d in \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d. \n\nAll in this entire album\u2019s brilliance lies in its veiled complexity and its ability to change the listeners\u2019 mood. I think this album can be called as the black metal equivalent to Keats\u2019 \u201cOde to Melancholy\u201d.\n",
        "\nAs one of the most notorious bands in the Norwegian black metal, Burzum emerged from the darkest thoughts of abysmal misanthropist known as Varg Vikernes. Due to his extremely delivered taste of raw black metal, this self titled debut is perhaps the most essential record that one must have in their possession. The album kicks in with \u201cFeeble Screams from Forests Unknown\u201d which in my estimation is a combination of raw and aggressive old school black metal. At first when I was listening to it, this album rather annoying and very in comprehensive in terms of song writings. Unknown to me that Vikernes quickly became one of the most genre bending godfathers in the early Norwegian black metal scene.\n\n\nWhen it comes to touch the aspect of Burzum\u2019s music, I could only say that it is straightforward in \u2013 your \u2013 face heaviness. Varg\u2019s ultra ear piercing screams and savagely distorted guitar pummeled with insane drumming pattern have totally blown me to bits! Not to mention the undefined volume of his double bass drumming that really sticks out behind the music. To me, it sounds more original and unique without sacrificing the speed since it preserves the most authentic sound which could rarely be enjoyed by many of unappreciative listeners. I really enjoyed reading through the lyrics, as can be found in the opening track followed by \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u201d and \u201cMy Journey to the Stars\u201d. Frankly speaking, I\u2019m not worried about Varg ideologies or beliefs. Let them be Odalist, paganism or whatever it is as long as I could sense his ingenuity through the music he produced. Most importantly, Varg highly imaginative thoughts have been such a good deed for him to write the lyrics. My favorite track as well as its lyric is \u201cA Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u201d whereby the music is unrelentingly fantastic and its lyric keeps flowing with enrichment of mystique. While \u201cChanneling the Power of Souls into a New God\u201d and \u201cThe Crying Orc\u201d are far much longing and I wish the latter would span more lengthily therefore I could indulge with Varg softly tuned synthesizer whenever I feel like cannot sleep. Before I forget, Euronymous also did some good job with his solo in the track \u201cWar\u201d. It is clean and surely to pierce your ears even for a brief moment.\n\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concern, this album shall forever remains as one of my greatest black metal record. I highly recommended this album to add to your collection in which I think it won\u2019t complete without any presence of Burzum\u2019s releases.\n",
        "\nOrchestral. Neoclassical. Metal. Three words that will play no further part in this review. What we have here is instead a collection of half-finished melodies and malformed ideas that are offered up as ultra-minimalist compositions of Grand European Tradition. Given the liberating constraints offered by prison life, Vikernes has been able to escape the milieu of Norwegian black metal that, having helped spawn two undeniably classic albums from this solitary rogue, led also to his eventual incarceration. \n\nThe fifth full-length Burzum album, as this was to be, seeks to avoid the reality of imprisonment and instead struggles to become something greater than the sum of its parts. It barely succeeds. The rejection of guitars is just one example of Burzum's long history of side-stepping reality. They have been excluded entirely from this album; a decision made on the theory that the guitar is of unsound heritage. Truth be told, Vikernes will not have had access to the necessary recording facilities and has been forced instead to settle for tinkering on loop-making software and sequencing programmes. There is little to suggest that even midi keyboards have been used here: the mechanically quantized rhythms and note velocities suggest music created by mouse clicks alone. Seemingly to his advantage, Varg's (widely praised) previous album \"Filosofem\" was composed using a similar technique of multi-layering short phrase groove arrangements. Whilst that abstraction of electronica production norms into the world of harsh fuzz box black metal helped establish Filosofem as a pioneering record, the results on Daudi Baldrs betray a general inadequacy of compositional ideas and approach. \n\nEach track comprises between two and four separate layers, each layer voiced by the synthesis of some stereotypically medieval instrument. The predictable, formulaic presentation is, at times, excruciating in its naivety. Some moments are laughably twee, (Hermodr A Helferd comes immediately to mind here), as our tragic anti-hero struggles to mangle a meagre two parallel phrases together with sufficient shifts in arrangement and velocity so as to earn the dubiously-awarded title of \"composition\". Arrangements themselves are a purely binary affair: each voice is either playing its one phrase, or it isn't. No introduction, no coda, no elaboration or development whatsoever. That each phrase on each instrument on every track can itself be broken down to a paltry four bars, (where bar one and bar three are always identical), offers some idea of the level of repetition found in this work.\n\nNothing on display here fits that oft-regurgitated \"neoclassical\" hyperbole that lazy journalists use to label Vikernes' later recordings. The individual tracks are works of pure repetition and stop/go melodies: A motif ceases to be a motif when it is the sole element of a composition. The predictable and staid implementation of cadences coupled with the purely homophonic interplay from the individual voices robs the music of any potential for hidden depths within the melody. It lacks every defining characteristic essential to the identity of neoclassical composition (there's that word for the last time)! \n\nWhat we are presented with is an amalgam of the Baroque musical elements found in plainsong and the sparse, reductionist approach of twentieth century Electro producers. This curious juxtaposition fails simply because Vikernes is unable to navigate past the pitfalls of each approach. Baroque composers would avoid the endemic blandness of homophonic scoring by employing constant variation and ornamentation in the melody. The minimalism of electro pioneers was itself largely an illusion comprising dozens of layered micro-loops played simultaneously. The arrangements on Daudi Baldrs only emphasise the flaws of the chosen form by ignoring these essential techniques.The end result leaves the listener struggling to find meaning in a work of ambience that is, perversely, devoid of any atmosphere whatsoever.\n\nWhat is this album then? It is certainly not the continuation of previous Burzum music in either style or execution. It is difficult to argue that it is the result of progress and maturity either, given that the compositions here are woefully unsophisticated in comparison to those on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss or even Det Som Engang Var. It is also a certainty that, if you have acquired this record on the strength of Vikernes' earlier albums, you will be disappointed by your first listen. Some consolation can be taken from the fact that this album has not been adversely affected by the limitations of the recording process. It is difficult to believe that the ideas on display here could have been executed with any greater success in a studio environment as there are simply no ideas to begin with.\n\nWhere exactly does this record score its points then? First and most obviously, it is a document of one of the most dramatic sagas in modern music. The Death of Baldr, the archetypal hero; the eternal innocent, and the unsettlingly hollow and dead-inside nursery rhyme melodies offer a more convincing insight into the mindset of Vikernes at this time than any number of rhetoric-laden interviews or carefully contrived memoirs could ever hope of conveying. Understanding this record as the soundtrack to one man's retreat into his own subconscious explains those nightmarishly repetitive toybox melodies. The monotonous, single-minded tracks become sonic mantras, comforting in their familiarity. The impact of this album is subtle, slow-acting but lasting. As music, it communicates with neither emotion nor reason, but through the Pavlovian principal of conditioning by over-exposure. Having sat dormant in my own musical collection for a number of years, a recent playing transported me back to the instant when I first heard Daudi Baldrs. Here is an album that says nothing to your ear, but speaks volumes directly to your subconscious self. For this reason alone, it has value.\n",
        "\n\"Dunkelheit\" is one of Burzum's best. It isn't an excellent track, but it's manages to keep on interest though it's huge minimalism and repetition. It fades in immediately with a buzzing sound of piercing guitar which sounds like a dirty saw and then the drums comes in slowly, being hided slowly and then takes a real beat and flows with the guitar along a mid paced riffing and muffled keyboards which increases an ambient feeling within. Varg has extremely distorted and harsh vox here and fitting perfectly with the guitar. There are only three riffs (or so) within the song, but they have an interesting approach and doesn't gets dull due to small changes within the song. For instance, it's played along distorted vocals in one section, and clean vocals in other section. It's played only with drums, but suddenly the keyboards joins and adds a different variation...you got it. Simple roots but interesting building.\n\nNow for the video: boring, simply boring. It looks like someone took a cheap camera, travelled in Norway's forests and took some random shots of the view there. What the hell it has to do with the song? I always asked myself but never understood. In the first two minutes you think that maybe it has a chance to grow for something interesting, but man, this is simply boring to watch this video for more than a minute.\n\nJust don't search for it, it has a decent song but boring ass video which just doesn't fits the song, that's all.\n",
        "\nThis is not only one of Burzums best, but also one of the best in the genre.\nThe evolution from the self-titled to this ep is astounding on multiple levels.\nFirst, the guitar layering/harmonies are on a whole different level than before, the classic Burzum \"tone\" that we all know and love was first introduced here.\nSecond, the compositions have improved dramatically, creating the otherworldly almost anti-human vibe that reminds me almost of the first 3 Mortiis albums(!!). Varg creates his own world and his screams are the native tongue and he delivers them with a profound realism that is hard to find in black metal before or since. \n\nThe opening track, Stemmen Fra Taarnet starts out with the classic burzum \nbeat with a nice fade in and just when you get settled in, the unearthly screams rip into your soul. He literally sounds like he is either dying or wants to die, and thats pretty black metal(hehehe). The middle section is very nice with some very suttle keyboard touches here and there. Burzum is one of the only bands in my opinion that understands how to properly use keyboards to add just the right amount of background atmosphere, an almost swelling feeling to it. \n\nTrack 2, Dominus Sathanas, is an instrumental and a rather nice one at that. The opening riff is a prime example of the increase in guitar layering and harmonies that started on this release. Adding with the chants and non-vocal screams really fills out the whole song very well. The overall feel is mid-paced, and although some people really hate mid-paced bm, I feel that this tempo really brings out the best in the riffing. Imagine how terrible this song would sound with a typical Dark Funeral blast beat on top, that would be both hilarious and horrific. Not much to this song, but thats what makes it great. Sometimes less can be so much more. \n\nTrack 3, perhaps the best Burzum song ever written, A Long Forgotten Sad Spirit. This song originally appeared on the DSP version of the self-titled, and they took off that version(NO!) and kept this version when Misanthropy rereleased them both on digipack. The opening riff is simply mesmerizing, it drags you in and the screams possess your thoughts and dreams. The breakdown after this is my favorite part of the song. The groove, if you can call it that, is very mid-paced and has a nice overall sound with the well timed vocal deliveries. One other thing that I love about this track is that you can actually heawr the bass, which at that time in black metal history was definitely not the case. The rythym section overall in every \"metal\" Burzum album is always the glue that sucks you in even if it doesnt stick out at first, but there is some really great stuff going on back there, you just have to sit and listen. \n\nThe overall production is almost perfect and really fits the mood and atmosphere. It is heavy when it needs to be, and raw and grim when it needs to be. Overall this album is an absolute classic and a must own for any fan of norwegien black metal or mid-paced atmospheric bm in general.\n",
        "\nThe first, and most noticable quality of Burzum's first demo, is the terrible sound quality. Depending on the release media you happen to listen to, this can range from nearly inaudible drums to a hiss that is equal in volume to the guitar. In addition, the volume levels do fluctuate throughout the release, even within a single track, at times. \n\nIn some ways, the production of this demo adds to its charm and mood. In \"Channeling the Power of Souls\", the keyboards have an ethereal quality, expanding out of the background hiss and then retreating, once more, back into nothingness. \n\nThere is a fantasy element to this music, an epic quality. Eschewing complexity for emotional resonance, each piece defines its own space and terms. Ascending guitar slides in \"Spell of Destruction\" not only mark a shift in phrase, but accentuate a philosophical point. \n\nThis is the nascent artist finding his voice. It is emotionally complex, compositionally interesting, and difficult in its language. It is \"orchestral\" music played on primitive instruments. In every way, this first release from Burzum defines everything that is good about black metal, and sets out a trajectory for the new genre to follow. \n\nHearing this now, over fifteen years later, I am still amazed, and moved.\n",
        "\nHere we have the final black metal related release by Varg Vikernes, before being imprisoned for the murder of Euronymous. This album seems to be an appropriate ending of his legacy that he created with Burzum. The end of an era in a way. This release was exceptionally original for when it was released, incorporating much more atmospheric and ambient elements then previous.\n\nOne of the most distinguishing qualities of this album is the vocals. The vocals of Vikernes on earlier albums mainly express anger and hatred. While the vocals on Filosofem tend to express sorrow and pain. The vocals have a static-like sound to them, which was intentional, but they actually work very effectively.\n\nThe album is often divided into two sections. The first three songs are purely atmospheric black metal, all with something different to offer. Dunkelheit is a rather slow track, with a haunting feel to it. Vikernes even does clean vocals towards the end. Jesus' Tod is fast paced and aggressive, and the third track is mid paced in tempo. They seem to focus on hypnotic repetition, and have long periods without vocals.\n\nThe last three tracks are a bit different. Gebrechlichkeit I does not have any drumming, with only guitar distortion and keyboards, along with vocals. Rundgang Um Die Transzendentale Saule Der Singularitat is a twenty five minute long ambient piece. This track is composed of a few simple notes, repeated over and over with little change. While many will no find the patience for this song, those who enjoy atmospheric music will find this track great for self reflection, and exploring the depths of loneliness. Gebrechlichkeit II is the same as the first, without any vocals, and some other changes in the song structure.\n\nThe lyrics here tend to be about desire and longing, and incorporate much imagery and personification. Overall, this is a memorable release, and reachs out to all kinds of different emotions, just as all Burzum releases tend to do. This would be in my opinion the best overall Burzum album. We can only hope that future Burzum recordings, if any, are created in the vein of this album, as has been claimed.\n",
        "\nBurzum always has been, and always will be, a band sorrounded by controversy because of it's founder and lone member Count Grishnack. But regardless of Vikerness' murder of Euronymous, and his endless ideological views related to race, culture, society, and religion Burzum will surely go down as one of the greatest Black Metal bands in history, and this album sounds like their best effort to me.\n\nBurzum do on this cd what almost no other black metal band achieves. A perfect balance of keyboards and guitars, especially on Det Som Engang Var. The 14 minute masterpiece (arguably Vikerness' best) uses synths in such a simplistic and almost boring fashion that you almost begin to recognize them as part of the \"sound\". And that is the brilliance of the keyboards, they blend with the guitars and vocals, creating an extremely organic sound. They also happen to be playing some of the most melancholic melodies I have ever heard, all while keeping the inherent simplicity and repetitiveness of Burzum. Here is were almost all other bands falter that try to replicate Burzum's use of synth. Either they overdo it and thereby make the synths the primary instrument, or they produce the guitars so horribly that the synths clash with the guitars instead of blending with them.\n\nOn the point of guitars, Vikerness also retains his basic power chord and tremelo style guitar lines that he used on the self titled and Det Som Engang Var. The emphasis is on quality over quantity, which is a point many black metal bands do not understand, using the simple structures of Burzum, while forgetting that what makes this cd work is the fact that the riffs are all brilliant. All of the songs flow seamlessly, and the riffs are repetitive to the point that you can't help but think that the music is simply a gateway into one's own visions and thoughts, and that the music simply acts as a catalyst, presenting possibilities and ideas to the mind. \n\nThe production remains similar to the previous full lengths, and Varg continues his high pitched and tortured vocal style. Drumming is good and simple, with fairly good production. Guitars are hazy and misty at times, but never overly harsh in the sense that they are equalized too trebly. The guitars have a good midrange sound, and this helps with the synth blend. The synths also get their own song, a song entitled \"Tomhet\" (emptiness) that gradually builds around a solidary synth theme, building layers over time. The song is beautiful and at the same time melancholic, and listening to this you will probably understand what I mean by the music being a \"catalyst\" for ones own imagination.\n\nAll in all, this is the way that it is done. Copied by hundreds of bands, but never imitated at the same level. You have not heard the full potential of black metal if you have not heard Hvis Lyset Tar Oss.\n",
        "\nBurzum's first album is combined on this cd with the \"Aske\" EP (two tracks tacked on the end). Overall this is a very melodic early 1990s black metal recording which, apart from two ambient tracks, gives little indication of the trancey minimalist keyboard-based ambient moodscapes that would come to the fore on later Burzum albums but instead is very grounded in the mostly guitar-dominated black metal of the period. Anguished shouting vocals are prominent in the mix and on at least two songs (\"Ea, Lord of the Depths\" and \"War\") there are passages featuring squealy lead guitar.\n\nOf the ambient tracks featured here, \"Dungeons of Darkness\", is a good effort and the closest thing to a completely non-melodic, industrial-ambient sound sculpture Burzum ever created, and I only wish it was a bit longer (and a bit louder!) than its 4 minutes as it doesn't seem all that developed or complete. It sounds instead a bit like a long intro to something Burzum never got around to doing. \"Channeling The Power Of Souls Into A New God\" is the other ambient piece and it is a very subdued funereal track, not especially melodic or emotion-filled, but nevertheless an early stab at creating mood music.\n\nThe more guitar-oriented music can be very aggressive with really driving martial rhythms (\"My Journey To The Stars\" being a good example) even though the music sometimes seems at odds with the lyrics. \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\" describes a deity whose form is a sea monster, yet the music sounds a bit like a rallying call to an army with those rolling guitar riffs and very urgent percussion. Nothing in the lyrics says anything about fighting Ea! The music doesn't have the anguished high emotion and pain and feeling of aloneness / loneliness that would distinguish albums like \"Filosofem\" and \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" and make them classics of their kind, and a couple of songs on \"Burzum / Aske\" would surely have benefited from that emotion but on the other hand the songs here are enjoyable and that's something you can't say about quite a few of Burzum's albums.\n\nI single out \"My Journey To The Stars\" as the best song here, it has stirring and catchy melodies. \"War\" features thrilling high-pitched lead guitar towards the end and \"The Crying Orr\" (I think it's meant to be \"The Crying Orc\" - there are so many typos in the cd sleeve's printed lyrics) is interesting as an attempt to capture a particular mood using just a repetitive guitar-only melody.\n\nAh well, there may be better one-man black metal project debut albums out there but the majority of them have had the benefit of following in some other guy's footsteps which themselves have followed someone else ... and eventually all such trails lead no matter how indirectly back to Burzum. And Varg Vikernes / Burzum had to start somewhere within a genre that was still very song-based and melodic and which hadn't yet branched out into more ambient and noisy territory. This particular recording with all its faults and good points should be considered within that context.\n",
        "\nAll of Burzum albums, this one is without a doubt, the most powerful of all. While I enjoy all of Burzum's early work quite a lot, none have captured me as well as Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. While only consisting of four tracks, these tracks create such an atmosphere, unmatched by anything else I have ever heard. This is not an album to headbang to, this is not an album that can be blasted while driving. This album has a very personal feel to it, music one should listen to alone, and take seriously.\n\nThe first track, Det Som En Gang Var is easily the best song on the entire album. I usually don't have any patience for long tracks, and despite being fifteen minutes long, there is not a single second of boredom to be found here. All the instruments just are perfectly calculated. This track explores all kinds of emotions. Loneliness, helplessness, reflections of the past. There is not much else that could be said about this track. It's a slow and beautiful song, and flawless in my mind. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is much more aggressive and faster then the previous track, and is not as well composed, but is also a worthy track. It is similar however in that it is also very atmospheric, and uses hyponotic repetition, and can in some ways distract one from reality in a way, as if one were in a dream-like state.\n\nIn I Slottet Fra Drommen, from my own estimation, is an underrated track. It lacks the atmosphere of Det Som En Gang Var, yet is also very dispelling listen. This track also has very good structure, it relies less on repetition and changes more often then any of the other songs on here. The last song, Tomhet, is an ambient track. I had avoided this track for awhile when I had heard that, but I eventually gave it a listen. Despite not having any vocals, this track is a true masterpiece. Like the rest of the album, it also uses hyponotic repetition, however, I never seem to get bored despite this. It has such a powerful melody, you will probably wish that it never ends upon listening to it.\n\nThis album has all the elements of a great atmospheric black metal album should have. The music takes me to another state of mind, almost losing touch with reality while playing. It tends to make the mind dwell, and touches all different emotions. This is an essential listen for any fans of this type of music.\n",
        "\nBurzum's formula has been always the same in his Black Metal albums: three or four repetitive riffs in the same tempo for the whole song, average drumming and typical Black Metal shrieks. I heard too much that Burzum creates a unique atmosphere in his music, but all I hear is some monotonous power-chords and nothing more in his music.\n\nThe production is alright. You can hear each instrument pretty well [except the bass] and there isn't a mess or something that interrupt the music...but there isn't enough music, that's a serious problem!\n\nThe first song has exactly 3 riffs in the whole 6 minutes. It fades in slowly with the guitar which plays a single power chord and then the drums and guitar get balanced into a monotonous repetitive tempo which doesn't change for the whole song. The riffs are nothing special, just some improvised power chords which drags on and on and then some shrieks which sounds alright but...what's the point with that song? Nothing really happens here! It's just the same chords all the time and this is such irritating one. It seems like Varg took his poor guitar, throwed some power chords here and there and then wrote some hollow lyrics which sounds unclear [you can't understand anything without the lyrics] and called it a song! Really, it just sounds like an intro for a song which stucks in the same place instead of develops into a real song. \"Dominus Sathanas\" is a journey to the dulness in Varg's mind. There are no drums, the rhythm is boring as hell, the riffs doesn't make any sense and it drags on for 3 minutes...yeah, whatever.\n\"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" is the climax of the emptiness here. Dull riffs, dull vocals, dull drums, everything here is just dull, and the fact that this song clocks out at almost 11 minutes it's nothing more than a total goofiness.\n\nI think I gave this album a fair chance, I gave it more than 10 listenings and it's still doesn't attract me or interest or makes me feel something else than tiresomeness.\nJust stay away from this, ignore the name Burzum because it won't make this EP sounds better than what he really is... a worthless and improvised one.\n",
        "\nThe final album recorded by infamous Norwegian Varg Vikernes before he was imprisoned for murder, \u2018Filosofem\u2019 represents the peak of the self-styled Count Grishnackh\u2019s achievement at creating ambient black metal, largely because his project has been put on hold by incarceration.\n\nThe fourth album written and performed entirely by the Count, \u2018Filosofem\u2019 was a surprising success outside Norway, even reaching the indie charts here in Britain, clearly benefiting from the notoriety of its creator. The twenty-three-stab-wounds murder of Vikernes\u2019 former bandmate from Mayhem, Euronymous, tends to overshadow reviews of both these bands\u2026 including this one, clearly. However, this album itself is partly excellent on its own merits, and dealing once again with ancient Norwegian mystical themes and a dash of Tolkien, is free of any trace of the Count\u2019s political leanings. Still, I\u2019ve gripped you now, haven\u2019t I?\n\n1. Dunkelheit (Darkness)\n2. Jesus\u2019 Tod (The Death of Jesus)\n3. Erblicket die T\u00f6chter des Firmaments (Behold the Daughters of the Firmament)\n4. Gebrechlichkeit I (Decrepitude I)\n5. Rundgang um die transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t (Tour Around the Transcendental Pillars of Singularity)\n6. Gebrechlichkeit II (Decrepitude II)\n\nThe album consists of six tracks, and can be easily divided into two uneven parts on first listen. The second half of the album consumes most of the playing time, thanks primarily to the efforts of the 25-minute fifth track. Vikernes has explained that Burzum\u2019s music was always intended as evening music \u2018to fall asleep to,\u2019 rather than to headbang along to at a live show or club. Intended to conjure mystical dreams of ancient times, the structure is consciously designed to become more ambient and less musically diverse as the album goes on. To paraphrase the Count\u2019s own idea of how to approach this record, the first few songs are intended to invoke susceptibility to \u2018magic,\u2019 while the rest continue the journey into sleep. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the album ends up becoming boring, though in this case that\u2019s precisely the outcome.\n\nThe first three songs share similarities with more traditional black metal in their relentless, treble-heavy guitar riffs and raspy vocals, but with a more fully realised hypnotic ambience than anything in Burzum\u2019s earlier offerings. \u2018Dunkelheit\u2019 especially is the most spectacular, an incredible six minutes of repetitive guitar overdrive contrasted with plodding drums and a simplistic but engrossing keyboard melody. Vikernes\u2019 vocals sound like they\u2019ve been thrice-processed to rid them of anything human that remains, a radical departure from his pained shrieks on the previous albums. While not reducing them to the mechanical coldness of contemporaries Dimmu Borgir or Immortal, this effectively places them more subliminally in the mix, and prevents them from distracting from the flow of things. The two songs which follow continue in this same formula, but are less impressive as the repetitive riffs and melodies are less interesting, and can become noticeably overlong if listened to casually, rather than under the subdued engrossment the record really demands.\n\nThe two-part \u2018Gebrechlichkeit\u2019 that bookends the monstrous fifth track still possess traces of black metal, and conjures the same images of frozen landscapes and depressed pagans, but on a more relaxed note. There are no vocals in this part of the album, but the guitars and drums still back up the dominating keyboards, which have now been liberated from their subordination in the opening songs. Taking up half the album, \u2018Rundgang um die transzendentale S\u00e4ule der Singularit\u00e4t\u2019 is a complete departure from metal, consisting only of a repeated piano melody that barely changes over the course of a long twenty-five minutes. It\u2019s very successfully spooky, but the effect doesn\u2019t last out. If Count Grishnackh has been successful, you will be asleep by now, and not even notice how boring this is.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an album for black metal purists, veering wildly away from the frozen hellish sound developed by Venom and Bathory in the 80s and defined by Mayhem and Immortal in the early 90s, but it still shares enough similarities to be labelled as such. Rather than subject the listener to a torrent of screaming guitar treble, under-produced paper drum blasts and tortured guttural vocals, Burzum has always taken a more relaxed, atmospheric and existential slant, and for now this continuing evolution has been halted at this 1996 half-classic. \u2018Dunkelheit\u2019 and \u2018Jesus\u2019 Tod\u2019 would be essential additions to compilations of the finest Norwegian black metal, but the remaining forty minutes aren\u2019t nearly so impressive.\n\n\u2018Filosofem\u2019 starts off incredibly, but soon tails off into overlong tedium, even for an ambient release. Burzum\u2019s future releases will likely continue the formula practiced here, but with more interesting and diverse results. The two ambient albums he was permitted to produce in prison \u2013 using only keyboard \u2013 are far more disappointing, even for the fallen Count himself. However, his failure to report back on time after a week of freedom, and his subsequent capture in possession of a false passport and a gun, have extended his sentence somewhat, as one would expect. Where\u2019s the justice in that?\n",
        "\nThis is Burzum's debut, and definitely the least unorthodox of all the releases. He actually plays what might be called standard black metal on this one (though he would do that some on DSEV too).\n\nThe production is actually pretty great. Raw as hell, much more so than any of Burzum's other releases. The drums can have this annoying ticking sound to them at times though. You have to love Varg's screams though; totally primal, and never more so than here.\n\nSo as the title says, when Varg writes actual songs, and isn't farting around with some ambient bullshit, it's pretty good. The first three tracks are real songs, and while I can't remember any of the details of them at the moment, they're all good. And then we have some ambient crap, Channeling the Power of Souls yeah yeah. When you listen to Daudi Baldrs, god help you, never say Varg didn't warn you. After this one is a really bad song, War. It's short, but it sucks. It's like Varg wanted to rock out or something, but he fails. Next is some more ambience, in the form of the minute-long The Crying Orc. Pointless, and forgettable, as I had to be reminded of its existence just before writing this.\n\nAfter that, Varg kicks it up a notch with My Journey to the Stars. He apparently thought that the intro to this song kicked so much ass he would repeat it like five times during the course of it. Luckily, he's right, it does kick ass, and so does the rest of the song. So, following this great success, what does he give us? Right, more ambient poo. Except this time, sucks even harder. I suppose Dungeons of Darkness is supposed to give you the impression of being in a dark dungeon. It gives me the impression of being near a chain link fence during a hurricane. Really, just terrible.\n\nAs a final note, I'm a big fan of listening to albums, rather than just selected tracks. With that in mind, burn one of these that doesn't have the Aske EP tacked onto the end. The addition makes it overlong.\n",
        "\nAll right, it's not technically sophisticated and most of the keyboard playing sounds as if it's being done with just two fingers plus a lot of tape looping but in its own way, Burzum's \"Filosofem\" album is an advance in music composition for mid-1990s black metal: the repetitive and austere minimalist approach, the emphasis on dark and brooding atmosphere in the bulk of the album and on portraying extreme solitude and desperation generally, and the integration of synthesiser-based ambient elements into the guitars / bass/ drums set-up is a combination that was probably unusual at the time of the album's release though it is something we take for granted these days. Like \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" before it, \"Filosofem\" is a perfect illustration of the \"Less is more\" cliche: the almost ridiculously simple approach to song-writing, playing, arrangements and production has created an album of very dark and complex emotions, wide spaces and cold, melancholic beauty, and as can be seen in the reviews below, this can result in a variety of reactions and interpretations with the same track engendering feelings of peace in some people and loneliness or emptiness in others, and surely this outcome is what we expect of great albums.\n\nThe pivotal track of \"Filosofem\" in my view and the one referred to just now is the fifth track \"Rundgang um die Transzendentale Saule der Singularitat\" which is played entirely on synth and initially comes across as a too-long maddeningly repetitive piece with no apparent development, climax or resolution. However, if you listen to it a number of times, the track does change quite a bit in some of its details and the plaintive melody, repeated over and over with clear pure tones, has a trance-inducing effect. You can float away in a serene peace (the music can seem a bit New Age-y for some people) or you can be awestruck by the level of bleakness, emptiness and nihilism revealed. This is most definitely a track you cannot feel indifferent towards! \"Rundgang ...\" is bookended by two shorter pieces, \"Gebrechlichkeit I\" and Gebrechlichkeit II\", which have the same melodies but musically are different, the former featuring wild shrieking vocals and the latter being more keyboard-based but without any vocals: I see these tracks as representing two sides of the same thing, possibly ascent and descent respectively or vice versa, and when all three tracks so far mentioned are considered in their proper order on the album, I would say a ritual involving a life-changing transformation is implied here. Incidentally \"Gebrechlichkeit\" can mean \"decrepitude\" but according to a German-English dictionary I have, it can also mean \"fragility\" which seems more appropriate to \"Filosofem\".\n\nNow for the other three tracks on \"Filosofem\" which I prefer personally (I'm nowhere near as kvlt-as-fvck as I might have sounded earlier): \"Dunkelheit\" is a strong opening track and establishes the album's style straight away, with rough yet clear production, distorted guitar fuzz all the way through the song, strummed-guitar instrumental, dead-simple keyboard melodies and heavily distorted singing / shrieking that almost merges with the guitars. Having the keyboards and the guitars playing the same melody together shows up the contrast between the harsh guitar sound and the smooth, almost sweet tones of the keys, and this helps to produce a feeling of pain, depression and loneliness with a minimum of effort.\n\nThe next two tracks are more black metal but like the other pieces are still repetitive, minimalist in structure and trance-like. \"Jesus Tod\" is the most aggressive song, an emphatic rejection of Christianity and all it stands for, and has a blistering pace and rhythm to back up the hatred Vikernes feels towards this religion. After this track comes the embrace of Odin-worship in the piece \"Erblicket die Tochter des Firmaments\" (\"Beholding the daughters of the firmament\", that is, seeing the Valkyries of Norse myth come down from the skies to collect the dead heroes) which is mid-paced with a basic rhythm and a more resigned, even contemplative mood.\n\nAt this point we run up against the trio of \"Rundgang ...\" and the \"Gebrechlichkeit\" tracks, and I can now see with the hindsight of writing woffling reviews that (for me anyway) the album traces the inner struggle with darkness, the rejection of old and outmoded values and ways of thinking, the willingness to embrace a new ideology and code of values, and the consequences of changing one's ways. As most of us are already too aware of, Varg Vikernes himself more or less followed through on what \"Filosofem\" suggests and found that indeed, the consequences were life-changing and transforming but not necessarily in the way he might have expected; for him, I think, the inner struggle of individual values versus society values (and I am not suggesting one set of values is to be preferred over another - I suspect that Vikernes's Odin-worship is a cover for his neo-Nazi beliefs but that's my opinion) will continue and the consequences of that which he will have to live with for the rest of his life are still to come.\n\nAnd I guess this is the paradox about \"Filosofem\" that makes it a classic black metal album: it is at once a personal journey and struggle of a particular kind, and yet one we can all understand and relate to, so the album becomes an example of the journeys and choices we must make, and the suffering we must accept and bear when we make them.\n",
        "\nI think of \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" as a transitional work from Burzum's earlier, more purely black metal recordings like \"Burzum\" and \"Aske\" to the more atmospheric trance music of \"Filosofem\" which I regard as the best album Varg Vikernes has done to date. The first and fourth tracks of \"Hvis Lyset ...\", respectively \"Det som en gang var\" and \"Tomhet\", are forerunners to what Vikernes would do on \"Filosofem\" and the middle tracks are reminiscent of the earlier material and could actually be an extension of it as they are not very distinct from it. Even so, the music overall is good, there are no filler pieces here and Vikernes has put much care and attention into the details of each song and has synchronised the instrumental parts together well. The drumming can be tinny in sound and the rhythms it marks are perhaps not original or varied and you could argue that if Vikernes had employed a drummer or learnt to play drums himself, the music would improve greatly; but then Vikernes would probably not have explored the more ambient and consciousness-changing potential of black metal and Life As We Know It would not be the same!\n\nAnyway, it's unto the breach we go: \"Det som en gang var\" is one of the strongest opening tracks a black metal album could have, with a very eerie yet striking keyboard melody, full of alienation and (to me) the pain of being, leading into a robust build-up to the anguished and screechy singing. The keyboard melodies and guitar riffing may not be complex and the musical motifs are repeated throughout the track but the atmosphere is stark and despairing and the strummed-guitar instrumental sends icy chills up and down you spine. The drum machine is perhaps used at its best here, there are good rolls at the beginning to help create tension and then it takes a back seat to the guitars and keyboards, helping to push the track along and giving the flowing music structure.\n\nThe title track is very different: frantic in pace and more aggressive, the guitars and drumming dominant over the keyboards. Here the drumming could be considered a let-down as it is slow compared to the rest of the music and doesn't sound inspired in the early part of the song. The guitar has a very cutting edge that penetrates deep into the consciousness. The lead guitar instrumental can just be heard and is a flowing series of notes played very quickly and repeatedly to create a hynotic effect.\n\n\"Inn i slottet fra droemmen\" is in a similar vein, again fairly fast and with rhythms out of touch with the rest of the music at first but redeemed around the fourth minute by pained shrieking from Vikernes. After this point, the music seems to become inspired: keyboards, guitars and even drum machine start to play almost note for note together and the result becomes a kind of up-and-down rollercoaster that seems never-ending and mirrors the vocalist's mental distress.\n\nFinally we come to \"Tomhet\" which is an all-synth soundscape affair: the melodies and tones are simple but have a spacious, inviting quality drawing you into the sonic wonderland within. I don't feel lonely or empty actually when listening to this long track but there is a strong sense of \"aloneness\" so maybe in a way I haven't \"got\" the point of this piece. There is certainly a brooding atmosphere here. The plaintive melodies have perfect speed and timing, they are not too fast that you can't sense the space and feeling behind the tunes, yet not too slow that the atmosphere gets heavy or the entire track threatens to sag and fall apart. Towards the end, the flute-like tune edges close to New Age ambient music but the sharp and clear tone and production help to keep it cold and a little distant.\n\nI would say that the true genius of albums like \"Hvis Lyset ...\" is its simple and elegant tunes and riffs combined with a minimalist approach which provide the basis for emotionally complex mood music that encourages listeners to contemplate its message. No fancy special effects here! The synth-generated tones are as pure and simple as they can be and the guitars are played more for emotional and atmospheric effect. Even the production is clear with only the guitars sounding distorted to get the blizzard effect - and yet this is still a highly atmospheric recording! My only wish is that the album could be a bit longer with perhaps an extra track - but then Vikernes is not a man to be pushed too far, is he?\n\nThe CD artwork by nineteenth century Norweigan artist Theodor Kittelsen is appropriate to the emotions and moods of this album: the dense pencil lines and shadowing capture the despair and loneliness of rural isolation and poverty, and the mental derangement such desolation could lead to.\n",
        "\nBurzum has never been my favorite Black Metal band, as a matter of fact I find Burzum too often to simple be a bore or comically annoying. If such a thing as comical annoyance exists. Regardless of how I or anyone feels about Burzum, few bands within the Black Metal scene generates such a feeling of controversy or so many cult-like followings. The murder of Euronymous separated Norsecore into two factions; pro-Euronymous and pro-Varg. Now, you could make an argument that Burzum is only big in Black Metal because Varg killed Euronymous, and you\u2019d probably be right about that.\n\nIronically the biggest drawback and best thing about this release are the vocals. Varg\u2019s screams are harsh and sorrowful, there are many times when he sounds legitimately tormented. The end of \u201cSpell of Destruction\u201d is a prime example of this. However, when Varg tries to form words around this his vocals pop and crackle more than a pre-pubescent teen! The whole album is a prime example of that, but none more horrible than \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cEa, Lord of the Deeps\u201d. The cheap laugh that comes in at 00:56 on \u201cWar\u201d will give you a good idea of what I\u2019m talking about, but won\u2019t be more compelling than 1:22 of \u201cEa, Lord of the Deeps\u201d. It sounds as if Varg is saying \u201chruughrrrea rhroot!\u201d At 1:52 on the same song it sounds like Varg is saying \u201cahrhuenha enha hoot!\u201d You\u2019ll find that Varg rather enjoys his hooting on this album. Vastly, Varg\u2019s vocals are very laughable!\n\nThere are alot of very rockish guitar lines present in this album. Particularly in \u201cWar\u201d, but also in \u201cFeeble Screams from Forests Unknown\u201d, \u201cSpell of Destruction\u201d, \u201cStemmen fra Taarnet\u201d, and \u201cDominus Sathanas\u201d. Most of these lines consist of two-to-three string power chords changing key up and down the neck, simple stuff right? Well expect no guess again \u201cyes\u201d to be coming up, the guitar is truly minimalist. Varg doesn\u2019t even tremolo pick these chords often. \u201cEa, Lord of the Deeps\u201d is really the only song that features tremolo picking of these chords with only a few exceptions in other songs. The majority of the tremolo picking is played using single strings.\n\nNot even the guitar solos are technical or complex! At 4:04 of \u201cEa, Lord of the Deeps\u201d you\u2019ll hear a \u201cmock\u201d guitar solo which is essentially a background riff you\u2019ll hear through most of the song following the first chorus, the only difference is this time it will be louder. The other solo is heard nearing the end of \u201cWar\u201d. This one is faster and plays out more like a typical metal solo than the other. Despite the additional speed this one isn\u2019t difficult either and wouldn\u2019t take a newbie guitarist too long to pick up.\n\nThe bass just seems to exist, as with most other Black Metal bands. \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cFeeble Screams from a Forest Unknown\u201d are the two songs where the bass can be best heard, most of the time it\u2019s too quiet to be heard well.\n\nThe drums aren\u2019t programmed at all but actual drums! Something that should come as a shock for a one-man Black Metal band! The drums are also very simple and typically thrash/rock influenced. There are a few blastbeats but nothing lightening fast by any means. Also there are no real attempts at double bass.\n\nThere are four instrumentals in this song in an album of eleven tracks. The first one is a keyboard instrumental, it\u2019s unique in that most of Varg\u2019s keyboard instrumentals tend to go on for seventeen and a half minutes and this one only goes on for 03:26. It\u2019s also a fairly good track to be honest, it\u2019s simple, ambient, and provides a good atmosphere. The second is \u201cThe Crying Orc\u201d, which is a simple guitar instrumental features two guitars playing a very melodic line complimenting one another. \u201cDungeons of Darkness\u201d is an odd one, basically it\u2019s some random noise accompanied by what sounds like shopping carts rattling. Chances are you\u2019ll give it a listen once and forget about it later. The last one is \u201cDominus Sathanas.\u201d This one is fairly dark and heavily guitar oriented.\n\nIt seems as if Varg is attempting a dark rockish feel to minimalist Black metal in this album. Entirely different to what Satyricon is doing today, Satyricon is making Black Metal conform to rock while Burzum had made rock conform to Black Metal, creating two entirely different styles. I disagree with the opinion most people have on this album being ambient or drone. In this album the keyboards are kept to a minimum and the music isn\u2019t as slow and drudging like drone is.\n\nUnfortunately, it may have been better if Varg had gone with an ambient or drone approach. The album is boring; the riffs aren\u2019t heavy, definitely not \u201chead-bangable\u201d, and all too often you are left with this feeling that it\u2019s been done. Maybe that\u2019s just because I\u2019m a young guy and don\u2019t care that much for raw Black Metal anymore. The production is thankfully good enough. You can hear what\u2019s going on and differentiate between various lines and what not, but the guitar solos are played so loud they often give off alot of feedback which gets annoying. The album isn\u2019t a total loss; there are plenty of goods songs to be had here. Fans of Raw Black Metal will probably love this album, but hey, this is just the opinion of a young guy who doesn\u2019t think much of Raw BM. Feel free to come up with your own conclusion.\n\nFinal Score: 58\n",
        "\nOne of the unfortunate realities of Burzum is that Varg Vikerne's deeds and disposition has always preceded his music. It's a striking paradox that a murderer and social/political extremist could make this kind of serene experimental but minimalist and poignant expression of our interactions with ourselves and our world. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is one such secession from all things considered archetypical black metal, however we are taken through a tumultuous journey that arrives at a place perhaps more dangerous than good versus evil could ever be.\n\nAt this point in the evolution of Burzum, Varg had expanded the reach of his music, but at the same time had simplified his means. The format of black metal was potent in delivering a message with a certain emphasis to it, but aside from its aesthetic means there wasn't much finesse to it. Unorthodox production was a finite resource, and dark aesthetics, imagery, and themes were powerful if used with an aim. Aside from some striking works within these margins (the legendary De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, In the Nightside Eclipse being the best examples in my opinion), and other striking works that would follow, Vikernes was thinking ahead and saw that the genre had the potential to bankrupt itself within a short amount of time. So Vikernes took some of his familiar tools and composed a new palette for his next work.\n\nThe sound of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss bears a striking resemblance to 1991's landmark, Loveless--the crowning achievement of British shoegazer group My Bloody Valentine. The open structural format contains simple phrases fleshed out through a dissonant guitar tone, pulsing out thick chords that build strong but etherial and airy textures. Unlike Loveless, however, the phrases are stated but left alone to interact with organic space. With Loveless, the pitch of a phrase is bent and warped within an immersing production. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss widens its scope in acknowledging its existence and effect on space outside of the recording. The production values are clear and represent all of its instruments, however they are somewhat distant in the recording space to create ambience, an aforementioned interplay with space, and an organic feel to the music. The steady tempo, simple beats, and linear development are reminiscent of Kraftwerk\u2019s Autobahn. There is a definite destination and although the journey does not have any particular obstacles or surprising twists due to the fluidity of transitioning, it feels familiar and inviting. The sense of melody is still that of Burzum. It can be at times perverse, drenched in anguish, turmoil, but it deviates from the last string of releases in that it can also at times be folky, slightly bouncy, reminiscing of the purity of a long gone and simpler time, or it can be hauntingly vague, acknowledging both infinite possibility, or inescapable and absolute nonexistence. And of course, Vikernes is still his recognizable self, offering another tormented and still shattering performance. However, compared to other releases, Vikernes seems deliberately withdrawn from the music, appearing minutes into the music, and then leaving with minutes left to spare. It seems kind of expected that as Vikernes strives to explore other possibilities with his music, his vocals, not being very adaptable, would become limited and only used when the mood called for it.\n\nThe album is comprised of only four tracks, but all four are lengthy enough to put this album into a total playing time of forty-four minutes. The album opens with Det Som Engang Var (\u201cThat Which Once Was\u201d), a fourteen minute departure from serenity and peace into bitterness and anger as we are forced to realize the purity of ancestors has been forgotten and forsaken by time. The song opens with a serene pulsing chord building on its own dissonance and a gentle, wandering keyboard passage highlighting the shifts of the chord. The result is like being carried through a deep mist toward an unknown destination. The section ends with a short but very foreboding guitar passage, finally ending in a thunderous and anthemic drum line. Somewhere around five minutes in to the song Vikernes finally chimes in. The persona of the song seems to carry the burden of telling these simpler people it\u2019s time to move on--the age of their glory is now over. And with a forced sense of indifference, the persona withdraws from the pain of reality and shuffles on through this meaningless existence toward somewhere undefined, not knowing or caring what will come next. Around the eight minute a striking but still airy and ambient guitar passage repeats the verse phrase, with a subtle almost subsonic emphasis from the keyboards slowly increasing in volume, creating a body to the passage which makes the simple harmony between all three instruments (one guitar, two keyboards) befittingly grandiose. The section that follows seems to lack resolution or certainty, until a minute before the song ends, and an almost conflicted sense of momentum and duty carries us through to the song\u2019s end, perhaps suggesting the track should draw on more with its lamentation.\n\nRegardless, the next place we arrive is not a pretty one. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss (\u201cIf the Light Takes Us\u201d) is one of the most visceral cuts of the album. Where the last track was sorrowful, this one is full of anguish and torment. We are taken to a place of conflict and turmoil, where opposites do not exist with harmony, but where one has a disgust and contempt for the other. Vikernes in his time has written plenty about dark, shadowy figures and beings. But they are not always foreboding for the reasons we think they are--they seem to hide the ill intentions of what we perceive as good rather than any ill intentions of themselves. They have always had a quaint sense of virtue and peace about them. In this track these beings seem to live out the pain and punishment of their existence--not as those who seek to perpetrate evil, but as those who have contradicted the establishment. The track carries on for eight minutes with a single chord progression over a violent tempo, played loosely and then deconstructed.\n\nInn I Slottet Fra Drommen (Into the Castle of the Dream) begins with a masculine building of energy but in time descends into a plane of existence more or less similar to the previous in its aimlessness. However the blasting tempo of the song seems to carry us through to a place of more intense suffering and conflict, highlighted by sharp tremolo runs on the verse, instead of the agonizing purgatory of the previous track. The persona of the song seems to watch as a Lord leads his people away from the light of the world, away from the suffering of the forest, to their own promised place. The time of coexistence has either passed or never existed, and the time to establish their own place in this world of perverse and deceptive good has finally come. The song rises to a majestic note through darker melodies, and we are met with an ending to the song that suggests some kind of success or resolution.\n\nOr does it? \n\nIn one final and masterful commentary perhaps on life itself, Vikernes ends this saga with Tomhet (\u201cEmptiness\u201d). It\u2019s a vast and immense fourteen minute keyboard piece that brings no resolution, but the realization that nothing absolute has truly existed in this tale. We are taken to a place free of light or dark, where infinite possibility is suggested for the first six minutes, and then with a slow shift of mood, taken to a place of longing, a place where their souls demand some sort of absolute value and purpose to their life of struggle, only to be unanswered and then returned to the void. It is perhaps one of the most dangerously potent works of nihilism--the belief that there exists no true value or absolutes in life, only what has been suggested and accepted by those seeking purpose and meaning. It is both a declaration of freedom and one of futility, depending on how you have lived your life.\n\nOn this album Vikernes breaks free from black metal\u2019s limitations by exploring fundamental simplicities in a manner modern music seems unwilling to acknowledge, and reaches a conclusion about life we are all as equally unwilling to acknowledge. And the great tragedy of this work is that not only has the removed observer watched as a people struggle to find a truth that never existed, but much in the same fashion we will all probably live out our lives seeking desperately to disprove what seems to be the most logical conclusion of our existence. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is perhaps an album every one should hear and own, but it is an album only few of can fully understand the grave implications thereof.\n",
        "\nWhilst discussing the so-called classic albums of the original Norwegian Black Metal period, many people look at the first three Burzum albums (\u201cBurzum / Aske\u201d, Det Som Engang Var\u201d and \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d) as prime examples of ingenuity within the scene, alongside albums like Mayhem\u2019s \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d and Darkthrone\u2019s \u201cTransilvanian Hunger\u201d for examples. However, most fans of the genre regrettably tend to overlook Burzum\u2019s fourth studio album, \u201cFilosofem\u201d. Released after the infamous imprisonment of Varg Vikernes, the sole member of the band, it remains a mystery whether or not he was actually satisfied with the final outcome of these recordings, as he never heard the final masters.\n\nIt is safe to say that this is a Burzum album like no other; an album that could perhaps be seen as a transitional piece between the harsh, primitive Black Metal of the first three albums and the two Black Ambient subsequent albums, recorded during Vikernes\u2019 incarceration. Opening with the slow paced \u201cDunkelheit\u201d, it is immediately palpable that the Burzum sound has changed rather drastically, with a far more severe guitar sound resonating around simple, yet extremely haunting, keyboard passages. Vikernes\u2019 drumming is also far more stripped down than on previous efforts, certainly highlighting his growing yearning to create an austere atmosphere rather than to concentrate exclusively on extremity. The vocal performance throughout the album is also altered, with a far more distorted, forthright sound as opposed to the notorious veiled shrieking of the Burzum main man. Furthermore, the poignant ambience of the opening track is accentuated as Vikernes\u2019 fractured spoken voice utters the words, \u2018When night falls, she cloaks the world in impenetrable darkness. A chill rises from the soil and contaminates the air. Suddenly, life has new meaning.\u2019 The words, although straightforward, almost expose the troubled soul of Varg Vikernes who appears to be using this album as a method of venting his anxieties and utter dissatisfaction of existence.\n\nThe following tracks, \u201cJesus\u2019 Tod\u201d and \u201cErblicket Die T\u00f6chter Des Firmaments\u201d, continue this path of raw, yet most definitely evocative, Black Metal song structures. A true sense of aggravation and agony can be felt through the feral but daunting antagonism throughout these tracks and, although sounding quite dissimilar to earlier material, the mood created is still entirely effective. However, this ambiance changes quite dramatically during the latter tracks of \u201cFilosofem\u201d, especially during \u201cGebrechlichkeit I\u201d and \u201cGebrechlichkeit II\u201d; two exceedingly long Black Ambient compositions using only synthetic effects and Varg\u2019s tortured screams to achieve an almost primordial aura of misanthropy and terror.\n\nWith \u201cFilosofem\u201d, Burzum began moving in a somewhat different and chaotic direction, possibly as the mind of Vikernes became more and more disturbed and depressive. Nonetheless, experimentation here led to a fantastically melancholy and despondent masterpiece...and perhaps the last ever relevant Burzum album.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nUnfortunately, it is almost impossible to mention the name Burzum without the adverse and decisively tactless ideological outlooks of the project\u2019s creator Varg Vikernes becoming the subject of concern and debate. However, before his infamous imprisonment and the following enhancement of his extreme fascist viewpoints, the man more often known as Count Grishnackh was creating some of the most inspired and evocative music ever known in the Black Metal genre. His undeniable creativity, paired with an overriding sense of originality and experimentalism, perhaps reached a pinnacle with the release of \u201cHvis Lyset Tar Oss\u201d, Burzum\u2019s third full-length album.\n\nThe epic \u201cDet Som En Gang Var\u201d opens the album, with its strained ambience resonating immediately from both the ghostlike keyboard melody and the considerably subdued, yet harshly distorted, guitar tones. The extensive, although never overly dominant, utilisation of keyboards throughout the album to create a more chilling atmosphere than on previous releases is instantly perceptible. Furthermore, as the drums eventually kick in along with the simplistic but powerful main guitar riff, the true purpose of this album becomes noticeable- to produce a defiantly mid-paced yet wholly unsettling atmosphere within these four lengthy tracks. Vikernes\u2019 vocals are as harsh and unrelenting as on previous Burzum releases but they are this time the accompaniment to music which portrays a far deeper and more intense environment. The virtually minimalist composition of this opening track, lasting over fourteen minutes, draws the listener directly into the album from the onset and the particularly simplistic keyboard melodies seem almost to lead the song through its dark and disconcerting mood.\n\nThe subsequent title track wastes no time in continuing this dejected atmosphere, starting with an indefatigable blast beat, but over eight minutes develops more restrained keyboard complements and various guitar tracks blending with one another almost discreetly amidst what becomes a solid mid-paced drum pattern. Again, Vikernes\u2019 fierce vocals are more of an auxiliary function, practically hidden behind this wall of Black Metal sound as if he is trying to convey a sense of confinement and the subsequent desperation which has become a part of his temperament. \u201cInn I Slottet Fra Droemmen\u201d has more of the chaotic nature of earlier Burzum work prevalent throughout, with faster drums and some more simplified guitar riffs, but still manages to break off into elongated passages of despair and sorrow with perhaps the best vocal performances on the album, again emphasising this one man\u2019s apparent struggle to accept humanity and the banality of existence.\n\nClosing track \u201cTomhet\u201d is a fully instrumental track utilising keyboards and synthesizers, hinting at a more experimental musical path which would be more closely followed and certainly bettered on 1996\u2019s \u201cFilosofem\u201d album but it is nonetheless fitting closure to an album which created one of the most dark and aggressive atmospheres ever experienced within the Black Metal genre.\n\nUltimately, it is questionable whether anyone will ever be able to improve upon the epic moods portrayed throughout this undeniably fundamental work of art.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nBurzum's Filosofem is an album with some interesting circumstances behind it. While it was released in 1996, most of the songs were actually written several years earlier, with \"Dunkleheit\" being the first song Varg ever wrote for his project. The album was also released after Varg had already been imprisoned for his notorious crimes; in fact, to this day he has never heard the final version of the album. Perhaps most suprisingly, the album was about as popular as a black metal release can be outside of metal circles; it made it onto the indie charts in the U.K. and Norway, and a shortened version of the monster ambient track \"Rundtg\u00e5ing av Den Transcendentale Egenhetens St\u00f8tte\" was included on the soundtrack for the movie Gummo. But most importantly of all, Filosofem is an incredible album, definately the best of Burzum's career and a landmark black metal release in general. \n\nFilosfem marks some notable changes in the patented Burzum sound. Varg's production is jagged and extremely distorted, giving the songs quite a razor-sharp feel that can take getting used to. Most noticeable are the changes made to Varg's vocals; his uniquely tortured screeches have been modified with the same copious amounts of distortion, significantly altering their sound and role in the songs. Depeding on where you stand on the vocals of Vikernes, this can be a good or bad thing. Some would argue that his voice has lost its feeling of intense misery and anguish, and while I agree to a certain extent, I think that given the way the music sounds, the new vocals fit better for this specific album. It's really up to you to decide which you like best. \n\nUnlike the (in my opinion, of course) one-hit-wonder that was Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, Filosofem is pretty much excellent all the way through, though some people may not have the taste or patience for the final three tracks. Even if that is the case, this is still a mandatory buy for the first half of the album alone. \"Dunkelheit\", \"Jesus' Tod\", and \"Erblicket die T\u00f6chter des Firmaments\" are easily three of the best songs Varg has ever written. \"Dunkelheit\", the first ever Burzum song, is a slow, depressingly beautiful piece that, like all good simple black metal songs, ends up being way more then the sum of its basic parts. Fantastic guitar work melds with what may well be one of Varg's most effective and evocotive keyboard melodies, making for a song that not only oozes sorrow but also ends up being one of the more accessible Burzum songs (not in a bad way). Varg's lyrics are also fantastic here.\n\n\"Jesus' Tod\" is very different from the preceding track, opening with an amazingly sinister guitar lick before rocketing into probably the fastest song in the band's history. The drumming in this song is the best of Vikernes' career; a blazing fast double-kick beat that is maintained throughout the song's 8:39 duration. The riffing is also awesome, discarding the mourningful melody of the first song in favor of some truly dark, evil notes that are just fucking awesome. \"Erblicket Die T\u00f6chter Des Firmaments\" harkens back more to feel of \"Dunkelheit\", slower and more melodic. The riffing is again supreme; its clear that Varg clearly put a lot of thought into the writing of these guitar parts, unlike the stupidly repititive middle songs of Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. The imagery this song conjures is just amazing, even without keyboards.\n\n\"Gebrechlichkeit I\" begins the less metal oriented part of the album. If you were wondering where the hate and sadness of Burzum was so far, listen to this song. There are no drums (a strange but effective move), with the song only containing a simple keyboard melody, droning guitars, and Varg shrieking his heart out. This may be the only song where I think his old vocals would have been better, but the distorted vox still convey the most tangible emotions found on the disc, and contrasted to the almost whimsical keyboard notes, makes for a disturbing and engaging listen. While some may find the 25 minute running time of all-ambient track \"Rundgang Um Die Transzendentale S\u00e4ule Der Singularit\u00e4t\" excessive (I might be inclined to agree) it is nevertheless a great example of Varg's skills as an ambient artist, using subtle layering behind the main three repeating notes to add mood and dynamics; a great track. The only song that I feel isn't really essential is the finale, \"Gebrechlichkeit II\", which is really just a slight re-working of \"Gebrechlichkeit I\" without vocals. It's not really bad, but Varg's vocals were the best part of the first version, and without them this just feels kind of tacked on, and the album would have really been better off without it to tell you the truth. This is the only reason I didn't give this album a 100 actually. \n\nAll in all, Filosofem is an amazing album, the best and most consistent work of Burzum's career, and mandatory purchase for black metal fans. While quite different than Varg's previous albums, it's quality speaks for itself. Essential.\n",
        "\nThere's no denying the legendary status of this album, that's for damn sure. Varg's first full album, as well as the Aske EP, still has an undeniable influence on today's black metal. Both recordings have single-handedly inspired hordes of suicidal/depressive black metal bands who have imitated Varg to no avail, and has been somewhat of a holy grail for \"minimalist\" BM bands.\n\nBut clearly, Varg wasn't necessarily on top of his game with this first album. Some factors can be dismissed, such as the all-too-crude production, which seems to lack that quality of spaciousness and breadth that gave Det Som Engang Var and Hvis Lyset Tar Oss such a wonderful atmosphere. However, there are certain things which come off as an identifiable weakness: Vocal performances that seem forced or uncertain; a surprising lack of full-length songs or songwriting effort, which results in a clusterfuck of essentially useless tracks; (Ex: \"The Crying Orc,\" \"Dungeons of Darkness\") and an all-around amateur feel to the whole experience. I don't give a fuck how \"raw\" it is, there's no excuse for this number of drum fuck-ups. I realize Varg was not an experienced drummer, as seen in the playing techniques; but it's not that hard to keep a steady beat without fucking up in one way or another.\n\nBut, what this release lacks in the maturity of later releases is made up for with pure, juvenile aggression in tracks like \"My Journey to the Stars,\" \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit,\" and \"Spell of Destruction.\" Though Varg's songwriting skills and playing chops would improve with subsequent releases, the song crafting here is at its best with the opener, \"Feeble Screams From the Forest Unknown,\" which twists and turns through a myriad of primitive, rock-ish BM riffs and the agonized wail that Varg has become known for. While definitely not his strongest or best output, the reputation of this release cannot be put down by anyone. It holds its own for sure, but Varg would outdo himself from this block of amateur songs, lyrics, and riffs.\n\nI guess what it comes down to is this: The spacious, wintry atmosphere that made Burzum so great is not present on this release, thus rendering it somewhat inferior in my eyes. This is illustrated with the overtly garage instrument sound and production techniques, and a general lack of emotion seen on later albums.\n\nPros: Legendary status, long-lived influence, some classic tracks\nCons: Weak songwriting, general uncertainty/lack of organic nature in the music, sub-par production for Burzum.\n",
        "\nThe production and musicianship on \"Aske\" were undoubtedly Varg's best at the time. With this release his previous studio experience is finally paying off and this recording sounds a little less like a sloppy and rushed demo, unlike his earlier works. That said, there's really no reason to make a fuss about this. It opens with \"Stemmen Fra Taarnet\" which is a slow to mid-paced tune with more of a rock feel than most of his stuff to this date. The keyboard adds a nice element to it, but I honestly can't say this song is anything special. I like it because Varg usually creates a nice brand of BM that relies more on melancholy emotions and reflection than rage and hate (or worse, SAAAATAAAANN!!!) like a lot of other bands in this field back then. If there's one thing that I think should be mentioned and appreciated about this release it's that this is the last album before Varg began writing too many songs that seemed endless and horrifically simple. A lot of fans don't seem to have a problem with this, but it has always bugged the shit out of me because it just seems pointless to write a song that's 20 minutes long that consists of only 2 to 3 strictly average and generic riffs. The next track is \"Dominus Sathanas\" and here's where I start to have a problem with this album. It may not be the same for everyone, but I strongly prefer the demo version of this titled \"Rite of Cleansure.\" The album version feels like it goes nowhere because it doesn't have time to. It's pointless. There were many cool parts that were left out and I don't think the production really works with this one at all. The other reviewer stated that it sounded \"evil as fuck,\" but I honestly have no clue where that comes from. It's a pretty normal and subdued instrumental that sounds more curious than foul. Last is \"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit.\" I HATE this version. While the rest of the production sounds better than the original, the guitars are mush and that totally kills it because you can barely tell what he's playing in comparison to the crystal clarity of the guitar tracks from the \"Burzum\" version. There are also two other things I don't like about it. I don't like how when it first comes in one of the guitars kicks in before the other, or one of them is late. I'm not sure which. In my mind that sounds sloppy and suggests carelessness. I can't believe he would let a fuck up like that be right in the opening of the song. You may say that I'm looking into it too much, but with music that's supposed to be as deep as this it's hard not to. The other thing I don't like about this version is the first slower section. It sounds too slow compared with the original which was as perfect as it could have been, all things considered. I can't believe that this version is on the re-release instead of the original and superior version.\n\nIn conclusion I don't see what makes this so great. It has one good song and two that were done better elsewhere. One song does not make an album worth buying or praising. As for the cover... Would anyone really know what it was if they weren't more interested in the \"legend\" of Burzum and Varg than the music itself? Don't let the politics and crimes get in the way of the music, because at the end of the day it's the songs that make the album. I think \"Aske\" sucks because it has virtually nothing to offer. If you've read any other Burzum reviews I've made you probably think that I just don't understand this type of thing or that I simply have something against Vikernes personally. While I loathe fascists, that assumption would be totally incorrect because I feel that he was a very gifted composer, but he made sloppy music and had a few too many bad ideas which almost ruined his music and others that ruined his life. A shame. I'll give it 20 points for the first track and 5 for the improved drum sound.\n",
        "\nWhen one really thinks about it, 1994 sure was THE definitive year for black metal. Look at the albums released: De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, In The Nightside Eclipse, Transilvanian Hunger, Pentagram, Vikingligr Veldi, and last but not least, Burzum's Hvis Lyset Tar Oss. A pretty incredible list to be sure, but does this album deserve to be mentioned among the rest in terms of quality? The answer is a yes, but a shaky one at best. \n\nMany Burzum fans are divided as to whether this or Filosofem is Varg's best work, and while I am definately on the Filosofem side, I can somewhat see the merit for those in support of this album. Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is most certainly a special release, showcasing not only in full the man's burgeoning love of pure ambient music but also of his increased compositional skills, as the long track times indicate. However, in case you couldn't tell by my review title, I consider half of this album to be a complete waste, which on a work containing only four songs, is a huge problem indeed. So, is the weight of the remaining two tracks enough to make Hvis Lyset Tar Oss worthwhile? I believe so, but barely.\n\nThe album opens with the fourteen minute epic \"Det Som Engang Var\". People, this is the song Varg Vikernes was born to write. An eerie two minute keyboard intro leads into one of the most depressing, moving pieces of music in metal history. Varg's simple keyboard melodies and shockingly tortured screams send chills up the spine-I've honestly never heard vocals this frightening and anguished from anyone, and coupled with the simple melodies and drums, makes for an immensely powerful listening experience. His guitar mainly takes a backseat until the astounding solo at around the seven minute mark, a defining moment in Burzum's career, after which the songs slows down considerably, winding up with more haunting shrieks from Varg before finally closing on a suprisingly rocking Bathory riff. Varg's songwriting skills shine on this song in a manner that is without compare, repeating riffs and melodies enough to captivate but never too much to bore, and changing things up just when the listener begins to be able to predict what's coming. I consider this to be the best black metal song of all time, and one of the best in any genre of rock. You haven't heard real metal until you've listened to Det Som Engang Var. \n\nNow we come to the title track, and this is where it all falls to pieces for me. \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is honestly one of the most mind-numbingly boring songs I've had the displeasure of hearing. Varg literally alternates between one and two chords for an agonizing eight minutes, barely creating recognizable riffs, let alone any sense of atmosphere or melody. There are no keyboards at all, a huge mistake in my opinion, and Varg hardly utilizes his unique guitar skills at all, instead continually plodding along on the same two notes, while equally boring drums pound away in the background. Put simply, \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is a chore to listen to, and after the amazing emotional high one recieves after \"Det Som Engang Var\", is tantamount to a slap in the face. It's beyond my comprehension how Varg could go from the aforementioned brilliance to this early demo quality material, and personally, the lack of energy that obviously went into the writing of this song is inexcusable, not to mention a big dissapointment.\n\nNext up is \"Inn I Slottet Fra Dr\u00f8mmen\". While not as bad as the previous track, this is nevertheless another lackluster and boring song that relies far too much on extremely simple chord progression with next to no variety, and not enough on keyboard melodies or song progression. While the first five minutes are as substandard as described, the song saves itself from the level of the title track in the last two minutes, in which Varg finally throws in some effective keyboards and riffs and a wonderful solo to close the song. Not quite as bad as \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\", but still not nearly as good as it should be.\n\nThe album finally closes on fourteen minute ambient track \"Tomhet\", and on what a good note it closes. \"Tomhet\" is my favorite of all Burzum's ambient tracks-hypnotizing and captivating, without being so incredibly long and weighty as to be a burden on the album as a whole *cough Rundgang Um Die Transzendentale S\u00e4ule Der Singularit\u00e4t cough*. The song can be divided into two main stages, with the second half even including some simple percussionn to move things along. I don't have much more to say about this song, as there really isn't that much there, but rest assured that \"Tomhet\" is an excellent song, and serves as a great palette cleanser after the previous two cuts. \n\nThe lack of balance overall on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss is certainly frustrating, given that had all four songs been on a level even close to \"Det Som Engang Var\", this would probably be the best black metal album of all time, rather than a very good one. While the two middle songs are definately crap, I believe that the amazing quality of \"Det Som Engang Var\" and, to a lesser extent, \"Tomhet\" are enough to carry this release based on their strength alone (hence my relatively high score). The question you need to ask yourself is, \"Is it worth my $35 (the average asking price for this on Amazon or eBay) for only two good songs?\" Its a hard decision, but whether by purchase or download, just know that hearing these two songs is an absolute necessity. While Burzum would go on to release what I consider to be its definitive classic, and a much more full fledged and complete work overall, in 1996's Filosofem, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss stands as an interesting, and slightly annoying, look at what could have been, rather than what is.\n",
        "\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" ~ Burzum\n\nI can clearly remember the day I listened to this album. I was looking for new music to listen to, and I came across this CD. After doing a bit of research on the CD, I became highly excited and couldn't wait to listen to the CD. Soon, I had the CD ready to go and I started listening. The album is a pure classic that seemingly cannot be topped by anything in Black Metal, no matter how much is released. Though some albums may, and are better, for Varg Vikernes, this is his opus.\n\nHvis Lyset Tar Oss is just one of those CDs that once you listen to, it captures you, and forces you to listen. As you sit and listen, you tend to question \"My, how can anything top this?\" and then soon the question is answered by either a new riff, or some sort of synth notes that help to move these four long songs on forward. The album is one that creates a wall of sound that just pounds you from beginning to end with a bleak atmosphere, hitting riffs, and screams from Vikernes that tend to make you fear for your sanity.\n\nThe album begins with the song \"Det Som En Gang Var,\" whch opens with about a minute or two of a very faint, atmospheric guitar sound. This early in the album, Vikernes establishes the atmosphere as he begins to take the listeners on a the journey. Soon, the beating of the tom drums begins and helps to mold the song until the main riff comes in and makes the song it's own. Varg's shrieking joins in and easily makes this song a very memorable one for a Black Metal fan as this song just runs through torment and pain through a beautiful atmosphere.\n\nNext is the title track that ends up starting right from the opening gates with a hypnotizing riff and driving drums. The track seems to almost sneak up on you after the opening ambience of the first song. Varg's trademark screaming once more helps to drive the song on as the atmosphere is still not lost. \n\n\"Inn I Slottet Fra Dromemmen\" starts with a slow double bass rhythm followed by the guitar riff. Soon, the drums kick into a rhythm that seems to perfectly meld with the guitar riff even though it seems off beat. Varg quickly lets his voice join in with a surprising scream of total agony. That vocal work never ceases to amaze me in this album, and neither does the guitar work. The riff for this song just seems to fit with the structure.\n\nThe final song is the all ambient synth track \"Tomhet.\" Even though this song is very interesting and soothing, and helps to mold the atmosphere even more, I often find myself fast forwarding further into the song to the middle, where the song really becomes great. Even though this song is not an onslaught like the previous three, it still has it's place amongst them because of the atmosphere created by the earlier tracks in the album.\n\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is one of the albums that got me into Black Metal, and what a wonderful way to begin such a journey of life with a journey in music. It practically changed the way I looked at music. The album is completely definitive to the genre. Every riff is memorable, and the harsh screams of Vikernes will stay in your brain. Vikernes proves his genius with this album, his opus.\n",
        "\nFrequent requests and weighty opinions by several respected users of the Metal Archives, a few of them among the most profilic and trusted reviewers around, have led me to re-evaluate my original review on this album; I even took the time, the effort, and the eventual half-torturous discomfort to listen to this incredible piece of poop once again, in an effort to find any redeeming qualities in the sound, compositions and performance. I didn't find any. Actually, the experience was worse than I remembered. So, instead of the original, and inexplainably controversial, poetic approach, here is an evaluation of the album and its importance in prose. Maybe this is easier to read. After all, we don't wish to have our users dislocating their brains, or (oh, the horror!) simply passing by and ignoring a review because of unconventional gimmicks.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the album are famous: Varg in prison, only using a keyboard and MIDI to record his vision, bravely overcoming the difficulties and finally releasing the fruits of his efforts as the fifth full-length of Burzum. The alleged value, if there is any, is supposed to spring from the genius, the will to prevail in the face of difficulty, and the vision contained in these simple compositions. The occasional observer, with little knowledge of Burzum's earlier works, even less respect for the goofy Norwegian, and minimal will to listen to anything that doesn't either please the ears or make the head bang, is forced by the dreadful experience to question if those who claim to like the album haven't simply been mislead by the reputation of the lonely pseudo-philosophical dude in his cell.\n\nThe bottom-line is simple. The album is practically horrible to listen to, both because of the terrible sound and the too simplistic, naivistic songs. I can't locate a single grain of the so-called genius in any of the songs, and after a dozen spins, I'm no longer willing to torment myself by trying. Since the album is not metal, and it uses the approach of classical music, it should be judged as a non-metal album, too, and in that field the competition is too fierce for Dau\u00f0i Baldrs to survive much longer than an inept figure-skater in an ice hockey ring.\n\nThe music, in its repetitiveness, ugliness and simplicity, does not fly. It tries to invoke emotions, though. There are \"melancholic\" parts, some \"beautiful\" passages, attempts at something that can perhaps be described as \"serenity\", and possibly striving for epic grandeur. The main emotion, after all the cards are on the table, is just irritation. I'd expect to hear this as the background music in an overlong clay animation based on a Bulgarian folk tale, produced in East Germany in 1974. It would be of better quality, though, the folks in East Europe in those days didn't have a keyboard with MIDI, and would have been forced to use real instruments in the hands of a decent chamber orchestra or something similary functional.\n\nThe songs are essentially cheap two-finger compositions, and some of them keep repeating the same two bars for minutes. The simplicity might be an artistic choice; on the other hand, it could just as well be the result of fundamental incapability of doing anything else.\n\nMaybe the good stuff lies in the romantic approach to times past, the longing for medieval and/or mythical times? Maybe. There was a considerable nationalistic movement in Finland's arts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and that movement produced some of the most notable finnish pieces of classical music, along with some of the most famous paintings. There are hints of similar longing for the pastoral times, the mythical \"good times\", the age of legends in Dau\u00f0i Baldrs. But the delivery of those ideas, too, is stuck in the past, and such romantic ideas have been communicated musically a hundred times more convincingly a century earlier. This music is simply childish, and were I to seek the atmosphere attempted here, I'd simply put some decent classical into the player. This is a poor, redundant attempt that lacks depth and ideas, and treads paths that have been overgrown by the forests of time.\n\nThe music being what it is, a question surfaces and demands an answer: what do the people who rate the album highly see in this? Do they indeed listen to it with any frequency? I honestly can't imagine anyone actually doing that. Therefore, it seems that other factors must be at work in the higher ratings. Is it the legendary fame of Varg? Is it the naivistic ideology embedded in the music? Is it bright-eyed, unquestioning worship of something that simply  must  be worth worshipping, and the frantic subconscious search for anything \"deeper\" that could perhaps be hidden in these worthless songs? I don't have an answer. Also, I am most unwilling to attach any of those values to my listening experience, and looking at the Dau\u00f0i Baldrs simply as music, it blows a donkey.\n\nThe fact that the medium was minimal might work as an explanation for the crappiness of the sound. But it will not be a plausible excuse for the inherent silliness of the music itself. In the final analysis, the origin of the lousy sound should not matter, and should be taken at face value, without any regard to the reasons behind it; listen to the album as just another album, without attaching any non-musical values to it, and feel the bitter blood dripping from your ears. I shall listen to this no more.\n",
        "\nAnd so begins the twisted tale of everyone\u2019s favorite Nordic white supremacist Nazi black metal Viking Satanist Odin-worshipping incarcerated nut-job. Let\u2019s face facts here people. In the years since Christen Vikernes, a.k.a. Varg Vikernes, a.k.a. Count Grishnackh came to public notice in the metal world, this guy has garnered more spilt ink in the music press than he will ever deserve over several lifetimes of misadventures. He murdered one of the black metal scene\u2019s foremost architects (Oyster \u201cEuronymous\u201d Aarseth of Mayhem fame) and gloated about it, then claimed self-defense when on trial for said act, claimed to be a Satanist in his formative days, then claimed to be a Norse pagan, then claimed to embrace national socialism, and ultimately has marginalized himself as a self-obsessed violent narcissist who will serve many more years in a Norwegian prison for committing a very stupid act. \n\n\nTrying to chart this guy\u2019s guises and poses throughout the years is a frustrating and useless act, as he seems to feel the need to re-invent his persona in order to continue to receive attention every few years or so. But somewhere in that criminally idiotic mind is also the vision of some of black metal\u2019s most authentically bleak and somberly inspired sounds. I really can\u2019t bring myself to dwell to deeply on the man, so I choose to concentrate on the music he made, which some may see as irresponsible, but hey, this site is about MUSIC after all.\n\n\nAfter performing with some marginal death metal bands (Old Funeral) in his native Norway, Vikernes became impressed with the vision of black metal foisted by the aforementioned Euronymous. Said vision of dark images, wailing humorless souls, and faces painted in the manner of plague victims flew in the face of current trends and was decidedly provocative. Acting in kind, Vikernes formed his own one-man band Burzum (from a Tolkien inspired word meaning darkness, originally Uruk-Hai) and began recording primitive but effective recordings the evoked sorrow and pain at their most acute. The self-titled debut album issued on the infamous Deathlike Silence label is testament to that vision of anti-human music. \n\n\nWhatever his personal wackiness, Vikernes is a composer of emotional abandonment like few others. His melancholy riffs and forlorn sounds are almost without equal, the tortured wailings of a truly disturbed soul. It\u2019s rumored that Vikernes screamed himself hoarse before recording the vocals for these songs and I believe it. His shrieks are unsettling indeed, the perfect match for his mournful riffs. \u201cFeeble Screams From Forests Unknown\u201d is a collection of just that, alternated as it is over thrashing and alternately pounding tempos. \u201cWar\u201d conjures up perhaps the album\u2019s most obvious antecedent, Bathory, but only in spirit. Remorseful instrumentals dot the affair, most especially in the form of \u201cThe Crying Orc\u201d and \u201cChanneling The Power Of Souls Into A New God.\u201d The overall feel is one of bleak despair, and it may very well have been in this state that Vikernes future violent urges sprang. Whatever the truth, Burzum\u2019s debut is an unforgettable experience.\n\n\nAgain, the man behind the music is one to be kept at arm\u2019s length ideologically and clearly one not playing with a complete deck of UNO cards. But at this point, he had what was simply the most personal and foreboding vision of black metal music to date. This counts for something.\n",
        "\n\u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019 is the third coming from Black Metal's prodigal son, Varg Vikernes. Gradually, as time has gone by, Varg and with it Burzum has evolved into what we see on this record. A dark undertow surrounds the soundscapes of the band giving this record in particular a fairly mystical nature. The majority of the content on this record plays out it\u2019s themes using simplistic ambient tones produced by keyboards and highly distorted guitars with Varg\u2019s unmistakable screams of anguish, hatred and pain. As well as every other negative connotation one can muster. This record speaks volumes about it\u2019s era and the content itself. The very fact that, even by today\u2019s standards, this record has been and will be regarded forevermore as one of the best and most influential black metal full-lengths of all time. Even as the genre, with it\u2019s many sub-genres, continues to stride forward and evolve in it\u2019s pursuit to blacken our world, \u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019 will provide newcomers and old timers the ride of their lives to this day.\n\nA highly emotive journey through the depths of the human mind, body and soul is the attempted aim of this record and it is achieved to such high standards. This is an extremely ambient piece, focusing a lot of energies on producing entrancing atmospherics which are shown aptly in all the songs, not just one. \u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019 is methodical and very melodic in it\u2018s approach to black metal. Varg Vikernes, in when incarcerated, was known as a good composer of music, which shows in the assortment of ambient work driven forwards by the stunning keyboard work. Production is clear but unique with a slightly eerie twist. The sinister vibe that surrounds this mystical piece of music is one that still inspired to this very day. The ambient sound generated by the keyboards and the distorted guitars produces a distant feel to the music, as if you're gazing out upon something beautiful which is about to be destroyed. As stated previously, as each song plays out to it\u2019s close, you're left with the feeling that Varg has created a very dark, sad and angry masterpiece. One can only hope this is merely the beginning of what this highly esteemed musician and composer can produce, one hopes that there is more to come in the future of this nature which, he has said in recent interviews, might be the case.\n\nThe record itself consists of four hate-filled tracks which have been covered again and again by those influenced by this highly talented man. As time ticks by, the listener becomes aware of how important atmosphere is to this release. Atmosphere, in general when it comes to black metal is everything. Varg's use of keyboards become extremely important throughout. The glorious nature of the soundscapes, which often aims to inebriate the listener with influential textures and tones, particularly on the lead guitar and whilst this isn\u2018t considered the darkest record by the infamous Norwegian act, it should be considered the best. The keyboards create ambience which, even with it\u2019s own simplicity, is divine and melodic. Varg proves to the masses that simplicity can be as effective, if not more so, than overblown and complex music. However simplistic \u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019 may come across as, the complexities that dwell deep within the emotional content of this record overshadows the very fact that expansive duelling guitars, prominent bass and even explosively dynamic percussion sections won\u2019t often come into play when listening to the material that Burzum creates. This is however, as stated, emotionally complex. The intensity of not only the instrumentation, but Varg\u2019s typically rasping vocals don\u2019t allow for anything other than enjoyment when it comes to \u2018Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\u2019. One cannot explain how dark and emotional this record is, it can only be discovered through listening.\n",
        "\nI believe that this work is absolutely amazing, yet it takes some time to grow on you. I rarely stumble upon music that takes time to sink in, though this CD is one of those rare occasions where the value of the album grew with time.\n\nThe album opens up into an endless void, and the track beyond opens with a melody built on dissonant chords, yet ends up sounding decent somehow. Regardless of the dissonance, it is quite enjoyable to listen to. I was surprised by how emotional the track became the more that I'd listen to it. It expresses, with a voice of hatred, how little satisfaction can be found in the world. There is nothing to be considered \"fun\" in this album - just expression of emotions in pure forms. It isn't enjoyable to listen to as a whole, yet rather seems to be a journey through your mind.\n\nThe chants found periodically through this album really add to the thick atmosphere, giving it a dense feel. The biggest change of emotions is between tracks three and four. Track three is a dismal track, consisting of chants and screams beneath a guitar line. It moves on slowly, and seems endless. The fourth track, \"Lost Wisdom,\" starts off with what feels like a pop riff, and moves on towards a dismal droning of chords. It is an ageless piece.\n\nThe fifth track is an ambient track, recorded in MIDI, I'd imagine. It's odd, and sets an atmosphere for the sixth track, though I believe the fifth track to be weak in contrast. The sixth track is true sorrow. It was recorded before any other track on the album, and sounds unbelievably sad, no matter when you listen to it.\n\nThe seventh track is unrelentless, pounding, pure black metal. It's probably the darkest track on the album.\n\nThe eighth track ends this album in sorrow and emptiness, much like the first track begun the album.\n\nIt's quite the journey to make, but this album is worth every listen you pay it.\n",
        "\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is loneliness. That is all you will find here - a distant stare into nothingness, amplifying any feelings you had that you were alone in life. The opening track, \"Det Som En Gang Var,\" has this very feeling from the opening, which has a duration of nearly three minutes. Beyond this opening, which consists of a synthesizer and lazily played guitar chords, lies a war cry for solitude, expressed in drum lines focused on playing the toms.\n\nThe atmosphere in this album is startling, and this is probably the closest Varg got to his \"evening music,\" with the intention of lulling the listener to a dreamlike state. However, on this album, one can reach this state no matter what time of day it is. All you need is a CD player, tape player or MP3 player, and absolute silence beyond that. This album is probably most easily understood if played on a cloudy, dismal day when one is alone.\n\nWith \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss,\" you find yourself confronted with unreal, beautifully simplistic music that sets the perfect atmosphere, and almost instantaneously triggers a sense of melancholy and hatred within you. The repetition one finds in this album is used as a means of achieving this dreamlike state that Varg wishes to express. The shifts grant you nothing more than another expression of the same emotion - as though you're looking in a different direction, hoping to find someone else, but are still confronted with a painful loneliness.\n\nEach song holds something different. \"Det Som En Gang Var\" was the perfect starting track, and there is simply nothing wrong with it. It moves slowly through its shifts, with subtle effects found throughout the piece.\n\n\"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" is an attack using metal, and even though it lacks the same atmosphere as \"Det Som En Gang Var,\" it express the same feeling: Loneliness. This track is amazing as well, and I have no complaints regarding it.\n\n\"In I Slottet Fra Droemmen\" is a track I skip rather often, though I know that I shouldn't. It feels too... intense for this album. On any other album, this track would be acceptable, as it is a fine specimen of black metal, but on \"Hvis Lyset Tar Oss\" it seems rather off. However, it does redeem itself between 3:30 and 4:00, giving you a feel of loneliness and sudden disconnection from the activity found in the beginning of the piece.\n\n\"Tomhet\" translates to \"Emptiness.\" This track is simply amazing, and is best hear while looking outside into a dismal void of fog or darkness, allowing its three simplistic melodies to settle in. This track is unbelievably powerful in its atmosphere, and I can't think of anything Varg could have done to improve it. This is what I consider to be the anthem of the album, as loneliness can be found here in its purest form.\n\nBuy this album; I'm lucky, because I could obtain a copy from a user on Amazon. The new copies cost north of $20, so I recommend looking around for used copies. After all, the music is the same whether or not someone else has experienced it from the same disc as you.\n",
        "\nI'ven't seen Hecate Enthroned anything, but i did see the Immortal video and got a jolly good laugh....\n\n...wait a sec. Black metal made me laugh? Something's amiss. (The little bit of Immortal I've heard I find quite silly even without the ridiculous romping in the woods)\n\nThen I saw this thing. Dunkelheit (whose actual name is Burzum, but whose German translation is the much more popular name) is one of the candidates for Burzum's theme song in general. To me, it represents the contemplation of darkness (duh) and the \"grym\" (relatively) side of Burzum. It's good on its own, and especially well complements the song right after it on Filosofem (Jesus Tod).\n\nThe video has a 15-second silent intro with a wolf howling at the camera, during which \"Burzum\" and then \"Dunkelheit\" appear in rune-like letters. Then the song kicks off. It basically features fuzzy shots of Norwegian (i presume) forests and coasts, during the day or evening, and in the summer. It goes through some color filter changes, and the main visual attraction (besides the effectively shot forests) is the drawing of Old Norse runes on stone, parchment, whatever. We never see any people, and the only thing besides the runes, the sky, the sea, and the forests is the wolf at the beginning. Music videos are supposed to draw the viewer/listener deeper into the song, and I've seen music videos that I liked, only to discover that the video alone and the song alone were crappy. This one has a decent video and a good song that combine to make a really good music video. I got more into the song while watching it.\n\nBut it seems slightly misplaced, in that Dunkelheit (the song) to me seems dark and grym, while this one represents the \"det som en gang var\" esthetic of Burzum, referring not to that album, but to what that phrase literally means - a longing for that which once was, in this case pagan Norway before the white plague (i.e the invasion of xianity), with untouched forests and Old Norse runes. The wolf in the beginning might very well be howling for a return to such a past.\n\nSo basically I see that there are two different sides of Burzum that somehow got placed together in a music video which is quite good the way it is, and I enjoy watching it, but would be far better if it stuck to one train of thought.\n\nI wonder if anyone's ever done videos for other Burzum songs? I'd really like to see the following - Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, Jesus Tod, maybe Det Som En Gang Var, and most of all Gebrechlichkeit II (maybe I).\n",
        "\nThe song is as good as always, but there really was no point in this video. Seven and a half minute cannot be filled with just two ideas (not counting the silent wolf in the beginning). We got foggy pictures all the way, clearly shot without any kind of tripod. Unsteady tree footage and some water with wave patterns or runes being drawn on stone, wood, and waters and in the middle of the air \u2013 that\u2019s what we get. Sure, Varg brings us pictures all around from the nature, but we really only get three or four shooting locations that have been messed with later on. Everything gets changed colours, mainly in yellow, but also in green, blue and so on. The animations don\u2019t really fit the musical rhythms either.\n\nFrom every video technical standpoint this is some of the worst low-budget stuff ever released. The fans of this video claim it to be a hypnotic experience of nature. Right \u2013 minimalism in his music and minimalism in his videos. Not a bad thing in itself but combined with a cameraman not knowing how to hold his gear, repetition of the same landscape \u2013 just with a new colour filter \u2013 what? They say black metal is filled with stupid videos and that Dunkelheit is the exception. It might not be stupid as it has some real good ideas \u2013 some more wouldn\u2019t have made it worse though. And some variation in the shooting locations would\u2019ve been real good.\n",
        "\nI like a lot of the so called tr00 bands but I\u2019m not going to jump on the bandwagon and rave about this album. I really don\u2019t understand the great popularity. I fail to get sucked into Varg\u2019s world. I do like Burzums later releases though. Filosofem anyone? But yet I just find this S/T fairly dull except for a few points. \n\nThis is the most straightforward black metal put forth by Varg. Varg made the right move into transferring his style involving much more keyboard work as he manages to create a much greater atmosphere.\n\nThe same guitar riffs are played over and over again but instead of putting me into a trance as much of this style does it just bores the hell out of me especially in Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown and Ea, Lord of the Depths. I get hardly any sense of dark atmosphere that many people seem to find. Ea, Lord of the depths opens up with an almost happy riff that sounds like it would be in some oldskool videogame such as Golden Axe. In fact I think it may well have been. This riff is then dropped into a much more boring one which is a pity cause it started out better. \n\nThe guitars are played a little on the sloppy side at times and the vocals sound like almost any bloke off the street could have performed them, just random screams over and over again. It is really nothing special. It could drive almost anyone to insanity or even worse, suicide (or maybe insanity is worse, it\u2019s your call). I do like some suicidal metal such as Silencer (Swe) or Abyssic Hate\u2019s Suicidal Emotions. The difference is with those bands, is that they manage to create some great atmosphere so there is the possibility of getting sucked into their world, and with Burzum that is mostly not the case.\n\nThe vocals seem to greatly suck on My Journey Into The Stars, which otherwise is an incredible track as it is quicker in pace and much better riffing. The guitars here actually sound really grim and atmospheric, but as I said before the vocals ruin the track. The same goes for The Black Spells Of Destruction which is quite possibly the most covered song in black metal, including covers by the likes of Beatrik and Nargaroth. In fact I have a compilation devoted entirely to covers of this one song. My favourite track on this album would be The Crying Orc, simply because it is an instrumental and doesn\u2019t feature Varg\u2019s horrible screams.\n\nHow other people can decipher Varg\u2019s lyrics from his vocals is beyond me. If I listen really hard I can sometimes make a word out here and there but to do that I have to use all my attention and divert it from everything else but I don\u2019t listen to black metal for the lyrics in the first place so this does not bother me. \n\nI don\u2019t totally hate this album, it has some nice riffing in here but Varg doesn\u2019t quite manage to capture that atmosphere that he does with his later works. If the vocals were better then this album would be a fair bit better but still nothing spectacular, but as it stands this is fairly mediocre. I recommend listening to some of Burzum\u2019s later works such as Aske and Filosofem instead as he began to find his potential.\n",
        "\nThis is the most Black Metal sounding album in the Burzum catalogue.\n\nLike most Black Metal that existed at the time 'Burzum/Aske' is made up of simple patterns which eventually evolve to something larger and extremely coherant. Percussion is in the style of Hellhammer, often rising to the level of what a lot may call 'noise'.\n\nThe blend of guitars, drums and Varg's screaming vocals can often suffocate the ears with a tremendous level of what, at first appears, as un-clear, feral 'noise', the music, however, is dissectable, just like a lot of Black Metal.\n\nThe purpose of the album seems to be a fantasy world that is both 'good' and 'bad'. The world created, at first, seems grossly dark and morbid. Yet the fantasy world can be turned on it's head to form a world where one has to have wits and will to survive, instead of the modern world, where evolution is denied and there is a constant, sickening light. This plays into the duality of the name of Burzum.\n\nThe simple guitar patterns and repetition almost lull the listener into some form of light hypnosis, and the screeching vocals become almost clear, this allowing the listener to be drawn into the world, away from the light.Tempos and music change from slow and audible to fast and blurry, rushing past the different landscapes of the created fantasy land.\n\nThe work is very much a showcase for the potential of ambient metal where it uses mostly barely modified simple power-chords, a rebellion against the structured fit-in-a-box metal of before, including metal that was also later re-classified as Black Metal.\n\nVocals are actually remarkable once you get past the difficulty of listening to the screech (some people actually take time with these vocals and are still dead-set against them, personally I quite enjoy them). Rather than being 'a bit where the musician makes a noise with his mouth' the vocals accentuate the guitar parts excellently, as if they are driving the music at some points. This almost adds an entire new dimension to the vocals.\n\nAs with all Burzum releases, this album is not exempt from keyboard work either (Channeling the Power of Souls into a New God). The keyboard work is nothing like what was released on Hvis Lyset Tar Oss and Filosofem, it does, however, have the same dream-like melody which continues the 'hypnosis' already created by the previous songs.\n",
        "\nHvis Lyset Tar Oss having effectively provided a capstone to ambient black metal composition, Varg Vikernes evidently did what he\u2019s always done, and what few others seem capable of \u2013 he moved on.\n\nIf there were any lingering aspects of heavy metal or \u201cnormal rock\u201d in Burzum\u2019s music before, they\u2019ve been definitively exorcised by now. Listen to the first track on this album, \u201cDunkelheit\u201d, back to back with the Kraftwerk song \u201cRadioactivity\u201d and make your own guesses about where Vikernes\u2019 influences lie. And naturally the twenty-minute synthesizer track speaks for itself.\n\nPersonally, it\u2019s the first three tracks on this album \u2013 the ostensively \u201cblack metal\u201d songs \u2013 that provide the most interest to me. They\u2019re among the most direct and catchy songs in Burzum\u2019s catalog, while paradoxically being quite subtle. The ambient possibilities of guitar distortion are exploited to the fullest here, the buzzy tone somehow ending up far more soothing than harsh; multiple tracks are layered upon one another, creating an ambiguous, dream-like wall of sound. \n\n(These first three songs have turned out to be enormously influential: witness the \u201csuicidal black metal\u201d movement, which seems to largely consist of bands borrowing liberally from Filosofem\u2019s aesthetic then merrily watering it down with rock music, probably under the influence of Katatonia\u2019s Brave Murder Day. As many blatantly Burzum-influenced black metal bands as I\u2019ve heard, I\u2019ve yet to hear a single one that actually sounds like Burzum.)\n\nThe last half of the album is given to even purer ambience and minimalism. Tracks four and six (companion pieces) exclude drums to better concentrate on atmosphere; five is the monster minimalist instrumental keyboard track. As much as I admire the fact that Varg Vikernes was able to see past black metal being an end unto itself, I must admit there are other takes on this sort of thing that I prefer \u2013 some good examples being from the German electronic music of the 1970s that were surely an influence on Burzum. Nevertheless, the artistic approach and unique melodic touch that marks all of Burzum\u2019s music is evident here.\n\nIf it really needs to be said: all Burzum is essential.\n",
        "\nAh, Det Som En Gang Var, an album most fans of Norwegian Black Metal are not without. This album may have sold more copies from Varg's infamous church burnings and the killing of Euronymous than for the musical value. With that aside, I bought this album not for the music of a deranged killer, but for the music of one of Black Metal's patron saints, so to speak.\n\nThe cover of this album alone would make one wonder what kind of music was inside the digipack it is sold in these days. A nice illustration sets the mood for \"true\" black metal with a side of depression and agony that only Burzum seems to offer. The first intro track pulls you into the mind of Varg Vikernes as you prepare for the double bass guitar attack that most black metal has after it's intro. The next track, Key to the Gate is of course exactly what most would anticipate. For the first few minutes, it is a pretty typical black metal track with Varg's somewhat annoying vocals. A ways through it slows down a bit and is what I find to be one of the most defining parts of the album. This song made this album one of my favorites, as it shows Varg's more musical side.\n\nMoving on, En Ring Til Aa Herske follows a similar pattern to the track before it. Alot of heavy black metal with moments of slower depressing guitars. These are the most memorable portions of the album, but it doesn't go down- hill in the least bit from there. All of the Norwegian-titled tracks seem to be the best, especially Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn.\n\nThe 1% of criticism I have on this album is Varg's vocals. Many say that his despair-filled voice adds emotion and a unique feel. I would agree with this if I did not think that it was just an excuse. The people that say Varg's vocals are some of the best in black metal, are wrong. It sounds like he's getting his penis caught in a slamming door. Because of the outstanding musical output on this album, I am willing to overlook the vocals.\n",
        "\nPerhaps the epitome of the Norwegian Black Metal movement of the early to mid 1990's, these hymns are the creation of a visionary. Recorded and released at a time when new ground was being broken musically and ideologically, 'Aske' is not so much a 3 track mini-CD as it is a statement. The front cover alone is enough to give you an indication of the ideas Grishnackh was purporting at the time. \n\nSomewhat of a rarity here, this incarnation of Burzum is not solely Varg. Emperor's Samoth lent his bass-playing talents to 2 of the 3 tracks (namely tracks 1 and 3), though it's hard to notice, honesty. The production is rough and raw, but the guitars and drums, and vocals are clearly audible, and overall the production suits the music perfectly. \n\nThe 3 tracks on offer are all excellent. \"Stemmen Fra Taarnet\" is a grim, Bathory-esque headbanger of a song. Beginning with a simplistic first-wave-sounding BM riff and developing slowly into an epic yet subtle piece, the feeling prevalent is one of soaring Norwegian landscapes by the sea, of water, and of fjords. Atmospheric is an understatement. The song ends very abruptly, strangely enough, leaving the listener momentarily off balance. \n\nBefore given time to recover, \"Dominus Sathanas\" begins with an evil as fuck riff. Layered guitars provide harmonies and melodies that are equally menacing and sorrowful. Early on, Varg whispers something then lets out an acidic scream around 30 seconds into the track. Although short and somewhat repetitive, this effort serves as a good intermezzo between the 2 behemoths either side of it. \n\n\"A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\" is a fucking masterpiece of ashen, hateful, \"depressing\" (before that term became stale and meaningless) black metal, which is hard to describe musically, because the level it works best on is spiritually. This is another grand, epic firestarter, bringing to mind the image of a Norwegian standing in front of a blazing church in the black of night, gazing with pride upon what he has just created. Again, the pace is slow to moderate for most of the song, at times sounding like the kind of thing Nortt might do nowadays, though not as well.\n\nThe Count's burning screams embody perfectly the prevailing mood and spirit of this mCD. The sound of one man struggling against Christianity, single-handedly fighting to rid his proud, noble country of the pathetic Christian plague, and attempting to, with music and fire as his weapons, bring back \"what once was\". Close your eyes, and be taken to another place. A place where the strong prevail. Where the spirits of old are alive once more. \n\n-Damien.\n",
        "\nVarg Vikernes' project, Burzum, was formed after the departure of Old Funeral. The Youth's musical passion hadn't died, and the spirit lives on as the first demo was released, simply titled Demo I. Demo I has 3 songs that have been a major target by bootleggers, Lost Wisdom, Spell of Destruction, and Channeling the Power of Souls.\n\nThe demo was recorded what sounds similar to the production quality of Mayhem's famous Pure Fucking Armageddon demo. With it's noticable \"taking low end too far\" production that makes your ears scream in pain due to it's harshness the release is one that is so cryptic to hear what's going on in the background, which is usually a few chords here, and there. Like most demos by early black metal bands it was limited, very primitive music for the sake of being extreme, far before any idealogical concepts were concieved through the art of black metal.\n\nAlso it seems there are no vocals on this original demo, which makes the minutes seem like hours as each of the 3 songs drag on 4 to 5 minutes with 2 riffs consisting of a couple chords played in very raw, low end be-all-end-all muddy production. The overall music itself is pretty dark, and moody like much of Varg's work has been throughout the years.\n\nA powerful demo if you can stand listening to it once, and even so it merits that much. A must listen to for any serious burzum fan, just to experience this release one time is a fascinating treat. The dark, yet primitive aesthetics of this release give the music a lot of character despite it's poor production quality.\n",
        "\nAnd, although I know you were all expecting one of my excellent puns, this release has no place for one. It is, in lament terms, fucking perfection.\n\nAlthough Varg may claim he dislikes his first four albums, I believe that the previous reviews sum up exactly how good this album actaully is. Varg Vikernes is one of the most infamous pioneers of the entire black metal scene, and proves it with this excellent release. Burzum/Aske is the combination of the self-titled album along with the Aske EP. This being one of the first black metal albums I ever heard, I didn't know what to think. I did, however, know that is was truly something amazing. From the opening song, \"Feeble Screams From Forests Unknown\", is the pace of this entire album. Varg's vocals are indeed among the best in black metal. These higher pitched screams sound almost like screams of pain, of agony. The crashing, exploding blastbeats, the distortion of the guitars, the trudging bass, and these screams are the essence of Burzum. Along with a previous review (dividingforce) I agree that \"Ea, Lord of the Depths\" is among the first I heard with what we know today as traditional black metal picking. And, if that isn't enough, we also have here some of the ambient Burzum. The atmospheric touch of \"Channelling the Power of Souls into a New God\" comes along, and I feel that it further adds to the solitude you feel when listening to Burzum. Although the most raw of albums, this does not have shit-poor production, and yet Varg adds this excellent ambient track. Who could have expected that we would have more of this atmospheric, slow sound in the future?\n\nAs a last note, I must state the effect of the simple instrumental \"The Crying Orc\" This song is nothing more than a heavily distorted guitar, yet it really does bring a sad feeling to your heart. The entire album, for that matter, sets an unequaled melancholic atmosphere that embodies all that is black metal. This album is history.\n",
        "\nI consider every Burzum album nothing short of a masterpiece. I would listen to each one, and I would like the next one better than the one I listened to previously, but this album, it just takes the term masterpiece and goes beyond it. Everything is great about it, the vocals, guitar, drum and bass. Best of all this album establishes a dark atmosphere that can plunge you into the black metal world and never let you go.\n\nThe first song you get on this CD is 'Det Som En Gang Var' and it is a black metal song of epic proportions, it starts out with somewhat of a long intro and then eventually leads into droning black metal riffs, sometimes that would be a bad thing, but Varg finds a way to make it work and just creates darkness with every riff he hits, the bass is well heard enough and the drumming is standard, but that is all you need for this song to be perfect, it would never have to go above and beyond. Also worth mentioning is a neat drum effect that is used a couple of times in the song. Vargs vocals sound like they usually do, very shreaky and very awesome, this is Varg at his bes.\n\nThe next song 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' is more of a standard black metal tune, but when is coming from this man, nothing is standard. The riffs are of course awesome to listen to, more great vocals, bass and drumming. It doesn't stand out or anything, but it goes along with the rest of the album perfectly.\n\nThe same can be said for the next song pretty much 'Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen', it's more of the standard stuff, but it just works with the album so easily, and I really like the translated english title of the song too.\n\n'Tomhet' The last song on the album, is nothing like the rest of the CD, but that is what makes it great. It serves as the perfect closer to a perfect album. It's more of the synth/keyboard stuff that Varg is known for with his later albums. It's a very simple track, but it also keeps the dark atmosphere going and will just engulf you with the emotion and the darkness that is present in the track.\n\nSo, the main thing I have to say with this review is that you need to hear this album, if you find it in a store one day, and are interested in Burzum or Black Metal, you have to give this one a shot, it's just an amazing piece of work that should never be forgotten in the Metal world. Go get it now!!\n",
        "\nVarg finished off Burzum nicely with this last release. He takes you on a wave of surrealism, from start to finish, never letting you go. For just using a keyboard, Varg gets a nice effect and manages to have many different tracks that don't sound the same.\n\nAll of the tracks are very good on this album, the stand out for me though, would be 'Der Tod Wuotans'. This track has such a beautiful sound to it, it's very simple, but just using a keyboard, it seems to convey so much emotion, it's sad sounding, but calming and is simply great music to have in the backround or to be actually listening to. What makes the track even more amazing is that it comes from the man who used to make some of the most extreme and best black metal there was, so it is a very interesting, and musically enjoyable change of pace.\n\nLike I said before, the rest of the tracks are all very good, they can all have different tempos and never drag on too long, if anything, they are not long enough. \n\nThe Production on the album is crystal clear, you can hear everything about the keyboard perfectly, If not told it was recorded in a prison, you may never know.\n\nIn Conclusion, this is an absolutely amazing album which both Burzum fans and non Burzum fans could enjoy, it's not too soft or too hard, it just finds the right balance to make it one hell of a finish for Burzum\n",
        "\nIt was night and I was restless. So I thought of calming down with a beer and some music. So I popped in \"Filosofem\", plugged in my headphones, turned off the lights and sat back, sipping on my beer. This album is one of my favorite black metal albums; it combines aggression with melancholy and loneliness. Pretty much all the other Burzum recordings (except the last two synthesizer albums and the demos) have the same production since they were all recorded in Grieghallen and were engineered and produced by Pytten. In the case of \"Filosofem\" the things are slightly different. The album is recorded in Breidablik Tonstudio. Who the producer is on this album, is unknown. It almost seems like Vikernes did all the job recording and mixing the album, but since Vikernes was in jail by that time, so the mixer and producer of the album is still a mystery.\n\nSince the producer is different from the other albums so are the songs. The first thing you'll notice is the enormous distortion on guitars (and bass) and the vocals. You will not hear Vikernes angstful shrieks that you heard on the other albums, but instead you can hear tired, growled vocals with a lot of distortion on them. That is of course no drawback, since it gives the listener a different experience and it implies another kind of angst and melancholy. The drums here are in the good old style; sometimes Vikernes kicks with a double bass drum (or double pedal) and sometimes he only uses a bass drum (as the case of the song \u201cBurzum\u201d a. k. a. \u201cDunkelheit\u201d). The slow songs create an incredible atmosphere that is very hard to be outdone. The composition is as always very good, with catchy riffs and melodies. The lyrics are full of melancholy, angst, misanthropy, loneliness, but also intelligence. I\u2019ve always found Vikernes lyrics intelligent, however simple they might have seen at the glimpse of the eye. Then we have the all keyboards song \u201cTour Around The Transcendental Pillars of Singularity\" that is about 23 minutes long and has pretty much the same melody for the entire song, which might seem pretty frustrating, but actually is kind of relaxing. It was like Vikernes wanted the listener to relax and take a break from all the feelings that the listener was overwhelmed with in the previous songs. The album ends with the song \u201cDecrepitude II\u201d which is pretty much as the song \u201cDecrepitude\u201d except there are no vocals and you can hear sounds that sound like miner workers hitting the rocks with their tools in the search for whatever they dig for. And I think that made me think of dwarfs from Tolkien\u2019s world that worked in the mountains digging for gold and I think that\u2019s what Vikernes wanted to bring up with that.\n\nAnother thing I enjoyed was the incredible artwork of the album. As usual it was Theodor Kittelsen who provided the paintings, but Vikernes wrote a little text in order to analyze the different paintings and the paintings seem in relevance to the context and what Burzum evolved to: a link between Vikernes and his ancestors and the folk mythologies. Since this is one of those albums you don\u2019t want to miss, I think it\u2019s worthless to say go buy it now. This is not music, this is art.\n",
        "\nI know that my rating is a bit high for a demo that only has guitars and drums, but this recording is something really special that caught my attention from the first time. The quality you can imagine is not the best you can find. But in those days you did not have a lot of money to pay for studio time. Grishnack recorded this in (what it seems to be, I don't really know) some rehearsal place with a regular radio-cassette system so I've heard. Since Grishnack only could have handled one instrument I've wondered who the drummer is. Could he be Olivier Lancelot (Ulver, among others) who is sometimes credited as beeing a part of Burzum? Nevertheless I've just thought of that just for the sake of it.\n\nLost Wisdom - One of the best Burzum tracks, re-recorded later for the \"Det Som Engang Var\" album shows what Burzum is really about. Minimalistic composition, but still energic in mid-tempo. The drums are also primitive and not that extranvagant as some people demand nowadays.\n\nSpell of Destruction - A track that stinks of intelligence. I haven'r really said this about any track before, but this composition is really one of the smartest and intelligent ones. Grishnack used as with the previous track minor scales. The drums are more energic on this track than the previous, hiting the tomes also, not just the hi-hat, bas, snare and crash as the previous one. The rythm shifts between slow and fast on different parts of the song.\n\nChanneling... - Performed on keyboards and I think guitar or bass (or both). The keyboard pretty much plays everything over and over again, a melody that is filled with melancholy and loneliness. The guitar or a distorted bass is filling in with great tunes that concorde excellent with the keyboard. No drums on this track, which is fine, since drums would have been a terrible misstake on this song.\n\nOutro - The ending of the demo, this outro is unlisted. Keyboards and what seems a guitar are performing something indistinguishable. The quality is too poor to make a proper description of this. But the track however made me fantasize about exploring a dark cave with only a torch in my hands.\n\nIn the end I would like to say that it doesn't really matter how bad the quality is of a recording if it has feeling and that is exactly what Burzum's first demo has. This is one classic recording that will never die.\n",
        "\nYou know those albums by artists you love which are evidencing of the fact that the artist is slipping, and you\u2019re not sure if they\u2019ll be able to balance themselves out again? This is exactly what this album is like for Burzum. This makes me think around the lines of \u2018Ouch...err...I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to recover from this one.\u2019 I wish I could say otherwise, because I love Burzum and the idea of Varg having made a mediocre album doesn\u2019t fascinate me. Never the less, it\u2019s true - this full-fledged keyboards album is rather mediocre.\n\nI don\u2019t mind minimalism at all, because I happen to love the \u201cHlidskjalf\u201d album; but if you\u2019re going to go down the path of a minimalist, then you need variety! Most of the songs are VERY repetitive and don\u2019t transform or have any interesting direction; it just keeps a basic rhythm pattern and repeats it over and over again. There are some interesting lead key parts thrown in, but UGH, the rhythm rarely changes! Songs like \u201cBalferd Baldrs\u201d keep the same rhythm all the way through, occasionally playing that same rhythm with a different sound...so it\u2019s fairly boring for a six-minute song. The up side to this album is that it\u2019s rather alarming and sometimes even disturbing.\n\nYeah, the over consistencies may annoy you at times, but the mood is so gloomy and sad that it\u2019s almost creepy. I don\u2019t know anything of the story of Baldrs, but since Varg portrays it as a very melancholic and pessimistic tale, I can imagine the general gist of it. The entire album is in midi form, so it\u2019s rather sloven, tempestuous, and rugged in sound; it\u2019s not clear and tidy like the follow-up of this album. There aren\u2019t that many complexities in the songs, but some are rather intriguing (\u201cMoti Ragnarokum\u201d and \u201cIlla Tidandi\u201d are my personal favorites) with their lonely sound, as if it\u2019s alone in a dark forest and looking for shelter. Good, but yet again, the perpetuity is too much.\n\nI feel that most of the song lengths could easily be cut in half, or a quarter at least and still manage to deliver a powerful performance; because when the listener becomes irritated due to over extensive song length, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve messed up. In all honesty, I would have enjoyed this very much if Varg had either shortened the songs or would have added more variety of elements in his songs; preferably the latter. I get the feeling that Varg tried with this album, but somewhere along the lines he got lost, forgot he\u2019d gotten lost, and decided to declare the album done. This album is highly repetitive, but still okay for an occasional listen...although, don\u2019t get your hopes up too high for something really cool. In my opinion, this isn\u2019t worthy of being called Burzum...but it\u2019s not a complete stain to the name by any means.\n\nThe good: creepy atmosphere, decent musicianship.\nThe bad: too repetitive and drawn out.\n",
        "\nWhenever you're feeling angry or depressed, do you ever wish you could either burn the world to the ground, or just create your own world for yourself? I know that is how I feel sometimes, and by the sound of this album, Varg possesses the same desire on occasion. After all, the world isn\u2019t exactly all fun and loving, but at the same time it isn\u2019t always as cruel or as cold as some make it out to be. In times such as this, it\u2019s not too hard to understand what draws people into viewing the world from a misanthropic perspective. Yet again, Varg captures his emotions and transmutes them into some vivid and intense music.\n\nI would definitely say it takes a different kind of listener to appreciate this kind of music, instead of the average gr1m and n3kr0 black metal fan. The only parallel this album holds to any other works of Varg\u2019s is probably Hlidskjalf (in the sense that even though it\u2018s minimalism is obvious, it still captivates); even then that is calling it close. The guitars are heavily distorted, loud and crispy in sound, which gives the over all sound kind of a passive chaotic feel to it. This isn\u2019t the kind of angry that smashes you in the face, but more or less dwells right in front of you; bubbling and waiting to explode against anyone who crosses it\u2018s path. The steady and tranquil drums only help to reinforce and escalate the feeling of bitter and unbridled dejected misanthropy.\n\nVarg approaches with some chilly keyboard melodies, which send shivers to every corner of the body. It\u2019s so cold and passively angry that it\u2019s almost creepy. This is the soundtrack for the concept of the evil demon that dwells in us all - the one that wants to come out, but our mind blocks it out. Much like Hlidskjalf, this is pretty abstract. The vocals are still raspy and shrieking, but on this album they are distorted and electronic.\n\nThere is a twenty-five minute instrumental on this album, and as much as I like the gloomy, forbidding, and cold sound it gives off, it is way too long in length. Varg could have easily conveyed the emotion of this song in less than twenty-five minutes; this just feels like a giant filler. Yes, the music is great, but almost half an hour is excessive for a minimalist and repetitive instrumental. Ten or fifteen minutes would have been enough time to get the point across without completely lulling the listener to sleep. Oh yeah, where the Hell is the bass on this album?\n\nEither it\u2019s just very hard to hear, or Varg removed it all together. At this point in time, this isn\u2019t like all of Varg\u2019s other work; it\u2019s much more abstract and contrived from deep thought and emotion, rather than just creating an album that would appeal to people. Also, it was around this time that Varg began to become disgusted with most metal in general, so it\u2019s no real surprise that he began to change his own music. Not a bad album, it\u2019s not my favorite, but still an excellent piece of work on behalf of the Count. If you are a person who likes their music to step into the boundaries of being theoretical, then you\u2019ll probably enjoy this.\n",
        "\nAs we all know by now this is Varg's very last album. Having come off albums like Det Som Et Gang Var and Filosofem obviously people saw a huge difference in the music when Daudi Balders rolled along, but that was only the beginning. The second ambiant piece known as \"Hildskjalf\" was later released and proved to leave you breathless. I have listened to this album many times. I advise you to listen to and understand it. It's not an album to blast in your car down the higway. One of my favorite things is to sit in my room and play it in pure darkness, after midnight. Hell i don't ever recall playing this album before night.\n\nEnough chit chat let's see why this album is brilliance. Let's begin with the stunning melodies. Very epic and thrilling with each time you play this album(for me it's at least 3 times a week.) with music that reaches out to you and pulls you into deep within it's grasp and suffocates you from every breath as you're caught in the true power and emotion of it all.\n\nTuistos Herz despite what everyone says about it is a very good beginning song. I don't see why it's not. The pace isn't like the later songs when you got into it. I doesn't drive full anger and force like Ansuzgaedaraiwo does, but i'll get into that song later. The synthesizers on this song are very stunning. Sure i know people have already said it's repetitive like every song on this album is at one point or another. Usually the intro is throughout the song as extra stuff comes in play every bit. This will leave everything coming at full force and each song will take your breath away like that.\n\nDer Tod Wuotans is more intense. With the majestic intro that sounds like a middle ages or pagan type theme but more powerful then the other pagan piece Die Liebe Nerpus. By the middle of the song the intro is engulfed by a very melodic type sound that relaxes the song and would allow you to meditate or something as each sound flows like water through your vains. After the two or three minutes that occurs you will see that feeling die down and merge with the majestic intro to make the songs finally one of my personal favorites of the album\n\nAnsuzgadaraiwo is probably the angriest piece on this album known as \"Hildskjalf\". It starts out semi calm. Continuing from Tuistos Herz...but pulse into a very angry synthesizer that as well sounds very haunting, especially in the dark. It will make you stand on end\n\nDie Liebe Nerpus' goes back to the other theme with the whole pagan experience there. As we all know Varg is really into the whole pagan thing so this melody was probably inspired by Pagan folk music. I don't know this 100% for the folk part because i have never heard the pagan folk music. But i can tell it has a folkish theme to it and know for a fact it's a pagan type thing.\n\nFrijos Einsames Trauern is a more calm and melodic song of the album. With a very high piched piano type this for a while. Until it gets into a mallets and more bass sounding piano. As a pianist myself i really enjoy this song and the tranquil energy that flows from each key.\n\nEinfuhlungsvermogen is another one of those songs with a lot of synth thrown into them at the beginning. Maybe like a finally piece for the synth trilogy. I'm not totally sure but like every other masterpiece crammed onto this this piece is no different and is epic and memorable with every part. A more symphonic feel to it near the middle of the song. Which goes on for quite a while until the end where the synth calms down and becomes more peaceful.\n\nFrijos Goldene Tranen is a great. Sounds like a meditative tape i've heard, though it's extremely stunning. I don't know how Varg can capture such naturous sounds with this final piece and present them in such a fucking powerful way. With another peaceful ending to finalize each epical song.\n\nDer Weinende Hadnur is too short for my liking. Though it's very melodic to end the album without some raging angry song. It'll end you with the album in pure awe for quite a while and make you wish you could play it again.\n\nOverall this album is one of the most brilliant albums in history of metal....though it's an ambiant album Burzum is still notorious for black metal. With each powerful and stunning theme covering the album you can tell it's very Atmospheric and emotional. When listening to it in the dark close you eyes and it'll give you some amazing visuals while each pulse inside of you becomes one with the musical journey Varg has put you upon. A fucking masterpiece in the music world that i wish everyone had the power to understand. I have listened to it many times yet i still lack many keys to the doors that make this album more brilliant then i believe it really is. Hail Varg for the creation of this masterpiece.\n",
        "\nWell, this certainly isn\u2019t a bad way for Varg to end his twelve-year relationship with his Burzum project. From the start of his career, he made love to the music in a more aggressive manner with raw and dominating black metal. Comparing the start of his career to the time set of this album, Varg has slowed down and decided to nurture the music in a less impressionable manner and in more of an abstruse sense, rather than go to war with it in an enterprising and militant battery. For starters, the production is completely serene unlike all of his other releases. Although there are only keyboards at work, it\u2019s not as scruffy and sloven sounding as Daudi Baldrs.\n\nAlthough the melodies are somewhat repetitive and show minimalism, they are very captivating and sometimes soporific. However, just because some tracks may induce the will to play this before sleep, don\u2019t think that this album is subdued into the realm of firmness and stability. Some tracks are very dark in atmosphere with some creepy effects and sounds (Tuistos Herz and Ansuzgardaraiwo are good examples of the dismal and swarthy sound I\u2019m referring to). It\u2019s quite obvious that this wasn\u2019t an album that was made from skill, per say...but rather it was made from pure, raw, and uncontaminated emotion which had probably been dwelling in Varg for some time. It\u2019s impossible to lend your ears a brief listen to this album to be able to fully appreciate it; you have to sit and really listen to catch the twists, turns, and complexities.\n\nThis is the kind of ambient material suitable for a dark and rainy day, for when you can light a candle in the dark and brood until you lose yourself in the passion and intensity. If you\u2019re looking for some super, awe-filled piano shredding ambience, you shouldn\u2019t expect it from this. This is more or less for the cognitive musician who is able to think abstractly and not shit himself over how grim or necro something is. If you can appreciate ambience and true passion, then this should be right up your alley.\n",
        "\nHere we have another master album from one of the kings of black metal: Varg Vikernes. From start to finish, this album is a roller coaster of emotions and raw music. If you look past all of the commotion surrounding Varg, his ideals, and his actions you can feel loads of sensitive emotion in his music. The guitars are heavy as usual, and have this crunchy sound to them. Varg\u2019s raspy screams really add to the atmosphere of the music.\n\nAt times you can feel the pain of this man through his blood curdling screams. The bass is there and can be heard quite clearly. The drums aren\u2019t anything mind blowing, but still okay. Varg is more known for his guitar work anyways. The guitar work is a bit primitive at times, but it\u2018s mobilized effectively and provides enjoyment to the listener.\n\nThis album consists of four instrumentals and four songs with Varg singing (two of which are in English). The opening instrumental really gives off the feeling of power. It\u2019s dark and simple, yet enjoyable. It gives good lead way into the next track, \u201cKey to the Gate\u201d. Track two starts off kind of fast and heavy, moving into a more mid paced melodic song. \n\nYou get to hear a lot of Varg\u2019s \u201cpain screams\u201d, as I like to call them. The melody in this song is enough to make you feel as if Varg\u2019s inner child is shining on those notes (at least that\u2018s what it reminds me of). The next song, \u201cEn Ring Til Aa Herske,\u201d is a more slow and ambient piece all around. Varg sings, but it\u2019s ambient in it\u2019s own way. This obviously wasn\u2019t a song that was meant to be \u201cdangerous\u201d or anything.\n\nNext we have Lost Wisdom, which is probably my favorite Burzum song. This track is no joke. It\u2019s filled with heaviness, deadly screams, and killer melody. The lyrics sound kind of sad, but it\u2019s still a heavy song. Definitely the best song on the album, I think. \n\nThe next track is another ambient piece. It\u2019s all synthesized, and seemingly minimal, but if you listen you can catch some complexities. A good addition to this album indeed, as it sets the mood very well. The next track we have an instrumental song. It starts off nicely, but as the song begins to progress it gets kind of bland. \n\nIt\u2019s a pleasure to listen to, but not nearly as strong as the other songs on the album. The next song is a very cool one, and to me this is one of the high points on the album. The guitar melodies are simple, yet brutal and crushing. The song builds up with heaviness and eventually halts to slower pace riffing. Before the song starts to end, it picks up a bit.\n\nAmazing song, and probably my second favorite on the album. The last track is another synthesized instrumental, but it burns with melody and dark atmosphere. Accompanied by noises and some effects, the atmosphere is kept throughout the song. Not a bad final track to end off with. All and all, this is an amazing and vastly overlooked by black metal fans.\n\nIf you are a fan of ambient, heavy, and crushing black metal then this album is definitely for you. I\u2019d even go as far to say that it\u2019s essential for black metal fans. I think most BM fans would enjoy it very much. Beautiful album and highly recommended.\n",
        "\nThe (supposedly) final Burzum album and the 2nd album by the \"new\" Burzum (which, as you already know by now, consists of Varg Vikernes sitting in prison with a synthesizer). I won't waste your time talking about the circumstances around the album or the philosophy of the man behind the music, but I will say that Hlidskjalf is a surprisingly emotional and moving album. A vast improvement over Daudi Baldrs, which often sounded flat and almost MIDI-like. Then again, it probably was MIDI. Hlidskjalf has a very spacey, almost disconnected sound to it. It's hard to explain, but the music is both ambient and melodic.\n\nYou may find it hard to believe that music created by one man in a prison cell could truly be moving, but just disregard all of the drama and images conjured up in your head of a bearded Varg twiddling away on his keyboard and listen to the music. Don't just hear the music, but truly listen! This is the perfect music to drift to sleep listening to, or to enhance moments of intoxication (you know what I mean). \n\nSeemingly minimalistic (listen closely and you'll catch the complexities) and definitely hypnotic, Hlidskjalf is the ideal companion for an evening of solitude. Just keep the lights on or hide under your covers, as this stuff can actually be downright scary at times. Those who have heard the album understand what I mean.\n\nEvery song on the album is a highlight, and in fact, I wouldn't suggest listening to individual songs as much as finding a place to relax and listening to the album straight-through start to finish, uninterrupted. If you absolutely need to sample individual songs from the album, I'd recommend listening to the 1st and 3rd tracks successively (which I won't bother trying to name here, since my Norwegian isn't exactly fluent).\n\nThe last track, which is a re-make of the song \"The Crying Orc\" from the first Burzum full-length, actually moved me to tears first time I listened to it. The original song was an interesting listen, but not really anything special. The re-make on Hlidskjalf is absolutely spell-binding in its raw emotion (as raw as a song recorded completely digitally can be). I think it was also the realization that this would be the last new Burzum I'd ever hear that helped move me to tears though. Oh Varg, how we'll miss thee! \n\nMy only complaint (and the only reason I didn't rate this album something closer to 100) is the absence of Varg's signature vocal work. I realize it'd be difficult to record such nut-crunching screams from within a cell, but damned if that doesn't stop me from lamenting over the lack of tortured screams. \n\nMy personal biases aside, listen to the album, give it a chance and get rid of your misconceptions. Stop worrying about whether or not Burzum is \"tr00\" anymore or whether or not Varg is the head of some secret National-Socialist front and relax.\n",
        "\nBurzum's third full length, Hvis Lyset Tar Oss, is one of the few albums I would describe as a \"musical journey\" or any other hokey bullshit like that. There's four songs, and they are all fairly long, coming to a total of around 45 minutes. \n\nThe production is typical Burzum, or I guess I should say was typical Burzum, as this is the last album to feature this style. It's often described as \"dissonant\", which is a pretty accurate description, and somewhat onomatopoeic as well. The guitars have a good buzz to them, the drums are not overpowering like they are in so many metal albums, and the vocals are still the trademark Varg screeches. It's a very good production, without being good as defined by mainstream standards...but I could rail on all day about modern attitudes towards production values, so I'll stop there.\n\nThe first song, Det Som Engang Var, is a whopper. Varg not only made the best song of his career, but made what is quite possibly the best black metal song of all time. Words can't describe how good this song is. Even if the rest of the album was filled with crap, this one song would make it worth buying. If it were a single with only this song on it, I would give it a 100, or damn near close to it. It's that good, folks.\n\nThe next two songs are somewhat similar in their sound. They are both midtempo, moderately long, extremely repetitive pieces. That being said, I prefer Hvis Lyset Tar Oss...it's one of those songs that you can just put on and kind of sink into for its duration. The warm production helps a lot in that case. Inn I Slottet Fra Droemmen is more dynamic, which some will prefer. I prefer the hypnotic songs myself.\n\nAnyways, the last song, Tomhet, is a keyboard instrumental, and a pretty damn good one. It is essentially made up of two parts: the first a droning piece of the same essence as the title track; and the second a more peaceful style that sounds extremely familiar to me. I don't know if I've heard it before, or if I'm just insane, but at any rate it is very good, and a perfect ending to the album.\n\nIn my opinion, this is Varg's most cohesive work, and also his best. If you are looking for an intro to Burzum, I don't know if this would be it, as it is somewhat unorthodox. Det Som Engang Var the album would be a better starting point. However, one should not finish their exploration of Burzum's discography without listening to this. It's the best of Burzum.\n",
        "\nI could start this review talking about Varg Vikerness\u2019s (the one man behind this band) deeds but that topic has been covered so often already. I\u2019ll just say that in the case of Burzum, one would do well to separate the man from the music. On to the review.\n\n(Note: I wrote this review at the time Burzum/Aske was entered as one release in the archives, and I own only that one. The difference between Burzum and Aske is hard to notice. Aske has a slightly more muddled and darker sound, and if I would view it as a seperate release, I think it would come out on top, though by a very small margin.)\n\nThis reissue consists of Burzum\u2019s self-titled debut and his only EP, Aske, which was released after his second full-length. The songs on his first three releases were all written in the same period of time, so there are songs on Aske and his second full-length that predate the songs on this one. The original version of \u2018A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u2019 is cut from the tracklist, but that\u2019s no big deal because we have the remake on Aske.\n\nBurzum was one of the first bands to play an atmospheric variant of black metal, and his later releases would be even more focused on atmosphere. Burzum/Aske is Varg\u2019s most \u201cass-kicking\u201d release, and Black Metallers who can\u2019t enjoy atmospheric music will probably like this one the most.\n\nLike most BM, the guitar sound on this album is very ugly. Burzum doesn\u2019t yet use as many layers as on later albums (his trademark \u2018guitar-drone\u2019), and riffs are very recognizable. Compared to most BM albums there is a lot of variation in the guitar sound too. There are two solos on the album, both really adding to the songs.\n\nThe vocals are screeched and sound incredibly inhuman and otherwordly. Most of the times you can\u2019t make out the words, but the emotions are very strong. The lyrics are dark, sad and dreamy and handle a variety of subjects. They are definately worth reading and add to the songs.\n\nThe drums aren\u2019t the tightest in the world but are very enjoyable and driving (Track 2). Fans of clean production and clear sounds will probably hate this release, but ugly sounding instruments are a necessity in dark atmospheric music. Varg even adds some sloppiness on purpose: the slips in the solo and vocals of the \u2018Bathory influenced\u2019 War add to the fun. The production is clear enough to hear everything. Burzum is quite subtle though, and only multiple listens will reveal everything the music has to offer. The speed differs a lot both between and within the songs. Slow-downs in the songs are well-applied and don\u2019t interrupt the flow and feeling.\n\nBurzum/Aske doesn\u2019t contain just metal tracks: a gloomy keyboard song (the only use of keyboard on the album), a creepy noise track and two guitar-only tracks add more variation. This variation (a trademark of Burzum) is probably the strongest point of this particular release. Another trademark is the unity between the title, lyrics and music of the songs. For instance \u2018A Lost Forgotten Sad Spirit\u2019 is a wandering, doomy composition with some frantic and desperate sounding moments, justifying the title.\n\nAs an aside, I think the cover art is inspired by that song. I really like it but most people don\u2019t. The well-known cover art for the Aske EP, a burnt church, is used for the CD art.\n\nThe difference between Burzum and Aske is hard to notice. Aske has a slightly more muddled and darker sound, and if I would view it as a seperate release, I think it would come out on top, though by a very small margin.\n\nConclusion:\nThe high amount of variation, original and subtle songwriting and the unbeatable dark feeling of this CD make it an all-time classic. For a BM album it also has the very reasonable length of about an hour. This is the best album to start getting into Burzum, and one of the very best albums Black Metal has to offer.\n",
        "\nCertain kinds of extreme art cannot become effective, cannot reach the distilled, pure archetype, unless the artist communicates something which transcends humanity in such a way as the artist is excluded from the human state through his art, thereby escaping its trappings and limitations. With black metal, a genre as imbued with misanthropy as it is, the case is hardly different; here, reaching the distilled essence means an experience which, for the listener, is perceived as coming from a place frighteningly alien, thoroughly inhuman, a place which cannot be penetrated or grasped by the human soul in its mundane day-to-day existence.\n\nBurzum has always succeeded in this. To be fair, though, Varg is probably aided by the fact that his image, personality and deeds aren't exactly perceived as those of a 'normal' person. Intentionally or not, through his actions he has come to be perceived (among his supporters as well as his haters) as some sort of a modern-day mythical figure; the first thing learned by anyone with a remote interest in Norwegian black metal these days is the church burnings / Euronymous vs. Varg story, which in a sense might read like a mythological saga which should not have taken place in these modern, all-too-human times. But whether it's \"mythical figure\" or \"raving lunatic\", and whether or not this unconsciously affects the listener and gives Burzum an 'unfair push' in its path towards the goal described above - the point is that it gets there. And 'Det Som Engang Var' (''What Once Was'') is invincible proof.\n\nThis album sees Vikernes taking the ideas which had surfaced on the selftitled debut (Although DSEV is the third Burzum album by release date, it is actually the second one recorded; it was released only after the 'Aske' EP, but was recorded prior to it) and focusing them in a more particular direction. After a brooding ambient intro track, laden with low, reverberating, hollow subterranean music, 'Key To The Gate' starts off with a fast, chaotic seizure of mad lycanthropy, and elaborate dynamics evocative of old Bathory, only to morph into a slow melancholic dirge with wailing, melodic lead guitar. It contains such a sense of completeness as it is rare to find in a single song; has to be heard to be believed - surely this is one of the best songs Varg has ever written. The third track, 'En Ring til aa Herske', with its plodding pace and eerie clean background vocals, is like a slow, desperate march through the bleak mountain ranges of Mordor, chained and prodded along by the black Orcs - not an incongruous metaphor, perhaps, when you consider its title. 'Lost Wisdom', the next song, is a mid-paced, minimalistic black metal composition of the kind Varg is known for; the riffs are well constructed and surprisingly catchy, and the mood is overwhelming. The lyrics, exploring planes of existence different than our own, can actually be seen as symbolizing the entire experience of this album.\n\nOn the second half of the album, things get even more otherworldly. A repetitive, melodic, slow, five-minute synth instrumental, 'Han Som Reiste', opens it; using nothing but two synth patches, the subtle ebb and flow of the melody itself is emphasized, which is droning but almost beautiful, associating itself immediately with some natural scene or other of Norwegian landscapes. Following it is another instrumental - 'Naar Himmelen Klarner' - written as far back as '89, for the Uruk Hai project. Mostly a single distorted guitar, though later other instruments join, the melody lines on this track are incredible; it's not hard to see where bands like Judas Iscariot and Nargaroth got some of their ideas for droning guitar instrumentals.\n\n'Snu Mikrokosmos Tegn' is a severely underrated track. Perhaps heralding what was to come on 'Hvis Lyset Tar Oss' - drawn-out in length, utilizing repetitive and simplistic (yet layered) guitar, it starts out as very fast, chromatic black metal, after a few minutes turning into a slow, sparse, melodic composition, with an organic, undulating melody and not much of anything except the guitar, which uses that melancholic, bleeding, open-arpeggio riffing style pretty much patented by Burzum. The lyrics reflect the ecological annihilation of nature and its effect on human spirit; very well-written poetry. This is followed by the closing track - yet another instrumental, much in the vein of the intro but this time more complex; a background of various noises and effects, accompanied by dark, wistful bursts of synth melody. The atmosphere is kept throughout.\n\nThis album has an incredible esoteric feel to it, perhaps more so than other Burzum material. There doesn't exist a more potent testimonial for the relevance of ''what once was''. ESSENTIAL.\n",
        "\nThis debut LP of early Scandinavian blackmetal is without a doubt a definitive release. Playing is somewhat raw and simplistic, as Varg (a.k.a. Count Grishnackh) has never been an aspiring technical wonder; on this album, as on most of the others, he handles all instrumentation as well as composition. Song structures, however, are quite complex, as the trademark structure of a Burzum song unfolds in its unique way. This album was quite innovative at the time for black metal, in its constant alteration between fast double-bass blastbeat sections and slower, more drawn-out passages; the overall impression is that of a primitive, evil work, as the tremolo-picked, blastbeat-accompanied passages, offset by the more accentuated, punctual power-chord riffing of the slower-paced ones create the framework for the communication of the message contained within this work: a feeling of omnipresent sadness bubbles to the surface, as the angst and nihilism projected by the artist through his utilization of the characteristic structure of his unique brand of music allow the listener to see into what filters through - emotive, immensely atmospheric music, effectively communicating at all levels the artist's message: a tapping of the listener's imagination, a subtle manipulation of thought, urging the listener to follow along the lines of the author's dream; eschewing reality by creating its own, in the musical and artistic wholeness of this work. Traces of this can be found in the blatant plugs to the works of Tolkien, such as the album/project name (meaning \"darkness\" in the Black Speech of Mordor) and in \"The Crying Orc\", and, naturally, in the lyrics. \n\nSimple-by-comparison riffing gives way at most situations to a multi-layered sound, with single notes played over the riff accentuating either the melodic or atonal structure, which is inherently counterpoint music despite the relative simplicity of composition, with sometimes weirder tones blending into the mix in a far subtler manipulation of harmonious structure. Songs are composed in the way of a theme repeating itself in different variations, changing in nature and progressing to unfold the composition in its entirety. Simple drumming, minimalistic in the extreme, at times monotonic and droning, alternates with fast double-bass machinegun-drumming rattling crazily forward; then, a relative calmness permeates, as menacing acidic distortion oozes far above and all drumming stops except for the omnipresent double-bass rattle pounding underneath, as if gathering energy, momentum and tension, before springing forward again. \n\nThe approach to singing is quite extreme and unique, the vocals being the long, high-pitched hoarse screeches of a wounded demon, stretching the lyrics and making them hardly intelligible. The album is divided into two sides, each ending with an atmospheric dark ambient synth instrumental; the mood running like a thread through this entire composition remains that of wistful sadness and despair, yet of salvation in imagination, offering the sought-after alternative. Some of the more obvious influences by proto-blackmetal ancestors shine through on some tracks (Bathory on \"War\" or Mercyful Fate on \"My Journey to the Stars\"), but still this album offers enough uniqueness, being surprisingly consistent and coherent for a debut release. In a first glance this album might seem to be nothing but juvenile crap; people whose interest in blackmetal stems solely from the lilting musical beauty and aesthetic appeal of artists like Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir will be handicapped when trying to stomach this release. People whose interest in music is that of artistic appreciation will praise this work for what it is - a winsome, remarkable piece of art.\n"
