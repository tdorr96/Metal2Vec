        "\nYou Against You is musically one of the stronger cuts from the bloated and underwhelming Repentless. A modernised version of Slayer's signature chaotic sound is present here, but there are some twists in this track apart from its very standard and run-of-the-mill place as a Slayer song. The slower intro introduces the track with a heavy groove and a very abrupt start-stop verse that foreshadows the rising of the intensity of the bulk of the song.\n\nWhat improves this song by a landslide is the final minute or so, wherein Gary Holt plays an actual solo, two of them actually, proving it can be done in a Slayer song. The nuances in his playing express some genuine emotion among the aggression, and this is solidified by a devastating riff that ends the song, and shows much more impact than the main riff, which is catchy but a bit too simple to be used as excessively as it is in this track. I feel like You Against You is less of an individual song and more of a demonstration of Slayer's basic, formulaic songwriting at its core in order to push the whole Killogy thing which I thought was dumb. Even though this song it just good, it's still one of the better cuts from Repentless.\n",
        "\nare a few hits and a handful of misses following Seasons In The Abyss, World Painted Blood is one that I see as a massive hit. With the bias of this being released shortly before I got into them, I also find the songwriting itself to be exceptionally better than anything presented in the final twenty or so years of their career. Obviously, Tom and co. show their age, but their ability to wear it is what\u2019s impressive; this is especially obvious seeing that they opted to leave in not one, but two voice cracks.\n\nBy wearing it well, I mean there isn\u2019t a clear aim at sounding relevant to the current hot style. Instead, it\u2019s just their beefiest abilities to write compelling riffs and memorable choruses, alongside fun tactics to stand out. There\u2019s certainly no shortage of sloppy Kerry King solos, but like with the classics, this really isn\u2019t the focus. It\u2019s a healthy mix of crushing thrash aggression and strong leads being tossed back and forth. If that isn\u2019t enough, the drumming here is stellar, and they\u2019ve ditched the obnoxious noisy gradient that plagued God Hates Us All and a bit of Christ Illusion.\n\nThe heavier \u201cthrashers\u201d take precedence by blending their older style with an unapologetic aged approach. \u201cUnit 731,\u201d a bloody tale on some of imperialist Japan\u2019s worst war crimes, drills this heavily into the grooves, taking a straightforward approach and adding in suspense. The banger \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d is even more stripped down, and Tom\u2019s older vocal approach just gives it charm, which can also be said about \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d and it\u2019s blistering ascent. Some areas on these songs definitely get a bit heavy handed, like the bridges in \u201cSnuff,\u201d but that song itself still smokes.\n\nOn the other hand, the title track encapsulates a structure built more on phases, and this is truly the best example of the writing that allows speed metal passages to blend in evenly with suspense, breakdown, and poetic lyrics. Another personal favorite is \u201cBeauty Through Order,\u201d coating on doomy layers and slow crawls that lead to a furious charge. Even \u201cAmericon\u201d has a bit of a calmer nature to it, weaponizing this tactic to its greatest degree. The only strikingly weak points are the two album closers that couldn\u2019t be more obvious filler if they tried. Had the record ended with \u201cPsychopathy Red,\u201d this would stack up right beside the \u201880s releases.\n\nBut ultimately, World Painted Blood is such a jewel in the rough. While other later \u2018era records certainly had their high points (some more than others), not a single one of them delivered the way this one does. The politically charged and religious hatred is as present as ever, but never does it feel edgy or overdone, something Slayer had been guilty of before as well. For those that haven\u2019t dusted this disc off in a while, I strongly recommend a revisit.\n",
        "\nAfter \"Reign in Blood\", it was difficult to imagine what can still be done after such a colossal release. What else is there to brutality-based thrash metal after that!? Well, the answer is that it does not have to be the same type of release. Slayer knew that, and they decided to change things up a little bit. The successor, \"South of Heaven\" became something totally different than any of the records before it. While \"Reign in Blood\" makes one forget about all the reasons that exist, all the logic that exists, and makes the listener an absolute slave to the record, logically, it is extremely one-sided. This record is not the same way in that regard. That's why, this record, South of Heaven, because its variety and diversity, logically is the best Slayer record of all time. \n\nThe style of the album is still very much Slayer, as we know and love it. The major difference here has to do with speed. Just when the record begins with the haunting intro riff of \"South of Heaven\", the listener already realizes this is something different, and it's true, the song is rather slow for a first song on a thrash record. However, it is just as powerful. The riffs are very dark, and they do have that particular Slayer-type aggression to them, regardless of the slow pace. This is true to the other songs, such as \"Live Undead\", or \"Read Between the Lies\", these songs are slow pace-wise, but the colorfulness and the dark melodies grab the listener just as well as high-speed songs, like \"Ghosts of War\", and \"Slient Scream\". Whether you're into slower thrash, or traditional, high-speed thrash, this is for you. Both styles are encompassed by the record, and they are magnificently nailed. \n\nThe reason why all types of songs are extremely well-done lies in the songwriting, obviously. Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King decided to go in a different direction this time. Except for the debuting \"Show no Mercy\", Slayer's records have been all based on brutality and speed. It's true, no one could get enough of Slayer's mindless devastation, and that led to the extreme success and status of \"Hell Awaits\" and \"Reign in Blood\", both of which are some of the best thrash records ever. However, it was clear that one more record based on just speed, and the formula wears out. Realizing this, Jeff and Kerry turned to different tools. They realized that the slow pace actually allows them to squeeze a lot of notes in there, and write very energetic, very \"alive\" riffs. A good example of this is the first verse riff in \"Live Undead\", or even the intro riff of the title song. They were also able to carry the classic, skeleton-like dark, Slayer melodies over to the slow songs as well, so they all sound just as heavy and mean as the fast songs of the band.\n\nBut those that expected something from the older days of Slayer shouldn't be disappointed, either. \"Ghosts of War\" or \"Cleanse the Soul\" crush just as hard as anything that has been released before. The album finds the perfect balance between this new, slower-paced idea of the members of Slayer, and the classic Slayer vibe. Besides the axemen, drummer Dave Lombardo puts on one hell of a show. This has to be one of the greatest drum performances in the history of thrash metal. He just goes above and beyond of what would \"suffice\", and does is perfectly. He doesn't go overboard, either, and his fills are colorful. Obviously, his double-pedal game is also top-notch, like usual. Tom Araya also kicks an insane amount of ass with the deliverance of these lyrics. Like before, he is fierce, aggressive and hateful. Every member reaches the top musically on this record.\n\nHow is is possible that there is a FOURTH album that is just magnificent and perfect, by the same band? It's hard to comprehend Slayer's killing spree from 1983 to 1990, as the band was just way above everyone else in terms of every different regard. \"Effective\" is a good way to describe Slayer's way of songwriting. Slayer is fast, but clearly not the fastest. Slayer is catchy, but not the catchiest. Slayer is evil, but they are not the most evil. However, Slayer is extremely \"good\" at all aspects of thrash metal, and when you have a band that is not the best, but extremely good, and they don't fall short on anything, it is understandable that they rise above all else. This is true for every record they released in the 80s, including South of Heaven.\n",
        "\nThere used to be an old lie amongst fans and journalists that Slayer \u201cnever changed much\u201d/\u201dnever sold out\u201d etc (which was normally framed alongside a comment about their lack of haircuts [Kerry grew his hair bald, don\u2019t you know?]). And yes, when we compare them to certain other bands of their ilk, sure, they never made such drastic shifts. But still, we probably ought to consider that the band went from writing the most menacing metal around, draped in chilling occultism and harrowing tales of real life horror, to the band that wrote nu metal-tinged tracks about\u2026 rugby? At any rate, the way I perceive Divine Intervention\u2019s reputation depends almost entirely on whether you compare it to what came before it or the dross that followed. If you compare it to any Slayer material post-1994, Divine Intervention is a refreshing, somewhat entertaining thrash metal album that has some strong elements. However, if you compare it what came before: the album simply lacks a direction, purpose and raison d\u2019etre other than simply \u201cbeing Slayer\u201d. \n\nSo, does the album help usher in the band known as \u201cZombie Slayer\u201d? Well, I probably need to clarify what zombie Slayer is first. Whilst Slayer proper were undoubtedly one of the greatest metal bands ever, Zombie Slayer \u2013 much like their spiritual soulmates Zombie Simpsons \u2013 is a pastiche of former glories. The hallmarks of Zombie Slayer (which existed for longer than the Slayer we love, before finally being taken back behind the shed and put out of its drawn-out suffering) are usually: shouty, shouty vocals, re-cycled riffs that desperately milk a thinning musical vocabulary, lyrics that might shock but in reality say very little and the odd flirtation with the current musical zeitgeist/and/or an embarrassingly adolescent twinge to the writing (\u2018Disciple\u2019, \u201cyeah, he fucking hates me \u2013 no, mom, I won\u2019t talk out the damn trash\u201d). In short: Zombie Slayer were terrible because it was everything Fucking Excellent Life-Affirming Slayer were not. Mundane, stale and toothless. \n\nSo, into which camp does Divine Intervention fall? \n\nWell, truth be told, neither is appropriate. Whilst the writing might have been on the wall with certain tracks on Seasons in the Abyss and its apparent lack of new direction (every prior Slayer album had been radically different), it was still a classic Slayer album in many ways. I mean, the title-track is masterfully ominous and the attention to detail is brilliant (Lombardo\u2019s drums, brilliant solos and weird touches like that \u201cjackboots across Europe\u201d marching sound in \u2018War Ensemble\u2019). Divine Intervention is simply not good enough when compared to any prior Slayer release. However, it\u2019s also not mind-numbingly dull and, therefore, not bad enough to be Zombie Slayer, even if it might be the sound of a band nearing their \u201csell-by\u201d date. \n\nI\u2019ve heard people say this album bears certain elements of the \u201cKerry King likes Slipknot\u201d modern flirtations that the next two Slayer albums would be marred by. However, if this is the case, it\u2019s quite a subtle element. It\u2019s certainly true that 1994\u2019s musical landscape was greatly different to 1990\u2019s \u2013 but it appears that Slayer were largely indifferent to this. By this point, they\u2019ve heard Chaos AD but perhaps their copies of Burn My Eyes were still in the post? So, the sounds of the 1990s are creeping in \u2013 but very gently at this point (most notably in the dreaded use of vocal distortion on Araya\u2019s surprisingly ho-hum performance on this album). What is evident is that Kerry King is the main writer on this album, and it is apparent that Kerry is very much a fan of Slayer, hence the album\u2019s self-referential, \u201cSlayer for Slayer\u2019s sake\u201d tone. What\u2019s further apparent is that \u2013 just as you can\u2019t really replace Dave Lombardo with Paul Bostaph \u2013 you can\u2019t replace Hannemann\u2019s dark genius with Kerry\u2019s more workmanlike when it comes to the heavy lifting of the writing (certainly, King was capable of greatness, too, just have a look at the writing credits on Reign in Blood). Which gets us to the other big issue here: by 1994, Hannemann\u2019s muse had already left him. King is obviously left to pick up the slack and, in fairness, does a decent job, but you really can\u2019t have classic Slayer without Hannemann\u2019s exceptional talents. \n\nCertainly, you could make a case for King\u2019s writing being perhaps stronger than Hannemann\u2019s contributions here, and that \u2013 in itself \u2013 is a bad omen. The title-track is probably one of the strongest tracks here, but also feels somewhat headless; it\u2019s a Slayer song, clearly channelling some of the South of Heaven gloom (which is probably the direction Slayer should have pursued after their glory days \u2013 imagine that: a dignified, dark and thoughtful band, rather than a shouty, adolescent Viagra thrash one, sounds better, right?). But does it have anything on any of the bands previously masterful title-tracks? I think we all know the answer to that. At any rate, however, the disembodied tone and gloomy atmosphere are well done, but given Araya\u2019s quite poor vocals \u2013 it\u2019s pleasing but not mandatory. Elsewhere, \u2018Dittohead\u2019 is a pleasant thrasher: even with its dodgy talk radio tone (again, was this another ill-omen that they were on the road to writing songs about rugby?), it ticks the boxes for a decent Slayer song. However, the whole tone of the song: riffs, lyrics, 7/10 intensity would suggest that by 1994 Slayer had long been surpassed as the titans of extremity in metal (I mean, which is the better album Deicide or Legion or Seasons in the Abyss?). Elsewhere, it\u2019s not embarrassing but \u2013 more often than not \u2013 merely passable exercises in Slayerisms rather than truly inspired stuff. We\u2019re almost on to a checklist of typical tropes: serial killers, Nazis, horror, slower, moody numbers and songs that are fast without Reign in Blood\u2019s menace. \n\nUltimately, Divine Intervention has an air of \u201cfor fans\u201d and it might be an album you visit sporadically. Certainly, not the most embarrassing album by a similar band in this era (remember when Megadeth suddenly started looking like extras on Friends?) \u2013 but the sound of a band slowly shuffling off into the distance.\n",
        "\nSlayer is my favorite thrash metal band. It takes something special to attain the #1 position, as the thrash scene provides a practically endless amount of great, amazingly talented bands. Slayer's brutality, force, aggression however managed to lift the band above all else. Albums like South of Heaven, Hell Awaits, Seasons in the Abyss are all records that rip apart the rest of the scene alive, with few exceptions.\n\nWith the release of \"Seasons in the Abyss\", the Golden Age of Slayer has ended. Then came the still quite good \"Divine Intervnetion\", but it was nowhere near any of the band's previous albums. After that, skipping 'Undisputed Attitude\", came the infamous \"Diabolus in Musica\", which was a huge decline in every way possible. It abolished traditional thrash metal, it did away with everything the original fans loved the band for. However, it was still fairly listenable. It was not enjoyable, but listenable. Following, the band decided to release something that does all the things Diabolus in Musica did, with one difference. This one isn't even listenable.\n\nThe music on the record is inspired by the likes of Slipknot and/or Korn, none of which should be of any inspiration for a band of Slayer's caliber. Why they chose to follow those types of bands is beyond me, but it was one horrible decision. They dumbed down the music to the same type of slimy, sluggish, muddy fumbling in primitivity, with minimal amount of creativity. The riffs are ultra-simple, and they are just plain stupid. The notes are in no relation with each other. They don't communicate anything. As if someone was just improvising over a backing track with nothing in mind, and they released whatever was played for the first time. Nothing contains even 10% of the strength that can be found in the band's first 4 releases.\n\nAnd things yet worse yet. The percussion is also rather simplistic. Surely, it is unfair to expect the level of drumming wizardry that Lombardo was able to provide, practically nobody else can do that. However, this is way below average, there aren't a lot of fills, not a lot of patterns, the drums are barely noticeable. Let's not forget Tom Araya, who is actually nailing what the idea was here, but the idea wasn't right. The type of screaming-yelling, pathetic-sounding, powerless, weak nu-metal vocals are absolutely repulsive even when they are the original performers of the idea. Imagine the ripoff version. \n\nThank God, Slayer didn't continue this route after this record. With the release of \"Christ Illusion\", they returned to their roots, and while the record was quite dull, it was at least Slayer. At least, it was fierce, aggressive, hateful, and it was thrash metal. It cannot be overstated how pathetic this record turned out to be, and it is absolutely the lowest point of the almighty Slayer's career. But it is easy to forgive them, when they released some of the greatest thrash metal records in the history of the Universe, and they realized this just doesn't work. They returned to their former self.\n",
        "\nHey, did you notice how bad 1990s was to metal music (to more known bands, at least)? Grunge and nu-metal emerged; say no more! If you were a metalhead through those turbulent times, of course the effect was totally felt. Even Slayer turned, or were commanded to turn towards studio crew who mostly came outside metal music, and perhaps that way forced to yield to 1990s alternative rock sounds.\n\nLet's begin from the package, because... it has signs... The band logo looks something completely different, starting with a section sign (\u00a7). The cover art which consists of black and white photography that might be upsetting and ghastly to some eyes, doesn't scream \"SLAYER.\" Not at all. The title of the album does, though. However, the signs are there in the open.\n\nWhen hearing this, it is clear that it's Slayer playing; they just sound Slayer together, no doubt about that (even though it is Paul Bostaph again behind the kit). Even if the music is mostly a lot slower than Slayer at their fastest, it still can be tight at best here. However, so often it is stripped of that anger, that motherfucking slaying fury. It is still loud, okay, but it sounds like guys were feeling the sun in their jacuzzis, probably having some beers or enjoying family company, and forgot to feel angry. The anger level isn't higher than, let's say, Mudvayne, on the nu-tinged songs. So, I presume it was told by the band's management or record label to make some sonics that would make nu-metal fanatics throw down their burgers and put on the hood and go sway to this. Wouldn't have been the first time, nor the last...\n\nI never wanted Slayer to go and sound Korn-ish. The other way around would have been okay. And hey, I can enjoy some early Korn. It's just a bad marriage here, this way around. I mean I've commanded my brain to act like I wasn't listening to Slayer here, but it cannot be done. When I get closest to that point, I can enjoy them looser beats, but I really cannot enjoy the most simplistic guitar work. Bostaph does fine, even during the slowest parts, plus he's throwing out loads of different beats and tricks. Bad ass guy! But those guitaaarrrrrghs: If former Slayer stuff was made by engineers, the simple stuff here was on caveman-level in comparison. The drums feel alive, the guitars feel lame for a big time, even though there are some old school shredding happening.\n\nWhile there are some good riffs and melody processions here, about all of them pale when contrasting to past music from the band. This is the Slayer album where they began to rehash their stuff. The opener, 'Bitter Peace' penned by Jeff Hanneman, has a slow start, but explodes into a typical Slayer song, which I like; it is one of the most energetic and vicious things packed herein (yep, those more familiar-sounding bits can be angry... or angry-ish). But alas, it is already the second track (also by Hanneman) where things get so much more blunt and cleansed, and this time with slow ending which really does not fit with the first part. It contains some bits that try to be as evil as 'Dead Skin Mask', but fuck no (for another example, try 'Desire'; partly with similar vocals even). 'Stain of Mind', the first Kerry King song is more nu-metal tinted with its funky (?!) groove. And the vocals, then... Tom Araya (also on bass guitar) is in his old beastly form at times, but then we also got more suitable rhythmic spoken vocals, too. On more like a rap/metal song hybrid, 'Overt Enemy', the vocals are effected. You can expect loads of guitar effects/sounds, too, and often from the domain of nu-metal and alternative rock...\n\nSo, what we got was a less vicious and cleaned-up Slayer, even though 'Perversions of Pain' and 'Scrum' are like simplified tracks in previous album's vein. Even the lyrics seem somewhat less brutal, even though war and sick human minds make the main content. This has some better moments, but not a whole song is such. I can listen to this, but together with its sequel, 2001's 'God Hates Us All', it's often left on shelf. The production is raw-ish and of the band's heaviest up to this album. Not as raw as 'Divine Intervention', though. The sound is considerably different when the band do caveman-stuff. Some of the drums sound rubbery (like toms with loose skins, plus kick drums), as does the bass. Then add them guitar effects... Feel like listening to some lost songs of \"Judgment Night\" soundtrack. It's a weird production. Who knows, maybe the band themselves wanted to try something different, and not the record label money makers.\n\n1994's 'Divine Intervention' was a change in Slayer's sound, due to Dave Lombardo leaving. It was a brutal slab of wrath, if you ask me. I think none of their fans expected the band go partly nu and this modern after that album. Well, it happened and left a big stain in minds of many, many Slayer fanatic. The band never returned to their former high levels again, even though they did put out a couple of considerably better albums. Easy to point out now, but that's how it went, and since guitarist Hanneman isn't in this level of existence anymore, we probably won't hear more from Slayer. If this had a different band name (or performers) on it, I think it would have been welcomed much better. I have undeniably heard worse things...\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nNow, is it really live?\n\nSlayer is a band I think alot of people agree sound better live than in the studio, a live setting gives the band ALOT of room to flesh out and flex it's muscles, and is just generally more roomy.\n\nThis is not an example of that.\n\n\"Live Undead\" was recorded infront of some close friends and fans of Slayer in-studio. It's less of a live recording and more of a not-overdubbed studio recording. That doesn't make the record any less fantastic, however, as I'd argue this is Slayer's best output over their entire career. This is them in one of their rawest forms. Tom Araya never did a better vocal job, Dave Lombardo never did a better drum job.\n\nStarting out the record we get some crowd noise before Kerry King plays the opening note to the first song of the set. \"Black Magic\". I've seen many claim this is their favorite version of BM, however I prefer the Show No Mercy version *just* a little more. That does not take away from the performance of course, Tom Araya arguably does a better vocal job here than any other version, and Dave Lombardo's cymbals sound so much more natural here. They really *clash* and fit right in with the groove of the guitars. Tom screams like a maniac here, only outmatched on his performance on Reign In Blood.\n\nOne thing I'd like to complain about is how short the album is. It's practically a live EP rather than an album. I understand, this was performed in-studio, but I fail to see why they couldn't have performed songs like \"Tormentor\" or \"Metal Storm\". A performance of \"Haunting The Chapel\" could've been appreciated as well. 23 minutes is too low of a time for me to fully enjoy the sound, the speed, and the aggressiveness of this album. Every song feels as if it's over as soon as it begins, and it's the only big reason I'm giving this a 97 instead of an 100%.\n\nBack to positives, the guitar tone is excellent. There's a certain mid-80's charm to it not found on any other Slayer record, really. It's clear they had a much bigger budget for this record then on Show No Mercy, as such the production is much higher and things such as drums and bass are alot clearer than their debut. Damn you Brian Slagel for making Tom use his own money for production, SNM coulda sounded like this!\n\nDespite only having 7 songs, I'll admit they pick some good songs here, albeit a few are overplayed these days (mainly The Antichrist). Black Magic works well as an opener and Tom's little quip before beginning Die By The Sword (\"They say the pen is mightier then the sword, well I say fuck the pen!\") gets a chuckle out of me everytime I listen to it. I'm gonna go by the assumption there was a real crowd here, and they were just in a studio, rather then them being added in later and say they are very energetic here. I would have loved to be in the crowd of this show, as it's more excited and energetic then 70% of metal shows I go to.\n\nMy favorite song has to be the ending song, \"Aggressive Perfector\". Undoubtedly my favorite version of the song, Araya never screamed this high again, his scream at the end gives me chills. Hanneman really shines in guitar-work, chugging out riff after riff, creating synchronized chaos with Dave Lombardo, who sounds like he's smashing the very drumkit he's playing infront of the crowd. While the shortest song of the set, it's leaves you chilled and, forgive my corniness, rocked, out of the album.\n\nOverall, Live Undead is Slayer's best output, and while not \"live\" by most standards, it's good enough for me to give it a perfectly fitting, nice and round, 97%.\n\n-Someone who's rather grateful, and somewhat dead inside.\n",
        "\nI get the idea behind this record. Slayer became a legendary band in the 1980s and sort of completed the thrash game. With nothing more to prove, they could instead experiment to a larger degree. With the punk cover record Undisputed Attitude, Slayer was able to pay tribute to bands that had fallen somewhat into neglect. Some of them even originate from the same area as Slayer.\n\nSo here we have a slew of punk/hardcore songs, sometimes with two tunes crammed into one track. I grew up with some of these songs, and listened to TSOL and Minor Threat before I listened to Slayer. Now, I'm not saying that TSOL and Minor Threat are musical gods, not even remotely so. In fact, I would say that Slayer slay them all. However, they slayed more in the 1980s and 1990 than in the mid-1990s.\n\nFor me, Undisputed Attitude falls somewhat flat, owing to two flaws. First, Slayer's sound doesn't necessarily translate super-well into punk, and on this record they even did the opposite of augmenting (disaugmenting?) their sound. In particular, the vocals are atrocious.\n\nA thick layer of distortion was added to Araya's vocals in the production. This \"trick\" was probably borrowed from the contemporary groove and industrial music that thrash had devolved into by 1996. I don't like sound that this production yielded; I don't see that it adds anything to his voice; and when Araya's vocal input is as one-dimensional as it the case here, it doesn't rectify the situation either. He screams and screams throughout most of the record. He ends up as sounding naggy, rather than brutal, heavy or menacing.\n\nThe punk acts which Slayer cover here were hardcore bands, who played fast, but at the same time their soundscapes weren't an all-out sonic attack. The original songs were more playful and didn't insist on being so hard all the time. Listen to \"Abolish Government\", for instance. I just think the original has a more interesting sound than the screamfest we're treated with here. The low point is \"I Don't Want to Hear It\" which gets mumbly, repetitive and boring. I'd much rather listen to The Suicide Machines' ska cover of the tune.\n\nRight after said low point, though, starts a string of better tracks. On \"Spiritual Law\", \"Mr. Freeze\" and \"Richard Hung Himself\", Slayer treat us with more variation in song structure and vocal style. The record might have been better if these, and maybe 1-2 in the same vein, were more scattered throughout the record.\n\nIn addition to the covers, two of the songs were written by Slayer members for punk side-projects. One of them is decent, while \"Can't Stand You\" is lame with lyrics dumber than usual. Lastly, there is one \"real\" Slayer song on here, the last one, \"Gemini\". It would not be out of place on Seasons in the Abyss, with its eerie vocals.\n\nWithout bashing on punk in any way, I must say that \"Gemini\" is the best written song on here. Also, while i'm sure the guys had fun blasting out this record, they fail to present a compelling reason why we shouldn't just listen to the originals.\n",
        "\nI have bought a few old CDs recently and thus had some nice reminiscences when listening to some tunes again, after all these years. It\u2019s interesting to take a fresh look at a record you\u2019ve known for so long. Suddenly you know what should have been done differently for this particular album to sound more powerful. Some albums survive time trials, some appear laughable (at least in some aspects). Let\u2019s take a look at a Slayer album I picked up on CD lately (I\u2019ve had it on a cassette tape since 1994). I remember that anticipations were damn high in 1994, for two reasons at least. Firstly, it was a follow up to highly acclaimed Seasons In the Abyss. Secondly, it was Slayer\u2019s first album without Dave Lombardo behind the drum kit. I also remember that Divine Intervention was advertized as \u2018a new Reign In Blood\u2019...\n\nThe first track on this record had been premiered on MTV\u2019s Headbangers\u2019 Ball some time before the album\u2019s release during reports from the recording studio. Instantly, the focus is on drums as if the band wanted to introduce Bostaph to the fans. So, this is what our new drummer is capable of, stop mourning Lombardo\u2019s departure finally! \u201cKilling Fields\u201d is one of the album\u2019s strongest assets, with one major fault, though: drum sound. Kick drum\u2019s fine, but snare drum must have later become an inspiration for the producer of St. Anger (notice: I don\u2019t have this issue with other songs on Divine Intervention). Aside for that, a great tune. Next two tracks do little good or bad for the album. They are fine, but they just flow by. Especially the fast-paced punk-influenced \u201cSex, Murder, Art\u201d (Tom Araya had these words on his t-shirt on many contemporary photos). \u201cFictional Reality\u201d could blend in among songs on Seasons In the Abyss, next to \u201cSkeletons of Society\u201d perhaps. \"Dittohead\u201d \u2013 the first single off the album and Kerry King\u2019s middle finger pointed at politicians and social parasites. Something must\u2019ve been in the air in 1994, remember how Pantera\u2019s Far Beyond Driven album started? \u201cDittohead\u201d played in 2021 has the same lethal power \u2013 probably the fastest Slayer song ever, a perfect mix of thrash and punk, with emphasis on the former. As if to balance things out, the title song follows in form of a slow/medium paced \u2018crawler\u2019 with the focus on creating eerie atmosphere, not in the way it was done on Dead Skin Mask, though. Still, it is one of the album\u2019s best. Here I used to turn the tape over to hear Side B of the album. It\u2019s a symbolic act in case of Divine Intervention, as songs 6-10 (okay, 6-9) have less striking power than tunes on the first half of the album. \u201cCircle of Beliefs\u201d is not compact enough, \u201cSS-3\u201d sways between listenable and mediocre, \u201cSerenity in Murder\u201d and \u201c213\u201d shouldn\u2019t be placed next to each other, as they blend together into a 7+ minute snooze fest interrupted by the final torpedo, \u201cMind Control\u201d, one of my favorite Slayer tunes.\n\nThe band (esp. King, who wrote most of the songs) often blamed Divine Intervention\u2019s failure to achieve success comparable to that of its predecessor on weak production. After all these years, I doubt that it\u2019s the only reason why this album hadn\u2019t received a warm embrace from all fans. Of course, it doesn\u2019t sound as powerful as Seasons, but I believe the main issue is with the quality of songwriting in the second part of the album. Perhaps if Jeff had participated more, if King had placed the puzzle pieces closer together, etc., etc. \n\nI feel obliged to point out to the awesome front cover artwork; undoubtedly Slayer\u2019s finest album cover, one standing out not only in the band\u2019s discography, but also among other albums crowding store shelves. At the same time, everyone looking at it immediately knew it was a Slayer album \u2013 the record company must\u2019ve seen that too, cause there is no band name or album title anywhere on the front. It needs also to be noted that DI is Slayer\u2019s last album before going \u2018modern\u2019 with their sound and songwriting. I personally blame Machine Head\u2019s emergence for that \u2013 they debuted with Burn My Eyes in...1994 and embarked on a world tour supporting\u2026Slayer. Machine Head hype was so huge at that moment on the Old Continent that fans of the support act printed their own tour posters with MH\u2019s logo much bigger than Slayer\u2019s. Kerry King also seemed to sense that the \u2018wind of change\u2019 started blowing into a \u2018nu\u2019 direction and the rest is history. \n\nBottomline: Divine Intervention will always fade in comparison to the band\u2019s first 5 studio albums, but provides sudden refreshment when heard in the context of post 1994 Slayer. It\u2019s a good thrash album released at the time when most 80\u2019s thrashers had already gone soft and groove/post-thrash bands started growing in popularity.\n",
        "\nOne of the things I've been doing lately is collecting full discographies of bands I really, really enjoy. Of course, one has to draw the line somewhere, so I stick with just LPs and EPs. Stuff like live albums or splits or videos/DVDs are optional little extra content purely for beefing up the collection. I've been able to realize the completion of several bands over the years like Metallica, Disturbed, Superjoint Ritual, and Volbeat, just to name a few. Some bands I'm sickeningly close to finishing but, are incomplete because of one EP or album that is forever elusive for one reason or another (e.g. out of print, hard to find, import only, etc.). With the purchase of Reign in Blood earlier this week, Slayer's discography is now officially complete for me. However, in the case of the almighty Slayer, their first live album here had to be included for the sake of completion. \n\nWith a lot of these albums from the past by these legacy bands, I'm a stranger to. My being only 29 doesn't lend much credibility when I'm asked about the reverential status these albums have because likely, I'm only familiar with them by it being passed around peripherally in conversation by other metalheads. Don't worry, everybody, I'm updating and spit shining my metal card with every album successively compiled onto my ever expanding library. This album, even though it's considered to be a live recording, I feel it has to be included as canon in the discography as something of a \"must have\" given how early it was in the band's career and it being officially released by Metal Blade. So there's the justification. Now onto the music.\n\nOf course, being this was released in '84, the same year as the Haunting the Chapel EP (the EP came out first), the original four horseman are here: King, Araya, Lombardo, and Hanneman. There's absolutely no denying the unparalleled level of energy on display. They're all in their 20s. They're rapacious and hungry for blood. They were on the cusp of becoming a force to be reckoned with but, that would have to wait with the following two masterpieces of Hell Awaits and Reign in Blood. They're all in top form. I don't need to explain just how phenomenal this sounds, how masterful the playing is. This is Slayer in their absolute prime. Nothing can top the ferocity that's felt when you hear Tom Araya hitting those piercing falsettos or when he gives that fucking amazing delivery before \"Die by the Sword\" starts, neither can you deny the tight chemistry between Hanneman and King as they trade solos back and forth, and the tight tight TIGHT double bass groove that Lombardo belts out on \"Captor of Sin\" is undeniable in how amazing it is. Classic songs from the EP and debut all played with the tightness, skill, and no-holds-barred energy you'd expect from this band in the mid-80s.\n\nNow onto the big elephant in the room. It's not a true live album. Well, that's debatable. I'm not sure exactly what set of circumstances led to the band to go the approach they did but, from what I read, it wasn't good. Something went horribly wrong along the way and, thus, enter the studio crowd. There's clearly real Slayer devotees involved in the booth and, obviously, there's fury and passion for the band's music. In fairness to the producers who orchestrated this, I'm preferable to this method as opposed to a fake canned crowd pulled from a soundboard. Still, though, I cannot escape the fact that's a real crowd in a sound studio that feels as if it was added in post-production. For me, it almost ruined the whole experience. Thankfully the music was so amazing, it was a pleasant enough distraction from the fact the was an artificially inserted crowd, albeit composed of real people. That's about all. I don't know what else to say that hasn't been said already. It's a live Slayer album released alongside the pantheon of their first three albums and their EP released in the 80s.\n",
        "\nMaybe people don't find a difference between the old Slayer and the new Slayer, but there's a lot. What makes that difference less obvious is that the group has remained true to their origins despite some changes. Although their former travel partners such as Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth or Testament have been filing rough edges, Slayer has continued to bet on constant aggressiveness, as they've always continued to kick the world and make their performances a true battlefield, something that many old thrash bands have been losing out over the years. Now the puzzle is complete, Lombardo added the so necessary sound, so the raid sounds like before and the double bass drums fill again, then those characteristic breaks shine again at their finest. Obviously, all this has influenced them, making Tom Araya's bass a more solid instrument and allowing the guitars to expand as they haven't done in a long time.\n\nMost tracks have some nasty twist, so to speak, but the overall album's line holds off the vibe pretty well. Something also noticeable is the great difference between Hanneman's and King's songwriting. Hanneman's three songs are literally abominable, especially \u201cEyes Of The Insane\u201d, a very modern and kind of bland song, while \u201cJihad\u201d sounds a bit better as it has some interesting changes, but it doesn't arrive, so the most salvageable is \u201cBlack Serenade\u201d, a song with some very good riffs that is vaguely reminiscent of \u201cMandatory Suicide\u201d and is more in keeping with album's main approach.\n\nThis attempt at approaching \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d is evident in some songs. \u201cSkeleton Christ\u201d is committed to the density so present at times. In any case, the true protagonist \"Confearacy\" is simply devastating. \"Catalyst\" and \"Cult\" continue to sweep, despite the fact that these last two have some forgettable ruptures. \"Supremist\" is the strangest one, it's interesting and horrible in equal parts, and as soon as you listen to the riff that seems straight out of Show No Mercy, you find yourself in the middle of a Machine Head vibe. This kind of tangle makes the song difficult to digest and it goes rather unnoticed within the album content.\n\nAs far as the sound level is concerned, this is a point I don't want to overlook. The album is not bad, but drums have been very hidden, although the doubles bass can be heard clearly; the kick drum is very hidden, just like the box. Rhythm guitars sound a bit dumpy, but on the contrary, solos and riffs sound crisp and with more presence. Undoubtedly a somewhat atypical production, although I don't like it at all as a whole, it results decent though. Overall it's strong and makes sound the group very compact.\n\nChrist Illusion is somewhat close to Seasons In The Abyss and South Of Heaven. Above all, the difference lies in the denser songs, which on this occasion they're not as lucky as \u201cSkeletons Of Society\u201d, \u201cSeasons In The Abyss\u201d or \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d as they were in their day. Anyway, taking into account their previous releases, \"Christ Illusion\" is not a bad album, it has very good songs and the total compendium gives hope to this possible return of authentic Slayers. It's also a short and concise album, 38 minutes of uncompromising aggression, as it has to be.\n",
        "\nThe title of this can be understood in several ways. For one, the genuinely horrifying and blood-freezing album cover of this record is crowned with the goat-like devil on a throne, that's being carried by some evil forces. Another meaning of the title is an abbreviation for \"The Greatest of All Time\", and I am not just joking. I give 100% to a lot of different thrash albums, because for me, the ones that get a perfect score all took me to an alternate reality, and show me heights of metal music I have never experienced before. Each perfect album in its own way. However, if I was to only give one single 100%, in the entire genre of thrash metal, this would be it right here. No doubts, no questions. \n\nSince the evil and hellish Hell Awaits, Slayer decided to take yet another dive deep down into hell, but go even more extreme. Go even deeper, go faster, go harder, go in more detail. The result is absolutely breathtaking. It is simply the most devastating, most explosive, most hateful, gory dose of lethal thrash metal that ever saw the face of this Earth. The record is simply unable to ease up from suffocating the listener as powerfully as possible and throwing the listener into a whirlwind after whirlwind. Simply, there are no breaks from the unrelenting demolition. The opener \"Angel of Death\" already rips your head off with its cutting riffs and brutal tempo, but the album just gets more and more insane and brutal. The songs get faster, and faster, and even faster than the last one, and more chaotic, and harsher. As you progress through the record, the deeper you get into hell. \n\nIt is very hard to describe the music on this record. Slayer is so dear for a lot of metalheads because no band has been more successful at describing the suffering of souls, and demonstrating what it's like to mentally suffer in great pain. They managed to put those things in the form of music. Jeff Hanneman's and Kerry King's riffs are just mindblowing, and contrarily to popular belief, they are extremely difficult. Maybe not when you copy them off a tab, but to come up with these riffs, perfectly match them to the theme, follow them up with the next highly coherent riff that serves the same purpose as the previous one but sounds different... Try it one time, if you think it's that simple. This is some of the most devastating guitar work in history. The riffs are evil and remain very deep and dark throughout the entire record. They are meaningful and truly tell a story, along with the guitar leads. In this case, the guitar solos shouldn't be taken as regular guitar solos. They should be considered as one component of the whole mix, but not anything that on its own, will go anywhere. I understand that this is why people hate on Slayer's guitar solos, but that's okay. There is a learning curve involved in enjoying the highest levels of thrash metal music, and looking at the size of the Slayer fanbase, some people went through it already.\n\nLet's not forget the unforgettable performances of the balance of the band either. Dave Lombardo really shows why he is considered to be the best thrash metal drummer of all time by many. His fills are just extremely well-placed and rich, his double-bass technique is of course God-like, and his hi-hat is constantly crushing, there is no idling when it comes to Dave Lombardo. Tom Araya has been always providing an at least okay performance since the beginning of Slayer, so he also doesn't disappoint on this record, either. His vocals on this record are unbelievably masterful. He doesn't go overboard, he isn't high-pitched, he is also not growling, this is the gold standard of thrash metal vocals. Everyone on this record has given the greatest performance of their lives, and they easily blow away any thrash metal album in existence with their unrelenting aggression and brutality, which at the end of the day, are what thrash metal is all about. \n\nWhat can you say about this record... It is not surprising that some people don't like it, because Slayer made a very divisive decision by cutting down the song lengths, dedicating the entire album to gore, darkness, evil, and all the rest. Clearly, not everyone wanted this. However, I am opened to most things a band wants to do if it fits their genre, and man did this attempt exceed all thrash efforts in history... It sure did, and no band has ever been able to even get close to the intensity, to the musical violence, to the brutal destruction that this record is able to provide in about 7-8 minutes already. People are simply unable to get on this level, and they all sound less catchy, less eager to kill everything, less lethal than Slayer here on Reign in Blood. It sounds as if someone looked at thrash metal as a genre, took everything he knew about it, and squeezed it into 28 minutes of pure madness. The greatest creation of our kind in this style of music.\n",
        "\nAfter the excellent, marvelous metal classic, \"Show No Mercy\", Slayer did not waste a lot of time entering the world of darkness and evil. This record marks the beginning of the era from which Slayer developed their gory, dark, brutal identity that's a lot more shocking and aggressive than anyone in the American Big 4. What Slayer managed to unload on the unsuspecting victims (no warnings no signs) who dared to listen to this record is just unbelievable. The world has not often seen this much aggression, this much hatred, and hellish destruction before. This approach on this record has later been taken to an even more insane, higher level by Reign in Blood, but this album is also a perfect record, just in a different way.\n\nThe year is 1985, which has been a productive one for thrash metal. This is one of my four favorites that were released this year. This record, Bonded by Blood, Infernal Overkill, and Feel The Fire. By far, this is the darkest and most aggressive one out of these albums, but not just out of these albums, pretty much out of all of the thrash metal at the time. The record starts out with the infamous \"Hell Awaits\" that contains one of the greatest intro-speed-ups ever, rivaling even Destruction's Curse the Gods. The song is a very fast, Satanic, dark, evil dose of brutality, and the intensity of the music is instantly raised to a level that hasn't been done before. Do not think that this is the only song like this. The record keeps up, and while it slows down on occasions, the record always maintains its horrific, pure, raw evil form. \n\nThe band hasn't gone through any lineup changes, the golden squad is still the same. This is one of the most iconic appearances of one of the most iconic metal band lineups in HISTORY. Tom Araya's vicious vocals are perfectly executed, and his way of barking these words out of the mix makes it sound even more like the music itself was coming from hell. At times, it sounds like he is saying some sort of a satanic curse. His bass is actually very audible, which cannot be said about the predecessor, Show no Mercy, so big improvement there. Dave Lombardo's drumming is not nearly as insane as it became later on in the band's career, but you can definitely tell the huge improvement since the debut LP. His drumming is one of the best in the genre even at this point in time, let alone the next couple of records. \n\nLet's talk about the best guitar-duo in thrash metal history, Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. While they weren't the most consistent ones, they certainly created masterpieces that will never be rivaled by any guitar duo, and this is one of them. I have no idea what these guys' lives looked like, but they can write about suffering, evil, darkness better than anyone, and I don't mean the lyrics. I mean the riffs and the lead parts. These riffs create the appearance of hell in front of your eyes if you listen carefully. They have the intent to drag you below to hell, and they really do. They are absolutely masterfully written riffs placed in very intelligent song structures and well-calculated song lengths. They are colorful, not boring, very busy, manic riffs that as aforementioned, really do show you \"hell on Earth\". The leads are also extremely magnificent. Some people hate how they sound, and I get it because they expect to hear something melodic. Listen, this isn't meant to sound pretty. Hell is not pretty, and there is only one accurate way to make it appear, and this is how. \n\nThe production, of course, is extremely cutting edge, one of the best of all time. There is something just a little bit distant about the sound of the guitars, and it's very effective. Like everything, this also perfectly works with the theme. No complaints at all, even the bass is highly audible throughout the entire record, which is a pleasant surprise, particularly in Slayer's discography. \n\nIt seems like Slayer had one clear intent with this record. To show the listeners a very clear, accurate, harsh but real picture about hell, the suffering souls inside hell, and of course, the \"firey pits of hell\". With the production, the songwriting, the compositional devices, the lyrics, all of the elements of the record are working towards this common goal. Not a lot of records are this ambitious, but Slayer had the balls - and the talent. It has been an ultra-successful decision. The absolute masterpiece of songs that make up Hell Awaits deserve to be called legendary moments of thrash metal, with their darkness, evilness, viciousness, bloodthirstiness, and pitilessness. This is one of the absolute best moments of American thrash metal, and 80s metal in general, including everything.\n",
        "\nThroughout the nineties, numerous thrash metal veterans walked off the beaten path and experimented with different soundscapes leading to quite controversial results. Slayer opted to cover hardcore punk tracks on Undisputed Attitude which would turn out to be an excellent choice. The relentless energy of the original material isn't a far cry from Slayer's own pitiless thrash metal soundscapes.\n\nThe record starts without taking any prisoners as Verbal Abuse's ''Disintegration / Free Money'' is aggressive, fast and liberating without any experiments and lengths. However, Slayer manages to expand its soundscapes on this record without losing its relentless guiding line. D.I.'s ''Richard Hung Himself'' for instance comes around with a rather catchy and melodic chorus despite the grisly lyrics and energetic musicianship. Punk rock classic ''I'm Gonna Be Your Dog'' by The Stooges received a refreshing treatment with slightly modified lyrics and a faster exceution which blends in perfectly on this output.\n\nThis release includes two songs of Pap Smear, a short-lived punk side-project of Jeff Hannemann, Dave Lombardo and Rocky George from Suicidal Tendencies. These two tracks are clearly inspired by the groups covered on this output and blend in perfectly. It's great that Slayer is giving the side-project of two of its members some attention.\n\nThe album also includes a brand-new Slayer tune with ''Gemini'' which is something of a mixed bag. On one side, this is one of Slayer's greatest tracks with its gloomy oppressive atmosphere, slow and thunderous musicianship and unusually long running time of nearly five minutes. However, the track doesn't really blend in with the rest of the material on this album. It should have been released as a separate single or perhaps on a different studio album. Being tacked onto the end of a cover record doesn't do this underrated gem justice.\n\nAt the end of the day, American thrash metal veterans Slayer offer a half hour of power with relentless hardcore punk covers that take no prisoners. Hidden between relentless drum patterns, bumblebee bass guitar sounds, sharp riffs and raw vocals are occasionally melodic passages and catchy choruses that keep the record entertaining without watering it down. Despite its experimental approach, Undisputed Attitude can be considered an above average output in Slayer's discography. It's not a classic but should please fans of the band and anyone who likes hardcore punk music and brutal thrash metal.\n",
        "\nThis spot on the list was arguably the hardest one to settle on an album for. There\u2019s just so many excellent thrash releases that could\u2019ve ended up here. It could\u2019ve been Voivod\u2019s Killing Technology, Sodom\u2019s Code Red, or Vektor\u2019s Outer Isolation. Despite how many candidates there were for that position, all of which I consider great for a variety of reasons, I ended up settling with Slayer\u2019s fourth outing, South of Heaven, for reasons I\u2019ll explain below.\n\nIt is known that in the 80s Slayer was a force to be reckoned with in the thrash scene. At the time they were hot off the heels of Reign In Blood, which pushed the boundaries of extremity for thrash (there were actually more extreme bands but that\u2019s besides the point) and was one of the releases that caused them to skyrocket in popularity, thanks to fan favourites like \u201cAngel of Death\u201d and \u201cRaining Blood\u201d. South of Heaven though went on the exact opposite direction. Instead of going even faster they instead slowed down, and created what is arguably their most mature and well-developed album.\n\nSlayer\u2019s always been known to make a statement with their openings, and this album is no different. The title track sounds brooding and menacing, with its iconic opening, a stark contrast to the high-octane riffing of \u201cAngel of Death\u201d. It immediately sets the tone for the album and shows off the band\u2019s songwriting capabilities, all while still maintaining their distinct sound. Some of their absolute best material is on this album and it doesn\u2019t get talked about enough. The slower, more brooding tracks here manage to conjure an atmosphere that was sorely missing from their previous outing, without losing the energy Slayer is known for. It\u2019s still present, though in a more controlled and calculated manner, and it works like a charm. From the tension building of \u201cLive Undead\u201d, to the almost-doom closer, \u201cSpill the Blood\u201d, the slow tracks manage to make the biggest impression here. \n\nNow, while I am extremely fond of the slower moments on the record, it\u2019s by no means an indication that the guys had forgotten how to kick it into high gear. Tracks like \u201cSilent Scream\u201d and \u201cCleanse the Soul\u201d bring back the speed and aggression we all know and love, all while maintaining the ominous atmosphere of the slower moments on here. Said faster songs also manage to address one of my gripes with Reign in Blood, that being the fact that parts of the record blew by me without leaving much of an impression. Here these fast songs are actually developed and manage to make a statement in the grander context of the album. Even the solos sound good on this album, and let\u2019s be honest, most Slayer solos (or Kerry King\u2019s at least) are just really fast noise. But here the leads maintain their trademark sound while at the same time being memorable and better structured.\n\nThe lyrics are also a departure from the band\u2019s earlier output. As we all know by now, Slayer is known for writing about Satan, hell and murder most of the time, but here we see them transition into more sociopolitical themes. Here we get musings about decadence, war, abortion and manipulation, delivered yet again by Tom Araya. Here, in addition to his usual yells and screams, he also attempts singing, which while not great on a technical level, manages to add to the album\u2019s ominous atmosphere with how off it sounds.\n\nAs much as I love the album I\u2019ve precisely one nitpick to make, and that is on the mixing. While every other instrument can be heard clearly and with a very sharp sound (especially Lombardo\u2019s drums), Tom\u2019s bass playing is nigh on inaudible through most of the album, with a handful of exceptions. He\u2019s never been an extraordinary or adventurous bass player, but I consider the instrument to be a very important piece in any metal band\u2019s sound, and the production post-Hell Awaits has always left something to be desired. That being said it does sound good whenever it\u2019s audible, as do the rest of the instruments. It\u2019s just a shame that it doesn\u2019t have a more notable presence. Thankfully it\u2019s something one can easily look past due to the quality of the compositions on display, which more than make up for the lack of bass.\n\nSouth of Heaven is an album that shows a band maturing in a changing metal landscape, all while keeping their identity. It shows that you can grow and change without losing what made you who you are. It\u2019s arguably the best thing to come out of the \u201cslowthrash\u201d movement of the late 80s before the genre\u2019s death in the 90s and is arguably one of the best \u201ctransitional\u201d albums around, bridging 2 different aspects of Slayer\u2019s sound. It\u2019s one of the band\u2019s last \u201cclassic\u201d releases, before Seasons in the Abyss marked the end of an era, and it undoubtedly deserves more attention than what it ends up getting. Seriously guys, there are more tracks here than the title track and \u201cMandatory Suicide\u201d, and all of them are good, trust me.\n\nHighlights: South of Heaven, Silent Scream, Ghosts of War, Spill the Blood\n",
        "\nWhere to even begin with Slayer? I'm sure everyone here or who has even heard of the heavy metal genre is aware of these legends. They're part of the American big four of thrash metal alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. At their height, The four piece of Tom Araya, Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, and Dave Lombardo worked as a tight, cohesive unit to bring unrelenting extreme music flowing forth onto the metal masses. Their 80s output is legendary, influencing untold amounts of bands and genres at the time. Of this output, generally Reign in Blood is regarded as their peak. While a massively influential and great album in its own regard, I'm here to acknowledge what, in my opinion, is Slayer's magnum opus. Hell Awaits is a killer album that deserves even more recognition than it already receives.\n\nFor starters, the production on this album is perfect. The guitars are maliciously gritty and nasty, expanding upon the razor sharp sound of the band's previous album Show No Mercy. The bass is an evil audible pulse that resonates throughout the mix, making the album much heavier. The drums smash away with ferocity and might, completing the mix. Some people may dislike reverb on vocals, but for this album, it works very well. The mix on this album very much sounds like the band recorded it in the album cover itself (perhaps on the ledge where the Slayer logo is resting). And the musicality on this album is no slouch either. In my eyes, Hell Awaits is the earliest musical rumblings of the death metal genre. Whether its the time signature changes (influenced by Mercyful Fate), the chromatic and dissonant riffs and leads, the use of weird harmonies to emphasize certain parts of the songs, the bass-heavy production, or the vicious drumming (though no blasts), this album introduces many of the traits seen in early death metal. I would argue this album is more intense and death metal oriented than Possessed's Seven Churches, which came out the same year and is often considered the first death metal album. No offense to Jeff Becerra and the guys, but this album is so much heavier!\n\nThe songs themselves are also fantastic. From the anthemic title track to classics like \"At Dawn They Sleep\" and \"Necrophiliac\", there is no shortage of riffs or energy in this masterpiece. A lot of the songs have this breakneck and frantic tone to them that adds to the somewhat creepy atmosphere of this album. The only song on this album that falls flat is \"Hardening of the Arteries\". While the ending being a variation of the main riff of the title track is cool, the song itself is rather bland. I would've much preferred \"Altar of Sacrifice\" from Reign in Blood to have been on this album as it was intended to be and have the monolithic \"Crypts of Eternity\" be the closer to this album instead. Speaking of which, \"Crypts of Eternity\" might be my favorite Slayer song period. It typifies everything perfect about this album with its barbaric riffing and use of time signature changes. Plus Tom Araya's falsetto towards the end? Perfect. All around great material.\n\nIs there really any more that needs to be said about this record? It's a viciously heavy release with no shortage of riffs or energy. Much like their other early 80s output, this album helped to shape the rapidly expanding extreme metal sound of the mid 80s and influenced countless famous acts in both black and death metal as well as thrash metal. There is nothing more that needs to be said. An all time classic for sure. Find some way to listen to it if you for some reason haven't already!\n\nSelling Cuts: \"Crypts of Eternity\", \"Praise of Death\", \"At Dawn They Sleep\". Hard to pick just one.\n",
        "\nI'm going to be honest with you: There is no way for me to begin this review in any ordinary, clinical fashion, because this is Reign In Fucking Blood. The overwhelming majority of you already know what it is, what it sounds like, and why you all love or hate it. To describe specific elements of its sound in a vacuum is futile, because countless others have done so already in far greater detail than anything I can muster. This is more about the hows and whys of what it accomplished and the way it is perceived by new and old fans alike.\n\nThe things that its detractors commonly perceive as flaws (hardcore influences, short songs, little emphasis on memorability, e.t.c.) are simply a means to an end. The impact of this album is not owed merely to the things it has going for it, but rather to how it uses those things to accomplish something that has never been done before, and, to my knowledge, has not been successfully imitated since. You see, Reign In Blood is not a herald of death, Satan, abstract expressions, Nazi atrocities or even riff mastery, but pure, distilled ANGER. Though it's not outwardly visible, it's stunning just how many elements of its sound are ideal for expressing vitriol in maximum qualities and quantities. If Slayer's intent was to go against all established conventions and make a grand statement of \"FUCK YOU!\" that would make all fellow punks and thrashers quake in their boots, then mission accomplished. Without a doubt, I can call this the most contrarian metal album ever made - a fitting title considering the numerous contrarian opinions it has attracted due to the abrasive nature of its surface level elements.\n\nBefore I continue, I would like to highlight a little something that I will call \"spectacle\". \"Spectacle\", simply put, is anything that goes out of its way to stand out, to immediately catch your attention and express itself in a way that makes you drawn to those surface level elements. A catchy hook or melody that you will remember for days to come? That's spectacle. An elaborate build-up or epic song structure that aims to highlight its grandiosity in order to stand out? That's also spectacle. A dazzling display of technical skill? Spectacle. Even the carnal joy of DEM RIFFS that is arguably the main reason for our love of thrash is something that could also be called spectacle.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that while metal is something that normally lives and breathes spectacle, it's alarming that Reign In Blood, at least in its deeper cuts, actually relies on it very little. This is what I assume to be the reason why it's often misunderstood and lambasted by less experienced metal fans. Aside from the commonly excused \"Angel Of Death\" and \"Raining Blood\", the other songs don't have anything that immediately sticks out. This is why they they restrict their praises to those two tracks and why they say Hell Awaits is a better album - because those tracks are the ones that still largely rely on spectacle to get their point across. They're the ones that have badass thrash breaks, mosh riffs and screams of terror that are made to immediately impress, just the same as most conventional metal albums. Here, though, they are not the norm, but the exception. Spectacle is normally a very good thing, but Slayer's goal here is to express the fullest, most genuine anger that they possibly can. So, to achieve this, they choose to stick only to the bare minimum of spectacle, so as to focus fully on expressing vitriol.\n\nThis is fully evident in basically any songs on here that aren't the opening and closing track. Songs are structured similarly to a lot of hardcore punk and crossover thrash, with the anger being separated into short, intense bursts. Tempo changes are very few in number, and the few that are present serve mainly to enhance the flow of the songs while losing none of their anger. Riffs come and go while wasting the least amount of time possible. Solos are atonal and chaotic, signaling an absolute loss of emotional control, serving as the boiling point of Slayer's unholy hatred. Tom Araya's vocals and lyrics are the angriest, fastest and most shocking that they've ever been. Taking all of this into account, it's not unreasonable to look at Reign In Blood as a crossover thrash album, and in that case, it easily leaves all notable works in that style in the dust by virtue of excising everything save for the punk-fueled essence of anger, then turning up the musical and lyrical intensity to previously unheard levels. I know I'm restating what I just said here, but seriously, take any random Nuclear Assault or D.R.I. song you happen to be in love with. Now take \"Criminally Insane\". The way how one of these is the logical endpoint of another is nothing short of astounding, and even among the more extreme forms of metal I struggle to find anything that comes anywhere close to this level of HATE through pure musical expression.\n\nOf course, the production must also be mentioned, because someone (either their producer or sound engineer) must have realized exactly what they were going for. This dry, raw, reverbless sound that the album is so known for is a perfect fit for Slayer's intentions of pure, distilled violence. It specifically avoids adding any embellishments to what is already in place. It doesn't embrace our primal, barbaric instincts like \"Pleasure To Kill\". It doesn't aim to create a grandiose spectacle of evil riffing dominance like \"Darkness Descends\". It doesn't outwardly scream Sindel-style into your eardrums while dipping them in a pool of lava like Destruction's \"The Antichrist\". It just strips that anger down to its core, and makes it so that you're not meant to focus on the superficial qualities of the music, demanding to be treated more as this obscene, abstract, larger-than-life THING and less as a normal metal album.\n\nWhen rating the songs by how well they embody pure hatred, the highlights are actually among these middle tracks, because they are the best at focusing on violence while stripping away any distractions. MVP awards go to \"Altar Of Sacrifice\" and \"Criminally Insane\". These two songs get down to business immediately, while boasting riffs that somehow manage to achieve both absolute anger and absolute memorability without even relying on spectacle, topped off with Araya's most venomous vocal displays and lyrics that truly focus only on anger above all else. On the other hand, the more flawed tracks from this approach are actually the most \"normal\" ones - \"Angel Of Death\" and \"Raining Blood\". The music and lyrics on those tracks just doesn't share a common goal of embodying pure anger with the rest of the tracks. The music and lyrics are still focused mostly on sticking in your head and making an impression. Still great songs, but they could've benefited from being more balls-to-the-wall FURIOUS while stripping any sense of grandeur that they actually have.\n\nI also have to single out \"Epidemic\" for... not really being any of those things I just listed. When compared to any other tracks here, it's not all that fast, violent, or even catchy, and I'm inclined to call this the weakest track on the album. However, because of this, it momentarily returns you back to reality, and at the perfect moment, unleashes a thrash break that honestly obliterates \"Angel Of Death\", a brief precious few seconds of ear candy and headbanging - one brief moment of relative sanity before the assault resumes. This is yet another testament to just how much effort and focus went into making so many parts of this album embody anger in such an effective way. Even the weakest part of the album still fulfills a purpose, and is crucial to the album's pacing, meaning that the album wouldn't be complete without it. \n\nTo conclude, I would like to give a tip to basically anyone who wrote a negative review of this album. To those of you who find it to be an unmemorable mess: you're listening to the wrong album. You're treating this like a normal thrash album, expecting to find hooks and riffs and melodies at every corner. Don't treat this like a normal thrash album - there's already plenty of those worth hearing, including at least four from the same gentlemen that gave you THIS. Treat this like Reign In Fucking Blood - an inimitatable, unmatched expression not of brutality, not of superficial elements like riffs, but of pure sonic malice. I was once like you, unable to comprehend just what people love about it, but I wrote this after I looked at it differently. You see that number at the top? That's a rough representation of how much I enjoy it, and for all of the things it doesn't quite get right, this is still the lowest I can possibly rate it in good conscience. It's fucking great, because it did what no one else dared to do, and it did it well. Thank you for reading.\n",
        "\nI'm giving a review of the sound coming out of my stereo with the 2013 US bi-colored vinyl reissue, which I'm pretty sure is secretly remastered, it doesn't sound like the original, the mastering has been tinkered with slightly just enough. I thought one should keep this in mind.\n\nThis album seems to suffer from \"Divine Intervention\" syndrome, as in 50% of Slayer fans love it and the other hate it for what seems strange and inexplicable reasons.\n\nI was attracted to the extreme creepiness of the title track, the funeral doom type intro to it still being perfectly chilling. Plus it's middle part is a mix of Angel of Death's and Fictional Reality with the metal ring on the finger noise bridge. I never had a problem with the mix, but if you do, get to hear the album on vinyl, and one of the reissues, the ones with a catalogue number like this B0018857-01, starting with B are secretly remastered, they're from 2013 and 2014 reissues, they sound better than the original. Now with production aside.\n\nNot Of This God might have one of the best thrash breakdown and explosion in speed with solo. I love its death metallish main guitar riff, the short blast beat at the end when Tom yells \"NOT OF THIS....NOT OF THIS GOOOOODDD!!!!\" is deliciously blasphemous. Really the only songs I think are average in quality are Public Display of Dismemberment (despite the blastbeats and mad drumming in general) and Playing With Dolls, which works but is the weakest of their slow creepy doomy songs out there. Another highlight is the soloing in Hate Worldwide, despite the weak lyrics, it works because it's so beautifully intense, their soloing is at levels it hadn't been since Seasons/Divine on here generally, but even the surprising changes in riffs under the solo, which leads, literally where the song goes next, is part of the thrash pantheon of riffs/solos.\n\nI think the overhype about Lombardo during that era might be what caused this kind of review to exist. I'll agree that the fast riff in the title track is a bit easy to play (aka lazy), but it works. Americon doesn't bother me at all, the punky riff and the double bass are killer and again when the soloing comes in..\n\nBut the eargasm for me here is Snuff and Beauty Through Order, the latter being so full of tempo changes, it is exciting to hear what comes next at first listen. Tom using his singing voice similar as in SoH and SitA works well considering he's singing from the perspective of the most evil medieval Queen of all time. And that sweet circle pit summoning preceded by the creepy riff exchange when Tom goes \"heated iron bar I'll insert inside your cunt, princess of cruelty...\". I only wish it wasn't placed right after Snuff because they have similar endings (explosive with a repeating line getting more intense at every utterance.\n\nThat album determined late 2009 and the \"fears\" in the air there were from H1N1 (laughable then to me, laughable later, only know one person who bothered getting the shot for that), most ended up in the medical waste disposal furnace...but the doomy drone of Human Strain works for me, as I expect just what the lyrics describe in the song too, adding more serious feels to the song, the new coronavirus is coming from the Pacific Ocean (I could go on about that but it's not the place nor the time...I just woke up).\n",
        "\nAll right, no jokes here, only my honest opinion. I've always had problem with Slayer. I can count up a lot of thrash metal bands which work is more consistent and way more engaging than the mindless whiplash this particular quartet is known for. I think bands like Dark Angel, Kreator, Overkill and Onslaught are much better when it comes to subject of relentless speed. However, they also remember to incorporate actual melody into the mix, making the speed actually mean something. Well, Slayer too understand the idea of melody, as seen with basically any other classic album, which mix their trademark aggression with melodic interludes. Which is why I don't understand why 'Reign in Blood' seem to disregard all of this.\n\nI should start with positives first. 'Angel of Death' became one of the best Slayer's songs, and for good reasons. While it's beginning and ending are pretty damn fast, it's the middle section that makes this song so engaging. Listening to it every time I can't wait to hear the riff that begins the bridge. And Dave Lombardo is shining here, not only because of insane double pedaling, but also due to him setting the proper groove for this slowdown. The only downside are the solos. Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King were never great guitarist, and while their riffs can be strong, their soloing is, from here on out, very forced and shallow. Jeff sometime managed to came up with something more interesting, like in 'Dead Skin Mask', or 'Seasons in the Abyss' (the song), but Kerry seems to never improve over his very basic skills. You could probably tell his solos if you isolated his tracks, but you could never tell from which song it is. You could probably do that for Hanneman's leads, but King just sticks to the same pattern of playing random notes without any thought behind it. It's just annoying.\n\nTwo other highlights are, no suprise, 'Postmortem' and 'Raining Blood'. 'Postmortem' in its entirety is a build-up to the final song, and I love how it progressively gets faster and faster, until the explosion of energy in its last 40 seconds, which later turns into introduction of 'Raining Blood'. The finale itself has an iconic riff and is solid overall. It builds up the atmosphere to the classic double-bass mayhem, but it also slow down again and makes another buildup for another fast section. That's cool, I wonder where they go next... Wait, it ends already? They didn't even evolved the solos past some random noises and they just cut it and put some rain effect? Really? It's like they had a great idea for an epic 6/7 minute thrasher, but after 3 minutes they run out of ideas and maybe they had no time to finish the album. Judging by other songs, I wouldn't be suprised if that was the case.\n\nAnd let that serve as a metaphor for the rest of this album. All the three songs are great, because they take their time to build-up to the rampage. However, everything else doesn't hold a candle to those three songs. The likes of 'Necrophobic' and 'Altar of Sacrifice' are like those overhyped kids that can't sit in their place for 5 minutes and have to start the rampage straight away. And because they only last for 2 minutes or less, you won't remember anything after listening to them. I mean, somehow I can still remember the chorus for 'Pride in Prejudice' and I haven't heard that song in 3 years or so, but I can't recall anything from 'Necrophobic' even though I just finished this album. At least 'Altar' has a memorable beginning riff. Meanwhile 'Reborn' and 'Epidemic' has nothing interesting about them. It also doesn't help when the drumming in each of those song just sound the same.\n\nTwo songs seem to actually has something going for them. 'Jesus Saves' and 'Criminally Insane' are a bit more complex than the usual RiB whiplash. But... it doesn't work well. 'Jesus Saves' ends up being underwhelming, because the second part of the song has basically nothing to do with its first part. It's a slow build-up towards a fast hitting song, but the riffs from beginning never come back again. Once it enters full force - it just stays in it. 'Criminally Insane' has a great intro and it's probably the closest to be a finished song. It definitely needed some polish and more delevopment, probably closer to what 'Beauty Through Order' is, just, you know... without being lame like its younger brother.\n\nI seriously have hard time following how this underdeveloped piece of music became such a classic, a 'masterpiece' even. Yeah, it's definitely the fastest music of 1986. Unless you've heard Dark Angel. Honestly, aside from drumming (cause Hoglan and Lombardo are equally badass), 'Darkness Descends' is what 'Reign in Blood' should be. Sure, it's also kind of fast and mindless at times, but Dark Angel at least took its time to make a build-up to this rampage. Either 'Darkness Descends' (the song) or most recognizable 'Merciless Death' don't just start up fast. And when some song start up fast, like 'Burning of Sodom' they have some great riffing to back it up. Something I can't say about shit like 'Necrophobic' or 'Jesus Saves'.\n\nAnd it sucks, because there IS a lot of potential in those songs. But they often tend to just end abruptly, leaving listener with feeling \"The hell was that one about?\". If you want to \"get\" into Slayer's music, then yeah, it's important to know it. But not for the reasons fanboys want you to believe. This should've been either polished with a package of new riffs, or just released as an EP with 'Angel', 'Postmortem', 'Raining' and 'Criminally'. It would work much better, and then I could actually understand high ratings it received.\n\nEDIT:\nSomething came to mind recently, regarding this record as I was listening to Exodus' 'Bonded by Blood'. Probably the best metaphor for this album would be the same way modern Mortal Kombat treats violence. As a shallow spectacle, to appear \"cool\" and \"extreme\" - \"LOL, this guy shreds the other's guy skin off!\". Remember the times when Liu Kang as a shaolin monk used to not have brutal fatalities 'cause it was against his code? And it was a suprisingly well defined concept to convey his personality. Well, people thought it was lame and now this SHAOLIN MONK is as bloodthirsty as everyone else. Same goes for this album, all this speed is just a shallow spectacle that only proves how fast Slayer can play, but also dumbs down the songs to simple \"220 bpm\" gimmick, appealing only to people that think thrash should only be fast and aggressive.\n\nThe more I think about 'Reign in Blood', the more reasons I find to dislike this. It's not even \"most aggressive album ever\" if you've heard more than 5 bands in your life and chances were one of them was Exodus and their 'Bonded by Blood' released in 1985. That one reeks of pure violence, hatred and aggression, while being packed with actually great songs. Why would anyone wanted to listen to 'Altar of Sacrifice', 'Reborn' or 'Jesus Saves' over 'A Lesson in Violence' is beyond me. Even it's production is much better. Less overproduced at least, that's for sure. Previous Slayer's album was also primitive, violent, but also dark, eerie. 'Hell Awaits' sucks you in with its hellish atmosphere. Meanwhile, 'Reign in Blood' lacks even that - any sort of atmosphere, that would make me want to think about coming back to this album.\n\nA good advice - you want a mindless rampage in form of music? Look up any grindcore band. And keep that shit away from thrash.\n",
        "\nSlayer has been a favorite band for hundreds and thousands, if not tens of millions of people worldwide. There is a great reason for that, no band in the history of metal has been able to capture the suffering of the human soul, the torturous pain that it goes through during difficult stages of life. However, when you read that previous sentence, you do not think \"Oh, yes, I agree. Show No Mercy does just that.\". You think Hell Awaits, Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, perhaps Seasons in the Abyss do that, if you are a die-hard Slayer fan, like me. If to you, Slayer is just \"another\" band that you like, you may be only thinking Reign in Blood. This record, in terms of style and sounding, is completely disconnected from Slayer's later discography, but it is not a problem at all. It is a different type of Slayer that is just as memorable and amazing as the later, hatred-based Slayer.\n\nThe band with this album started out playing speed metal with some occasional thrash metal-like elements. Back in 1983, the style was not yet completely defined. It's highly controversial who \"created\" the genre, so it's not worth talking about it, because there really is no right or wrong answer. Nobody \"created\" any genre, they all evolved. If you are aware of the origins of the genre, you can not deny (unless you are stupid) that this album played a major role in the evolvement of thrash metal music. The signs of thrash metal, the fast pace, the destructive riffing, the continuously crushing, loud hi-hat, the barking vocals appeared on this record, for one of the first times in the history of music. \n\nHaving the importance and significance of the record out of the way, let's talk about the musicianship. The first actual, LP-appearance of the legendary quartet, Tom Araya, Jeff Hanneman, Kerry King, and Dave Lombardo. The guitar work, if you look at it from a reasonable, objective point of view, is the best guitar work in all of Slayer's history. The riffs are the most sophisticated and most melodic out of all of Slayer's records. Some of the catchiest Slayer songs can be found on this record, including but not limited to \"Fight Till Death\", \"Black Magic\", \"Tormentor\". The riffs are very well thought out, well-articulated and they work magnificently with the theme and atmosphere of the record. Oh, and let's not forget the lead work. Here, the two guys actually put some real meaning, some sense behind those solos. Listen to the solos of \"Tormentor\", and/or \"The Final Command\". They are actually really well-written, advanced solos. \n\nBesides the excellent, melodic, clever guitar work, the rest of the band is not bad either. Dave Lombardo was an outstanding drummer even back in this time. Though the style of the music did not allow him to go above and beyond what was expected like later (insane filling and brutal double-bass sections with some ultra-high BPM just don't go well with melodic speed metal, not that I know of) you can tell that he really knew what he was doing. His understanding of what would and would not work when the riffs change, and when the tempo changes is very high. Tom Araya's bass is very audible, which is one sentence you will not often read. Besides his well-fitting bass lines, his vocals are excellent as well. It is true that his vocals have been the same for decades, but I freaking love his vocals, so to me, it is no problem. Everyone on the record is putting on a show. \n\nThe lyrics don't really need to be mentioned, because there is not a lot of meaning behind them. Darkness, evil, Satan, blah blah blah. Lyrics are really not the reason why this record is amazing. The production to me is perfectly acceptable, moreover, very good for the year it was released in. The audio quality is perfect. Each instrument is perfectly balanced, along with the vocals. \n\nLet's conclude this masterpiece. Is this album the most virtuoso, most technically advanced thrash metal record of all time? Not by a damn long shot. Is this the fastest? No. Is it the one with the most meaningful, deepest message? Absolutely not. Then why the hell does it get 100%!? Because it is FUN! The catchiness, the melodies, the badass riffs, the beautiful solos, the \"cool\", not yet frightening appearance of evil, everything creates a picture that I just love. I put this album on, and I'll start to headbang along in 5 seconds, all the way until the end. I keep coming back to this record from time to time to listen to it again, and it only gets better with every listen. I know every move by now, but it just never gets old. It is a dose of true, honest, authentic (it really doesn't get more OG than this), original metal, that will never be surpassed.\n",
        "\nMetallica, Slayer, Megadeth & Anthrax, the Big Four of Thrash Metal!... Ha, good one. That's the funniest shit I've seen since seeing Kong shoving a tree down Godzilla's throat (or an axe, if you've seen their latest rematch). Honestly, as of right now, only Megadeth seems to still fit the part of this whole \"idea\", as Slayer doesn't exist anymore, Metallica only scratches the surface of thrash and so does Anthrax. But hey, they apparently sell the biggest number of records, unlike other bands being much closer to thrash, like Death Angel, Overkill, Testament or Exodus, so it makes sense, I guess...? Whatever this marketing crap is, the idea of this four bands uniting for making a tour around the world was born. And it ended up in recording this DVD, which I manage to bought some long time ago. However, I feel like I could spent that money on buying an actual good DVD, if other bands like Overkill or Death Angel were more open to the idea of fucking doing them.\n\nChronologically, I should start with Anthrax, but I prefer to start from Slayer. \"Fucking Slayer\" (or \"SLAYER, kurwa!\" from where I come from), I always cringe when I hear that chant. It makes me feel like those people have no idea that thrash needs more than aggression and speed to be great. While it could seem like I hate Slayer - no, not really. When they actually put some effort, they really can produce some relatively good music, as shown with 'Show No Mercy', 'Hell Awaits' (which are two albums completely overlooked on this show - what are the odds!), 'South of Heaven', 'Seasons in the Abyss' and even 'God Hates Us All'. It's mostly the cult following of 'Reign in Blood' that really gets under my nerves, because this album only has hollow aggression and speed to offer. And nothing else. But that didin't stopped metalheads from calling it \"magnum opus\" of thrash and compare every competent album to this mediocrity. But that's a story for another time.\n\nHonestly, this show is really weak. Not only the setlist sucks, offering very little variety out of Slayer's entire catalogue (it's mostly the big hits from 'Reing In Blood', 'South of Heaven' and 'Seasons in the Abyss', with three song from then-latest release 'World Painted Blood', 'Disciple' from 'God Hates Us All' and 'Jihad' from 'Christ Illusion'), but the song performances are also lacking punch. Hannemann and King were never anything special, but now they've really set the bar to the new low. Solos feel sloppy, as if playing those songs thousand times wasn't enough. I guess it's a nice thing to see Slayer in the iconic OG line-up before Jeff passed away, but to be honest, these guys are/were past their prime. Well, most of them, because Dave Lombardo is Dave Lombardo and Dave Lombardo is fucking awesome. Even if Slayer's music doesn't give him much of a room to vary his playstyle. Arguably, the lowest point of this show is Tom Araya. His vocals are just a pain to listen to. At some moments he sound like he's struggling for breath. Maybe he should have taken some vocal lessons to learn how to utilize your energy during singing better. Hell, maybe that would let him do the proper high-pitched screams again. \n\nAnother problem is the sound, which is quite muddy. While on 'Vile' by Cannibal Corpse it works for album's atmosphere, here it's just annoying. Live perfomances for me should sound clean enough to hear every member doing their work. Only drums sounds a bit passable, while King's guitar seem to overpower Hannemann's guitar in the mix, and Tom Araya seems to be completely lost, both vocally and with bass guitar. For better or worse, it's perhaps a good thing Slayer ended their career. Araya seems happy with retirement, King can play his horrible solos elsewhere (which I pity to whoever decides to join his new pet project) and Lombardo provides his skills for Suicidal Tendencies and Philm. Overall, I rate it around 35%. Too much bullshit for me to recommend. 'Decade of Aggression' is much likely a better choice.\n\nNext in the list, Anthrax. And again, it's pretty \"meh\". The musicianship is much tighter than Slayer, though. And as long as Charlie Benante isn't allowed anywhere close to 'Fast as a Shark' by Accept, I'll take him. But there are two things dragging this show down. First, setlist. I'll just gonna ask, where is 'Among the Living' (the song)? Where's 'A.I.R.'? Or 'Gung-Ho'? Or anything from 'Persistence of Time'? You had the time to play a song from much rather despised John Bush era, but nothing from 5th album? Not even a cheesy 'Belly of the Beast'? I guess that Joe Jackson cover of 'Got the Time' is the representative of 'Persistence of Time', but I'll rather have an original song here.\n\nBut even with better setlist the show would still be disappointing, because Joey Belladonna can't sing to save his life anymore. While the band seem to have a lot of fun performing the songs, Belladona drags the entire show down. In the 80s he may seemed a little bit like Bruce Dickinson knock-off, here it's even more evident, since his vocals downgraded just as much as Bruce's. It's again painful to listen, especially during 'Heaven and Hell' cover. Sorry Joey, but Mark Osegueda is the only one who can fucking nail this song. And again, Belladonna is struggling to keep his breath during singing a lot of times. And people have balls to say they're the best of out the 4. Yeah, fuck no.\n\nOne advantage they have over the rest is sound, which is clean, and sleak, and exactly how a modern live show should fucking sound like! It's right there with first part of 'The World is Ours' by Motorhead, 'Dark Roots of Thrash' by Testament or both Metallica's DVD from year prior. The drums have enough punch in them, the bass is audible, and guitars are just perfect. The only complaint is Belladona's voice being a bit hidden in the mix, although that might be a good thing... Overall, 50%. The musicianship and sound can't save a show with this disgraceful vocal performance. And to think I used to say this show was the best. What a joke. Get yourselves a copy of 'Alive 2', it's a much better Anthrax expierience with Belladonna that doesn't sound like a watered down version of modern Bruce Dickinson. Who already is a watered down version of classic Bruce, which is... Yikes.\n\nOkay then, Metallica. The biggest out of 4, the most recongizable, and of course have to put out the biggest and longest show. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Problem one, the setlist became way too formulaic at the time. We start with 'Creeping Death', so of course it only makes sense to follow-up with 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', correct that with 'Fuel' and a forgotten gem from 'Ride the Lightning' or '...And Justice for All', a ballad (at least 'One' appears much later on), a 'Death Magnetic' song (it's not 'Broken, Beat & Scarred', thank God), followed up by 'Cyanide', 'Sad But True', another ballad, 'All Nightmare Long', ANOTHER BALLAD, 'Master of Puppets', thrashy song with intro (and it's not overlooked 'Fight Fire With Fire' or 'Battery'), duo 'Nothing Else Matters' and 'Enter Sandman', cover song, and two 'Kill 'Em All' songs, the second one being obligatory 'Seek and Destroy'.\n\nI mean, at this point Metallica released 2 official albums which have this setlist structure, and countless of bootlegs from other shows. How hard it was to do some fucking changes? It wasn't until 2014/2015 when they're finally shaken the formula up, but seeing almost exact same-y setlist for 3rd time, with few song appearing on the THIRD RELEASE IN A ROW, makes me absolutely LIVID, to put it mildly. Like, why should I buy this release over, let's say, 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' or 'Francais Pour Une Nuit'? Because without it, I'm only losing Big Four's joined performance of 'Am I Evil' (and aside from Lombardo, Slayer didn't even bother to show up, so fuck'em) and other three concerts, but aside from Megadeth, I wouldn't cry over losing them. And right now, I'm kind sick to death of hearing 'Blackened' or 'Cyanide', and don't even get me started on fucking 'One'. Why not give 'My Apocalypse' or 'The Shortest Straw' some exposure? Yeah, I know they're on 'Quebec Magnetic'. But before 2012, QM was nowhere near close release, so again, what does Metallica fan gains by buying this release?\n\nProblem two, perfomances. I know it's cheap to make fun of Lars' poor drumming skills and Kirk's excessive attachment to wah pedal, but it's just too easy. Apparently, they did improve in the last few years on 'Hardwired' tours, but it's all too little, too late. And Kirk is still unable to play one solo without his livesafer. Something that was charming in the 80s, is now pathetic. Thankfully, Rob and James are league above the other half of the Metallica. I mean, Rob comes from Infectious Groove, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Label Society and played for Ozzy fucking Osbourne, so what else is there to say? Metallica always had a nose for great bassists, and Rob is no different (even if Burton's creative inputs and Newsted devilish backing vocals will always be missed). James was always a tight rhythm guitarist, sometimes even providing some great solos ('Master of Puppets' and 'Nothing Else Matters' being most prominent examples) and while his voice is rather a huge downgrade from 80s, he's nowhere near as bad as Araya or Belladonna. And he's without a doubt a great frontman, encouraging audience to sing with him, giving some peptalks and stuff.\n\nProblem three, sound. While I can compliment 'Orgullo, Pasion y Gloria' and 'Francais Pour Une Nuit' for their clean and sleak sound, this one however starts to show some cracks. The drums feel like they're trying to remind the 'And Justice for All' era, to which I say: \"STOP!\", while the bass seem to trying to find its place in the mix. That might be only complaints about the sound, cause guitars and vocals are good enough. And of course, the 'Am I Evil' with other bands is a highlight for a lot of people, but my would rather be 'All Nightmare Long' - hearing this song live every time feels great, and even with those performers this song's atmosphere is more than enough to make it worth a listen. My rating for this show is somewhere around 65%, 70% at most. I'm getting sick of hearing 'Blackened', 'One' and 'Cyanide' on each of the DVD they've released. And Lars and Kirk should really start to suck it up and practicing a lot, because if it wasn't for James and Rob, they would probably be thrown out of the band long time ago.\n\nI decided to save the best for the last, i.e. Megadeth. Hell yes, that's one show that I can't complain about much. Or rather, I'd need to resort to nitpicking to actually find flaws. Setlist is great for a show that lasts only 1 hour (although 'Holy Wars' being played twice is questionable for me), the musicianship is top notch, and the sound is great. Well, okay, now for complaints, number 1, lack of Dave's interaction with crowd. I know he's not as great of a vocalist, but as a charismatic persona, he should interact with audience more. Here he only says couple of words before 'Head Crusher' and that's it. Live performances have this advantage of interacting with the crowd, yet Mustaine didn't decided to use that. Shame, cause this show, while being fantastic, definitely needs to catch a breath. Number 2, while drums and bass sound fucking perfect ('Hook in a Mouth' opening proves that), the guitars feel muddled, and sound like they've caught a stage fright...? Although it's probably due to rain during the perfomance, and some nasty weather is not enough to spook out Megadeth, so I can forgive that. Aside from that, though, I have no complaints. 90% from me. Funnily enough, I considered the show to be the weakest out of entire 4 back in the day I bought this DVD. How the turns have tabled indeed...\n\nHonestly, 'The Big Four: Live from Sofia, Bulgaria' is rather a disappointing release. 1 show is a complete disaster, other two are hampered by certain musicians, and only one actually delievers on what fans want. This is really far from what, in comparison, Testament or Motorhead can offer in terms of live perfomance, and it's definitely inferior to all of those bands' previous live recordings, 'Decade of Aggresion' and 'Live Shit' especially. I would just recommend to check out those bands' other DVDs, because it's really not worth it just for the sake of Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Dave Lombardo performing 'Am I Evil'. Well, that, and the fact that these bands aren't really the 'Big Four of Thrash'.\n",
        "\nThe 90s was kinda an odd time for Slayer. The band had released \"Seasons in the Abyss\" back in 1990, and it was a good release, but for many fans it kinda felt off. Yes, it still had some great thrashy riffs, but this was the start of a time where Slayer begun to experiment with different sounds. It would start back in 1988 with \"South of Heaven\" going for a slower tempo, but would go into full force two years later with SITA, and would come to a crashing halt in 2001 with \"God Hates Us All\" incorporating some nu metal parts. \"Divine Intervention\" did felt more like the black sheep out of this era, however, with it coming out in between SITA and Undisputed Attitude's crossover thrash style. While it may not be Slayer's greatest album, it still is a great album.\n\nOne thing that makes \"Divine Intervention\" different from other albums would be the instruments. DI still has plenty of thrash elements, but since this album came out in the wake of Kurt Cobain's death and the death of grunge in general, the band decided to add in some grunge elements. To see what I mean, take the first track \"Killing Fields\" for example. This album goes for a slower tempo similar to SOH, but it also has some of the dirty production of grunge. The guitars in particular play some diverse riffs ranging from thrash metal-like riffs to some more sloppier grunge-like riffs. The drums also follow along the guitars very well, as it not only sets the standard for the tempo, but it also beats in some technical patterns that enforce the tone well. The album does go for some other styles, like the pure thrash sound of \"Sex. Murder. Art.\" or the Nirvana-inspired intro of \"213\". While most of the instrumentals are great, I do like the tracks that mix in thrash and grunge the most, since it does show that these two genres can mix well if given the right execution.\n\nAnother drastic change from the previous albums is the vocals. Tom Araya's vocals are famous for the screaming and the utter mad personality of them, but Tom takes a different approach in them for \"Divine Intervention\". For a lot of tracks, he drags his vocals a bit and goes for a lot more chants. A great example of this would be in the track \"Serenity in Murder\". There, Araya sings half of the track and screams in the other half. The singing flows well to the more technical riffs and the screams execute the more insane atmosphere well. In some tracks like \"Fictional Reality\" and \"Divine Intervention\", Tom takes some more inspiration from grunge artists and slurs his vocals a bit. While it may sound unfitting on paper, the slower tempo and melodic-sounding guitars fit well to these vocals. They do have some weak moments, but overall, Tom's vocals are unique and stand out from their more abrasive releases.\n\nOne area that does need a bit of work though would be in the lyrical department. Slayer is known for having some dark and scary lyrics, but the lyrics here feel a bit neutered. For example, in the track \"Dittohead\", this verse quotes:\n\nThis fucking country's lost its grip\nSubconscious hold begins to slip\nThe scales of justice tend to tip\n\nTom screams about the country going downhill in the justice department. The track goes for an aggressive thrash style, and the screaming vocals should enhance the lyrics, but they don't. The lyrics aren't bad, but they feel a bit broad and don't exactly reflect the violence in the instruments. While the themes of the lyrics and instruments feel out of place, there are times where they do work with each other. Going back to \"Serenity in Murder\", the lyrics of murder reflect well with Tom's singing and screams and gives the context of the murder a more sinister tone. While the lyrics don't always work well with the instruments, they are still written good and can sometimes work with the instruments.\n\nSo with that said, \"Divine Intervention\" is one of the stronger records during Slayer's experimental period. The grunge influence on many of the tracks mix well with the thrash elements, and Tom's versatile vocals sound great and mirror the instruments a lot. This album may be one of the weaker ones in Slayer's discography, but for what it is, it's a really good album. I recommend it if you're looking for some thrash metal with some grunge influence.\n",
        "\nIt's the year 1985. Slayer has already released their debut album \"Show No Mercy\" and their EP \"Haunting the Chapel\", but they were just a year short of releasing their magnum opus \"Reign in Blood\". So what will the band do until then? Simple: Go in the studio and record a second album called \"Hell Awaits\". At first, it sounds like the band is going to be making a filler album as a way to keep the fans distracted while they craft \"Angel of Death\", but upon listening to it, you'll find that it's anything but. Not only does it have some killer instruments and epic vocals, but it remains the best album Slayer has ever done.\n\nThe first notable thing about this album is the instruments. Slayer is well known for having some iconic instrumentals, but \"Hell Awaits\" has some of the best instrumental works in their discography. The guitar riffs are even more powerful than the previous releases at the time, as they have a more darker and distorted sound. The drums also beat in more technical patterns, so when it's not beating fast and aggressive, it beats in more groovy and ritualistic patterns. Even the bass is unique, as it has a deeper sound and builds the foundation of the tracks well. All of these instruments are combined to bring in a hellish atmosphere, and this album still has some of the darkest atmospheres in Slayer's discography. Some of the best instruments from this album are from the tracks \"Hell Awaits\", \"At Dawn They Sleep\", and \"Necrophiliac\". The first track in particular remains one of the best intros in a Slayer album, as its haunting vocals in the intro and the aggressive guitar riffs and beating drums provide an atmosphere of pure chaos. Each track has its own specialty that makes the instrumentals sound awesome, and they connect together to form a dark atmosphere.\n\nAnother excellent part of the album is the vocals. Tom Araya's vocals in the previous releases were great, but he steps up his game in \"Hell Awaits\". His voice has more power and might in them, and he shouts at a faster pace. One of the better vocal moments is in the first track \"Hell Awaits\", where Araya screams out the lyrics extremely fast. This makes his anger feel genuine, and is fitting for the extreme instruments and atmosphere. Another excellent vocal moment is in the track \"Praise of Death\", where Tom is chanting the lyrics. The vocals on this track feel more powerful than in most other tracks, and enhance the atmosphere in giving it a more strong and grand feel. Tom Araya's vocals on this album are overall amazing, and they further execute the album's hostile tone.\n\nEven the lyrics on this album are well above average. Take the lyrics to \"Crypts of Eternity\" for example, where this verse quotes:\n\nI have seen the darkened depths of Hell\nSorcery beyond the witches' spell\nRobbed the crypts of death's eternity\nKilled the priest and cursed him endlessly\n\nTom recalls his experience in hell by explaining how the spells from a witch cursed a priest. The way the lines are worded make the curses feel brutal and graphic, and these lyrics are further executed by Tom's chanting and the more complex structure the track goes for. Another excellent lyrical moment on this album is \"Necrophiliac\", where the lyrics are about a necrophile raping a bunch of corpses. The lyrics themselves are a bit basic, but the furious atmosphere of the track make the actions of the necrophile feel more savage and wicked. The lyrics are very descriptive and poetic, and their execution on the tracks are perfect.\n\nWith all of these reasons, it's easy to see why many consider \"Hell Awaits\" as one of their greatest works. The instrumentals are excellent, the vocals are unique and amazing, and the lyrics are some of the best Slayer has to offer. \"Reign in Blood\" would come out the next year and take Slayer to a whole new level, and while I like RIB, it just doesn't have the same power as \"Hell Awaits\". This album is amazing overall, and it is recommended to anyone who enjoys more hellish themes.\n",
        "\nMany say that Slayer's fall started when they released their God Hates us All album others say that their true fall was when they released this album and I believe that their true fall started when they released the album made before this one (Undisputed Attitude). I do believe that this album is one of their worst albums (it's so bad that it is down there with God Hates us All and Undisputed Attitude). The music is very different from Slayer's old albums (Show no Mercy, Hell Awaits, Regin in Blood, South of Heaven, and Seasons in the Abyss).\n\nThe first major difference is with the vocals (who are done by the legendary singer Tom Araya). Even though, he is singing it is very different from how he usually sings. This why many people (who love Slayer's older albums) don't like this album. A notable change is that Araya is not singing in his usual high pitch (for people who do not know what I am talking about he is not screaming at the mike). He is also not singing with his rage. This is why many Slayer fans do not like this album because they want Araya to sing in his raging, high-pitch voice. \n\nThe next notable change in this album comparing it to their older albums is that the drums are not played by Dave Lombardo (who left the band after Slayer's final great album Seasons in the Abyss) and is as good at playing the drums as Araya is good at singing. The person who played the drums in Diabolus in Musica the drums is Paul Bostaph (who is a great drummer but is no Lombardo) and this isn't his first time playing with Slayer. He played two albums with Slayer before this one (Divine Intervention, and Undisputed Attitude), and will play two more albums with Slayer after this one (these albums are God Hates us All, and their last album to be made by the band Repentless).\n\nThe final main reason why this album was hated by so many people is that Slayer attempted to make a nu-metal album (if you don't know what that is it's just metal that's just blended into some other music genre like jazz or hip-hop) which was very popular in the metal community in the mid to late 90s. Since this album was released during the late 90s (when nu-metal was at its peak) it can be concluded that Slayer was trend hoping. Hell, even Kerry King (Slayer's guitarist and main songwriter) says that this album is a mistake and that they were trend hopping.\n\nIn conclusion, this album was just like Undisputed Attitude except for it was much slower and softer than it. Even though, I do think that some nu-metal fans may enjoy this I highly doubt that they would Slayer fans in the first place. So with the combination of trend hopping, a much slower pace, not as heavy, and with Araya testing out new vocals instead of just sticking with what he knew would work it is no wonder why this song is so hated by Slayer fans.\n",
        "\nShow No Mercy has a lot of things going for it--the songs are well written, well rehearsed, and considering the previous Slayer material it's clear that the band had a strong ethos of quality over quantity and what kind of songs needed to be written. It's situated perfectly between the plethora of heavy metal and hard rock influences to pull from and right on the cusp of the extreme metal blowout that Slayer would have a massive hand in bringing up. In addition, it's got enough speed to that even though it's retroactive we may finally use the descriptor \"speed metal\" to describe the metal contained within. For the occultic, Satanic freaks--it's finally the heavy metal album that actually FEELS like Satan worship this side of Venom. You thought Link Wray and Little Richard were selling Satan to children, Mr. Preacher?...it's time to face the Slayer.\n\nOne hallmark of a famed heavy metal album--and one as powerful as Show No Mercy--is that when brought up in crowds, and asked what the favorite song is, there's a plethora of answers. Some people prefer the gang-shouted ritual worship of \"Evil Has No Boundaries,\" others prefer the mid-paced breakdown of \"Die by the Sword,\" some prefer the catchy night stalker vibe of \"Tormentor,\" and even some love the mid-paced, fist-pumping \"Crionics,\" I settled on 100%--and probably the only album I'll ever call 100%--because I looked at every track and new that in some way each one held its purpose, each one deserved its place on the album, and even ones like \"The Final Command\" that seem out of place for the first twenty all of a sudden stamp out the tempo and riffs in a way still not yet demonstrated by the album. By the time the album is over--Slayer has never last place, showing something new on every track. \n\nShow No Mercy is pure power, a resident of its time, and a template for apprentices that wish to worship at the altar of metal. The best part of it--there's so much meat to take, it's fair enough to say that some of the potential of Show No Mercy is still untapped to this day. It can't be imitated, because it was already made so.\n",
        "\nI don't understand why this release is praised so much on here. Alas, that's something I have to live with and express my distaste for this full-length by writing a review on it. \"Undisputed Attitude\" is Slayer's attempt at crafting punk inspired thrash metal, running at around 35 minutes long in total. Even though you should never judge a book by its cover, the cover art of this musical atrocity is equally atrocious and should, in this case, be used considered as an appropriate presentation. \n\nMost of the songs are too fucking short to develop more than a couple of ideas for each \"song\", However, in hindsight, there isn't much variety between each of the 14 songs on this release. Most guitar work is restricted to power-chords with occasional thrash inspired riffs here and there just for the sake of keeping some sort of ungodly balance to this utter madness. Most of the solos are extremely well-executed and crafted masterfully and they're one of the two main factors in this album which helped in me endure the struggle that is listening to this full-length until the end. Most songs are really upbeat and the lyrics are dumbed down enough to have very sing-along choruses in every song. Tom's Voice sounds lifeless and void of energy. This downgrade would prove to be short-lasting because no other later release managed to sink to such a low level as \"Undisputed Attitude\" does so liberally. The bass work is really proficient and the few bass leads that are sprinkled here and there are enjoyable and frequent enough to merit a passing mention. The drumming on this release is the second saving grace for this album as it is really solid, well mixed and kept things fresh when all else failed. \n\nThe overall essence of this release is quite puzzling and this is because it sounds like a blatant cash grab and anomaly in Slayers' entire discography. The foundation upon which this release seems to be based on is what I sense to have been a constant drive to stay relevant in an increasingly fast-moving music scene. The painful irony about this entire situation is the fact that even though this release seems to have been an attempt by Slayer to stay relevant, it has been pushed to the wayside by the better quality of subsequent releases and seems to have been largely forgotten about by most fans. The music on here doesn't age well and the level of understanding Slayer had of \"hardcore punk\" at that certain point in time is frankly embarrassing. The level of creativity of most songs on here is shameful for a band that had released some legendary albums. At least I have the privilege to claim this release as an exceptional anomaly because I've always enjoyed all other releases from Slayer for the most part.\n",
        "\nThis album is iconic historically, but not musically, and because music reviews are supposed to be based around the music, (shocker, I know) I'm going to talk about this record from the perspective that I experienced it. I did not listen to this album when it was released in 1986. I was not alive in 1986. Therefore, I don't know exactly how much impact this record had in 1986, although I have a rough idea. It may have been extremely impactful and game-changing in 1986, but it hasn't stood the test of time as immaculately as some of Slayer's other albums have.\n\nAngel of Death is the opener, and one of the biggest Slayer songs. It's a fan favourite, and was the song that got me into Slayer. It's a great song, easily one of the best on the album, because it slows down in parts, and has enough riffs to keep you interested. Honestly, it's the most dynamic and contrasting this album gets, it's actually long enough to count as an actual song! (Unlike most of the songs from this album...) Anyway, the song is about the Nazi experiments conducted during World War II. In terms of songwriting, it's Slayer in their prime. The song has a dark and disturbing nature. The chaotic riffs fit so well with the twisted lyrics, and the only thing that ruins the song for me are the absolute dogshit solos. People say it's \"chaotic energy\", I say bullshit. You can make solos chaotic and still keep in tune with the music, maybe take a look at Sodom or Atrophy for proof? Anyway, that was one of the best songs on the album out of the way. Now get ready for 20 minutes of meh.\n\nThe majority of this album is filled with very mediocre fast-paced and short as shit songs. Tracks like Piece by Piece, Necrophobic, and Epidemic just seem to bleed into be satisfactory thrash metal, it's weird that songs that are extremely fast and energetic can be flavourless and even boring at the same time. Nevertheless, in the midst of all of these 90-150 second snooze-fests, there are some standouts. Jesus Saves and Criminally Insane are great because both have creative structures and interesting riffs, and of course Dave's incredible drumming isn't held back at all. The drum intro to Criminally Insane is haunting, and hooks you into the song. The riffs of that songs are groovy as all hell, and I just love Tom's vocals, he manages to stay consistently sinister. The song then slows down after the (terrible) solos performed by Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, and the drum intro is repeated, followed by a crazy and catchy riff. Jesus Saves also has a similar approach, with two bombastic and great intro riffs that make the song very enjoyable. That's the Slayer that I enjoy, when they manage to make songs gripping, unique and atmospheric. However, the main problem with this album is that most of the runtime goes against those stipulations. Like I said, songs such as Reborn and Altar of Sacrifice among many others are just bland songs with minimal riffs or changes, sometimes it just seems that Slayer were trying to go as fast as possible without remembering to write quality and memorable material. However, things massively improve during the last 7 minutes of the album.\n\nPostmortem and Raining Blood are the two final songs of the album, and they are my personal favourites. They blend together so well too, how the dramatic style of Postmortem suddenly crashes like a Boeing 747 going mayday into a mountain, and then Raining Blood comes in, with its iconic thunder intro, followed by one of the best riffs of Slayer's back catalogue. Honestly, both of these songs are awesome, everything about them, from the build-ups, to the blazing blast beats, to the slower parts that focus more on immersing the listener in the subject matter rather than just going full speed ahead and leaving the consumer mindlessly headbanging for 4 minutes. Either way, both sick tracks, and they are the main reasons you should pick this album up.\n\nThe production for this record was a huge step-up from Hell Awaits, and that may have something to do with Slayer signing to a major label, transferring from Metal Blade to Def Jam. The drums are mixed a lot better, the guitars have a chunkier tone, Tom's vocals have less reverb (I enjoyed his echoey vocals more to be honest), and overall the album sounds cleaner, more pleasing to the ear than the first two Slayer LPs. I feel like this new sound helped create the gallops that fill this album, and overall it's an improvement from Slayer's past material.\n\nOverall, I'll give this album a 7/10, because the good songs on here (Angel of Death, Jesus Saves, Altar of Sacrifice, Postmortem, Raining Blood) are absolutely great, classic songs, however there are some really mediocre, skippable songs (Necrophobic, Piece By Piece, Epidemic) that stain this disc and make it imperfect in my eyes. I'd say pick this album up for the good stuff, just don't expect a flawless masterpiece like everyone hypes it up to be.\n",
        "\nAfter five superb albums in reasonably quick succession we\u2019d then have to wait the better part of four years to see whether Slayer could match their pioneering delivery that helped drive metal from 1983 to 1990 \u2013 and I want to show why it\u2019s really important to see this album with some context. Clearly there had been a peak in the U.S. thrash metal genre in 1990 with releases like \u201cRust in Peace,\u201d \u201cPersistence of Time\u201d and Slayer\u2019s very own \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d but new dynamics were also coming into play. Death metal was exploding into the scene and thrash was all of a sudden not sounding necessarily as heavy as it had been in the mid-to-late 80s, and other young entrants to rock music in general were subjected to grunge and alternative rock bands. By the time we got to 1994 it was clear that Metallica had moved from the heavier and faster side of metal to their highly accessible form of hard rock, Megadeth were never going to make another proper thrash metal album, Anthrax just weren\u2019t Anthrax anymore, the formidable Pantera were strikingly powerful but just weren\u2019t dark enough to take Slayer\u2019s place, and Sepultura had clearly had their proper thrash peak by 1991. Given Slayer\u2019s position (at least in part) as godfathers of death metal, with the other key thrashers dwindling, and newbies to the scene drawn into trendier teenage sounds from Seattle you might have thought that Slayer would have had a clear run. For battery there'd been a worrying personnel change but new recruit Paul Bostaph had shown himself as Lombardo\u2019s great replacement at the Donington Monsters of Rock in \u201992 \u2013 he was the man among many to take Slayer forward.\n\nSo why does \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d not stand as proud as its predecessors? It\u2019d be an easy answer if there were one or more unmistakably inferior tracks on the album, if the whole release was slower than \u201cSeasons\u201d or \u201cSouth of Heaven,\u201d or if the lyrical themes showed the betrayal of a band who had gone mainstream \u2013 but none of these things are true. Simply put the problems with this album are in the mixing and production. The band had more time to plan and produce this record and somewhere along the line some spontaneity and decisiveness seems to have dropped off. For me this was the first Slayer album that I just cannot play quietly and still enjoy. The superb introductory drum fill that throws \u2018Killing Fields\u2019 at us \u2013 and this is one of Slayer\u2019s best songs \u2013 sadly says it all about how this album was made. And it matters because if this release had the engineering of the previous three albums we would have seen another Slayer high point. Bar the occasional unintended slowing down of the drums, mildly evident on \u2018Circle of Beliefs for example,\u2019 Bostaph\u2019s performance on the album is superb. He knew he had boots to fill and his efforts shine through on every song, it\u2019s just such a shame that his craft is blurred by the mix. The guitars and bass suffer the same fate. Instead of the crisp and crushing crunches and chugs we love so much it all feels just a little liquidy, and a tad cloudy, almost as though the album was recorded in multiple layers (and it certainly was). This is why this sterling effort in song-writing and musicianship still yields a record that doesn\u2019t quite make the grade. Araya himself said he thought it was one of their very best releases but it was recorded in more than one studio and the final output shows us that too many cooks do indeed spoil the broth.\n\nLooking at how the tracks came together in 1994 all of a sudden we see that Hanneman and King for the first time weren\u2019t writing as much together. For me whilst both Hanneman and King are both fantastic writers it\u2019s the popular belief that Hanneman had been the lead songwriter until this point. On \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d the music for the first half is entirely a King affair and for the whole release it is Araya\u2019s lyrical input making up for Hanneman\u2019s lesser contributions. Despite this the song-writing is still very much there and each track has its own individual character. The heaviest and most archetypal Slayer songs are \u2018Killing Fields\u2019 with its changing tempos (even 5/4 for a while?) and warlike aggression, and \u2018Sex, Murder, Art\u2019 with its ice cold and murderous freneticism. The climactic mid-song instrumental break in \u2018Fictional Reality\u2019 features tones to chill the spine before unleashing triumphant blows \u2013 relentlessly heavy, and though it\u2019s the one of the slower tracks on the album speed lovers will note that Slayer\u2019s \u201cSeasons\u201d from 1990 is, in all, actually a slower affair. If there\u2019s a filler or obvious hit-single for the record then \u2018Serenity in Murder\u2019 fits the bill but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s in any way such a disappointing compromise to let the release down \u2013 all the songs are quality Slayer. You\u2019ll just need to turn \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d up to 11 to give it what it deserves, and following the demise of Slayer if any of their records needed re-engineering it\u2019s this one. A superb effort but with too much interference. Re-master please.\n",
        "\nTo get it out of the way, 'Divine Intervention' for me is tied with 'Hell Awaits' as their best album. This album has a pretty divided opinion, and while I understand it's different than their previous work in tone and (somewhat in) style, I believe those changes were necessary.\n\nI brought up 'Hell Awaits' because it has the most in common with 'Divine Intervention'. Aside from sounding like Slayer, they don't really sound alike, but they have significantly more complicated song structures than their albums they're most known for (Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss). Maybe that's a contributing factor as to why this album is seen as their first 'mediocre' album or a 'beginning of the end' of sorts. I can agree with the latter.\n\nWith the added technicality in the songwriting, Slayer also brought contemporary influences from the period. Some of the riffing points to their later groove-era which would be expanded upon on the following album. That album in particular was essentially the end of Slayer for me, 'Christ Illusion' was a return to form of sorts and their only album to date post '94 I can enjoy, so that's up to personal opinion. There also seems to be a very slight death metal influence on their sound here, which arguably began with 'Reign in Blood', but moreso contemporary death metal here.\n\nIt's also relevant to mention that 'Divine Intervention' has more variety of song lengths than the previous album, and yet the album is very cohesive in style. This was my biggest problem with 'Seasons in the Abyss'; it sounded like they just wanted to rehash 'Reign in Blood' and 'South of Heaven' rather than do something new. There were developments that carried over to Divine Intervention, however. Those developments were expanded on greatly here and that's honestly one of my favorite parts of the album.\n\nThe only other things I can touch on is the lyrics, they seem to be more offensive and influenced by contemporary metal. Themes of more transgressive topics such as sadism and rape are touched upon (as far as I know, this was a new development). To my understanding, this album took roughly 4 years to produce, and I'd guess that this kind of lyrics were influenced by Cannibal Corpse among other death metal bands. The song 'Serenity in Murder' also marked the first time Tom has used clean vocals. This might seem like an incredibly bad thing for Slayer, but the song is in the more 'creepy' style such as 'South of Heaven' and 'Spill the Blood'. Very nice touch. \n\nNow for the negatives. The production is very strange and thin. Were they going for a more raw, underproduced sound? It's hard to say. Slayer's guitar tone choices from here on were always odd to me, it almost seemed like they were afraid to use heavier-sounding tones because it was their thrash-era trademark? The drums are also very raw sounding, but also very pronounced. It sounds as if the drums were heavily mic'd but in a way that makes them sound more natural, which was an odd choice for the time. Very little noticeable bass guitar as usual aside from a bass fill were the track was made audible briefly. Another reason I love Hell Awaits was the pronounced bass. Also, Paul is unfortunately not Dave Lombardo and despite his very solid effort, Dave's presence is noticeably absent. \n\nTo sum it up, times were changing and Slayer were at a crossroads in sound. Despite that, they made an incredibly solid effort to keep playing thrash in a way that didn't sound completely out of place in 1994. It's possibly underrated for a reason, but I love it anyway. From the 2000s on, thrash has had a revival, but instead of trying to do anything new with the genre, most bands are just stuck in the 80s and refuse to do anything new or interesting with it. This isn't always the case, but I don't personally find retro-jerking interesting. Slayer unfortunately gave into the times after this album to mixed results. They at least hung in there better than the rest of the big four, so I can give them that.\n",
        "\nThis is a hallmark album in metal and one of the cornerstone thrash releases from 1986, coming out alongside \"Master of Puppets\" and \"Peace Sells\", among others. This album, however, was the most brutal, intense and evil-sounding of all of them. It was also the fastest, being played at over 200 bpm and clocking in just under 29 minutes. Slayer were helping to blur the line between metal and hardcore punk. But as time passed by and people gave the album another listen, free from the excitement and hype, many had less than kind opinions to share. No longer are people so floored and impressed by the speed or the frightening lyrics. I consider myself one of these people.\n\nStarting on a positive note, this album has great production. It makes me wish the first two albums had this level of care given to them, although I will say that the drums come through a bit more than they should and they seem to overpower the other instruments. In addition there are some good songs here, like \"Angel of Death\", \"Postmortem\", and of course \"Raining Blood\", but even in these songs problems start becoming evident. For you see, Slayer employs their 'one trick' for this album, and that's to play as fast as is humanly possible. This applies across the board, whether it's the rhythm guitar, the lead guitar, the drums, even the vocals are sung as quickly as Tom can get them out of his mouth, like a broken faucet gushing out with violent force. This trick isn't new to Slayer, but on this album it takes center stage. \n\nThe best tracks on this album are the ones that don't suffer from this affliction. \"Angel of Death\" is as well-regarded as it is because it takes its time: whether it's to go into that cool rhythm at about the 1:30 mark, or the fact that you can hear what Tom's singing about. If they had cut out those 2 minutes where they slowed things down, the song would've suffered greatly. Same goes for \"Raining Blood\". What's the most famous part of that song? Is it the part where they play really, really fast? No, it's the first 40 seconds, with the rain and thunder intro, followed by that riff. I feel like those two songs earn the privilege to play at blistering speeds later on because they took their time and built up to it. \"Necrophobic\" seems like it can't wait to play really, really fast and it becomes completely forgettable because of it, fading into the background as a blur of noise. On top of that its name is so close to the song \"Necrophiliac\" from the previous album, giving the impression that Slayer is already out of ideas.\n\n\"Altar of Sacrifice\" almost teases you with its intro, before going into overdrive literally three seconds in. Even the better songs on this album, like \"Jesus Saves\" and \"Criminally Insane\" are cursed with Slayer's compulsive need to kick it into high gear. Tracks like \"Reborn\" and \"Epidemic\" are so unremarkable they have been lost to the annals of times, despite being on such a landmark release. The worst causality in all of this, I think, is the track \"Postmortem\", the third best song on this album, right behind \"Raining Blood\" and \"Angel of Death\". It takes its time and doesn't go insane until the last 45 seconds or so, and it's all the better for it. Despite all that though, it is forgotten, lost among all the mediocrity. It deserved better.\n\nThis album is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand it sounds great sonic-ally, but with all that production sheen there's little to listen to. How ironic.\n",
        "\nI see metal in two eras; before and after \"Reign in Blood\". This was the line in the sand from which there could be no return. Yes, there had already been some extreme and influential albums (\"Seven Churches\", \"Black Metal\", \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Bathory\", etc.), but \u201cReign in Blood\u201d was the moment of clarity. This was when the monster that had thus far lurked in the shadows finally caught sight of itself in broad daylight. Those in the metal scene saw what had happened; the stakes had risen to such a ludicrous extent that many bands were plunged into soul searching, wondering whether it was worth carrying on. Some never recovered. Those outside the metal world watched with interest as well. They wanted to know whether they needed to be afraid or whether it was just juvenile posturing. Only time would tell, but nothing would be the same again. \n\nNot that I was around back then. I was alive, but too young for this sort of thing. I certainly remember the first time I heard this album though. I was twelve or thirteen. I didn't know much about metal, but an older friend had already introduced me to \"South of Heaven\" and \"Seasons in the Abyss\" (which had just been released). I loved everything about those albums. The menacing sound, the catchiness, those evil note combinations borrowed from simple classical melodies. My friend told me to buy \"Reign in Blood\". He said that it was supposed to be the best Slayer album. In hindsight, I think he had an ulterior motive because he hadn't heard the album and wanted me to copy it for him. This was all the information I needed. With some pocket money I went to my local record shop and bought it. I couldn't afford the CD version, so I bought the tape version instead. I stuck it in my tape deck and blasted it a couple of times. In all honesty, I was disappointed. I didn't recognise any of the songs and the whole album was over as soon as it began. I had just spent \u00a36.99 on this tape and expected more music for my money. \n\nI cannot remember the precise moment when my opinion changed, but it must have been early in my relationship with the album (let's say six months). I\u2019m familiar with the concept of \u2018growers\u2019, albums that don\u2019t immediately grab you but sink in after many listens. Often this happens because you\u2019re missing a vital piece of the puzzle and you need to find it before the album will click. Many of my favourite albums are like this. This wasn't the case with \"Reign in Blood\". No-one ever called this album a \u2018grower\u2019. The reason it didn\u2019t click for me on first listen is simple: I wasn't ready for it. Imagine trying to jump onto a moving train as it leaves the station (health and safety laws once allowed passengers to do such things). You can only catch the train if you're running fast enough in the first place. If you\u2019re too slow or too late, the train accelerates away and you must sit on the platform and wait for the next one, a dispiriting feeling. It was the same for me with \u201cReign in Blood\u201d. This is an album that requires you to be 'up to speed' with it. It didn\u2019t take me long, a few more listens and I knew what was required, I ran faster and earlier, and I jumped aboard. At that moment the ride began. That ride happened to be the best fucking metal album of all time. \n\nHighlighting individual moments (or even individual songs) on \u201cReign in Blood\u201d is beyond futile. I could mention a couple of songs, a few of my favourite riffs, fills, iconic screams and all that. Why bother? This album was released in 1986 and every second of it has been dissected to oblivion. There aren't any hidden secrets on here that haven't already been discussed. This album is not about individual moments, riffs or songs. This album is a masterpiece. Masterpieces should be approached on their own terms, whole, unfiltered, unadulterated. To experience \"Reign in Blood\" is to experience the unbroken thread, the spine that runs through it. No other metal album in history has such a constant, consistent drive. The fact that this album contains two of the classic songs in metal history is of secondary importance. What happens between these two songs is what matters. \n\nTo demonstrate this point. Go and listen to \"Reborn\u201d right now. It won't take long (just over two minutes)... Done? That song is not very impressive when taken out of context, is it? Sure, there are some chuggy bits, some cool vocal patterns, but \"Reborn\" is nothing special as a song. That is because it wasn't meant to be listened to on its own. It only works as \"Track #7\", where it becomes an essential, inexorable part of the momentum, the thread that binds everything together. I could demonstrate this point further by criticising the guitar solos. The leads on this album are not very good are they? Isn't it a shame that someone like Alex Skolnick or Marty Friedman isn't playing them instead? Again, focusing on individual ingredients like this is missing the point. The solos on \"Reign in Blood\" are expressionistic, they aim to evoke the screams of tortured victims in hell. Criticising this album for the objective musical quality of the solos is like criticising Picasso's \"Guernica\" for the unrealistic depiction of animals. \n\nOK, I\u2019ll concede one paragraph to describing some details, but let\u2019s focus on details that enhance the album's cohesive vision. First, \u201cReign in Blood\u201d is the most lyrically menacing metal album ever. Slayer's lyrics are often overlooked but they are poetic in the way they portray society's darkest recesses. Hanneman and King were both above average for metal lyricists and they complement each other well (King's lyrics rhyme, Hanneman's do not). Second, the production is the best I've ever heard on a metal record. Rick Rubin and Andy Wallace achieved greatness by giving this album a loud, clear sound that transcends the ages. Third, the cover art is among the most iconic and brilliant in metal history (along with \"Kill 'Em All\" and \"Black Sabbath\"). It is a perfect homage to the likes of Hieronymus Bosch and El Greco. Some of the images will burn their way into your brain, never to be forgotten. Other images will go unnoticed. If I sat and stared at the album cover now, I would be certain to find new things I\u2019d never seen before. What is true for the artwork is also true for the music. Details matter. \n\nThe strange thing about the metal scene is how people take such an obvious masterpiece for granted. Reviewing \"Reign in Blood\" is not like reviewing a personal favourite obscure death metal demo. This album isn't just a metal classic, it is a music classic. How often does metal (particularly extreme metal) get any respect from outside the niche circles in which it exists? Hardly ever. \"Reign in Blood\" is the one album that people from outside the metal circle will hear, perhaps in awe. How often does an extreme metal album make an indelible mark on wider music history? If you're a metalhead and this album doesn\u2019t make you feel a sense of pride within your soul, then you\u2019re doing something wrong.\n",
        "\n\"Reign in Blood\". What can I say about the album that millions of others haven't already said? Released in 1986 along with Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\", Megadeth's \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\", and Iron Maiden's \"Somewhere in Time\", this album helped contribute to one of heavy metal's biggest year yet. It's the album that officially got Slayer into the mainstream, and was a massive improvement to their previous works. Today, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest thrash metal albums of all time, and one of the best albums Slayer has ever put out. But is it really that great?\n\nBefore I go any further, I need to clarify and say that I don't hate this album. In fact, it's pretty good for what it's worth. However, I'd argue that \"Reign in Blood\" is slightly overrated by some songs off the album. While its highlights are an amazing listening experience, the rest are more of a hit or miss. Plenty of songs are fantastic, while others are more forgettable.\n\nNow let's get the elephants in the room out-of-the-way first: \"Angel of Death\" and \"Raining Blood\". Both of these tracks are amazing as the intro and outro of the album. \"Angel of Death\" starts off with some fast-paced guitar riffs from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. King and Hanneman's guitar skills are generally fantastic in this album, and his performance in \"Angel of Death\" is excellent. They have a harsh tone in them, and bring in an atmosphere of rage. Tom Araya's vocal performance here is also great. His voice is filled with shouts and anger to them, sounding like a crazy man. The vocals flow well with the fast-paced guitar riffs and banging drums. The lyrics are also just as violent, as Araya is singing about unethical experiments in Auschwitz. The lyrics go in detail about the painful experiments, and has descriptive moments of the subjects getting their brains melted. And then there's the breakdown that happens around the 3:33 mark. This moment includes one of the most chaotic moments in the band's entire discography, with extremely fast guitar riffs, and Dave Lombardo banging the drums extremely fast. Overall, \"Angel of Death\" brings in a chaotic, violent atmosphere, and serves as one of the best moments on the album.\n\nThen there's \"Raining Blood\". The song isn't as crazed and fast as \"Angel of Death\", but it's more of an epic moment of the album. We start off with rain playing in the background, as the drums play in a slow, sinister pattern. This brings in a mysterious atmosphere in the song, as the listener gets an eerie feeling from it. Then the guitars kick in, Jeff does more of the guitars here, and his performance is amazing. The guitar riff is a bit slower, but has a melodic pattern in it that makes it memorable. Araya also goes for a more epic vocal performance, with less screaming and more chanting of the lyrics. The lyrics are more simplistic, with details on falling into hell. However, its execution is fantastic with the more epic style of the instruments, and fits well with the vocals of Tom. We then move into the breakdown, and this one includes more noise, with the guitar riffs being more inconsistent, and the drums beating extremely fast and in random patterns. It then cuts to a lightning strike, and then the rest of the song is ambient rain. While \"Raining Blood\" isn't as good as \"Angel of Death\", its epic atmosphere is executed well with the melodic and sinister instruments, and Tom's vocals are also one of his greatest performances yet. I highly recommend both of these songs.\n\nNow for the rest of the album. As I've stated earlier, they're more of a hit or miss. When the songs are good, they still pack a punch, though not as much as \"Angel of Death\". A good example of this is \"Criminally Insane\". We start off with a drum performance with lots of hits with the cymbals and snares. We then move on to the guitar riffs, which are fast, but feel more of a downgrade to those from \"Angel of Death\". Araya's vocal performance is good, with his chants and screams giving his voice a strong tone. The lyrics also talk about a monster killing humans. While it doesn't hit as hard as some of the other songs, it still works good overall with its good composition and nice lyricism.\n\nHowever, for the rest that aren't as good, they come off as underwhelming, and even forgettable. One example of this is \"Necrophobic\". The instruments play fast, but they don't feel like they have a purpose. It's almost like they're trying to top \"Angel of Death\", but they're missing something. Tom's vocals also sound a bit off, with more of a mumbling voice, and at times even sounding a bit childish. There are some moments where I can barely understand what he's saying not because of the fast speed, but because of the mumbling. Even the lyrics seem bland, as there are gory descriptions for the sake of gory descriptions. The song comes off as the band trying too hard to be edgy, but are failing miserably. At least the tone of \"Raining Blood\" had a purpose.\n\nOverall, \"Reign in Blood\" is good album overall, but not as good as many people make it out to be. The highlights of the album are fantastic, especially \"Angel of Death\" and Raining Blood\". The rest, however, sound underwhelming with a more mediocre sound and excessive lyrics. I like this album, and I feel like it deserves to be praised for being such. However, it is a bit overrated since many people who praise the album only talk about 2-3 songs. I'd still recommend this album to anyone who's looking for a more extreme vibe though.\n",
        "\nThere's an unwritten rule in the MA where if you're gonna write reviews, you have to do at least 1 review for a Slayer album. I can understand why that is, as they're the first band I think of whenever someone mentions thrash metal. While the other three big bands had their fast moments, no other band had better fast moments than Slayer, and one of the best examples of that is this EP. It only has three songs, but each one includes fast thrash riffs and brutal lyrics about the dead, all combined to make a perfect Slayer EP.\n\nThe first song of the EP is \"Chemical Warfare\". We start off with an excellent guitar riff from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. When the drums and bass kicks in, we are hit with an atmosphere of chaos and violence. Tom Araya's vocals are also great, as his voice is filled with hate and anger, and flow well with the instruments. The lyrics are also poetic, with descriptions of war and death, and are executed well with the harsh vocals and the aggressive atmosphere. The overall quality of the song is excellent with fast, shredding guitar riffs and Araya's harsh vocals. It's one of the best songs off the EP.\n\nThe next song, \"Captor of Sin\", is more of a mix between thrash and traditional heavy metal, but still includes some great moments. The beginning of the song is iconic, with an amazing guitar solo performance from King and Hanneman. Araya also switches up his vocals on this song, going for a more crazed tone with a bit more slurring. The lyrical theme now deals with being in hell and include descriptive moments of someone being attacked by Satan. It's one of the more underrated songs off the EP, and still has excellent moments.\n\nThe EP ends with the self-titled song \"Haunting the Chapel\". The guitar riff sounds similar to the one in \"Chemical Warfare\", but has more of an off-key tone, giving it an unique sound. Araya goes for a faster voice, as he sings about destroying a church. The lyricism here is more powerful than ever, being helped by the banging drums and fast guitar riffs. Dave Lombardo's drumming skills in this EP is good, but he particularly shines here with a faster beat and more powerful. The overall song is just as chaotic as the previous two, and serves as a nice conclusion.\n\nEvery second of this EP is packed with aggression, chaos, and power. The band members improved from their previous debut album, and come with more poetic stories and dramatic sounds. It is an EP I would recommend to pretty much any fan of thrash metal.\n",
        "\nIt has been said before that the 90s were not particularly kind to the previous generation of metal bands. Many fell off the radar or emerged completely remodeled. One would think that if any band would stick their finger to the soulless trends happening at that time, it would be good ol' Slayer. From reading the lore on this album, I thought that's exactly what they did.\n\nThe previous album, Seasons in the Abyss, got me so excited for this album. Slayer had mastered the art of mixing thrash with a sinister, creepy atmosphere. This album took everything they mastered and threw it away.\n\nUpon starting this album, we are warmly greeted with a glorious drum fill from Paul Bostaph as a statement that he has now joined the band he is not going to disappoint. Things sort of go pear-shaped afterwards as the song, Killing Fields, loses any sense of direction. At times it feels like every band member is playing the bare minimum of a Slayer song with Tom Araya sometimes talking and sometimes moaning over the music. All this is also heavily buried beneath extremely dull production.\n\nThis is basically the trend for the rest of the album. Almost none of the tracks stand out, most of the riffs sound the same and the drumming is very mid-paced throughout the album. The atmosphere that made Seasons in the Abyss so good is almost no longer present and the speed of the previous albums has been replaced by generic groove metal riffs which unfortunately, Slayer do not do well.\n\nThe album isn't all bad all the time, however. 213 is a dark, unsettling gem about Jeffrey Dahmer. Mind Control and Circle of Beliefs are half decent, showing us the good parts of this album but would be basic filler on any other decent Slayer album. \n\nThe real highlight of this album is Dittohead which is exactly what I go looking for on a Slayer album. It's true to their sound yet more developed than many of their early works. It shows real evolution of the band and most importantly it doesn't sound unnatural or like they're trying to bend to the trends.\n\nAll in all, It think this album could have been so much better and a beacon of light in the dark decade of the 90s but ended up being another lazy, confused album by a legendary band similar to Dio's Angry Machines. With this album, I see the trend that eventually lead them to Diabolus in Musica which is an even lower point.\n\nHighlights on the album: Dittohead, 213, Circle of Beliefs\n",
        "\nOnly 21 reviews (as of January 2020) for Hell Awaits, as compared to 38 for Reign in Blood? Even though I\u2019m not sure the world\u2014or the Encyclopaedia Metallum, for that matter\u2014needs yet another review for Hell Awaits, and even though Reign in Blood is an excellent and groundbreaking album in its own right, something about this imbalance bothers me. After all, I\u2019m firmly convinced that it is in fact Slayer\u2019s sophomore effort Hell Awaits that ought to be regarded as this fab four\u2019s finest hour. Hell Awaits isn\u2019t technically or musically perfect, but it boasts a spine-tingling atmosphere that is unlike any other Slayer album and, to put it in a broader context, unlike most other thrash albums as well. The second wave of black metal certainly owes a lot to it, as this\u2014along with the early works of bands like Sodom, Sepultura, Destruction and others\u2014is one of the early examples of the subgenre that today is usually referred to as black(ened) thrash.\n\nWhen speaking of this album\u2019s unique atmosphere, adjectives like dismal, sickening, diabolic or simply evil come to mind. This isn\u2019t Slayer\u2019s most aggressive or heaviest output, nor is it their fastest or most refined, but it is undoubtedly their most menacing and morbid. The rather raw\u2014and, objectively speaking, quite shoddy\u2014production values undoubtedly have a hand in this. The guitars do not yet have the same crunch and bite as on Reign in Blood and later efforts. On the contrary, they sound rather sludgy and muffled, accentuating the occasionally doomy quality of the riffs. Then there are the drums, which are rather high in the mix but recorded with lots and lots of reverb. When I listened to this, my first Slayer album, as a fledgeling metalhead, I was quite irritated and taken aback, as this was not the Slayer I had heard of or anticipated. It took me several years and my first forays into the realm of black metal to fully appreciate it and to come to the inevitable conclusion that not only does Hell Awaits sound precisely the way it should, but would not even be nearly as good with the crisper, cleaner, more polished production Slayer had on subsequent releases. Hell Awaits with a Reign in Blood sound? The mere thought almost seems absurd.\n\nAnother factor contributing heavily to the aforementioned diabolic vibe are the lyrics in conjunction with Tom Araya\u2019s masterful vocals, which mostly consist of raspy shouting occasionally interspersed with high-pitched screams (the protracted one in \u201cCrypts of Eternity\u201d being the most impressive). At a cursory glance, the lyrical themes do not seem out of the ordinary at all. We have, in no particular order, extreme metal staples such as: hell, Satan, the occult, violence, death, serial killers, vampires \u2026 Okay, necrophilia might have been a, shall we say, bold issue to tackle in 1985, and in such graphic terms no less. But it\u2019s not so much the themes themselves, it\u2019s the way they are presented. When in \u201cKill Again\u201d, for instance, Araya frantically and with eerie conviction belts out his lyrics about a savage serial killer who will, \u201cwith no apparent motive, just kill and kill again\u201d, he does not merely sing about that raving lunatic. It\u2019s rather he himself who becomes that lunatic. Likewise in \u201cNecrophiliac\u201d, when he sings about a mentally deranged sicko who digs out rotten corpses in order to satisfy his perverted sexual impulses, he does not merely describe him; he himself becomes that necrophile. You can almost picture Araya with shovel in hand, hastily disinterring a casket on some old decrepit graveyard, lifting the lid and leering lustfully at the ghastly content. The subtly melodic guitar leads only add to the sickening, vile and twisted mood, making this the blackest and, along with the title track and \u201cKill Again\u201d, perhaps the best song on Hell Awaits.\n\nBut wait\u2014no discussion of the best songs on Hell Awaits could ever be complete without the one that might be the best of them all; actually it\u2019s so good it even warrants its own paragraph. Songs about vampires are far from a rarity in metal, but rarely has the topic been dealt with so convincingly and so authentically. After all, \u201cAt Dawn They Sleep\u201d is not about your well-groomed, satin-cloaked, aristocratic, cunningly seductive bloodsuckers in the vein of Bram Stoker\u2019s rather urbane villain Dracula. No, this digs right down at the folkloristic roots of the vampire legend and depicts these nocturnal fiends as they were imagined by our ancestors\u2014something to be unequivocally feared and spoken of only in terms of sheer terror and dread. The vampires in \u201cAt Dawn They Sleep\u201d are literally apparitions from the depths of hell: undead, zombie-like, sharp-fanged corpses risen from their shallow peasant graves to haunt and feed upon their still living relatives or fellow villagers. Similar to \u201cNecrophiliac\u201d, the sparingly but effectively used guitar leads do a lot to enhance the deeply unsettling, almost nauseatingly evil aura of this track. You can almost smell the damp earth, rotting wood and overpowering stench of decomposing corpses dressed in filthy rags, as they slowly rise from their graves, beginning their nocturnal ambulations in search for fresh human blood to sustain and revitalize their decaying bodies. Plodding along rather slowly, yet all the more menacingly, for most of its duration before unexpectedly erupting into a burst of speed for its grand finale, \u201cAt Dawn They Sleep\u201d is without a doubt one of the most terrifying and also one of the most brilliant tracks Slayer have ever written.\n\nNow, instead of endlessly rambling on about individual tracks and how great they are, suffice it to say that Hell Awaits as a whole is an album even greater than the sum of its parts. Everything here just clicks and what slight imperfections it has in terms of songwriting, musicianship and production are easily offset by its youthful charm and energy and, most importantly, the downright demonic atmosphere it creates. Not everyone may recognize its genius right away, but in due time most will agree that Hell Awaits is a stunning, one-of-a-kind display of brilliance that sounds exactly the way it should and has stood the test of time as perhaps the crown jewel of Slayer\u2019s decade-spanning career.\n\nChoicest cuts: Hell Awaits, Kill Again, At Dawn They Sleep, Necrophiliac\n\nRating: 9.5 out of 10 points\n",
        "\nI have listened to a lot of Slayer in my life. If there's one thing that stands out the most about them it's that their albums as a whole aren't very good. They're pretty bland and boring in retrospect. I am speaking in the perspective of someone who didn't grow up in a time where they were the heaviest band out there. However, this is definitely their heaviest album, no doubt. Let's take a look at Repentless by Slayer.\n\nThe instrumentation is the typical Slayer formula: a bunch of cool riffs, shreddy guitar solos, skank beats, and yelling vocals. However, despite being formulaic, I feel this album followed the Slayer formula best. The instruments used are what you would expect in a metal band: guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. The best things about the guitar are obviously the riffs. The worst thing is the guitar solos. I know I might get shit for this, but I hate Slayer's guitar solos so much. That is the only problem this album did not fix. The guitar solos are genuinely overuse the whammy bar and sound way too chaotic. That's coming from someone who listens to noisegrind. The bass doesn't really play anything different from the guitar and the drums are nothing special.\n\nThe vocals have absolutely no technique. It's basically just yelling vocals the whole time, which is fine by me since this is a thrash metal album. However, I feel like vocal technique is just something I should point out in an album review. Tom Araya does play bass during the vocals so I will give him credit for at least doing something that I couldn't do.\n\nSomething I notice about most thrash metal albums is that there doesn't seem to be much focus when it comes to the tones of the bass and guitars. Usually, they seem to either just have a typical distorted tone or they just give it the Dimebag tone. This album is no different. Therefore, I won't talk about the equalization like I usually do in my reviews since that should give you a basic idea of it. The production value is decent and gets the job done.\n\nTime for the outro. The best thing about this album and basically every other Slayer album is the riffs. The worst thing about the album is definitely the guitar solos. Call me crazy, but I just can't stand them. My favorite tracks are Repentless and You Against You. Overall, this may be the best Slayer album, but it's still nothing special.\n",
        "\nHell Awaits, an album that's oft debated to be ground zero for what would become the early death metal sound and Slayer's second full length effort. When reviewing a staple album with a legacy such as this its often important to separate influence from quality, but fortunately many classics live up on their own and Hell Awaits is no different. \n\nThis album comes out swinging with everything it would need to get a high score. It has the crunchy thrash riffing, it has well utilized and tasty solos, it has the skank beats, it has some low death metal-esque growls that occur throughout the opening track which I would assume was an influential sound to a lot of the 80s underground metal scene. The best part is this is all merely packed into the opening track, which might actually be one of the weaker, or less good I should say.\n\nIt also features the emphasis on instrumentals that was found on Show No Mercy that didn't carry over to some Slayer's other work, Kill Again for example goes for about a minute and half, over a fourth of its run time, and goes through a riff change before the vocals enter and when the vocals do enter Tom goes into full on shrieking for the last half a minute or so which just gives such a perfect emphasis to the lines while remaining intelligible. The fact that that track also features one of the most catchy moments in metal with the \"kill kill again\" line is icing on the cake. You get to the third track in and you hit that little section at the end where Lombardo is allowed to just go off for a few seconds and you hit yet another song that stands out for itself in the mass bulk that is Slayer's career.\n\nWhile Reign in Blood is typically considered the hardest and most extreme Slayer album, it does not match Hell Awaits in how dark its overall theme is. While the albums cover much of the same subject matter, Hell Awaits has a more visceral and in depth description and choice of words, while also building up more atmosphere instrumentally. This is what gives Hell Awaits its stand out place in in Slayer's discography, it does not have the hefty focus on illustrious guitar work and riffing that Show No Mercy does, it does not have the brutality of Reign in Blood and it isn't as overtly edgy or over the top as God Hates Us All, it is however unmatched in the band's discography in its atmosphere and attention to detail.\n",
        "\nI remember my first experience with this was bumping into it at the local public library one time (the library also had Megadeth's Warchest on the shelf), in fact that might have also been my first in depth experience with Slayer, so of course I've had really good feelings about this comp for years even as my general opinion of comp albums has slowly diminished. So when I decided to kick off a string of Slayer reviews I did feel inclined to check this out again and found that my opinion of it has diminished pretty heftily.\n\nThe first red flag for me here is that the track listing doesn't include any studio recordings from Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits, which I would both list as being Slayer's two best albums. Of course there's live recordings for material from these albums, but in general these two albums seem to be overlooked. The general track run down for the first disc (and about half of the second is the five most popular tracks off of Slayer albums starting with Reign in Blood and going chronologically to God Hates Us All and starting with Undisputed Attitude dropping from 5 tracks off each to just 3. 3 live tracks from Decade of Aggression (1 cut Show No Mercy, one from hell Awaits and one from Haunting the Chapel) do appear in between the tracks from Seasons in the Abyss and Divine Intervention. This means that every major release, live album included, from 1986 to 2001 is represented here. This part of the comp is the throw away section because of course, anyone that wanted that material likely already already owned the respective albums they cared for. Disc one is called 'Best Of', preumably because it does just function as a greatest Hits selection.\n\nIts halfway into disc 2 where we start getting material that actually starts justifying this box set as its own product. 2 tracks being pulled from soundtracks, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and Disorder respectively, both are covers. Then another cover which was a bonus track from the japanese edition of Undisputed Attitude. Another soundtrack cut 'Human Disease' and then 4 more bonus tracks from Undisputed Attitude and God hates Us All. This disc I can see being justified as it saves people from having to splurge on a bunch of extra expensive albums and soundtracks just to get a full collection. This section is also split up chronologically.\n\nDisc 3 is probably the most worthwhile disc from a collector's stand point, as unlike with the other 2 discs, as this material is stuff you can't find anywhere else. On the other hand though with the exception of Ice Titan, a song which predates Show No Mercy and doesn't appear anywhere else this is all just demos and live recordings. Just songs you've heard before but with worse sound quality. I mean I enjoy Ice Titan, its a good song, but hearing a literal garage recording of The Antichrist is a bit of a novelty experience to say the least. Of course though the organization on this disc feels scattered as a product, especially since 'No Remorse (I Wanna Die)' should have been packed on to disc 2.\n\nDisc 4 is a DVD, and also is content that's only available via this comp so this could also be a score for collectors as well, not as much musically as disc 3 since there's no songs that are available here and here only, but there's a lot of live footage and some interviews you can watch on here.\n\nOf course though, like all comps this is a cash grab, and what better way to cash grab than to give the comp album bonus content as well. The existence of disc 5 is the only reason I'm giving this a 55% instead of 70%, because when the physical box already starts at $96.99 on Amazon and a median sale value of $85 on discogs.com in the year 2019, I can only dread how pricey this was back in 2003 and prior to online streaming making it largely obsolete, never mind slapping on another disc to push that price even further through the roof. How much live music are they gonna tack on to this thing, seriously.\n",
        "\nPicture this: you're Slayer. You've just released Reign in Blood. It is an extreme metal classic and is recognised as such on release. It is commercially successful, too, and has attracted tons of controversy. It is fast and lean, under half an hour long, and contains instantly iconic and recognisable songs. How the hell do you follow that up?\n\nThe answer, of course, was to slow down. After pushing thrash to such limits, Slayer had no choice, else suffer from making the same album twice (which they did end up doing, but that's for another time). Rick Rubin is back on the boards, Dave Lombardo is back after a very short absence, Jeff Hanneman has written most of the riffs due to Kerry King's absence - he moved house and got married - and Tom Araya steps up his lyrical game. Oh, and his vocals are still manic and crazed but in a more measured way.\n\nJust to make this clear, South of Heaven is not doom metal. There are too many faster, thrashier moments for it to qualify. It does, though, have a sense of doom and dread running throughout which is arguably more potent than Reign in Blood. Whilst Reign is a blink and you'll miss it slideshow of atrocity, disease, murder, death and agony, South of Heaven is that same slideshow but with a crippling inevitability. As a result, it's pretty intense, as song by song you get the feeling that something horrifying is about to happen, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nCompared to the anti-reverb machinery of Reign in Blood, the production of South of Heaven focuses heavily on Dave Lombardo's drumming. They're fucking huge on this album. They never sounded better on record. As a result, Tom Araya's vocals are a little buried in the mix which could put off listeners who love the more upfront approach on Hell Awaits or Reign. The guitars are a bit drier than previously, which again is an acquired taste, but one I have acquired. \n\nTrack by track, it might not have the seamless album flow that Reign in Blood does. It also may lack a bookends of classic songs. To me, though, South of Heaven works better as an album because individual songs stick out to me more than on Reign. And I defend that album from the usual \"songs sound the same\" criticism. What's more, South of Heaven contains personal favourites of mine, and all in one place. \n\nThe title track opens with an iconic riff, eventually building with the addition of divebombing harmonics, drum strikes and fills. When Araya's vocals come in, you can hear the bomb ticking, about to go off; \"before you see the light, you must DIIIIEEEE!\" And with that, the slowburning opener is off. The riffing, mostly courtesy of Hanneman, alternates between being doomy and ominous to outright attacking in the verses, whereby the drums come out of their mid-tempo groove and into more familiar thrash territory. The lyrics, intriguingly for Slayer, do not actually consider South of Heaven to be about Hell: it's about Earth.\n\nForgotten children confirm a new faith\nAvidity and lust controlled by hate\nThe never ending search for your shattered sanity\nSouls of damnation in their own reality\n\nChaos rampant in age of distrust\nConfrontations impulsive habitat\n\nThe chorus is something of a great pay off, in my opinion. The pre-chorus - \"CHAOS! RAMPANT!\" etc - leads you to believe something is upcoming, only for the main riff to come back in and repeat the process. As per most Slayer songs, the solos are a trade off between Hanneman and King, with each bringing their distinctive styles together at various points. The closing of the song is nearly a minute long of sustained feedback, ringing in the ears. Yes, this is my favourite Slayer song, and the perfect way to open the album, spelling out that this will not be a retread of their 1986 classic.\n\nDespite its reputation of being much slower than its predecessor, South of Heaven contains pretty aggressive and thrashing fast songs. The title track fades into the next song, Silent Scream, which is nonstop and break neck in its precision and its power. A song about back alley abortions - whether its pro-life or pro-choice I don't know and honestly don't want to go into - Silent Scream contains nightmarish vocals, flawless drumming (check out Lombardo's fills on the track and his double bass attack, borderline blast beasting!!!), and lyrics designed to both intrigue and horrify. Whatever side of the debate you sit on - pro choice myself - it leaves an impact.\n\nSilent Scream\nCrucify the bastard son\nBeaten and torn\nSanctify lives of scorn\n\nInnocence withdrawn in fear\nFires burning can you hear\nCries in the night\n\nOther thrashier numbers include Ghosts of War, with its haunted opening couple of bars, leading right into the song. Also notable is its doomy mid-section. Like most of the album, the themes seem to concern duty over free will, as on the WWII inspired Behind the Crooked Cross. Like a lot of Slayer songs, it's related to the Nazis (don't even go there), but from the perspective of the average German man conscripted into the army. It's actually a very sympathetic song, reminding us that people died in the war regardless of the side.\n\nTime melts away in this living inferno\nTrapped by a cause that I once understood\nFeeling a sickness building inside of me\nWho will I really have to answer to\n\nMarch on through the rivers of red\nSouls drift, they fill the air\nForced to fight, behind\nThe crooked cross\n\nFuck what I said earlier about transitions. As soon as Crooked Cross ends, it jumps straight into one of Slayer's greatest songs, Mandatory Suicide. This song is fantastic, with its main riff at once descending and ascending thanks to the dual guitars. Again Lombardo shines on the song, guiding the band through mid-tempo grooves and irregular time signatures as the guitars all too calmly palm mute in the choruses. Araya's vocals are also great - \"feel the heat/BURRRRN!\" - because they are actually mostly restrained, as on the chorus (\"suicide...suicide...\"). After a killer drum fill, the outro of the song contains more double bass drum insanity, haunting guitar effects, and a spoken word monologue.\n\nLying, dying, screaming in pain\nBegging, pleading, bullets drop like rain\nMines explode, pain sheers through your brain\nRadical amputation, this is insane\n\nFly swatter stakes drive through your chest\nSpikes impale you as you're forced off the crest\nSoldier of misfortune\nHunting with bated breath\n\nA vile smell, like tasting death\nDead bodies, dying and wounded\nLitter the city streets\nShattered glass, bits of clothing and human deceit\nDying in terror\nBlood's cheap, it's everywhere\nMandatory suicide, massacre on the front line\n\nKing's love/hate of religion comes to the fore with Read Between the Lies, slamming Televangelists. Araya's vocals are machine gun fire. Whilst the song may be one of my least favourites on the albums, it's still a banger, especially with how energetic it is. The same for the Judas Priest cover, Dissident Aggressor, which is pretty out of place and I welcome it as a detour.\n\nWhy does Kerry King hate Cleanse the Soul? It's awesome, with angular riff work not at all \"happy\", as he once described it. Well, read this lyrics, bro:\n\nBody that rests before me\nWith every dying breath\nSpellbound and gagged\nI commence your flesh to dirt\n\nBody that lay before me\nIn everlasting death\nEntombed in abscess\nTo rot and lie stinking in the earth\n\nSounds like a laugh, dunnit?\n\nLive Undead took a while to grow on me, with its borderline sludgy and lethargic feel and winding/unwinding drum work. It's the doomiest song on the album, and even contains Tom Araya's signature stepped-on-a-LEGO-scream (\"the PAAAAIIIIIN!!!!\"). I love it. I also dig the alternating solos between Hanneman and King, almost a gauntlet to see who can out do the other. On this one, Hanneman comes out on top. \n\nCloser Spill the Blood is another slow-burner, which takes its time to truly develop but gets there. It boasts some of Araya's best vocals, an acoustic guitar (on a Slayer album?), and a killer riff with weird bends and dissonance. Lyrically, it depicts some sort of blood sacrifice. Either that or a deal with the Devil.\n\nI'll show you sights that you would not believe\nExperience pleasures thought unobtained\nAt one with evil that has ruled before\nNow smell the stench of immortality\n\nWhilst the song does not stand out immediately, after repeated listens it does. I love the fact it closes the album in the same doom-laden and creeping way as the opener. A more subtle bookends compared to Reign in Blood.\n\nIn terms of Slayer's legacy, this album has the unfortunate distinction of being sandwiched between their most popular album and their most well-rounded one, that being Seasons in the Abyss, which shows Slayer consciously writing faster material again to balance out the slower stuff. In my opinion, Slayer never made a better overall album than South of Heaven. Coming off the heels of Reign in Blood, though, the album received a more mixed reception, with some complaining about the fact the band slowed down. Maybe in terms of tempo, but certainly not in terms of work ethic and songwriting.\n\nThrash metal rarely gets any better than this. Long live Slayer.\n",
        "\nAt only 29 minutes long, Reign in Blood is perfect proof of quality over quantity. Just because the songs aren't long, doesn't mean the music ain't good, or ain't as amazing as some ploddy plops prog bullshit.\n\nThe production on this album gives Slayer the ability to convey their diabolical thrash through a more accessible lens. I know people shit on Rick Rubin for his modern day production work (looking at you, Revival), but he really did a fantastic job conveying Slayer with far more clarity than their debut and perhaps more than Hell Awaits (which is, by the way, a classic in its own right).\n\nThis album is far more than just Angel of Death, Raining Blood & everything in between. The point of the album is how fast the band can play and how to make the best impression in the shortest time. So, yeah, you get recycled riffs, songs in the same key, and similar lyrical motifs peppered throughout. So what? This is music to be appreciated as a whole, rather than as individual parts. I mean, who honestly listens to Altar of Sacrifice and not listen to its twin song, Jesus Saves? Heathens, that's who.\n\nThe guitar playing on this album is insane. Both Hanneman and King trade off riffs and solos as if in their own battle of Heaven and Hell. These six-stringed instruments are getting obliterated - take Angel of Death alone. That series of solos toward the end of the track is random, atonal, and utterly chaotic. I would not have it any other way. Oh, and, check out the whammy bar rape. Elsewhere, the riffage is suited for slower moments; the opening of Criminally Insane and Postmortem prove that the band can reduce the speed without sacrificing the intensity.\n\nAngel of Death is a masterclass in how to open an album. Tom Araya's scream is arguably the best scream ever, and the proudest \"stepped on a LEGO\" moment I think captured on tape. Lombardo's drumming - that double bass drum onslaught before everything comes back for a final chorus tho!!! - is top notch throughout, and indeed on the whole album, because he keeps momentum going. Angel of Death, in particular, is just going straight for the throat, continuing to slice even when your head is firmly off of your shoulders.\n\nLyrically, you will find more extreme lyrics in metal, whether they be the OTT and tongue in cheek Cannibal Corpse or the offense magnet that is Anal Cunt, but I doubt you'll find anything as dark or as diabolical as the lyrics penned by Hanneman and King. I mean - I know I keep going back to this track - let's be real: Angel of Death is the most graphic depiction of the Holocaust and the heinous experiments by Josef Mengele. Oh, and another thing, it's from the perspective of the bad guys. Read this:\n\nAuschwitz, the meaning of pain\nThe way that I want you to die\nSlow death, immense decay\nShowers that cleanse you of your life\n\nForced in like cattle you run\nStripped of your life's worth\nHuman mice, for the angel of death\nFour hundred thousand more to die\n\n...\n\nMillions laid out in their\nCrowded tombs\nSickening ways to achieve\nThe holocaust\n\nPathetic harmless victims\nLeft to die\nRancid angel of death\nFlying free\n\nAnd morality police guardians think that this song advocates the Holocaust? It's pretty obvious that this song comes from a place of interest in the subject matter, but clearly there is no support for it. Then again, the song doesn't outright condemn the Nazis, even if the adjective \"rancid\" gives it away.\n\nThe filler songs so to speak are still amazing. Necrophobic has this really cool hornet swarm sound to it, with Araya's motormouth commanding the proceedings. Then, with Reborn and Epidemic, we get a sort of medieval vibe being brought in. All I can think of is fire, in both the idea of burning the witch in the former song and burning the victims to prevent the spread of disease in the latter. Although a tough act to follow, Piece by Piece picks up where Angel of Death left off by just going for speed.\n\nThe twin pairing of Altar of Sacrifice (a song actually about, you know, sacrificing virgins and even says \"HAIL SATAN!\") and Jesus Saves is actually genius. The former song is probably Kerry King's crowning achievement as a composer, and the opening minute of Jesus Saves is sludgy and slowburning as fuck, before...you guessed it, SPEEEEED! \n\nSpeaking of Jesus Saves, please give a standing ovation to Mr. Tom Araya, not only being a bass player singer but by singing lyrics totally spitting in the face of his Catholic faith. The temptation to refuse to make art due to conflicts of beliefs is there from almost everyone, so for him to actually go along with it and mean it is a feat in and of itself. I'm sure he said four hundred thousand Hail Mary's after vomiting this out:\n\nYou go to the church, you kiss the cross\nYou will be saved at any cost\nYou have your own reality\nChristianity\n\nYou spend your life just kissing ass\nA trait that's grown as time has passed\nYou think the world will end today\nYou praise the Lord, it's all you say\n\nYeah, this reads like an edgy 14 year old atheist. It's become a King staple to just lambast Christianity for the fuck of it. However, divorced from the purpose of the song - to piss off Christians - the guy does have a point. It's just that it's difficult to make out when Araya is trying to keep up with the onslaught of blast beats and crushing guitars.\n\nRaining Blood is overplayed for a reason: it is a fucking masterpiece. After the end of Postmortem, another winner for my money thanks to its kickass riff, we get rain falling. Then, thudding drums, and feedback. The guitars enter - DUN DUN DUN - and then the album closer is set loose. The verses are almost the nail in the coffin, going as fast as anywhere on the album. The lyrics, too, are of resolution, a literal mutiny in Heaven.\n\nTrapped in purgatory\nA lifeless object, alive\nAwaiting reprisal\nDeath will be their acquiescence\n\nThe sky is turning red\nReturn to power draws near\nFall into me, the sky's crimson tears\nAbolish the rules made of stone\n\n...\n\nRaining blood\nFrom a lacerated sky\nBleeding its horror\nCreating my structure now I shall reign in blood\n\nA sole guitar, and then - I shit you not, this is actually credited on the album - noise comes flooding through. The drums are going faster than before, the bass is totally buried, the whammy bars are being ripped out of their bridges. It's rising! It's going! IT'S GONNA-\n\n*clap of thunder and rain for fifty seconds*\n\nIt's actually taken me longer to write this review than the album itself. I suppose I should take a leaf out of Slayer's book and use more brevity.\n\nI am unsure if this or South of Heaven is my favourite Slayer album. Whilst RiB thrives on speed, SoH is a much more doom-laden, atmospheric album. Either way, I love this album and it is an absolute classic, deserving of all of its accolades. May you forever reign, my dark and twisted friend.\n",
        "\nSo I am reviewing a Slayer album, more specifically South of Heaven. Why am I reviewing it? Because this album is one of Slayer's three definitive classics along with predecessor Reign in Blood and Seasons in the Abyss. And with Slayer disbanding soon, it's a good time to reflect on the legacy of this iconic band. We will be talking a lot about how the influence of Black Sabbath plays an important role in the album's sound.\n\nIn 1988, South of Heaven was released by Rick Rubin's label Def Jam and saw a huge change from its predecessor Reign in Blood. Overall, the song tempos were mid paced with some examples of this being two of the album's iconic numbers \"Mandatory Suicide\" and the title track. It is clear that Slayer have taken more influence from Black Sabbath this time around as they display influences from the doom metal pioneering Master of Reality album. The two songs have become live setlist staples since South of Heaven was released. However, it doesn't mean that there was no fast tempo songs on South of Heaven, as tracks like \"Silent Scream\" and \"Ghosts of War\" give the album more variety in the track listing. From my listening experience, the album can be considered a precursor to the groove metal sound that bands like Pantera, Exhorder, and Machine Head were doing in the 90s since they share the thrash metal origins and are influenced by the Sabs.\n\nNow let's talk about my experience listening to it. I didn't like the title track at first, but my co-worker told me the \"South of Heaven\" was his favorite Slayer song made me curious to re-examine my opinion of it. I then listened to the South of Heaven, and I was definitely taken for a ride. The songs I really like are the title track, \"Spill the Blood\", \"Mandatory Suicide\", and \"Ghosts of War\". The title track is a summary of what South of Heaven goes for musically with mid paced tempos and outstanding musicianship, with Dave Lombardo focusing less on fast drumming and more on technicality. \"Spill the Blood\" closes the album and is the song that displays the most Black Sabbath influence on the album with Tom Araya giving a really creepy vocal performance. \"Mandatory Suicide\" is another slower number and displays arguably the best lead work from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman and has a jazzy drum performance that Brann Dailor of Mastodon could be able to pull off. \"Ghosts of War\" is a fast number that opens up the second half of South of Heaven and gave Lombardo a chance to channel a drum performance that is reminiscent of his Reign in Blood performance.\n\nNoticeably, Araya writes lyrics for 60% of the songs which means that most of the songs are about serial killers and death. As expected, King and Hanneman's excellent lead work can be attributed to the songwriting they did. The guitar solos are all among the best solos in Slayer's catalogue focusing less on speed and more on technicality. Speaking of the band's technicality displayed on most of the tracks, Slayer's cover of the Judas Priest classic \"Dissident Aggressor\" (originally on Sin After Sin) works really well with the proto-groove metal style of South of Heaven. Slayer would eventually cover the album's primary influence, Black Sabbath on the Black Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black II in 2000. In my opinion, I even consider the musicianship to be on par with Master of Puppets which is a difficult thing for me to say, but in the end it paid out for the band members.\n\nWith Slayer's farewell tour currently intact, this is the best time to get this review up and running. It's not the best album in Slayer's catalogue but South of Heaven is definitely one of those iconic metal albums that stood the test of time. It's not the fastest Slayer album either, however it will definitely reward listeners with some of the most technical musicianship out there.\n",
        "\nThe 90s were an odd time for \"mainstream\" heavy music here in the States, that much is for sure. I don't need to provide you with the how and why, but needless to say the climate had changed to the point where personal evolution had to be jump started lest one were to be left behind to starve, and no one exemplified this notion quite like our favorite ghouls in Slayer. Although everyone in the Big 4 of thrash morphed into something that only required half of their creative fuel supply (and personally, Megadeth did the best job riding out the storm of the lot), Araya and co. had a bit more piss than vinegar in their personal formula, a slower burning devolution that at least warranted halfway decent listens. At best, and at most, though it was never a perfect situation. Case in point...\n\nSay what you will about post-\"Seasons...\" Slayer, a few of those outputs had an identity, no matter how much one would detest it (\"Diabolus\", for all its greyscale music and downshifted energy, actually felt like an album that had an idea behind it). The same can't be said with this, though...I would have never put the word \"dull\" to describe Slayer or any of their works, but dammit if this isn't one of the dullest thrash albums I'd ever heard. One feels so very little with this...the level of angst, abhorrence and/or disgust accounts to little more than loud apathy, much like the tone of the album in question; just rage for the sake of being loud as opposed to being truly against their intended targets. With all the strength and lasting power of a single, harsh gust of wind, \"Divine Intervention\" flits by the listener like a sloppy hit-and-run, where at its best the tracks provided mainly sound like stale B-sides from the \"Seasons...\" sessions (Killing Fields, Serenity of Murder) and at its worst do their damnedest to get by on extremity alone but are more tunnel-visioned than I'm sure the auteurs intended them to be (Dittohead, Mind Control). Add to that a dry and cardboardy production approach (which gets uglier the more you slog through the album), a by-the-numbers sense of performance and a definitive lack of character, essentially the same tone and bite, track-by-track, and it makes you ponder why the 4 years between \"Seasons...\" and this didn't show much creative growth. \n\nPutting all the blame on Mr. King being the weaker songwriter of the main creative team would be quite mean-spirited (...OK, that's not fair...let's say 80% of it), yet him handling so much of the album's composition leaves the entirety of the work cut from the same set of cloth each and every time as opposed to one track featuring a differing emotional connection and experience; far more \"I'M PISSED OFF!!\" instead of \"I'M PISSED OFF, AND HERE'S WHY!\" But therein also lies one of the few better aspects \"Divine...\" contains; every once and again, when cooks with more elements to their recipe enter the fold and add to the creative broth, you get songs like the diabolical title track and the absolutely haunting \"213\", thereby showing 90s Slayer at their most dark and soul-devouring. This in itself ensures the album isn't as complete a misfire as the more lackluster tracks almost pushes it to be, brief glimpses of proof that the evil and visionary spirit the group once had in the 80s was still in there somewhere amidst the feast of bland white bread that is the rest of the album. In fact, this reviewer found them to be the longest lasting and most important tracks out of the lot; the ones that actually evoke a reaction in the listener versus fly-by-wire slaps to the face with nothing else beyond that point, and if everything else was just as impactful and, dare I say, important, then we wouldn't be so dulled by a lack of stylistic identity. But alas, that was not to be.\n\nIn the end, \"Divine Intervention\" showcases a band running out of steam while attempting to conform to an era that didn't want them (I would honestly consider this their lowest point until the drivel that was \"Repentless\" came at us), yet with enough in them to craft at least a few pieces that made us believe the Slayer of old was still in there, someplace.\n",
        "\nOk, so this one's the infamous Slayer's \"nu-metal oriented\" album. Yes, I said nu metal. The influences the band took from bands like Slipknot and Chimaira are evident here. The guitars are downtuned, depending on the song, from C# standard tuning to Drop B tuning, the riffs are groovier, quite nu-metal inspired (the track \"Threshold\" sounding completely like an actual nu metal song), there are quite a lot of breakdowns, the guitars sound compressed and quite polished. It's something definitely different from what they did till \"Divine Intervention\", but is it really that bad?\n\nThe answer is: no. First of all, the album is definitely an improvement from its predecessor \"Diabolus In Musica\". There's really some memorable material here, yeah, there are even a few lesser tracks, but the level of the songs maintains at least decent for the entire duration of the album. The guitar work, although not being the thrash fest the band had accustomed us to with its most legendary releases, is good. There are some really cool riffs scattered here and there; on the other hand, the solos could have been a bit better, as they mainly rely on the wah-wah pedal effect and they aren't that special, save a couple of exceptions. The bass, on the other hand, is almost inaudible for most of the duration of the album.\n\nTom Araya's vocals are consistent, his performance is solid, although he goes a bit over the top on some occasions (see the scream at the beginning of \"Seven Faces\"). Spot on his ability to sing complex, breathtaking vocal lines, as in \"Disciple\" and \"Payback\", songs that require a good breathing technique to be sung correctly. Paul Bostaph's drumming is really amazing to be honest, his style is quite different from Lombardo's, but he's so technical, precise, fast, and his fills fit the song so well, that I really didn't miss the band's original drummer on this release. The lyrical department is well-studied, especially the tracks dealing with the themes of religion have interesting lyrics. \n\nSpeaking of the songs, there are some that aren't so special, but also some that have become real classics on this CD: album opener \"Disciple\" is a must-play at every Slayer show, thanks to the cool main riff, the catchy vocal part and chorus, the various climaxes in the song's structure, the breakdown, and memorable lines like \"God hates us all!\" or \"I'll never be the one to bear the cross, disciple!\". \"God Send Death\", \"New Faith\", and \"Bloodline\" are all bangers, with evil sounding riffs and vocals; the latter's particularly aggressive thanks to its mid-tempo structure and the heavy breakdown. Another awesome track, beloved by fans (the band even threw it in the farewell tour's setlist) is \"Payback\", the song with the lowest tuning in the entire album (Drop B): it's a fast tempo composition, energetic, extremely ferocious, driven by an amazing main riff and some cool tremolo picking sections, for example in the pre-chorus. The lyrics are something that will really make your blood pump in your veins, they talk about a story of revenge: \"I'm going to tear your f*cking eyes out, rip your f*cking flesh off, beat you till you're just a f*cking lifeless carcass!...\" and so on. Brutal indeed.\n\nWell, \"God Hates Us All\" isn't one of Slayer's best efforts to date, but it's also not one of the worst, it's just a decent effort where the band tried to experiment a bit and change its sound, but it's unfair to cast stones at this album just because it took influences from a genre not popular on this site.\n",
        "\nOne of the few things I don\u2019t think gets said a lot about Reign in Blood and, even after its release some thirty-two years ago, is its finesse. I mean, what with all the talk of its supreme extremity another point that\u2019s certainly worthy of note is how it upped the game in terms of what could be achieved in terms of professionalism and applying that trait to austere, menacing brutality. Simply put, if Pleasure to Kill is a sixteen-year-old running rampant with a kitchen knife in ALDI, then Reign in Blood, in terms of extended metaphor and murder, is the SS or the NKVD; callous, malicious and even more harrowing due to its cold efficiency. \n\nThe first two Slayer albums \u2013 obviously eternal classics \u2013 were still embiggened with the spectre of 80\u2019s excess. This was not a fault (far from it!); glorious twin-leads, evil outbreaks of Venom-esque metal on Show No Mercy and an accidental discovery of death metal on Hell Awaits will always be the stuff of legend. Here, however, Slayer managed to rein (ha!) in that excess to create Slayer through a hardcore lens. Hell, while we can continue comparing this to Darkness Descends and Seven Churches (with the obvious caveat that Dark Angel were never even fit to polish Slayer\u2019s oversized spikey armbands) and start talking more about Age of Quarrel and Minor Threat. \n\nHowever, while that hardcore edge permeates this album, it is really just as Mercyful Fate as it is Minor Threat. While Jeff Hanneman and Dave Lombardo were responsible for the punk-ish sound here, it is clear that Kerry King was still a metal kid. \u2018Altar of Sacrifice\u2019 is his crowning glory as a songwriter and an incredibly important part of Reign in Blood\u2019s glory. It answers the question: \u201cHow would Mercyful Fate\u2019s \u2018Gypsy\u2019 and Show No Mercy riffs sound if they were played with RiB impossible brutality?\u201d The next time someone calls him a tribal tattoo-sporting baldy, remind them of his former glory and perhaps they\u2019ll reconsider. \n\nOf course, if that is King\u2019s crowning moment then \u2018Angel of Death\u2019 is Jeff Hanneman\u2019s most important track. Not only is it just as frightening as it was when I first heard it some fifteen years ago, it\u2019s lyrically quite unlike anything else in the metal canon. The riffs and drums are, of course, veritable hellstorms \u2013 set to crush the earth, but the lyrics are just unusual. Obviously, anyone with a reading age over seven could recognise that this is not a song venerating the holocaust, and yet, unlike every other thrash song on the topic, it does not need to assert a moralising message. The depiction itself is horrid enough. Jeff Hanneman was just so far beyond any other thrash songwriter of his time. Compare him to Scott Ian and it\u2019s like putting Nathaniel Hawthorne\u2019s petty Christian allegory up against Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s unrestrained gothic. \u2018Angel of Death\u2019 still reigns supreme and goes to show Slayer\u2019s uncanny finesse. Hanneman\u2019s writing manages to convey \u2013 through music \u2013 the worst horrors mankind inflicted on each other and, for that alone, it\u2019s easy to see why he\u2019s still a controversial figure. Again, whereas Hell Awaits might have reeked of teenage thesaurus abuse, here the writing is controlled and really without parallel. The slightly goofy descriptions are gone \u2013 isn\u2019t \u2018Captor of Sin\u2019 about eating a dodgy curry? \u2013 and replaced with metal\u2019s ultimate expression of the macabre. \n\nOf course, this is also Araya\u2019s pinnacle; he maintains all the right aggression and yet is still incredibly articulate. Any death metal style cover of these songs would certainly lack Araya\u2019s incredible diction and stress. He makes every fucking syllable matter and, given how important the lyrics are here, he paints each song with subtle hues of red and grey. Simply put: he\u2019s perfect.\n\nLombardo was, and probably still is, the finest musician to grace a thrash metal album. His drumming is simultaneously austere and yet strangely complex. Like Bill Ward before him, he orchestrates these songs; driving exactly when he should and laying slightly behind whenever these songs need to breathe. It won\u2019t be described as technical because he\u2019s just too damn good for that, his work however is a veritable master-class delivered with bone-crushing precision. Generally, he gets compared to fast drummers who have perhaps exceeded him in terms of speed (Pete Sandoval might be one, but he really lacks Lombardo\u2019s inventiveness and panache when it comes to cymbal and tom work). Again, there was really no equivalent to this still of drumming in 1986; Gene Hoglan sounds like a dog chasing a stick in comparison. \n\nMan, what\u2019s with that vile-hearted laughter on \u2018Criminally Insane\u2019? I\u2019d never really heard it before. I think that\u2019s indicative of the record as a whole, really. Even after all these years, it\u2019s still surprising in its absolute darkness and horror. If you find some quarrelsome points with this record, I can only say your musical education is vastly different from mine.\n",
        "\nDiabolus in Musica was the beginning of the bad times for Slayer. God Hates Us All kept the plague around. Christ Illusion almost got us there, but not quite... and at long last, just when we thought it was time to wave the thrash gods goodbye, they came around in 2009 and punched us all in the collective jaws with this collection of aggressive madness. World Painted Blood earns praise from Slayer fans as being some of their finest work since 1990\u2019s Seasons in the Abyss, and after giving the album a few listens it isn\u2019t hard to see why. The album is superb, it just is. It\u2019s atmospheric, it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s angry, and it just has the irreplaceable feel of classic Slayer that we\u2019ve all come to know and love.\n\nThe album returns to my beloved half-step-down Eb/D# tuning (with the exception, I believe, of \u201cNot of This God\u201d), amps the production and guitar tone back up, and just comes back full force with more spectacular riffing and crazy leads that I\u2019ve been waiting so long to hear again. Every track feels crisp and clean to me, with every note, every percussion hit, and every word from Araya perfectly audible and precise.\n\nSpeaking of Tom Araya, the vocal quality is back on this album. On their last record, Araya\u2019s vocals sounded tired and bored, residing solely in the lower register and never going for the loud and abrasive shouting he\u2019s capable of. On this album, though, Araya\u2019s vocals are full of energy and aggression, not to mention use of the higher register and even some surprisingly high screams like on the tracks \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d and \u201cBeauty Through Order\u201d. Not \u201880s-Slayer high or anything, but extremely refreshing to see that in his old age he can still deliver an extremely powerful vocal performance reminiscent of the band in their prime.\n\nOf course, as much as I love WPB, no album is perfect, not even from our almighty Slayer. Some songs, as before, have the classic trademark of bad Kerry King lyricism, most notably on the track \u201cAmericon\u201d, where we hear such lyrical gems as \u201cIt\u2019s all about the motherfucking oil/Regardless of the flag upon its soil\u201d. Come on, Kerry, that\u2019s just shameful. We also have some rather forgettable filler, like on the absolute snoozer \u201cSnuff\u201d or the OTHER (worse) slow, haunting track on the album, \u201cPlaying With Dolls\u201d, which drags on far longer than it should and doesn\u2019t really have much to offer in the way of riffing... or leads... or lyrics... or vocal delivery.\n\nOtherwise, though, this album is their true, TRUE return to form, and probably their best album of the four they\u2019ve released since the turn of the century. Back to thrashing, back to good lyrics and riffing, and just back to classic, no-nonsense Slayer. The album has its duds - every album does - but pads the rest of its time with strong songs that it more than makes up for whatever dead time there is. If you ever listen to a modern Slayer album, let it be this one, and you won\u2019t be disappointed, I promise you that.\n",
        "\nGHUA wasn't a comeback from the nu-metal days for me, as a surprising amount of people tend to claim. So, naturally, if one album isn't a band's comeback, surely their next record would be, right? As it turns out, that is depressingly not the case for our friend Christ Illusion, here, an album that once again left me scratching my head wondering what happened to my favorite thrash band.\n\nOf course, coming hot off the trails of GHUA, this album is a markable improvement by some metric. We finally see a return to D# standard tuning for some pretty nice cuts like \"Jihad\", the return of some proper thrashers like the aforementioned track as well as \"Flesh Storm\" and \"Catalyst\", and even a surprisingly good slow and heavy track in the form of \"Eyes of the Insane\". However, this album is severely limited by its continuation of the things that held Slayer back on their last release, namely Kerry King's remarkably edgy and cringey lyrical stylings combined with muddy, downtuned, forgettable guitar work like on cuts such as \"Skeleton Christ\" or \"Cult\".\n\nWe also have some weird production kinks that I don't necessarily know what to pinpoint, but just feel... awkward. After a few repeated slogs through the muddy waters of this album, the errors in the songs and the weird quirks of each track stuck out to me more and more. Odd solo work, strange vocal delivery, drum work that I didn't enjoy, things of that nature. In addition to things that feel awkward to me, I can't shake how much I dislike Kerry King's lyric writing on this album in particular. It was bad on GHUA, but at least he had SOME range of topics, even if that range was just from \"I hate you\" to \"I hate God\". On this album, though, literally entitled Christ Illusion, every lyric he pens is about how God is a stupid bitch and how religion sucks, which he of course accomplishes in the most cringey way he can. Hearing Tom Araya belt out lines like \"I've made my choice: six six six!\", \"Religion's a whore!\", and \"Mind control, fuck compulsory religion\" really just don't sit well with me. I know Kerry King can pen a complex and layered song, too, so hearing him result to the valley of \"fuck\" wherever he needs extra syllables and trying to find new uses for the word \"rape\" really just feels especially lame this time around.\n\nOverall, though, I don't hate this album, as it is a marked improvement over their last two projects, and does provide me with a couple tracks that I unironically enjoy listening to. But it showed that Slayer had a ways to go to escape the nu-metal hole they'd dug themselves into, and forgettable filler combined with an awkward listening experience really stopped me from calling this anything close to the comeback people so desperately want to claim it is.\n",
        "\nA lot of fans of Slayer tend to praise this album as their return to form from the 1998 experiment that was Diabolus In Musica, an album that saw Slayer drop their tuning, mud up the mix, and test out whether or not the grass was greener on the other side of the metal fence. And as it turns out, no, no it isn't. But that's a review for another album. The point is, the band made a departure from what they were good at, and every Slayer fan was on their toes leading up to 9/11 (a fitting release date) waiting to see if they would return to their thrash roots. Well, I have to say that it seems that they didn't, and their praised \"return to form\" stinks of nu-metal just as hard as the last album.\n\nWe still don't have a SINGLE song in their classic D# standard tuning, their lyrics still smack of middle school edgelord garbage (thanks, Kerry King), and the guitar work is just as muddy as ever. Tom's vocal stylings are still highly conformant to nu-metal styles, as well, something that's highly evident on the track \"Threshold\", probably the worst song on the album. Right after the first verse, Tom grunts out a couple lines delivered in an eerily Korn-like fashion, which make the song that much harder to suffer through.\n\nThis is the problem with GHUA, in my eyes. The riffwork is faster, yes, but the down-tuned, muddy guitars, the garbage lyrics, and the shameful vocal delivery really seat this album in the same category as Diabolus for me. Not only that, but we don't even have a welcome respite in Slayer's trademark chaotic and brutal guitar solos like we had on their last album, as the solos on this project feel incredibly forced and consist of maybe three or four notes whammied to hell and pushed through some sort of flanger or echo pedal (which is a lot less Slayer-iffic than you would think), where they even exist at all.\n\nOverall, while there are a few good moments on the album, like some cool aggressive riffing or occasional breakdown, the album is incredibly hard to suffer through and feels too much like a more modernized reboot of their last project for me to enjoy it. Sorry, boys, this just wasn't your album.\n",
        "\nSlayer burst into the 1990s exactly the way one would expect: with aggressive speed, murderous lyrics, and an album cover that looks like it was finger-painted by Manson and Bundy. \n\n\u201cSeasons\u201d was a reassuring album and it needed to be, as the climate of metal was changing significantly in the late 80s . The rise of funk and alternative metal had already corrupted a few hallowed artists at this point (Mordred and Death Angel had both begun to flirt with it). Death metal was still a few years away from taking hold internationally. From the very first cut, the punishing double-bass and machine-gun riffing of \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d was a call to arms \u2013 Slayer were back, still the leading titans of metal, and the idea that they would ever release a weak album? Unthinkable! This band was an incorruptible, unstoppable force or, so it seemed at the time. \n\nAs the album plays out, it becomes obvious that the band is truly firing on all cylinders, thrashing cuts like \u201cSpirit in Black\u201d and \u201cBorn of Fire\u201d blasting away with trademark intensity, Hanneman and King trading crazed solos over the speeding din. Even slow burners like the chugging \u201cSkeletons of Society\u201d find the band clearly in their element; riffing simple and effective, Araya belting out verse after twisted verse, the chorus doubled with eerie spoken accompaniment. Sure, \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d sounded like a creepy rewrite of \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d, so what? It\u2019s not like Slayer are running out of ideas! The 6+ minute title track is one of their greatest accomplishments, moving from Sabbathy crawl to clean melody to slashing riff crunch, all executed flawlessly, Lombardo pounding and pattering like a freak of nature. Overall, a collection of strong material, speed and power delivered in abundance. The band is obviously sticking with a winning formula as fans expected. If this lineup had stayed intact, who knows how many more quality releases could have been sustained. \n\nThe Clash of the Titans tour and world domination would continue for the next few years (I\u2019m glad I bit the bullet and paid the outrageous 1991 price of $25 to see the Anthrax, Slayer, Megadeth, and Alice in Chains on the same bill. I almost passed on it!) At any rate, the unsuspecting metal hordes had no idea this was the end of the band\u2019s strongest era.\n",
        "\nSlayer is my favorite thrash metal band. Even if the genre was already coined, it wasn't until the \u201cHaunting the Chapel\u201d EP that things started going extreme in terms of high speed tempos and the dissonant sense of melody. Pioneers putting the devil in music. This live album represents the end of the band's golden age that started with that EP, was recorded shortly after the release of their last \u201cclassic\u201d album and features the original line-up with Jeff on guitars and Dave Lombardo on drums.\n\nLombardo\u2019s revolutionary Latino influence in thrash metal percussion is captured in all it's glory, double bass drums sound absolutely pummeling as well as the intrinsic tum breaks. Tom's voice sounds strained naturally, screaming your guts out every night on tour isn't particularly good for vocal chords but his potency is intact and his attitude undisputed. Bass guitar is present on the mix, like it was in studio offerings before \u201cReign in Blood\u201d were they turned its volume down considerably. When the guitars change leads, the bass fills the gap that rhythm guitar leaves. A crunchy low end is always pleasing in extreme metal. The guitars\u2019 tone is sharp, acid, not that thick but has enough body to add the desired weight to the riffs and of course it's distortion is completely raw and analog. Soloing is accurate and memorable, just like the studio takes. Contrary to Rick Rubin\u2019s superdry trademark studio sound, this mix sounds very organic and the acoustic dynamics from the venue give a delicious, natural, immense reverberation.\n\nThe setlist consist of a compilation of the band's first six releases, balanced this way: 3 songs from the debut album \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d, 2 from \u201cHaunting the Chapel\u201d, the song \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, plus the good half from \u201cReign in Blood\u201d -Jeff\u2019s songs- 2 songs from \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d and 7 songs from \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d, the album they were touring for. This setlist is pretty much what they continued playing live for the rest of their carrier, just a couple of songs from the last album at the moment of the recording feel like fillers in here (Expendable Youth and Spirit in Black) the rest are all classics. Regarding the production quality, you can't hear a lot of crowd noise but the acoustics from an open air festival definitely characterizes the mix a lot. The performance of the band is astonishingly solid, there are normal little errors but that just shows it wasn't edited much. What you can hear is exactly how the gig sounded that day, no studio overdubs.\n\nNow that Jeff is dead and Lombardo left the band in bad terms, this album takes relevance as the only opportunity to hear such an extensive setlist live by the original line-up, the other options are the live tracks from \u201cSoundtrack of the Apocalypse\u201d and \u201cLive Undead\u201d, none of them full shows. I'm taking 2 points away because of the song selection -the couple of fillers- and 1 point because the final master could have been slightly better, for a solid 97. This is the best live album from the most important band of thrash metal.\n",
        "\n\"Show No Mercy\" presents quite a different Slayer than would eventually come to be. Displaying their NWOBHM influences quite prominently, this album presents Slayer at their hungriest, eager to stake out a claim in the metal world.\n\nEven in their earliest stages, Slayer had a kind of aggression that very few could match. On the blazingly fast opener \"Evil Has No Boundaries,\" the band channels their love of Venom and turns it into something altogether darker and more sinister. There is none of Venom's sleazy charm present as Tom Araya spews forth tales of violence and the occult over Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King's speedy, chugging riffs. This brand of brutality is elsewhere displayed on the pandemonium of the title track, where Araya can barely get his words out fast enough as Dave Lombardo's supercharged, precise drumming pounds the listener. \n\nBut \"Show No Mercy\" is not all Venom worship and 0-0-0-0-0-0 riffs. The band displays their obvious love of the more melodically inclined Iron Maiden and Judas Priest on tracks like \"Crionics\", with it's harmonized bridge and galloping triplet riffs. Other tunes like \"Die By The Sword\" and the ominous, foreboding \"Tormentor\" display the melodic, chunky riffage commonly found in NWOBHM songs, while Araya's vocals range from the high pitched Halfordian shrieks to Cronos' low, sneering growl. The guitar solos aren't the whammy bar abuse commonly found in later Slayer albums, and they are much more \"conventional,\" having more in common with the pentatonic shred of their contemporaries in Metallica.\n\nThe production is fairly raw, but not significantly worse than the average early '80s metal band on an independent label. The bass is pleasantly audible, and a thick layer of reverb hangs over the whole affair. Don't go into this album expecting it to sound very similar to \"Reign in Blood,\" but it's absolutely deserving of the praise it gets as a landmark of early thrash.\n",
        "\nIn my last review, I discussed how much I enjoyed Slayer's classic debut record, \"Show No Mercy\". That was a awesome slab of thrash, but THIS is just on a whole new level! Slayer's follow-up \"Hell Awaits\" certainly raised the bar higher than it could go, with even more Mercyful Fate influence and stronger songwriting. The riffs are more varied, and Tom Araya's vocals are even more dark and sinister than the previous record. In my eyes, this is Slayer's undisputed masterpiece, and one that would never be topped. \n\nThe production is even more grittier and more evil sounding than \"Show No Mercy\". The atmosphere is truly diabolical, very dark and hellish. The guitar tone perfectly captures this imagery, with Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's razor sharp riffs and solos. Tom Araya's bass is audible as audible can be, this is how you mix the bass on a record! His bass lines shine throughout, and they are amazing. Araya has always been one of my favorite thrash bassists. His vocal performance here is the best vocal performance he has ever done on any Slayer record. His vocals resemble that of a tortured soul suffering the most barbaric torture imaginable! Dave Lombardo is amazing as usual, with his lightning fast drumming and creative fills. You also can't forget his remarkable double bass! \n\nAs for the record itself, the opening begins the whole listening experience with some of the most demonic voices played backwards. These voices if played backwards continue to repeat \"Join us\". Then, a voice resembling that of Satan himself proclaims \"WELCOME BACK\". The chaotic riffing of \"Hell Awaits\" soon follows, and Araya's barks out the vocals with rapid fire intensity. The title track is truly a classic, easily in the top 5 Slayer tracks of all time. The voice that growls \"HELL AWAITS\" is quite possibly the beginnings of death metal. \n\nMy favorite track on this record however is the creepy \"At Dawn They Sleep\" which is about vampires, this song from what I can recall is Dave Lombardo's personal favorite Slayer song. The opening is as creepy as creepy gets. The haunting melody then leads into amazing riffs, and this section of the song is quite possibly the best example of Araya's bass talents. The solos on this track in particular are the best solos Hanneman and King have ever done. This track is essential listening. \"Necrophiliac\" has some incredible riffs, especially during the opening. I have always thought this track was a precursor to \"Necrophobic\" from \"Reign In Blood\". Anyways, this is a awesome track too!\n\nThis record is by far Slayer's most ambitious and progressive. I really wish Slayer did more albums like this, because this easily blows away any of their later stuff with maybe the exception of \"Reign In Blood\". The song structures are complex, the riffs are heavy, the solos are varied and aren't just whammy bar wankery, the bass is audible, the Araya's vocals are at their peak, and Lombardo's drumming is on point. These 7 tracks will drag you through the fiery depths of hell, I highly recommend this to fans of Venom, Mercyful Fate, Exodus, Dark Angel, and Exumer.\n\nHighlights: EVERYTHING!\n",
        "\nSo this is what people proclaim as being \"the greatest thrash metal album of all time?\" Like, I can see why but to call this the best would be a stretch. However, it is certainly a great, great record. The extreme tempos and riffs are breathtaking, as well as Araya's vocals and Lombardo's drumming. Slayer's 3rd effort \"Reign In Blood\" certainly changed the landscape of thrash as we know it, but unfortunately gets way too much credit than it deserves. The reason this is a bad thing is because people often get misled into thinking this is truly \"the greatest\", but the truth of the matter is that there is tons more out there that push the limits further. The production is too clean, and the gritty nature of the previous two records isn't present here. So is it bad by any means? Well, not at all. This record is certainly worthy of some praise, but I personally wouldn't rank this in my top 20 favorite thrash records of all time. I know I sound like I'm harshly bashing on this record, so let's focus on the positives...\n\n\"Angel Of Death\" is a absolute classic thrash song. It has fast riffs, intense vocals, chaotic solos, and fast double bass drumming. The scream at the beginning of the track from Tom Araya is without a doubt the most iconic scream in thrash metal history. This track was written about Jeff Hanneman's fascination about the history of Auschwitz, and the lyrics describe the immense amount of torture that happened there. This track is probably Slayer's most iconic track, and is certainly the best on the entire album. \"Jesus Saves\" is one of the more underrated tracks on this album. The fast riffs of Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are pure insanity, and the vocals from Araya are intense to say the least. This track deserves more attention than it gets. \"Postmortem\" has a badass opening riff, which leads into a heavy mid-paced riff that is bound to make you bang your head. This track is calm before the storm however, because what follows is fucking insane...\n\nThe sound of rain, thunder and eerie guitar sounds resembling faint, distant screams suddenly meet the listener's ears. Then, suddenly one of the most instantly memorable riffs comes in and the rest is history. Yup, I am talking about the closing track \"Raining Blood\". This thrash anthem has some of the most intense riffs imaginable, but to be honest I never really was crazy about the whammy bar abuse at the end. After the solos end, a loud clap of thunder followed by rain fades out and ends the record. 29 minutes of complete, utter mayhem has ended.\n\nIf you know thrash, then you have heard this record. If you haven't by some chance, then you must be living under a rock just like Patrick Star from Spongebob Squarepants. This record isn't the best thrash album of all time, so don't go in thinking it's going to be the greatest thing you've ever heard. However, do expect to hear some chaotic music and 10 tracks that resemble the 10 corners of hell. I recommend this to fans of Exodus, Exumer, Dark Angel, Morbid Saint, Sadus, and Demolition Hammer.\n\nHighlights: \"Angel Of Death\", \"Jesus Saves\", \"Postmortem\", and \"Raining Blood\"\n",
        "\nSSSLLLAAYYYERRR!!!\n\nThat is all you need to hear, and you know exactly what one is talking about. Slayer are one of thrash metal's most iconic acts, with a career spanning almost 40 years! As you all may have heard however, Slayer have announced a farewell tour, so I thought this would be the time to review some Slayer. Slayer's debut, \"Show No Mercy\" is quite possibly their most primitive record. Recorded and released all the way back in good old 1983, this record showcases thrash in it's early days. The band's love for Venom and Iron Maiden can clearly be heard, with some fast and vicious guitar riffs courtesy of guitar duo Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, demonic vocals from Tom Araya, and fast drumming from Dave Lombardo. Slayer's debut is one of the pioneering thrash records, and would go on to become the best-selling debut album released by any Metal Blade act in history. \n\nThe production is very good for 1983 standards, it has that unhinged, evil, sinister sound to it. Tom Araya funded the album's recording using his earnings from being a respiratory therapist, and Kerry King also helped fund the recording by borrowing money from his father. Brian Slagel did a great job producing the record, this type of production certainly helped make this a one-of-kind Slayer album. \n\nThe opening track \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" has some great riffs, and the gang shouts of \"EVIL!\" include none other than the \"Atomic Clock\" Gene Hoglan. This is a great opener. The following track \"The Antichrist\" is easily in my top ten favorite Slayer songs. The main riff is truly evil sounding, and the solo is kickass! The way Araya shrieks \"ROT!!!\" is blood-curdling. \"Die By The Sword\" is another one of my favorite Slayer tracks. Araya's vocal performance on this particular track is the best vocal performance of the album. \"Black Magic\" is the best song on the whole record, the riffs are superb, Jeff Hanneman is a genius (R.I.P.). This track in particular never gets old, no matter how many times I've heard it before. Lastly, I'd like to mention \"Crionics\" which is personally in my opinion, the most underrated track on the record. The melodic section in the middle is in stark contrast to most of Slayer's riffs that appear throughout their later works. I love the solos that overlay over the main harmony, it sounds excellent. Overall, there are no filler, just all killer!\n\nSlayer's debut is quite underrated when you compare it to their other records which seem to gather more praise such as \"Reign In Blood\" and \"Seasons In The Abyss\". Their earlier material is all that I like by them. When Lombardo left, they started to go downhill. To me, Hanneman's passing marked the end of Slayer as we knew them. I think most Slayer fans can agree, no Hanneman, no Slayer. Anyways, they have proved themselves as legends with this record, \"Hell Awaits\" and \"Reign In Blood\". I recommend this to fans of Venom, Iron Maiden, Mercyful Fate, and Judas Priest. \n\nHighlights: \"The Antichrist\", \"Die By The Sword\", \"Black Magic\" and \"Crionics\"\n",
        "\nAhh, yes the only Slayer EP I'll ever bother to review. How has this thing been going? Good I take it since Chemical Warfare was on Slayer's live set list in the October of 2016. Definitely has made a mark with the fan base, more so than Serenity of Murder and Stain of Mind, the former having no bragging rights besides the iconic cover of an overly obsessed fan that carved Slayer in his back and former having no cry to fame at all.\n\nIn comparison though, Haunting the Chapel also actually exclusive songs that can only be found here, not a single from an at the time upcoming album with a cluster of live tracks with half of said live tracks already having a superior live performance available on Decade of Aggression. My point being this is the only Slayer EP that wasn't a promotional cash grab that faded into a level of obscurity over the course of time, and now that that's been said there's not much more to gush on about besides the actual musical content itself.\n\nDo you like riffs? Do you like fast aggressive riffs paired with shredding solos, quick double pedal drum work and shouted vocals? Could I ask a more rhetorical question than that? Find out next week on Dragonball Z. Pardon the sarcasm but that's about what you need to know about it musically, its fast, its hard and its everything you might expect from Slayer minus a some screechy squeals on the guitar solos. If you have one of the album's remasters on hand you'll also find a longer run time with the addition of Aggressive Perfector, which is a welcome addition that matches the EP musically and helps bump it out to a preferable length. I guarantee if you want a hard copy that a newer copy will be worth having unless you really just must have an original printing.\n\nNow the recording quality of course could be better, the bass for one needs to be louder in the mix, I can barely make it out. The riffs are fast and heavy but dampened under the recording quality for a marginally worse sound than they deserve and Tom's shouts are perhaps a bit too loud, none of the EPs issues are musical, they're all purely in production and I've heard at least Chemical Warfare live to say that this stuff throws down fucking hard if given the right kind of love.\n",
        "\nYeah, I get that there's not too much point putting forward yet another opinion on Reign in Blood. It's possibly the only- the only- metal album where you can proclaim \"if you don't like it, you are a false\" with complete and total confidence, and that's been the consensus for decades, and for good reason, too. Mostly, I just wanted to rant/rave/ramble about the historical context of this album.\n\nBack when i was 13 (I think?) I bought Metallica's I Disappear. It was the heaviest shit in the world to me at the time.. yeah I know. Anyway, my grandad, in his mid 70's at that point, was in the house when I turned it on and he absolutely couldn't handle it. Totally hated it! Thought it was complete, incomprehensible noise.\n\nI relay that relatively boring anecdote to put this record into context. If a tune as inoffensive as I Disappear could still annoy people at the turn of this century, well damn, imagine how ridiculous this would've sounded. 15 years earlier! It would've been the fucking apocalypse. It would have just been the most nuts thing ever. There was just nothing anywhere near remotely close to this in the mainstream. \n\nAnd really that's the cool thing about this record- 32 years later, a time when most records one way or another have surely sunk into respectability, into tameness- this album still roasts you if you get too close. My mum, when she's in a good mood, will tap her foot easily enough to Master of Puppets. There is absolutely no chance of the same thing happening with Piece by Piece, or Necrophobic or so on. The wife, who happily handles most of the stuff I put on in the car, has specifically banned me from playing Criminally Insane when I'm in traffic; \"It really stresses me out and I'm always worried you're going to kill someone\". You won't hear anything on Reign in Blood used for a TV advert, you won't hear it in a gym, you won't hear it anywhere. Well, maybe you do in Finland, but I doubt it. But yeah, 3 decades later, this is still far, far heavier than what most of the Australian public will tolerate. \n\nI think the main thing that makes this album such a heavy, full on album even to this day are all those super quick middle tracks. They deserve all the love you can give them. Sure, Angel of Death is a cool song, and the bit when the drums switch from the snare on the 1&3 to the snare on the 2&4 (at 0:30) is, in my mind, almost as cool as that big ol' Araya scream. It's a very cool song, but it's nowhere near as frantic as Reborn's completely out of breath delivery, nowhere near as bonkers as the ridiculous drumming and tempo of Necrophobic, and it's not as huge as Criminally insane's breakdown, it's not as dark as Altar of Sacrifice's monolithic main riff. It attests to the manical intensity of the album when something like Epidemic is basically the \"fun thrasher\" of the album. Most other thrash bands that'd be the most intense tune of the album. Here, it's basically a nice upbeat break after the previous seven tracks. It's all jovial and shit! Gross\n\nYeah, I know I've repeated myself a few times here: frantic/bonkers tempo/maniacal intensity etc. But that's why this album still stands up. It's the most important part of the album! The riffs are undeniably very, very well written- consistently catchy, very heavy, a nice amount of variation, despite the limitations of the short song/fast tempo mix- but this still stands up, this is still very unfriendly etc because everything goes at 100% all the time- the polka-on-meth drums, the razor sharp guitars, Araya's vocals. There's nothing here for the average Joe to grip onto, nothing that's remotely stadium. Just remorseless speed and energy. It's pretty much still the most intense record I've ever heard and it's almost like I still haven't gotten used to it; it's like it gets faster every time I hear it.\n\nAnyway, I'm fairly sure anyone reading this already has a copy, but if you're one of the few that haven't- go and get it! It's a stone cold classic for a whole bunch of obvious reasons.\n",
        "\nSometimes it\u2019s not about dissecting an album song by song, riff by riff, verse by verse, bridge by bridge and chorus by chorus. Sometimes it\u2019s more about the general impression an album leaves on the listener. That holds true especially for homogeneous efforts that mostly stick to one formula, offer little in terms of variation from one song to the next and are often rather short on total running time. Slayer\u2019s World Painted Blood is such an album. Now, if you don\u2019t yet own any Slayer albums, why exactly should you turn to World Painted Blood to become better acquainted with this legendary fearsome foursome? The answer is that you probably shouldn\u2019t. Everything Slayer do on World Painted Blood, they did just as well or even better during their classic period. On the other hand, if you know every classic Slayer output by heart and are looking for something in the same vein, you will find that World Painted Blood comes closer to that particular sound than anything the band put out in 15 years prior. Which, in itself, is quite an accomplishment and enough to make this a highly enjoyable affair.\n\nAfter all, it\u2019s not like Slayer haven\u2019t tried their hand at some \u2013 albeit moderate \u2013 innovation over the years, resulting in, as we all know, a couple of rather lukewarm efforts that were skeptically received by the metal community (Diabolus in Musica, God Hates Us All). So, what\u2019s wrong with refraining from any sort of experimentation for a change and busting out some old-school, no-frills Slayer material? It\u2019s true Slayer had attempted to do just that on their preceding album Christ Illusion, with somewhat mixed results. But where Christ Illusion still retained remnants of the more groove-laden, \"nu\" sound introduced on Diabolus in Musica and continued, though to a lesser degree, on God Hated Us All, World Painted Blood does a much more convincing and consistent job of getting rid of those influences altogether.\n\nNow, if you\u2019d absolutely insist on nitpicking, you might detect some faint residuals of that sound in parts of \"Beauty Through Order\", \"Human Strain\" and \"Americon\", but even those tracks are made up of mostly fast, thrashing sections. The rest of World Painted Blood consists of songs that could just as well have been featured on any of the Slayer records up to and including Divine Intervention. From the title track, sporting an intro that\u2019ll take you right back to \"Hell Awaits\", all the way to the closing thrashfest of \"Not of This God\", World Painted Blood treats us to some of Slayer\u2019s speediest and most punishing tunes since the mid 1990s. Tracks like \"Unit 731\", \"Snuff\", \"Hate Worldwide\" or \"Psychopathy Red\", which is Slayer\u2019s ode to the infamous Rostov Ripper and arguably their fastest and most demolishing song since \"Dittohead\", would certainly hold their own on Divine Intervention and even Reign in Blood. Those two albums also happen to be the closest reference points for World Painted Blood as a whole, even though \"Playing with Dolls\", which is more sinister and melodic rather than all-out violent, sounds like a decent but slightly inferior rehash of \"Dead Skin Mask\".\n\nWhile World Painted Blood checks almost all the boxes when it comes to songwriting, instrumental delivery and overall attitude, one area where it sadly falls short is production values. For one, I believe Tom Araya\u2019s voice would have benefited from a little more echo in order to create an even more \"evil\" sound and to mask the fact that his vocal range is not quite what it used to be. He still does a nice job though, delivering the lyrics with plenty of force and aggression. The major problem, however, is that the guitars really suffer from being too low in the mix and featuring a slightly muffled, dull sound that\u2019s sometimes a far cry from what we\u2019re accustomed to on earlier albums. The riffs are definitely there and they\u2019re pretty damn good, it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t achieve their maximum effect.\n\nHow much these production deficiencies ultimately spoil an otherwise very good Slayer album is up to you to decide. As far as I\u2019m concerned, they don\u2019t change my stance that of all the band\u2019s full-length studio releases after 1994, the original lineup\u2019s last hurrah \u2013 Dave Lombardo would once again leave the band and Jeff Hanneman would sadly pass away a couple of years later \u2013 is the most worthy of bearing the proud name Slayer.\n\nChoicest cuts: World Painted Blood, Unit 731, Hate Worldwide, Psychopathy Red\n\nRating: 8.5 out of 10 points\n",
        "\nLegendary, beloved thrash metal kings from California served dark, insane music for years: Since their incenption in 1981 to those dark MTV channel tarnished years of 1990s. The band soldiered on without getting involved with modern humph up to 1998, when they fell, probably due to pressure from their record company or manager, and released the first true modernized album, 'Diabolus in Musica'. While the next album, 2001's 'God Hates Us All', was more brutal, it simply was an empty shell of once all-ravaging band.\n\nMaybe Slayer noticed this, too, because the follow-up 'Christ Illusion' is a return, at least a partial one, to early times of rage and mayhem. I hate the term \"comeback album\". Well, no band can delete their dirty deeds. Most of them old Californian bands that were the first and second waves of thrash metal, turned into something different at some point. Metallica, Megadeth, Death Angel, Forbidden, and the list goes on... Plus Exodus and Testament on lesser extent. I got a strange trait: I can enjoy these steps out of box like no tomorrow, but I never enjoyed 'Diabolus in Musica' or 'God Hates Us All'. I kind of lost my interest after fine 1994 album 'Divine Intervention'.\n\nAnyway, let's get to 'Christ Illusion'. What a nice title the album carries. It's weird to hear Christian Tom Araya sing lines on 'Cult' such as: \"The pestilence is Jesus Christ; There never was a sacrifice; ...; Beware the cult of purity; Infectious imbecility...\" And from 'Skeleton Christ': \"Because you'll never see the second coming; Life's too short to be focused on insanity; I'll take the devil any day; Hail Satan.\" These both were written by guitarist Kerry King, who seems to have different opinions, then. Araya writes about insanity, killers and jihad. Araya's voice is almost like it was back in 1980s; maybe not quite as rabid, and high-pitched screams are missing. He has unique tone. He shouts and uses clean voice. He still packs quite a lot of power.\n\nThinking about the music here, it's a collage of the band's music from 1990s. The sharp guitar tones of King and late Jeff Hanneman are in action here, as is rather unique, organic drumming style of Dave Lombardo. Yes, it was the classic lineup behind this one. The guitars are also more downtuned at times, losing their nastiness and sounding more muddy (e.g. 'Skeleton Christ'). The modern stop-and-go riffing was applied, among familiar machine-gun shred. Warped \"lottery\" soloing is present, of course. 'Flesh Storm' heavily reeks of 'Seasons in the Abyss's (1990) opener 'War Ensemble', 'Catalyst' like something from 'Divine Intervention', and then it's time for groovier pieces akin to 'Diabolus in Musica'.\n\nHowever, the songwriting proves to be stronger than on 'Diabolus...', at least mostly. 'Jihad' features a Rage Against The Machine-y guitar sounds intro, which should have been scrapped. The song gets much better when the fast action begins! Fast is what Slayer handles here better than those mid-paced moments, even though heavy 'Catatonic' proves to be quite a neck-breaker. Its guitar solo has certain 'South of Heaven' era (1988) vibe to it, so the band dug into earlier times, too. 'Confearacy' has some of the best riffs from the band since 'Divine Intervention'; it's so good to notice, that there still was dry powder in these guys. 'Cult' poses that evil guitar melody work, which is not happening much at all in the band's songs. In all, this feels both pleasantly dated and still recurrent.\n\nThe production is what's expected: Dry and raw-ish. The instruments are easily distinguishable. The louder it's played, better it sounds. Slayer's sound never has been my favourite, but those who enjoy it should be happy with this outcome. Distressing, ugly Larry Carroll \"evil Monty Python\" cover art makes anticipated comeback. Shit, it really didn't feel like it was 2006 when this came out!\n\nSlayer sounds nothing but Slayer (minus the appalling intro of 'Jihad'). And this time around the band really did not disappoint. Surely it's insanely hard to contrast this to old classic albums. On its own it is good, but when comparing, it's just okay. However, this shows that old perpetrators can still do it (unlike Sepultura for a prime example).\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nSo if I get this right, by the time bands like Linkin Park, Slipknot and Machine Head became popular, the older metal bands like Slayer, Sepultura and even Kreator and several others went a bit crazy about these new styles called groove and nu metal, and the fact that bands with almost no skilled musicians and extremely predictable and dull songs became extremely famous.\n\nSo already in 1998 Slayer tried to get a piece of the cake with their album Diabolus in Musica, which sounded like a total catastrophe if you keep in mind that this band wrote albums like Show No Mercy, South of Heaven and Seasons in the Abyss. But in 2001 they've totally killed it with God Hates Us All. Slayer just betrayed their own style by replacing anything that was in a way sophisticated and needed more that 3 months of guitar lessons with loudness war production and totally dumb Slipknot style riffs.\n\nWell, you can say, at least Slayer showed the world that when it comes to hard and loud music, they still rule the scene, and I guess if you would have played this album to a Slipknot or Machine Head fan back then, while listening to this, he would have peed in his pants. But I doubt that if it comes to Slayer it just isn't enough to scare off little kiddies and show everyone how to make a savage album simply with beating the shit out of the instruments and setting the record devices to max volume.\n\nWhat annoys me most is that none of these songs has any decent solo. All solos they have here are totally dumb guitar choking noise making where you just ask yourself if that was actually necessary. Sometimes bands just let out solos if they don't know what to play, and I guess even nobody who actually likes this album would have missed these stupid solos.\n\nSo in the end Slayer may have won the battle against the newer metal genres, but the price for this, meaning that they have abandoned everything that makes them the band they are, being good musicians, just was too high. Here you have an album with 43 minutes of mid-age musicians going full retard while ranting about god and religious stuff like Alex Jones does in his show, but from these 43 minutes there is nothing that remained in your ear and you can see no reason to listen to any of these songs again. Exceptions are maximum 5 second long intro passages like the kickass opening riff from Disciple or War Zone. But thanks to Slayer, even these riffs start to suck after these 5 seconds because instead of adding any variety in it, like at least some altered drumming after the 10th repetition of that riff, they just repeat it and repeat it until you either skip the track, or you lost your brain to all of this dullness.\n\nIf you like bands like Slipknot, newer Sepultura, Machine Head or even System of a Down, I'm sure you'll dig this album and will marry it after the 10th listen. But if you have listened to one of the first 5 albums of Slayer, you won't stand any of these songs for longer than about 1 minute without being totally annoyed.\n",
        "\nOf the thrash metal albums released in the '80s, very few have reached such fame as Slayer's 1986 record Reign in Blood. While Metallica's first four albums both breached the mainstream and helped define the genre, Slayer never achieved any commercial success. Despite this, Reign in Blood is widely considered one of the very best thrash albums of all time. I agree.\n\nThis album is a brutal assault on the ears, driven by the band's impressive technical capabilities and lack of musical knowledge. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman thunder away on complex syncopated rhythms on songs like ''Altar of Sacrifice'' and ''Epidemic,'' while slowing down a little on songs like ''Criminally Insane'' and the intro to ''Jesus Saves.'' Dave Lombardo smashes his drums to bits throughout the album, a highlight being the drum break near the end of ''Angel of Death.'' Lombardo is considered the greatest metal drummer, and this song is a perfect example of why. \n\nVocalist and bassist Tom Araya helps give the album its unique sound, from his massive yell to his tortured high-pitched screams. The lyrical content spans everything from Josef Mengele to Hell and Satan to religion, the perfect mixture for the quintessential thrash metal release. The demonic yells and wicked lyrics are accented by chaotic traded guitar solos, which mimic the screams of the dying and the tortured.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid album that should be in every metalhead's collection.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026if you like metal, the heaviest it gets, I wanna hear you fuckin\u2019 scream\u2026\u201d \u2013 Baloff \n\nA Saturday Night Fever theater poster slowly and steadily burns away, possibly set aflame by excessive Jack Daniels fumes seeping from Paul Baloff\u2019s harsh, anti-operatic throatsear while he questions and incites an audience that\u2019s, um, extremely unusual for this joint. Travolta and his now extremely off-white/burnt umber suit smolders to reveal a still shot of Kerry King and that titanic goddamn armband of his. With each of the Exodus frontman\u2019s screams appears a band name in imperial purple that to the world at large has nothing to do with royalty. Royalty, however, is exactly what these bands become, at least in the blackened eyes of the underground metal realm. \n\nManhattan\u2019s Studio 54 - its owners, managers, bartenders, servers, bouncers, dishwashers, coat checkers and regulars \u2013 had to wonder during the show\u2019s throes and no doubt in its aftermath about the thought processes which allowed this horde of heavy metal fans through the doors to terrorize their renowned \u201870s discoth\u00e8que-turned-\u201980s celebrity nightclub. They also realized, quite painfully, this wasn\u2019t ordinary heavy metal as it was widely known, and naturally neither was this mob. This wasn\u2019t Kiss in \u201982, nor was it a thri-way celebration of Ratt invading your privacy, the midnite dynamite of Kix, or how Whitesnake effortlessly slid it in. Not only did the acts of this fateful Wednesday night offer no identities to those outside underground metal\u2019s pentagram-pierced circle, the style(s) of metal championed by band and fan alike was the moon to all but a handful of the world\u2019s inhabitants. \n\nApparently, a disco glitter ball still hung from the ceiling. \n\n\u201c\u2026you guys are fucking awesome\u2026\u201d - Baloff\n\nSomewhere between Eighth Avenue and Broadway on West 54th Street, for probably the first time ever a crowd - largely denim n\u2019 leather-clad elder teenagers to, at most, mid-twenties leather n\u2019 denim-clad adults - congregates on this lovely spring evening as if to attend an ecological symposium, only they\u2019re bent on its destruction rather than preservation. During these still fairly formative years of heavy metal, as well as the even younger toddler days of lesser known, yet more aggressive thrash metal, with t-shirts and patches swearing fealty to Raven, Venom, Slayer, Voivod, and W.A.S.P., this small throng of rogue misfits yelling, hollering and headbangin\u2019 street-side is the epitome of the unapologetic, true-blue, original underground metal masses that knew no bandwagon for any of this crazy shit, and at this date every bent note played during the show was indeed crazy shit. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is on this April night - with the exception of the purposely-zoomed-in-on homeless black guy in the green skullcap who I can only imagine stumbled into this 99% white mess that's going ballistic about something he has zero interest in, but since it's possibly the most exciting thing that's happened to him since the other day when he found that half-full can of lima beans on the side of the road, he decides to make the best of the situation and, well, 'when in Rome', I guess - every single person out there showed up not only to see their band up there playing, but just as much wanted their band to witness them out there raging for them. Fracture this crowd into a gathering of solitary fans and their becomes his/her band, a single relationship that with favoritism often develops into a private bond. For many underground metal fans like these, many of whom were loners directly because of this unorthodox music and the so few people drawn to it, the scene itself evolved into a home for all such bonds, like a haven for best kept secrets, and because these aren\u2019t public bonds that one shares openly and to just anyone, they become lonesome, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the scene to act as building blocks for comradery between strangers who together are both surprised and intrigued to see another person flashing a Manowar or Voivod pin, or are caught marveling at one another\u2019s captivatingly-obscure Tank and Virgin Steele shirts. That\u2019s not to say no one got socked in the eye that night, but I digress. \n\n\u201c\u2026they say the pen is mightier than the sword. I say fuck the pen, \u2018cos you can die by the sword\u2026\u201d - Araya\n\nThe video\u2019s set list, in its unchronological wisdom, is put to exceptional use, initially exposing its knowingly-limited audience to the bands one song at a time and naturally begins with opening act Exodus and with a yarn that introduces \u201cPiranha\u201d which has gradually found comedic infamy over the years, and ends with a cool psychedelically-traumatized solo by Gary Holt, who stands facing his amps in an ending still-shot with picking arm triumphantly raised, then fades into an eruption of Slayer and \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d, which abruptly and awesomely disgorges into existence moments before Slayer's German-helmeted Slatanic Wehrmacht motto marches across the screen. Venom\u2019s sets are a story unto itself, and part of that romantic tale uncovers why the original footage of their leg of this show has never been unearthed. \n\n\u201c\u2026can we say fuck?\u201d \u2013 Cronos\n\nTwo of the three, Venom and Slayer, honor us with interviews, with the former\u2019s nearly eight minute conversation wisely split in two sections. Despite its length and for simple reasons, it\u2019s the more coherent one. With known quiet guy Mantas absent, in the presence of talkative, animated, friendly, funny and good-natured Cronos and Abaddon, the chat rolls by briskly while they fight over a whisky bottle. Fact is Venom didn\u2019t take themselves very seriously despite their anti-Christian reputation and props that went with it. Neither apparently did members of Slayer, who clown around just as much except with four voices instead of two (with Lombardo doing most of the talking when he's not catching flying lunch meat in his mouth) and some endearingly ham-handed editing that cuts it all out of proportion. Regardless, the \u2018views are spread out quite evenly over the video\u2019s course and shouldn\u2019t feel the wrath of the fast-forward button. \n\n\u201c\u2026New York, you\u2019re makin\u2019 California look like shit\u2026\u201d \u2013 Baloff\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the venue itself is small or just the performing area, but as with most space-hindered places the majority of fat bass identity constricts in favor of the mid-range and its treble, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sound is bad. On the contrary, these higher-ranged sonics seem to infuse the music with some slightly greater urgency and possibly even crisps it up a bit. As a whole, I\u2019ve never been dissatisfied with it. \n\n\u201c\u2026alright, this next song, it\u2019s another fast one, but aren\u2019t they all?\u201d - Holt\n\nNow for what's beyond lunch meat. Exodus is first up with \u201cMetal Command\u201d, \u201cExodus\u201d and \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d. The five-piece\u2019s ferocity seems to grow with each song; for any band that\u2019s a vital gift, but for this act it\u2019s only as long as the heavily-reverbed Baloff can keep up, and when his mike isn\u2019t failing, the big lug often lags behind. The other guys know they\u2019re killing it, verified by the twin H\u2019s during a moment of victorious affection* (just as Baloff falters again), meanwhile powerhouse Tom Hunting pounds his ass off during one of their greatest songs, \"Strike of the Beast\". While Bonded by Blood wasn\u2019t even on shelves yet, by the end of their set there\u2019s little doubt unknown Exodus had won over lotsa future metal-clad consumers on the opposite coast. \n\n\u201c\u2026let me hear ya say this one, ahh\u2026\u201d - Araya \n\nEvery thrash band bends a knee to Slayer, as do their fans, the legions of them. While \u201884\u2019s Live Undead is their first official live recording, this is their first official video recording that in my personal history doubles as the initial jaw-dropping time I saw them in action, which was quite awhile before Reign in Blood soaked the planet. Saying the experience merely laid me out is like dismissing a battleship as just a boat, and all of the live video coverage filmed over the years had to compete with (and lose to) how this fiery foursome ravaged every soul in sight on this particular night. \n\nSlayer perform on the razor\u2019s edge of haywire; it\u2019s as if their innate violence overflow valve ruptured and began spewing some new strain of hostility directly into their bloodstream right before the show. Araya\u2019s lungs are diabolic in their disdainful lyrical discharge and are unnervingly forceful while sending several maniacal \u201cAntichrist\u201d screams heavenward. One can actually hear a miniature sonic boom caused by an exploding sound barrier during \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d following the chorus\u2019 refrain and breakdown**. With less than a month\u2019s time in stores, Hell Awaits, their second full-lengther, could only reap the rewards from this show. Slo-moes, purple-ized freeze frames, wavering fire lenses, a skank\u2019s left tit, Tom\u2019s midnight-black mop, a lyric screw-up in \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, Lombardo\u2019s pounding drumwork backdropped by a sweat rag D.R.I. shirt\u2026all these years later I still can\u2019t escape the original chills their set gave me. \n\n\u201c\u2026where the hell am I?\u201d - Cronos\n\nIt\u2019s with the emergence of Venom\u2019s headliner set where things get infamously dubious. Instantly obvious is the bigger stage\u2026the much bigger stage, to fit the dozens of stacked amps no one else had, and extravagance, with way more floodlights flooding this, yes, extravagantly much bigger stage with more psychedelic colors than my imagination had already clothed Holt\u2019s guitar solo in. The sound is polished and voluminous, like a concert hall recording. Well that\u2019s \u2018cos Venom\u2019s portion of the show is replaced with admittedly bewitching concert footage of dramatically tolled-in \u201cWitching Hour\u201d from their \u201982 Live E.P. video, where Mantas body checks amp towers and Cronos tantrums on the floor while the song collapses unto itself around them. It gets better, \u2018cos also clear is that their second and last contribution, \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d, has comparably dissimilar atmosphere, sound and props to \u201cWitching Hour\u201d and the rest of the video. That\u2019s \u2018cos it\u2019s been abducted from \u201884\u2019s The 7th Date of Hell \u2013 Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, another official Venom video, which means the only actual Venom footage from this night captured for this video is the interview. Regardless, story-driven \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d, considered a fan-fave, explodes with pyrotechnical flair before Cronos decimates a ladybug with the moxy to crawl across the stage during their set with his bass. This is after all the type of destructive, chaotic behavior fans of the Newcastle trio know to expect and expect to love. \n\n\u201c\u2026we were in the crowd\u2026no we weren\u2019t, we were on stage, there was people in the crowd. It\u2019s the drugs, Doug\u2026\u201d \u2013 Cronos\n\nIn reality, however, Mantas remained in England sick with chickenpox. Two of his countrymates were drafted in his place, Fist\u2019s Dave Irwin and Avenger\u2019s Les Cheetham, with each learning half of the set list. This factoid means virtually nothing when speaking of this particular show though, \u2018cos while Venom did play that night, their sets weren\u2019t recorded. It seems the agreement to pay the band prior to recording went south, a direction that was soon followed by the video team\u2019s production cables, which mysteriously fell victim to a Venom-wielded fire axe before the headliner took the stage. To make things right, Neat Records compensated the video company with these pre-recorded clips. \n\nAfter the \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d milieu during the closing credits (fairly prophetic now, for even Studio 54's disco-licking boundary proved ineffective in suppressing Slayer's brand of evil), a gravel-voiced drill sergeant of the Combat army calling himself Major Mayhem promotes some of the label\u2019s available recordings, and even this is kinda sideways cool. \n\nWith adequate camerawork, a coherently chaotic sound and sometimes interestingly distracted, almost free-form style of editing which is perfect for this music\u2019s imperfect primal force, The Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge is, well, simply a great video, even deficit headliner stage footage, and the assorted crowd shots (needed more, especially during band sets) make people either laugh or cry. Sure, it would\u2019ve been nifty to see Venom in the same context as their openers, but what are ya gonna do? \n\nSomehow this video has eluded every bounty hunter dedicated to DVD transference and remains a VHS fossil. Also puzzling is how this hasn\u2019t been reviewed for this site until now. More puzzling is why it\u2019s taken me like twelve years to get to it. \n\n\u201c\u2026we love ya\u2026we\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d \u2013 Baloff \n\u201c\u2026lemme hear ya!\" - Araya\n\u201c\u2026die hard!\u201d \u2013 Cronos \n\nFun fact #ky0i5\u2019: during one of the dates, Tom Araya drunkenly boards Venom\u2019s tour bus and decides Cronos\u2019 hair is a nifty place to take a whiz. Cronos socks him in the eye, sober hands shake the next day, and is the reason the Slayer bassist has a bit of a black eye in the video. From Dave Lombardo\u2019s mouth to my ear. \n\nFun fact F: Venom is one of the few bands to have headlined shows over both Metallica and Slayer (and possibly the other half of the Big 4). A friend of mine has/had this poster when we were in high school. I told him never to get rid of it. Wonder if he listened. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/251146116700159250.\n\n* (30:04 - paragraph eight)\n** (44:22 - paragraph ten)\n",
        "\n\"They say the pen is mightier than the sword, but I say fuck the pen, because you're gonna die by the sword!\"\n\nSome may not consider this to be a true \"live record\" since it was technically done in a small studio-like setting in front of, what, fifty people? But to me, if there's a crowd, then it's live! Though its a very short and simple EP, I can really get behind it due to the fact that it's when Tom and co. were so young, and the performance of such early songs is pretty much the best you'll ever find. You will find no other recording of Slayer doing \"Black Magic\" or \"Aggressive Perfector\" played live that's pulled off any better than this; which makes sense though. I wouldn't really expect anybody over thirty to be able to belt out the screams the way that Tom does on this record. There's also something about the guitars on here that seems to be a little more true to writing intent. Perhaps that the young King and Hanneman hadn't experimented beyond this sound yet, and the ability to play this way had not yet dissolved into the cleaner styles that would arise later. Listen to \"Die By The Sword\" off of Decade Of Aggression and see how it stacks up with this. Not nearly as great, right?\n\nOn another note, Lombardo's drumming shines through very brightly on this, drawing out a heavier and more intimidating sound. Seeing that he is my favorite drummer of all time, that's a pretty remarkable factor for this small set. In general though, I can really dig the way that this raunchy set was pulled off in a manner that's easily accessible. The atmosphere, and the \"small crowd/club\" background adds a nice touch, making it seem like they're still a young club band, thus giving a fair sense of what it would be like to attend this type of show back in the mid '80s. \n\nA problem that Slayer has always had is the fact that you can almost never hear Tom Araya's bass playing, to the point that there's basically nothing else to say about it. First time I heard this, I thought maybe it'd be before they had that problem, even live, but I guess I was wrong. It would have been a great surface finish to polish this up, by turning up the bass a tad (I mean this was in a studio for God's sake)! Thankfully, both guitarists make a superb duo (preferably Jeff doing the lead), and the overall performance is spectacular for a bunch of angry, young kids.\n",
        "\nThe 2nd Slayer album with the newly reunited \"classic lineup\" World Painted Blood was an album that was highly anticipated after Christ Illusion came out. Christ Illusion while good, still felt as if something was missing. Christ Illusion while defiantly a GINORMOUS improvement over the shit stain that was God Hates Us All, still had some left over nu metal tendencies in that album that would make me cringe occasionally while listening to it. Well, I guess Dave got these guys to finally get their heads out of their ass or something, because this album is FUCKING INCREDIBLE. Finally, the almighty Slayer have finally returned! And I couldn't be any happier. \n\nYes, the speed that Slayer had somewhat lost after Undisputed Attitude has FINALLY returned. Gone is the groove, and gone are the nu metal nuances in the last three albums the boys put out leading up to this one. Seriously people, we have some Reign In Blood level shit over here. Take a song like Unit 731 for example. This song to me is signature Slayer. Evil tremolo picked riffs that rip your face off, tight, furious thrash drumming, and beautifully pissed off vocals with just a hint of melody to be found. That's the best way to describe the 7 out of the 11 tracks on this album, the other 4 have more of a South Of Heaven/Seasons In The Abyss vibe to them, but even then they're actually really good. I've always loved when Slayer do their more slower, doomy songs, but they can be either hit or miss for me sometimes. On this album though, they don't drag out the slow parts of the song, and they usually build up to even more thrash most of the time (with the exception of Human Strain, which for the most part is a dud), and it doesn't feel out of place either. Every note being played feels as though it's being built up towards something, adding to the overall dark atmosphere found on this album. \n\nThis album is actually really bleak for the most part. I mean with Slayer I've never been one to expect an album full of sunshine and rainbows, and songs about flower power (goddamn you Robert Plant), but this album is actually REALLY dark, both lyrically and musically. Many of the songs lyrically are about the evils of society, murder, hatred towards someone or something, and religion. Typical Slayer fare for sure, but for whatever reason, this album is just really evil sounding. Maybe it has to do with the fact that Tom's sister was dealing with cancer while recording this album and began to question his own faith? Who knows, but whatever the reason, it's all beautifully well done, and the album does a great job of bringing you into this album's evil atmosphere. Speaking of Tom, his vocal performance on this album is absolutely fantastic. Some of his best stuff since Divine Intervention if you ask me. He's finally mastered the barking style he introduced on God Hates Us All, while also adding some melody in there every once in awhile. It's much less grating than God Hates Us All, and it fits the songs very well. \n\nHowever, the big reason why this album isn't getting a score of 96 percent from me is one big thing that Rick Rubin the producer of this album fucked up on big time, and that's the mixing of this damn thing. It may not be as bad as God Hates Us All sure, but good god is it atrocious. The guitars feel thin, while also feeling pushed up much further in the mix then they should be. In fact, one could say that the guitar's feel staticky at times. ESPECIALLY when you get to a song like Public Display Of Dismemberment, where the guitars have a tremolo effect riff being played, but it just sounds bad. The drums are also massacred on here from time to time. The bass drum occasionally sounds clipped, which in turn triggers the guitar's sound to become clipped as well, which just makes the album sound like shit to be perfectly honest with you. Did Rick Rubin not learn from his mistakes on Death Magnetic which he did the previous year? Oh well, at least Slayer didn't suffer as badly as Metallica did. \n\nIn Conclusion, I feel that this album is on par with classics such as the first 4 Slayer albums. This is actually my favorite Slayer album too, for I feel that it combines the best aspects of Reign In Blood and South Of Heaven, while also doing something new at the same time. It's a shame that this would be the last album with the \"classic\" lineup, for Dave would leave 4 years after this was recorded over pay dispute, and then Jeff would sadly pass away nearly 3 months after Dave did. It's a very sad thing to keep in mind, but at least the classic lineup made an all killer, no filler album before it all ended, or could never truly happen again, even if Dave were to come back.\n",
        "\nAh man, even my favorite band is guilty of having a dud or two in their discography. God Hates Us All was released on September 11, 2001 (how fitting ay?), and upon release, the press was hyping this record up as a return to form after the snooze-fest otherwise known as Diabolus In Musica was released. Now to me personally, this isn't the worst album in Slayer's discography, but I'd also be lying if it were my favorite Slayer album. In fact, this just BARELY passes Diabolus as far as which album I like the least from this band. \n\nMy biggest complaint I have with this album is the production, because HOLY SHIT DOES THIS ALBUM SOUND LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT! Gone are the great production values we've become accustomed to thanks to albums such as Reign In Blood, South Of Heaven, Seasons In The Abyss, etc. Hell even Divine Intervention sounds better than this album, and that's saying something. I don't know what Slayer were going for when it came time to the mixing, but my god....It's hard to describe but I'll do my best. Imagine Death Magnetic, without the compression and clipping, but THREE TIMES AS LOUD! Seriously, the vocals are pushed to extremely loud volumes which means we're forced to hear every word Tom Araya is singing on this album, which is never a bad thing mind you, but it causes the album to get on your nerves after a while, especially with how little melody is found on this record, as opposed to just loud, in your face screaming. Also, the instrumentation isn't much better, as the drums sound extremely thin, to the point where it feels as though they're not there at times, although that's okay, because somebody had the brilliant idea to push the guitars to loudness war levels at times with this goddamn record. Yes, it's that bad. Don't believe me, listen to Bloodline and Deviance for a good idea for what I'm talking about. \n\nNow the songs themselves aren't bad, but the problem is that a lot of them (including the good ones) aren't anything that stand out as amazing or even memorable (except Disciple, New Faith (but for all the wrong reasons), Exile, and Seven Faces). This is clearly Slayer at the bottom of the barrel as far as material goes, and it really shows in the album's overall sound. This album doesn't know if it wants to be an all out thrasher like Reign In Blood, or continue the path of the groovy br0000tal sound found on Diabolus In Musica. There's a reason the band only really plays Disciple at their live shows, because looking back, it's easy to see that effort was put into these songs, it's just that they don't feel complete, or the instrumentation feels out of place with what the boys were trying to convey through the song's lyrical meaning. \n\nNow I have to address this album's lyrics, I noticed that Kerry King wrote a lot of the lyrics found on here, but I just wanna know, what the fuck were you thinking when you write a line like, \"I keep the bible in a pool of blood so that none of it's lies can affect me\"? That doesn't sound edgy at all, if anything when you hear it, it makes you really wanna facepalm really hard while cringing. Kerry CAN write good songs, so I really don't know what happened here. Trust me people, it doesn't get much better from here, as the rest of the album has plenty of other cringe worthy lyrics. I'm not gonna bother giving more examples, you just need to read some of the lyrics written on this turd and you'll see what I mean.\n\nOverall, while a big step up from Diabolus In Musica, Slayer still needed to get their heads out of their asses if they wanted to restore what little credibility they had left at this point. Thankfully, since Christ Illusion, the band have focused on writing more material that's worth of praise, rather than material that's worthy of facepalms and a lot of cringes. Oh well, no band is perfect, so at least they learned from their mistakes and didn't continue down on the path they were on.\n",
        "\nShow No Mercy is what Iron Maiden would sound like if they chose after Killers to keep Paul Di\u2019anno, ditch Martin Birch, and choose to exploit the Satanism for the almighty dollar ala Venom. The Iron Maiden comparison is made even more apt because for one brief moment, Jeff and Kerry were actually above average soloists. Show No Mercy's guitar solos that followed a path, carried melody and demonstrated exquisite technique! Just check out the fantastic lead work on the album\u2019s best song, Crionics. In the words of Ultraboris, it really is like something out of the Stained Class sessions. The twisting power-metal epic(!) Metal Storm/Face The Slayer also shows not only great lead work, but just brilliant songwriting sensibility that showcased from the beginning that the band were more than just about speed. \n\nBut of course, speed is why most people remembered Slayer, and even as early as this album it\u2019s not hard to see why. Songs like Evil Has No Boundaries, Fight Til Death and live favorite Black Magic display why even in 1983 Slayer were ahead of Metallica in terms of pure fast thrash. Show No Mercy is the most fascinating Slayer release simply because of its songwriting variety. It's the closest to \"heavy metal\" they ever were in the glory days (I loathe to refer to NWOBHM as a genre). Don't fret with that assessment, this is still very much a heavy slab of blackened speed/thrash. Nothing here really approaches doom, the slowest sections probably being the thrash break of Die By The Sword and the second half of Crionics, which packs the best riff of the entire album around 2:20. Even then it's about as slow as You've Got Another Thing Comin, which is still relatively driving.\n\nSome people will say that reverb soaked production hurts the album. I will agree insofar as getting Rick Rubin from the beginning to tell them \"you guys just aren't that black metal\" would have helped raise their sonic profile considerably. Lo-fi production or not, this album is alot like the self-titled Iron Maiden album in that the songwriting is so good it cuts through any supposed heaviness deficiency there might be. Anyone who writes these songs off for lo-fi quality is an absolute idiot who is more brainwashed by the retarded loudness wars than anything else. The reverb does make the album sound grim and hellish, but this sound lends itself much more to Hell Awaits than it does here, as by Hell Awaits Slayer had truly started to figure out the deep-black morbidity of their brand of thrash. \n\nAnother thing to note is that this is the only Slayer album to feature standard tuning. Yup, if you have Live Undead handy, listen to those versions of Die By The Sword, Antichrist, Show No Mercy, etc. and see for yourself. This particularly makes album seem like NWOBHM on steroids. Speaking of NWOBHM, check out Tom's screams! Anybody who's introduction to the band was Angel of Death is in for quite the shock when they hear this. Those fans must have thought it took every ounce of Tom's energy to nail that one particular moment, but here he just throws those around like party favors. Nothing wrong with that at all, high pitched screams are metal. We also have a few moments where Tom actually sings such as the choruses of Tormentor and Final Command as well as all of Crionics. It's kind of sad that most people think that in order to become more extreme and brutal, all semblance of tonality and melody must be shed. People think Slayer were expanding their palette on South of Heaven and Show No Mercy, but really they were subconsciously bringing Show No Mercy's ideas back into the fold. I really wish they would've take more songwriting cues from this album, ESPECIALLY nowadays. It seems like whenever they don't feel like playing fast (which in and of itself has gotten sadly generic), they seem to be stuck in a prison of what's supposed to be \"dark\" and \"evil\" and \"Hot Topic.\" Tis a damn shame.\n\nEssential Slayer. Arguably the very best debut in all of thrash. Run out and buy, put on your stereo and prepare to turn your fine dining room into a sludgy basement wasteland. SLAAAAAYYYYER!!!\n\nRecommended tracks:\nCrionics\nMetalStorm/Face The Slayer\nDie By The Sword\nShow No Mercy\n",
        "\nUpon further research I had an epiphany: while most see this as a second South of Heaven (or an attempt at a second Reign In Blood), the truth is this album, palette wise, has much more in common with the debut album than anything else. Unfortunately, Slayer seemed to have forgotten/shed most of the songwriting NWOBHM tendencies that made Show No Mercy such a shredding satanic monster. There's more varied material for sure, but the quality....Temptations is no Face The Slayer, and Dead Skin Mask damn sure is no Crionics.\n\nThere's also the problem of the fast songs starting to feel kind of derivative. I love both Hallowed Point and Born of Fire, but they feel almost interchangeable at times. Unfortunately, either Dave's drumming, (or the band's songwriting) seems to have fallen into a one rote fast tempo. Whilst I have some issues with Reign In Blood, repetitive fastness was certainly not one of them. I never felt at any point that I was listening to one long drum machine fast rhythm with assorted riffs. On Reign In Blood, the band was subtly able to make each fast song feel different. Darkness Descends managed to do it even better and make each song even more distinctive, but I digress. \n\nIt's also not a particularly good sign when the first riff on the first song of the album sounds like it was recycled from the first riff of the first song on your seminal album. Make whatever death threats you will, but War Ensemble just isn't a perfect song in my eyes because of this Angel of Death plagiarism. It's a damn shame, because the rest of the song is absolutely fantastic. The mind-bending verse riff (why the hell wasn't that the intro?! Don't want to run it into the ground I guess); Dave Lombardo's career defining solo; \"IT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE I CAN KILL\"; Kerry's nightmarish tapping guitar solo around the 3:35 mark....goddamit couldn't they have chosen another root note or something to start the whole thing off with? No, instead we get an almost pandering riff begging the fans that were alienated with South of Heaven to come back. See kids? We still love Reign In Blood. Reign In Blood! Reign in Blood!\n\nThere are some genuine classics here and not 90% ones like War Ensemble. Those songs are Blood Red, Hallowed Point, Spirit In Black, and the malevolent title track. Goddamn I fucking love the title track. Very rarely do I listen to songs on repeat when I first pick up an album but that was one of them. Sometimes I would get super impatient and skip right to the end of the album just to hear it. Anyone who dislikes this pandemic piece of pyramid pageantry is a hipster, a cunt, an asshole, a dweebie, or some miserable tumblr feltching combination of all four. You want dynamics in your Slayer? Behold the middle eastern clean guitar lick that makes you cringe as the hot desert sands slice through your face. You want a chorus? Close your eyes and forget your name. You want a monster of a guitar solo? As much as I love my beloved Crionics, I can't disagree too much with anyone who wants to say this was Jeff and Kerry's finest lead moment. Rumor has it that Kerry took some guitar lessons before recording Seasons, and good on him because it shows.\n\nIt's so strange to me that South Of Heaven was seen as experimental and Seasons In The Abyss is seen as a return to thrash roots. So much so when talking to metal veterans they would recommend I get this album first. If anything I think these folks have it backwards. Seasons feels the overall slower of the two with a much smaller thrash-to-non-thrash ratio. Which isn't to say the non-thrash parts are bad, though they definitely yield mixed results. On certain days Dead Skin Mask is alright, and other days its every bit as bad it's harshest critics says it is. Skeletons of Society, everyone says this one is underrated but I think the word they actually mean is interminable. The song is only the 4th longest track on the album yet it feels 7 minutes too long, especially with that outro. And then there's Temptation. Piece. of. Shit. If Slayer, for you, died in a horrible gardening accident after 1991, then this is by far their worst song. I can't hit the skip button fast enough when this turd starts. They kept this in the setlist after their American Carnage tour where they played Seasons In The Abyss front to back live. Talk about a need to exit piece by piece. From the anus.\n\nSeasons In The Abyss is the last attempt at what was once the most brutal band in the land trying and ultimately failing to retain that title amongst the oncoming storm of black and death metal. It's not a failure, and can very much be seen as one of the best metal albums of 1990, but hindsight is a harsh mistress. For better or worse, it has dictated that when this was when the cracks in the armor revealed themselves.\n\nRecommended tracks:\nSeasons In The Abyss\nBlood Red\n",
        "\nI never really saw anything valuable in Slayer. They write incoherently fast songs, suck at soloing, and chant a Satanic litany that can get extremely boring after a few minutes. The reason I decided to revisit Reign in Blood was that I kept hearing about Slayer, while reading about other bands, and even on the news. This inspired me to listen to this album again, and I am very glad I did.\n\nSlayer's previous two albums were alright but nothing too special. The factor that makes Reign in Blood so special reveals itself halfway through the opener, \"Angel of Death\"- variety. This album contains breakneck thrash riffs in conjunction with slower groove and, in some cases, doom riffs. This is what prevents this album from becoming boring.\n\nThe musicianship on Reign in Blood is very good, but still, it doesn't present itself as anything special. Dave Lombardo's drumming is amazing, but that aside, all of the other instruments don't do much technical stuff. Still, they all manage to play fast riffs in a manner that sounds good. Some of the riffs are godly, whereas others are a bit bland. As far as guitar playing goes, the riffing is well written and memorable, but the solos are a slight drag to the music- they are shrill, high pitched, and not very melodic at all. \n\nThe lyrics have progressed greatly since Hell Awaits. The uneducated \"Satanic\" drivel has been toned down quite a bit, making room for more varied topics. The lyrics run the whole gamut of evil- Satanism, torture, serial killers, death, and pretty much any other morbid topic conceivable. Also, the writing style behind the lyrics has improved. More descriptive terms are used, and this makes it much more interesting and enables it to evoke a deeper atmosphere.\n\nDespite a few flaws, Reign in Blood manages to live up to its reputation as one of metal's most monumental releases. It is certainly a great musical backdrop to whatever you are doing- be it lifting weights, playing guitar, or just sitting there.\n",
        "\nNo question who was miles ahead of the pack of the big 4 after this release. Much as I love Megadeth, when it came to sheer brutality no one could compete with Slayer. This is what Rush would sound like if they decided to follow the path of Venom rather than The Police. The absolute perfect next step for Slayer to evolve to after Show No Mercy. The sound was more evil, the songs were longer and faster, the lyrical subject matter was more terrifying, this is progress folks. Throw in a deliciously cruel album cover and you\u2019ve got the total package. This is the album that drew Slayer legions of fans willing to kill any intellectual, pussy or any other carbon based life form who otherwise wanted to challenge this bands legacy. After the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Metallica daring to use acoustic intros in their songs (that shit is so Motley Crue brah, you know, the band they talked nonstop smack about) as a form of progress, it's no wonder so many psychotic metal fans flocked in this bands direction. \n\nAs for the production, it does serve as a great atmosphere of descending into hell, but there is the problem of some of the riffs losing their chunky definition from being soaked in so much reverb. Probably also the reason why there aren\u2019t many mall dwelling retards lauding this over Reign In Blood. I will maintain that if the band got Rick Rubin right off the bat and used that production for this album, NO ONE would be lauding Reign In Blood as the best ever. But you have to admit its pretty impressive that it still managed to convey the ideals of black metal to an American underground with minimal exposure to Bathory and the like, right?\n\nAnother innovative facet of this album are the use of half-time sections and breakdowns, but with a sense of subtlety rather than punk rock pandering. Hell, Angel of Death, Slayer\u2019s most popular song, sounds like it came from the sessions of this album rather than any point in time in 1986. These guys weren't trying to invent a way to slam, they were just incorporating Iron Maiden time changes. I mean after all, the extreme metal way of thinking is do everything rock & roll does, but completely suck any melodicism and tonality out of it and make it all a bunch of noise, right? Wait, maybe progress isn't a good thing.\n\nThe way Dave Lombardo gels with everyone is truly something to behold. Just look at the floor tomfoolery of 0:43 in of Kill Again. You can't invent moments like that without an elite ability to keep time and react to time. And how about that double bass drum solo in At Dawn They Sleep (which would of course be lifted for Angel of Death)? He's just so good that you can't help but wonder if it was actually an unaccompanied solo based purely on releasing stored energy, or a sonic interpretation of thousands of dead vampire and human bodies falling to the ground at once.\n\nHighlights: The title track is of course a blast, though I do wish it wasn't always the go to song when picking tracks from this to play live. The most underrated song on here is probably Crypts of Eternity, a soul twisting epic with two breakdowns intertwined into each other. Dig those creepy call and response harmonies that start around the three minute mark. This song would have been a stroke of genius just as an instrumental but then going into VIOLATE OF YOUR BROKEN SEAL *roll* OF *roll* HELL etc., etc., topped off with yet another magnificent Rob Halford high pitched scream. Ah the good old days when Tom threw those out like party favors. The whole thing is also surprisingly catchy, but the choruses you'll remember the most are Kill Again and At Dawn They Sleep. Just well developed, rhythmically bouncing [your head on to stalagmites] vocals that prove yelling and screaming in metal can be used effectively if done properly.\n\nIt takes real talent to merge progressive metal, thrash and black metal seamlessly into one sound whilst making it sound effortless. It's a heavenly shame that Slayer never wrote songs like this again. Even Phil Anselmo admits this loss. Hell Awaits separates the real Slayer fans from the edge-lords who think the band was a joke before Reign In Blood (and that includes you Eddie Trunk).\n\n\nRecommended songs:\n\nKill Again\nAt Dawn They Sleep\n",
        "\nI mean its slow compared to Darkness Descends, Pleasure To Kill and....Wait, what the fuck am Is saying? No, it's not goddamn slow! It's not a doom album! I could maybe understand the trepidations if Slayer foisted Dance of December Souls on the metal public, but this is not Dance of December Souls. This is thrash; Pure unadulterated thrash. Just because the opening song isn\u2019t a debatable reference to Jewish annihilation does not make it terrible! \n\nIn any case, Slayer\u2019s 4th thrash album carries on in the tradition of quality, despite facing heavy competition in the speed department from the likes of Dark Angel, Kreator and just about the entire thrash scene. While they certainly weren\u2019t slowing down completely and going Candlemass on our asses, we did see them expanding their artistic palette. For one, Tom Araya actually sings for the first time since 1983 on Behind The Crooked Cross and Spill The Blood, and we see Slayer start to grasp the idea of tension and release. This is best demonstrated on Live Undead, which deceivingly starts with a midpaced rhythm, Tom delivers a fantastic scream with (THE PAIN) a couple of more lines, a drum roll, then all hell breaks loose. Yea, again, I have no idea why this is the slow album, especially considering there were slow moments on Reign In Blood (the beginning of Criminally Insane and Jesus Saves anyone?). This album is a classic and gives a giant middle finger to critics who say the band can\u2019t be like Metallica and write meaningful slow and fast music. It ain\u2019t my favorite song on the album, but I\u2019d rather listen to Mandatory Suicide over Orion any day.\n\nWhile the brutality of Reign In Blood itself was great, outside of the context of the album some of tracks felt really underdeveloped. NOTHING is underdeveloped here. Fuck if Angel of Death and Raining Blood were tacked on to the beginning and ending of this album THEN we'd have the greatest thrash album of all time, my friend. That's not a knock on the title track or Spill The Blood either. Both tracks are the key examples of the band slowing down, but they each take the morbid feelings presented by Fade To Black and multiply them by double digit exponents. This is the sound of Leatherface's gallows, folks.\n\nOf course, there is the drumming. Mother of Lemmy that fucking drumming. Not that Dave Lombardo wasn't already the best in the business up to this point but you could tell the man was eager to do more than just speed metal and boy does it show. The title track alone is easily one of his most memorable performances. I (and I imagine most other drummers) could air drum that shit by heart. It's simply incredible how this man manages to top himself with every release, and he even would go on to do it again with Seasons (which is actually really the only thing about that album that's a substantial improvement over this one)!\n\nThere are flaws, of course. Who the hell decided that there needed to be a solid minute of feedback after the title track? I looked at its play count once on my iTunes and it was so low because it has to play all the way to the end to register and I would always skip after the song itself was done. Maybe waiting for the next song to start was what really tried the patience of the \"Only fast Slayer is real\" crowd. I also think that while the Priest cover is solid, it really only serves the purpose of telling their ignorant fans to not say Judas Priest sucks, that without them you wouldn't have your precious Reign In Blood. And admirable stance to be sure, but I always feel like covers should always be B-sides unless they are truly exceptional. Like I said, this one is good, but the original? That has one of those legendary vocal covers that you just do. not. top. ever. Tom's vocal take is eerie in its own way, but again, that was one of those songs that made Rob Halford ROB FUCKING HALFORD.\n\nSouth of Heaven is Slayer continuing to kick more ass and carve their name in more wrists. An improvement over its predecessor and probably the only Rick Rubin album that stands toe to toe with Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits. Begat your cunting daughters you bastard sons!\n\nRecommended songs:\nLive Undead\nSouth of Heaven\nGhosts of War\n",
        "\nSlayer is a band infamous the world over for their aggressive style and often offensive lyricism. They have been a dominating force in the thrash metal genre for decades and have reached high levels of success throughout their illustrious career. The band however has taken a huge hit over the past few years, losing both founding guitarist Jeff Hanneman and drummer Dave Lombardo. Many weren't convinced that this crippled version of the band would persist and release any new material. Well, for better or worse, they did. \n\nRepentless is Slayer's twelfth album and it features Exodus' very own Gary Holt on guitar and long time friend of the band Paul Bostaph behind the kit. Despite this all star level cast, the album falls flat on almost every conceivable level. Barring \"Piano Wire\", every song and all of the lyrics on the album were written by Kerry King. This becomes very obvious by the third track as by then the words \"fuck\", \"society\", and \"mediocrity\" have been used several times. You can seriously hear at least one of these words on every single track. The lyrics are one dimensional, bland, and detract from the overall experience in some cases such as in \"Vices\" where we get to hear a 51 year-old Tom Araya belt out \"a little violence is the ultimate drug, let's get high!\". They are deplorable and manage to completely nullify any good vocal delivery made by Araya. \n\nInstrumentally however, we are handed more of a mixed bag. There are some very good performances present on this record such as Bostaph's drumming which is always on point and intricate. At some points in fact, the drum fills and beats were the only thing keeping a boring riff relevant such as the climax in \"Implode\". Gary Holt's solos are also, for the most part, nothing short of stellar. I actually recall laughing out loud when I heard his first solo in the title track as it simply stomps on King's solo that took place seconds before. Despite these positives, the lot of the riffs come off largely as uninspired and contrived, with exceptions being present in the title track and the eerily experimental \"When the Stillness Comes\". You can tell that King was just tossing in riffs left and right without anybody beside him to critique him and sadly, this is an area where Jeff's creative input is terribly missed. There are too many mid tempo 7-string riffs and almost no risks are taken outside of the first five frets of the lowest two strings. Slayer is simply sticking to what they know and this time, it is painfully obvious. \n\nThis album disappointed me at almost every turn. From the intro track that goes nowhere, the carelessly made lyrics, to the lackluster riffage present in almost every song. There is simply little here that is actually worth purchasing or even worth hearing for a second time. This album has cemented the point that, now more than ever, Slayer has become a caricature and a mockery of itself. None of the savage prowess present on earlier efforts remains here and what we do get is little more than sub par fan service. Kerry King clearly has run out of ideas and is resorting to retreading old ground in order to make sales off of the nostalgia of \"the good old days\".\n",
        "\nI think alot of Slayer's reputation has come about by picking up the ball where Metallica fumbled it. Everybody wanted Metallica to be this massive, masculine viking ship that killed all the hair bands (and new wave, punk rock, and other forms of music), overthrow the government and return to primitive times where men were men and everybody ate with their hands. Unfortunately, they kept slowing down, switching the clean guitar channel on and taking Cliff Burton seriously as a songwriter, so unfortunately the Manchurian Candidate sleeper formula was never able to properly activate.\n\nForgive me for that cunty bit of pretentiousness, but it always seems like whenever this is held up as the greatest thrash album of all time, fans always want to say FUCK MASTER OF PUPPETS, ASSHOLES SHOULD HAVE JUST WROTE FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE AD NASEUM, BURNT OUT AND GONE BACK TO GAS STATIONS. Don't get me wrong, Reign In Blood is a classic and is indeed a better album than the aforementioned Puppets, but it wasn't even the best 86 album from the big 4 (here's a hint, it begins with P and ends with eace Sells But Who's Buying)? Nor was it even the best thrash album of 86, which incidentally also begins with a P, but I digress. I frequently hear this lauded as a middle finger to everything that was going on in metal and thrash at that time, but to me, it really only seemed that people were adamant about no clean guitar whatsoever on their thrash albums. Hell even No Love had that noodly bit at the beginning.\n\nWhat makes a truly classic album to me are the songs. A collection of all killer no filler, both hits and deep cuts that are legendary in its own genre circle, and with some luck outside of it. But as far as I can tell, nobody I know has ever given a shit about Piece By Piece, Reborn, Necrophobic (except of course the band) or Epidemic. A shame for that last one, because that would easily be my pick for killer track no one talks about. The thrash break alone is excellent, its just happens to be stuck on an album with an even MORE legendary thrash break. \n\nAnd lets get this out of the way, the \"hits\" on this album, Angel of Death, Postmortem and Raining Blood are all stone-cold genre defining metal classics. Anyone one of these could be on Show No Mercy or Hell Awaits and have been a highlight. Matter of fact I would actually go so far as to call Angel of Death the greatest metal song of all time. Yup, as in, all of metal. The thing about metal is, as great as it is for it to become acceptable critically and commercially, there should still be a touch of disdain, hatred or uncomfortability about it. Something that makes the average square in the bible belt cringe. 30+ years later Angel of Death can't even get on Metallica's own Guitar Hero game even with Lars Ulrich's insistence. I'd like to repeat and break that down because it's fairly important: Lars Ulrich, the slimy corporate rockstar sycophant who's become buddy buddy with everything that old Metallica stood against, HE couldn't even get that song on THEIR OWN GAME. Somehow I imagine Caught Somewhere In Time or Battle Hymns or Rebellion In Dreamland ending up with that type of promotion, but not that one. The Hollywood types might get offended.\n\nAnd as much as I love to laud Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits, even I have to admit the one thing this album has that they don't is the absolutely stellar production job. This might be the greatest metal album ever produced. Nothing about it sounds dated. Even when you put on Ride The Lightning or Powerslave you can definitely tell they were made in the 80s. Not there's anything wrong about that, but this still sounds like it could come out today. But I also have to admit that if those two albums had that crunchy-as-fuck, wall of brutality, no reverb sound, Reign In Blood wouldn't be hailed as much of a breakthrough as it is.\n\nIf this isn't already in your collection, definitely correct that problem, but walk, don't run to get it. Also if you're part of the MP3 generation and you already have Angel of Death and Raining Blood on your computer (like I did), well, know that you already have what you need (three of four tracks aside). No Crionics or Crypts of Eternitys here.\n\n\nRecommended Tracks:\nAngel of Death\nRaining Blood\nEpidemic\nJesus Saves\n",
        "\nSo I'll be straight forward with this, of Slayer's 80s discography I feel this album is the most overlooked and under praised. I'd even go so far as to say the fan favorite Reign in Blood is overly praised. It's pretty simple, I like thrash metal for its riffs and guitar work and while Reign in Blood certainly achieves a fast and aggressive sound it is put to shame by the riffs displayed here.\n\nFrom the get go you can tell Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman mean business. As soon as the album starts with Evil Has No Boundaries we're greeted by the roaring shriek of Tom Araya and a vicious bit of soloing before launching into the rest of the song's thrashing assault. The song has at least 3 shredding lead sections that could easily be seen as solos as well as a riff filled with attitude. Now sadly the rest of the album doesn't follow suit with such liberal use of shredding as each other song only has one solo, but each of these solos is just as good and each shows that the respective performers are skilled at their craft. While the riffs aren't as breakneck as they could be there is a plethora of them. Riff wise the album really emphasises the NWoBHM influence on thrash with a few gallop like sections and being relatively light on tremolo picking in favor of more melodic sections. See Metal Storm/Face the Slayer and Crionics for examples. Now it doesn't have the muscle of later releases thanks to a softer guitar tone, but the aggression, attitude and speed is still there.\n\nFrom another perspective this is probably the best album for Tom Araya, his bass is pretty much drowned out but this is his most dynamic vocal delivery as he easily and fluidly goes back and forth between clean melodic singing, his harsher yelled style and his high shrieks. He does each well and times them well, the singing helps create catchy moments that act as ear worms and the yells work with the riffs to make an aggressive release.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle here is the drumming. Lombardo delivers a steady and precise delivery regardless of what he's doing whether it's the sped up AC/DC style bass and snare or the barrages of double pedal. He's not as fast and relentless as he is on other records but his consistency has a charm all of its own and his fills hit like a sledgehammer.\n\nAs far as production goes I think it's pretty solid, the only thing I have to criticize is how low the bass is for most of the album, a more prevalent bass sound as well as a thicker tone would've made this album quite heavy and without detracting from any of its other qualities.\n\nAll in all, a fine classic thrash record. \n\nKey tracks include The Antichrist, Crionics, Metal Storm/Face the Slayer and Evil Has No Boudaries.\n",
        "\nDue to whatever reason, the Rock Hard magazine awarded \"World Painted Blood\" with eight of ten points. Okay, this does not say much. These obviously insane dudes also gave eight points for \"God Hates Us All\" and 8,5 points for \"Diablous in Musica\". To call this assessment practice inflationary is the least I can do. Let's look the truth in the eye. Slayer's eleventh album was, compared with the aforementioned works, a milestone. Yet compared with their early classics, it left the audience disturbed and confused. Just take, for example, \"Americon\". A groovy mid-tempo number with socio-critical lyrics, is this really what Slayer stands for? What makes a band with such a success story under its belt think that it must deliver trendy tunes? I beg for a little bit more courage and self-confidence, but the disrooted four-piece - what cheek! - follows its own ambivalent ideas.\n\nIt does not make things better that \"Americon\" belongs to the strongest tracks of the album in view of its challenging riffing and the coherent line after the chorus. It is a good piece, but performed by the wrong band. I doubt that it would work on your Slayer mix tape, because it has not much in common with the ferocity of those songs that established the band's once glorious reputation. Of course, Slayer's musical integrity has been already getting more and more dubious after the release of \"Diabolus...\", but this is scant consolation. Well, maybe I am too harsh, because this is not a very representative piece. Apart from this song, Slayer play more or less the style that made \"Reign in Blood\" to a monument. Yet the divine album from the year 1986 showed the pure form of thrash at its best, while the here presented lukewarm conglomerate of noisy outbursts shocks with an incalculable amount of relatively meaningless pieces. The opening title track is more or less okay, nothing special and slightly uninspired, but okay. However, already the second and the third number just pass by. One can call them \"violent\" or \"angry\", but I would like to use words like \"faceless\" or \"emotionless\". Despite the undisputed technical skills of Dave Lombardo and the other guys, these tunes typify the fundamental problem of \"World Painted Blood\". The legendary thrash brigade is in search of its own, once authentic rage, but this mission is futile. Try to take a trip back in time, the result would be the same.\n\nThe longer the story goes, the bigger the aforementioned problem gets. \"Hate Worldwide\" has an intensive instrumental part and \"Public Display of Dismemberment\" knows how to spell aggression, but I cannot see that this kind of tunes enriches the catalogue of the band in a sustainable manner. Not to mention soulless trash such as \"Not of this God\". Admittedly, all songs deliver a proper degree of vehemence. With regard to the status of Slayer and the formation's financial opportunities, one can surely imagine that the production is once again more or less perfect. Too bad that I am not a fan of recording technology, but of thrash metal. So let's get back to the tracks themselves. The most embarrassing one is probably \"Playing with Dolls\". It is not the worst, but Slayer have tried to compose a song that builds up a sinister tension and shines with a profound depth. Frankly, there is neither tension nor depth, just some fairly solid riffs and leads. \"Beauty Through Order\", a number with a roughly comparable pattern, works better. Its first speed part does not make much sense, but the following sequence with its slightly weird guitar figures creates an adequate atmosphere of discomfort. By the way, this sequence is the only moment that really builds a bridge to the glorious past of the (fallen) thrash kings. I am sorry, but this is not enough to become enthusiastic. Perhaps my compatriots of the Rock Hard Magazine still listen to \"World Painted Blood\" at regular intervals, but I don't like to spend my time with an album that reflects mediocrity and disorientation like almost no other work.\n",
        "\nThis song is a bit of bitter sweet treat. It has things going for it, it has things that don't. On the one hand it's an odd cut to be chosen as the opening and title track of an album because, well because I would expect the band to choose a better cut for both roles, on the other hand though, that makes this song a pretty sample of what's coming up, as a single should, because it does paint an accurate portrait of the sound and direction the rest of the album will take.\n\nSome parts of the song feel a bit lazy and are obvious call backs to some of the band's better days, like the intro with it's slow build up and eerie guitar lead being a bit reminiscent of Raining Blood and Hell Awaits, but not as well executed. \n\nOther parts take obvious queues from more recent trends like the main riff, which can easily be experienced by humming \"chug chug chuggy chug chug chuggy chug\" loudly to yourself. In fairness Slayer has never exactly written a plethora of technically tinged riffs, but they also never sounded like a more metallic Earth Crisis before now. \n\nThe fact of the matter though is that this is Slayer we're talking about, the guys music is about 2 steps away from being pure METAL ESSENCE given tangible physical form, they can take all the most banal elements of metal and still make a solid banger. They however are still human though and cannot take a bunch of negatives and rearrange them into a positive.\n\nThat slow solo is still boring as a guitar solo can get, Tom's vocals have still aged and he sounds strained in a few places and that guitar tone leaves a lot to be desired, especially if they plan on whipping out a full on breakdown with it, which like the intro seems to call back to Raining Blood, except while the intro was still passable, the breakdown is a mess awkwardly pairing mosh sensibility with droning spoken word vocals that are completely harmless.\n\nThe good outweighs the bad though and while this certainly should never be anyone's favorite Slayer song, I do find it to be worth returning to on occasion, or perhaps its just worth not skipping if it came up in the queue for a streaming service.\n",
        "\nI don't give a crap about the whole \"Slayer is a holy cow\" thing, nor do I buy into all the labels that their post-90s albums have carried, where tags like \"trend follower\", \"nu metal\", and \"comeback\" have been thrown about with each successive release. I have not listened to God Hates Us All (and according to most of the reviews for it, I don't need to), but Christ Illusion does seem to be one of the few Slayer albums that deserves a tag like \"comeback\", since it does largely reintroduce the elements that made Slayer distinctive among thrash bands. Opinions have differed, fights have surely started, but this is recognizably Slayer and recognizably a thrash album.\n\nSo let's start with how it sounds. First off, it has a better production than most other Slayer albums, making the guitars a whole lot more powerful and upfront than ever before, while Dave Lombardo has a nice drum sound too. The general impression puts the aggression of the band in your face, though it isn't too sharp, the guitars staying rounded and almost sludgy at moments, bludgeoning with girth rather than killer strikes. Tom Araya is a step back from the forefront in the vocal department and his bass doesn't get a lot of freedom, playing beneath the band at most points, although there's a very broad boom coming from his direction, even if little of his work is distinct. The lead tone is also fairly good, but neither King or Hanneman really play a great deal noteworthy in this respect. As such, the sound of the album suggests that Slayer had a good grounding on which to build an impressive album.\n\nIn the end, it doesn't really happen, though there are pleasing moments in many of the songs and a few genuinely good songs. 'Flesh Storm' is a reassuringly crazy opener, getting a handful of riffs and some pace behind it, plus using a very standard Slayer lead-in with those drum holds. The mid-paced riff moves great as well, clambering over the landscape like some kind of German panzer, even if the solos seem rather perfunctory. 'Catalyst' follows a similar pattern with better leads, then so does 'Consfearacy', then so does 'Black Serenade', then 'Cult' turns to the same path after a long intro. Therefore, it's helpful that the formula works quite well, yet unfortunate that there isn't much difference between the structure or riffs of those numbers. There are also songs that return to Slayer's tradition of being dark and menacing, although with Araya's quiet and weakish vocals (he sounds like he's calling his neighbour from across the road) they don't quite have the desired effect, instead existing as simply slow songs, which defeats the purpose. Some of these songs, such as 'Skeleton Christ' and 'Catatonic', sound like they have some downtuned groove riffing as a primary focus, though that comes from the production and the lack of accelerating riffs more than anything. These pass as reasonable, but do not represent much that can be added to the album's quality. However, 'Jihad' marks itself out as something different, building from strange suspense into a medium-paced mover that refreshes itself with an unusual yet effective lick, certainly untried in Slayer's career.\n\nThe impression I get of this album is one of a band frustrated or slightly bored with their own music, since there isn't a great deal of inspiration, generally just being Slayer. The lyrics are mostly written by Kerry King and deal with usual topics of violence and war, as well as lots of religious stuff, mostly in a way that sounds angry and unleashed but in the same way as an action movie tries to get as many explosions in as possible without actually killing any of the main characters. In short, it's not really as destructive as it wants to be. Some of the songs, especially 'Flesh Storm', 'Jihad', and 'Cult', stick pretty well, but this isn't essential for most Slayer fans.\n",
        "\n...makes us stronger, but honestly, I have never felt a new strength after listening to this output. \"God Hates Us All\" is a fitting title. Nobody can say any longer that he loves us, because exactly 15 years ago, he did not prevent the release of this miserable work that begged for the deceptive love of the zeitgeist. In 2001, self-respect and integrity seemed to be foreign words for Slayer. The musicians kowtowed to people who had never been interested in their first albums. How embarrassing for a band with a once legendary status.\n\nAlready the first track after the nonsensical intro points out that Slayer have taken a dangerous route. Instead of returning to the pure form of thrash, the music that made them great and simultaneously the music that they made great, the dudes meander between some old-school riffs, then modern tones and annoying breaks that kill the atmosphere, the power and the coherence of the song. These breaks seem to be an end in itself, but the truth is even worse. They are Slayer's tool in order to gain new customer groups and this blatantly obvious strategy sucks. \"God Send Death\", actually a good track, implodes completely after two minutes because of a moronic break and the following robot-like vocals. Tracks like \"New Faith\" share the destiny of \"God Send Death\". Slayer ruin their own compositions with instinctive certainty.\n\nOf course, everybody has the right to modify the style of his music. Yet it is always an advantage to change your mindset on a step-by-step basis. But Slayer, slightly megalomaniac, do not respect the basics. They behave like a little defiant child who leaves home without knowing what comes next. Another example: \"Exile\". Its opening riffs remind me of \"Chemical Warfare\" and I therefore hope to see the light at the end of tunnel. Forgive me for being a fool, the solo section with its strange tones destroys the tune from within. However, to comment the single songs disguises the overall impression. All these staccato parts on the one hand and the groove elements on the other hand shit on the rare old school moments. Not to mention the lameness of flops such as \"Deviance\". Cool numbness has replaced demonic power. Is this really Slayer or is it another band with Araya on vocals? By the way, it is an extremely monotonous performance of the most Catholic thrash singer of all times. Scientists report that the charisma of his voice was on vacation during the recordings.\n\nNo, the album did not come as a bad surprise. Already \"Diabolus in Musica\" had indicated that Slayer had left its successful course. My only hope was that this album remained an isolated case, an experiment gone wrong. \"God Hates Us All\" proved the opposite. The continuing downward spiral reached shocking proportions. Only the more or less flawless production does not show signs of weakness and, almost unbelievable, the last track of the album shows the real Slayer. An ironic twist of fate? However, this album deserves a severe judgement. One could write many more lines about the nerve-shattering and torn songs that it holds, but exceptionally I have better things to do. I need a therapeutic treatment. Where is my copy of \"Show No Mercy\"?\n",
        "\nI confess and beg for mercy. The shame is on me. Anyway, I feel the need to make my sin public. Here it is: I never understood why so many maniacs worship this release so intensely. My problem is the B side of the vinyl. Nevertheless, let's start with the first track, the monumental \"Chemical Warfare\". Honestly speaking, this is the only song which can challenge the tunes of the debut, at least in my humble opinion.\n\nThis does not mean that it follows a comparable approach. Quite the opposite. From today's perspective, \"Chemical Warfare\" appears as a harbinger of the pieces of \"Hell Awaits\". More complex than each and every song of \"Show No Mercy\", it rushes over the battlefields which is littered with thousands of dead bodies. Of course, the debut's element of surprise is not reproducible. Slayer's ravenous appetite for extreme metal is already well known. However, the group does not lack of enthusiasm and combativeness. The violent approach of Huntington Park's loudest newcomers is authentic. Tom Araya's vocal performance delivers satanic vibes in abundance, Dave Lombardo is anything but lazy while torturing his drum kit and the famous guitar duo avoids any kind of redundant gimmicks. In a nutshell, \"Chemical Warfare\" is a sonic nightmare of the most pleasant kind and tastes definitely better than, for example, mustard gas. Okay, this might be a matter of course. But it is also nothing new that hip hop and rap suck. Nevertheless, I remind my friends of this self-evident fact from time to time.\n\nYet Slayer are not able to hold the level. The noisy solos of the two further tracks of the vinyl lack of inspiration, while the comparatively unspectacular verses and the average choruses leave a rather vapid aftertaste. I am realistic enough to say that the best early thrash full-lengths originated from the United States of America. But I am also patriotic enough to declare that the best early thrash EP was produced in Germany, even if I do not know its name. (\"Flag of Hate\" or \"Sodomy and Lust\"? Decide for yourself.) With that said, I want to emphasize that my expectations were extremely high after \"Show No Mercy\". In other words, \"Captor of Sin\" and the title track were neither powerless nor ill-defined. Yet totally mind-blowing elements like the riff of \"The Antichrist\" or the mid-part of \"Die by the Sword\" (remember the unbeatable \"Watch as flowers decay\"-sequence) did not show up. And, by the way, the slightly dull sound also did not fully convince.\n\nOnly for the sake of completeness, I mention the CD bonus track \"Aggressive Perfector\". In terms of quality, this one-size-fits-all bonus (among other things, it appears on the European version of \"Show No Mercy\", the \"Postmortem\" EP and the here presented EP) lies exactly between the A side and the B side of the vinyl. Nevertheless, it is not the most original bonus. Thus, as a little act of revenge, here comes my one-rating-fits-all: 80%, regardless of the format.\n",
        "\nThat intro scream of Tom Araya pretty much sums up the feeling of this release. Punk-fueled thrash metal, built to destroy, straight from a basement rehearsal room somewhere in Los Angeles. Only that the band in the room is fuckin' Slayer! In case you didn't figure it out by now, I'm in love with Slayer.\n\nMinor Threat, T.S.O.L., The Stooges, Verbal Abuse, D.I., Dr. Know and hell, even Texas crossover gods D.R.I. get their Slayer treatment. But that's not about it: 3 originals by Slayer are added as well. Can't Stand You and DDAMM were to be something in Pap Smear (Hanneman/Lombardo/Rocky George crossover project that never released anything), definitely different from what Slayer have ever done. Plus one trademark twisted Slayer song: Gemini. Slow as death itself, with Tom sounding sinister as hell, as if he wants to cut your throat when you least expect it. The 90s were the times when Slayer sounded sinister in a different way than the one we were used to in their 80s works.\n\nThe album flows smoothly and can be easily loved by any old school punk/hardcore fan, not just thrashers. This is just Slayer's way of saying \"thank you\" to some of the old school punk stuff that influenced them to go faster and harder and play like there's no tomorrow. And since we're talking punk and hardcore, it's got that raw feel that I truly love about this release and that's what makes it so special in the Slayer catalogue. Another note on my part, I love how they have given lots of credit to D.R.I. for their, lest we forget their first albums' influence on Slayer's \"Reign In Blood\" (listen to the \"Dirty Rotten LP\" and \"Dealing With It\" one more time) or Lombardo wearing D.R.I. t-shirts ever since the \"Show No Mercy\" days (check Combat Tour videos).\n\nLastly, since we're reviewing a fuckin' Slayer record, there couldn't be a lack in controversy, now could it? On \"Guilty Of Being White\" (Minor Threat), a song about reverse racism issues in ghettos, they deliberately changed the final line to \"guilty of being right!\" as an example of extremely provocative sense of humour. Don't know about you, but I love some political incorrectness once in a while.\n\nNo more words, just enjoy this 33-minute-long thrash/punk/hardcore fest! SLAYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!\n",
        "\nWhile this may not be Slayer's most important 1980s album, it is fucking great for what it is. There really isn't much music here. With only 4 songs (\"Aggressive Perfector\" was not included on the original release), it only reaches 17 minutes in length. That being said, Slayer still manages to get the job done in this short run time, and they do it well. \"Haunting the Chapel\" is a non-stop thrash fest. It actually differs quite a bit from the band's debut full-length album \"Show No Mercy\" which was released the previous year, about six months before this. That album leaned towards the NWOBHM sound quite heavily although it injected that sound with a bit of furious thrash metal. With \"Haunting the Chapel\", the band tried something a bit different. \n\nUnlike \"Show No Mercy\" which draws a lot of its sound from the aforementioned NWOBHM movement, \"Haunting the Chapel\" is a full-on thrash assault. This EP contains little of the once prominent NWOBHM influence and actually showcases some of the early sounds of death metal. Now this is still a thrash EP but the death metal influence is oh so obvious. It is much faster and, well, sound so much more brutal. This is definitely one of the heaviest recordings Slayer has ever produced. \"Sinister\" and \"evil\" really are perfect adjectives that can be used to describe this music. Basically this can be noted as a transitional piece between \"Show No Mercy\" and the band's next full-length, \"Hell Awaits\". \"Chemical Warfare\" is probably my favorite song on this EP. It starts off with a heavy, chugging riff at a moderate pace and then, out of nowhere, a blasphemous barrage of energetic thrash riffs explode in the listener's face. \"Captor of Sin\" begins with a solo which is a bit odd, and somewhat sloppy. I've never listened to Slayer for the solos as Kerry King must be one of the worst guitarists to listen to for soloing. His solos tend to be all over the place. On this EP, this is really no exception. I think his solos were the best on \"Show No Mercy\" which happens to be my second favorite Slayer album, following \"Hell Awaits\". Riff wise, however, this album totally shines. \"Aggressive Perfector\" totally retains that evil atmosphere and is a real rocker of a track, and comes on the CD's reissue. It features some slower, more groove oriented sections in comparison to the other three tracks. \n\nThe drums follow the guitars unadulterated energy extremely closely. We have the typical thrash drumming that draws its roots in hardcore punk. Tom Araya's vocals actually differ slightly here from \"Show No Mercy\" in that they are far darker and sound more demented. The high-pitched wails are gone and in their place remains the barking vocals Tom will continue to use throughout Slayer's longevity. And due to this, another element of the NWOBHM movement has been abandoned and honestly because of the prototype hybridized death/thrash style this EP follows, this was for the best.\n\nI can't say this is the best thing Slayer has ever done, as I do prefer the energetic \"Show No Mercy\" and the acclaimed \"Hell Awaits\" a bit more than this. This EP could definitely have been longer but was a good taste and indicator of what would eventually become of Slayer's music. Plus, \"Chemical Warfare\" must be one of the greatest songs Slayer has ever recorded. This is definitely one of the more evil albums from these guys and likewise, continues to remain a fan favorite.\n",
        "\nAside from the title track, \"You Against You\" is my personal favourite tune on the recently released \"Repentless\". Its lyrics include the message \"it makes no sense that you tie your own noose\". Allow me to add in all modesty that it also makes no sense to publish an insincere album which has not much in common with the style that the vast majority of the fans prefers. However, to adapt a German proverb, I guess Araya and his companions were still (relatively) young and they needed the money. The result was one of their worst products up to now.\n\nThe most popular songs of early and / or successful albums define the identity of a band. This does not mean that any form of development is a cardinal sin. Darkthrone have cleverly managed to re-invent themselves again and again. Their outsider image is the common element that unites their works. Yet it is a fact that some bands don't find the right balance between constancy and evolution. Slayer belong to these bands. They did no longer believe in the dogma of high velocity. This was not really new, inter alia their non-punk track on \"Undisputed Attitude\" had already pointed in a new direction. However, on their eighth album, Slayer made excessive use of mid-tempo parts and the result were ponderous cripples such as \"In the Name of God\". To add insult to injury, this was one of the tunes that additionally suffered from inappropriate breaks. Heavyweight rhythms can replace high velocity successfully, but they cannot develop their effect if somebody constantly applies the emergency brakes. One could say that Slayer had lost their magic \"piece by piece\" after the release of \"Reign in Blood\", but the now preferred, more or less trendy style almost appeared as an unexpected act of betrayal. The choppy riffing of \"Stain of Mind\" awoke memories of legions of mediocre bands, but it was not linked with the approach that established the gargantuan reputation of Slayer. The same applied for the robotized vocals that showed up occasionally. \n\nOf course, the musicians had too much energy and creativity to release a great pile of shit. A certain number of good riffs and some fairly intensive parts proved evidence that the formation was actually still able to compose a more than solid album. For example, the few dramatic parts of \"Overt Enemy\" did not lack of intensity, \"Perversions of Pain\" scored with a weird melody line and the first song unleashed a proper storm after the half-baked intro. Unfortunately, I have to add that \"Bitter Peace\" had some parts that seemed to be borrowed from \"War Ensemble\". Nevertheless, this was a promising opener - and it was simultaneously deceptive, because the overall result was disappointing. \n\nWithout the vocals of Tom Araya, who had put his heart and soul in his performance, I would not have identified this work as a Slayer album. These groovy parts, this embarrassing attitude and the absence of murderous brutality formed a product that did not meet my expectations. It seemed to be no coincidence that Slayer's logo on the cover surprised with a new design; this group wanted to represent something new, due to whatever reason. The fat production did not help to make things much better. The sound was powerful and heavy, but a good production can only underline the vitality of strong songs. Vice versa, it is never able to make weak songs good. Therefore, I would rather have preferred to be confronted with some insidious and aggressive \"Show No Mercy\" leftovers in demo sound quality. Yet the protagonists revealed their truly merciless face and tortured the audience with meaningless, one-dimensional and tedious titles such as \"Love to Hate\". And allow me to come back to the widespread absence of high velocity; who the hell had told them that mid-tempo is sexy? Many good efforts were killed by the unpleasant dominance of pretty slow-moving rhythms. I know, I have mentioned this point already, but the co-inventors of high speed must accept this repeated criticism.\n\n\"Diabolus in Musica\" left an extremely ambivalent impression, barely enough to keep body and soul together. Without fillers like the stupid and seemingly endless \"Wicked\", it could have been a little bit better. Yet it is pointless to think about a less weak configuration of the album. The best salad is a nice piece of meat, but this finding is not helpful as long as only vegetarian meals are offered.\n",
        "\nIn 1983, Slayer released their debut album Show No Mercy. This album showcased the band's NWOBHM influences like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, only difference being it was twice as fast as either of those bands and it's themes were more Satanic. The album's sound, while undoubtedly thrash, was a lot more melodic and less threatening than Slayer's later work. Their EP Haunting the Chapel, released one year later, showed the band's sound heading in a much darker and less melodic direction. The transformation of their sound from a NWOBHM tribute band to a full-on thrash band was complete with the release of Hell Awaits.\n\nThis album, as well as showcasing Slayer's classic sound, also introduced more complex song structures, with a few different riffs and tempo changes present on each song, especially on longer songs like \"Crypts of Eternity\" and the title track. Speaking of the title track, it contains the perfect way to open an album as evil as this one. The infamous back masked chant of \"Join us\" is unsettling enough, but just as the chant ends, the death growl of \"Welcome back\" is heard. Before the listener has time to recover from that sinister greeting, the song itself welcomes us back to the demented world of Slayer in the best way it can: with sludgy guitar riffs and a slow, three minute build to the second, faster half of the song. This album may only contain seven songs, but they're all evil, demented and thrashy in their own way. \"Hell Awaits\" and \"Kill Again\" are great picks for the first two songs. They both hook the listener straight away by giving off a menacing and evil vibe, especially \"Kill Again\" with lyrics spoken by a serial killer who's violence is described in graphic detail and a speed so fast it would even make a cheetah reach for the chill pills. The rest of the songs give off the same malicious intent of the first two songs. \"At Dawn they Sleep\" sounds the most evil with it's slow tempo and Tom growling the intentions of vampires lusting for blood. There really isn't any bad songs on this album, although the album does have a head scratching moment in the form of the album's closer \"Hardening of the Arteries\". It sounds somewhat rushed as it seems to fill time before the riff that opened the album is also played to finish it. The song sounds like it was put there to fill out space and although it's a good song, it does give one the suspicious thought that the band was struggling to come up with a song to finish the album with.\n\nThe individual performances on the album are great. As a whole, this would have to be Tom's best vocal performance on any album period. He does everything from his trademark shouting, to growling on \"At Dawn they Sleep\" to the high pitched screams on \"Kill Again\" and \"Crypts of Eternity\". He experiments with what his voice can do is extensive and he nails it every time. The bass, while being much more audible than on Show No Mercy (or any future album for that matter), still isn't given much time in the spotlight. \"Praise of Death\" is it's best song, simply because it's the song where it's given the most screen time. The guitars sound really powerful and raw on every song, meshing with the evil themes on the album nicely and making them seem more sinister. The drums are perfect, but one can't expect anything less from Dave Lombardo. This album sees him in top form, especially with his patented double bass drumming, Dave has really found his footing on this album (no pun intended).\n\nThe production, for the most part, is very fitting to this album. It's dirty, unpolished and gritty. Perfect ingredients to throw into a thrash album. That being said, there is one point where it fails on the album. \"Crypts of Eternity\" sees the production on the guitars thinning out. The guitars heaviness jumps up and down from thin, to heavy and back to thin again. It's not a huge issue, but it's enough to be noticeable and deserves mentioning. Otherwise, the production fits the songs and the evil atmosphere they were all going for. Also, the mix is fine. It showcase loud guitars and drums, which is great for this kind of album, but as previously mentioned, the bass is too quiet as a consequence of that. Again, it's not a major issue but it's big enough to warrant a mention.\n\nAll in all, Hell Awaits is an album that is oozing with filthy, vile thrash anthems with wicked lyrical themes. Slayer stepped up their game for this album and the end result was one that did not disappoint. The uncompromising speed, the more complex song structure and the much darker sound gave Slayer an identity to call their own, unlike Show No Mercy which tried to steal the identity of the NWOBHM bands. A thrash classic that every extreme metal fan needs to own.\n",
        "\nLet's come directly to the point: \"War Ensemble\", the first detonation of the fifth full-length of Slayer, is massively inspired by their greatest classic. A relentless neckbreaker with a length of almost five minutes, frightening guitars at the beginning, a combination of furious eruptions and mid-paced parts and an atmosphere of martial brutality - all these traits seem to be derived from \"Angel of Death\". But who has the power to resist his own success formula? Anyway, \"War Ensemble\" presents itself as a vehement opener and it comes close to the murderous quintessence of Slayer's early works. No doubt, the originators of three of the best thrash albums of all times are still able to compose and implement fanatic tracks. Yet it is also a fact that the divine aura of their signature song remains unrivalled. \"Angel of Death\" is the original, \"War Ensemble\" appears as the little brother with similar facial features. Thankfully, I like little brothers very much (my big sister takes a more differentiated view).\n\nHowever, the most impressive artwork of \"Seasons in the Abyss\" is the title track which finishes the album. The riffing commutes between desperation and devastation, an unholy aura is omnipresent and despite or exactly because of the rather leisurely rocking mid-tempo rhythm, the song possesses the right amount of heaviness. The oriental opening, the fairly catchy chorus and the general structure of the track leave a major impact. I recommend to watch the official video on YouTube, because the pyramids, the Sphinx, the desert and the \"strange\" people intensify the atmosphere of the song in a significant manner. Just as \"South of Heaven\", the title track does not reveal the typical features of Slayer's first albums. However, this closer takes the album on a good level. Only a \"good\" level? Unfortunately, the answer is yes. I hate to say it, but not much happens between the opener and the title track.\n\nWithout question, the thrash kings of the eighties can rely on their huge potential and they are not yet infected with modern ideas. Therefore, \"Seasons in the Abyss\" does not insult the listener with half-baked songs. Yet one cannot ignore that a certain number of pieces lacks of captivating details. Too many mid-paced parts show up. Of course, the title track provides evidence that Slayer have more to offer than merciless velocity. Nevertheless, the raging speed attacks have established the reputation of the band. It is therefore slightly annoying that Araya and the rest of the gang don't give a damn about their past. The result is that tracks like \"Expendable Youth\" or the anti-communistic \"Blood Red\" fail to make my blood boil. Speed eruptions such as \"Hallowed Point\" or \"Born of Fire\" are better, but it becomes clear that the adequate level of fury cannot be reached in view of the high number of mid-tempo breathers. The intensity of the first three albums has an intoxicating effect, but the here reviewed work spits on intensity, due to whatever reason. I don't say that the rather slow-moving creations lack of interesting riffs. In particular \"Skeletons of Society\" reveals a constantly rasping guitar work which constitutes the fundament for the good emergence of the song. But generally speaking, Hanneman's and King's compositions show unexpected variations in quality. In a nutshell, the eight songs between the opener and the closer are solid. No four-course menu, but also no cheap fast food. Some people say that \"Dead Skin Mask\" stands out due to its gloomy aura and the concise main riff, but I don't share this point of view. It is just another good song.\n\nFinally, the production cannot compete with those of the two predecessors. It goes without saying that it cannot be blamed for being blurred, thin or paltry. Yet the amazing degree of pressure and transparency is missing. This is a shame, because exactly this detail has ennobled both \"Reign in Blood\" and \"South of Heaven\", quite irrespective of the fact that their gargantuan third full-length has thousands of further advantages. With that said, let's face it. At the end of the day, it is sad but true: \"South of Heaven\" has shown the first cracks - and after this initial sign of dilapidation, right here and right now the monument of Slayer begins to crumble at an alarming pace. Well, the band still does not drop below an acceptable level. Despite the absence of a diabolic aura, \"Seasons in the Abyss\" is - I repeat: it definitely is - a good record, but it hovers light years away from the quality of Slayer's Holy Trinity which began with \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" and ended with \"Raining Blood\".\n",
        "\nHonestly speaking, \"South of Heaven\" was a disappointment. Back in 1988, it was really hard to accept this fact. Slayer had released three groundbreaking albums, supplemented by the fanatically blasting non-album jewel \"Chemical Warfare\". They were the absolute kings of thrash metal. From today's perspective, \"South of Heaven\" marked the beginning of a slow but steady downfall. 30 years after the publication of \"Reign in Blood\", the vast majority of thrash maniacs is still waiting for a worthy successor of this classic. Only a very few songs like the title track of their last album give hope for the future. What do you say? The terms \"Slayer\" and \"future\" do not fit together? Well, I guess that the self-declared experts discuss this topic very controversially.\n\nAs mentioned before, \"South of Heaven\" was a disappointment - but this does not mean that it was a bad album. The menacingly swelling title track clarified the titanic power of well designed mid-tempo tracks once and for all. Its ominous main riff quickly became an icon of slow-moving thrash metal. No doubt, this track had the weight of more than 1.000 tons and it left a gargantuan impact, although it differed from the tracks of \"Reign in Blood\" significantly. However, it is relatively easy to write a great song, but it is difficult to compose ten songs of the same quality. Furthermore, comparatively clean vocals can work occasionally, but they are no silver bullet. Just check out \"Behind the Crooked Cross\". In terms of music, this title did not lack of fury and obsession, but Araya's disinterested vocals caused a very ambivalent impression. Nevertheless, the A side of the vinyl proved that Slayer were still able to pen exciting songs. \"Silent Scream\" built the bridge to the previous works, \"Live Undead\" scored with captivating riffs and its steadily growing level of intensity, \"Mandatory Suicide\" offered an apocalyptic scenario, although it was - compared with the preceding eruptions - a rather undistinguished example of the compositional skills of the band. Anyway, one could not ignore a serious fact. The longer the album progressed, the more it became clear that it was not on a par with the first three full-lengths. The cardinal sin of the fourth output was the integration of the Judas cover version, at least from my point of view. To play a song of this fossilised dinosaur was like a very bad joke that gave me the feeling to listen to the following dialogue:\n\nThrash metal (with an awkward grin): \"Hello traditional metal. So far, I hated you. That was the reason why I always wanted to be something different. But now I see that it can make sense to move into your direction every now and then. Commercial aspects, I do not need to emphasize it, do not play a role!\"\nTraditional metal (precocious): \"My dear juvenile loudmouth, I don't understand. Explain to me how \"Silent Scream\" and \"Dissident Aggressor\" fit together.\"\nThrash metal (in a fit of pique): \"Don't ask me. It doesn't matter.\"\nTraditional metal: ... (speechless)\n\nDid I already say that \"South of Heaven\" was a disappointment? It failed to create this monolithic structure which had ennobled each and every of the first Slayer albums. One may explain this situation with the term \"development\". I don't agree. The first three albums also differed from each other in a remarkable way, but all of them were designed coherently. By contrast, the mixture of the heavyweight title track, the furious attacks like \"Silent Scream\", the lame cover version and the desperate \"Spill the Blood\" led to a torn and erratic overall appearance, at least to a certain extent. Apart from this surprisingly ill-defined approach, the tracks of the B side did not reach the exciting level for which the band was well known up till then. No, the songs did not reveal major flaws and yes, they had some good moments and well executed riffs. But any form of magic feeling was missing. Slayer had lost their godlike status from one second to the next. \"South of Heaven\" was nothing else but a good album that could also have been written by many other bands. Well, the perfect production was still a kind of unique selling point, but this alone did not create a milestone. I don't intend to make a mountain out of a molehill. Anyway, \"Reign in Blood\" had been a utopian vision which had come true, \"South of Heaven\" was a very profane product. Its slightly less brutal approach pointed in the wrong direction and gave cause for serious concerns. The worldwide Slayer community was getting nervous. Not without good reasons, as it was to turn out quickly.\n",
        "\nPlease excuse me for publishing this text, but I guess the review production of a thrash metal fan remains incomplete unless he has written some lines about \"Reign in Blood\". Honestly speaking, I had a lot of respect for this task, because it is hardly possible to find new aspects concerning this ultimate classic. Thus, I delved into the past. When I took a look at the review in the German RockHard magazine from the year 1986, I was surprised that the guy was writing about \"a mixture of hardcore and thrash\". From my point of view, the then modern hardcore (Crumbsuckers, Agnostic Front or S.O.D.) has nothing in common with the here reviewed outburst of energy. \"Reign in Blood\" is pure thrash metal, it is more or less the quintessence of this genre. Of course, punk (and hardcore) can be seen as an early stage of development in terms of vehement music and it is therefore a precursor of thrash. But if you agree that a certain amount of punk elements is inherent to the entire genre, then you will also share my conviction that \"Reign in Blood\" provides nothing else but undefiled thrash.\n\nDespite the opinion of a minority of fools, the third work of Slayer is not - and it was never - the fastest album of all times. High velocity plays a very important part, no doubt about it. Nevertheless, the band was also aware of the mightiness of well executed mid-tempo sections. \"Post Mortem\" is all I need to say. The brute riff of the verses hit the listener like a sledgehammer and the crushing song celebrated the mid-tempo approach in an almost homicidal manner. Even the most representative track of the album had a considerable mid-tempo part. You guessed it, I am talking about the upsetting \"Angel of Death\". Without losing its menacing aura, the probably most prominent track in the history of thrash metal slowed down after an extremely furious and barbaric start. The high-pitched scream of Tom Araya at the beginning indicated a level of hysteria which did not come true. Slayer showed their grimmest face, but they kept control and played their instruments with the highest precision instead of drifting into chaos. Anyway, the unbelievable sharpness of the riffs and the crystal clear production shaped one of the most intense listening experiences so far.\n\nFrom a German perspective, \"Angel of Death\" broke a taboo. To sing about the processes in Auschwitz without condemning the whole regime of the so-called F\u00fchrer at the same time was nothing less than an inexcusable mistake. Or it was just cold-blooded calculation, because the combination of the song, the moronic \"Slaytanic Wehrmacht\" merchandise and the \"Heydrich\" sticker on the guitar of Jeff Hanneman (R.I.P.) led to a very discussable picture. Hard to believe, but the controversy still goes on. The \"Zeit\", a respected paper for narcissistic academics and other eggheads, took the death of Hanneman as motivation to express its disgust about the lyrics of \"Angel of Death\" once again - 27 years after the publication of \"Reign in Blood\"! A good example for the German tendency to play the unpleasant know-it-all. Be that as it may, to break a taboo is always good promotion - and how many taboos have remained? Even in the eighties of the last century, many of them had already vanished into thin air. Thus, the Nazis and their cruelties were just too enticing. Well, the plan worked out. Nevertheless, the best arguments to dive deeply into the album were delivered by the music itself.\n\nUnrelenting, daring and breathtakingly exciting, \"Reign in Blood\" seemed to kill any kind of musical conventions. It would be a massive understatement to say that the full-length appeared as an acoustic battering ram. It was much more than this. The violent compositions benefitted from the perfect production that I mentioned before. Sound engineer Andy Wallace said that he loved dry, in-your-face aggressive rock, without tons of reverb. Consequently, he and Rick Rubin did not hesitate to realize the appropriate, electrifying mix. Their approach resulted in mega-aggressive, completely vile and ultra-vicious eruptions like \"Piece by Piece\", \"Necrophobic\" or \"Altar of Sacrifice\" which appeared as a nuclear bomb due to its extremely explosive beginning. These sonic documents of brutality developed the full force of their titanic riffs relentlessly. Admittedly, I could have mentioned the other tracks as well. The holistic album was a sonic orgy of blood and 29 minutes were enough time to erase each and every enemy, poser or random victim. It does not matter whether you listen to the ominous guitars at the beginning of the title track which lead to craggy riffs and sheer franticness or you lend an ear to the smooth yet murderous \"Epidemic\", because Slayer had penned spectacular killers without exception. As if that were not enough, the band achieved a tremendous technical level as well.\n\nI know, I am not alone with my opinion and maybe it is not an opinion at all but the simple truth: \"Reign in Blood\" is rather a dogma than a \"normal\" album. My personal favourite \"Hell Awaits\" has a more diabolic aura, but from an objective point of view and with regard to its undisputed relevance, the here reviewed work probably constitutes the mother of all thrash albums. The likelihood is low that somebody can convincingly explain why exactly this full-length became the showpiece of the sub genre. And that is no surprise, because real art has always a magic touch. Too bad that Slayer were not able to preserve the chemistry which was crucial for the creation of this overwhelming milestone.\n",
        "\nThis album really shows the failings and limitations of thrash as an art form. It isn't something that you can just keep doing forever as you get older and older. Slayer on Repentless are touting this as a return to form, in presentation and aesthetics and the music itself, but how is that even possible? All the good things about Slayer came from their youth \u2013 the extremity was the kind that all the best thrash bands had, bestowed upon them by that young, angry zeal and desire to go further than the bands before them had. The lyrics were about Satan and serial killers and Nazi war crimes, and they were presented as what they were, shock tactics to go along with the racy, over the top, extreme music. On here, you get the same thrashy beats, the same machine-gun riffing and Tom Araya's bellowing over top, but it all sounds passe and try-hard when coming from a bunch of dudes in their 50s.\n\nEverything about this is just old sounding. The band sounds fine, but they lack the riotous energy of their youth. And the sound itself is not extreme anymore; the lyrics have nothing new to say, so that has also lost its luster, and even then, a 30-year career full of offensive fuck-you lyrics about war, politics and being angry is kind of stretching it. Nobody is really that angry. On Repentless we get a bunch of technically sound, clean songs that are reasonably aggressive for such old metallers. Nothing is entirely unpleasant, and sometimes you get a decent thrashy rollicking instrumental section, but there's really nothing here you can't get better on Reign in Blood for the faster bits and South of Heaven for the slower bits. Tom Araya sounds pretty awful in parts, and hearing him try for the higher notes now is just kind of embarrassing. The production is super sterile and clean and boring. I even liked the way-too-loud World Painted Blood production better than this.\n\nSo then we reach the conundrum \u2013 what to do about Slayer? Clearly, expecting them to retire and pack it up just because they're old now is a ridiculous thing to expect. They're making money and they probably like what they do, and they have a ton of fans. They won't retire just because we say it sucks. But as I said before, this kind of balls-out, energized thrash doesn't work when the band gets old. Thrash is a brightly burning spark that quickly is snuffed out by age and complacency in one's life \u2013 you can't keep that going forever. Its one purpose is to be aggressive and heavy as fuck, and when a band like Slayer's older material clearly out-performs their new stuff on that one tunnel-vision goal, what's the point? Slayer will keep going, but their limited scope and seeming unwillingness to write fresher-sounding music to combat their audibly older age renders them pretty irrelevant. But they won't stop, so any review saying this is basically screaming in space: no one who matters will hear you.\n\nIn effect, am I saying Slayer's career is pointless now? Pretty much. There's nothing to say about Repentless, so I suppose that in and of itself is a good enough conclusion here.\n",
        "\nStill maintaining the thrash element, but here is 'God Hates Us All' revisited. Even that album I have more respect for than this, mainly because of Hanneman, but also because on both guitarist's fronts, their leads were still good. The rhythms on this one are along the same paths, with a tint of clean guitar pieces, though not much. I'm driving at the fact that without the key ingredient to the songwriting i.e. Slayer of the olden days, 'Repentless' falls short. There is that aggression that still exists in the band, but let's face it, Hanneman and Lombardo were the core to Slayer's unique sound and energy which hasn't been the same since (I think) 'Seasons in the Abyss'. I say this because to me that's their last good album.\n\n'Repentless' I was skeptical about especially after hearing the song \"Implode\" before the CD was released to the public. I thought that it was a pretty generic tune. Holt tries to mimic the Hanneman's sound on his leads, but no one was as unique in the lead department for Slayer except Jeff. I remember reading an interview in the early 90's where Jeff stated that the albums show which leads are whose because he didn't want people to think his were thought of or mistaken to be King's. Not to digress, but not only is 'Repentless' generic on the rhythm guitar aspect, King is absolutely horrible in his total lack of effort in the lead front. Let's face it, Slayer should in my opinion just retire. My favorites were those of the earlier days. Old Slayer is dead, long live old Slayer!\n\nAraya hasn't been the same since 'Reign in Blood', on there I think and on 'Show No Mercy' were his best vocals. Yes, on 'Repentless' his voice does go good with the guitars, but the band's ability to write memorable songs is totally lacking. I'd go so far to say that Slayer reigned best from 'Show No Mercy' all the way to 'Seasons in the Abyss'. After that, they went rancid. Not having Lombardo behind the kit you hear Paul's snare drum with a \"popping\" sound to it along with a total lack of effort on his part here on 'Repentless'. There were some albums he did with Slayer that were mediocre. On here, he's just burnt out. His drum lines don't show or could ever be as creative as Dave was with Slayer. I have total dislike for Paul.\n\nThere's really nothing that sets 'Repentless' apart from Slayer's discography, only that it's among the realm of their worst releases, even worse than 'World Tainted Blood' and 'Christ Illusion'. Even though Jeff was still live and on those albums, they still reeked of putrefaction. People that say that 'Repentless' is \"not bad\" are the people that praise Slayer's newer material versus their old. There isn't a song on here that I liked. I thought the whole album was crap. There's nothing significant about it, only that it is praised by this 21st century listeners of Slayer, not the 20th century ones who are alive to hear me compare their older material all the way up until present day. \n\nThis is bad music -- it totally lacks in the creative aspect of the band's writing and King should just wrap it up with his leads. None of the music is really significant or memorable. Nothing like Jeff's older riffs. Holt is a good guitar player and replacement, but he tries to mirror what he thought Jeff would approve of but to me he's not as good. A lot wah pedal use by both guitarists in their leads, mostly by Kerry. My score is in the \"D\" range because I don't think that they totally flopped out. I just think they could've spent more time focusing on the music and the lyrics Slayer has never been good at writing. The one good thing I'll say is at least they didn't change their thrash roots.\n\nThis 21st century Slayer doesn't really contribute to the ingenious qualities that were so prevalent in their earlier days. In my opinion, I stopped liking them after 'Seasons in the Abyss'. Not that they didn't put out decent work in the 90's, it's just their ideas sort of ran out and even Jeff's and Kerry's leads were predictable. 'Repentless' doesn't have much to offer unless you had a musical lobotomy and praised it for something that it is not. The production quality was okay, just Rick Rubin was their best producer I think. Tom still has the yelling going on in the songs, some of the rhythms written were just \"ok\", Kerry's lead's were horrendous and Paul's drumming totally lacked ingenuity and precision. Don't get this, get their earlier work if you don't have it already!\n",
        "\nLet me say this right away, when Slayer went out to write \"Reign in Blood\" they were young, angry, disenfranchised young men. What you will hear on this record is intense, precise, maniacal thrash metal done just right. While Metallica were putting beautiful melodic passages in their thrash metal magnum opus \"Master of Puppets\" Slayer went out said fuck it, were going straight for the jugular. The result of that is some of the fastest, most intense, and lethal dose of thrash you will ever hear. A bonus to this vicious thrash metal masterpiece is also the great production by Rick Rubin. Listening to the album again it hasn't aged a bit in almost 30 years. It still has a very very good sound to it, it's not like \"Darkness Descends\" where everything is drowned out and sounds very muddy. Nope, this album has a crystal clear sound. It still sounds better than lots of metal records coming out today. Rick Rubin did a fantastic job on this record. On the guitars you could hear every note even if their playing at a million miles an hour, the drums sound amazing with the great Dave Lombardo providing very aggressive drumming. The bass while not very prominent compared to the guitars is still heard.\n\nThe instrumentation on this record is savage. Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King's riffs are incredibly catchy while being very good as well. Their solos are some of the fastest and most chaotic guitar solos I've ever heard in my lifetime. They are also very influential on death metal guitarists (examples: The Hoffman brothers from Deicide, Jack Owen from Cannibal Corpse). On this album there are no \"melodic\" or \"pretty sounding\" solos, there all mind numbingly fast and chaotic, they also push what is considered music (\"Raining Blood\" solo for example). Dave Lombardo's drumming is flat out destruction. His double bass playing is so fast I wonder how he didn't pull his leg muscles doing so. His ability to keep the beat is amazing as well, also his drum style is very innovative and very creative as well. Tom Araya's bass playing isn't as well heard as King or Hanneman's guitar dueling he still does a good job supporting the brutal riffs and solos. His vocals though are vicious. He sings the lyrics with such brimming hatred and energy he makes the lyrics believable. \n\nOn \"Reign in Blood\" there are no weak or bad songs. Only good, exceptional, and great. The exceptional tracks are obviously going to be \"Angel of Death\" and the title track. When I first heard these songs I fell in love instantly. There is a reason they are always featured in Slayer's live set and another reason those two are their most well known songs, it's because those songs are just that good. The great songs are \"Criminally Insane,\" \"Jesus Saves,\" and \"Postmortem\" while great songs on their own right, they are not outstanding compared to the previous two tracks I mentioned, while the rest of the songs are good.\n\nWhile Slayer may have aged like rotting cheese today, this album will always be remembered and praised by legions of metal heads and slayer fans alike. This album will always hold a dear place in my heart for its influence, its memorability, and crystal clear production.\n",
        "\nHow could they recover? With neither glibness nor morbid curiosity in my tone, I ask that question again: how could they recover? The loss of Mr. Hanneman seemed like one that would be so damning as to cause the foundation of Slayer's structure to collapse (due in no small part to his being a better guitarist and songwriter than his shaven-head colleague), but through sheer will or a refusal to bow out (dis)gracefully the group continued to soldier on. Yet an aura of uncertainty surrounded the group in the years that followed, even with Gary Holt stepping in to lend a hand (which, in itself, added another uncertain layer to the band's future, one that is still in effect; \"will he leave Exodus to play in Slayer full time?\" \"No??\" \"Yes??\" \"Maybe???\"), and though we knew a new album was coming, it's still not clear whether or not this is one last bow before the breakup that really should happen if you ask me, or a sign of further existence down the line...\n\nAnd speaking of this new work, I will say this; it's clear that Hanneman was the superior songwriter of the main guitarist duo given how \"Repentless\" came out. That said, however, it's still a decently performed, halfway good (at best) album that maintains the same solid foundation the band has had lo these many generations and trends, yet sadly falls short of what we really hoped it to be as it starts out with energy to spare and dies out as everything progresses. If nothing else, it showcases the limitations of King's \"shoot first, ask questions later\" method of dynamicless songwriting; think of it as a marathon runner who has the wrong idea on how to run said marathon. He thinks of it as a race and attempts to be the hare when the tortoise is what keeps you on your feet throughout the run, and after his sprint-a-thon he collapses well short of the finish line. That's \"Repentless\" in and of itself. But that first initial burst of energy is still quite entertaining and far more enjoyable than plenty of you out there have made it out to be. The first few times the album lets you have it are almost as intense as the band we knew and loved, with much of that genuine grace coming from the energetic performance, the sharp and crystalline production, and even Mr. Araya's vocal work, which sounds more wild and angry than they have in a long time. He may no longer be the Antichrist stalking the shadows, but if all you can be a guy you don't want being in your face shouting the way he does, then things can be much worse. The rhythm section is taught and plenty focused, the drumming simply good for the most part (which is a shame, seeing as Mr. Bostoph always came off as a more dynamic and intense drummer than Lombardo...come at me, Blood Reigners!!) and Gary Holt's contributions breathe some fine, new life into the lead work, giving unto us the first album in which some of the solos are good and fully actualized! It only took 'em 30+ years. Ah well, better late than never, I suppose.\n\nAll that said, this is by no means a perfect album, and as I'd spoken of earlier there's only so much you can take in when all you get is bashing speed and the parts within aren't as realized as they need to be. One can get tired of being repeatedly struck with several blindlingly fast objects (by the time you get to \"Implode\" you may begin to gaze more and more at your watch), and even when things slow into a crawl with hopes of providing some dark and demented atmosphere it almost feels like it doesn't belong; not coerced or pigeon-holed so much as originally unwelcome yet begrudgingly accepted, if that makes any kind of sense, Were tracks like \"When the Stillness Comes\" to percolate a bit more on the fire and flesh out into a more accessible degree we'd be reminded the true evil that Slayer used to possess back when they had something to say that didn't involve \"fuck\" every few verses. In that regard, I can't stay silent despite how poor form it is for a reviewer to attack the lyrical work; I can't say I've been the biggest fan of Slayer's attempts at bro-style antagonism, especially given how ghastly and wicked this artwork and booklet shape come off as, but in this day and era, with the ages the creative forces are, it feels all the more sad to the point where it's almost pathetic. There comes a time in your life when you have to put down the angst, stop flipping off the camera and unleash your rage in the most \"act your age!\" way possible. But maybe they can't do that? Maybe Kerry is still a bitchy teen at heart? Sometimes it seems that way given his many brushes with journalists and his general view on things s a whole. it must be so tiring being in a world so pissy. But I digress...\n\nIn the end, \"Repentless\" was a bit of a disappointment but not quite the crater in the ground many fans claim it to be. Trust me, Slayer's done much worse in their career (\"Diabolos...\", anyone?), but if this proves to be their final offering which, in a perfect world, this would be, they could have done better. Average at best, middling at worst. So it goes.\n",
        "\nIf you were to listen to Slayer fans today, God Hates Us All, released on September 11, 2001, was the real terrorist attack that day, ravaging the twin towers of old-school thrash and new-school groove. And while thousands of people didn\u2019t lose their lives with this release, Slayer fans died on the inside, knowing that their beloved band was on a path to ruin.\n\nBut is God Hates Us All all that bad? My personal answer is no. So it\u2019s not Reign in Blood, I\u2019ll grant it that much, but the sheer anger and hatred spewing out of Araya\u2019s mouth and through some of the riffing is ripe enough for me to stand up and acknowledge that there is some ferocity here, and the energy of the music can pump up my inflatable girlfriend. I can understand that this is not for everyone, and I can also see where Slayer fans of old might point an accusing finger at this, since it is in some ways a departure from the pure thrash roots they pioneered many years prior.\n\nFor one thing, this is a highly vocal-centric album. Sure, the riffs are there, but the main focus point is Araya\u2019s yelling vocals. They are loud and inescapable. Good thing is that I don\u2019t mind, and his clear diction means I can yell along with him. Everyone knows his proclivity for the F-word, so I find this album in particular a good release of curse words when I\u2019m in that mood and I feel like swearing at my laptop screen. Slayer lyrics have been a mixed bag by critics, and I doubt this one will change that viewpoint. Songs such as \u201cExile\u201d and, more obviously \u201cPayback\u201d utilise Slayer\u2019s favourite four-letter word, while others like \u201cDeviance\u201d have none, so there\u2019s some kind of balance there, if that makes any difference.\n\nThe thrash influence is still there, but they\u2019ve grooved it up. The opening riff of \u201cCast Down\u201d shows this \u2013 half-thrash, half-groove riffs before the mid-paced main riff enters afterwards. God Hates Us All is full of these sorts of riffs, for better or worse. Some cool solos are littered around the place, like in \u201cDisciple\u201d and \u201cExile.\u201d They\u2019re not mind-blowing, but I think they fit in where they go. As a thrash record, there\u2019s probably not enough for fans to cling on to, which likely contributes to the poor reception God Hates Us All receives. For what it\u2019s worth, the included solos are good and are well placed. Bostaph\u2019s drumming is loud \u2013 much louder than the guitars \u2013 and overpowers everything except the vocals. It\u2019s a shame due to the fact that some of the riffing here is worthy of centre stage. That might be difficult to comprehend for those that pine for the 80\u2019s material, but personally that would\u2019ve been beneficial here.\n\nTheir schtick here is anger, groove, and mid-paced thrash. The frustrating thing is that it works sometimes, and other times it doesn\u2019t. \u201cGod Send Death\u201d is much too slow. It\u2019s slightly meandering and needed some more speed to it. Perhaps the fact that it\u2019s sandwiched between two much better tracks doesn\u2019t help its cause, but I feel if it was faster, I would\u2019ve enjoyed it more. \u201cBloodline\u201d is the weakest song here, due to, again, how slow it is, the weak lyrics, and the lazy riffs. It relinquishes the energy created by a bunch of songs created before it. \u201cDeviance\u201d continues this sort of blas\u00e9 song writing. The vocals are not as menacing, the clean guitars in the background don\u2019t particularly fit, and the song is overall too tiring.\n\nOn the other hand, the same formula works when the vocals are pissed and the music is even just slightly sped up. Everything from \u201cNew Faith\u201d to \u201cExile\u201d are great songs. They might not be thrashy, but the power is in Araya\u2019s lyrics and vocals. \u201cWar Zone\u201d is the fastest song on offer here and I can\u2019t help but scream \u201cWAR ZOOOONE! WAR ZOOOONE!\u201d when it pummels me. Similarly, \u201cPayback\u201d might be the least ambiguous song of the lot, but it\u2019s a really fun song to listen to, especially when I\u2019m pissed off. The Slayer formula with these songs absolutely works, and for these reasons does not deserve its unrelenting scorn.\n\nIt does deserve some criticism, though. The first half is ultimately superior; only \u201cGod Send Death\u201d is weak in the first seven tracks, but after that only \u201cWar Zone\u201d and \u201cPayback\u201d are really worth it. There\u2019s many good points here, deserving much more praise than given, but there\u2019s other parts where the same formula misses. Ultimately, though, God Hates Us All is a vocally-based album with less importance on the riffs themselves, and more upon the emotion evoked through the music as a whole (mostly anger, obviously). Not for everyone, but I can get behind some of the hate here.\n\nPayback\u2019s a bitch, motherfucker!\n",
        "\nIs there really any reason to review 'Reign in Blood' anymore? Apart from the fact that 'Altar of Sacrifice' is making me type real fast right now, the public view of this album is well-known and surely nothing new can be said on the subject. Right? Either this is the most technically amazing, brutally punishing, and fucking fastest slab of metal ever or it's a disorganized mess of 6-string masturbation, excessive tempos, and Tom Araya shouting. I'm not really going to spend much time exploring either of those views, though suffice it to say that both have their merits, as reflected by my rating; instead I want to explore the implications of the blatancy with which 'Reign in Blood' goes for the jugular throughout almost every second of its piddly 29-minute runtime.\n\nThere is more than one type of metalhead. Some of us listen to this kind of music because it represents our take on reality or allows us to truly speak our minds, some of us wish to escape from reality, some of us go to metal for a representation of brutality and animal instinct, some of us want to open our minds and marvel at the artistry, some of us just think metal is fun to listen to. Probably, you can place yourself into more than one of those categories, and that's perfectly reasonable, but I want to question which category you would place Slayer in. When thinking about 'Reign in Blood', I think almost everyone is thinking of number 3 - brutality and vicious tendencies. There's a chance that you've just pointed to number 5 as well - this album is a lot of fun. Then, considering it for a moment more, perhaps there's some scope for 1 and 2, while the musicianship is up there, especially the speed, so number 4 is also an option. However, I'm not really sure. The producers and consumers of thrash metal actually have a very small window of success to aim for and - while on some level, 'Reign in Blood' is a satisfying thrash album - it is too extreme an example of thrash metal to be considered only as such. What we're getting into here is something almost entirely separate from the music, which is art.\n\nI can imagine that about 80% of readers have just clicked away from this review at the mention of art, so if you're still reading, well done, because it's you I want to talk to. Have you ever been to a visual art gallery (like with paintings and stuff) and seen some impressionist art or modern sculpture and thought, \"What the fuck is that?\" The exhibit just looks like nothing in particular and seems pointless: it's not a face, not even one of Picasso's faces, because you know those are art; it's not a landscape or a body or a situation; it's not even really a proper thing, it's just a shape. You're confused and disappointed, maybe even angry at the purposelessness of the artwork; you feel like you've been cheated; you say to yourself, \"I could do that.\" The point of all this stuff about museums (and all the italics) is that 'Reign in Blood' is more or less that kind of artwork, though within the limited confines of thrash metal, it doesn't shock to quite the same degree, since Slayer couldn't have made an album that was just noise, because then no one would have bought it, they would have lost all their fans and that would have been the end of the band. Slayer pushed thrash metal roughly to its boundaries and, arguably, few bands have gone past that point since, not without plummetting away down the toilet to an unmarked piss-soaked grave.\n\nThe reason why it's so difficult to say that 'Reign in Blood' is art is because heavy metal is already a contest of extremity, whereby being more extreme than the next band is in fact one of the main objectives and one indicator of a band's success. However, thrash metal is a strictly policed genre and anyone daring to venture outside the narrow realms of fast down-picked riffs, double bass drumming, lightning leads, and grim lyrics is likely to be outcast. As such 'Reign in Blood' is a certain product of thrash metal, but it is at the outer edge, where songs like 'Necrophobic', 'Reborn', and 'Raining Blood' start to lose their musicality, that Slayer are testing the fabric of their field. This is an experiment in endurance, an investigation into the point where music becomes noise, and an impressionist representation of mental and physical chaos. This is not to say that these artistic facets of the album were an entire success, since I strongly believe that Slayer hedged their bets too much to make either a great thrash album or a great work of art, but both can be seen in 'Jesus Saves', where the atmospheric build-up gives way to churning riffage and ear-bleeding solos.\n\nThis part of Slayer's endeavour achieves medium success, while the songs also satisfy only in part. The long middle section of the album (from 'Piece by Piece' until 'Epidemic') is much more abstract and theoretical than musically rewarding, although the intensity and vicious riffwork still offers plentiful rewards; however, it is the legendary opener and the steadier 'Postmortem' that leave a lasting impact, proving that the more traditional side of Slayer still maintained its original appeal. As such, listening to 'Reign in Blood' in a mildly troubling experience (not including the harrowing lyrics) due to the essential duality of the songs, part metaphor and part literal music as they are. My problem with this album is thus not far from that of others, but my complaint is somewhat different. If Slayer had made an entire album in the vein of 'Angel of Death' and 'Postmortem', it would stand as one of the best representations of the thrash metal genre, whereas if they had completed the theoretical barbed wire enema of the shorter, uglier songs, we might have had an unappealing yet philosophically comprehensive work of art that would be renowned for a totally different reason - as an enquiry into the nature of music. As it is, we have to make do with a little of both.\n",
        "\nComing off the success of their classic speeder Reign In Blood, Slayer decided to take things in a new direction by slowing down their approach and making their songs heavier. What we got out of that was South of Heaven and how does it hold up?\n\nHonestly, going into this album the first time I thought that I would hate it. I\u2019m of the opinion that Reign in Blood was the best album ever, which I know is as predictable as the sun rising in the morning, but I think people can understand it. Be that as it may, this album surprised me. What I got was a surprisingly good album with many memorable songs and catchy riffs. There were also a few stinkers on there as well but I feel that\u2019s par for the course on any album. \n\nThis new approach is immediately impactful on the opening title track, that haunting intro to the album sets it up nicely only to smack the listener in the face with a mid tempo thrasher. As the first song I heard off the album, it sounded great. The lyrics, screaming of an immoral human race, stand out more than anything and it\u2019s really cathartic to sing along with them. And there are many other songs that use this slowed down approach to great effect. \u201cMandatory Suicide\u201d and \u201cDissident Aggressor\u201d immediately jump to mind, the former for its catchy riff and vocals, I feel this is the best vocal performance Tom has given, and the latter for being a great cover song overall. Kind of disappointed that Tom didn\u2019t try for the high screams but it\u2019s not a major issue. \u201cBehind the Crooked Cross\u201d can be a fun time if I\u2019m in the right mood, its beat is generic but energising and Tom\u2019s vocals sound kind of bored but I like it because of the heavy guitars, especially in the chorus. Despite these new slower songs, Slayer still are packing that speed that made them famous, but \u201cSilent Scream\u201d is the only song that speeds from start to finish. The rest weave in and out of faster and slower parts of the song, which I feel keeps the songs fresh so one riff doesn\u2019t get too stale. \n\nBut don't get me wrong, there are the bad songs. \u201cLive Undead\u201d is a mediocre mess, the intro is nice but the rest sounds tired and bored, especially the vocals. In fact, the vocals in general aren\u2019t great. I like Tom\u2019s performance on \"Mandatory\" because it\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever heard him come to actual singing, but the rest is either hit or miss, and \"Live Undead\" was a colossal misfire. It sounds more spoken word than sung and even gets to the point where Tom sounds like he\u2019s drooling the words out. But my worst song on this record would have to be \u201cSpill the Blood\u201d. I appreciate trying out new things but this is not what I have in mind when I think Slayer. The melodic nature is nice, but I feel as if it\u2019s too melodic. I know that may be a weak argument and sound like I\u2019m trying to cling to the past, but my point is, if this thing in front of me is being sold to me as a Slayer record, I expect to hear Slayer. I do not hear Slayer in \u201cSpill the Blood\u201d.\n\nThe production is\u2026 meh. I like how the drums are pushed way up in the mix and the sound of them is nice and of course it\u2019s great, it\u2019s Dave Lombardo performing, he always delivers. His little improvisations between beats are always refreshing, which is especially evident on \u201cGhosts of War\u201d. The guitars jump up and down in quality. Sometimes they\u2019re loud and keep that Slayer aggression that I love, but every so often I can\u2019t hear them, which for a metal album, is a bit of a downer. I don\u2019t think I need to explain the vocals, I\u2019ve made my opinion on them quite clear. The mix itself is really well done, even on tracks like \u201cSpill the Blood\u201d and \u201cLive Undead\u201d I can tell that this is the best way to mix those tracks, they sound natural and, had they been worked on a bit more, I would probably like them.\n\nAll round, South of Heaven is a solid album. It has its ups and downs but the ups easily outweigh the downs. The few problems I have with this album aren\u2019t major things and the bad songs are few and far between. As far as Slayer records go, you can get much worse than this.\n\nStandout tracks: Silent Scream, Mandatory Suicide, Ghosts of War\n\nWeakest tracks: Live Undead, Spill the Blood\n",
        "\nAfter hearing the initial single \"Repentless\" I heard the obligatory \"F-word\" being yelled about and immediately figured that Slayer, once again, had forgone clear and intelligent lyrical thought in favor of the nu-metal Slipknot plasticity that has permeated the band's sound for the last 14-years since God Hates Us All. That said, as a fan since 1983 I figured I had to at least give the album a shot for posterity's sake.\n\nAfter social media exploded with an incredible torrent of \"Slayer's back!\" posts I sat down and took in Repentless and honestly went in with an indelibly open mindset. Despite abandoning the sinking ship many years ago, the ghosts of my youth and the driving need to hang on to those apparitions compelled me to at least give it another go. What I hear is an aging group that sounds the \"best\" they've sounded since the aforementioned 2001 monstrosity, but whether that actually means anything is another story.\n\nOkay, let's take this slowly. Does this album have \"moments?\" Sure, it has spotty aspects of older-school Slayer (the slippery-slope 1990 school era, that is) where your head invariably bobs to the incessant thumping of the now typical Slayer beat. You might also feel that rush when Tom Araya starts yelling during \"Repentless\" because his commanding scolding tone is one of Slayer's defining traits. All of these little familiarities aside, one of the elements that has destroyed Slayer for me in the past two decades is the seemingly biblical overuse of the coveted \"F\" word...like every sixth word. For me, that showcased a total lack of ideas and an even greater lack of respect for the audience. Yes, I fully understand we metal fans are purported to be a segmented, aggressive lot that can appreciate such volatile words to serve as verbal exclamation points in even casual conversation. However, I choose to believe that the greater populous of our movement is intelligent folks looking for some real mental entanglements to keep the interest fresh and the cerebral copulation memorable. Slayer lets the overt aggression dictate the blueprint, and that made for some very basic and formulaic music. This album is happily devoid of such expletive-laced plasticity, but it does suffer from some very watered-down lyrics. During \"Vices\" I'm treated to Araya imploring me to get high off the ultimate drug (violence), and for a brief moment I thought my eyes would actually flip Vegas odds with all of the freewheel rolling they did. Still and all, it's better than that horrid 2001 album where I thought Slipknot might have commandeered the studio for a few days, but I digress.\n\nMuch of this album simply fails to interest me enough to call anything on here a classic; those days are long gone after 1986's \"Reign in Blood,\" the long-revered staple for the band. Let's face it: Slayer is older, yes, and their fan base is almost stupidly loyal to a fault, but when ideas run stale, they're simply past accepted expiration. This album is not horrible by any means, and it's a definitive 'step up' considering that I feel the last 14-years to be a severely unfunny joke, but there's a definite air of spoiled milk in the room. I think the music, punchy in areas, albeit mundane, simply falls short in the natural aggression area, saying nothing for the aforementioned trite lyrical prowess that is years past any prime. I can fondly recall being a tremulous wreck awaiting a new Slayer album; now I'm merely an old fart that, according to the social media milieu, simply doesn't get it or is simply \"being a hater.\" I didn't know a lifelong dedication to this band ending with a sincere disappointment in their obvious lack of concerted effort qualified me as something horribly opaque as a \"hater,\" but that's neither here nor there. \n\nSome of the bright spots herein are \"Repentless,\" \"Atrocity Vendor,\" \"You Against You\" and \"Pride in Prejudice\" simply due to their closest possible relation to any semblance of old Slayer. I was convinced that sound was long gone along with Metallica's roots and Megadeth's godless edge, and by and large it is, but there were, as I said, moments of stubborn nostalgia. Sadly, those trips down crumbled walkways of memory lane are too lurid and wayward to impose on the recesses of my brain and heart for very long. I consider this a long-lost friend still criminally missing. Forget the fact that drummer Dave Lombardo is now persona non grata and founding guitarist Jeff Hannemann is, in Kerry King's eloquent words, \"worm food.\" The truth is, they were slipping long before these two men left for other pastures, and truths so hard and fast are tough to deny. They're even tougher to flee. \n\nAs I said, what we have here is an older band holding on to an apologetic fanbase too stubborn or blinded by mock dedication to call out mediocrity where it defiantly sits, currently raking in the Nuclear Blast bucks with lots of pretty colored vinyl on the way and a nifty metal box set shaped like an eagle that will set you back nearly $200USD. Often uninspired and overly forced in spots, Repentless is an unassuming dribble down the chin and into the bib of old age as opposed to the mid-80's loogie-splattering phlegm expectorated into the shocked faces of the established order. It's easily wiped away into the abyss of a soiled tissue. This is the tragedy of getting old; we all do it and some of us know when to give up the ghosts of our youth. \n\nI grow fatigued hearing the same rallying cries from uninformed newbies and dedicated band logo fans of how Slayer is \"...at least better than Megadeth and Metallica.\" When you have three piles of excrement at your feet, one a month old, one a week old, and the last freshly expelled, you can turn blue in the face fighting for the bragging rights as to which pile smells the least offensive - shit is still shit, despite rare spots of fragrant familiarity in a strong wind. \n\n(Originally written for www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nI think we all agree that \"Undisputed Attitude\" is Slayer's most exceptional album. Its concept is questionable. Even almost 20 years after the release, I am still slightly confused about the offering of \"Gemini\", that does not fit into the scheme. It seems as if Slayer did not trust their own concept. Or - worse still - they wanted to create an additional purchase incentive at the expense of their integrity. \"Yes, we want to cover raw and violent punk classics. But come on, let us at least take one new Slayer track so that everybody has to buy the album, if he wants to have a complete Slayer collection\" - this was seemingly their train of thought. To add insult to injury, the slow-moving \"Gemini\" stands in sharp contrast to the other songs and it does not reach the expected level of aggression and velocity. The solid but fairly weary composition fails to enrich the catalogue of Slayer sustainably.\n\nApart from this minor conventional flaw, the band cannot be blamed for half-heartedness. Slayer have internalized the spirit of the songs and they express it in a furious manner. An acoustic amok run reminds us that the fucked up universe also knows good extreme music which cannot be labelled as metal. I freely admit that the pretty harmless Ramones are the only punk band that I really love. By the way, their best track is \"Garden of Serenity\" from \"Halfway to Sanity\". But that is another story. I just want to say that I am no expert for punk music and I do not know the original tunes. This said, the here presented attacks have absolutely nothing in common with the musical approach of the forefathers of punk. The songs barrel along as if there is no tomorrow. Even if the band slows down the pace, the aura of stubborn resistance stays the same. Song titles such as \"Guilty of Being White\", \"Violent Pacification\" or \"Richard Hung Himself\" show impressively that Slayer know how to play the game of provocation. And I do not think that we have to discuss about these lyrics. From my point of view, they should not and cannot be taken seriously.\n\nThe adrenaline rush seems to be unstoppable. After having performed the first high velocity eruptions, the band does not get out of breath and the level of harshness remains unaffected. For example, \"Spiritual Law\" is one of the most intense orgies of the album, although it has a mid-paced middle part. Furthermore, it is remarkable that this song, as well as the majority of the other tunes, considers the necessary amount of melody lines. The crude authors of the original versions knew their business. Compared with their working results, the two punk-influenced creations of Jeff Hanneman (R.I.P.) do not leave a lasting impression. To play punk songs means more than killing your instrument within 90 seconds.\n\nDespite the forceful and mainly clean sound, the album transmits the crusty character of typical hardcore / punk eruptions. Tom Araya's vocal performance is an important component in this context. He sounds less demonic than on the regular albums. Instead, he seems to scream permanently \"piss off\", while using mysteriously other words for that friendly invitation. Anyway! \"Undisputed Aggression\" has its own charm. Enjoy slayerized punk anthems and don't give a damn about the political - or naive? - lyrics. This is punk! (As a marginal note: the second CD offers three live tracks, among other things a cover version of Venom. Nice, but unspectacular.)\n",
        "\nBefore this album ever came out people were already dismissing it due to the absence of drummer Dave and the death of Jeff. So it came as no surprise to myself when the album finally released that it was meet with such hostility. But in reality this truly is a slayer album, just take a listen to the title track \"Relentless\". As it starts with a lighting fast riff, with a drums that kicks you're face in. Followed by Tom's signature shouting vocals. Yes there is no doubt that this song try's to bring back the rage and aggressiveness from Reign In Blood, and it doesn't really accomplish this, but nevertheless it's a hell of a track. \n\nThe album keeps the speed up through the first couple of tracks. Things don't change until you reach \"When The Stillness Comes\" when things get slowed down. With a clean guitar intro this song gets the creepy vibe going, making you feel like you're sitting in dark room but you can't shake the feeling you're not alone. This is also the first song that we really get to hear Tom's thunderous bass, and it's glorious. The serial killer lyrics only help to make this one of the best tracks on the album. \n\nThe second half of the album doesn't regain the speed the first half did, but it does get heavier. With tracks like: Chasing Death, Piano Wire, Atrocity Vendor, and You Against You. All these tracks are mid-tempo thrashers, with thick guitar tones, groove oriented drumming, and more signature slayer trade off solos. The best example is Piano Wire, this track from start to finish demands you head bang like crazy. With A slow chugging riff, to the ever thunderous drumming to Tom yelling the lyrics at you, it quickly becomes a deadly tack, and I could easily see people moshing while this song plays live.\n\nNow that I'm done praising Repentless, this album does have its flaws. A big one is the absence of Tom's bass. Not to say its not there but for most of the album its buried in the mix. Another thing that hinders the album are the lyrics. The lyrics can feel a little juvenile on songs like Vices, and Implode. With lines like \"violence is the ultimate drug/ lets get high!\" can almost make you laugh. But all these things aside, this album does have some strong songs. In short, Repentless has it flaws, but can still be worthwhile.\n",
        "\nTo introduce Slayer would be carrying coals to Newcastle. Let us therefore rush headfirst into \"Repentless\". It was a very questionable dissemination policy to release four single songs before the full-length was placed on the market. And, of course, the best tune (the title track) was released just eight weeks before the publication date of the album in order to herald a new masterpiece of Slayer. The industry seems to believe that we are all stupid children who do not know its thinking and the consequential mechanisms. Be that as it may, it comes as no surprise that the title track stands out. It represents exactly that kind of Slayer which I enjoy. The song is neither innovative nor surprising, but the band is in its element. The neckbreaking old school riffing is driven by the precisely whipping drums and Tom Araya's voice transmits this diabolic vibration which shaped so many classics of the band. \"Repentless\" goes its way straightforwardly, simply irresistibly and without suffering from modern influences. Give me this song and I give you the entire \"World Painted Blood\" album - this would be really a good deal (albeit only for me). \n\nBut Slayer quickly relapse. A lot of rather slow parts take their toll with the effect that Araya, King and their prominent sidekicks are not able to maintain the fury of the title track. I freely admit that their best album (\"Hell Awaits\") also did not lack of mid-tempo sections. Anyway, this was something completely different. Each and every song of their unparalleled second full-length had a distinctive character. The homicidal intro of the title track, the \"Running and hunting and slashing\" bridge of \"Praise of Death\" or the insane drum break of \"Necrophiliac\"- I guess you know what I mean. Yet who is able to distinguish \"Vices\" from \"Cast the First Stone\"? Probably nobody. But apart from the fact that I would be a little bit too late (roughly 25 years), I do not want to bash them for relativising the dogma of high velocity. The band is at liberty to shape its type of thrash the way it wants. It is just regrettable that the formerly divine formation does not show a higher degree of determination. Or to put it in martial terms, the band has lost its will to kill in the most efficient way. Apart from that, it is slightly embarrassing that they adopt a riff fragment from Destruction, just compare the beginning of \"Atrocity Vendor\" with that of \"Death Trap\" from \"Infernal Overkill\". I do not think that they had the intention to \"cover\" the Germans. It is just an ironic twist of fate that they share a riff with a band which was once heavily influenced by, of course, Slayer.\n\nAs expected, the production is flawless. The songs are put in the right light by a clean, powerful and sharp mix. Anything else than this crystal clear sound would have been a nasty surprise, because I doubt that they had to keep an eye on the money during the recordings. Thankfully, there exist more positive things than the title track and the production. Kerry King has written some very strong pieces that are worthy of bearing the bloodcurdling name Slayer. For example, \"You Against You\" marks a late highlight. It follows roughly the path of the title track, but it is a little bit more complex. \"Take Control\" also bows down to the concept of velocity while scoring with the flickering guitars during the verses. \"Implode\" connects a sinister beginning with a high speed continuation and its only minor flaw is caused by Araya's vocals. Whenever he screams the word \"Implode\", his voice sounds somewhat limited. And, by the way, Araya should shave off his ugly beard. He looks like his own grandpa.\n\nI know that I am at risk to be blamed for my oversized nostalgia, but I want Slayer to be fast and furious. Thus, the major defect of the album is constituted by its aforementioned overdose of mid-tempo sections and songs. The running order of the tracks is also counterproductive in this context, because \"Vices\" starts a series of fairly lame songs. Admittedly, the band builds a more or less viable bridge to its approach of \"South of Heaven\" and does not appear as a toothless caricature of itself. Nevertheless, these tunes do not show the real essence of Slayer. The mediocre \"When the Stillness Comes\" marks the low point. It represents a kind of unsuccessful self-quotation, because it draws heavily on their own classics such as \"Mandatory Suicide\" or \"Dead Skin Mask\". Unfortunately, the here presented number is not able to create a comparably intense atmosphere. All that remains is a band that paralyses itself.\n\nApproximately 30 years ago, an unknown pop combo sang a song called \"Video Killed the Radio Star\". In terms of Slayer, we have to notice that \"Mid-tempo Killed the Thrash Metal Star\". Despite some rays of hope, the band has ruined its apparently immovable status during the last 17 years (remember the incredibly trendy \"Diabolus in Musica\") and \"Repentless\" cannot turn back time. But it offers at least four great songs that have the potential to stand the test of time and to join the ranks of their sonic legends. This and the absence of complete flops lead me to the statement that \"Repentless\" is a good record, no more, no less. My only regret is that Jeff Hanneman (R.I.P.) could not participate.\n",
        "\nContrary to an ever-growing party's opinion that Slayer should have thrown in the towel after the death of Jeff Hanneman, there was definitely a path forward for these longtime extreme thrash metal stalwarts even without their most crucial member. Granted, it might not have been one that brought them back to the glory of their formative years, but the fairly strong and appealing character of World Painted Blood didn't itself terminate on the masterful songwriting of Hanneman the way that Reign In Blood and South Of Heaven did. It should be noted up front that the road taken with the nonsensically named Repentless, Slayer's 11th studio LP, did not go the road that ought to have been taken, but it did indeed culminate to a return to form of sorts. That return is to the creative nadir that they were stuck in following the turn of the millennium and the really bad experimental flop that preceded it.\n\nComparisons have already been made by some to this sad, tired affair and the infamous crapshoot God Hates Us All, and while there is some degree of truth to that in terms of quality, stylistically this is not exactly the same. There are several noteworthy attempts at moving towards the rapid paced slaughter-fest of Reign In Blood and also a few more moderated efforts that attempt the atmospheric creepiness of South Of Heaven and Seasons In The Abyss, and overall this is a bit more organized, methodical, and less chaotically executed than the 2001 album that shall not be named, but most of it just falls utterly flat. This album is actually a very good demonstration in what a band sounds like when they've actually run out of fresh ideas, as most of these songs are very indistinct, despite being so bare bones and stripped down that they are almost punishingly easy to follow.\n\nThe over-promotion of this album probably didn't help matter much, but the string of inconsistent single releases that preceded this album were a good indication of the few strengths and many weaknesses at work. One of the high points is the final preceding single \"You Against You\" which manages to kick off on a fairly solid mid-paced groove before launching into faster territory, though the result is something more along the lines of a faster offering on Seasons In The Abyss rather than the truly chaotic fervor of Reign In Blood. Similar stories are to be found in \"Atrocity Vendor\", the best song on here and the last composition offering of Hanneman, and also the reasonably fast but fairly restrained title song \"Repentless\". To be clear, by the standards of this band's past greatness, these songs are more passable than outright brilliant, despite the fact that Gary Holt does provide some pretty sweet guest guitar solos.\n\nThe dregs that rounds out the remaining majority of this album vary in degrees of musical poverty, but they all share an overly contrived and tired demeanor that just doesn't become a band with Slayer's legacy. Whether it's on the faster end of things with the overly simplified speeder \"Implode\" or the plodding and lifeless attempt at revisiting Hanneman's creepy atmospheric ventures on \"When The Stillness Comes\", or the oversupply of moderately fast filler, it's all extremely sub-par, despite being reasonably well produced, and featuring fairly competent lead guitar work and a respectably solid vocal performance out of Tom Araya, who is nevertheless showing his age as he barely manages to keep his voice above a mid-ranged shout. It might be a tad hyperbolic to say, but the hippie caricature of Jesus that Kerry King and company love to depict negatively could probably kick this album's ass.\n",
        "\nOften times when I'm watching my favorite sports team stink it up, I sometimes feel the cognitive dissonance of wishing they'd finally hit rock bottom, letting the game fall out of reach so I can quit having my hopes dashed. I've felt the same way about Slayer in the 21st century.\n\nWhile 2001's one-note, nu-metal tinged God Hates Us All managed to keep things tonally consistent (for better or worse), 2006's average-at-best Christ Illusion felt like a band pulling in two different directions. Yet 2009's World Painted Blood was an inspired return to form, featuring immediate, catchy thrash nuggets. It wasn't a classic, but it was a startling late-career comeback.\n\nThen Lombardo was fired, and Jeff Hanneman tragically died.\n\nHanneman's death was a stunning loss for the metal community, after which many hoped and expected that the band would call it quits, having lost two core members. Slayer, however, decided to soldier on. Much grousing ensued over the prospect over a completely King-penned album,. After six years, Repentless finally arrived...but is it any good?\n\nSort of. To its detriment, Repentless often sounds like a band running on fumes. In addition to it's awful title (what is it? a Satanic LLC?), riff-shapes we've heard countless times before reappear...and reappear again later on the album. Detuned groove riffs have also resurfaced despite being all but completely eschewed on the prior album. While these are not inherently a bad thing in capable hands, Slayer's attempts to groove have generally sounded like strained mimicry of acts much better at that sound. Hearing them resurface here is an unfortunate byproduct of King's near-monopoly on the songwriting.\n\nIt's also a relatively slow album by Slayer's standards, though this isn't the problem. Rather, it's the lazy approach to songwriting that King employs. King is guilty of thrash-by-numbers at numerous points, to where one could easily hum a riff before hearing it.\n\nYet once loses hope, the band tends to find its sweet spot and dig themselves out of a hole. The awkwardly titled \"Delusions of Saviour\" is an instrumental opening that is pleasant enough but largely goes nowhere, but then immediately gives way to \"Repentless\", an energetic, scorching track that will likely become a new staple in live sets; Araya's voice sounds livelier than it has in decades here. Bostaph offers some great drum fills on \"Take Control\", and throughout the album as a whole. \"Cast the First Stone\" bears more of a resemblance to latter-era Testament than Slayer, but packs a severe punch. \"Piano Wire\", the sole song to have a Hanneman co-writing credit, is a quality timewarp to the Slayer of old, with dissonant riffs and a looming sense of despair. \"You Against You\" resembles the raw, unbridled tenacity of Divine Intervention's \"Mind Control\" (in fact, the second half of the album is significantly better than the first).\n\nBut too many of these songs are lifeless and lacking identity for this effort to be deemed an overwhelming success. \"When the Stillness Comes\" has a chilling intro, but squanders that goodwill when the verse begins (at Rockstar Mayhem Fest, this song went over like a dull thud). \"Take Control\" features Araya in half-assed Diabolus vocal form, and he sounds positively bored on the otherwise decent \"Implode\". \"Chasing Death\" resembles a demo track from an up and coming band, hardly worthy of the Slayer brand.\n\nIf this album is guilty of one thing, it's how mundane it is - a band that was once revolutionary and exciting should not be committing such crimes. While there are enjoyable songs throughout the album, particularly the second half, the highs aren't particularly high. When Repentless is good, it's rarely if ever great. At its worst, it's more forgettable than bad. That Slayer is still writing good material 34 years after their inception could be considered a victory of sorts, especially after the loss of two critical members. But it's rather deflating to see the band playing it so safe and by the book, especially when there are moments on this album, such as the aforementioned \"Piano Wire\" that recall the greatness of the past.\n\nRepentless, I suppose, could be considered an occasionally inspired mess, often light on ideas but solid in execution. For an up and coming band, it might be an encouraging start. For Slayer, it's inexcusable. But I suppose for now, it will have to do.\n",
        "\nI really thought that Slayer had got their shit back together after the very good World Painted Blood. They had their maximum anger style pretty much worked out after '09... but clearly Hanneman had a very large part to play in their continued ascent from their slump towards the turn of the century. Not to say he was perfect as a songwriter (Diabolus In Musica, anyone?), but he got his act together sooner than the others, because this is a worrying regression.\n\nI have said this before, but here goes: Slayer have done 3 things very well. They can either up the tempo and write many short songs with almost no let-up in the intensity (Reign In Blood, Undisputed Attitude), slow down and focus more on a sinister and/or doom-like atmosphere (Hell Awaits, South Of Heaven), or mix the two together in varying degrees (1990-1994, and 2006-2009). What they suck at is essentially a 90's version of the latter - slow, pseudo-sinister groove that aims for superficial heaviness rather than letting the atmosphere produced do the talking. And here in lies the main issue: Repentless focuses far too much on the groove nonsense that dominated their worst album, the abominable Diabolus in Musica. Stuff like 'When the Stillness Comes' and 'Cast the First Stone' are bad attempts at recapturing the essence of past atmospheric tracks like 'Divine Intervention' or 'Dead Skin Mask'. This slow, plodding rubbish pretty much dominates the mid-section of the album, leading to the ever annoying 'blur in the middle' that so many albums seem to have.\n\nAnd of course, another issue that arises from this is that the more slow tracks there are, the less fast ones there are, obviously. They are too few and far between, and though these tend not to work as well for reasons I shall get on to, 'Repentless', 'Atrocity Vendor' and the 3/4 paced 'Implode' are a massive step up from the annoying grooves that form this album's bulk. They essentially amount to b-side World Painted Blood songs, and are just below the same level of quality as GHUA era thrashers like 'Disciple' or 'Exile'.\n\nThe reason that even better tracks on this album are below the quality of their former second worst album is because the two members you notice the most, the guitarist and the vocalist, sound goddamn tired. Araya is really starting to sound old now. He pretty much curbed back that horrid strained sound on World Painted Blood, but his performance here is sub-par. The problem is that his aging voice does not convey the sinister atmosphere so much, despite his best efforts to do so. Though he is listenable, he hardly does the slow tracks any favours. His performance on faster tracks sounds worse, for some reason. He is using the same style as before, but it just comes across as less driven and passionate than on their 2009 effort.\n\nHowever, I can't blame Tom entirely for this, because the riffs underneath him sound more tired in execution and composition than him. Though King's early contributions to the band are often ignored (for instance, he wrote the music for 'Evil Has No Boundaries', 'Show No Mercy', 'Black Magic' AND 'Piece By Piece'), his songwriting capabilities have degraded somewhat, as it turns out. As stated, his work on the slow tracks leaves much to be desired, and even the faster ones have issues. They never go anywhere. They start well, but just kind of aimlessly thrash (or groove) about before ending arbitrarily. His riffs are mostly rehashes of previous work, either hearkening back to the boring grooves of 2001 or the mediocre rehashing of their faster 80's songs. They are kind of boring to be honest, which is not something you would expect from any Slayer album.\n\nThe rest of the instrumentation isn't too bad, though. Tom Araya was never a notable bassist (because you can never fucking hear it), though the album doesn't sound thin or light, so clearly he is doing his job. Paul Bostaph has once again filled the shoes of Dave Lombardo, and performs admirably in the face of boring groove. He is constantly trying to jazz up the music with several fills thrown all over the place. It is not wankery by any stretch, but no amount of good drumming can cover up unsuitable vocals and mediocre riffs. Gary Holt steps in to replace Hanneman and King on the leads. This finally brings to an end the self-parody of stupid whammy bar noise that plagues even their best recent songs. In their place are more melodically accomplished, yet aggressive, conventional soloing that is not too far removed from his work with Exodus. However, once again, good riffs, tolerable vocals and decent songwriting make the album, with suitable production helping considerably.\n\nThat is another thing to address - the production. It is a step up from the exceptionally dry and loud Death Magnetic styled production found on their 2009 album, and is one of the few improvements they make. However, they kept the loud part of the equation, and essentially go back to the artificially loud GHUA production job. Loud mixes doesn't make any sort of dull tripe more aggressive, because the music has to be aggressive before the job can accentuate the fury behind the music. There are no dynamics in sound or mood to speak of. Slow moments are just as loud as fast ones, because that is the modern production job.\n\nThis is not Slayer's worst, but it is Slayer's second worst. Even God Hates Us All is a more driven and passionate sounding album than this. Despite its moments, there are no 'Payback's or 'Disciple's here. That album even managed slow songs better, because 'Bloodline' and 'Scarstruck' are some of my favourite modern Slayer songs. Another issue this album has is a massive sinking feeling surrounding it - because as the past has proven, Slayer albums with only one guitarist writing on them always prove to be flops. Unless King stops hogging the songwriting and lets Holt contribute; things can only get worse for Slayer from here. If it does happen, then great! We will see a more traditional Bay Area sound from them, what with Holt's roots in Exodus. If not... then just don't bother with Slayer anymore. As a fan, saying that really hurts. It would seem that Hanneman was Slayer after all.\n\nR.I.P. Jeff Hanneman (31/01/1964 - 02/05/2013).\n",
        "\nAfter months of hype and bullshit marketing, thrash legends Slayer have returned with their newest album release known as \"Repentless.\" I don't know what's funnier: the content of the album itself or the fact that Kerry King had just realized that \"repentless\" isn't actually a word? Well, it should come as no surprise to anyone that Slayer have been recording the same stuff since the beginning for over 30 years. This album is definitive proof that Slayer have literally run out of material to give us as well as the fact that they're past their prime.\n\nNow, what's so special about this album, other than the fact that Exodus' Gary Holt and former Slayer drummer Paul Bostaph are back in the mix? Well, not a whole lot. It's what you'd expect from the band. Fast riffs, the same solos in every song that sound incredibly familiar with the rest of their discography and Araya's blown out vocals, which have been around since the late 90s. The guitars sound a little too fast and light. What I mean by this is if we compare \"Repentless\" to an album such as \"Reign in Blood,\" you'll notice that the latter has speed, intensity and heavy riffing. The vocals and guitars are in sync with the drums and the overall musicality is perfect. Repentless, on the other hand, the instruments sound a little sloppy and light. The lyrics are lazy at times, especially when it comes to the lyricism. They throw the word \"fuck\" around as if they were using it as filler, like they were running out of words to put into the song. Not to mention that the lyrics, other than what I've mentioned, are very tongue in cheek, they lack meaning, originality and creativity. As mentioned before, Tom Araya's vocals are blown out, age has definitely caught up with him. I admire the fact that he's still able to belt them out but like Metallica's James Hetfield, they're dry. My main complaint about this installment is the fact that it's same stuff, again. Like, I can't barely tell the difference between this album and their previous work \"World Painted Blood.\" I can't tell if they're genuinely trying to write new material or if they're just giving us the finger, saying \"fuck you, give us your money.\" I love Slayer, have been to their shows and have been a fan for years but I can't help but feel disappointed. Surely, after all the hype the band has brought to this album along with their wine brand, clothing line, shot glass endorsement and all else, that we would expect to get something good here. Sadly, I was wrong. \n\nNeedless to say, Slayer isn't what they once were. Half of the original members are gone, their last good album, in my mind, was South of Heaven. They may be past their prime but I have to admire them for the fact that they're still going at it and bringing a sound that all fans recognize, even though it's really repetitive. Despite their recent loss of Jeff Hanneman, this band is filled with very talented and legendary musicians. It's just sad to see their talent wasted on an album such as this. On the bright side, at least they're not like Metallica, right?\n",
        "\nOkay, this is going to be a tough one to write. Like many others, I grew up with this band and have been following them since 1991. I\u2019ve seen them live over ten times. I really wanted this to be good, but.. it\u2019s just not.\n\nFor some reason, everything after Divine Intervention has just rubbed me the wrong way. I could never really get into it, except for a few tracks here and there, like \u201cPoint\u201d and \u201cScreaming From the Sky\u201d and maybe \u201cWar Zone\u201d, for it\u2019s straight up aggression. But really that\u2019s about it. God Hates Us All was terrible (thankfully there are none of those horrendous nu metal riffs here), Christ Illusion and World Painted Blood were just forgettable. And especially after losing Jeff, I was really curious to see what they would, or could, bring to the table.\n\nAh, Jeff. The guy lurking in the shadows, never taking the spotlight, but writing the best and most classic tunes for the band. He didn\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone. Jeff was the deal. He didn\u2019t feel the need for flash, or hell, even interviews. He just did what he did. He did it better than most. Sadly he\u2019s not with us anymore, but if there was ever a member of Slayer I would have really liked to sit down and talk with, it would have been Jeff, hands down. He just seemed like a very interesting person, and a lot deeper than what he would allow the media to see. He liked his privacy and I absolutely respect that.\n\nI\u2019m not going to make comparisons to classic albums because we all know deep down that Slayer will never be able to deliver on that level again. But come on.. the output on this album, for more than half of it, is just weak. Bland riffs, bland arrangements, and terribly stupid lyrics. Remember when Slayer lyrics used to be fucked up and good? Well they haven\u2019t been like that for 20 years now. The lyrics here are embarrassing. \n\nThe production and sound on the album is decent. It\u2019s nothing special, even with Terry Date behind the desk. Everything sounds okay, but just bland and uninspired. The only real problem I have is with the kick drums. How the hell did that even get approved? Really, that\u2019s the kick drum sound? Speaking of drums, Paul Bostaph\u2019s performance here is very, very boring. He\u2019s just doing the bare minimum and nothing else, I never would have expected him to play it so safe. Let me also point out that I have no problems with Paul and in fact, I think his style suits Slayer more, as he\u2019s more of a mechanical, cold type of drummer which fits in with their music better in my opinion. But here, he\u2019s not even that. There\u2019s no creativity in his drumming whatsoever. \n\nGary Holt is on the album, and I love Gary. I\u2019m really glad he didn\u2019t contribute anything to this, because pretty much nothing is note worthy. He played a few leads and that\u2019s it. Tom sounds bored and out of place at times, and Kerry..\n\nKerry is really getting on my fucking nerves. There\u2019s no other way to say it. He\u2019s treated Dave like shit over the years, talked shit about Paul when he first left the band, and was even a bit of a dick when talking about Jeff after his passing. And he will milk Slayer fans for every cent that he can because to him Slayer is just a business now \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want to let it go. He would never have the courage to just stop Slayer and start another band. Why? No one would give a fuck. And he\u2019s not capable of writing anything else other than half assed Slayer riffs, a mere shadow of his former self. Kerry is great live, but that\u2019s about it. \n\nI really wanted this to be good, but besides \u201cYou Against You\u201d, the album goes in one ear and out the other. That\u2019s the only track which is a bit different from the others and it works. The riffs are good, the arrangement is good, hell, even the leads are good. Thanks Gary.\n\nWhile the album is not terrible and doesn\u2019t feature anything as hideous as \u201cThreshold\u201d (seriously, go back and listen to that song again) it\u2019s still not good enough. Slayer need to REALLY step up their game, they need to take risks, they need to be madly aggressive and angry next time around so people will go \u201choly fucking shit \u2013 that\u2019s amazing\u201d, and if they\u2019re not willing to do that, then they should just stop. \n\nOnly for the die hard's, I suppose. I thought I was one of them, but I guess I\u2019m not. I\u2019d rather listen to something else.\n\nR.I.P. Jeff Hanneman, 1964-2013.\n",
        "\nDoes Slayer really need an introduction? All right then\u2026 It\u2019s been six years since we had a piece of material from these old fellas which is quite a gap, and a lot of shit happened since 2009. New label, new members, new production team and the loss of Jeff.\n\n\u201cRepentless\u201d starts off pretty strong with the title-track being introduced by the instrumental Delusions of Saviour. While the intro-track, just like 95% of other intro-tracks, could've been used for a mid-section, it feels a bit redundant. However, I do enjoy the track it breaks into which is the title-track, Repentless. Bostaph thrusts a lot of life into the track with his all around solid and tight performance. But after that, there\u2019s a wide gap until something worthwhile comes along. When the Stillness Comes was very quickly compared to South of Heaven, and therefore labelled as a major throwback. However, this track does not make it into the highlights spot. It never really takes off properly and seems unfinished. But I will give them credit for bringing some variation into the album. Slayer already did a track reminiscent of South of Heaven in 1994 with 213, which I think is a better track. We\u2019re also treated with some recycling in the likes of Atrocity Vendor. It was originally recorded during the \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d-sessions and released on a single the year after. There\u2019s not much change from the original version. Still corny and forgettable. Implode is probably one of the worst tracks off the album and it was definitely not a wise decision for this to be the first track to be heard from the album back when it was announced. Forgettable. That\u2019s the word I have to use again and again. It\u2019s not until the second last track, You Against You that we get something that\u2019s worth coming back for. Just as the title-track it mixes some good riffing with skank-beats and just good songwriting. Of course, this does not rank among the band\u2019s best offerings, but it\u2019s solid, and a relief on this record. It\u2019s really hard not to shout along when Tom yells out \u201cYOU AGAINST YOU!\u201d\n\nBehind the knobs is Terry Date, who has produced a lot of albums which I love, not only because the songwriting but also the production. He does a good job on this album. I am pretty sure he had some restrictions, because the albums sounds like you would expect. Just like a Slayer record in 2015. However, credit is due for the heaviness on the record. The instruments have a good depth and punch to them. I do however think both \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d and \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d had more character in its productions, especially when it comes to the guitars. But it wouldn\u2019t had made any sense to go down the same road once more.\n\nTo the touchy subject, the line-up. This is the first album without Jeff and once again Dave is out of the band. A lot of fans have said that it\u2019s not Slayer without Lombardo and continue to do so. And as an almost lifelong Slayer fan I would like to say that it is total fucking bullshit. Bostaph is a really good drummer and if anyone shines on \u201cRepentless\u201d, it\u2019s definitely him. People seem to forget the past he has with Forbidden, featuring on two of the best thrash albums to come out of the bay area. Whether Dave or Paul plays on this record doesn\u2019t change the fact of who\u2019s at the helm of this ship. Would the album have been better if Jeff was alive? Maybe and maybe not. \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d and \u201cDiabolus in Musica\u201d are still pretty bad, and don\u2019t take that the wrong way, I still grief Jeff\u2019s death. Would it have been better if Gary Holt contributed? Maybe and maybe not. \u201cBlood in Blood Out\u201d was definitely not the return everybody had hoped for. But I hope to see him contribute in the future, because Slayer won\u2019t stop until both King and Araya are in the nursing home. So throw out your goddamn \u201ceverything but the original line-up is not Slayer\u201d-goggles. I witnessed this line-up perform at Wacken 2014, which is on the deluxe edition, and it is a fucking power demonstration. As Gary Holt said, he is not some new kid, or a groove metal-dude. He\u2019s a veteran. And so is Bostaph.\n\nI only find two tracks worthy of coming back to on this record. The title-track, Repentless and You Against You. Would I mind hearing these tracks live? No\u2026 Would I mind hearing something from \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d or \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d live? No\u2026 But I sure as hell would prefer a set-list only with excerpts from the first six studio releases and hear the classics. At least it has a pretty face. The cover for this album is without a doubt the best since \u201cReign in Blood\u201d.\n\nIf I were to place it on the list, I would place it under the previous two albums, but it\u2019s definitely a better record than both \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d and \u201cDiabolus in Musica\u201d. But, what you see is what you get. More of the same. For some, that is fine and is going to cut it perfectly, and I\u2019d wish I was on the same wagon. But I\u2019m not.\n\nR.I.P. Jeff Hanneman, 1964-2013.\n\nWritten for Reigning Damnation.\n",
        "\nIt was with heavy heart that I learned that Slayer, the de facto thrash gods and my favorite band of all time eeeever, would attempt to persevere after the untimely death of Jeff Hanneman. Usually, when the guy who pioneered your sound and wrote all of your best riffs departs for another plane of existence, that\u2019s a pretty fucking sure sign that it\u2019s time to throw in the towel. But instead of retiring with dignity on the heels of two very good resurrection pieces (I like \u2018em, anyway), Kerry King and Tom Araya soldiered on, recruiting Exodus main-man Gary Holt for extra guitar duties and swapping formidable original drummer Dave Lombardo back out for jack-of-all-bands Paul Bostaph. A new Slayer album used to be a cause for celebration; now, it\u2019s the most disappointing new release I\u2019ve yet experienced and a final stain on the band\u2019s great legacy.\n\nThe previous Slayer album that Repentless most immediately resembles is God Hates Us All, with a cleaner production than that album\u2019s shitty \u201cwall-of-noise\u201d approach that obscured a lot of riffs but without any of the catchy \u201cso-bad-they\u2019re-kinda-good\u201d numbers like \u201cPayback\u201d or \u201cScarstruck\u201d. Otherwise the two are very comparable: the emphasis on low range chugging, slow grooves (like 2/3 of the album), simplified arrangements, cut-and-paste angry numbskull lyrics, and forgettable, interchangeable riffs are calling cards of both records. Remember the classic \u201cSlayer riff\u201d and its variations? Those weird diminished melodies you\u2019d find in tracks like \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d, \u201cBeauty Through Order\u201d, \u201cJihad\u201d, \u201cAt Dawn They Sleep\u201d or whatever? Well apparently Hanneman wrote all of those, because there are virtually no distinctive picked riffs here. Instead, there is an absurd reliance on simple chugging and chord changes, with the occasional recycled Phrygian melodies you\u2019ve heard a million times on Iced Earth albums. \n\nHell, the album even opens with one! \u201cDelusions of Saviour\u201d is among the more pointless intro tracks I\u2019ve ever come across, a brief back and forth between two generic slow riffs with some King wah nonsense before the album proper. The bulk of the album expands little on this concept and tracks like \u201cPiano Wire\u201d, \u201cCast the First Stone\u201d \u201cPride in Prejudice\u201d, and \u201cVices\u201d all bleed together with nary a memorable riff between them; you may lump them in with \u201cOvert Enemy\u201d, \u201cAmericon\u201d, \u201cHuman Disease\u201d, or any of the other indistinctive chuggers from the band\u2019s not-too-distant past. Araya does put in a surprisingly good vocal performance given the quality of the material he\u2019s forced to work with and the occasional awkward diction. And you\u2019ve also got to admire Holt\u2019s attempts to provide a bit of lead magic in Jeff\u2019s absence (and apparently Kerry\u2019s too), but most of these songs are unsalvageable even as a metal primer.\n\nRepentless also mostly eschews the experimental numbers that have dotted Slayer albums for the last two decades (\u201cSerenity in Murder\u201d, \u201cPlaying with Dolls\u201d, \u201cAddict\u201d). The closest they come to anything even remotely different than the album\u2019s repentlessly bland formula is \u201cWhen the Stillness Comes,\u201d which merely features a \u201cspooky\u201d arpeggiated clean riff intro and a more spoken-word style delivery from Araya. Traditionally, these sorts of songs/parts of songs were useful as melodic relief between the thrash nightmares. Here it\u2019s just a slight variation on the plodding flavor that\u2019s near omnipresent throughout the album. And the clean riff wouldn\u2019t even be that memorable if it wasn\u2019t the only one on the album. I suppose all the unforgettable, haunting clean bits from \u201c213\u201d, \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d, \u201cAddict\u201d, and \u201cSpill the Blood\u201d were Jeff\u2019s ideas too.\n\nOn the rare occasions when the songs do pick up the tempo, things don\u2019t fare too much better. Paul Bostaph\u2019s skills have atrophied quite considerably since his early 90\u2019s peak on albums like Twisted Into Form and Divine Intervention. His performance is very straightforward and by-the-numbers, without any of Lombardo\u2019s devil-may-care playfulness, and every supposedly fast bit on the album always feels a few bpm\u2019s shy of what it should be. In disbelief, I went back to some of the stuff from their last two albums, and tracks like \u201cFlesh Storm\u201d and \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d still sound pretty reckless and energetic to these ears. Supposed thrashers like \u201cRepentless\u201d and \u201cImplode\u201d sound like they\u2019re being restrained by comparison and even though they\u2019re faster than the others, they\u2019re still mostly analogous to the generic arrangements of their slower brethren: simple tremolo riff here, held chords there, recycle and repeat with maybe a solo or mid-paced bit to mix it up. Guess clever riff-cycles, evil harmonies, and devastating speed riffs were Jeff\u2019s trademark.\n\nAs a final insult added to injury, I was initially somewhat excited to see \u201cAtrocity Vendor\u201d on the track list. This was Hanneman\u2019s last composition for the band, previously only available as a B-side, and while it wasn\u2019t the greatest, it was still a lot of fun. Disappointingly, it has been rerecorded from the original version, robbing it of much of its intensity and Jeff\u2019s final solo work. The fact that it\u2019s still a highlight is a symptom of the sad reality of Repentless\u2019 quality. \n\nOn the plus side, the packaging is quite well done. The deluxe digipak folds out into a huge upside down cross with a lot of dark medieval-style artwork that\u2019s interesting to ponder. I\u2019d like to find a way to mount it up on my basement wall somehow; at the very least, this would physically separate it from my CD collection and help discourage future listens.\n\nI expected this to be bad, but even I wasn\u2019t prepared for what is truly perhaps their worst album. And this is coming from a raging fanboy that unironically believes that almost everything they\u2019ve done is impossibly fucking awesome (including the recent Christ Illusion and World Painted Blood) and can even find a few things to like about the deservedly-maligned Diabolus and GHUA albums. Without Hanneman, Slayer is a walking corpse in desperate need of a final resting place. \n\nIf it seems like I can\u2019t shut the fuck up about a guy that doesn\u2019t even play on the album, understand that his absence is palpable. Dude was my hero, and there\u2019s nothing heroic about this inexcusable travesty. \n\n\nHighlights: \u201cRelentless\u201d, \u201cTake Control\u201d, \u201cAtrocity Vendor\u201d\n",
        "\n2009 saw the release of World Painted Blood, Jeff Hanneman's last album with the iconic Slayer. The album was a bit of a letdown, by Slayer's standards. Now, six years later, the time has come for a follow up. Slayer have themselves called Repentless \"the most anticipated album of the year\", though that's a bit of a stretch. Especially considering the gigantic shadow cast by Iron Maiden's The Book Of Souls, released only a week prior. Still, I've hyped myself up a good bit in anticipation for Slayer's latest effort.\n\nIt is, of course, Slayer's first full length since co-founder Hanneman's tragic passing some two years ago, and Kerry King has had to fill in to lay down what would have been Hanneman's guitars, with the exception of some solos thanks to Gary Holt of Exodus, who has of course played the late Hanneman's guitar parts live for some years.\n\nThe album consists of twelve fairly short songs, where the longest songs both clock in at four minutes and 21 seconds, meaning what we have is basically a bunch of no bullshit, straight to the point, thrash metal tracks. 'When The Stillness Comes' has that dark, brooding intro before breaking into a mid tempo thrasher, reminiscent in style of 'Seasons In The Abyss', one of my all time favorite Slayer tracks. It is one of the album's highlights, thanks to the dark atmosphere and some incredible dueling guitars.\n\nOther tracks, like 'Implode' (improved from the track which was revealed last year) and 'You Against You', move things to another familiar area. Namely neck thrashing headbangers in the style of classic Slayer. In tracks like these, the guitars are just sublime. King really shows off, showing he's still got it. However, 'Vices' and 'Take Control' are songs that don't do much for me. They mostly feel stale and repetitive. Most of the material though, is solid, if not magnificent.\n\nThe solos that Gary Holt do put in are solid, and he's shown in live performances that he is a worthy replacement of the iconic Hanneman. The other notable change is of course the departure of drummer Dave Lombardo. He's been replaced by the familiar Paul Bostaph, who played on several Slayer albums during the 90's and early 00's. Including two of my favorites, Diabolus In Musica and God Hates Us All. So, there's no doubt that he'd be a solid drummer on Repentless, which of course, he is. There's nothing incredibly magnificent to mention, but he gets the job done and the drums have a very good sound, production wise, as does that of the guitars and Tom Araya's bass and vocals. Crisp and clean, really letting the musical prowess show.\n\nAraya doesn't sound as angry as he has in the past, though. At least, that's how I experience it. Some tracks could have needed a bit more anger in his explosive shrieks. For example, 'You Against You' is angry as hell during the instrumental parts, but lacking in the vocal department. I do however like Araya without a word of complaint in 'Chasing Death' and the aforementioned 'When The Stillness Comes'. Not that it can ever be mistaken that Araya sounds as potent and venomous as ever.\n\nHanneman penned 'Piano Wire' is another of the highlights, showing some tough as all hell, mid tempo chugging riffs alongside Araya's almost punk like thrash mastery on the vocals, that just seems to put more flames to the fire. All in all, Repentless is clearly a step up from its predecessor. It's a complete album in the sense that there seems to be little filler, and everything just fits. The band sounds and feels very tight and tough. Even though no single song actually sticks out with its awesomeness, as a whole, it's a pretty solid fucking thrash album. Let's just hope we don't have to wait another six years for the next one.\n\nStandout tracks: Repentless, When The Stillness Comes, Piano Wire\n\nOriginally written for 'getmetal.com'\n",
        "\n...for nu 'metal' is alive, and you can't kill it.\n\nPardon the reference to an old Slayer song, for this album does not deserve to be graced with such a thing. This is their big sell-out, and unlike Sound of White Noise, Metallica or Countdown to Extinction, Slayer fail completely at it. And the odd thing is, they don't bend over backwards for commercialism quite as much as the aforementioned commercial blockbusters of the 90's. Unlike the aforementioned albums, which compared to their predecessors are virtually unrecognisable as efforts by their respective bands, this is undeniably Slayer. And that makes this feel so much worse - this isn't a makeover for the '90s, this is a watering down of their trademark sound.\n\nThe sound on display here is actually very confused. They take the groovier parts of Divine Intervention and Seasons in the Abyss, and then some modern hardcore and crap nu 'metal' influences in an attempt to be one with that scene. The end result is an album with very downtuned guitars (the lowest the guitars go for a Slayer album, I believe) playing bastardised 2-3 note grooves or generic '-core' chugging. At the same time though, that is all mixed with some pretty average thrashing with songs like 'Scrum' or 'Bitter Peace' and what amounts to a restrained version of typical Hanneman and King lead work. This is so utterly weird to listen to and look at, seeing the Slayer logo written in an odd 90's fashion on the album cover and then listening to rapped nonsense like 'Death's Head' right after some thrashing mayhem from the opener.\n\nSlayer weren't trying on this album, because the two albums that surround this one are far more consistent and solid than this. Hanneman and King put almost no effort into their riffing, instead opting for the superficial heaviness found through repeated, slow, downtuned grooves. This of course, squanders any attempt at actual, oppressive heaviness or actual aggression, and instead gives utterly boring, repetitive songs that mostly go nowhere. Araya just doesn't give a damn here, though his voice continues down the 'maximum shout' road, it lacks the conviction of previous performances. He attempts to get around the lack of dynamics and atmosphere his voice had on Divine Intervention by adding in some whispering ('Death's Head', 'Stain of Mind') to no effect, it just sounds utterly revolting. Even on their previous 2 albums, the style he used worked well on faster tracks and even some slower tracks. However, here his voice conveys nothing whatsoever; it is just boring and monotone. Paul Bostaph tries his hardest to make the music better through his now trademark precise, fill and double bass happy style, but no amount of admittedly good drumming can cover up the myriad of flaws here. He is the only member to improve on previous performances, and the only one that appears to care about what he is doing.\n\nThe songwriting isn't good, but it isn't absolutely horrible. They have the decency to keep things short for the most part, because these songs have very little worth to them, as exemplified by the bonus track 'Wicked'. It just can't keep the listener gripped for its 6 minute run time, and barely manages to keep interest after 2 minutes. Another issue can be found in the opening track. 'Bitter Peace' has a needless 90 second drudging intro; it would have made more sense to just start it at the moment the song actually starts. This happens a few times during the album, the song will change up from a very boring section to a less boring faster section, but with a bit of silence separating them. It feels like they are trying to make the songs and albums longer through filler, because these sections really drag the album down.\n\nThe songs generally fall into 3 categories, the worst of which is terrible nu 'metal'. Tracks like 'Love to Hate' or 'Death's Head' are irritating rapped nonsense, while 'Desire' and 'Stain of Mind' both load up the quiet sections with whispered vocals, which amounts to an attempt at atmosphere through a nu 'metal' filter. Needless to say it fails, and these songs are utterly revolting and terrible. Meanwhile, tracks like 'Screaming from the Sky' and 'In the Name of God' are Pantera/Sepultura worship at best, being as boring and stagnant as those bands' respective '92/'93 groove blockbusters. From this heap, a mere 3 tracks can be salvaged. For the most part, 'Bitter Peace', 'Scrum' and 'Point' amount to double bass driven, watered down versions of the modern thrash sound established on Divine Intervention. Though these would be outtakes at best on that album, and wouldn't even be that on earlier works, here they sound like the greatest thing ever, especially in comparison to the uninspired groove and sickening nu 'metal'.\n\nSave for the really Korn-esque moments, this is a mostly boring and worthless album. This is so boring in fact, that I fell asleep trying to listen to it... at one in the afternoon. Every song has this 'grey' tone to it, especially with the unending downtuning and Araya's boring to disgusting voice being the main cause. No amount of decent solos or drumming can fix this, for most metal albums live or die by a vocalist with conviction and a set of decent riffs. However, ALL albums live or die by how many ideas they have musically, relative to the length of each track and the number of tracks. In addition, good songwriting with smooth transitions from one section to another is essential. This fails all of these, except for the 3 decent thrash metal songs found within. Don't bother with this, even the fairly mediocre God Hates Us All is at least one league better\n",
        "\n...Slayer are hungry for your blood. As the title may suggest, this release was put out during thrash's dark days, waiting for an unsuspecting fan of groove or alternative metal to listen to it. That alone makes this release admirable, though it can't excuse some glaring flaws with this album. Essentially, this release can best be summed up as 'Slayer being Slayer', a trend which has continued from Christ Illusion.\n\nDon't worry, for the good far outweighs the bad, but coming off from the likes of South of Heaven and Season in the Abyss, it comes across as a tad weak. The sound on display is quite an odd one - a mix of usual Slayer thrash, hardcore in the shorter tracks, and some more modern groove metal that was typical of the era. I can't really call this a sellout though, because the groove had been present in Slayer's sound since 1988 ('Behind the Crooked Cross'), and isn't any more potent than what was heard on the preceding album.\n\nOne of the album's main flaws is the production. Though the guitars are a considerable step up from the 'fluffy' sound on Seasons in the Abyss, the overall sound of the album is flat. The guitars are thin and sterile, and the drums, especially the bass drums, click as though they are made of plastic. It isn't quite ...And Justice for All levels of sterility, but it does come quite close at times. The mix is completely off, too. The drums and vocals are too loud, there is no bass or low end to speak of, and the guitars take a back seat as a result.\n\nThe performances from the band aren't quite at the same level as before, but they aren't phoning in their efforts either. King and Hannemann mix up the more modern grooves with their usual set of simple and aggressive thrash riffs, and there are several examples of this on faster and mid tempo tracks, like 'Killing Fields', 'Circle of Beliefs' and 'Dittohead'. Newly recruited drummer Paul Bostaph doesn't show much promise for the future here, as he delivers one of his least consistent performances here. His fills and change-ups are executed well, but he constantly falls off time when it comes to extended double bass passages, which is very noticeable due to the loud drums. When it comes to the vocals, Araya gives his first 'maximum shout' performance, which just sound very loud and angry. They lack the dynamics or atmospheric qualities of his previous performances, but still come out better than what Phil Anselmo or Robb Flynn were shouting about at the time.\n\nThough some perceive this to be an attempt at a commercial Reign in Blood, this isn't quite the case. There are some shorter, crossover styled thrashers that bring back memories of that album, but the general sound is a similar mid tempo one to that seen on the previous 2 albums. There is a greater focus on atmosphere through the vocals on slower tracks, with the title track succeeding thanks to a particularly tortured sounding set of shouts used by Araya. On the contrary, both '213' and 'Serenity in Murder' fail due to the ludicrous 'I need a friend!' nonsense of the former, or the tired, flat vocal performance of the latter. While both of these feature some of the best riffs and drumwork of the album, the vocals kill it somewhat. These are his worst moments here, and really Tom's vocals are better for the faster tracks, which convey the aggression of the songs perfectly.\n\nAt this point, it sounds as though I am ragging on this album a lot, and that it is bad. But it isn't, at all. Despite its flaws, it works. The slow tracks are some of the gloomier things Slayer have written, managing some considerable level of atmosphere even when the vocals and production let it down. The slow double bass forever simmers, like a form of restrained rage that kicks off into high speed destruction at points. Faster sections and tracks on here are merciless, this is a far more pugilistic and violent album compared to the preceding two slower albums. Though it isn't quite as good at atmosphere, the rage at higher tempos is only matched by the aforementioned Reign in Blood and the punk covers album that would follow. This album is also a riff happy one, expect many change-ups in even the shorter songs. This is a solid thrash release alright, it just has several fundamental flaws that the album can sometimes overcome. I can't recommend this to all fans of Slayer, only those that like what they did from 1988 to 1996 inclusive, and their modern, post 2006 material. A second rate Slayer album, but a good one.\n",
        "\n...as this EP ignites your timid blood. The infamous Haunting the Chapel, probably the greatest EP ever to grace the world of metal. What is on here are THE heaviest songs of their time, and still leave nasty bruises to this day. Though short on content, you will remember your first listen for many, many years to come.\n\nWhat is on show here is essentially a far more brutal, intense and crushing version of the thrash metal sound. The first wave of thrash debuts from this band, Metallica, Anthrax and to a lesser extent, Dark Angel, all exhibited high-flying NWOBHM vocals, a sense of melody borrowed from the British and a general lack of brutality, relatively speaking. This features a much grimier sound, and its framework can be found in the likes of the unholy trinity of 1986, Possessed's Seven Churches, and a lot of the more orthodox thrash oriented death metal that would come. Araya's vocal delivery no longer features high screams, he has taken on a considerably grittier tone with some blood-curdling, menacing mid-range work. The riff-craft is nothing short of incredible, there are many, many examples of King and Hanneman (R.I.P.) being some of the '80s finest around in every nook and cranny. The solos are somewhere between the spastic lunacy that has become a trademark of the band, and the old-fashioned (but superior) NWOBHM inspired work with a great knack for simplicity, extended length without noodling or over-repetition, and melody. The man behind the kit is none other than drummer god Dave Lombardo, who even early in his career, shows the balance between keeping time, being technical and adding to the ferocity of the music. Fills left and right, double bass for miles, all while showing restraint when necessary. Though his true skill would become clear on the next 3 albums, it is already close to the frenzied insanity of the future here.\n\nThe production only points more to the brutal thrash/early death metal sound. The guitar tone is very murky and heavy, bordering on doom metal at slower tempos - that opening riff to 'Chemical Warfare' exemplifies the effect. It is a similar tone to the ones found on Seven Churches or Sepultura's Schizophrenia, an overall very crushing sound, that smashes you in the face with a hammer (hah hah... no). The guitars are also quite loud, sharing their presence with the slightly reverb tinged vocals, with the bass not far behind. However, this leaves the great drum performance behind a wall of vicious guitar work, and though far from inaudible, very occasionally they are too quiet to have the impact you would expect. The overall production quality is quite distorted, to be honest. This adds to the griminess and early 80's underground feel of the album, giving way to a more lethal atmosphere reminiscent of this band's seminal 1985 album, Hell Awaits.\n\nThe songwriting chops of the band had matured somewhat with this release, to the point where there is variation on a three track EP with material from one set of sessions. Opener 'Chemical Warfare' is the prototype to the longer songs seen on the band's aforementioned 1985 sophomore effort. Unlike previous songs by Slayer, it manages to progress a bit more, something only really seen on 'Metalstorm: Face the Slayer' and 'Black Magic' with their extended introductions. This song has a bit more than an extended intro, instead managing to combine 4 distinct passages and a set of extended solos in its 6 minute run time. They aren't even on their second album, and can already do long songs better than Metallica - that is an achievement on its own. The other two tracks on here are essentially far heavier and dirtier versions of what was seen on Show No Mercy. Both aren't particularly unconventional in structure (though 'Captor of Sin' begins with a solo, which is a bit odd), both are under 4 minutes in length, and generally don't focus on atmosphere quite as much as the opener. They are inclined to rock out and have a good, satanic time (and in the case of Captor of Sin, a very good time with Satan... check the lyrics). They are bit of a let down, but almost any Slayer song is a let down compared to the almighty 'Chemical Warfare', so don't be put off.\n\nSo that is what this EP is. A fine example of a nearly death metal sound, one of the first truly brutal thrash releases that detached itself from the NWOBHM, and some good old satanic fun. This comes as essential to fans of more brutal thrash metal, as well as death and to a lesser extent, black metal. Even if you don't like those, it is your duty as a metal head to at least own this bit of metal history, lest HE TAKE YOU DOWN INTO THE FIRE!\n",
        "\nBack in May or June 1984, I accidentally discovered the Metal Hammer magazine. It goes without saying that I bought it immediately. After ordering the previous issues quickly, I studied all articles very carefully. I got the feeling that I opened gigantic gates to a new world. In particular, I must admit that I was deeply impressed by a bloody-minded black and white image of a band that leaned over an abused female victim. Shame on me. But to my relief, I have to say that I was not fascinated by the image itself. It just made me extremely curious and I hoped that the strange guys on the picture were able to extend the spectrum of my record collection. \n\nAll my hopes were fulfilled as soon as the needle got in contact with the vinyl and \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" broke loose. To my own surprise, I did not listen to pure noise. The shrill cry of Araya and the brief guitar solo before the first verse attacked my nerves in a previously unknown manner. But it was a fantastic experience at the same time. Slayer was raging like rabid dogs but they did not neglect the necessary amount of melodies (I dare to use this word while begging for forgiveness at the same time). Additionally, the opener as well as the following tunes were clearly structured and easily accessible. To equip the songs with a comprehensible formula was not the only good idea of the composers Hanneman (R.I.P.) and King. They were also able to deliver an appropriate level of diversification. For example \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" was based on sheer franticness, but the subsequent \"The Antichrist\" thrived on its overwhelming main riff.\n\nThe first four songs of the here presented prototype were (and still are) a thrash metal monument for eternity. Just dive into the dark and homicidal middle part of \"Die by the Sword\" or the gripping chorus of \"Fight till Death\". And do not forget to listen very closely to the highly interesting main riff of the latter. And, of course, you must pay special attention to its kamikaze-like solo parts after the second chorus. A sonic brainwash par excellence. And I beg you to... I guess it is better to stop here. I am definitely at risk to lose the last bit of objectivity.\n\nDespite the slightly hysterical aura of the album, the band kept control at all times. This was not least because of Araya\u00b4s superior vocals that did not tolerate any kind of contradiction. He sounded like a warlord that commanded his troops to battle. This comparison is not randomly chosen. Slayer proved its capability to generate a deep black atmosphere (for instance during the long instrumental part at the beginning of the fifth track) so that \"Show No Mercy\" can be seen as the belligerent mother of all black thrash albums. And of course, a song like \"Black Magic\" also indicated the more or less strongly distinct interest of the group in relation to occult themes.\n\n\"Show No Mercy\" followed a strict guideline without losing its tension. Of course, its explosiveness was constituted on the basis of the very homogeneous song material. Nevertheless, each and every song had its own character. We were talking about the differences between the first two songs and, to give you a further example, the last two tracks showed the same image. The subliminally vicious \"Crionics\" scored with its evil aura and the howling guitars during the solo sections, while the title track ran stubbornly straight without looking left or right. What the songs had in common was the dense and impure appearance. In objective terms, Slayer\u00b4s debut failed to deliver an optimal production. But it possessed exactly the sound that the first work of these musical revolutionists needed. After more than 31 years, I am unable to consider the sound and the songs separately. I worship this album with all its strengths and its very few weaknesses and I do not want to be confronted with a new version of this masterpiece. Just think of the horrible second recording of \"Bonded by Blood\". To sum up, \"Show No Mercy\" was (part of) the Big Bang of extreme metal. I bet that every thrasher still reminds the moment when he heard this album for the first time. A daring thesis? However, this work deserves our lifelong respect.\n",
        "\nAs a general rule, I don't like Slayer all that much. For me, their music does sound like it is dominated by a few main elements, which are usually strong and exciting, yet don't reward a long listening time. In other words, I rarely listen to Slayer by deliberate choice and there are many thrash bands that I would choose to experience ahead of them. There's something dry or predictable about them, and for a band who want to sound crazed and out of control, that can be a problem. That said, I sometimes find it a little difficult to agree with people about which Slayer album I like best.\n\n'Seasons in the Abyss' has one distinct advantage and one obvious disadvantage over most of Slayer's other work. The advantage is that it is generally more varied and boasts a less repetitive attack than 'Reign in Blood' and its like, though the disadvantage is that it can't hope to live up to the intensity and fury of that kind of album. For me, the mid-paced songs here work very well and actually remain more memorable to me than the quick ones, which just sound generally like Slayer and not much else, even if some of them are pretty exciting. The reason why they blur is because I'm not a sucker for pure speed, I actually prefer a sure momentum with some element of hook or groove or movement: I can actually see Kerry King stand still as he blasts out some of those razor-sharp riffs, just like he does when he plays live, and I would prefer riffs that make me run around and lose my head. That's why 'Diabolus in Musica' wasn't a terrible album for me and also why this album has its charms over something more straight-ahead, in the stylistic sense at least. Here, the band straddle the divide between fast and medium pace about 50/50 and it gives me a lot more chance to work my way into the album and appreciate the musicianship, rather than just being brushed off by unwelcoming music.\n\nI have a little problem with the tone on this album, though the production and mix are pretty good. The guitar tone is too rounded and not trebly enough for the kind of vicious music that Slayer plays, so that the faster songs actually end up blurring and not sounding as cut-throat as they should, while the groovier numbers don't suffer so much. The opening of 'Skeletons of Society', for example, simply sounds flat and lifeless because its riff remains at a very low intensity, where it should be livelier and sharper. The number of riffs is not a problem, coming thick and fast in most songs and adding enough variety and detail to songs, including the shorter numbers. I prefer the leads here to some of the purely extreme effects from the past, since I need that melodic presence to hollow out a song and create a space for serotonin to flourish, not only adrenaline. Those bursts of noise from Kerry King crop up, but aren't overused in the same way as on 'Reign in Blood', and the leads seem generally to have been thought about for longer and had care spent on them. Unfortunately, something keeps the drums from sounding sharp as well, so that Dave Lombardo can't accelerate or drive the songs up a notch with any real force, only maintain the position that the rest of the band have come to. I have a problem with Tom Araya's vocals in general, and this album hardly represents a high point for them: in the fast songs, he tends to let out a stream of words with one kind of phrasing and little change in intonation, so that the monotony of some of the quicker songs is hard to bear, since the vocals have a much more concentrated sound than the guitar.\n\nFor all my criticisms, there are certainly some good songs on this record, and Slayer were never slouches in terms of pure musicianship or creating excitement. Almost all of the pure thrash songs rule, although I do wonder a little about 'Blood Red' - perhaps it wasn't necessary to be included. Some people have stated problems with 'Dead Skin Mask' and 'Expendable Youth', but the slightly repetitive and downbeat nature of those songs strikes me differently in different moods, usually satisfying me and occasionally pissing me off. The title track is not quite what it's cracked up to be and I personally don't find it the best song here, which I would say is either 'War Ensemble' or 'Hallowed Point', one for being viciously direct and striking and the other...for exactly the same reason. That's what Slayer do best. 'Seasons in the Abyss' isn't a great Slayer album, but it isn't boring or the same as the last one, which is good enough for most.\n",
        "\nThe infamous Slayer has unleashed their first single from their highly anticipated album \"Repentless\", or \"Hannemanthem\" (as nicknamed by Kerry King) and I am thoroughly impressed. \"World Painted Blood\" was a step towards the right direction for Slayer, and this new single signals a bright future for Slayer despite the fact they are continuing without Jeff Hanneman. (R.I.P.)\n\nThe song itself is absolutely crushing and brutal. The main riff is somewhat reminiscent of the bridge riff in Metallica's \"Damage Inc\"; but it proves that Kerry King, despite the fact he is and always has been a terrible lead guitarist, can still write competent riffs. The song itself is a great thrasher, it sounds like Kerry was thinking back to the \"Seasons In The Abyss\" days, with the speedy yet melodic riffage that wasn't just mindless and aggressive thrashing, it is a refined, well thought and properly executed riff, similar to songs like \"Silent Scream\" or \"War Ensemble\". The song sounds like it could've fit right into \"Seasons In The Abyss\" or \"South Of Heaven.\" Gary Holt proves that he is the best one to fit into Hanneman's shoes; his leads are very well executed, and Kerry's trade off leads are actually decent, considering his leads are usually complete crap. Tom Araya's vocals haven't been this good since \"Divine Intervention.\" He sounds like he's young again, his piercing and brutal cries are a wonder to behold. Paul Bostaph is the weak link in the song. His drumming on \"Divine Intervention\" was incredible, it proved he rivaled Dave, (Lombardo still is and always will be the better drummer.) but here the drumming is weak and uninspired, and it only just fits the song, it doesn't compliment it or make it sound anymore interesting. It keeps it aggressive and rhythmic that's for sure, but it's bland. The lyricism of the song is a bit funny, but it is a worthy tribute to Jeff Hanneman. \n\n\"Repentless\" is a smart choice for a first single release as it is a pretty damn solid song, and I hope the rest of the new album will keep consistency with good tracks.\n\nEDIT: I had initially given it a number a bit too generous, the song is solid but is by no means a Slayer classic in the caliber of \"Chemical Warfare\" or \"War Ensemble\".\n",
        "\nSlayer has made a recent habit of offering digital singles as teasers/appetizers prior to unleashing their LPs, and thus far it has proven to be a very hit or miss practice. Perhaps it could be that Kerry King and company are just a little too honest about the direction of their upcoming album and feel it necessary to give their fans a full impression of what they are in for, and sadly this has involved putting out weak material that lends itself to a poor impression. Such was the case with the recent dud known as When The Stillness Comes, which came dangerously close to redefining the concept of a boring, plodding attempt at a half-ballad. However, this practice has also afforded itself a few opportunities to show where the current Slayer has a tendency to shine, and the opportunity was definitely seized, albeit not quite to the point of greatness, with their latest effort Repentless, which will be the title song of their upcoming LP.\n\nWhere this song succeeds is in its no nonsense approach to thrashing, assaulting the onlookers with a lightning fast and punishingly aggressive bombardment of rage. The riff work follows a fairly predictable formula and shifts between blurring speed with a few fancy turnaround points and that of a few elongated points where the guitars hold while the drums continue their mosh pit inspiring mayhem. The clear goal of this song is a full out reminiscence of Reign In Blood, complete with the signature back and forth lead guitar duel at the song's center, though King opts for a fairly tame and idiomatic set of solos that almost sound like a melodic hook at times, and Gary Holt makes a much needed guest appearance to provide some contrasting input that is actually slightly fancier than King's contributions. The only technical weak point to speak of is Araya's shouts, which while adequate, continue to flirt with being monotone and sound like their at about two-thirds the intensity level of where it was even back in the days of Divine Intervention let alone before.\n\nThe only real albatross hanging around this song's neck is that at times it gets a bit too close to some past works, namely sounding pretty close to a slightly flashier version of \"Flesh Storm\" off Christ Illusion, admittedly one of the better songs off said album and one that was similarly looking back to the mid-80s when Slayer was the most dangerous band out of the Bay Area barring maybe Possessed. It's a bit on the slick and well-produced side of the coin when compared even to their 2006 attempt at moving back to their roots, though it doesn't come off as overly safe and polished. Those expecting a mandatory fit of extreme thrashing as only Slayer can deliver will be more than satisfied with this song, though one can't help but wonder how much better this song would be if it wandered around a bit more the way some of Slayer's later 80s material did and maybe tagged on some additional changes in the middle of the song. It's a quickie, it definitely leaves one hungry for more (which works well in its capacity as a single/teaser), but it is definitely on the better side of the present Slayer coin.\n",
        "\nThere is an old phrase that says \"the third time's the charm.\" We now can see that saying in a new light thanks to the latest and greatest of the three singles released by Slayer in 2014 and 2015. \"Repentless\" is a mixture of its older brothers', \"Implode\" and \"When the Stillness Comes,\" best qualities with a dash of its own evil vibes. It was nice to see Gary Holt laying down a ripping solo. I felt as if his presence wasn't as good in \"Implode\" and especially in \"When the Stillness Comes,\" and here he can really, truly prove his worth.\n\nAt first glance the lyrics to \"Repentless\" seem generic and very much like the ones in \"Implode.\" After researching the song, I found out that Kerry King wrote this song as a tribute to the legendary Jeff Hanneman. Once I realized that, it all made sense. The lyrics fit the song very well, as the line \"Live fast\" matches the intense, fast riffing of \"Repentless,\" as well as Hanneman's lifestyle. Hanneman was never someone who liked today's \"scene\" and the song just seems more and more fitting as time goes on.\n\nThe music itself in \"Repentless\" was both catchy and slightly technical. It was so nice to hear Slayer solos that made me say \"wow.\" They were quick paced, relentless, and just tore through my ears like a bullet. The contrast of open power chords that were played over the fast drumming of Paul Bostaph and the pleasant mix of dynamics made this a winner. \n\nAraya's vocals have improved for the most part. Every time that Slayer has released an album after Divine Intervention, the vocals just kept on getting slightly more high-pitched and in my opinion, less powerful. But here, there has definitely been a comeback. \"When the Stillness Comes\" hinted that this was going to happen, and now it has.\n\nThe guitars are what make this song work. As I mentioned above, the solos were quick paced, and in comparison to Slayer's last two singles they were completely on point. It was as if they came from Reign In Blood due to their blistering speed. When watching a video of the band performing the song in the studio, one could see King and Holt's fingers just flying over the frets of their guitars. I liked the opening riff that the band plays. It doesn't sound like the majority of recent Slayer licks, and it had a creepy, yet fetching vibe at the same time. I also love it when bands make layered sections with counter-melodies and leads, and when King played the lead melody over the open chords of \"Repentless's\" end and beginning, I smiled ear to ear. This track was melodic, which some people would consider odd for Slayer's sound, but this proves just how well King, Araya, and Holt are at writing music. \n\nSlayer will be able to continue their success if the rest of Repentless' songs share similar qualities with its title track. All of the pieces are falling into place, and the future is looking bright for these four talented men. I loved that Slayer was able to write a fitting tribute song to their old friend. Hanneman would have loved it. The recent Slayer singles have been rocky, but at least two of them have been a triumph. \"Replentless\" is one of those two.\n",
        "\nSlayer came into the end of the millennium with all the brevity of Comic Book Guy shoving past patrons to get Homer and June Bellamy\u2019s autographs. Try as musical society would like, the Bay Area antichrists would not go down without having as much of a say so as possible, and if it meant having to kowtow just that little bit, then why not? It wasn\u2019t an unheard of concept (with plenty of examples to boot), and it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve kept up the unrighteous speed and blinding fury that put them on the map back ten or so years ago. No, theirs was more of a methodical undoing, a sort of \u201csettling\u201d that happens when people get older, perspectives shift accordingly and what once gave you that extra spurt of adrenaline just ain\u2019t cuttin\u2019 it no more. It\u2019s happened to all of us in all walks of life, and that seemed to be the case with this quite clearly\u2026\n\nSo this has been considered to be their absolute worst release and one of the worst metal albums ever. Well\u2026the first argument may hold water under the right circumstances and amount of weight behind it, but with the second, for what it\u2019s worth, that ain\u2019t true. It\u2019s really not a wholly useless release. \u201cDiabolus in Musica\u201d captures a few things in the Slayer camp, not all of it good, but as well not all of it bad. For one, the pacing and level of performance sounds pretty enervated; save for Paul Bostoph doing his best to demolish his kit, the rest of the band plods about at roughly half a tank. Not exactly \u201cphoning it in\u201d, but all the same not letting loose the demons within so to speak. That in itself robs much of the spirit from the recording, which I feel could have been much more beefed up if this was done by the Slayer we all knew and (once) loved. Guitarist/resident tool Kerry King once opined that, at the time of the album\u2019s composition, he/they were pretty fed up with the whole \u201cmusic business\u201d thing, which leads credence to as to how and why they sound so down and out (it\u2019s hard to care when there ain\u2019t much worth caring about, after all) and his own serious lack of creative input. Which leads to another thing captured off the album, this time in a better light; the songwriting is quite a ways improved here than on the previous outing \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d. Throw tomatoes at me all you want, but while \u201cDivine\u2026\u201d is jagged and uneven in many places, \u201cDiabolus\u2026\u201d segues from one riff and track to the next with a sense of logical flow, not nearly as detached in itself as it all progresses.\n\nIt helps that Jeff Hannemen was easily the better songwriter of the guitar-led duo, more inclined to rely on melody and actual song craft versus two-dimensional brutality and speed, and as a result you get charming bits of gristle betwixt the teeth in \u201cStain of Mind\u201d, \u201cDesire\u201d and \u201cScreaming from the Sky\u201d, though they as well don\u2019t short change you on the heaviness in any way. Just that\u2019s it\u2019s a heaviness that\u2019s easier to accept on the ears is all. Beyond that, the presentation of the album is also a bit suspect\u2026the production is really murky and unkempt, and while Slayer\u2019s never had great production throughout their entire history (like\u2026ever, really\u2026) this was definitely on the low side of things, a little less clear than \u201cDivine\u2026\u201d and not as bright and sharp as the next chain link \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d. The drums are snappy yet thin, the guitar tone is shadowy and dense and Tom\u2019s vocals, while the clearest layer of the bunch, are probably the worst offender of them all. I\u2019m not gonna say that Mr. Araya is a wholly convincing singer (heh\u2026\u201dsinger\u201d\u2026), but I\u2019ve not heard him sound so\u2026phony\u2026in all the band\u2019s entire existence. I wasn\u2019t persuaded in any way that he was as maniacal as he makes (made?) himself out to be, and at best he sounds mildly pissed as opposed to homicidally raging. It may match the general sound of things, but for lead vocal work they leave a lot to be desired. Was Tom just as wishy-washy as Kerry, maybe? Possibly? I wonder\u2026\n\nAll in all \u201cDiabolus in Musica\u201d is, I can admit, Slayer\u2019s weakest hour, but beyond that it\u2019s not a complete loss. Compared to the nu metal dreck that was knockin\u2019 \u2018em dead during this time (which many folks claim Slayer catered to with this, to which I wag my finger and cast shame upon you chuckleheads\u2026ain\u2019t no nu metal with this!), this is a far less inimical offering and, as we\u2019ve all heard, you could do a lot worse. As far as the band goes with this\u2026well\u2026you could always pop \u201cReign\u2026\u201d back in for another go. So there\u2019s that\u2026\n",
        "\nBeing the kind of metalhead who came to the genre from the most obvious bands of the day (\u201cmy day\u201d was the early and mid 00s), a lot of the early albums I bought from classic bands were not really the classics \u2013 maybe I knew the name and nothing more. So, it should come as little surprise that my first Slayer album was \u2018Diabolus in Musica\u2019, which happened to be the cheapest album in the shop. Some would say that it was rightfully the cheapest album in the shop, because no one is going to buy it, but I can see the merit hidden in such a release. Perhaps hidden isn\u2019t quite the right word, since this album doesn\u2019t exactly have depths to explore; however, it also isn\u2019t much simpler than the earlier Slayer albums, which do have a recognisable formula to them, the difference being that metal purists prefer the thrash formula to many others. Personally, I find the thrash formula a little tiring and repetitive at times, so I do not bemoan the changes made on this album, nor did I have the band\u2019s legacy to consider when I first heard this release.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve seen some accusations of nu metal (mallcore) dalliance being thrown around in relation to this album. I don\u2019t really buy into them that much, because this doesn\u2019t sound like Korn or Deftones or even Slipknot, who were always a heavier prospect in that scene. You can trust me on this because I\u2019ve listened to those bands for many years and, occasionally down-tuned and slow guitars aside, Slayer don\u2019t end up close to the same aesthetic with bouncy riffs or spooky vocals or sound effects instead of solos. \u2018Love and Hate\u2019 has an opening riff that sounds like something culled from Sepultura\u2019s \u2018Roots\u2019, yet the rhythm of the vocals \u2013 which may sound a little like rapping \u2013 is in fact the same straightforward delivery that Tom Araya has previously used, just slowed down for the pace of the song. The style is about 80% identifiable as Slayer, though several of the songs are slowed down and attempt the same sort of atmospheric riffing approach that \u2018Seasons in the Abyss\u2019 played with to some success. There are few out and out fast songs, maybe \u2018Scrum\u2019, \u2018Point\u2019, and a large part of \u2018Bitter Peace\u2019, while \u2018Desire\u2019 stays out of thrash territory for its entire duration and still ends up sounding completely like Slayer in the vein of \u2018Dead Skin Mask\u2019.\n\nWhile genre hasn\u2019t altered a great deal, some of the style certainly has. The band are mostly playing slower (this and \u2018Reign in Blood\u2019 are like the tortoise and the hare) and some of the riffs take on a groovier quality, with a rounder, less sharp, guitar tone and few real thrash breaks. The solos follow the same pattern and appear both less frequently and for a shorter duration than on the older albums, while the style is less virtuoso and manic. This leads to a million purists despising \u2018Diabolus in Musica\u2019 because it messes around with the revered style of the sacred cow that is Slayer. For me, there is no sacred cow, especially from my chronological perspective, so King and Hanneman simply need to come up with something special to induce excitement, in which they sometimes succeed and sometimes fail. A few of the riffs (\u2018Love to Hate\u2019, \u2018Screaming from the Sky\u2019) are boring and don\u2019t make a big impact, while some of the slower, creepier songs seem to be a little Slayer-by-numbers and don\u2019t quite have the desired effect. The drums are probably the heaviest thing here and so obviously do more than keep time that the nu metal accusations seem ridiculous on a song like the tumbling \u2018Point\u2019 or even some of the slower numbers. Paul Bostaph is always aggressive and provides even groovy songs like \u2018Stain of Mind\u2019 with a certain Slayer stamp. Tom Araya does a decent job on bass, though sometimes he plays too straight, while his vocals range between very convincing to very uncertain. Slayer lyrics tend to be lists, which suits some of the faster-paced songs, but doesn\u2019t work so well with the slower material.\n\nThe songs come as a slightly mixed bag and, depending what kind of relationship you have with Slayer, you may or may not find a lot to like. Classic fans will enjoy \u2018Bitter Peace\u2019, \u2018Scrum\u2019, and \u2018Point\u2019, and might find \u2018Desire\u2019 acceptable if they deem Araya\u2019s vocals creepy rather than weak. Fans of metal should additionally like the more varied numbers like \u2018Overt Enemy\u2019 and \u2018Perversions of Pain\u2019, the latter of which might be my favourite song on the album, with its slide between outraged and eerie. Verbal bombs have been hurled on account of \u2018Death\u2019s Head\u2019 and \u2018Stain of Mind\u2019, but I stand in defence of both of them. \u2018Death\u2019s Head\u2019 has lyrics with the word \u201ctrigger\u201d in, which doesn\u2019t make it into a gangster song, nor is Araya rapping, and whoever believes he is does not possess a pair of ears. The solo is a little cool and I admit it\u2019s not thrash, but whatever. \u2018Stain of Mind\u2019 is an unacceptable departure for some traditionalists, with its bouncy main riff and stuttering rhythm, though I feel the song generally works well and is a decent listen. The songs that I have not mentioned are of poorer quality and do not reward repeated listens.\n\n\u2018Diabolus in Musica\u2019 has been singled out as a Slayer release that departs entirely from the band\u2019s style, which is not entirely true. However, it does represent a dip in consistency that began after the end of the 80s, and some of the songs have boring moments and recycled ideas. I find something to like in most of the material on offer here, and the musical style has more of a general appeal outside thrash metal, but many will be disappointed by this album.\n",
        "\nFollowing up the somewhat sub-par God Hates Us All would, in theory, would be an easy task for Slayer. Considering the fact that the band let former super-drummer Dave Lombardo back to provide his talent for the record, and that the energy seemed right for Slayer at this time, that statement would be true. Slayer did surpass God Hates Us All in Christ Illusion for sure, but not in the normal mach three speed, fingertip flesh rendering, balls to the wall style of the 1980's and early 1990's. It was done with a more attentive, cautious, and groove centered approach that, in theory (yes, more theories), would never work at all. In practice this slower approach worked for the most part. \n\nI still get a rush when I hear Slayer on this album, but not in the same way that I did when I hear songs from Reign In Blood or South of Heaven. Those albums captured me because of their relentless, ballistic energy. In Christ Illusion I'm getting a rush from the intense emotions that the music is provoking. \"Eyes of the Insane\" is the perfect example of this. When the lines \"Got to make it stop, can't take it anymore\" the feeling I receive is sheer terror, but in a good I suppose. The leads and lyrics just send goosebumps down my back. Slayer's dark tale of a P.T.S.D. ridden soldier is a song that that gets under your skin, in all ways possible. \n\nThe list of good songs in Christ Illusion doesn't end there. \"Skeleton Christ,\" \"Cult,\" and \"Consfearecy\" are the other catchy tunes that do the band justice. If I had to pick one song of those three it would definitely be \"Skeleton Christ.\" The title is as evil and sacrilegious as the song sounds as a whole and the listener gets to hear another awesome rant/screaming session similar to the end of \"Disciple\" in \"Skeleton Christ's\" chorus. The lyrics of Slayer keep getting more and more interesting as time goes on. The lyrical content of only a couple songs on this record have been unimpressive. See the first two lines of \"Eyes of the Insane\" and the majority \"Catalyst\" for that. But otherwise, I was satisfied with what Araya and the gang had to offer here. Hanneman has to be the stand out in terms of lyrics in Christ Illusion however. \"Black Serenade\" features some perverse, sadistic lyrics that throttle the listener. \n\nSpeaking of sacrilegious, check out Christ illusion's album art. It has some similarities to 1986's Reign In Blood with the people's heads floating in a sea of blood and the color scheme of the reds, occasional greens and tans. Larry Carroll has done it again. He provides yet another cringe-worthy yet amazing piece of art for this spectacular band. I really hope that Slayer's fans get to see another great piece of his work in the next album that Slayer has to offer. \n\nNow it's complaint time... The best word to describe the album's leads and solos was underwhelming. I did not in any way get the same jaw-hitting-the-floor vibe that most of Hanneman and King's solos have in the past. \"Eyes of the Insane\" is probably the only song that has leads that made me say \"whoa.\" Christ Illusion's solos also sounded a lot alike and King and Hanneman seem to use the same minor scale over and over again. But to what effect? It's not consistency here; it's repetitiveness. For a drummer of his stature, Dave Lombardo should've been playing more wacky patterns and rhythms throughout this record. This level of (dare I say it) laziness is not acceptable for Slayer, who have proven in years past that they can just lay it down with craziness. \n\nI am pleased with this album's lyrics, riffs, aura, but not with its level of difficulty. Maybe Rick Rubin just wasn't pushing this group of titans to do their best like he has in the past, with not only Slayer, but with other groups. We may never know why the record didn't make the listener feel like he ran a marathon after listening to it, like most Slayer records. I am happy, but not elated.\n",
        "\nUndisputed Attitude is an interesting album. Despite being an album comprised nearly entirely of covers, the songs the band chose to cover here means that they fit very snugly with a lot of their original material, and it's a very consistent listen unlike the compilation-like nature of something like Garage Inc.. On this album, the band covers some 17-19 songs from punk rock and hardcore acts spread across 13-15 tracks, depending on your version. There are numerous names here; TSOL, D.R.I., Dr. Know, The Stooges and perhaps most notably Verbal Abuse, who show up a whopping 5 times in the track list. These bands had a major impact on Slayer's sound and thrash metal as a whole; specific examples being how hardcore-leaning a lot of Divine Intervention is and the stripped down nature of Reign in Blood. The latter is particularly evident when listening to this as Undisputed Attitude is the closest the band ever got to rekindling the spirit of their 1986 magnum opus.\n\nThese songs benefit greatly from being performed by Slayer, who are more technically proficient than any of the punk musicians that inspired them (they had been at it for 15 years by this point and they do play more demanding music, so that is to be expected) and it benefits just as much from major label production courtesy of Rick Rubin. The music is altogether very tightly performed and the sound is a clear and punchy one, with the guitars and drums simply being much heavier and louder than what those old bands could achieve. Paul Bostaph improved from his occasionally sloppy and somewhat off-time performance on Divine Intervention here; while the beats here aren't too complicated the speeds he plays at while keeping time properly is impressive. The riffs are tighter and heavier than ever and are the backbone of the album, giving each and every song a new lease on life. Tom's vocals are similar to how they were on Divine Intervention, a very hardcore-ish yell that while a tad monotonous on that album perfectly fits the shorter songs here. His voice is often distorted with a filter, but he still sounds angry and has a lot of power to his voice which is what is needed for this kind of music. As he proved back in 1986, he can deliver the lines on even the fastest songs in a ranting and rapid-fire fashion, with a lot of precision and control.\n\nEven during the album's most mid-paced moments the music is furious and driven, whether that be the rather dark and humorous re-write of The Stooges' 'I Wanna Be Your Dog' in 'I'm Gonna Be Your God', the menacing as hell cover of Dr. Know's 'Mr. Freeze' or something as simple as Verbal Abuse's 'I Hate You'. These songs give a nice amount of variety to an album in a genre not known for it, though most of the rest of the material here is savagely fast. Blasts of noise like D.R.I.'s 'Violent Pacification' or Suicidal Tendencies' 'Memories of Tomorrow' are utterly lethal and go toe-to-toe with a lot of material from Reign in Blood in terms of intensity. 'Disintegration/Free Money', a pair of Verbal Abuse covers, form an amazing 1-2 punch to kick the album off (the opening shout of 'Disintegrate you bastard!' is the perfect way to initiate the onslaught that follows), and the Pap Smear (a band formed from Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies members in the mid '80s) cover of 'DDAMM' mixes up wonderfully ugly, staggering mid-paced verses with a truly violent hook.\n\nDespite this being primarily an album of covers, there is an exclusive original song here too. 'Gemini' is a very unusual track for the band as it is in fact a sludge/doom metal song; it's as if the band looked back on their influences on this album and then took those influences in a totally different direction. Combining a fairly laid back but still ominous vocal performance from Tom with a set of droning sludge riffs, the song is a drudging and dark lyrical journey about the Zodiac Killer. Towards the end the song explodes in a violent fit of thrashing while Tom shouts 'Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart, reflections of my soul, reflections of the dark!' before settling down into the introduction riff. It's a dark and powerful note to end the album on, and it's a shame the band would never again explore this direction as this is the last truly atmospheric song the band would ever write and is one of their all-time great songs.\n\nUndisputed Attitude is a fast, fun, angry and violent album, one that is a look into the DNA that makes Slayer's music (and thrash metal as a whole) tick. It's a passionate celebration of their influences; instead of this sounding like 4 ageing men playing the songs of their youth to try and recapture it, it sounds like a group of musicians who clearly take great joy in playing the classics they listened to growing up, so much so that they beat out a good chunk of their original material while doing so. This is an essential album for any fan of Slayer or hardcore punk; in particular the Japanese version as that features the most material.\n",
        "\nAbove all metal bands, except Black Sabbath of course, I hold Slayer the highest amount of reverence. It\u2019s ironic that I use the word \u201creverence\u201d in this review and to describe Reign In Blood or Slayer at all. In fact the best phrase to tell about this record, the ultimate of the thrash metal world, is \"irreverence and blasphemy\". I can\u2019t get enough of the hellish sound of this release. Never has the album disappointed. The musicianship is top-notch, the vocals and lyrics are fierce and cruel, and the vibe Reign In Blood gives off is one of pure, concentrated, cold blooded evil.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the level of insanity that the drumming, guitar/bass playing, and vocals possess. Tom Araya has without a doubt, one of the craziest screams I\u2019ve ever heard. I guess others agree too, because his shriek in \u201cAngel of Death\u201d earned him his own website, TomArayaScream.com, solely for that scream. These wacky things also appear on \u201cEpidemic\u201d and \u201cPostmortem.\u201d His bass playing is unfortunately suppressed a little bit, but after listening to bass only tracks, I can tell that they are what this record is: Fast, furious, and murky at times. Now onto Jeff Hanneman, and Kerry King\u2026 I don\u2019t know where to start with these two thrash titans. The solos that these pair have to offer are mind numbingly berserk. Check out \u201cAngel of Death\u201d if you don\u2019t believe me. The riffs are more complex than on earlier releases Hell Awaits and Show No Mercy and have a much different aura to them. The best by far at the ending of \u201cCriminally Insane,\u201d the first half of \u201cJesus Saves\u201d and just about all of \u201cAngel of Death.\u201d And finally is my biggest influence as a drummer, Dave Lombardo. I think Lombardo was smoking crack while recording this record because some of his patterns are simply put: breakneck. If drumming reign In Blood songs doesn\u2019t give you blisters, then almost nothing will. In this album we see the first signs of tempo changes and some slightly progressive rudiments coming from Lombardo\u2019s kit, like on \u201cJesus Saves's\" third melody change. But most of all present is Lombardo's machine-gun bass drumming that is an eleven on a ten scale. Throughout the album the listener is beaten to a pulp as he whips their body into a frappe with his bass pedals.\n\nThe production is quite interesting in Reign In Blood and production genius, Rick Rubin, is the man responsible for the production of this monumental release. Slayer owe this man a debt for his work. His vision was to make a whopping slab of unholy thrash metal and his effects added to vocals, guitars and the drums were fantastic. One of the best things added by him and his co-producers was the infamous intro into \"Raining Blood\" from the ripper of a track \"Postmortem.\" A thunderstorm is in full effect with the feedback and roaring of a guitar and then the whooshing sound of Lombardo's kicks off the unforgettable opening riff of \"Raining Blood.\" Rubin was able to master the concept of splitting the sound of each guitar into one side of the listener's headset (if listening with ear buds/headphones). With that put in place, one can pretend they're at a Slayer show quite easily if they close their eyes and do a good job at it. This production is one of the biggest reasons why so many metalheads get hooked when they hear this album.\n\nI think that there is a bit to said about Reign In Blood's lyrical content, in terms of holding back nothing from the ways of the explicit. Death, torture, sacrifice and gore are described in livid detail and it fuels the flames of evil that engulf this piece of perfection. Let's look at an example:\n\n\"Pumped with fluid, inside your brain\nPressure in your skull begins pushing\nthrough your eyes\"\n\nThese words could be part of a Cannibal Corpse song and wouldn't hear a difference. Slayer's lyrics have gotten a bit too tame for my liking in recent times, but Reign In Blood will always be my go-to for gore-ridden lyrics of the 1980's.\n\nThe lyrics above come from the best song of this masterpiece and quite arguably the craziest thrash song of all time. Its name is \"Angel of Death,\" and it is the main reason I will never get enough of Slayer, ever. The song starts of with a tremolo based riff and then the whole band kicks in and Tom Araya lets out his fiendish scream. Then the off-the-hook drumming accompanied by some mean riffing. Following that is a groove centered riff and the middle verses of the song. But finally comes the moment the listener has been waiting for. The blood-curdling shrieks of Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King's solos. I remember the first time hearing the song dropping the mug I was holding because it was like nothing I had ever heard. I try to think just how fast the pick must be picking how accurately the fingers must be placed to play such a ridiculous thing. The trade off solo of hell begins and ends with the wild wail of Hanneman's guitar fading and blending into the turbulent sea of sound Slayer is creating. The song is perfect, end of story. Along with the song above, \"Jesus Saves,\" \"Criminally Insane,\" \"Postmortem,\" \"Raining Blood,\" and \"Aggressive Perfector\" are the best tracks of this release. \n\nReign In Blood Reigns supreme over all thrash metal records. If you think that your album is faster and more blistering, then think again. If you think that your album is more groundbreaking, then think again. And if you think that your band is better than Slayer, you have screw-loose. You can call me biased, but I'd like to see anyone try to top this blast of mayhem. It won't be done in our lifetimes. Trust me.\n",
        "\nThere is only one thing worse than badly retreading old territory, and that is badly retreading old territory while stripping it of any of its former stronger elements. At some level, any band will rehash a song idea and try to put a different spin on it, but being slavishly devoted to a precise formula and then simultaneously simplifying it further until all that is left is a canvass with a few stripes on it doesn't really lend itself to being laudable, save in the eyes of a cult adherent with a poor command of the doctrines of his own beliefs. In keeping with this, as Slayer's previous single Implode can be seen as a weak rehash of older territory, the latest single When The Stillness Comes / Black Magic can be seen as a further stripped down bad rehash with an example of what should have been the template for a rehash just to leave this band with even less excuse for it.\n\nBy way of contrast, rather than retreading the waters of Reign In Blood, the A-side of this wildly unbalanced single seems hellbent on reinterpreting the title song of South Of Heaven, minus everything that made the former the latter 80s classic that it became. The same basic elements are in place, from the creepy acoustic introduction and coasting verse part to the obligatory uptick in tempo and heaviness to a moderately fast wail, but without the strength or the mystique. The production is overtly modern in character, building up a massive wall of guitar sound that actually ends up further exposing the vapid character of the riffs being employed. This is essentially a dissonant doom song produced like a groove metal song, where the atmosphere is destroyed by the production being too clean to even pass for a poor man's \"Cemetery Gates\". And as a little icing on the cake, there's no guitar solo to break up the monotony, making one wonder if Kurt Cobain rose from the grave and took over lead guitar duties for this sad little song.\n\nHowever, things get an auspiciously extreme kick in the ass when the 2014 Wacken live version of \"Black Magic\" hits the speakers. Though it has the obvious effect of reminding both fan and the band itself alike that thrash metal lives and dies by either pure speed or something nearly as exciting to compensate for it, it is so well executed that it does make for an uplifting element in what is a sad indicator of where this band's next studio LP is likely to end up. Both Gary Holt and Kerry King do masterfully at tearing up the fret board, and although he obviously can't do his glass shattering high shrieks anymore, Tom Araya makes a solid vocal showing, proving that there is something other than age affecting how his vocals seem to be coming across in the studio of late. It's a strong testament that 31 years after the fact, the oldest of old school thrash metal still kicks the shit out of what has often tried to supplant it.\n\nSlayer has pretty much planted their flag on the idea that they are going to continue as a 3-piece until the end of their run in the musical world, but that by no means should suggest writing contrived rubbish that doesn't even highlight the technical prowess of lone surviving guitarist Kerry King. Considering not only the fact that this band could simply opt to go the Frank Blackfire or Mike Sifringer route and simply overdub some shred happy solos and maybe continue to use Gary Holt as a live backup guitarist to keep the rhythm section strong outside the studio, but also the fact that the older approach to thrash metal showcased in Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits is still pretty popular among younger fans, there's no excuse for recording trite like this. There's better thrash to be heard out of the latest Suicidal Angels and GumoManiacs LPs than what will likely come out of Slayer anytime soon if this single is any indication. Besides, just because a song has the word \"stillness\" in the title doesn't mean that it should sound like it.\n",
        "\nSometimes a fair bit of pleasure can be gained from seeking leftovers, though it will often pale in comparison to the full meal that was enjoyed earlier. That is basically how Slayer's final studio release of sorts with Hanneman still in the fold came out, leftovers following a reasonably solid, albeit less than spectacular LP outing that carries the same name as this single's A-side. It features a band trying to rekindle an old fire that hand largely been lacking for about 15 years, and succeeding to the extent that a band with a decline of good ideas and energy could possibly muster. Say what one may about the continued intensity of the live offerings, as a studio beast, Slayer has been feeling their age for a while, and it shows forth on the contents of this final testament to the now departed Jeff Hanneman.\n\nFor better or worse, \"World Painted Blood\" can be seen as an older, yet slightly less wiser cousin to one of Hanneman's signature songs \"Raining Blood\", only minus the creepy aesthetic of the band's 80s production sound and a lot of the intricacy that existed in spite of the band's simplistic punk tendencies. The intro riff, while reasonably memorable, comes off a just a tad bit lazy and contrived, though once things finally kick into full speed it finds itself in reasonably solid territory, though most of the guitar work survives by remembering the past than actually trying to expand upon it. Araya's vocals sound pretty haggard, but manage to get the job done without sabotaging the moderately meaty guitar and drum sound that dominates the mix.\n\nThe only real reason to both with this offering follows in B-side and World Painted Blood reject \"Atrocity Vendor\", which finds the band in a slightly better way. This is largely due to the lack of dithering around with slow build ups and breakdowns, hence what emerges is a concise, sub-3 minute speeder that is largely interchangeable with a number of shorter middle songs on Reign In Blood stylistically, and due to its rougher mix, also a bit more organic and old school in character. The riff work is fairly animated at the onset, though it does descend into a cliche mix of tremolo picked notes and 2 chord extended bangs that are just a little too simplistic for their own good, though this largely endures during the noisy lead guitar breaks and obligatory shouted lyrics that pass for verse and chorus. Overall, it's a good song, though it isn't quite up to snuff with where this band was 20 years prior.\n\nSome bands go out with a bang, others with a whimper, but when judging the Hanneman era of Slayer's closing offerings in this and the LP the preceded it, the result finds itself in an obscure sort of middle ground between the two. The songs found on here are likewise an exercise in getting the job done without managing to either mesmerize or revolt, something that is arguably uncharacteristic for a band that was at one time deemed the most dangerous band to come out of the San Francisco Bay Area. If this panted the world in blood, it definitely missed some spots, and if this was hoping to be some grand atrocity, it is unlikely that the history books will pay it much mind. Not bad, but definitely a small footnote in a career of astounding peaks and desolate valleys.\n",
        "\nYet another new Slayer track has been unleashed upon the masses, and it's name is \"When the Stillness Comes.\" What I was awaiting was a triumphant return of my favorite band and a song that would top \"Implode.\" I got the opposite. I'm not going compare this new song to older Slayer because that would be ridiculous. So any or all complaining in this review will be towards the song itself, not in comparison to the past. \n\n\"When the Stillness Comes\" is simply put, lazy. The closest Araya & Co. get to playing in the realm of crazy is Bostaph's double-bass grooves towards the end of the song. Other than the \"Seasons In the Abyss\" or \"213\"-like guitar intro, the song offers very little in the ways of groundbreaking or at the very least, energetic playing. \n\nTom Araya's vocals left a little to be desired. I felt as if he was going about them way too tame. He needed more grit, especially in the first verse of the song. They did get a little more abrasive as the song went on but relatively remained the same.\n\nAnd where was the solo?! The very thing that draws me to Slayer in the first place is their dissonant, distorted, and gnarly solos and unfortunately there is a definite absence of them on \"When the Stillness Comes.\" What are King and Holt doing? Not much from what I am hearing. \n\nAs for the live recording of \"Black Magic,\" it was like most live recordings, with pretty good clarity for all instruments, and fairly bass sensitive. Tom's vocals change a little bit when love but that's the way it goes. There isn't much else to say about it because it wasn't that terrible.\n\nI mentioned the word \"lazy\" earlier in this review and with lack of a decent solo, canned riffs, and an absence of some aggressive vocals just made this song a big flop in my opinion. I love this band a lot and I know that their level of absolutely superb musicianship could've produced something better than this. I give \"When the Stillness Comes\" a 7 out of 10 and \"Black Magic\" live at Wacken an 8 out of 10. I sure hope that this new Slayer album will offer tracks more like \"Implode\" because if there are more songs like \"When the Stillness Comes,\" then the new Slayer record will be an unnecessary failure. I think that we, the fans, should still be grateful that Slayer is still releasing new material, and at the very least accept the song if we can't enjoy it. That's what true fans do.\n",
        "\nAfter the sad news of Jeff Hanneman\u00b4s death, I frequently read that he had been the creative mind of Slayer. Additionally, everyone agreed that his death meant an irreparable loss for the band. Apart from the fact that every human being is an irreplaceable individuum, I do not share the point of view that Hanneman had been the considerably stronger composer than Kerry King. Of course, the blonde guitarist had written fantastic thrash metal classics. In particular, \"Angel of Death\" must be mentioned. Maybe the best and definitely the most discussed thrasher of all times. But what about the compositions of King, just think of rockets like \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" or \"Piece by Piece\"? Furthermore, when having a look at the here reviewed album, we have to realize that King wrote seven tracks on his own. Hanneman delivered only the remaining three pieces. But King was the spiritual father of the tracks that stood out.\n\n\"Christ Illusion\" was a tradition-conscious work of the band. Very critical listeners might have thought that the album presented nothing else than an act of self-plagiarism. Nevertheless, the band took a step in the right direction. Tom Araya and his partners in crime did no longer follow stupid trends so that lousy products like \"Diabolus in Musica\" and \"God Hates Us All\" were pushed into the background. Instead, Slayer remembered their earlier records such as \"Seasons in the Abyss\" or \"Divine Intervention\" which had been - at least partly - in close proximity to their real classics. In other words, \"Christ Illusion\" appeared as a distant relative of \"Reign in Blood\". Tom Araya\u00b4s vocals sounded very aggressive and matched with the violent and powerful riffing in a successful manner. His diabolic approach gave this album its special flair. Dave Lombardo made a perfect contribution, too. But I guess it is a matter of course that his drumming could only be insufficiently described by words such as excellent or overwhelming. However, his precise and stormy high speed performance was already well-known.\n\nMost songs were driven by his vehement and fast-paced drumming. \"Catatonic\", written by King, was the exception to the rule. This slow-moving tune possessed a demonic aura as well as an intensive and dramatic ending. It was therefore a relatively unusual sample of the band\u00b4s work, but nevertheless one of the best tracks of the album. Its doomy heaviness definitely left its mark. But as mentioned above, the full-length was characterised by brutal and straightforward eruptions in the vein of their works before \"Diabolus in Musica\". Already the rushing opener represented the return to the old values of the former thrash metal Gods. \"Flesh Storm\" did not reach the timeless class of the songs of their first three albums. But it could also not be ignored that it surpassed each and every track of the two previous full-lengths. Its ultra-aggressive approach was not at the expense of complexity so that it did not leave much to be desired. The following tracks commuted between phenomenal high speed and harsh mid-tempo while avoiding groovy parts successfully. The variable \"Skeleton Christ\" demonstrated the combination of high velocity sections and slower parts in a representative manner. But the best was yet to come. \"Cult\", the ninth track of the album, seemed to be a leftover of the band\u00b4s most glorious days. The song provided the connection between \"Christ Illusion\" and two masterpieces of the group, namely \"Angel of Death\" and the similar \"War Ensemble\". \n\n\"Cult\", also written by King, was equipped with the same tremendous amount of dynamism, vehemence and velocity. It only narrowly failed to achieve the level of the legendary opener of their equally legendary third album. The menacing beginning, the rapid verses, the mind-blowing bridge and the devastating chorus, every section of \"Cult\" was simply perfect. This carefully structured outburst proved that King was still able to create a song which possessed the specific DNA of Slayer. Finally, the sound has to be mentioned. \"Cult\" as well as the other tracks benefitted from the mix. As expected, the production was flawless. It convinced with the necessary pressure while being transparent and edgy as well. It also did not come as a surprise that the lyrical content could be neglected. Therefore, try to ignore the lyrics as well as the childish cover with the blatantly obvious reminiscence of \"Reign in Blood\". Just focus on the music of the best Slayer album for decades.\n",
        "\nOverall this is great, but there certainly are some big questions here, so may as well get them on the table. First off, why the hell does Metallica get their own disc, and all three of the others have to share one? That doesn't seem like it should matter, until you find out that their setlist is way longer than the other bands. I get it, their the big guys, the popular ones, but come on man, they gotta all be even. Another thing, at the end when all four bands were out to play \"Am I Evil?\", why were there hardly any Slayer members out there? Granted, the others came out for the big picture at the end of it. Those are my only questions with the DVD as a whole, but note that for the rest of this, I will break it into one part for each band's performance.\n\nBeing chronological here, I will start with the performance of Anthrax. This one was probably actually my second least favorite of the four bands to play. I love Anthrax, but Joey Belladonna's voice just doesn't seem to do it for my live anymore or at least not as well. If this was made in the year 1989 or something along those lines, it would probably be pretty solid. His voice just seems to be out of range a lot and there's hardly any power there anymore. Thankfully the rest of the band does pretty well, but then again you usually don't lose instrument skills because of age, and that's all this really seems to be from. I like the setlist they picked, all of the songs on here are classics, however I probably would have replaced \"Only\" with something else. John Bush was not made for this band, and Joey singing his songs doesn't change anything. Scott Ian, I will say, seems to play just as well if not better than back in the heyday. Something that is evident in slowing down is \"Got The Time\". That's one of the fastest Anthrax songs that I know, but on here they could not quite keep up the pace anymore. No shame in that, they have had an incredible career and I am glad the boys were able to re-unite to do something like this. To sum it up though, I'd say it's good, but just not the same as what it could have been years ago. Granted I wasn't alive all of those years ago, but you get the point. My total scoring for this one would probably be 67%.\n\nMegadave, I mean, excuse me, Megadeth is next. Anymore the band lineup means nothing to me because it always seems to change. However Nick Menza on drums is the exception. He is the one drummer that is superior to the others. That means nothing since he is not on here. Regardless of that though, this was probably the best performance of the four bands. Dave Mustaine, although getting old and certainly showing age, does a pretty great job on this. His solos and playing techniques did not go down at all since the '80s, and even after his issue with his hand, he still kills it. Same goes for his vocals, if anything, they sound a little quieter, but I wouldn't say weaker. Hardly ever in metal is the bass ever that significant to me, simply because a lot of times I can't even hear it. David Ellefson is an exception, because his playing is very audible and sounds great on almost all of the tracks. Megadeth still has it in them for this performance. I also love how he takes one break in all of the songs. While the other bands stop and talk to the audience, he does that one time very briefly before the track \"Head Crusher\". And that's it! No more do you hear them stop and do anything like that. It just plays straight through til the end, with the Holy Wars Reprise that they seem to end every concert with. They did something similar when I saw Megadeth live in 2013 with Black Label Society, Device, Hellyeah!, and Newsted. Great performace, and overall get's an 89%.\n\nSLAYER! You'll hear that a lot at metal concerts in general. However I can't say at this one I would do the same. I was greatly disappointed by this performance, and would definitely say that this was the worst one. For years Slayer were great live performers, but like Anthrax I think the age is finally getting to them. Other live DVDs of theirs such as \"War At The Warfield\" or \"Live Intrusion\" are spectacular. But this one, definitely is a let down. I'd like to see Slayer soon so I can say I've seen them, before they completely die out. Anyways, Tom Araya has lost all sense of power in his voice. Take \"Angel Of Death\" and \"War Ensemble\". Both of those songs have long, loud, beastly screams. He either doesn't do them or does it very weakly in this. He also doesn't sound like he always has his breath for some parts, and overall just sounds weak. The rest of the band did pretty well, but that isn't enough to balance it out to me. Jeff Hannemen has always been my guitarist of choice for this band. His was pretty up to par, however Kerry King seems to only care about how mean he looks and the playing sounds a little slowed down. Then again, so does the whole band. It's the age, I'm telling you. Something else, I thought that the setlist was rather mediocre. There was too much new stuff and not enough classic. They played nothing from the first two albums, but then again, I'm not sure if they even could at this point. Yet they could do \"Chemical Warfare\", so I don't understand. Also, like I said, almost none of the guys joined at the end for the \"Am I Evil?\" performance. Come on guys, get off your asses and get out there. You're legendary! Slayer certainly went below their standards, and receive a 50%.\n\nLastly, the band absorbing the most fame, Metallica. Their performance was incredible too, almost as good as Megadeth's. Metallica have always seemed to be ageless when it comes to playing live. Sure, they aren't the long haired aggressive maniacs that we all know of and loved in the '80s, but they still certainly aren't bad. The only thing is, I don't really see why they get to play so much more just because they're more popular. Regardless, most of it was pretty good. James still sings his heart out, and gives off that vibe of just wanting to have fun. Lars is still a freak, not the best drummer, but still the same guy he always was. The instruments are top notch as always. Really, there's no disappointments on this. They probably could have cut out some of the newer stuff as well, much like Slayer needed to do. But they make up for it by at least doing everything well and having plenty of classics on here to balance it out. While most people get annoyed by bands that talk a lot, Metallica is fine by doing so. Like I said, James always wants to just put up a good show, so him talking to the audience a lot is not a problem at all. Something else that I never quite understood was why they always throw the tracks from \"Kill 'Em All\" at the very end. They did that here too. Perhaps they just like to close on an energetic note? Hey, at least they did a great job with it, like I said. Certainly nothing like it was but at least they can adapt their old stuff well. I give this one an 88%.\n\nIf you like all of the bands, I suggest getting this regardless of some of the flaws, just because it is something that every fan should see at least ones. It has it's good, bad, and ugly (definitely not talking about some of the band members at all there....). It's also good for background if you have people over and just want a concert on TV. Mostly good performances with some weak parts, that's all I've got to say.\n",
        "\nWhen the Olympic torch bearer brings up the torch to light the rings of flames, they also ignite a new era in sports and determination of the human will. Slayer is not only is the torch bearer, but they are the Olympics themselves. They are bringing in their own new era of their music. Just like veteran athletes, Slayer are what up and coming metal bands should strive to be: Uncompromising to any obstacle or opponent, confident through all struggles. and not afraid to change up their style while still sticking to what they do best. I see all of these things represented from Slayer on their new track \"Implode.\" I knew that any new Slayer songs were not going to sound like anything from the 1980's, so I am not going to be ranting on about how I think that their change has been for the worse. Losing two of your band mates, one of them through death (R.I.P Jeff Hanneman), is going to definitely alter your band's look and sound. So in this review there will be no comparing to the past, only looking to the future. No whining and moaning that Slayer doesn't sound like they used to like a pack of crabby, greedy children. Just appreciating that they are still going, even after Hanneman's death.\n\nThe first lines of the song immediately catch your attention. They're melodic, and very dark. Then the verse starts and Tom starts to weave a tail of \"the ultimate end\" with a lower and more calm voice. What follows is an awesome 2/4 tempo groove driven by drummer Paul Bostaph. I didn't care much for Araya's higher pitched vocals at some points of the song. They seemed to be weak in comparison to the verses of this song. The solos of \"Implode\" are the perfect match for this track. They are a toxic mix of dissonant noise and high end shredding from Kerry King and new guitarist Gary Holt that is the icing on the cake of this song. Was the lyrical content and subject matter anything special or original? Not very much. Did it fit the overall message, vibe, feeling, etc. of \"Implode\"? Yes. It was interesting to hear the reference to one of Slayer's previous songs \"Disciple\" in the line \"I'm pretty sure that God still hates us all.\" As for the production, I think that Nuclear Blast is a nice for Slayer and that I think that they will deliver what everyone wants them to. The clarity of \"Implode\" seemed to be on point, and the only complaint I have was that sometimes Tom's vocals begin to overpower the slow groove at the song's start, and that Bostaph's hi-hat seemed to sound looser that it actually was.\n\nI think that the riffs were original, the solos were captivating, and the lyrics were okay. I am grateful beyond grateful that Araya and Co. are still making records and that the new Slayer record is going to be released upon the masses in the near future. Post-Jeff Slayer may not be the older Slayer that people have come to love, but the true fans of this titanic thrash group will show their colors by still supporting them through their changes. If Slayer takes this piece by piece (see what I did there) and assesses every move, then the new Slayer album will be a success. SLAYER!\n",
        "\nWhether you're really into Slayer to the point of carving the band's logo into your arm or not, there's no arguing in the fact that Slayer has had quite a huge influence in the world of metal as we know it. Their dark and sinister, yet aggressive work has paved the way for more thrash metal bands, as well as the birth of death metal. The band decided to change their sound a little bit when 1990 rolled around, however, toning it down a notch with the release of \"Seasons in the Abyss\". We have some songs that are crowd favorites, but others don't quite make the cut.\n\n\"Seasons in the Abyss\" is what many consider to be Slayer's equivalent of Metallica's \"black album\", and not without good reason. Slayer seems to have slowed down the tempos of their songs quite a bit, resulting in songs like \"Expendable Youth\" being slower, and some fans put off. Like with the black album, however, the songs still maintain their crunch and sinister tone, so that the only thing really needed to change those songs in any way is to simply speed them up. Unlike Metallica's black album, however, we do get some of what Slayer does best; speedy tempos. They appear in each verse of \"War Ensemble\", and although the song's tempo gets cut in half during the chorus and afterwords, it's evidence that Slayer hasn't completely deleted its roots. It's why if I was given the choice between \"Seasons in the Abyss\" or the black album, I would go with the former, cos at least Slayer's album has some fast ones on it. \n\nEven the ones that aren't fast seem to carry the haunting message that Slayer conveys. \"Dead Skin Mask\" has a sinister and foreboding hook at the beginning and during the chorus, something I would expect them to do, even if the song was about serial killer Ed Gein instead of their usual topic of Satanism. The band also has their signature chugging riff in other parts of the song, like during each verse. The song really isn't much in terms of fast tempos, as it is pretty mid-paced, but I can see why that particular song can be a crowd favorite. It's still got the characteristics that make up a classic Slayer song, except the speedy tempos. Again, if the song was to be changed in order to appease any nitpicky thrasher, all that would need to happen is to speed up the tempo, and it would be set. Personally, I like it the way it is, 'cos the forbidding nature of the opening riff really sets the atmosphere of Mr. Gein's Wisconsin cabin full of dead body parts and items made from human skin. \n\nAnother dramatic change Slayer has made is in the lyrics. Up until this album, the band focused more on Satanism, the topic that many of the uninitiated often associate with metal in general. It seems that Slayer wanted to break away from that common stereotype, as the subject matters seem to be a little less about the devil and more about other things. Instead, we get more of war-related lyrics as well as serial killers and insanity. Those lyrical themes were covered in Slayer songs on previous albums, so it shouldn't really come as any surprise. What does come as a surprise, however is the lack of Satan on \"Seasons in the Abyss\". I'd have to admit that the whole \"Satan\" thing is really cliched, but in Slayer's case, it's part of their charm. That charm still remains in songs like \"Spirit in Black\" and \"Born of Fire\", showing that even when changing their style a little bit, they still hold true to what got them the most attention in the first place. It's what pushed the rage buttons of moral guardians across the globe. It's good that Slayer still has it, for if the band were to get rid of their Satanic style, it would be like Metallica going country (look how well that turned out!).\n\nThere's one thing that I seem to find annoying that makes this album at a lower level than what many consider to be Slayer's greatest effort, \"Reign in Blood\", and that's the fact that Tom Araya tries to sing melodies in the songs rather than belting them out. Although he's sang melodies before, the melodies in \"Seasons in the Abyss\" all sound the same. Just listen to \"Blood Red\", \"Expendable Youth\" and the title track, and you'd hear pretty much the same melody. For this reason, I don't really listen to the songs that sound more generic, like \"Blood Red\", 'cos they sound like the exact same song as \"Skeletons of Society\", even thought the tempos are different. The riffs of those two songs sound eerily similar as well, thus adding to their clone factor. Even the songs that I would consider \"good\" suffer this, including \"Dead Skin Mask\", for it features a similar hook during the verses. \n\nSlayer hasn't completely sold out, but \"Seasons in the Abyss\" shows some signs of faltering. Yes, I do enjoy some songs on here, like \"War Ensemble\" and \"Dead Skin Mask\", but then again, who wouldn't? They're the songs that redeem this album from being recognized as a total waste. It's definitely not anywhere near being as good as anything Slayer released before, but it does have its charms. Even with these changes made, it's nowhere near as bad as Metallica's black album, not by a long shot.\n",
        "\nSlayer is one of those bands that is simply great enough to be included in any line-up of greatest bands, yet make it incredibly difficult to pinpoint an album that stands out the most. Sure, the general consensus is that everything from Seasons in the Abyss onward can be washed down the sewers with no one shedding a tear. But that still leaves you with a total of four classic album among which you have to pick out which one is the Slayer album, the one that ascends above the other, the one that soars into the highest heavens of lowest hellishness.\n\nSince you already know my pick from looking a few lines further above, let me give you a quick rundown why the first three did not make the final cut. Show no Mercy certainly has riff after riff (and no mercy) to show for itself, but I must say that, simply put, it is just too upbeat for me. Too \"moshing metal maniac\" and too \"throw the horns and drink the beer(s)\". It's fun, yeah, when you're a teenager and just discovered trading recommendations with strangers at concerts where everyone's in leather and spikes, in between the merch stands. That's the kind of album it is, the kind of atmosphere it has to me. A metal party album with not much more behind it. Hell Awaits certainly is evil, and dark, and sinister, and I understand why it is so many people's favourite. But to me it is the polar opposite to Show no Mercy. The first one has all the riffs and none the atmosphere, the second one all the atmosphere but none the riffs. Either of course is an exaggeration, but it gets across my general feeling about the album. Finally, Reign in Blood goes too far on its gimmick to be the fastest thing ever, and aside from select songs has relatively little in the field of memorable riffs or memorable atmosphere. Sure, it's fun to blast and hate the world when you're in the mood, but honestly, because of that one-dimensional character it is my personal least listened to among the classic four.\n\nSouth of Heaven, in turn, has everything. Everything I ever wanted from a Slayer record, this album has it. Every single note on it seems to be crafted to perfection. The album reeks of riffs, but never seems upbeat. And the album reeks of evil atmosphere, but never lets you down on intensity. Neither is the anger of its predecessor lost on it.\n\nSlayer, here, simply know how to create perfect Slayer songs. It's like they looked at the first three albums and said \"okay, we did riffy, we did dark, we did fast, now let's do Slayer.\" Because if \"Slayer\" was an adjective, it would describe the entire album. The songs are so incredibly well crafted, taking a good number of different bits for each song and just lining them up as a cohesive and ultimately decimating whole. They do it with such a way that if, for example, a song starts with an evil bit, and it segues to an aggressive one, the evil never fades away. Rather than part-after-part that you'd find on most thrash albums, everything flows into each other perfectly, everything becomes an integral part of a whole. And the whole is ultimate Slayer. The fictional adjective. And the noun.\n\nAnd it's not like they just did bits and pieces of their previous works into some kind of mosaic of the past. The amazing thing is how the whole thing sounds completely refreshing simply by how much it transcends earlier outings. Here, they create an atmosphere that has never been there before, with a large set of riffs that showed a whole new side of them, and that probably no one expected.\n\nThis band's first four album should however be enjoyed as a whole, as each single one is essential. But if you are looking for utimate Slayer, this is your go-to record. \n\n\n--- Originally written for http://droneriot.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nLosing a valued part of an institution can often shake it into disarray, as can be seen in the first outing of Bay Area thrash and death metal forerunner Slayer as they try to soldier on absent their principle riff master Jeff Hanneman. Truth be told, Slayer suffered a massive decline in quality of sound in the latter half of the 90s as Kerry King stepped up to do most of the songwriting and the band's sound drifted more towards a lackluster middle road between modernity and their original signature sound. The introduction of the first song off their soon to be 11th studio LP (if you don't count Undisputed Attitude) in \"Implode\" sees a similar situation to the one that has lingered to varying degrees since God Hates Us All, a sound that is fast and aggressive, yet pretty damned contrived and mechanical sounding.\n\nThis song could be likened to a stretched out version of \"Psychopathy Red\", lacking the sheer intensity as well as the reasonably busy riffing character that made said song a decent return to form, and also with a muddier guitar sound that stops just shy of aping Crowbar. One riff transitions into the next with little sense of cadence or elaboration. A mid-tempo, almost groove metal oriented intro that is probably supposed to mimic what was done on Reign In Blood nearly induces sleep in its just under a minute duration before launching into an up tempo, yet still highly predictable thrashing section. The lead guitar department has naturally been cut in half due to the absence of Hanneman, but King doesn't really do much apart from going through the motions, leaving the band sounding like geriatric version of Sodom.\n\nWhile Slayer's singles have generally been a decent indicator of where their albums are headed, this is a case where I'm hoping that it's a case of a misleading hiccup. At best, a song like this can only promise something along the lines of the passable yet largely uninspired Christ Illusion, which managed to distance itself from the garbage that happened just before while failing to truly recapture where the band had been prior to the 1990s. After a while, railing about how much you think religion and society suck gets old, and absent something to pump some real energy into a cliche lyrical pursuit in the music department, it's not really worth getting jazzed up over. Araya's vocals sound haggard, the riffs sound lazy, the drumming might as well have been exported from a previous album digitally, essentially the only way to ruin your spine to this song is by shrugging your shoulders too hard.\n",
        "\nSomewhere in the four years in between \u201cSeasons In the Abyss\u201d and \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d something was lost within Slayer. For the first time the band had spent actual time on pre-production. Where Slayer once sounded irrevocably evil here they sound\u2026 mundane and ordinary. It is an unexpected and jarring change that left fans confused. The most evil thrash/speed metal band in the world had apparently lost its way, and much of its identity. This change becomes more apparent by the band\u2019s change in wardrobe. Instead of wearing leather, inverted crosses, spikes and denim Slayer now wore hockey jerseys, sunglasses and tennis shoes as they opted for a more urban look. Kerry King shaved his head bald, and Slayer were desperately looking to hang with the kids that loved Pantera, Machine Head and the very divisive \u201cChaos AD\u201d by once-relevant Brazilian combo Sepultura. Not even a divine intervention could save this \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d.\n\nThis album is the recording debut for drummer Paul Bostaph, who cut his teeth with fellow thrash metal pioneers Forbidden, and it is as smooth as one can reasonably imagine given the unfortunate circumstances of how he came into the band. In fact Bostaph\u2019s take-no-prisoners attitude behind the kit is exactly what gives much of these fairly dull cuts their edge. The drum intro to \u2018Killing Fields\u2019 or \u2018Serenity In Murder\u2019 is equal to original drummer Dave Lombardo in terms of intensity and power. It is obvious that Paul Bostaph has a different style, and although he uses similar techniques as Lombardo this is a different Slayer. As the second longest-serving Slayer drummer the cards were stacked against Bostaph, but he didn\u2019t let the animosity get to him. The band was grasping at straws to hang on to the sound they worked so hard on to perfect. In the face of a changing taste in the mainstream metal scene, and the apparent need to appeal to a different demographic in terms of audience, compromises were made \u2013 and not all for the best. Slayer was a full of itself, and over-confident that anything would work. \n\nThe album starts off strong with the rolling drumbeat and kickdrum action of \u2018Killing Fields\u2019. The track slows down soon, and Araya\u2019s vocals are far more controlled than ever before. The riffing is kind of there, and it isn\u2019t. These mostly are characterless groove riffs and stolen metallic hardcore riffs. Araya\u2019s bass playing is more interesting than the riffs it supports, thankfully the killer acceleration redeems a lot. As always, the solo\u2019ing is the highlight of the track, and it is no different here. \u2018Sex. Murder. Art.\u2019 sounds like a surprise ending to the opening track, but is actually a song on its own despite being barely over 2 minutes long. \u2018Fictional Reality\u2019 passes by without a highlight to speak of, and \u2018Dittohead\u2019 is another explosive short song that is so energetic that it is hard to miss. The \u2018Dittohead\u2019 music video has Slayer playing in a crowded basement, and it is filled with news footage. \u2018Serenity In Murder\u2019 is much more colorful on all fronts, and has some minor production values worth mentioning. The band appears to be playing in a deeply red colored stripper booth, of all things. Bostaph\u2019s drumming matches Lombardo\u2019s rhythmic density, but doesn\u2019t possess the same creativity in terms of fills. The title track is a dull groove number that starts with the most enunthusiastic opening riff imagineable. Was this the same Slayer that penned \u201cReign In Blood\u201d? You wouldn\u2019t say so from hearing this slugfest of two-note groove riffs and directionless plodding. \n\n\u2018Circle Of Beliefs\u2019 is a good track ruined by processed vocals, which thankfully are abandoned after the first verse but return later on. As always the solo\u2019ing is superb. \u2018SS-3\u2019 is, like the title track, inspired in equal amounts by the rising groove metal \u2013 and Seattle grunge sound, and it is none the better for it. Bostaph\u2019s spirited drumming is a plus, but it does little to elevate a track hampered by subpar riffing. The studio experiments with the vocals don\u2019t help matters in the slightest. \u2018Serenity In Murder\u2019 is another short blaster that gets by on the grace of its abundant energy in the opening section, and the fact that it was a video track. The clean vocals in the beginning are nothing short of embarrassing, and if it weren\u2019t for the great solo\u2019ing this would be another throwaway track on an album that wasn\u2019t strong to begin with. \u2018213\u2019 has a clean guitar introduction, and has the construction and feel of a power-ballad initially. There are more semi-clean and spoken vocals towards the latter half of the track. Closing track \u2018Mind Control\u2019 is pretty similar to \u2018Killing Fields\u2019 but it passes by without any real highlight to speak of. The drumming and solo\u2019ing are great, but that\u2019s about it. As a closing track it is anticlimactic and uneventful compared to earlier Slayer records.\n\nInstead of churning evil thrash/speed metal riffs there are a lot of meandering groove metal riffs that borrow from the metallic hardcore sound that was all the rage at the time. The overall tempo is lower, but there are a good variety of slow and fast songs. Tom Araya\u2019s vocals are toned down, and there\u2019s a greater reliance on softer vocal cadences to fit the lower tempo. Araya doesn\u2019t sound as out-of-control as on prior records. \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d follows the architectural template of \u201cSeasons Of the Abyss\u201d but misses the vital songwriting components to make it match its illustrious predecessor. The band has grown into a comfortable state of familiarity with its style. As a result of this, they have become complacent and content with itself. \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d shows no progress in terms of songwriting or instrumental skill from prior records, but seems to tread water in a confusing spot that isn\u2019t here nor there. It does what it is supposed to do, but its goals aren\u2019t set exactly high in the first place. \n\nAs per usual the album was steeped in controversy with \u2018213\u2019 referring to the apartment number where notorious cannibal/serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer tortured his victims, \u2018SS-3\u2019 concerned SS-hangman Reinhard Heydrich and \u2018Dittohead\u2019 formed a partial tribute to Republican fearmonger Rush Limbaugh. In 1998 the album was banned in Germany due to the lyrics of \u2018SS-3\u2019, \u2018Circle of Beliefs\u2019, \u2018Serenity in Murder\u2019, \u2018213\u2019 and \u2018Mind Control\u2019. The fascination with World War II and Nazi Germany previously got the band steeped in controversy with \u2018Angel Of Death\u2019 off of \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, yet here the band unphased continue to draw from that black page in history. This is unsurprising as lead guitarist Jeff Hanneman is a collector Nazi war medals and memorabilia. Further media attention came from the Sepultura-Slayer feud after Max Cavalera accused Slayer of attracting neo-Nazis and skinheads. Slayer replied by calling Sepultura \u201clow life cocksuckers\u201d. At least the record was partly redeemed by the amazing artwork of Wes Benscoter and the inlay that featured the bloody, logo carved arm of a particular obsessed fan of the band. \n\nInfamous for its troublesome production that saw the band switch studios and producers multiple times during the sessions, it is the recording debut for long suffering San Francisco drummer Paul Bostaph. The sessions were tracked at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood, California and Sound City Studio in Van Nuys, California. It is a mixed bag of a number of truly good songs, two all too short singles and a bunch of songs that appear to be written to cater to a certain crowd rather than what the band wanted to write. It is a haphazard and confused record that can\u2019t decide what it wants to be. Written equally between King and Hanneman, it is King\u2019s material that defines this record. King\u2019s confused writing and desperate appeasing to the groove - and grunge crowds is a signpost for the band\u2019s future decline into mallcore wiggerdom and irrelevance. Slayer did not escape the fate that swallowed Metallica whole. \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d saw Slayer coping with the 90s, and undecided whether to stay loyal to their original sound/concept, or molding it to fit the then-current popular taste. As it turns out the album does a bit of both, but it is mostly remembered as the death certificate for the once unchampioned masters of extreme thrash \u2013 and speed metal.\n\nReview originally written for Least Worst Option - www.leastworstoption.com\n",
        "\n\"Divine Intervention\" was the sixth full-length of Slayer and at the same time the last album that could be easily associated with their fantastic early works. The band had not moved into modern times yet. Quite the contrary, it almost appeared as a return to the roots. The musical approach was closer to \"Reign in Blood\" than to the successors of this unique masterpiece. For example, the short outburst \"Sex. Murder. Art.\" was an indication for this thesis, not only because of its brevity. The riffing and the songwriting pattern were well comparable with their classics such as \"Piece by Piece\" or \"Necrophobic\". Kerry King had been the main songwriter on the here presented album and he had not forgotten the success formula of \"Reign in Blood\". To mention an other example, the rapid \"Dittohead\" also referred to their legendary third album. In contrast, the title track went into the somewhat more leisurely direction of \"Seasons in the Abyss\", at least the guitar licks at the beginning.\n\nHowever, Slayer offered one more time a musical assault that took no prisoners, although the magic of their early outputs remained unrivaled. Maybe this was just because of this special moment of surprise that was missing. As written above, you could more or less easily define the predecessors of most of the here presented tracks. The same went for the lyrics. For example, \u201cSS-3\u201d dealt once again with a historical person (Reinhard Heydrich) of the Nazi regime. These repetitions had not occurred during their first three albums. This made a small but fine difference. I do not want to be malicious, but \"Reign in Blood\" was the original and \"Divine Intervention\" marked its afterburner. One could therefore confidently notice that the latter fought a losing battle. This applied even in view of the circumstance, that the production team, consisting of Slayer, Rick Rubin and Toby Wright, had done a good job. But they had not worked flawlessly. The guitars should have been a tiny bit more powerful. The solos do not lack of intensity, but the guitar lines do not sound voluminous. Some might say that they have to be described as inoffensive, but I would not take it quite that far. From my point of view, the guitar sound was good, but not outstanding.\n\nIt was quite certain that all band members were fully engaged. The vocal performance of Tom Araya was well without achieving the brilliance of the early records, in particular that of \u201cHell Awaits.\u201d Paul Bostaph was a suitable substitute for Dave Lombardo, but it goes without saying that we would have preferred the incredible drumming of Dave. Once again, it was the question of original and (good) copy. However, the band was still capable of performing stirring thrash metal. My personal favourite was the furious \"Circle of Beliefs\" because of its unbridled power. Due to its forceful beginning, it drew me under its spell from the first moment onwards. The second crusher was called \"Mind Control\". While being straightforward as a torpedo, it finished the album ruthlessly. \n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that a stale aftertaste remained after listening to this record. Due to their previous outputs, the bar was just set too high. I am convinced that the band had used its best endeavours in order to fulfill the request of their fans. But it was just impossible for the group to achieve a better result. From this perspective, \"Divine Intervention\" made my day.\n",
        "\nSlayer has had a career of well over 30 years, and while that career has resulted in various dips and turns, taking them from blatant Venom worship (\"Show No Mercy\"), brutal thrash metal (\"Reign In Blood\") and failed attempts at commercial appeal (\"Diabolus in Musica\") three things have remained a constant in Slayer's career: they're fast, they're irreverent and they have passion for what they do. Slayer's latest song \"Implode\" contains two of those three requirements, and unfortunately, neither of them are passion. It has enough speed and aggression to pass as a Slayer song, and their lyrics are as apocalyptic as always, but they sound more like a band attempting to emulate Slayer than Slayer themselves.\n\nEven if \"Implode\" was a piece of songwriting genius on Slayer's part, there is a serious technical flaw that ties this track down to mediocrity: the guitars are too prominent in the mix, to the point where you can barely hear Tom's voice. I'm not sure who mixed this song, but I wouldn't be surprised if Kerry King had a major role in the production. It's by now well known that many in the metal community have their doubts over whether Kerry can successfully fill the shoes left by the late Jeff Hanneman, so mixing the guitars to near deafening levels would seem like the way to disprove the skeptics with some awesome riffage anf shredding. Unfortunately, Kerry's chief strength has always been purely as a musician, not a composer and certainly not as a lead player. While the opening riff is decent enough, the guitar solo unsurprisingly sounds like a child playing a couple of high notes while aggressively pressing down on the whammy bar. Say what you will about Kerry King, but the solo for \"Implode\" serves as final proof that Kerry cannot write a solo to save his life.\n\nThen again, Tom Araya's vocal performance isn't much to be desired for either. Don't get me wrong, Tom's presence here is one of the better elements of this track, but where Tom once shouted with passion and anguish, he now seems like he is attempting to convey the anger of previous performances, but cannot bring himself to care. The high pitched shouts of \"Implode!\" during the chorus are the only moments he seems to be having fun (incidentally, it's also one of the few times you can hear his voice over the wall of sound as well).\n\nAfter repeat listening sessions following a negative gut reaction, I have come to the conclusion that \"Implode\" is not so much an awful track as it is an irritating one. The composition (minus the mediocre noise that attempts to pass as a solo) is pretty good, Paul Bostaph hasn't lost touch with the drums, and the apocalypse obsessed lyrics are about what you would expect from Slayer. It has the makings of a good track, but fails due to what can only be a lack of passion for the material on the part of the band members. I can only hope that this is just a song to tide over the fans before the next album, because this is not the type of track to get fans excited.\n",
        "\n\"Show No Mercy\" came as a real bombshell and changed my musical preferences once and for all. \"Reign in Blood\" marked the album which influenced all following generations of thrash metal musicians. It seems only logical that these two milestones must be praised for representing the undeniable highlights in the discography of Slayer or even more in the history of thrash metal. But appearances are deceptive. \"Hell Awaits\" is better. Whether you believe it or not, \"Hell Awaits\" deserves the honour of being the best thrash metal album ever. Of course, one has to be very careful when using superlatives, but from my point of view, this one is exceptionally justified. On the one hand, it presents the malicious, aggressive, intense, insidious and devastating quintessence of its genre. While offering solely genuine thrash, it marks the only album of the first three Slayer full-lengths without punk influences. On the other hand, it shows an ambitious, highly motivated band that acts technically perfect, not at least because of Dave Lombardo\u00b4s outstanding drumming. Almost 30 years after its release this masterpiece of malignancy has not lost any of its fascination.\n\nAlready the eerie beginning of the opening title track left its mark on the thrash metal scene. The slowly growing riffs were more or less copied by great bands like Onslaught (\"Let there be Death\"), Dark Angel (\"Darkness Descends\") or Devastator (\"Maximum Destruction\"). Even after more than 25 years, the Australians of Hellbringer copied these riffs on their fantastic first full-length. Admittedly, not so much the riffs itself but the aura and the song formula were picked up by these groups. The same applies to the outro of the final track, \"Hardening of the Arteries\", which is characterized by its howling guitars. You find these guitars again, for instance, on the recent full-length of Aura Noir. All these excellent bands (without this list being exhaustive) pay tribute to Slayer and especially to \"Hell Awaits\". These points alone already make clear that this masterpiece left a huge impact on the scene.\n\nDue to the album\u00b4s running time of 37 minutes, each and every of the only seven songs had to be optimally thought out and that is the case here. Without being excessively progressive, the tunes offer an appropriate number of breaks. Nevertheless, they come to the point, because the focus is always kept on the songs themselves. Furthermore, the band does not neglect the necessary amount of sick melodies. I would therefore not change even the smallest details. To name but a few: Tom Araya\u00b4s voice never sounded more malignant, the guitar solos combine brutality and musicality in a perfect manner, the precise riffs work with clockwork accuracy and each and every tempo change increases the tension. But above all stands, as mentioned previously, the drumming of Lombardo. For example, listen to the inferno that he unleashes in \"Necrophiliac\". His drum fills are simply admirable.\n\nBut what would all this be without an equivalent production? The sharp sound of the album is dominated by harshness and transparency. All instruments - including the bass guitar, which is, as you know, hardly audible on some records - are well balanced. On top of this reigns the imperious and powerful voice of Araya. To my mind, the album has the same effectiveness after all these years as on the very first day.\n\nI have to apologize that I cannot tell you the song titles of the highlights. Some might argue with good reasons that the monumental title track is the best song. Some might prefer another track. But from my point of view, the whole album constitutes the highlight. And it goes without saying that there is no downer. Some eternal grumbler might be of the opinion that \"Crypts of Eternity\" cannot compete with the remaining tracks. I don\u00b4t think so. These wretched creatures always have to have something to gripe about. In my humble opinion, the song is perfectly constructed - do not get confused by its cautious start. (And do not care about the inexplicable fact that \"superstar\" Michael Jackson was given a place on the inner sleeve. Thank God, he was definitely not involved in the production process of the album.)\n\nThere seems to be only one reason why the musicians did not bury the band after this release, although \"Hell Awaits\" was unsurpassable. You all know exactly what I am implying. \"Reign in Blood\" was in the making. But please note: the band chose a completely different songwriting approach on this record. A wise decision. With a view to \"Hell Awaits\", \"Hell Awaits Part II\" would doubtlessly not have had a chance to achieve a comparable level. But this applies to every goddamn album of the genre worldwide. Thus, as mentioned above, you do not have to look for a better thrash metal release. Or to express it in the words of Tom Araya: \"What you seek for can\u00b4t be found / In sea or sky or underground\".\n",
        "\nDo you like Show No Mercy? Hell Awaits? Reign In Blood? Are you a die-hard fan of the early and more evil side of Slayer that was pretty much just straight forward thrash metal that also bordered on the lines of speed metal? Do small changes in a band's sound for an album or two irk you? If all of your answers to those questions were \"yes\", then God Hates Us All might not be for you. From what I've noticed, this album seems to be one of those \"Love it or hate it\" affairs. One could love it for how angry/raw the music sounds and just how heavy everything overall is, or one could hate it for those exact reasons because maybe one didn't expect Slayer from the early 80's to descend into groove metal territory and writing lyrics as simplistic and arguably juvenile in songs like Payback and Exile. I can understand the hate side, but as a huge Slayer fan, I've come to appreciate all of their albums (Yes, even Diabolus In Musica) for different reasons. \n\nI love early Slayer for their stripped down approach to dark thrash. The riffs were killer, the music was fast as hell, and Tom's screams were enough to make a grown man shiver. With God Hates Us All, Slayer has mostly stripped away the fast music that we heard in their first 3 albums, although there are some speedy songs here and there. Instead of straight forward thrash, we have more of a groovy thrash record. Some songs go straight for thrash (Payback, War Zone), some go for groove (Here Comes The Pain, Bloodline), and others manage to mix them together (God Send Death, New Faith). It reminds me of Pantera's Vulgar Display Of Power in how both genres are thrown in, and also just how raw everything sounds. I can understand people wanting evil Slayer over angry Slayer, but I really do dig the vibes on this album. I personally really dig the groovy riffage, as they make the songs more catchy and memorable as opposed to just being fast as hell, which can be fun to listen to but it can get a little tiring after a while. I see it as a breath of fresh air for the band, but that's just me. \n\nNow if you're just in it for heavy music and you're not nit-picky about genres, then I can assure you that you will probably really dig this record, for I think it's definitely Slayer's heaviest outing. The distortion of the guitars is what really lends this album the rawness that makes it so distinguishable, and Tom's shouted vocals, which also seems to split fans, make the music sound just downright pissed off. The lyrics, for better or worse, are pretty damn mad at times but you could argue that other bands have done it better. Songs like Payback and War Zone, although are damn solid for me, aren't very creative in the lyrics department and just seem to be angry for the sake of being angry. Then again, when you have an album titled God Hates Us All, you shouldn't really expect brilliant lyricism. \n\nWhile God Hates Us All isn't the strongest piece of music that Slayer has done, I don't think it's bad at all. Even as someone who isn't into groove metal, I can really dig the riffs and playing on this album. It's a different kind of Slayer, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's not like they decided to become less heavy, so props to the band for doing something different but also keeping their legacy of making aggressive music intact. Aside from Deviance being a somewhat forgettable song, everything else ranges from good to very memorable for me. The collector's edition is also worth checking out for the bonus tracks.\n",
        "\n2013 was a very turbulent year for Slayer, which saw the controversial firing of drummer Dave Lombardo and the tragic death of guitarist Jeff Hanneman. The infamous Kerry King has been vilified arguably more than ever for his role in Lombardo's firing and his way of dealing with Hanneman's death. In a way it does seem as though he's been trying to make it look like it isn't the big deal that everybody else understandably sees it as. The band now has Exodus guitarist Gary Holt and returning drummer Paul Bostaph in its ranks, and the guys have now released a brand new song to give us a taster into what post-Jeff Slayer sounds like...\n\nMusically, it sounds more or less like, well, Slayer's typical apocalyptic brand of thrash metal, although at the same time it sounds more like something from 2006's Christ Illusion than 2009's World Painted Blood in that there are slight nu-metal tendencies. The song starts out slowly with a chugging rhythm, before suddenly changing into familiar thrash-tempo Slayer fare. The fast riffing is present, too, of course. However, the riffs are somewhat weaker and much less infectious than they have been in the recent past, such as in World Painted Blood, and the guitar solo is nothing special either. Paul Bostaph does a pretty solid job on the drums, proving that he's still a very skilled and hard-hitting heavy metal drummer.\n\nLyrically, the song is also standard Slayer and concerns the ending of the world, but it rambles on a bit, and this is reflected in Tom Araya's vocal delivery. It's quite the contrast to the delivery in songs such as \"Raining Blood\" where each line is relatively short but effective (\"Trapped in purgatory / a lifeless object, alive\" specifically comes to mind), whereas \"Implode\" feels like it's just trying to cram as much as it can in a single verse. The chorus is delivered in Tom Araya's full throttle shouting voice, which starts to feel a little tedious after a few listens. There's also a clear reference to the song \"Disciple\" in the line \"I'm pretty sure that God still hates us all\" which seems to be there to persuade the fans that Slayer haven't lost their sense of identity. Either that or it's an unnecessary re-hash of past lyrics. Make of it what you will.\n\nI always had doubts in my mind that Slayer material recorded with Tom and Kerry as the only remaining original members would work well. This song does proves my doubts in a way, as it offers nothing new or groundbreaking and it feels like a step backwards from World Painted Blood. Sure, one could argue that Slayer is Slayer and you know what to expect, but after Dave's ousting and Jeff's death you get the idea that they have a lot to prove, and after this song I'm not sure they've proved it yet. Instead, there's still a clear Jeff Hanneman-shaped hole in the process. Dave has been out of the band before, but Jeff's absence alongside that has proved to be a challenge. \n\nPerhaps when the new album is out, the other material on it may be stronger and it may win me over. But as of now, I don't think \"Implode\" is the musical comeback Slayer should have made...\n",
        "\nLegendary thrash metal band Slayer have released their first song from their upcoming album. Following the sad death of founding guitarist Jeff Hanneman last year, they\u2019ve decided to perform as a three piece in the studio, with Tom Araya and Kerry King reuniting with Paul Bostaph on drums after Dave Lombardo\u2019s second departure from the band. \n\nWith these lineup changes it definitely made a negative impact on their sound. Jeff wrote a lot of their best songs, and it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s sorely missed, because the guitar work here is just plain dull. The intro is a boring slow groove metal riff, and it doesn\u2019t improve much from then on out. It speeds up a little in the middle with some thrashier riffs, but they\u2019re just as boring and just sound lazy, unaided by a muddy, lifeless guitar tone. The solos are just showcases of wah pedal abuse, and they just sound obnoxious and annoying, certainly not thrashy and face melting. Its not a terrible performance, but you want more from a band such as Slayer. Bostaph is no Lombardo either, and it really does show. There\u2019s nothing interesting to his drumming, he simply keeps rhythm, and doesn\u2019t play any interesting fills, or even really change it up through the whole length of the song. \n\nPerhaps their biggest asset these days is Tom Araya\u2019s voice. He\u2019s never been anything less than vicious in his delivery and leave\u2019s you hanging off his every word. Sure there\u2019s no screams like the early days anymore, but his high pitched yells in the chorus are pretty damned awesome nonetheless, his voice is brimming with venom and energy as usual. The lyrics are nothing special though, World Painted Blood had some great ones in Not of this God and Hate Worldwide, but these seem like lyrics that didn\u2019t make it onto the album. Dissatisfaction with the modern world, and lazy shots at religion, they\u2019ve done it before and they\u2019ve done it better. And the mention of \u201cWorld War ten\u201d is simply bad enough to make you roll your eyes. Overall it\u2019s a pretty average song, even for their later material. Great vocals as usual, but with mediocre riffs and lyrics as well as bland drums, it seems like Slayer is becoming more and more irrelevant, as sad as it is to say. It\u2019s okay enough that hardcore Slayer fans might like it, but for everyone else it will probably be passed over.\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\n\u201cShow No Mercy\u201d truly is a legendary album. Not only because it was the first such extreme and fast metal record ever spawned with the Devil\u2019s blessing, but also because it was one of my first extreme metal albums, which I have ever heard in my life, so I can say that its lethal riffing and screaming vocals has infected my blood and thus changed my life. It was in the end of 1991, when I have heard it for the first time, so it wasn\u2019t new anymore and there were more brutal bands and albums around, but back then I was still enjoying my Metallica, AC/DC, G\u2019N\u2019R or Maiden cassettes, when came this! Ha, many years later I can say one thing - it is not my favourite Slayer album, but for sure one of my favourites in their long discography. Maybe the problem with \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d is that if you look at the tracklist then you realize that along with some truly classic and excellent songs, the album contains also some better or worse fillers, with couple of songs, which just don\u2019t match the quality of the best Slayer material. Of course they are an integral part of one of the first extreme metal albums, so they have part in the history, but did such \u201cThe Final Command\u201d survive the time? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nThis album has a start like a dream and I bet that side A of my vinyl has songs, for which most metal musicians would sell their souls to the Devil, just to have the credit for writing them. \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d \u2013 maybe one of my three most favourite Slayer songs ever! Damn, I just love that opening riff and also that chorus part \u2013 it is a classic metal song! And then we have \u201cAntichrist\u201d and \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d and tell me if these are also aren\u2019t just perfect, utterly amazing thrash metal songs? For me they are. \u201cAntichrist\u201d was at the time probably one of the fastest and most aggressive songs known to the mankind and \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d has such a catchy, killer riffing and generally it sounds so damn awesome and memorable than sometimes I can hardly believe that already in 1983 someone was able to compose something like this, such an eternal classic it is. So yeah, you can see now what I meant when I wrote that side A of my vinyl is just perfect, right? And I say that also because songs from side B are not quite as good as those from side A, at least in my opinion. I don\u2019t want to say that \u201cFight till Death\u201d or \u201cMetal Storm / Face the Slayer\u201d are bad, because they are very, very cool and I like them, but you know\u2026 would you include them on your list of mandatory metal classics? Hmm, no. I think they\u2019re just like such Maiden\u2019s \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d or Metallica\u2019s \u201cTrapped Under Ice\u201d \u2013 you know, good songs, which are an integral part of important classic metal albums, but just not as good and memorable as \u201eRun to the Hills\u201d or \u201eFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d, right? \u201cMetal Storm / Face the Slayer\u201d is a song, which I think is more than just solid, I truly like some of the riffs in it and that memorable playing and singing. I know it may sound funny, but for me this song sounds almost like Metallica, with that great influence from NWOBHM, but obviously everything has been played so aggressively and furiously like nothing before! Awesome! Ha, I am lucky that my copy of \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d has couple of bonus tracks and first one of them appears on side B... and it is \"Aggressive Perfector\"! Damn, another classic song from Slayer!\n\nSide C meanwhile is opened by one of my truly favourite Slayer songs ever and I really mean it. Of course songs from side A were so fuckin amazing, but \u201cBlack Magic\u201d is \u201cBlack Magic\u201d \u2013 this is utterly killer song, with some of the best riffs, best vocals and best feeling ever. LOVE IT! But then there are two songs, which I am not so fond of. First is \u201cTormentor\u201d, which is just decent. It has quite simple, almost punk riffing, very simple structure, but it just isn\u2019t as aggressive as \u201cBlack Magic\u201d or some other songs on the album and is also just not quite as good. Then we have \u201cThe Final Command\u201d, which again has a strong punk feeling and NWOBHM inspired riffing, but for me it is just the weakest song from the entire album, a real filler, if you ask me, and I wouldn\u2019t really cry if it has never been recorded. I guess the main problem is that if you have such aggressive songs as \u201cBlack Magic\u201d or \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d then such song just doesn\u2019t fit here. It is OK, but I can again use my comparison to such \u201c22 Acacia Avenue\u201d\u2026 You know, you probably will never really like this song so much, but since it appears on such classic album then you just must live with it. Finally we have side D and \u201cCrionics\u201d opens it. Well, this is quite weird song, Araya tries to sing more melodiously here, what is a little bit bizarre, but the song is quite catchy, it again has some riffs, which are so much like Iron Maiden on adrenaline for example that it is amazing how aggressive some other songs on \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d are. That mid to end part of \u201cCrionics\u201d sounds for me almost like \u201cTransylvania\u201d or \u201cPhantom of the Opera\u201d, but I honestly like it a lot. But you can hear great difference between this song and the title track, which is next, and which is again an aggressive thrash metal attack and is the fastest and most vicious song with some razor sharp riffs and really unstoppable tempo. Thrash metal was born! Side D has also the second bonus track, which is \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d and this is yet another classic song on this vinyl; fast, aggressive, violent. Killer.\n\nRight, I guess I would probably have to also write something about the performance of each of Slayer members? But is it really necessary? Everyone knows how awesome guitarists King and Hanneman are, how well they cooperate together, how tight and precise is their playing, especially those leads\u2026 Sure, this was only their debut release, so the best was yet to come from these two gentlemen, but they already sounded damn impressive and most importantly, they came up here with a collection of truly memorable songs and classic riffs. Lombardo is the drumming master and if I can sometimes moan about Ulrich or whoever, then Dave has never been playing bad, he invented the extreme metal drumming, so hails to the master! And Araya\u2026 well, I can sometimes moan on his high pitched vocals, because I don\u2019t like them so much, but some of his other vocals sound really evil and vicious. His bass playing is sometimes hardly audible, but I can live with his performance and all in all some of his vocals on \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d are just good, some are maybe not quite as good, but it is OK. Artwork? Well, first thing, which you notice is that great huge pentagram with Slayer logo written in sharp letters, with sword inside the circle. Isn\u2019t it one of the best logos ever made? Artwork for \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d is nothing special maybe, but I can put it next to \u201cIn the Sign of Evil\u201d or \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d, if you know what I mean.\nStandout tracks: \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d, \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d, \u201cBlack Magic\u201d, \u201cCrionics\u201d\nFinal rate: 85/100\n",
        "\n1986 was a fantastic year for heavy metal. Thrash metal was at an all time high, with iconic releases coming out left and right. Thrash heroes Slayer were three albums in at this point. Also had one EP and a live album. They were starting to master their songwriting skills, and began to mesh as a cohesive group of musicians. \"Hell Awaits\" is Slayer's shining moment, but to devalue the monolithic importance of \"Reign In Blood\" would be asinine. This is their most popular work, and their most respected amongst fans and non fans alike. Is it their best? No. But it's damn good.\n\n\nWhereas \"Hell Awaits\" was longer and more developed, \"Reign In Blood\" is shorter and more chaotic. The hardcore influence is clear here, as the songs are short, to the point, and move along quickly. It has been said numerous times that producer Rick Rubin told them to \"cut the fat\", and indeed they did that. No song here is over four minutes, and after the opener \"Angel of Death\", they rarely go past the two minute mark. This is a huge departure from their previous work, and overall leaves a bloody taste of quick paced assault left in the mouth of the listener. It works, but the crafting and cohesiveness seen on \"Hell Awaits\" is gone, and replaced with ferocity and intensity rather than musicianship.\n\n\nLyrically, \"Reign In Blood\" subdues a bit of the Satanic themes and ideas seen on previous albums, and replaces them with more street level ideas of murder, war, and other assorted topics. \"Angel of Death\" is infamously written about Dr. Josef Mengele, the Nazi doctor who performed experiments on prisoners in the Auschwitz death camp. \"Piece by Piece\" is a twisted tale of a murderous deviant, and this theme in particular would be explored in more detail in later releases. There are still obvious odes to The Fallen One, but it's not as inclusive as their previous work. The cover of a throned demon and hanging imps and ghouls would tell you differently, but the lyrics on this album are slowly shifted from their Satanic themes, and this would be continue on into later releases.\n\n\nOverall, \"Reign In Blood\" is widely and almost wholly accepted as a landmark metal album, one that has surpassed the idles of time and become a must listen to anyone who ever applied the term headbanger to themselves. Sure, \"Raining Blood\" and \"Angel of Death\", or even lesser lauded tracks such as \"Reborn\" or \"Epidemic\" are hugely influential and all around incredible songs. But pound for pound, the lack of crafting and replacement of sheer speed for songwriting makes this album ever so slightly less incredible as \"Show No Mercy\" or \"Hell Awaits\".\n\n\nTo many, Slayer ended their reign in blood of the metal world in 1990, but \"Reign In Blood\" itself is a testament to the band at their seething prime. \"Reign In Blood\" is as fast, abrasive, and destructive as an album can be, and wholly deserves the acclaim it. So put on track one and get head banging. You have some blood to reign in. \n\n\n----This review was also submitted to sputnikmusic.com---\n",
        "\nRarely does music sound so truly and horrifically evil as it does here. Slayer took the workings they made on debut \"Show No Mercy\" and intensified them to near perfection. They honed their craft, and in doing so created one of the absolute greatest metal albums of all time. That album is, of course, \"Hell Awaits\".\n\nFrom the \"Su nioj! Su nioj!\" intro to the album cover of cattle and decapitated heads falling into a fiery pit of suffering, it seems as if the Satanic imagery and lyricism explored on \"Show No Mercy\" is comedically light compared to this. There is something truly unsettling about the introduction of an album being a group of demons enticing you to join them in Hell, but than again, what is more metal than that?\n\nGone are the influence ridden riffs, as now Kerry and Jeff are playing intense riffs that are now seen as the Slayer trademark. Tracks such as \"Kill Again\", \"At Dawn They Sleep\", and \"Necrophiliac\", hold some of the absolute greatest extreme metal riffs of all time in them. Riffs that are so iconic it's hard to really express in words how influential they have become as time has gone on. There are really only shreds of NWOBHM influence in these riffs, with \"Necrophiliac\" sounding a bit more old school British metal meets warp speed hellspawn. Now, for the most part, it has been replaced with pure malice and demon bile, thus creating some of the fiercest riffs to ever grace our blackened Earth. Kerry and Jeff, may he reign in peace, never really get much credit for their immense work in Slayer's early career. Sure, as time went on, things changed. But when don't they?\n\nThe real standout is Mr. Araya's vocal work. Devastatingly evil, and absolutely lightyears ahead of his time, there are growls, shrieks, and falsetto deliveries that must have sounded insane in 1985. Sure, Tom G. Warrior was UGHing all over the place in the early 80's with equally infuential and iconic group Hellhammer, but Tom Araya sounds truly horrifying on some of these tracks. When he says \"I have seen the darkest pits of Hell!\", you really do believe he really has. Again, as time went on, Tom may have lost some of his vocal prowess, but that's life. Can't stay young forever. But that doesn't diminish this performance or his current stuff. Because lets face it. Slayer still kills it. But \"Hell Await\" would sound a little less evil with Tom's insane vocal delivery. That's the key to delivering dark lyrics. Delivering them with the absolute darkest sound you can.\n\n\nIn conclusion, \"Hell Awaits\" is often regarded as one of the absolute greatest metal albums of all time, and rightfully so. This album so evil and dark it makes everything released after and before it seem lighter than a bag of fat free potato chips. As a whole, this is the best pound for pound release Slayer ever put out. Each song is a crafted beauty of evil and wretchedness, and each track paints a dark picture. One that has hung proudly in the halls of metal for almost three decades. You just can't beat this, and likely never will. \n\n\n----This review was also submitted to sputnikmusic.com---\n",
        "\n\"Show No Mercy\" is not Slayer's greatest work. As a whole, the band gelled more and became more ferocious with each release after, and in time would become one of, if not the, greatest metal bands of all time. With this release, they paid homage to their idols in a not so discreet form, all while changing the face of heavy metal while doing so. Not too shabby for a bunch of teenagers.\n\n\nMusically, as I said, there is a lot of aping and praising going on here. At worst, the riffs are second-rate Venom rip offs, but that's few and far between. There are some truly iconic riffs on this album, such as \"Black Magic\", \"The Antichrist\", and the seething opener \"Evil Has No Boundaries\". These riffs are often emulated by extreme metal bands today, thus completing, or rather extending, the circle of metal life. These riffs were based off the bands they were worshiping at the time, such as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and of course Venom. Now, bands worship Slayer and rip the rip off riffs off. It really is a strange idea to think, but that's how music works.\n\nThe real standout points here are the drumming and the lyricism. Dave Lombardo is and will always be one of the greatest thrash metal drummers to ever walk this planet, and if you need any further proof, listen to this album. At the time of recording, he was 18 years old, playing double bass at speeds never before heard. The intro to the closing track \"Show No Mercy\" is as difficult as it is iconic, and proof that Lombardo's drumming was far ahead of his years at that time.\n\nLyrically, the album is incessant in Satanic and evil themes. Far ahead of their time at this point, the band did what Venom did and, in my opinion, did it much better. From the album cover to the back, with Jeff Hanneman playing his guitar with an inverted cross, the imagery and lyrics were insane for the time. In 1983, most bands were still writing NWOBHM style songs, which never exclusively spoke of Satan and death, but rather other less controversial topics. Slayer took the imagery and the themes and put it to some truly violent music, and created a stew of Satan and evil. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman were the main lyricists, and the job they did may be seen as cliched now, but at the time it was both influential and controversial. \n\n\nIn closing, \"Show No Mercy\" is one of those albums you know is just a stepping stone to greater things, but it still is incredible in its own right. From the scathing riffage of \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" to the closing mayhem of \"Show No Mercy\", Slayer wrote and created an album way ahead of its years, and it still holds up to this day. That's the sign of an incredible album.\n",
        "\n...And I'm bored.\n\nI bought this album whilst browsing my local music store along with some other records due to how cheap they were, I never really gave Slayer a real listen before so I thought \"why not?\" My first impression was that the music was rather entertaining, but after a second listen it started to all sound the same.\n\nThe first 4 tracks of the album have immense atmosphere and \"presence\" but after that all the tracks start to blend together and they all start sounding the same. I've listened to this album from start to finish multiple times but the album continually bores me,and I always wonder why people think this album is so great.\n\nThe slower parts of the album are where it succeeds because of the groove and emphasis on the vocals which Tom Araya delivers brilliantly, but once the songs start with the thrashy riffs it begins to lose the power it had. And let me say this, the guitar work whilst technically adept is also very boring, all the faster paced riffs sound as if they're a record on a loop playing a recycled thrash riff. The music in the album often lacks a certain \"texture\", it seems to be missing something quite often, and to me the missing component is innovative bass playing. Whilst Tom is a great bassist, he never has any room to shine and show his skills, if a few songs had intricate bass solos or even some slapping and popping the music would be far greater.The album does tend to have some stand out tracks that stray from the average Slayer songs, Ghosts of War is the star track that allows one to rock out with their c*ck out, but sadly this and the few other memorable tracks fail to redeem the rest of the dull and mundane music on the album.\n\nAll in all the album is worth a listen or two but the music is generally rather boring and gets stale quickly.\n",
        "\nSome people always compare the new Slayer to the old and are then upset if the new album sounds nothing like Reign In Blood. But if Slayer would have recorded Reign In Blood over and over again, people would be complaining that they do not evolve their sound. So I try to see \"God Hates Us All\" independent from the old Slayer records.\n\nFirst off, the album is not too bad. There are those angry-as-fuck vocals by Tom Araya, who screams on the top of his lungs. His tone can get a little annoying over time because there is little variation, but if you've heard other 2000s Slayer, you know what to expect. The drumming is one of the high points of the album. Paul Bostaph isn't quite as creative and powerful as Dave, but he throws in more than most others do in thrash metal. His drumming is tight with fluid fills and lots of short double bass accents. So you could say he is doing the most he could do while staying in the restrictions of regular thrash metal. Unfortunately, the album lacks the probably most important aspect of a thrash recording: riffs. Yes, there are a lot of different riffs, but most of them are simply not memorable at all. They just fly by leaving me unimpressed. Lots of expressionless chugging, some badly composed and uneffectful melodies, many notes for nothing. Though, the few good riffs are capable of creating a nice \"fuck yeah\"-atmosphere you can perfectly bang your head to. Examples: Exile and Payback\n\nThe solo work is just 'as usual' regarding Slayer. Kerry's solos are mostly noisy and not very appealing to me, while Jeff's solos maintain some melody and point to them. You won't find his greatest works here, but as there are very few solos anyway, I'm not bothering too much.\n\nThe compositions itself are, just like the riffs, quite uninspired. Most songs start with a rather mediocre groovy thrash riff, then the other instruments join, then the vocals... you know it. It's nothing we haven't heard somewhere else yet. Probably the most exotic composition is Seven Faces. From the thin and spacey guitar intro over the groovy chugging riff to the powerful chorus with the slow riffs in contrast to the double bass drumming underneath, the song manages to be one of the very few outbreaks from the pattern. Tom sounds really insane in some parts (not insane as in insanely good but just really twisted).\n\nThe lyrics are about aggression, religion, murders, etc., quite generic and those kind of lyrics that aren't painfully bad but not nearly interesting enough to read them twice or even memorize them. Similar is the production: Compressed, loud, aggressive but somehow shallow. The bass guitar is inaudible as so often, the guitars are heavily distorted but have little grip to them. A typical 'modern' sound that isn't offensively bad, but also has little character and distinction to it.\n\nSo \"God Hates Us All\" isn't terrible, but it's not good either. Uninspired riffs and compositions on the one hand, well executed drumming and a pissed off and \"moshable\" atmosphere on the other hand. If you are a big Slayer fan or like modern thrash/groove metal (that's what I would call it), then enjoy this very angry Slayer record. But to all the other metal-heads: You don't need this. This has probably been done better by other bands.\n",
        "\nIt took me a while to warm up to Slayer. I was not a metal fan until I was in high school, and even then, my tastes were limited to Pantera, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, and Metallica. It was a good friend who brought Diabolus in Musica over to my house and made me listen to it. Ever since, this has been my archetypal Slayer album. It\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s driving, and it\u2019s lyrical content bangs your head into the harshness of wartime reality which is that \u201cmutually assured destruction will occur.\u201d Pantera wrote the song \u201cFucking Hostile,\u201d but this album is just that. It is a heavily infused thrash fest of destruction. Where Divine Intervention began to feel like a typical Slayer sound (my own opinion), Dialobus in Musica takes the band in a heavier and heavily refreshing direction. It holds its own in the pantheon of albums like Reign in Blood, and Seasons in the Abyss while offering a depth of heaviness not heard on either album. It may not be better than Reign in Blood, but it rips open one\u2019s skull in a very satisfying way.\n\nOne particular song of note from this album is \u201cScrum,\u201d a song that begins with fast drums and heavy guitars and tears into your brain with Araya\u2019s harshly oppressive vocals. This is a song that begins heavy and gets fast, bringing their signature thrash speed to their (then) current heavier sound. Meanwhile, \u201cStain of Mind\u201d is a song that MUST be played at high/full volume. This song is driving, heavy, and beautifully structured with brief refrains at the beginning of each thrashing chorus. This is the song that I would use to induct any new listener into the realm of Slayer. Even their slower riffs, such as found in \u201cIn the Name of God,\u201d carry a depth that only adds to the intensity of the album. The juxtaposition of slow riffs and quick-paced soloing delivers only the harshest of effects as can be expected from Slayer. When combined as a whole, the end product of this album is a wholly satisfying experience.\n\nCompared with the bands earlier achievements, this album fits very well in their catalogue. It\u2019s a mature addition that serves to develop the bands familiar style and lead into their following albums, God Hates Us All, Christ Illusion, and World Painted Blood. However, this is not a bridge album. It stands on its own strength, not just the fact that it opens the door for the band\u2019s following albums/styles like many bridge albums are known to do (Pantera\u2019s Far Beyond Driven comes to mind). When heard among earlier works such as Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits, Dialobus in Musica stands strong. The familiar speed of the first two albums remains while a newer level of deep riffing and vocalizations serve to expand the band\u2019s sound. In short, this is a mature thrash album. And therein lies its strength. It is an evolution from the bands previous mid nineties albums and a maturation from their earlier eighties albums. \n\nThis is an album everybody can enjoy. It bears the heaviness many fans enjoy while maintaining that fast paced thrash element fans of classic Slayer look for. It progresses beyond the stale sound developed from Divine Intervention and Undisputed Attitude. Finally, it honestly and wholeheartedly kicks ass. The louder the better, as I have mentioned. Do not play this album on your laptop speakers (which I am guilty of doing as I write this review right now); play it at maximum volume on stack speakers or towers. Play it in surround sound. Play it over and over again.\n",
        "\nUndisputed Attitude came out the summer before my senior year in High School and remained firmly ensconced in my cassette deck throughout that summer as my friends and I drove to hardcore punk and metal shows throughout the Central New York region. Like Reign In Blood a decade earlier, this album was everywhere and everyone listened to it: skate punks, heshers, crusties, straight-edgers, etc. Slayer brought us all together, hanging out and headbanging to what seemed to be a match-made in hell: Slayer covering hardcore punk, particularly some of the elite of the genre, bands like D.R.I., Minor Threat, and Verbal Abuse, all of whom we loved anyway.\n\nListening to this album is like peering behind the veil of what made Reign In Blood so iconic a decade earlier. That album took the ferocious anger and purity of intention that was hardcore and embalmed it in evil, taking an already speedy genre and amping it up to eleven. Hearing Slayer blaze through such classics as Minor Threat's 'Filler' and 'I Don't Wanna Hear It' is literally breathtaking, in that they retain the essence of Minor Threat's self-righteous anger while still retaining their own signature thrash aggression. Slayer can only sound like Slayer in the end, even when performing a near-Xerox caliber cover. \n\nAnd the bands selected here were all vital influences in the early architecture of Slayer. Hell, two of the tracks on here ('Ddamn'; 'Can't Stand You') are from Pap Smear, Dave & Jeff's short-lived punk band with members of Suicidal Tendencies. Which makes Dave's lack of appearance here on drums all the more disheartening. Paul Bostaph is a perfectly adequate drummer but Dave would've rocked the shit out of these tunes. The rest of the band sounds good enough, though Tom's vocals sometimes take on an over-distorted tone that swamps the power of his vocals. \n\nAs with most hardcore punk oriented albums, things start to blur together -- there's only so much you can do with three chords. Given their more precise and technical nature, the band naturally both speeds up and tightens up these tunes (and changes the occasional word-or-two), which some purists turned up their noses to. Fuck 'em! Slayer rubs their noses in it by being punk as fuck yet metal as death. And if you needed a quick reminder of the Slayer's other side, the South Of Heaven side, there's always 'Gemini' -- a slow-groove, brooding piece of atmospheric doom that always left my less metal inclined friends slack-jawed. Slayer forever!\n",
        "\nSeasons In The Abyss completes Slayer's triptych of albums for Def American with Rick Rubin at the helm. And like the previous South Of Heaven and Reign In Blood, Seasons consolidates gains made previously and has stood the weathering effects of time with ease. That it is not quite as good as those previous two albums is no real knock against it, though it does falter on the precipice of being Slayer's last truly great record.\n\nSlayer truly flourished under Rick Rubin, trimming the fat, dialing back the effects and just going for the jugular with a bone-dry/air-tight production that has really stood the test of time. Whereas other late 80's thrash albums have a dated feel in their production, Seasons just rips from the first note of 'War Ensemble' onward. And 'War Ensemble' is a totally whiplash inducing evil thrash monster. Written (like all of Slayer's best tracks) by Jeff Hanneman, it blasts forth like artillery, harkening back to the nastiest tracks off Reign In Blood yet betraying a further depth of Hanneman refining his hardcore punk leanings into trickier metal territories. 'Blood Red' is a nice slowdown into atmospheric darkness, showing Slayer operating in Hegelian synthesis with their previous two records, though one could argue that the continuing alternations between brutal thrash and slower grooving numbers gets a little monotonous over a slightly padded 42min run time. I find that a minor quibble personally as the songwriting here is generally excellent.\n\nTo pick at the one minor scab that keeps Seasons from outright classic perfection, it would be the slightly dreary 'Skeletons Of Society,' with its relatively bland mid-tempo riffs extended past the point of redundancy -- a minimalist, low-brow groove that would sadly haunt this band for the rest of their career. Otherwise though, its all winners. True favorites over the years include 'Spirit In Black,' a galloping onslaught of thunderous thrash and primitive grooves. This tracks grows through several different iterations and is absolutely blazing by the finish. 'Dead Skin Mask' is as catchy as it is creepy, highlighting Slayer's bizarre fascination with the most disturbed mindsets. 'Temptation' is also killer, though different from the norm, focusing on heavily accentuated hardcore/crossover grooves of the NYHC variety. Written by King, 'Temptation' points the way toward a better incorporation of these influences than what actually came to pass from his pen. \n\nThe masterpiece though is the title track, six-minutes and thirty-six seconds of Stygian darkness culled from the depths of Hanneman's songwriting ability. This was the track that originally got me into Slayer with frightened baby-steps towards a band that in 1990 was still utterly terrifying to those of us unexposed to true metal. Perfectly coupled to Hanneman's morosely parched and dying sounds are Araya's lyrics of sanity lost amid ritual sacrifice. The lyrics throughout the album are particularly sharp and diverse, tackling everything from otherworldly horror to modern-day warfare to late-80's cultural alienation. \n\nWith Jeff Hanneman's passing fresh on the mind, this record becomes even more poignant for as it stands, Seasons In The Abyss completes a three album run of excellence nearly unrivaled in all of metal. Despite later declines, inner-feuds and departures, and underwhelming returns, one truth remains: these early albums are utterly unfuckwithable. Slayer forever!\n",
        "\nJust over a year after Slayer\u2019s tenth album World Painted Blood was released, its titular single was rereleased in order to present a final unreleased cut from the album sessions. Similar to how \u201cThe Final Six\u201d had not been completed in time to make the original release of Christ Illusion (indeed, it was the album\u2019s original title track), \u201cAtrocity Vendor\u201d is otherwise unavailable except as a B-Side on this here vinyl single. Have you generally enjoyed what Slayer has released in the last ten years or so? Then you may proceed without caution.\n\n\u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d is one of the slow cookers off the album named for it, composed by Jeff Hanneman with Tom Araya assisting in the lyrical department. There\u2019s nearly a minute of slow buildup and harmonies as prelude, probably intended to evoke sweet memories of \u201cHell Awaits\u201d but falling flat of this aim. But just as anxiety starts setting in, the first real riff (and what a riff!) kicks in and we\u2019re off, folks, on the hate train to Thrashland. The tempo here, even during the fast bits, is intentionally restrained to maximize the chugging clarity of the main riff set. This makes for a rather curious opener for a Slayer release and one that I did not come to appreciate on the first several listens. But the track hops around between all sorts of tempos (Dave Lombardo showing off, as usual, and doing so quite impressively, also as usual) over its run time and though it\u2019s a bit weak lyrically (there\u2019s a spoken bit incorporated that doesn\u2019t quite sound as sinister as was probably intended), has good dynamics and enough memorable chunks to constitute playability. I\u2019d rather have had a rerelease of the vicious \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d or the evocative \u201cBeauty Through Order, but this will do; after all, it\u2019s not the point here.\n\n\u201cAtrocity Vendor\u201d is the point of this package, a glimmer of which you may have gotten to hear if you, like I, managed to suffer through that whole \u201cPlaying with Dolls film\u201d abomination off the World Painted Blood special edition. It\u2019s Kerry King\u2019s final composition for the album and remarkably, the first thirty seconds or so are pure old-school fan service: I\u2019d have crapped my pants had he written the rest of the song in this vein. But no, afterwards it kicks into a minimalistic modern Slayer affair, similar in tempo to \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d and just as rife with Dave Lombardo\u2019s constant beat alterations. Blazing speed one second, repressed chugging the next, bouncy mid-paced the next, then oh shit, back to the speed again\u2026it\u2019s hard to headbang when the beat changes every couple of bars, eh? If we\u2019re talking steak, the piece as a whole is rather gristly, but once again, there\u2019s enough juicy bits to keep it palatable and hey, some of us enjoy the gristle anyway. Lyrics for this one are impossibly, horribly cheesy, but I\u2019m willing to admit that they\u2019re so awful they\u2019re hilariously brilliant again, much like the enjoyably ridiculous \u201cPayback\u201d from God Hates Us All, one of but precious few bright spots there. Just like with the A-side, Tom Araya shrieking his head off can sell just about any Kerry King lyrical buffoonery any day of the week.\n\nBut considering that most metalheads don\u2019t give a shit about new Slayer recordings anymore, buying them just to bitch about throwing their money away, this is hardly recommendable for everybody. But for those that have been on the level since Lombardo\u2019s triumphant return, \u201cAtrocity Vendor\u201d is a worthy addition to the latter day Slayer discography. And at the very least, it\u2019s probably the last time you\u2019ll get to hear Jeff Hanneman wring concentrated hellfire out of an electric guitar: as of yesterday morning, he\u2019s no longer among us. I wouldn\u2019t have picked up a guitar, nor would I be wasting countless hours of my life on the internet writing stupid paragraphs littered with parenthetical asides had Jeff not written the greatest goddamn riffs, songs, and albums I\u2019ve heard in my brief, unworthy life. This single, while not the ideal requiem for an astounding, exceptional career, is nonetheless conclusive evidence that, a quarter of a century after hitting the scene, the man still had it going for him. That alone justifies a listen here.\n\n\n\u201cWhat I am, what I want, I\u2019m only after death.\u201d \n\nI hope so, brother. Rest in peace. (5/2/2013)\n",
        "\nAfter 4 classic albums, each one being a cornerstone in defining what now we call thrash, speed, and death metal, according to a lot of fans, Slayer reached their peak with the fifth album, \"Seasons in the Abyss\", which is without a doubt a nearly flawless record where even the \"fillers\" (\"Skeletons of Society\", \"Temptation\", and \"Expendable Youth\") were almost at the same level of the \"classics\" (\"Dead Skin Mask\", \"War Ensemble\" and the title track). Also, that album probably draws an accurate picture of their most cohesive effort as a band, with Hanneman, King, and Araya all contributing ideas almost equally and Lombardo achieving his most amazing performance.\n\n\"Divine Intervention\", on the other hand, was written, recorded, and released when the band started being dysfunctional. The album took 4 long years to be released, a time span when they lost the services of Dave Lombardo, changing recording methods with only one guitarist (King) actually recording all rhythms. \n\nWell, that's not unusual; if you're familiar with Metallica you should know that Hammett only recorded his solos on \"...And Justice For All\" (with Hetfield taking care of all remaining guitars), but Jeff Hanneman (the key songwriter on all past albums) being absent from most of the writing credits along with his minimal contributions in the studio were clear signs of something going terribly wrong within Slayer's camp at that point.\n\nTalking about the songs, well, there's not a single track standing out as an \"instant classic\". Maybe some riffing on \"SSIII\", \"Mind Control\", and \"213\" may grasp your attention, but most of the sick melodies, astounding riffs, and chilling guitar harmonies of the previous albums have been replaced by chugging on the bottom string and extreme, yet really schematic drumming as you can hear on the opener \"Killing Fields\".\n\nTo add insult to injury, the production does nothing to revive the uninspired songwriting; guitars are thin and buried under deflagrating drums, showing at least the excellent talents of Paul Bostaph, who tries his best to save whatever possible. Bass, as always, is completely inaudible. \n\nAraya's performance on vocals is barely sufficient. He's really high in the mix and often uses a yelled singing style, especially on \"Dittohead\", which sounds like a D.R.I. or Nuclear Assault leftover and is likely the most well-known track of the album. \n\nIn conclusion, I think that \"Divine Intervention\" is somewhat comparable to Maiden's \"No Prayer for the Dying\" - a disappointing record after the last real masterpiece of a great band. \n\nThe fact that they didn't give up to grunge and kept on thrashing in those dark times will always be a merit and a monument to Slayer's integrity, but can't be a redeeming feature for a release that, by Slayer standards, is quite mediocre.\n",
        "\nThat Slayer's later material is not on par with their earlier recordings is not an opinion, but a fact. Indeed, to compare the return to thrash album Christ Illusion with such great albums as Hell Awaits or Reign In Blood borders on ridiculous, simply for the fact that the industry outgrew Slayer. That, in my opinion, is why Slayer's more modern albums do not get anywhere near the praise their first five albums garnered. They have to date released ten studio albums and are in the process of recording their next one. Their modern albums do not get any praise whatsoever and are considered to be really poor.\n\nHowever, their last album, World Painted Blood, in my eyes, is a solid enough album. I never understood the hate that gets thrown upon this album, and never will do. World Painted Blood contains all the things that Seasons In The Abyss, their last \"great\" album, had. There was the mixture of incredible speed and slower, chugging numbers. There was also the mildly technical guitar work and the frantic fretwork during the tuneless solos. However, the industry left Slayer behind, as thrash died. Slayer were a thrash band, but thrash ceased to need one single fastest, most aggressive band. Since Slayer, there were far more evil sounding bands, and much heavier ones, and therefore, the industry no longer needed Slayer. But Slayer were still alive.\n\nIn fact, the blisteringly fast opener World Painted Blood proves straight away that Slayer are as intense and heavy as they have ever been, and Tom Araya's insane screeching over the top showcases perfectly the energy that the band had in the prime of thrash metal. This is how Slayer should sound, not the nu-metal garbage put out on Diabolus In Musica, this is raw aggression in its finest form, with hate filled lyrics spat out with venom, and great tremolo riffing to accompany it, with Dave Lombardo's speedy drumming as good as it ever was. And if you thought the band was done with just one thrash number, guess again. Unit 731 has riffs aplenty flying all around, with sickening lyrics fired off with murderous intent and one of the best drum performances since Seasons In The Abyss from Dave Lombardo. For all those who said Slayer was dead around the time of Diabolus In Musica or God Hates Us All, take a listen to the talent on display here, and remember the band you used to love, for they are all back in action now.\n\nThe single off of the album, Psychopathy Red, is a short song, that delivers the message in little over 2 minutes, but remains one of the high points of the album. The drumming to this is absolutely top notch, the guitar work is insanely fast and sheer incredible, the vocals are as pissed off as Tom Araya has ever sounded, and there is even a brief snippet of a bass solo thrown in when Kerry and Jeff rest their fingers. This is one of the finer songs from new Slayer, and is a very good one to thrash your neck to. Hate Worldwide, Not Of This God and Public Display Of Dismemberment and Snuff are four straight up, balls to the wall thrashers that rip the listeners face clean off as Tom Araya threatened to on the song \"Exile\" from God Hates Us All. The fast songs on here are all aggressive, and whirl past in just the right amount of time. However, many a Slayer fan will no doubt wish to hear of the quality of the slower numbers.\n\nHuman Strain is alright for the first minute, but after that it starts to drag on too long, with the same riff being repeated for far too long, and becomes snooze-inducing. Playing With Dolls is slightly above average, with the weird guitar lines, good lyrics and demonic shouting from Tom Araya as well as some singing for once. Americon, however, may well be the worst song the band has ever put out, with some silly lyrics, boring guitar work and even sub-par drumming. The song is completely one dimensional, predictable, and flat. The production is also not the finest out there with some rather poor guitar tones and the drums feel empty with no reverb on them whatsoever.\n\nFor all the praise i have given this album, it is by no means perfect. The slower paced material really does drag this down from the upper echelons of the Slayer discography. However, it is nice to hear Slayer sounding like they did in the 1980's, but also a shame that they will never enjoy the level of love for their albums as they did during that age. This is an angry and aggressive modern Slayer album that stands tall above their past few albums such as Christ Illusion and is a more than listenable album.\n",
        "\nFor those who heard Bloodline and were turned off by Slayer's attempt at cashing in on the nu-metal trend, consider Haunting The Chapel your introduction into true Slayer. This was the EP where they changed from being a speed based NWOBHM-influenced band into a full blown thrash metal outfit with their own completely original sound. This three song collection of masterpieces is the reason albums such as Hell Awaits and Reign In Blood came about and remains to this day Slayer's most primal release. The running time might be short but it was more than enough to influence every thrash metal outfit that came after it and showed Slayer to be among the best in the genre.\n\nPrior to Haunting The Chapel Slayer had released one studio album entitled Show No Mercy, a promising debut that was a far cry from the style of music they captured on this EP but was still more than listenable and a great album in its own right. Haunting the Chapel stepped their game up and was based around dense tremolo picking and lightning fast drumming with a very evil sound to it and Tom Araya's demonic vocals are captured in their most aggressive state. The pace of this EP is marvelous and it never lets up in its relentless assault on the ears, with never ending flurries of guitar notes and incredibly fast shredding solos that are both chaotic and awesome to listen to and this EP set Slayer apart from their competition. Whilst Metallica were messing with a more mid-pace style of thrash, Slayer's answer was to write a gung-ho EP that thunders along at the fastest speeds imaginable.\n\nChemical Warfare is the song that many check out this EP for and is rightfully considered one of the best Slayer songs and also perhaps one of the most influential thrash metal songs of all time. It is symbolic of Slayer's dual guitar sound in the way that both guitars play the exact same riff although one plays it a string down to create an evil-sounding guitar harmony that is unmatched by many bands out there. Slayer had a knack in their early days of creating songs that sounded truly horrific and evil and haunting, and Chemical Warfare was the song that started this trend. This song also has Tom Araya's most chaotic vocal performance to date, and is a far cry from the lunatic shouting found on songs such as Necrophobic off of Reign In Blood. Instead the band used a distant effect on his voice whilst he cackles and gargles his words in the most cruel sounding tones imaginable. The song also has a slightly more relaxed section close to the soloing that works perfectly with the atmosphere of the song and shows off the knack for how to structure a thrash metal song that Slayer perfected with their early works and showed off to even greater effect on their legendary track Angel Of Death.\n\nThe other songs on the Haunting the Chapel EP are neither as significant nor quite as good as Chemical Warfare is. Both are listenable thrash metal tunes but neither has the creativity in the structure nor the interesting riffs of that song but they both have some brilliant tremolo picked lines and fast, maniacal solos and carry that Slayer sound that would influence a generation. The production on this EP is not the best but it really suits the style of the EP and matches the lyrical content found on songs such as Chemical Warfare to make for one of the cruelest sounding pieces of metal in existence. Some would complain and say that the guitars and drumming are not quite crisp enough and that Tom Araya's vocals have too much of a distant sound to them and aren't mixed well enough, but in reality the production job is just fine for an EP of this caliber.\n\nHaunting The Chapel is definitely a highly recommended piece of work that is early thrash metal at its rawest and most aggressive with some of the best lyrical content out there and is a three song collection that is nothing short of a masterpiece. It has a few flaws that can not be ignored, primarily that there is not enough variety and that the songs that aren't Chemical Warfare are not quite as strong as that particular track.\n",
        "\nWhen Show No Mercy came out in 1983, I bet it scared the shit out of everyone. This is one of the most influential and remarkable albums to ever see the light of day. This may not be the first thrash metal album, for I think that would be Welcome to Hell, but I prefer this to any thrash release before or after it. This is a fucking masterpiece. Leather, bullet belts, pentagrams, upturned crosses, and fucking thrash. This album should be the one every new metalhead should start with. No bullshit, just blasphemous thrash metal. Lombardo\u2019s drumming is, along with the riffs, the album's highlight. He has control over his drumming and while it may not be as fast as his contemporaries in hardcore or punk, it sticks to his objective, which is to blend in with the music. The vocals of Araya cannot be left out. His is one of the most unique voices in metal and is perfect for Slayer. He has always been a great vocalist and is apt for Slayer, though some may disagree. His bass lines are quite hard to hear, but that doesn't hinder me because the overall output is great. \n\nNow to the focal point of his release and that\u2019s the guitar work: both the riffs and the massive solos. The riffs are really catchy for all the songs here. Seems they took a good amount of time to create the riffs and the solos. There's a lot of whammy-bar usage, which is pretty great and many bands like Possessed, for one, would make this an integral part of their sound. The solos are fast and tremolo-picked and at times melodic like the one in \u2018The Antichrist\u2019. There\u2019s always been a comparison between Kill \u2018Em All and Show No Mercy, as both are killer releases, but both of them are quite different from each other. Kill \u2018Em All is speed metal pretty much while Show No Mercy is pure thrash. \n\nWith anti-Christian lyrical themes and imagery, one hell of an album cover, and one of the most recognizable logos in metal, Show No Mercy was destined for greatness. The production is ideal in its overall sound, but the bass is nonexistent here. I don\u2019t think the inaudibility of the bass is a huge let off, but I think this would\u2019ve been better if the bass were audible. I think this release was immense and catapulted Slayer to the forefront of the US thrash metal scene, which was bearing seeds for the birth of monumental thrash metal releases in the future. I\u2019m not sure if this is my favorite Slayer release or if it\u2019s Reign in Blood, but I guess Show No Mercy edges out Reign in Blood considering the time of its release and its classy musicianship at such a young stage in the band\u2019s career. \n\nAll of the songs here are great and it\u2019s really hard for me to pick one or two as my favorite tracks. This release has spawned a huge number of clones, but nothing in the highest sense of the word comes close to this monumental release. Show No Mercy is one of my favorite albums and one of the greatest thrash albums ever. If you call yourself a \u2018thrash-head\u2019 and you haven\u2019t listened to this album (I wonder if there are such people), you should kill yourself because your life isn\u2019t valuable. Die by the Sword!\n",
        "\nAlthough later releases from the big four of thrash (Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer and Megadeth) sounded wildly different, it is extraordinary how similar the debut records by of all of them are. As The Antichrist kicks off, it could clearly be any early James Hatfield riff. Dave Mustaine and Scott Ian too penned many similar guitar lines as you will find throughout Show No Mercy, so when it comes down to judging which debut was better, the only way to do so is on the strength of the songs. I would say all bands' musical abilities were equal, although Anthrax\u2019s 1984 effort automatically loses out by having Neil Turbin on vocals. The man was clearly not up for the job compared to both his successors. Megadeth\u2019s Killing is my Business\u2026 was a thrilling effort, but compared to both Slayer and Metallica\u2019s debuts it felt as if Mustaine was throwing too many ideas at the wall and seeing what stuck. From my chart run down, you can see I much prefer the Metallica debut, but Show No Mercy is not too far off at all (it would take until the mid 90\u2019s for Metallica to fall behind Slayer in my humble, yet oh so correct opinion).\n\nSlayer, who are best known today for their extreme speeds, only get hellbent on The Final Command, which ends up being the weakest link on here, maybe because production techniques hadn\u2019t yet caught up with the genre, although knowing that Kerry King\u2019s dad and Tom Araya financed the recording, plus the fact the group ended up paying for their own tour tells us that there was not a lot of money flying around at the time. Metal Blade must have corrected and compensated the situation some how as they managed to keep the band on the label for another two years after this came out. Knowing how huge they are now, the mind boggles to how.\n\nThe band is so young here their influences are threaded throughout each groove. Crionics could easily be confused as an outtake from Iron Maiden\u2019s Killers lp, from the crafting of the lead from Kerry King to the rolling thunder of the bass line which is pure Steve Harris through and through. Elsewhere you can finds tips of the hat to the satanic imagery of Mercyful Fate and Venom with bonus props especially going to the song craft of Judas Priest. If it weren\u2019t for this, Show No Mercy would be just another metal record thrown upon heavy metals trash heap, all style and no substance, but songs like Die By The Sword and Tormentor stick in your head long after any track on a 1983 speed metal record should. The chorus\u2019 are strong enough to hold the bolts of the song together when the speed gets too frantic. It wasn\u2019t until Reign In Blood, produced by Rick Rubin, that Slayer found the production that truly matched their pace.\n\nA few years ago I read an interview with Dave Lombardo whom I may add is often referred to today as thrash metal\u2019s greatest drummer, that he only realized he was a good enough drummer for a career in music when he managed to play the whole of Kiss\u2019 100,000 Years, including the six minute solo off of their Alive album. Not knowing this tidbit at the time, but being a Slayer concert virgin I attended one of their London shows in the early '90s wearing a Kiss t-shirt and the looks I got from the throng of denim and leather-clad muppets were that of disgust and ridicule. I felt like a right chump for days after, my metal credibility all but disappeared, my rock buddies mocked and I still hold the mental scars of course, but after reading Dave\u2019s comments ten years after the fact I finally felt vindicated. Still, I wouldn\u2019t do it again. Ever. Slayer fans take no prisoners.\n",
        "\nAs much as I enjoy some of Slayer\u2019s later work, and even though I do enjoy the more chaotic thrash now and then, I\u2019ve always preferred the more traditional approach to thrash metal. I like Kreator, but I\u2019m more of an Overkill fan. So I guess that\u2019s a good basis for why I love this album so much. But it goes much deeper than that.\n\nEvery aspect of this album seems perfectly presented. Its low quality fits the mood of the music well. I\u2019ve never considered Tom Araya a great vocalist, but one thing he does perfectly is fit Slayer\u2019s sound. He\u2019d be a shitty singer in any other band, but is perfect for Slayer. However, one thing that is strange is how often he uses his high pitched vocals here. It\u2019s pretty common. Even though he used them after this album, it became far scarcer. Which kind of sucks, because Tom\u2019s High pitch scream was fucking nuts. In fact, \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d open with a sick scream after a guitar intro, much like \u201cAngel of Death\u201d would later. The song then goes on to be a fucking fantastic, bone crushing thrash track.\n\nThe guitar much different than on most Slayer albums, having a more riff oriented than the speed based style that dominated most later Slayer albums. There are more ringing power chords, and the riffs feel more like Metallica\u2019s \u201cKill \u2018Em All\u201d than \u201cReign in Blood,\u201d but it took what Metallica was starting, and truly brought it to a new level. It takes that sort of \u2018NWOBHM-inspired thrash\u2019 sound and really makes it a little more powerful.\n\nThe solos also sound much more written than the \u201cfranticly fretting random notes on the high E string\u201d sound they\u2019d later adopt. Some of the solos are actually pretty fantastic. Because god, do I hate most Slayer solos. \n\nThe only downside is that much of the album sounds the same. Every song is good, and the album is very consistent, but sometimes it makes you want them to try different things. Which, to be fair, does happen now and then, but no enough to make it feel like they could do more. In most cases \u201cdifferent things\u201d means letting a lot more NWBHM influence seep through, with \u201cCrionics,\u201d almost sounding like an early Iron Maiden tune. By the way, \u201cCrionics\u201d is a fucking fantastic track. It goes more in that midpaced but heavy track direction. Maybe like \u2018Seek and Destroy\u2019 with a Maiden gallop? There\u2019s a bridge part that actually almost reminds me of early Manowar too. It\u2019s such a strange song to hear from Slayer.\n\nThe title track is fucking intense, very fast by the standards at the time. The only faster song on the album is the Final Command, which is actually something of an indicator of the direction Slayer would later choose to take.\n\nI honestly wish Slayer had done more music in this style. Again, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like later slayer albums. Aside from the vastly overrated Reign in Blood, I\u2019m a fan of everything up until \u201cDevine Intervention,\u201d which if both just OK, and their last decent album. But this style is so much more interesting to me. Or maybe I only like it so much because it\u2019s the only album Slayer did in this style. Or maybe because it came so early in the thrash scene, this being up there with \u201cKill \u2018em All\u201d as the earliest all out thrash albums. Either way, despite being looked over in favor of \u201cReign in Blood\u201d and \u201cHell Awaits,\u201d this album is truly a classic. In my opinion, this is the best goddamn Slayer album. \n\nFucking. Slayer.\n",
        "\nFor a debut, this thrash metal quartet is amongst the ranks of fellow competitors such as Metallica\u2019s Kill \u2018em All. Show No Mercy from start to finish is an epic saga of pure metal originality and brilliance. The production quality is quite raw sounding, but each segment from band be it the vocals, guitars or drums are well mixed in here. Tom Araya sets the stage for some highly evil screaming soaking up the music very well in its\u2019 entirety. Songs such as \u201cDie By the Sword\u201d and \u201cBlack Magic\u201d are classics and my favorite tracks by far. That\u2019s obligatory though, what matters here is the music.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll hear in the songwriting are bar chords galore with riffs that are captivating. Not only that, but they also feature tremolo picked frenzies on some tracks. Both guitarists put out some amazing leads. It\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between the 2 guitarists. Over time, there was a progression by Jeff Hanneman and a laziness in Kerry King\u2019s lead guitar work. On this debut, both guitarists put out some great tracks and the crunch tone distortion reigns here. I still think that Reign In Blood is the band\u2019s best output, but Show No Mercy is one hell of a good debut.\n\nThere are trade off leads here most of what you find in the music is purely original thrash metal to the core. Every instrument is in unison with one another. Again the raw production is typical when it comes to the early 80\u2019s style of recording. The mixing and production forced the band to have talent. That is apparent here. The leads are simply amazing and awe inspiring. I don\u2019t think that any of them could compete with their later releases. These leads on here are the most original. The riffs are simply amazing as well and the band put together a conglomeration of thrash metal genius.\n\nThe only beef that I have about the album are the lyrical concepts. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of thought to write about Satanism/anti-Christianity. But this is why Slayer stayed underground over the years is because of them being notorious for construction these topics. But they admitted they were not serious about the topics or Satanists themselves. But I still do thing that it\u2019s obvious that they have a beef with religion in general a lot like Destruction has as well. Metallica had some tracks on their early 80\u2019s albums that talked about these topics but weren\u2019t serious about it. They just wanted to stay underground.\n\nNo song on here is boring or lacking in intensity. Araya\u2019s screaming goes well with the music even though I\u2019m not a huge fan of his vocal work. But on Show No Mercy, his vocals well suited the music in its entirety. The most amazing and original amounts of work went into constructing the music. Both Jeff and Kerry were at their best on here especially in the lead department. They both are in unison when it comes to dual match up. Kerry definitely declined over the years where Jeff kept getting better and better then it became easier to distinguish between which lead was whose. On Show No Mercy, both of them were amazing.\n\nIf you don\u2019t own this release and are a thrash metal fan, get it right away. You\u2019d be amazed at most of the sounds coming out of your speakers. 10 tracks and a little over 35 minutes in length, Show No Mercy is a debut album that deserves mighty recognition for. Too bad about their latest release, stick with the old Slayer and you\u2019ll be fine. This debut into the thrash metal world created such amazing work by the band and their talent during the earliest era. Most thrash metal bands either changed their style of music like Metallica and some others keep putting out releases that sound the same. Slayer\u2019s new release is putrid. Show No Mercy is one hell of a great release however!\n",
        "\nTotally overrated album and I\u2019ve always felt this way about this release. The intro is eerie though and I wish that I could say that the guitar riffs and solos were worthy of praise. I\u2019m just not hearing it on here. I don\u2019t see the major gaga about this album. Araya\u2019s vocals are less intense than on Show No Mercy, but they do fit the music well. I just think that the guitars could\u2019ve been better constructed here, but this isn\u2019t the case in my opinion. All I hear is monotonous tremolo picked riffs with mediocre solos and production quality that just does not sum it up to being a classic from Slayer.\n\nI\u2019m not one to read the reviews here, just the percentages. It\u2019s just not there for me no matter how much I listen to the album. Guitars could\u2019ve been way better than they are. I\u2019d rather listen to Show No Mercy than this one. It\u2019s a hard one to see that much significance in the recording. To me, this is average Slayer work. However, the riffs are original sounding, but nothing that really sticks in my brain into thinking that it\u2019s better than it really is. Why people esteem this album better than Show No Mercy is ridiculous. The vocals are just bland here and don\u2019t fit as well as on their debut.\n\nThe leads were just mediocre by both guitarists. You can\u2019t hear the difference better Jeff and Kerry in that department which is good. I\u2019m just not hearing riffs that are significant. I mean there are fast picking guitar riffs with chords decently constructed, just nothing worthy of praising the album. The production sound is kind of flat sounding, but you can hear everything in unison. Just a mediocre output by the band and to me it could\u2019ve been a much better release in my opinion. Their debut and succeeding albums are both way up at the top. But Hell Awaits never did appeal to me.\n\nTheir debut had a raw production whereas this one again is flat sounding making the instruments sound less brutal and intense than on their debut. Everything about this album doesn\u2019t appeal to me. The riffs could\u2019ve been way better, the vocals with more screaming, the drums were powerful though and that is the gist of it. Of course I like old Slayer and maybe over time my opinion of Hell Awaits changes. I doubt it though. Show No Mercy really appealed to me.\n\nIf you want quality Slayer and would like to listen to thrash metal that\u2019s totally original sounding and worthy of praise, get Show No Mercy. The riffs are high quality on that album. On Hell Awaits, the music didn\u2019t interest me. Again, a highly overrated album that to me is just average thrash metal. They really went ballistic on their succeeding album entitled Reign In Blood. Get that one if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s much better than Hell Awaits. Nothing good to say about this one I think it\u2019s a total waste of a release. People have told me differently but I\u2019m not convinced. Hold off on buying this, listen to some tracks on YouTube first before you choose to buy Hell Awaits.\n",
        "\nEver since their inception in the early 80's, Slayer have become a household name amongst the metal community. Records such as Reign In Blood and Seasons in the Abyss are widely considered to be amongst some of the best thrash metal albums of all time. Fast forward to 2010, and this band is still going strong, but do they still kick as much ass as they did with their early albums? This is something metal fans debate on a regular basis, but in my honest opinion, no. This band, ever since the 2000s has become incredibly stale for me, and World Painted Blood is absolutely no exception. But hey, if you like repetitive 4/4 16th note thrash riff patterns, you'll eat this up.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the production. When I first heard tracks from this album I thought this had sounded like a Slayer version of Metallica's Death Magnetic, which is not a good thing in my book. Apparently Rick Rubin, who is known for producing most Slayer albums, and who had produced Death Magnetic the previous year, must've thought his production on that record sounded so good he wanted to replicate it on the next Slayer album. Well, I suppose that could explain why World Painted Blood sounds the way it does. The guitars and drums sound incredibly dry and over-compressed here, and half the time you can barely hear any bass. This creates a really bad overall sound to the album, and just makes it feel empty and lacking the punch that good thrash metal albums have.\n\nLet's talk about the songs, shall we? The title track begins with an interesting sample of foreign chant-like voices, and then a half-decent melodic guitar harmony comes in for a few measures before breaking into one of the least creative thrash metal riffs I have honestly ever heard. It's the same stereotypical simple tremolo picked pattern which we've heard in the last 100 or so Slayer songs. The song continues throughout with more of these predictable and uncreative riffs, along with Tom's worn out voice yelling about death and plague (oh gee, I didn't see that coming). Speaking of which, Tom's vocals sound way too monotonous throughout this album, his tone of voice almost NEVER changes! Even those Half the tracks on this album recycle the same formula one after another, and there is almost no diversity to be found here. Songs such as Beauty Through Order, Human Strain and Playing With Dolls start with slower tempos but eventually build into more of the same generic crap over and over again. Oh and guitar solos? If you know Slayer's back catalog, you won't find anything in the solo department you haven't already heard. Just more random wankery with no real thought put into them that we already know. Drums, again, nothing special. Same stuff you've heard in just about every thrash metal album. Nothing creative here. Honestly I think the lyrics are just a tad more interesting than the past couple Slayer albums, which is really the best thing I can say about it... but even that's not saying much, as there's still nothing mind blowing here in terms of lyric writing.\n\nOverall, this album feels like a very one-dimensional, lazy compilation of riffs rushed together, only made worse by its irritating, Death Magnetic-like production. It's not completely unlistenable, nor is it absolutely terrible, it's just not special in any way, and gives me no reason to ever care to return to it.\n",
        "\nThe ultimate live album in the early history of the \"Big 4\" in american thrash. Yeah, when we think deeply about it, there are few contestants against this one. Megadeth, perhaps, made a couple of nice live albums as well. Yeah, and Metallica, yeah, why not. And Anthrax? Ehm, nope. Only Megadeth lies near in what's about live performances.\n\nAnyway. The thumping bumping here is a blast. You know, Lombardo rules it, no matter how hard you can try, he rules it. The strongest force in here relies on Dave's insaniac patching. And that's it, you know. Even if here we get one of the most astonishing performances by Araya in the vocals, so fresh, vivid and deadly, heavy lies the crown, but rests on Lombardo, easily. Mr. King might be a king, but the king is Dave, you know. Hanneman does it pretty well, but Lombardo is the fucking antichrist!\n\nBeing that said, and leaving away the funny paragraphs, the whole band works tight and oiled. There is no weakness in here. Just pure, plain and simple thrash deadly metal. As I stated before, Tom Araya licks out one of his finest vocals ever. Listen to the opener \"Hell Awaits\" or the closer \"Chemical Warfare\" and you will get a glimpse of it. Obviously, the bass lines are not the best thing he does, figure out dude that he sings like a devil while he plays and that's not an easy stuff to do. But somehow, the bass sounds pretty remarkable in this album, so no complaints about that.\n\nFor me, the only mistake in the recording is the faded and distant sound of the guitars here. Mr. King deserves more amplifiers and Hanneman's back ups too. But we want more, this is almost-death metal, the roar must be hellibilly destructive. In my opinion, the stuff wasn't about the live performance itself, but the production and mixing of the album. I think they lowered the sound of the guitars on purpose. I don't know why, or is it just an illusion in my head, but to me seems to be like that.\n\nSo, anyway, I want this to be a short review so I'll finish it here: this is a very good live album, the best ever made in early thrash period. Araya is better than ever, Lombardo thrash thrash thrash thrash fucking thrashes and rules, King and Hanneman, while they sound a bit faded, perhaps because of the final mix of the album, do it pretty well and the thing is totally aggressive, deadly, evil, punching and insane. If you ever wanted to buy a live album by the \"Big 4\" of bay area thrash and you never knew where to start, here you go, \"Decade of Aggression\" is the safest play.\n\nHighlights: Hell Awaits. Die by Sword. South of Heaven. Dead Skin Mask. Angel of Death. Black Magic. Expendable Youth. Chemical Warfare.\n\nA slight mistake: The production, in my humble opinion. They could have done it better, specially in the mix of the guitars.\n",
        "\n\"Seasons In The Abyss\" is an interesting album. It's often considered to be the last really decent Slayer record, yet it's also the one that divides the fandom in two, some considering it a classic, while others deride it as a lame, poorly-produced effort. I'm in the middle ground, as my dumb ass usually is. While it is certainly a big step down from \"South of Heaven\", it's not awful, but really not too great either.\n\nThe band is really just okay on this one. Araya's bass is now pretty much nonexistent, and he still won't scream; he mostly just depends on that yelling and shouting, not to mention a fair amount of clean growling going on too. Hanneman and King's guitar work is still really good; lots of riffs to go around, but here they sound like they're going through the motions a bit. Lombardo is still probably the only full-on ass-kicker here, again turning that kit into mush from his aggressive hammering and relentless cymbal-slaughtering. \n\nThe production is unusual, sounding loud, raw and often sounding a bit too clean, though I do dig the guitar tone. I guess they were going for a more modern production, which would explain the somewhat proto-groove tendencies of some of the songs. Take for example the lame and overrated \"Dead Skin Mask\", which would be total shit if it weren't for the guitar tone. But man does it sound like a Slipknot song at times, with those whispered vocals sometimes popping up, not to mention the limp dick solo and repetitive riffage. Other songs aren't as as bad, like \"Blood Red\" or \"Born of Fire\", but man oh man are they uninspired; very, very fillerish. \nAt least the better songs outweigh the weaker. \"Skeletons of Society\", while itself also being fairly groovish in nature, is at least much catchier than \"Dead Skin Mask\" and has a stronger solo. Speedier numbers like \"Hallowed Point\" with its killer solos or the particularly catchy \"Spirit In Black\" are quite good as well. Then the opener \"War Ensemble\". Oh boy, definitely a Slayer classic. Not \"South of Heaven\" or \"Hell Awaits\" great but still a very solid and awesomely aggressive number, complete with the immortal line \"The final swing is not a drill, IT'S HOW MANY PEOPLE I CAN KILL!!!\" Lastly, the epic title track and closer. Not my personal favorite, I do like it a lot less than most fans, but still the song has great mood, buildup and riffage.\n\nOverall, \"Seasons In The Abyss\" is a mixed bag. Not a bad bag, but not top of the shelf either. Some of the songs kick a great amount of ass or are just lame or forgettable. I don't know what else to say except that while the album is worthwhile, don't expect \"Hell Awaits\" or \"South of Heaven\" here. Do try to appreciate as the last solid Slayer album, before the boys slipped down that hill into an abyss of mediocrity and total shit from which they have yet to escape...\n",
        "\nAfter the overrated mess that was \"Reign In Blood\", Slayer got back on track. 1988's \"South of Heaven\" was what should of happened right after \"Hell Awaits\". Slayer has progressed further on this record, maturing their lyrics and song structure albeit in a nice, condensed format with that technical flair a number of thrash bands like Heathen, Metallica and Testament were doing in the late 80's. Though the speed of the last album is toned down somewhat, the heaviness is still there and then some, giving way to what I think is Slayer's best album.\n\nIf you wanna know the truth, I used to hate this album. But, that was mostly because of the production. I had MP3s of the original recording, which sounded awful, like the songs were quietly recorded in a tin can. The easy to find remaster is makes a huge difference; a bit loud, but far superior. Slayer themselves are back on top here, save maybe for Tom Araya. His bass may not be invisible like it was on \"Reign in Blood\", but it's still pretty buried. His vocals too are a slight step down here. \"Reign\" was also probably the last album with true Araya shrieks, as starting here and practically on every other subsequent Slayer record, he uses a somewhat strained yell and half-assed growling and shouting. King and Hanneman are still going strong as ever though. On here they let loose with an array of chillingly intricate solos and a load of really memorable riffs. Thanks to them, this is probably Slayer's most riff-laden album. And lastly, Dave Lombardo still makes his poor drum set look like a fresh prison bitch. He too jumps on the technical train, hammering out loads more double bass, lots of little solos and fills.\n\nAs I said before, the speed of \"Reign In Blood\" is (somewhat) played down in favor of a greater focus on big riffs, solos and more concise, condensed song structure with a still very heavy nature. Hell, not even a single song on here hits the 5 minute mark, but at least they're not spastic half song like on \"Reign\". Sorry, I just can't get over that.\nWell, superficially, just about every song kicks ass on here in one way or another. The title track opens a moody riff that almost sounds like the beginning of a bad dream, and then it just keeps building and building in aggression and speed until the song explodes into a piercing single-note outro. \"On and on, south of heaven!\" The cool \"Silent Scream\" is a bit generic, but it's still has pretty catchy riffage, a nice break and it's one of the speedier numbers on here. We also have what I believe are the album masterpieces: Behind The Fucking Crooked Cross and Mandatory Fucking Suicide! \"Behind\" has a totally unforgettable main riff, the drumming is totally relentless and the King-Hanneman solo will fucking RIP YOU APART! \"Mandatory Suicide\" is a tense mid-paced crusher with moody near-chanted vocals and more ripping intricate riffage. After song 5 the album takes a slight nosedive in quality but never once sucks ass.\nWell, maybe except for one thing: the cover of Judas Priest's \"Dissident Aggressor\". No...just...just no. You never, EVER cover Judas Priest. I don't care if you're Slayer, Helloween, Testament, or Death, you CAN'T beat the original! Araya can't even begin to hit those highs, the guitars sound lazier with less punch...whatever. Why did they even bother?\n\nOverall, while Tom Araya's musical skills have taken something of a nosedive and the \"Dissident Aggressor\" cover is totally useless, that's not nearly enough for me to not realize that this is a thrash masterpiece. The songs are kick ass and quite well-composed and written, particularly the first half of the album, and the other members of Slayer are still heading on strong. While this isn't my favorite Slayer album (that oh so prestigious honor belongs to \"Show No Mercy\"), I will readily state that it is easily their best.\n",
        "\nMy first Slayer review on this site was of \"Show No Mercy\", which still currently reigns as my favorite album of theirs. In that review I mentioned that I wasn't exactly the biggest Slayer fan in the world. Well, after a few months of actually listening to what they boys offer, I've grown far more admiring of their work...for the most part. My original opinion of Slayer was based solely of this legendary affair. I used to think of it as a loud, incoherent mess of an album. And for the most part I still do, only now I like it even less because after the greatness and progression of Slayer's last two albums and one EP, this one stands as a spastic, sloppy little earsore. \"Reign In Blood\", while definitely bringing home the bacon in terms of genre-bending brutality and musical performance, is a choppy, too-short misstep in the band's 80's discography. \n\nAs I just said, the band is on fire here, which is partly why I gave the album something higher than 60-69%. Tom Araya really lets it go with his patented yells and and gravelly shouting, not to mention some of the finest screams in the group's history. His bass, however, is another story. This is probably the first of many, many Slayer albums where the bass is practically nonexistent, and it does hurt the layers of the sound a bit. King and Hanneman very viciously tearing out riffs up and down their axes, making their efforts on \"Hell Awaits\" ALMOST tame in comparison. Admittedly they rely on tremolo picking a bit much, but hey, they still fucking kick! The highlight of the four of them is easily Dave Lombardo. This is probably the guy's best career performance. He is absolutely relentless on pounding those skins, never once letting up with double bass and leaving nary a quiet moment alone with a solid fill. \n\nEven though the guys are great at what they do, it's how they do it that's a different matter. \"Reign in Blood\" may have pushed the envelope in total brutality and helped birth death metal, but that doesn't stop it from being a choppy experiment with half-songs, mumbled riffs, repetitive lyrics and a miserably short running time. There's only about 2 songs total on here that aren't a waste of space. First off, of course, \"Angel of Death\". One of the best Slayer songs ever; totally and completely ferocious riffing, probably the only good solo on the album, brutal lyrics and one of my all-time favorite heavy metal screams opening up the song. The first half of my second pick is \"Piece By Piece\", a first half because \"Piece By Piece\" is still basically a half song. It does have more structure than most other numbers on here, and you can actually make out what the hell Araya is shouting about. The second half of my second pick id the legendary title track; I call this one a half song in of itself because like 30-40 seconds of this thing is made up of damn sound effects! Regardless, the song itself is great; lots of wicked mosh riffing and one of the best breakdowns of all time at 2:11. \nThe rest of this album of half songs need not apply. Some are okay, like the more mid-paced moments of \"Jesus Saves\" or the solid soloing of \"Criminally Insane\", but the rest of these tracks just come and go really in a chaotic, messy rush of jumbled vocals and riffs buried under relentless adrenaline. \n\nOverall, this album is a big step down from the group's last 3 main efforts. While I do appreciate their performances and the fact that the viciousness helped give birth to death metal, it's that viciousness that kills the record. Only about (I guess technically) song great songs, while otherwise riffs and variety get thrown out the window in favor of aimless numbskull brutality. It's too bad, I would have love to have seen what Slayer could have evolved into RIGHT after \"Hell Awaits\".\n",
        "\nThe mighty Slayer was climbing to the top in the mid-80's. \"Show No Mercy\" showed an aggressive young band hungry to wreck the lives all who stood before them, while the wicked follow-up EP \"Haunting The Chapel\" showed the bad taking themselves to a sound which would eventually become thrash as we know it. Full album number two, \"Hell Awaits\", brought to life something unreal. Something only thought that could exist in one's most unholy nightmare. \"Hell Awaits\" scared people. It made \"Kill 'Em All\" look as mellow as a Pink Floyd album, and \"Welcome To Hell\" about as blasphemous as a Sunday picnic. It surely was at the time the heaviest and most unrelenting album ever, and even today it still stands as a major achievement in Slayer's discography for turning thrash metal into how we know it now.\n\nThe classic lineup got better and better with each album, and on here I believe they reached their nirvana; this along with the mid-paced mayhem of \"South of Heaven\" shows Slayer at their most talented. Not to mention the music has gotten even better, maturing and moving into a distinctly though not overtly progressive direction. Tom Araya's bass is probably loudest on this album than any other, and he strums that rhythm quite well; his voice is practically perfect, his array of fearsome shouting and demonic banshee shrieks are legitimately terrifying. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman make a force to be reckoned with. It seems they sold their own souls to gain even wilder guitar abilities, because that's only way I describe the hellish shredding and trade-offs these guys unleash here. And how about Dave fucking Lombardo huh? His double bass pummeling is now totally lacking in sloppiness, not mention he puts on some killer fills as well as some mighty kick drumming. ALL HAIL!\n\nThere's all but seven songs on \"Hell Awaits\", but that was just enough to change the course of thrash metal as we know it apparently. The title track slithers in with an evil backwards message and then... \"Welcome Back!\". Araya yells o'er relentless Lombardo double bass while King and Hanneman duke it out with some shredding during the immense solo. And let's not forget that gang growl: \"HELL AWAITS!\" HA-HA! The follow-up is one of my favorites, the bloodthirsty \"Kill Again\" with its merciless main breakdown, a surprisingly catchy chorus with that buzzsaw guitar under the chorus itself,and to top it off, one of the Araya's most startlingly evil shrieks ever at the song's end. Another big highlight is the epic \"Crypts of Eternity\", a bass-heavy, weirdly melodic two-fisted thrasher with some more truly evil Araya screams around the five minute point. Then we have the ugly speeder \"Necrophiliac\", complete with relentless drumming unstoppable Hanneman/King riffage, including a nifty little break and some interesting time changes. \n\nOverall, evil perfection. Araya, Hanneman, King, and Lombardo are at the top of their game, creatively and musically. All seven songs are merciless works of art that totally re-shaped the heavy metal landscape, and I for one am glad that hell took over in this case.\n",
        "\nIf there's one thing I hate in thrash metal, it's laziness. It can really lead to some dangerous misconceptions depending on one being affected by or immune to such a horrible condition. Today's thrash metal (if one can still call it that) is really fucking lazy. I blame it in equal parts on the bands and on their audiences because, let's face it, nowadays a band will most likely play what they think we want to hear, not what they want to play. That's why the standards have fallen, and that's why, unfortunately, we won't get another \"Reign In Blood\" again, not from Slayer nor from any other band.\n\nThere's a conspicuous amount of bashing of Reign In Blood going on throughout the net, mostly based on the supposed \"lack of good songwriting\" going on here. While everyone seems to agree that \"Angel Of Death\", \"Postmortem\" and \"Raining Blood\" are masterpieces (which they are), the common perception is that almost everything in between is not even worth a listen. Reading such nonsense makes my insides hurt as it proves how lazy metalheads have become.\n\n\"Reign In Blood\" came out after the promising (if flawed) \"Hell Awaits\", which suffered very much from a weak production and an especially bad mixing job by Metal Blade boss Brian Slagel, and this is solely responsible for the album's status as a \"contender\" and not a full-on masterpiece. The two albums share most of the lyrical themes, the buzzsaw riffing, and the concept of \"evil\" that, at the time, Slayer were so deeply in love with. What sets \"Reign In Blood\" apart is an urgency and hunger that its predecessor only hinted at, like the guys in the band were possessed by a malevolent higher power they had no control over. This results in the most credible of Slayer's performances ever committed to tape. \n\nAs far as the songs are structured, every track on the record is your typical rock song. You get an opening riff, two verse/chorus repetitions, a middle section/bridge, solo, and a closing verse/chorus-outro. That's exactly how the three songs globally hailed as masterpieces are also structured. The difference lays in the amount of time the listener is being left to understand what hit him, and in the case of the 7 tracks that the core of this album consists of, there just isn't enough time for the average metal fan's dozy ear to realize what's been happening in those 16+ minutes. I have my own opinion about what goes on on this album: Hell. Hell in music form, conjured up by four certifiable individuals who just didn't give a good goddamn about what genre they fit or what other people might think of their music. They just wanted to blast, and they did so in the most awesome way possible, and that's by literally blowing away the boundaries of the genre they invented and carving their name in stone for eternity with the most violent and vibrant thrash metal album ever made. Sure, there's heavier thrash records out there, but more intense? No. Fucking. Way.\n\nThe terrifying cover is an appropriate introduction to the music behind it and can be summarized in two words: TOTAL-CHAOS. The thrashing fury of every single track on this record is unmatched today. The opening riff to \"Angel Of Death\" is the musical equivalent of a kick in the teeth by a 300-lb Maori wearing army boots. And you know what the best part is? That kick lasts 28 minutes. A half hour of ultra-intense emotions, from the ultra-violent \"Piece By Piece\" through the demonic triptych \"Necrophobic/Altar Of Sacrifice/Jesus Saves\" (the fastest and more relentless portion of the album, that's where the most heads will fall off) to the bewildering madness of \"Criminally Insane\", \"Reborn\" and especially \"Epidemic\" (an overlooked gem). It all leads to the \"Postmortem/Raining Blood\" double attack, the crushing, devastating, and inevitable conclusion. \n\nThe intensity never falls under danger-level. The band members all play at 300 mph, creating an infernal vortex that, combined with the over-the-top sound of the recording and the incessant, brutal screaming of Tom Araya, makes this wild Satanic ride of an album a physical and psychological experience rather than a mere listen. 26 years on, Reign In Blood still sounds like it wants to rip through the speakers and smash your face, and we're talking about an album that was recorded just the way we hear it, without digital fixing. Especially Dave Lombardo's performance deserves praise as many of the faster and more technical metal drummers out there today mention him as one of their biggest influences, sometimes solely based on this performance.\n\nFinally, I doubt there's much thinking from the band behind the making of this masterpiece, and that's the beauty of it. The music engraved on this record comes straight from Slayer's gut; there are no filters at play here, no manipulation, just the real shit. It's too damn fast to leave any time for thinking. It's a wild ride and should be enjoyed for what it is, so just put the record on, wear your headphones, turn off the lights, and lock your room's door. Now listen to \"Reign In Blood\" the way you're supposed to and let it take you to that stinking ugly place.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard this album, my first impression from the recording quality was the absolute pits. But then something happened that doesn't really do: it grew on me and I understood with Rick Rubin as the producer, he achieved that \"raw\" sound in the lurk vibe, which made the guitars, vocals and drums more life-like. Like the music flowed well with that audio, that production quality. Again, it took time before I realized that this is what made Slayer dominate during the 80-90's was their old school type of recordings.\n\nThere is no into to this one just fast guitar riffing right from the beginning. Of course there's so much variety in the tempos here, the guitar riffs are thick, heavily distorted, with leads that are wickedly fast. Every song you don't know what to expect speed-wise. It goes from fast to moderate to slow. All of the tempos vary depending on which song you choose to pick out. This album is entirely original from every aspect.\n\nMusically the riffs are really catchy and well thought out. An experience here is a good one if your genre is thrash metal. Riff-wise Jeff and Kerry put together some bar chords that are thick sounding, fast tremolo picked outputs as well, and moderate to mild and I mean mild like on \"Dead Skin Mask\". That song is a great example of exploring the life of a murderer Ed Gein. A child's voice is featured on that one towards the end of the song. Really eerie.\n\nThe lead department on here is still good. Hard to hear the difference between which guitar player is which, either Jeff or Kerry. You'd have to look on the insert to finalize who plays which solo. The riffs here are incredible. Fast, furious, ferocious, aggressive, unrelenting, then for varieties purposes, a song about a serial killer like I mentioned. Pure ingenuity on here. Amazing riffs that astonish the listener. The riffs go well with the lyrics too!\n\nThere is less focus on Satanism and anti-Christianity lyric-wise on this album. The lyrics talk about more about war that anything else. It seems like they put in an extra effort than just mindless evil, brutal words. More of dealing with like I said war and somewhat to dealing with politics plus anti-Christianity, though not that much. War is what comes out of this abomination than anything else. Very aggressive album.\n\nIf you don't own this Slayer album, do yourself a favor: pick it up as soon as possible! Talk about aggression here, hate, and just an overall chilling experience to listen to. Not knowing what to expect here is key, but once you've heard the album a couple or more times, the more it will make sense to you. Slayer totally captivates thrash metal and plays it with vigor. All of the guitars, vocals and drums are an especially violent revolution. Own it now!\n",
        "\nGentleman, we can modify it. We have the technology. Faster, meaner, more riffs than ever before. Complete and pure thrash metal! After their wicked NWOBHM-inspired debut album \"Show No Mercy\", Slayer really kicked it into high gear with this bloodcurdling EP. \"Haunting The Chapel\" is a 3-song masterpiece that truly bent thrash metal into what we know it has today; it's THAT important. \"Haunting The Chapel\" is oft overlooked by a number of fans for merley being a 3-song EP, but that would be a major mistake. Anyone looking for how true thrash really got going should look here.\n\nThe band's abilities really amped up after their already pretty solid performances on the debut. Tom Araya sounds really, really mean here, shouting, spitting and growling his way through lyrics of hell, war and evil. His bass is probably good, but as is often the deal with Slayer, the bass likes to take a fucking vacation while everyone else works their asses off. Like Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman for example. Their guitars rule, soloing and slicing up a storm of riffs, though often at times it basically works as this: \"Let's wank the rhythm guitar for a while, then let the lead squeal for 40 seconds.\" At the least the guitars sound truly wicked, the lead a bigger, more deranged take on the lead from the last album, while the rhythm sounds like a fucking weed-wacker possessed by a deadite. Then we gave the all-consuming drumming of Dave Lombardo. Frankly though, I liked his work better on \"Show No Mercy\", even if his work on both were pretty similar. Much like King and Hanneman he'd improve nicely on the next album.\n\nLet's get the weaker songs out of the way first. Well, most versions of \"Haunting The Chapel\" you'll get anymore will come with the bonus track \"Aggressive Perfector\", originally from the \"Metal Massacre 3\" compilation. It's an okay song, not terrible but nothing special. It's basically your typical speed metal number with a few cool riffs and some nice Araya shrieking. The title track is also just okay, though the intro riffage is really great and the lead in the solo is pretty great too. But the other two songs...oh fuck me sideways this is BRUTAL! \"Chemical Warfare\" has my vote as Slayer's best song. That's right, forget your \"Angel of Death\", your \"War Ensemble\", your \"Hell Awaits\"; it's all about \"Multi-death from chemicals!\" The intricate, massive solo is evil perfection, Araya's vocals melt faces and the amount of riffs is just crushing. Listen or DIE!!! Then we have the half as long \"Captor of Sin\". It's not as technical or intricate as \"Chemical Warfare\", but almost as awesome. This song is just pure chaos, a speedy, mean little riff-fest with killer drums and wild guitars. Behold, captor of sin!\n\nOverall, this is a damn fine little set of songs to have. Slayer has gotten stronger here, and while two songs are okay, the other two are fucking massively awesome! Don't forget \"Haunting The Chapel\"; it hasn't forgotten you, or where you live...\n",
        "\nI remember in grade school hearing some of my friends go on and on about this band called Slayer and how awesome they were and how they liked to push the envelope with songs about anti-Christianity, death, and gore. Not being a fan of metal yet, I never gave them a listen. But as I became more introduced to metal, I did research on the band and learned of their importance as one of the cornerstones of thrash metal and that their album Reign in Blood was one of the best metal albums of all time with the classic song Raining Blood. I eventually decided to give Raining Blood and the rest of the album a listen and find out what all the fuss was about. I certainly had something to fuss about, but not that it was one of the greatest metal albums of all time, but why everyone thought it was.\n\nThe problem this album comes down to overall song structure. They are all incredibly short, with Raining Blood clocking in at only four minutes and seventeen seconds, with a good minute of it consisting of sound effects, and Angel of Death times in just shy of five minutes. All the others range from two to two-and-a-half minutes long. The album is only about twenty-nine minutes long total, meaning it could qualify as an EP. Short songs aren't necessarily bad, but often times they leave me wanting more. However, with the songs as crazy and chaotic as they are, often times the shorter the better. But had the songs been longer with more attention paid to melody rather primarily on sound and speed, there would be an increased possibility for catchiness and memorability. But because the songs begin and end so quickly, it is nearly impossible to remember how any of the previous songs went because they begin and end so abruptly. having what seems to eb the same chord progression played over and over again doesn't help either.\n\nSound is the biggest issue when it comes to this album. None of the guys are bad musicians: Dave Lombardo can double bass pedal the hell of out of a drum kit and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman are incredibly fast and no doubt skilled and capable of cool solos. Now being a fan of power and speed metal, I have no problem with fast music. But it's the fact they try so hard to be fast and aggressive that everything just breaks down into a chaotic mess of sound. Their skill in instrumentation shows up in flashes throughout the album, but as they seemingly have no desire to slow down and build a solid, coherent melody, everything just seems forced. The end product is an album where every track sounds almost exactly the same as the one that preceeded it. This is the most recurring issue when it comes to thrash metal. There is nothing wrong with the genre of thrash metal and I am personally a fan of Metallica and Megadeth. However, bands like Metallica and Megadeth have been known for a willingness to slow things down and put emphasis on melody and emotions other than just anger and aggression as well as on instrumentation from time to time. Not to compare and contrast Slayer from either band too much, but while other thrash bands take the time to create a defined and solid melody to base their speed on, this is something Slayer completely leaves out. Although nearly every thrash band, including Megadeth and Metallica, runs the risk of repetition, this pitfall is most notable on Reign in Blood in that such a heavy reliance on blistering fast, hardcore punk-inspired power chord riffage closes the door on variety and creativity. \n\nThe vocals are another issue to take note of. Lead singer Tom Araya does not have a bad voice carries a strong aggressive feel. After all, thrash metal is a rough, aggressive genre which often calls for angry and shouted vocals. But because the songs are so fast it sounds like Tom just tries to scream as many words as he can in a single breath, often changing tempo when he needs to just to keep up. Once again, the problem here is a complete lack of melody, relying entirely on speed and aggression. And his shouts and singing are usually so fast and aggressive it's extremely difficult to understand a single stanza or identify a rational thought, only picking up on words such as \"blood\", \"Satan\", \"hell\", or \"death.\" \n\nThe one song that really had potential but just falls short of being great is the famous Raining Blood. After an extended sound of rainfall, it breaks out into a really cool and dark riff that inspires feelings of doom and dread. But then the verses once again break down into an unorganized mixture of chaotic riffing and double bass pedalling (why this is regarded as one of the best drum songs in metal I'll never know) while only alternately returning to that awesome riff. Kerry King provides a very impressive solo that is worthy of its recognition, but before long the song ends with another extended section of storm and rainfall sounds. While the song had potential, only about a minute of Raining Blood, with its awesome opening riff and impressive solo, is of redeemable value. Close to two minutes of it are sound effects and another minute is dedicated to the same old formula of nonsensical chaos. Getting past the sound, the lyrics are violent, macabre-inspired, and deal with the occult. These have often offended the mainstream masses (including yours truly for a time), but songs dealing with the occult and gross-out lyrics have made entire genres of metal, so Slayer are in a way pioneers here. But overall, the lyrics just seem over-the-top and just somewhat ridiculous.\n\nRegardless of my criticisms, Reign in Blood is not a horrible album. Like I said, the musicians and singer are clearly talented and I acknowledge their influence and recognition in the thrash metal scene. But the album just suffers from too much repetition and follows the same formula over and over again, making Raining Blood the only track that has any memorable qualities. If the songs were just a tad bit slower, longer, and more restrained in their delivery, it could have been quite a bit better. But overall, everything just seems so abrupt and forced. It was almost as if the album was written and recorded on a rushed deadline without much time to reevaluate. I understand that this album is supposed to be about chaos and anger, which is demonstrated quite well. But even in thrash metal, where aggression and speed is in the norm, you cannot simply close the door on melody and a defined song structure for every single song. Had Slayer just been slightly open to the idea of experimentation, Reign in Blood could have truly achieved the status of what many fans already designate it as: a classic.\n",
        "\nSo this is what all the fuss is about? The be-all/end-all of metal? This would make a damn fine EP if it were just Angel Of Death, Epidemic, Criminally Insane and Postmortem/Raining Blood. The other 5 tracks come off as good ideas for a basis of a thrash song, but apparently Jeff Hanneman thought it would be a good idea to stop writing halfway through.\n\nThat's what really kills this album. Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits both showed that Slayer were fully capable of writing fully developed and, dare I say, progressive songs, and that comes through on Angel Of Death and...umm...Angel Of Death. The other 4 good songs are still pretty simple, relatively speaking (Postmortem and Raining Blood both have a few changes; Postmortem with the awesome speedup at the end and Raining Blood with the mosh part to end all mosh parts [none of that metalcore chug-chuggachug shit]), but are still full songs, not something you'd expect from a hardcore punk band.\n\nSo why is this the flagship of Slayer's catalog? I don't fucking know. Show No Mercy and South Of Heaven both have far better songs (although both are significantly slower than this and Hell Awaits), and Hell Awaits is far more evil, menacing, riffy, and fast. Angel Of Death is amazing, but not amazing enough to balance out crap like Necrophobic and Jesus Saves. Crionics and Die By The Sword from SNM and Hell Awaits and At Dawn They Sleep from Hell Awaits all crush Angel Of Death with their awesomeness, and that's just Slayer's body of work (get some Dark Angel, Kreator, Exodus, or even Megadeth and this album just falls flat).\n\nIt's certainly not a bad album, and one every metalhead should own, but it's far from worthy of all the praise it gets. Yup, it's fast, but it's fast for the sake of being fast. Just because you can (and they really can't; this is one of the sloppiest albums I've ever heard) doesn't mean you should. Besides, Dark Angel and Kruiz are faster.\n",
        "\nMetal Blade Records must have had enormous confidence in their young act Slayer, releasing Live Undead after only a year after the band's debut Show No Mercy, before they had a wealth of material from which to draw. The Haunting the Chapel EP had also come out by this point, and it's represented here through \"Captor of Sin\", but hell, if this album were any longer it might have encompassed all of the band's official tracks to its day. Instead, Live Undead is short but sweet, with only seven songs at 22 minutes that flow intuitively like rivulets of red against razor-tracked veins, and despite its brevity, it stands alongside Maiden's Live After Death or Destruction's Live Without Sense as one of the finer 80s live recordings in metal.\n\nTo be honest, though, I'm not sure one could deem this a 'proper' live album. Instead of playing up on a stage in front of strangers, this was recorded in a New York studio to an audience of what I assume were largely friends and acquaintances. It's even been hinted that the band just added crowd noises in after the recording, something producer Bill Metoyer has been close-lipped about when asked. So, to an extent, the studio setting allows for a more controlled environment, and it's no surprise that it sounds quite this good, but judging by the drum sound and the little spoken intros and outros that flow seamlessly with the music, these are at least different versions than the previously released studio takes. For what it's worth, the band sounds great here, with a punishing clarity that allows Araya's vocals and bass to freely wander alongside the dense and meaty guitar tone, while Lombardo thunders away flawlessly.\n\nThe song selection is, of course, kick ass, being taken from only the band's early works. Show No Mercy favorites like \"Die By the Sword\", \"Black Magic\", \"Evil Has No Boundaries\", the title track, and especially \"The Antichrist\" all murder the small 'audience'. All are vibrant and brutal for the time, with perhaps \"The Antichrist\" and \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" shining through the most. These are joined by \"Captor of Sin\", which Tom Araya dedicates to 'all the little cunts who like to spread their legs in the night'; and \"Aggressive Perfector\", which wouldn't be heard again in studio form until the single for \"Seasons in the Abyss\" (1990). It's a mix that any Slayer fan should and would relish, long before they chocked up their discography with the mediocrity of the 90s, and reminds one of more exciting times for the speed/thrash genre.\n\nIn any case, Live Undead is quite pro, even if it's been manipulated somewhat to sound like something it wasn't. Those seeking out a far more substantial live offering from the Californians would be wise to go for Decade of Aggression, which still features a largely quality track listing and includes material from the impeccable South of Heaven and the amazing Reign in Blood, but the consistency within this 22 minute experience cannot be beat if you just want something to get the blood stirred en route to work or your sister's wedding or a court arraignment or whatnot.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI'll be totally honest here; I'm not huge on Slayer. Certainly I don't hate them (fuck, I'm reviewing this, right?), but I find much of their work to suffer from repetitiveness and some mistakes in the studio (Diabolus In Musica, anyone?) But, I will give credit where credit is due, as a number of their separate songs (ie \"Seasons In The Abyss\" or the legendary \"Reign In Blood\") are damn vicious and well put together bits of thrash. The credit is certainly due here.\n\nSlayer's 1983 debut album is pure, raw 80's metal at its finest. It's heavier than much heavy metal at the time, but not quite thrash. The songs are catchy and have just a little of that beloved NWOBHM sound sprinkled on top with buzzaw guitars and screaming, chanting choruses. The first-time band here is overall damn good. Tom Araya, a respiratory therapist at the time, thumps the bass with competence, but it's nothing too special. His voice, however, is legendary. Araya growls and shouts his vocals with precise menace, and his occasional screams are genuinely, jaw-droppingly spine-tingling, and just plain METAL! Jeff Hanneman and the fantastic Kerry King are a duel to be reckoned with, their guitars buzzing the listener's ears like angry wasps. Lastly, Dave Lombardo certainly kicks ass with his drumwork, though he, along with Hanneman and King, would improve greatly on preceding albums, particularly \"Reign In Blood\". On a side note, many have complained of this album's rough and, some say, \"horrible\", production quality. If you want bad quality, listen to Venom's \"Welcome To Hell\" (still an incredible album in its own right), but otherwise fuck off; it's not that bad.\n\nThis album has songs. Great songs. Really, really fucking AWESOME, pure molten metal! No fancy-ass technicality or theatrics, no pansy ballads, none of that shit. \"Show No Mercy\" really does just that; it whoops ass in a non-stop assault of heaviness from beginning to end. The only downside is that many of the songs may be a bit hard to tell apart at first, with nothing particularly special differentiating them. A closer look and a number of re-listens eventually gives each song its own sound and merit. From the killer solos of \"Metal Storm/Face The Slayer\" ( my personal favorite) and \"Black Magic\" to the memorable choruses of \"Fight Till Death\" and \"Die By The Sword\", it all kicks skulls and melts faces.\n\nIf slight amateurishness and rough production isn't your thing, go listen to your fucking Van Halen or something. Otherwise enjoy \"Show No Mercy\", one of the most relentless and purely metal albums of the 80's. Headband till there's nothing left!!!\n",
        "\nLet's face facts: Slayer ran out of their presumably inexhaustible supply of relevance when they ran out of sounding evil. History will record that this transpired between the years of Seasons in the Abyss (1990) and Divine Intervention (1994). Coincidentally, these were the same years in which other big names of the extreme metal genre were experiencing their own difficulty in coming to identity with the changing 90s. The dominance of grunge, 'alternative', British sop rock and the peaking of the rap game. Like Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax and so many others, they felt forced to adapt themselves to this oncoming rush of change, and while they might not have bent so far as others in the declining thrash metal category, we were nevertheless left with the pungent shit-stain that is Diabolus in Musica, an album about as attractive as a fit of irritable bowel syndrome.\n\nWhat the hell am I looking at? Billy Corgin masquerading as a Christian superhero? Or were Tom Araya and the boys finally giving us the reveal that they are not, in fact, nearly so Satanic as one might have believed from their legendary 80s albums. The strange new logo and decidedly 90s cover image (which inspires nothing but remorse) would be one thing, and one thing I expected during a time in which Janes Addiction and Tool were considered the peak of musical artistry, but very quickly does the composition of its content take a dive for the lowest common denominator, the wretched wigga groove metal scene inhabited and dominated by acts like Korn, Machine Head, P.O.D. and whoever else I'm too horrified to recall. Now, don't get me wrong...they attempted to stave this stench off for as long as possible. Divine Intervention was an entirely mediocre record, yes, but it was Slayer being Slayer. Only boring, which no one in their right mind could really want, but that was the worst it could be accused of. An urbanization of their esoteric, interesting subject matter into the burgeoning Information Age.\n\nThe boredom continues here through \"Bitter Peace\", a track that at least teases us into thinking their will be a good thrashin' waiting at the end of this ghetto rainbow. Mundane groove chords stretch on into banality like some sorrow attempt to recapture the magic of Reign in Blood, that flawless exercise of an album that (unfortunately) launched a billion metalcore kids with its inescapable breakdowns. Well, sure enough, the band picks up the pace for some speed/thrash reminiscent of Divine Intervention, only the riff is entirely throwaway and not even remotely evil. The later breakdown sucks, and about the only tolerable point of this song is the period from around 2:57 when the leads break out against a decent but self-derived rhythm guitar. And then, then it all goes to shit, with the total LCD groove metal track \"Death's Head\", the very definition of JUMP DA FUC UP for disenchanted Limp Bizkit expatriates who seek a seance with Satan.\n\nThis was a joke, right? Surely they were having a laugh on us? Oh no, my friends of misery, for \"Stain of Mind\" put the strain on mine. \"Overt Enemy\" offered us political commentary to the beat of the cheesiest chug rhythm the metalcore mosh-squad living on your corner ever could dream of. \"Perversion of Pain\" attempted to bring back the psychedelic, haunting layered Araya vocals of Seasons but forgot the good music to go with them. \"Love to Hate\" clobbered us with another clutter of vapid grooves that missed the mark no matter how hard Paul Bostaph tried to jazz it up. The list of complaints I could write for this album could compete with Black Friday foot traffic at your local Wal*Mart. It sucks, hands down, and even at it's arguable best, the cluttered speed of \"Scrum\" or the clumsy, familiar grooving of \"Screaming from the Sky\" it feels like a half-assed grasp at a paycheck.\n\nI'm surprised Rick Rubin didn't submit this directly to his friends over at Def Jam. Okay, so maybe it's not a rap metal record exactly, but it feels like a clear swerve towards that crowd of collegiates who discovered all their latest faves while loaded at the latest Lollapalooza or Ozzfest. All they needed were some Mike D and Ad Rock guest slots and they could have pushed 2-3 million of these bottom line. And you know something? This all might have been fine if the grooves were good, the notes memorable, the vocal patterns as effective as their yesteryears. Diabolus in Musica is such a dull, creatively bankrupt recording that it makes even its mediocre successors seem like brilliant bulbs of passion and musicianship. Of the many missteps made among the 'Big Four', this is second only to St. Anger in terms of its failure. I don't know about you cats, but I want my Slayer to sound like it originated from Malebolge, not the mall. An icon of perdition, not parachute pants.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe most important thing I could say about this sort of thing (to me, at least,) is that this is the album that Possessed's first sounds most like. Oof, I guess that sounds like kind of a backhanded insult, doesn't it? It's really not; I'm just aware of what I listen to. I listen to death and black and grind; at a fundamental level, I DON'T listen to stuff like this. So my interest in an album like \"Show No Mercy\" is more in its influence, because there's only so much I'm going to get out of it in and of itself. It's neat, but do I ever listen to it? Not really- too close to Judas Priest for me.\n\nSo I guess that's what most people always say about this album and make a big deal about: it's basically Slayer's heavy/speed metal album before \"Hell Awaits\" (or maybe \"Haunting the Chapel\") stormed in and stripped most of that out in favor of a more brackish and deadly sound. Here the game is different; the cheese still permeates it pretty deeply. The falsettos wails aren't vestigial here, if you get what I'm saying- the texture of this music is so firmly entrenched in the tropes of early Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and other big names that Slayer is almost unrecognizable underneath it all. I don't think it's much of a stretch to say that a fundamentally different band is at work here than the one which would end up churning out \"Reign in Blood\" only a few years later- the goals, quite simply, are very different from each other.\n\nIf at this point Slayer wasn't absolutely trying their hardest to be the most vicious, insane, and brutal band in the world, I guess they were just trying to kick out a solid, cool heavy metal album, and I suppose they succeed on that. The riffs are a lot more melodic here- they're not designed to punish the audience so much as seem KICKIN' RAD, and the surprisingly restrained drumming and vocal performances both point to a band more interested in drinking beer and having a Halloween-dark good time than really eviscerating the audience. That's not to say there aren't moments of surprising brutality which would foreshadow the future: the title track is pretty hard to ignore in its viciousness, and \"Black Magic\" seems especially ominous when sandwiched between the other, cuddlier tracks on this record.\n\nHindsight's kind of a curse, really. Save the hate mail- I'm not going to \"get\" this album any more no matter how much you demand I do.\n\nBasically \"Show No Mercy\" suffers from proximity to infinitely more intense music in arm's reach of it; for those of my generation who have always defined Slayer as the most hard-bitten and cruel of the big 4, it's sort of difficult to rationalize that image with what seems at first glance to seem like a pretty restrained, not particularly morbid release from the guys who would later base their careers off nazi death camps and corpsefucking. So much of what you get with this dinosaur, when you're my age, involves mentally drawing the feathers and beak on it and wondering at just how it's going to fly so soon from then. Invariably, it comes off as dated, especially without any sort of nostalgia to attribute to it- there's other, more immediately relevant releases in the band's catalog.\n\nBut as to how it sounds, independent of any history lesson- fun, more or less. It's obviously the most hard-bitten tracks which are the most viscerally appealing; the aforementioned \"Black Magic\" and \"Show No Mercy\" are the absolute standouts, sounding like the earliest Sodom or Possessed material with their thrashing ferocity, tightly-coiled riffing, and alarmingly vociferous vocal performances. This is what makes it so interesting on a track like \"Tormentor,\" where Slayer calls the spirit of Maiden perhaps more fully than anywhre else on the album- the more extreme tracks on this release are such obvious outliers it almost makes you question whether the band themselves were aware of the change that was rapidly taking place in their own style.\n\nReally the most interesting feature of this record is how, well, NORMAL (for want of a better term) it sounds. King and Hanneman's riffs are simple and catchy in the speed metal form, without the explosive and atonal edge that the band would rapidly develop as their signature style, and even King's soloing lacks the cat-in-a-blender quality that he's so legendary for. The sheer consonance of this music (and the amazingly clean singing voice that Araya essentially employs) is a total surprise, even when connected to the very next EP the band would turn out. I think most distinctive of all the pieces in their formative stages, though, are the drums- almost hilariously restrained, straightforward, and heavy metal, without the insistent push that Lombardo would later bring in as a crucial element of the band's sound.\n\nDo I particularly like this? No- this isn't something I would really ever listen to on my own. Is it a necessary part of your collection? Well, of course. And if nothing else, it's a museum that everyone should visit once- even if it's on a field trip of sorts.\n",
        "\n1986 was a pretty sweet year for thrash metal. \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d, \u201cGame Over\u201d, \u201cPeace Sells\u201d, \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, to name a few. And of course, \u201cReign in Blood\u201d. \n\nWell as soon as is starts, you know you\u2019re listening to Slayer. \u201cAngel of Death\u201d has one of the most recognizable screams in metal history and is just a great song from beginning to end. Several things have improved from \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, the production has improved. The guitars are much thicker and heavier but are still not up the same production level as Megadeth or Metallica; but for how fast this album is the guitar works pretty well. The drums sound awesome. The bass is meh\u2026you almost never hear it. Tom\u2019s vocals sound pretty much the same as he did on \u201cHell Awaits\u201d which is not a bad thing at all.\n\nSong writing has not improved though. Hell Awaits just flat out had better riffs. Some of the songs on here deliver at the same level as \u201cHell Awaits\u201d but some of the others just serve as fillers. \u201cAltars of Sacrifice\u201d is a song that doesn\u2019t get enough praise in my opinion, I think it\u2019s amazing. \u201cJesus Saves\u201d starts out with an awesome riff but then just falls flat. Yes, it\u2019s fast and chaotic but it just doesn\u2019t stick in my head. \u201cNecrophobic\u201d is one of those songs that Slayer had to make just to show how fast they could play and oh my god do they play it fast. \u201cPostmortem\u201d is another song that is memorable and one of my favorites. It has an awesome riff but also has the speed that I love. \u201cReborn\u201d is completely forgettable along with, \u201cJesus Saves\u201d and \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d. Pretty much all the other songs are pretty memorable and are just awesome. Dave Lombardo is one crazy drummer. His fills are unbelievable at some points and his double bass is amazing. I just wish Kerry Kind and Jeff would step it up a little like they have on the later albums. \n\nNow I have to discuss something that I always read about when I read Slayer reviews. The solos. These solos could be taken two different ways. Terrible solos that contribute nothing to the song or terrible solos that actually help the song because of how fast the songs are. I look at them as terrible for the most part but they do fit the song. Pretty much random solos that can get old very fast especially when there are multiple solos in a song (most of the songs). \n\nThis is a very good album but I crave more variety. For 1986, you couldn\u2019t get much faster though and for that I really enjoy this album. The songs are good but some fall flat. Still one of Slayer\u2019s best though, I would definitely recommend this. \n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cAltar of Sacrifice\u201d, \u201cPostmortem\u201d, and \u201cAngel of Death\u201d\n",
        "\nWow, I remember when this came out. My cassette player got a good workout of \"Divine Intervention\", Slayer's first album with new drummer Paul Bostaph and their first album since grunge really kicked off in the early 90's. This album is relatively short, clocking in at around 36 and a half minutes. Bostaph kicks this album off with a bang and an excellent drum intro on the first track of the album, \"Killing Fields\", following that up with a great riff and double bass drumming. Soon after, the song goes into mid-paced thrash mode while Tom Araya delivers the vocals with more anger and rage than anything since \"Reign\". The lyrics deal generally with the after-effects of war, akin to \"Eyes of the Insane\" off of Christ Illusion. After the second chorus, the song goes full out thrash with a similar riff that was heard throughout most of the song while Araya repeats \"A choice is made of freewill just like the choice to kill\". \n\nAfter \"Killing Fields\" comes a relatively short and fast track, \"Sex. Murder. Art\", that contains no solos and blazing fast drumming from Paul Bostaph. The main riff sounds evil and intense and grasps the listener right into the song. The issue is the lack of solos, and the fact that the song does not seem complete, especially after the song ends like a door slamming and is unexpected. After this, \"Fictional Reality\" has a somewhat of a groove metal feeling riff to it for the most part, with some interesting vocal effects from Araya and a consistent double bass line from Bostaph. This is easily one of the weaker tracks on the album (not saying much) and is still incredibly brutal. It almost sounds like they listened to \"Vulgar Display of Power\" or \"Slaughter in the Vatican\" to much for this one. However, \"Dittohead\" takes you immediately back to Reign in Blood with its incredibly up-tempo drumming and intro riff. I don't even know how Tom Araya manages to sing the lyrics that fast to fit the music on this song. The lyrics tend to deal with the \"corrupt\" justice system and a problem with violence in the USA at the time. Kerry King plays an incredible solo on this song, probably the best on this album and one of the best Slayer solos of all-time. This track does slow down at parts but is incredibly relentless in pulverizing the senses with outstanding drum fills by Bostaph and speedy guitars from Hanneman/King.\n\n\"Divine Intervention\", the title track and 5th on the album really sets the pace for what is to come. It kicks off with a slow riff and really maintains a mid-paced feel throughout the entire song. Tom Araya's shouting vocals have very bizarre vocal effects that almost make him sound as if he is talking on a telephone or something. They complement the song nicely, however. Like \"Fictional Reality\", this song takes on more of a groove-sounding feel to it (not all the way) before speeding up nicely around the 3-minute mark. This foreshadowed to some extent what was to come on their follow-up album, \"Diabolus In Musica\" (not including \"Undisputed Attitude\" with more of an evil sound to it. On \"Circle of Beliefs\", there is not much of an intro as Tom Araya shouts out his vocals from the first second of the song with some impressive double-bass fills accompanying him, with a short King solo following. The song's lyrics deal with negative aspects of religion (no surprise) and issues with prayer, etc. This song is very well done in the sense of guitar work and \"guitar battles\" featuring the King/Hanneman duo doing what the do best (solos). Like the previous track, Araya's vocals contain bizarre effects that do not help his vocals at parts. This song is more thrashy than most of the second half of the album, and contains a great main riff and closes out with a great outro riff. The seventh song, \"SS-3\" deals with similar lyrical matter (WWII Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich) as \"Angel of Death\" and starts out slow and groove-ish with a catchy first riff leading into Araya's vocals before exploding in to full-out thrash mode around the 2 minute mark with a blazing solo by Jeff Hanneman shortly there after. Like all of the tracks on this album, Paul Bostaph does a great job of replacing Dave Lombardo here. At 2:47, if listening carefully with headphones, in the right headphone you can even hear Jeff Hanneman burping! Cool little oddity indeed. After that, Kerry King launches into his first solo of the song, which after some Tom Araya vocals and a great closing riff, \"SS-3\" is finished. This is easily one of the best tracks on this album in my opinion. Next we have \"Serenity in Murder\", which after an incredibly fast intro really does not go anywhere from there and slows down dramatically from there. Araya's vocals seem to really suffer through most of the verses of this song, mostly due to more bizarre vocal effects (prominent in this album) and once again, this song has a very groove-oriented sound to it. The song finally picks up in speed at the 2 minute mark with a Kerry King solo followed by the outro verse in the song. \n\nThe next song is easily the best on this record, no doubt about it and the song I played the most. The haunting intro of \"213\" really sets the stage for a Slayer classic and one of their most under appreciated songs. The song deals with Jeffrey Dahmer and his killings. The song is named \"213\" after his apartment number. The main riff that starts around the 1:40 mark of the song is truly captivating and haunting, with Araya putting intense rage in to his vocal delivery here. The addicting chorus and descriptive lyrics almost shock the listener and keep them wanting more. The \"I need a friend\" part is almost scary as it leads into a great Jeff Hanneman solo and one of the better ones on this album from him. The dark and moody atmosphere of this song is indeed one that has not been repeated in a Slayer song since and was featured in \"Dead Skin Mask\" to a certain extent from \"Seasons\". The last track on the album, \"Mind Control\" is a blazing thrasher and the perfect ending to an outstanding song. The song contains a brutal verse riff, with a solo each from Hanneman and King and is once again reminiscent of \"Reign in Blood\"\n\nThis album is truly one of Slayer's best and is a brutal and haunting sonic assault with no track sounding near the same like \"Reign in Blood\". Some say that this is a \"Reign\" rehash, but if you listen to it again, you will clearly see that this is false. This album seems to be the overshadowed one in the Slayer discography, thanks to the success of grunge in the 1990's and \"Seasons in the Abyss\" being a classic release, with the horrendous \"Diabolus in Musica\" soon to follow. Bottom line: This album rules.\n",
        "\nAlright seriously, some people need to relax with this album! This album is far from perfect and I can mention a handful of other bands that have the magnum opus thrash album in their discography. This album is 30 minutes long and has the same thing in every song: fast palm mutes and soloing that has a wah pedal and is unorganized with no bounds to any guitar scales. I love Slayer and this is an album that sparks interest in the speed/thrash metal genre, but it is not their best. Sure, it is their fastest and most brutal album, but it doesn\u2019t compete with some of their albums that I will mention at the conclusion of my review. \n\nThe first track, \u201cAngel of Death\u201d, with the opening scream by the banshee Tom Araya is the best song on the album. The band is playing fast and is not just palm muting guitar riffs, but instead are playing power chords and sliding up and down the guitar neck. The bridge of the song is catchy, especially when they slow it down and regain their speed through the vocal lines. Then we get to the solos and the song just falls apart. The solo is terrible, like most Slayer solos are, but the riffs under the guitar solo are fast and Teutonic. The lyrics in this song are violent and malicious, making it the best song on the album. \n\n\"Piece by Piece\u201d and \u201cNecrophobic\u201d are very short songs, but are fast and have no dry segments except the soloing. I like the bridge in \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d at 1:29 where the vocals are rapid fire and the guitar notes are rung out to give it a doom-like aura. This song does not have a guitar solo, which is why it is one of the better songs on the album. The opening riff and transitional riff in \u201cNecrophobic\u201d is killer and the song is one of Slayer\u2019s fastest songs, especially after the guitar solo. \n\n\"Altar of Sacrifice\u201d is, in my opinion, the weakest song on the album. The intro is spectacular with quick strikes of the individual notes. I like the vocal lines with the underlying guitar riff. However, this song has far too many uninspiring guitar solos that rely on the wah-pedal with no nexus to guitar scales. By the end of the song you have lost all interest in the song. Like \u201cAltar of Sacrifice\u201d, \u201cJesus Saves\u201d is, in contrast, very similar. So what you will get in this song is an excellent mid-paced intro until 1:05 when the band goes on a blitz with speed. We get 3 different solos in this under 3 minute song and, yes, they all suck and do you want to guess what is under the guitar solos? If you guessed fast palm mutes, you are correct!\n\n\"Criminally Insane\u201d has some cool guitar riffs that have sliding power chords during the verses and the bridge is appealing. \u201cReborn\u201d is a fast and \u201cin your face\u201d song. \u201cEpidemic\u201d has excellent fast slide guitar riffs with fast hammer-ons and pull-offs between the verses and a vintage Tom Araya scream. These songs are all around 2 minutes and are above average, but feature the awful Slayer guitar solos: fast guitar picking with the wah pedal. \n\n\"Postmortem\u201d is my favorite song on this album and is underrated Slayer song. The song is mid-paced for the first two verses, we are able to comprehend what Tom is saying during his vocal line and the scream at 1:45 is one of best screams in the Tom Araya archives. At 2:15 the band picks the speed up and at 2:47 the band goes on a frenzy with fast guitar riffs and a memorable last verse that will make you want to split your neck. Oh by the way, no solos in this song (thank God).\n\nWhat more can I say about the last song \u201cRaining Blood?\u201d This is one of the most jaw-dropping songs in heavy metal. With a storm in the intro and the dual guitars harmonizing that later go berserk with speed into the verses, what is there not to like? The verses are power chords with coherent vocal lines. The bridge is reminiscent of the beginning with the harmonies produced by the guitar. At 2:49 all hell is let loose and the band produces the sickest sound in heavy metal with fast palm mutes and screaming guitars that sound like you are getting your teeth drilled. A little strange and bizarre that a thrash album would exit with ambiance of rainfall; but I guess the album is called \u201cReign in Blood.\u201d \n\nIn conclusion, this album is spectacular, but not perfect. This is not Slayer\u2019s best album. I would recommend \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d or \u201cHell Awaits\u201d because they actually seem like real official albums. \u201cHell Awaits\u201d has an aura of being an epic album with an enigmatic and sanguine vibe. \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d is my favorite because each song has a different structure and the guitar riffs are a grab bag. \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d and \u201cSeasons of the Abyss\u201d are also damn good albums. \u201cReign in Blood\u201d has good characteristics of a thrash/speed metal and I won\u2019t get into that because anyone who listens to metal has this album. The one thing that makes this far from a perfect album is the terrible guitar soloing as they all sound the same after a while. It\u2019s not even music after awhile, just noise. Also, the fast palm mutes underlying the solos are abysmal throughout most of the album. This album is a colossal inspiration to thrash/speed metal and to me as well. I am not degrading Slayer, but this album is not as inspiring as their aforementioned albums and the killer EP \u201cHaunting the Chapel.\u201d Here is the break own of each song on the album: \n\nAngel of Death: 9/10\nPiece by Piece: 9/10\nNecrophobic: 8/10\nAltar of Sacrifice: 6/10\nJesus Saves: 7/10\nCriminally Insane: 7/10\nReborn: 8/10\nEpidemic: 7/10\nPostmortem: 10/10\nRaining Blood 9/10\n\nTotal = 80%\n",
        "\nSlayer\u2019s \u201cReign in Blood\u201d has an infamous legacy in metal, and was pretty groundbreaking at its time in terms of its almost constant barrage of brutality and speed. It\u2019s fast and aggressive, sure, but does the fact this album is considered so influential necessarily make it a great album?\n\nMost of the songs on this album are ridiculously short. Only three clock in over two minutes, and only two break four. This leaves us with a ten song album that clocks in at under half an hour. Due to all of the songs being so short, this album feels less written than its predecessor, \u201cHell Awaits,\u201d and feels like a jam than a completed album. Furthermore, almost all of the songs are ridiculously fast paced. Almost as though the band said, \u201cLet\u2019s see how fast we can play,\u201d and topped it off with Tom Araya screaming evil sounding shit over it.\n\nWe kick things off with Angel of Death, an amazing opener, beginning with fast heavy riffing, and being, to my knowledge, one of the last songs featuring Tom Araya\u2019s high pitched shrieking wail, which becomes a barbaric yell. The song continues on brutally as Tom informs us that the holocaust was bad or something. His voice sounds all out evil, the tone of the guitars and drums are brutal, and this song features something that\u2019s pretty rare on this album: A breakdown, which becomes a misplaced head banging piece where Tom describes graphic details of the holocaust and Josef Mengele\u2019s victims. Then we get to the solo. Often times on this album the solos feel like they\u2019re just fretting random shit on the high strings and seeing what happens. In some cases it works. In some it doesn\u2019t. For the most part, I probably won\u2019t even bring up the solos again, since \u201crandom fretting\u201d seems to cover most of them. Tom Araya screams \u201cAngel of Death\u201d a few more times, and so ends the longest song you\u2019ll be hearing in a while.\n\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d and \u201cCriminally Insane\u201d have a rather mid-paced intro, which break out into a relentless thrash fest. \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d holds water mostly because of its placement on the album. Being the second track, the idea of relentless thrashing has yet to grow stale. \u201cCriminally Insane,\u201d on the other hand has always been what I considered to be a highlight of the albums middle part. Not as good as either the opener or the closer, but good compared to most of the middle. Neither \u201cNecrophobic\u201d nor \u201cAltar of Sacrifice\u201d fuck around before punching you in the face with speed, although right after Toms scream at the end of \u201cNecrophobic\u201d there is about\u2026 one second of a slow riff, while \u201cAltar\u201d slows down just a little while Tom discusses how awesome Satan is. \u201cReborn\u201d and \u201cEpidemic\u201d thrash almost all the way through, and do absolutely nothing noteworthy. \n\n\u201cJesus Saves\u201d sounds like two songs that they didn\u2019t feel like working on anymore, so rather than finish either, they combined both. Almost half the song is a somewhat slow chug, with some riffing over it, and then half way through, out of nowhere, it just stops and becomes another fucking thrasher. And then it just kind of stops and you wonder what the fuck just happened. \n\n\u201cPostmortem\u201d is interesting, seeing as it does the exact same thing \u201cJesus Saves\u201d does, but on some copies, it actually is split, so that the second half of the song is actually the intro to Raining Blood. This song actually makes it work much better than \u201cJesus Saves\u201d though, and it becomes another highlight of the album\u2019s middle section.\n\nAnd then begins \u201cRaining Blood.\u201d The eerie guitar feedback. The rain. The almost tribal drumming. The well known riff. After the minute of build up, there is a part that sounds like every other song on the album, but as it goes on, it really stops relying on speed and pays off that intense build up for a while, as that famous riff plays, until Tom Araya finally screams \u201cRAINING BLOOD!!\u201d The solo sounds like a chaotic mess, but somehow the nature of it works well for the build up to that final clap of thunder, as Slayer leaves you with echoing rain.\n\nAt the end of the day, \u201cReign in Blood\u201d is an album you can only enjoy if you\u2019re the type who just wants to thrash to really fast paced noise. Despite how highly regarded this album is, Slayer had already done this type of music on Haunting the Chapel and Hell Awaits, and much better I might add, and would continue to do it, and again, better, for a few more albums. I can\u2019t even honestly say this is a good starting place for people getting into Slayer. \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d would be better suited, since it offers a taste of both brutal thrashing Slayer as well as the darker more ambient stuff they did. Unless you want a half an hour of senseless brutality, bookended by two good songs, then forget this album, forget all its praise, and forget its legacy. Slayer can, and have, done better, and it\u2019s a little sad that no matter what they accomplish or have accomplished, this album will always be what the band is most remembered for.\n",
        "\nEvery album tells a story, and the ones that tend to be best remembered are the ones that tell of great feats that are yet to come. Such words as \u201cpioneering\u201d and \u201cinnovative\u201d generally tends to come along with such works, and for the dark world of extreme metal, an incredible amount of significance can be attached to 1985. While the foundation for what now is recognized as the dueling shadows of death and black metal was already being laid by the likes of Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer and a few others, it was that heavily occult fixated, too wicked for the mainstream yet somehow captivating to them, member of the Big 4 Slayer that really left an impression. Many will point to the preceding EP \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d or the 3rd LP \u201cReign In Blood\u201d as the more historically significant releases, but in itself, \u201cHell Awaits\u201d stands above the two in terms of ambition and scope.\n\nBetween the raw intensity that oozes forth between each blinding riff and blurring beat, and the extremely wicked imagery portrayed in what was probably the most lyrically controversial album of its day, this works on every level and leaves little room for nuance. The familiar tendency towards cooking the engines at full speed that was heard on \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d is still present here, but the song lengths have been stretched out a good deal, almost as if prophesizing the approach that Dark Angel would undertake on \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d. Likewise, the atmosphere of dark, murky vileness is established in a muddier guitar tone that is one step farther from the heavy yet crisp character of \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d and the undead cesspool of sludge that was \u201cReign In Blood\u201d. This is an album that could be seen as middle of the road when accounting for the band\u2019s history, but taken for what it is, is nothing but an extreme slaughter fest where riffs are plentiful and breaks are few.\n\nIntroduced by a dismal layering of guitar noise and obscured mutterings, the album beings its descent into the hall of flames with the riveting title song. Some of the better riffs heard out of the band are to be found on here, particularly the slow paced build up once the instruments have all come in which is almost akin to a reinterpretation of \u201cAm I Evil?\u201d, and the light speed verse riffing which is rhythmically precise, yet chromatic and obscured to the point of suggesting a band like Cannibal Corpse should seek similar territory for a musical take on the exploits of zombies. The solo trade offs between King and Hanneman are the only areas where a slight remnant of the band\u2019s NWOBHM past remains, but the streams of pentatonic shred licks are already starting to make way for the wild, atonal madness that would become commonplace just a year later.\n\nAs things progress, the dark tales take on some new twists, both musically and lyrically. Not one to be tied down by constant nods to the occult, Slayer offers a strong helping of human depravity in \u201cKill Again\u201d, which is a little bit shorter but still fairly long for a full speed thrasher. \u201cAt Dawn They Sleep\u201d goes into the moonlit world of vampire exploits, and shows the band beginning to settle into the creepy chromatic melodic material in the riff work that brought forth \u201cRaining Blood\u201d and \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d, though in a much more percussive and jostling fashion. All the while, Araya\u2019s vocal interpretation is notably rough and angry, almost like a more primal version of James Hetfield with the occasional super-high note. \u201cPraise Of Death\u201d and \u201cNecrophilliac\u201d come off as two sides of a similar coin, one being longer and more involved that the other, but both containing a similar assortment of blurred tremolo riffs with occasional harmonic runs that sound like a choir of tortured souls.\n\nInterestingly enough, things get really different towards the end of the album. \u201cCrypts Of Eternity\u201d is the only song on here where there is any overt tendencies back towards the NWOBHM character of \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d in the riff work, though it is a bit obscured by the darker guitar sound and overall production. The conventional minor key riff and jazzy drumming during the intro almost sounds like an elaborate take on Iron Maiden\u2019s early work, and even when things get tonally ambiguous and chromatic, the overall feel is much more formulaic and heavy metal-like. The closer \u201cHardening Of The Arteries\u201d cooks like the previous thrashers, but the main riff sounds almost exactly like a number of riffs that would later be used by Deicide and Cannibal Corpse to define the early 90s death metal scene. Literally all the band would have to do to become overt death metal on this song would be to bring in Chris Barnes and have Araya just play the bass.\n\nWhile this doesn\u2019t quite get the same level of accolades from people who are not diehard followers of all things thrash as does \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, this is the better representation of how the band paved the way for the outer fringes of metal\u2019s extreme realm, and ultimately the better album. There\u2019s just so more to grab onto here, more time for the songs to full realize their potential, and more of a measured approach by all in the band to keep things organized and coherent while they challenge the tempo barrier that determined the sound of the time. This is Slayer at their creative peak, though personal preference gives me bias towards their debut. Basically, if pure thrash is the game, \u201cHell Awaits\u201d is the leadoff player in Slayer\u2019s catalog.\n",
        "\nThe progression of thrash metal away from its lightning speed orthodoxy is a touchy subject for some, and perhaps this is most the case insofar as Slayer is concerned. Being the band that set the standard for how extreme thrash metal could get, and also paving the way for the emerging death metal scene alongside Sepultura and Possessed, any notion of the band changing direction is sure to meet with resistance. It would thus seem ironic that the band\u2019s 4th LP \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d is mostly well received by the diehard faithful, but a full listening of the album quickly reveals that for all of the heraldry of Slayer allegedly slowing down or getting intelligent, this doesn\u2019t really venture too far off the reservation.\n\nIt is easy to get caught up in the band\u2019s influential place in history and lose track of the fact that like most bands, Slayer\u2019s evolution from a faster and wickeder version of NWOBHM to where they are today was a gradual and consistent one. When taking the melodic contours of the creepy, chromatic riff work, it would be better to assert that Slayer\u2019s biggest stylistic shift occurred between \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d and \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d, rather than between this one and \u201cReign In Blood\u201d. Actually, when considering the musical themes at play here, this could almost be regarded as a sequel to the band\u2019s wildly heralded and frequently cited 1986 LP, with perhaps a slightly more elaborate approach.\n\nFrom the eerie prelude of the opening title song, the atmosphere is grim, yet a bit more supernatural and looming as opposed to violent and bludgeoning. The occasional employment of acoustic sounds, coupled with some minimalist track layering to bring further depth to a feeling of slow descent into obscurity paints a much more vivid, yet equally horrifying picture to this album\u2019s predecessor. The slowed down tempo does paint the landscapes with a forward looking death/doom brush, though Araya\u2019s vocals are still pretty well locked into the typical Metallica meets Satan shout. In essence, this band\u2019s ventures into continually darker territory, in no small part because of the dark and swampy guitar tone, marks the closest flirtation that the band has come with death metal, with the vocals literally being the only thing that keeps this from being in the same genre as \u201cLeprosy\u201d and \u201cSlowly We Rot\u201d.\n\nAs the album unfolds, the familiar combination of rapid paced beats, punishing riff work and terrifying imagery that is more suited to the earlier material returns with perhaps a slightly greater helping of slower breaks here and there. \u201cSilent Scream\u201d and \u201cGhosts Of War\u201d might as well be holdovers from \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, minus that the riff work is a little bit less blurred and more clearly defined. The former, in particular, showcases a unique ability for scaring the living daylights out of the listener while hitting socially sensitive territory in an intelligent way, perhaps even more so than in the case of \u201cAngel Of Death\u201d. But among the more intricate and politically motivated songs is \u201cMandatory Suicide\u201d, which takes things down a bit in the tempo department and ups the heaviness factor, though it\u2019s hard to pay much attention to all of that as the lyrics lay out the gruesome imagery of 18 to 25 year old men laying in pools of blood on some unnamed battlefield.\n\nAs things draw to a frightening close, there are two lasting impressions left in the closing couple of songs. The cover of \u201cDissident Aggressor\u201d sees the band all but crossing over into traditional doom metal territory as their sludgy, dreary guitars culture the arcane Judas Priest number into something murky enough to challenge the material on Black Sabbath\u2019s debut, though it also shows the vocals clashing a bit as Araya\u2019s almost monotone yells fall short of emulating Halford\u2019s nimble notes. But with the conclusion of the album in \u201cSpill The Blood\u201d, an even more haunting yet very similar feel to the one that kicked off the album in \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d emerges, first as a dark, droning acoustic guitar line, and then manifesting in yet another chromatic doom sequence, but this time giving off a sense of marching to an impending fate rather than falling into oblivion. In much the same sense as \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, this album proves to be something of a loose conceptual work musically, with a closing that heavily resembles the opening, though here it\u2019s a bit less obvious.\n\nIt can\u2019t be said enough that there were no major missteps made by Slayer in the 80s or up to the mid 90s even, though the total body of work from these eras is not quite flawless, despite how massive influential it is. Of all the members of the Big 4 who made their mark on mainstream culture in the name of metal, Slayer will most likely go down as the most unlikely of the bunch given their relevance to underground metal. \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d could be seen as a tame venture in that its approach is a bit more consumable to those who can\u2019t get into the thrash until you die attitude of what came before. But truth be told, this is an album that will pull most hipsters out of their comfort zone as much as \u201cReign In Blood\u201d will. But still, the greatest accomplishments of this fold are to be found in their younger days, where the band is perhaps not as easily identified with present day metal conventions.\n",
        "\nSlayer's debut \"Show No Mercy\" can be best summed up with the word revolutionary. This was the birth of extreme metal as we know it. Venom may have started it, but Slayer perfected it. The guitars still have a distinct NWOBHM flavor to them that's undeniably tasty. Slayer's stylistic direction was largely influenced by legends like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Venom. Slayer would go on to develop and perfect their own sound in their future releases, but this is where Slayer were at their youngest and hungriest. \n\nThe lyrics try their best to be offensive but often come off as laughable as the band hadn't yet developed in that department. The songwriting comes off a bit like a bunch of teenagers obsessed with the occult and Satan, which is exactly what they were at the time. The influence of this album is widespread. Thrash giants like Kreator, Sepultura and other European heavyweights took their inspiration from here. \n\nThe guitar duo of Hanneman/King would quickly go on to establish themselves as the most influential duo after Downing/Tipton of the legendary British heavy metal band, Judas Priest. Dave Lombardo doesn't quite push the limits of extreme metal drumming here like in \"Reign in Blood\", but for 1983, this was quite fresh, like a faster, more intense style of NWOBHM drumming. Tom Araya's hellish high-pitched screams and his spitfire delivery of the lyrics were completely outrageous for its time.\n\nSlayer were possibly the first band alongside Metallica to possess that signature 'bay area crunch' that rubbed off on every other band in the scene. The riffs found on this album take the best of Judas Priest and Venom and push them to a whole new level of intensity never seen or heard before. The blasphemous lyrics and complete disregard for record sales or achieving fame is exactly what made them famous later. Surprisingly, the riffs have an inherent 'catchiness' that makes them get stuck in your head forever. Also worth noting is that despite the one-dimensional nature of the songs, they all stand out individually with their own identity and keeps this album from becoming repetitive. \n\nAdmittedly, these songs are best heard live as the production is a bit lacking sometimes. The drumming doesn't seem to be have dynamics or intricacy as it comes off as a steady, unrelenting background noise that is only decent at best. \n\n\"Evil Has No Boundaries\" starts off with a demented King Diamond like shriek from Araya before the voracious riffing kicks in to a steady drum beat. The guitar solo is actually better than the ones in \"Reign in Blood\". They're not excessively squealy and are a little more comprehensible. \"The Antichrist\" is another solid, but predictable thrasher. The main riff has a distinct 'upbeat' quality to it that Slayer further explored past this album. \"Die By The Sword\" dishes out more of the same, although the song is a bit more adventurous and offers more in terms of variety with some punishing mid-paced sections accompanying the chorus \"Die by the sword!..\" which is barked out with hostility by Araya.\n\n\"Fight Till Death\" sounds like an early mid-paced Kreator song, The lyrics and song title does seem a bit immature but the riffing kicks ass, so no complaints overall. \"Metal Storm/Face the Slayer\" is the longest song, clocking in at a whopping 5 minutes by Slayer's usual standards. The track is a lethal mix of Venom-esque riffing and the old British 'gallop' made famous by Iron Maiden. The solos are fast but tend to be very much melodic in character, a bit like the ones from Metallica's debut. \"Black Magic\" is the best Slayer song ever and the definitive introduction to the genius of both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. The intro of the song seems to slowly fade in and develops into one of the most memorable evil riffs crafted this side of \"Raining Blood\". Another memorable moment is the crunchy mid-paced groove that kicks in at around the 3-minute mark, reminding me a bit of Metallica's 'Four Horsemen'.\n\n\"Tormentor\" sees more NWOBHM influenced speed metal from Slayer. Even the style of lyric-writing draws heavily from early Iron Maiden, more specifically the albums Iron Maiden and Killers. \"Final Command\" is more Priest influenced but definitely in the same mold as \"Tormentor\". Araya tries his hand at singing on \"Crionics\" and makes his best Rob Halford impersonation. The riffing sees more of that vintage Iron Maiden 'galloping' riffs. \"Show No Mercy\", the title track sees more of the same, by this time the approach gets a little redundant. \n\nReign in Blood may be my favorite album by this band like many fans, but Slayer's impressive debut is every bit as important in the development of this genre. It truly captures the aggression and hunger that the thrash metal scene had in its earliest days of existence. 1983 was the year that thrash metal truly started to distinguish itself from NWOBHM. No matter what they did later, they will forever be an integral part of the scene and for that, and they will forever have my respect.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026see the sky burning, the gates are ablaze, Satan waits eager to merge\u2026\u201d\n\nOf Slayer\u2019s entire catalog, the three songs on Haunting the Chapel are perhaps their dirtiest, most unloving inventions. There\u2019s a friendless, merciless singularity about the triad, some sibling bond that bestows a unique oneness in them, like three Antichrists born of the same womb that have simultaneously risen where there were none for thousands of years. Any force thrown against this ep\u2026Creeping Death, Fistful of Metal, Apocalyptic Raids, Sentence of Death...just deflects off its impregnable field that's as mean and unforgiving as De Sade, black as slave hatred, and actively horrific as a live grenade rolling around the floor of a maternity ward. \n\nBy oneness I mean that if these were recorded years apart from each other, they would not hold the same import. They are one of the same mood concocted by the fiery-eyed foursome at their best. One is easily as cold-blooded and callous as the next, more so than any consecutive trio of Slayer tracks on any release, and I believe one speck of up-temponess anywhere on this would\u2019ve destroyed the trilogy. \n\n\u201cChemical Warfare\u201d is the first to awaken, slow to stir at first, then with a squealing slide of the fretboard charges like a bloodshot minotaur breathing soot and with a chip on its shoulder the size of the underworld. A few timing and speed changes cue the songwriting factor, and a chorus that is as stone impervious as it is dynamic is the centerpiece of the track. Araya is perhaps at his most diabolic on this ep, lungs searing, carrying the lyrics with convincing cruelty that are printed right on the back cover for all nuns to see. Halfway through the track it force feeds you the speed realm with King\u2019s and Hanneman\u2019s fingerwork unrelenting in its swift ferocity, then devolves into a cave-in of propulsion and structure that few songs have ever matched. \n\nAraya laughs. \n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll take you down into the fire\u2026\u201d\n\nSide two: \u201cCaptor of Sin\u201d. Yet another chorus dominates a track that is one of the few to begin with a solo. A downplayed main riff enlivens with the breath of many structural creatures, usually altered right after the chorus with interchanging timing and tempos between a host of intimidating solos. The title track is another dual identity vandal, first plowing through with a vengeful main riff that\u2019s potently molded to a brash vocal delivery, uncommon cymbal work is a plus, then at the center point discharges frenetic speed and blaring, high-strung solos to cease the ep\u2019s life like a deathblow. \n\nSolos fly by more maniacally than on the debut and Dave Lombardo\u2019s drumwork is strides ahead of its average performance there. With a mere three songs that laid anything close to \u201cCrionics\u201d to rest, the four-piece paralyzed their fans with awe, blew the socks off of every other band out there, and triple split their underground stock that Brian Slagel couldn\u2019t be anymore ecstatic to own. \n\n\u201c\u2026Lucifer rules supreme\u2026\u201d \n\n\u201cAggressive Perfector\u201d did not appear on the original ep and is a totally different (weaker) animal.\n",
        "\n\"...blasting our way through the boundaries of hell, no one will stop us tonight...\"\n\nWhat's the nostalgic stare? Unless you're around five years old, everyone does it. It's daydreaming about a time in your life when things seemed better, brighter, and perhaps even more sensible than they are now. It involves some sort of hindsight that makes that time appear more enchanted than it probably was...people or places you miss, things you had - an atmosphere slain by time. The older you get, the more it happens. My stare involves discovering a young underground scene and the enigmatic bands that populated it, so if you should happen to see me at work or at the bar or waiting at a stoplight locked in some sort of gaze, you know what's going on.\n\nIt's around April or May 1984 in one such instance that causes me to stare into space now. I'm going home on the 8th grade shuttle bus when I'm first hearing Slayer. Walkman on, my eyes stare at the back of the seat in front of me, jaw's slack, and I can't believe what's being pumped through my headphones. A new acquaintance of mine at school taped two songs for me of this band for which I had only seen one devastating picture of (http://i154.photobucket.com/albums/s264/gutterscream/IMG_0010.jpg) that I've hardly seen anywhere since. Those songs were \"Crionics\" and \"Show No Mercy\". \"Crionics\", while more melodic, progressively traditional, and contrived (I would learn later on) for a Slayer tune, was still pretty much heavier than a lot of what I'd already heard, but \"Show No Mercy\" was just total destruction of the boundaries. Savagery and aggression were at the gate and screaming. This was the be all-end all of metal tracks for me, and to this day despite all the stuff that has been released since, I'm still in awe of this song. \n\nShow No Mercy is one of the heaviest, most antagonistic albums grooved in that pre-'84 commercial radio and NWOBHM-bloated era. Along with Kill 'Em All, Forged in Fire and a very short list of other albums, it's a signal flare that burned through the layered fleece of British acts that weren't commercial or well-known, but were cousins in their semblance of sound from the earliest of Mythra to the fading pulse of Spartan Warrior. It just barely reached the surface where the scene was ruled by major labels, their profit margins and their approved bands. We'd like to think the record automatically lit the metal scene on fire, but it didn't. \n\n\"...Satan watches all of us, smiles as some do his bidding...\"\n\nSo, what in Slayer's unknown repertoire put them over the edge? Speed, vocals and attitude. Bands dishing it out with pure disdain weren't plentiful. Motorhead, Venom, maybe Raven and Exciter, some Anvil, the six-month old Kill 'Em All, punk - hell, MC5 were sometimes more of a bully than the early metal bands. Likewise, Slayer took and gave no crap - the handful of NWOblah blah rhythms they siphoned off their older peers prevail with a level of brawn and intensity that would go hand in hand with this new upsurge in rhythmic velocity, this dissident speed-picking that would be forever known as the bedrock of thrash metal. Change anything else you want - vocal range, drumwork, throw in a saxophone, whatever - without this, it isn't thrash (not that anyone had a clue at the time). \n\nAdd to this the final frontier - Araya's deep, diabolical, and unabashed vocal delivery (that really only Cronos and a demo-entrenched Tom Warrior were doing) that was spouting out foul devil-skinned lyrics to match (at a level that really only Venom, Mercyful Fate, and a very unknown Hellhammer were penning). With the standards being shattered left and right, one hoped it was only a matter of time before poor out-of-the-loop metal fans put down Circus Magazine (or listened to this dorky fourteen year old waving the record around like a Nascar flagman) and took notice. \n\n\"...you never should have come this far...\" \n\nWith a frenzied solo and one of the first of many Araya screams, \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" is born, kicking and screaming, centered around a chorus that includes as far as I know their sole attempt at backing vocals. Two future staples are up next, \"Antichrist\" and \"Die By the Sword\", a pair of rhythm-heavy tracks that are way more structurally-driven than anything breakneck and can mislead the listener into thinking the opener is a fluke, a one-off bruiser, and that's when vaunted \"Fight Til Death\" walks in like a gorilla that's missed its last ten meals. With its frightfully dramatic chorus, wild repeating and off-kilter main riff, and unrelenting speed, \"FTD\" just may be the first bonafide thrash creature recorded for mass consumption outside the Metallica camp. Hanneman and King team up to usher in \"Metalstorm/Face the Slayer\" with a burst of hardened Euro-drama riffs that serve as an appetizer to its violent, near blow-by-blow lyrics. \n\nOkay, in order for \"Black Magic\"'s mighty rising-from-the-depths opening to be truly effective, you have to have had to flip the side (which we all had to do), and headphones didn't hurt. What the cd doesn't offer are those extra five or six seconds where you acknowledge your own astonishment for side one. Yeah, sounds lame, but it happened. The more methodical \"Tormentor\" prepares the quick attack of \"Final Command\", easily the most frantic speed-chaser of the bunch with a pair of screams that awaken the aforementioned melody of \"Crionics\", a tune laden with traditional riffs coated in the black chrome of Slayer's unprescribed heaviness and ignites the pyre of the monstrous title track that can blow holes in ships' hulls. From the first hammering blows of Lombardo's intro (who was still in high school and had yet to come into his own), \"SNM\" is nothing but bone saw speed, vibrating pain, and the shrilling, shrieking, and salivating end to an lp that should've turned the underworld upside down. It was a jarring, ocean-heavy wake-up call that drowned me in fear, bewilderment, and hope, yet I survived. No one played a track like that. Not Venom. Not Exciter. Not Metallica. Not Anvil. Not Mercyful Fate. No one.\n\nNo one.\n\n...I am the menace in your eyes, the one you can't escape...\n",
        "\nI can easily guess what metalheads of that era had been expecting from Slayer when this came out. Probably, it was something heavier, faster and in general more aggresive than the band's uncompromising previous full-length releases. However, it takes a lot of guts and great songs to do what Slayer did. No one had expecting this: an album featuring much slower songs in comparison to 1986's \"Reign In Blood\", yet riffs even more evil and heavy-as-fuck.\n\n\"Reign In Blood\" was an incarnation of destruction: limb-cutting, neck-breaking, straight-forward thrash metal. Violence unleashed at all directions, the aftermath of hatred that has been inhibited for ages. \"South of Heaven\" sounds to me like an attempt to display what a corrupt, meta-apocalyptic world would be like. Just as Raining Blood ends with the sound of the falling rain, South Of Heaven begins with an ominous riff, and the unsuspecting listener might even think \"it can't be much heavier than Black Sabbath\". And it's not, but it's just as dark and sinister as Sabbath's s/t or Paranoid, but this darkness is presented through the prism of 80's contemporary extreme metal.\n\nSick riffs and tempo changes all over the album give the listener a feeling of uneasiness, whereas the atonal solos seem to be a little more melodic than those of previous albums. Lyrical themes are just what you would expect from Slayer, but did you really want anything else? Pain, torment, Satan, anti-Christianity, afterlife, war, death... all those good ol' Slayer themes. Tom Araya is still one of the best vocalist in thrash metal, perhaps the only one who has ever literally yelled in a melodic way, which is his performances both here and in the \"Seasons in the Abyss\" album, and his contribution to the lyrics is really reinvigorating for Slayer.\n\nOnly flaw of the album is that the melodies are sometimes too apparent, to the point where one would wish for more atonality or a slightly higher tempo.\n\nAll in all, if you don't own this album, you should definitely buy it. But, I would definitely choose \"Reign In Blood\" or \"Seasons in the Abyss\" over this. That is, because \"Reign In Blood\" has a certain quality that Slayer has never managed to achieve ever since and \"Seasons...\" is the perfect combination between the routes that \"Reign In Blood\" and \"South Of Heaven\" took. Dig!\n\nPS: the cover of Judas Priest's \"Dissident Aggressor\" is one of the best covers ever recorded for a studio album.\n",
        "\nSlayer have built a reputation of not really evolving musically (or in any other way for that matter), and this album is a testament to nothing but that. Their 2006 offering is far superior to 2001's God Hates Us All, which delved into hardcore and 1998's Diabolus in Musica which showed slight experimentation with groove.\n\nFirst up, it's the drums. While Paul Bostaph is a thrash veteran, having played with the likes of Forbidden and Testament and was a worthy replacement for Lombardo, the presence of the original drummer is more than noticeable. Dave's performance by no means falls short of anything we've grown accustomed from him, absolutely top-notch drum work.\n\nNext up is the second half of the rhythm section, which- unsurprisingly- remains almost impossible to hear... Then again, this isn't exactly news for Slayer-- Or thrash metal in general. Even Slayer's arguably best offering Reign in Blood had a practically silent bass track.\n\nThe vocals are Tom Araya's usual scream-your-guts-out delivery. In case you don't know what that sounds like, picture a raving madman screaming at the top of his lungs. The fact that the man is nearing his fifties makes it all the more impressive, so I can't really complain here.\n\nThe guitar work... Well, can't really complain here either. The riffs are just as fast as they were in thrash metal's glory days, and the guitar work follows suit. King and Hanneman treat us with the usual shredding approach with whammy-bar torture to simulate the screams of the victims the song is written about. The only complaint I have here is that King recorded all the rhythm guitar tracks for this album by himself. He is definitely one of metal's finer rhythm players, however it does mildly affect the general aura of the album since one of the things I liked the most in Slayer was the human factor- 4 otherwise normal guys creating blasphemous cacophony each on their own instrument, without the use of any recording tricks. This is, however, only a minor setback.\n\nNow, a major complaint here is the songwriting. Songs like Cult, Flesh Storm, Supremist (Which even contains a blast beat) are good, I would even go so far as to name Flesh Storm thrash anthem of the year. However, numbers like Eyes of the Insane and various riffs/sections of the album lack energy and could perhaps use some more work. Another downside would be the lyrics. Slayer is not to be taken seriously, which I think is pretty obvious by now, however some of the lyrics are just a bit too juvenile. The lyrics to Flesh Storm are pretty good and it's easy to discern the meaning, which can't exactly be said about the majority of the album's tracks, though. It could just be me, however I can't seem to pinpoint what the lyrics to, say, Black Serenade are about. Reborn? Rising up from the grave with vengeance. Necrophiliac? Desecrating a corpse. Criminally Insane? A homicidal maniac on the loose. Slayer have seldom penned very serious, thought-provoking, deep lyrics, but at least you'd know what they were trying to say.\n\nAll in all, Slayer's Christ Illusion is not a bad album, however it is also not without its setbacks. It does signal the band's definite return to thrash metal, and it does show Slayer's typical brand of aggression we've all grown to love. Christ Illusion will be remembered as one of Slayer's finer moments of the 21st century, however it probably does not have the material necessary for a modern classic. I also understand that it's popular to bash Slayer these days, but let's face it: They're still going strong after more than two decades of pounding extreme metal. Let's see the detractors do that.\n",
        "\nHaving decided to travel to Warsaw, Poland, to be at the inaugural \u2018Big 4\u2019 event I was eagerly anticipating the release of this boxset, not least because as a vertically challenged individual I was able to see very little from my position 300 yards back at Bemowo Airport on that historic day in mid-2010.\n\nThis release, the deluxe boxset which includes CD and DVD recordings of all four bands, would enable me to watch the show in Sofia in sharp detail which I had no hope of when in a crowd of near 100,000 in Warsaw.\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t disappoint. The item itself is nicely put together, although I would have been happy to pay \u00a320 ($31) for the CDs and DVDs without the poster, guitar pick, photos, booklet etc for which I ended up paying \u00a345 ($70). Sturdy, well made and a good piece of metal memorabilia.\n\nBut what about the performances? Well first up is Anthrax, the band which, arguably, held onto their spot in the Big 4 by the skin of their teeth throughout the mid-80s. Some would argue for Exodus, though on the strength of five great albums from 1985 to 1990 I would have chosen Kreator but then a European band would never make the Big 4!\n\nAnthrax\u2019s rough and ready debut, Fistful Of Metal lead on to two great albums \u2013 the ground breaking Spreading The Disease, and the hyperspeed/mosh orgy of Among The Living. These were the albums that Anthrax secured their place in the Big 4 with. Of course, they released two more well respected, if not particularly well received, albums after these. So this leads to a fundamental question \u2013 why, in a set of ten songs, do Anthrax choose to play two covers - Joe Jackson\u2019s \u2018Got The Time\u2019 and Trust\u2019s \u2018Antisocial\u2019? Plus a shortened cover of \u2018Heaven and Hell\u2019 by the band of the same name?\n\nWhile Anthrax are fun to watch onstage and put in a good performance musically and physically (including Joey Belladonna\u2019s strained vocals) to play two full covers in a ten song set is unforgiveable when tracks like \u2018Among The Living\u2019 and \u2018Gung Ho\u2019 were overlooked. Add to this the addition of \u2018Only\u2019, a song from an era of Anthrax that most grunge fans will enjoy and most thrash fans cringe at, and \u2018Medusa\u2019, one of the weakest, most commercial tracks from Spreading... and you have the makings of a poor set.\n\nAnthrax\u2019s enthusiasm cannot be questioned here, but their set list raises big questions for me as to whether they really understood the significance of this occasion.\n\nNext up \u2013 Megadeth. Put simply, on this performance and that in Poland, Megadeth are THE band to see at the moment. Very, very well produced sound, maybe the best sound I have ever heard on a live recording. Incredible musicianship. Mustaine and Broderick are tight as fuck on guitar duty; Newly, and rightfully, reinstated Dave Ellefson is excellent on bass guitar with his tight picked rhythms nicely high in the mix. Shawn Drover\u2019s drumming is flawless, and while you won\u2019t hear Nick Menza\u2019s powerhouse beats or Gar Samuelson\u2019s (RIP) syncopated jazz-influenced flamboyancy, what you do get is a totally heavy bass-drum driven barrage.\n\nThe set is just what was needed after Anthrax\u2019s weak start \u2013 opener \u2018Holy Wars...\u2019 giving way to \u2018Hangar 18\u2019, followed by \u2018Peace Sells...\u2019. After that comes nine more great songs, including a rousing rendition of \u2018A Tout le Monde\u2019. Absolutely fucking brilliant performance from a great band.\n\nSo how do you follow that? One word. Slayer.\n\nShould Slayer have played after Megadeth? It\u2019s arguable. On album performance over the last 27 years, yes. On their respective performances on the night, no, Megadeth ruled. But Slayer is Slayer. What you see is what you get. If, like me, Slayer is your favourite band ever and you have seen Slayer play on any number of occasions (last count maybe 15 times) then you know what you\u2019re in for, and this was no different. Pure fucking heads down aggression from start to finish.\n\nSlayer regularly mix their set up show by show and this one, sadly, contained nothing from Show No Mercy or Hell Awaits. However, \u2018War Ensemble\u2019, \u2018Hate Worldwide\u2019, \u2018Chemical Warfare\u2019 and the obligatory \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 will surely have given many of the newbie Metallica kids a headache.\n\nAs always, Hanneman and King are solid but raw and somewhat sloppy. The sound and mix are unforgiving on this recording for the guitar duo. Tom\u2019s vocals are good but still show signs of inexorable decline. On a couple of occasions he misses lyrics having invited the crowd to sing them. James Hetfield can do this in an arena this size, Tom can\u2019t, the response isn\u2019t loud enough. If you\u2019re watching the DVD it is apparent why there\u2019s no vocals but if you\u2019re listening to the CD then it sounds a little lame.\n\nThe stand out performance with Slayer is Dave Lombardo. He is superb, an absolute wall of unrelenting aggression played from the heart and with absolute conviction. For a 45 year old man this is utterly awesome.\n\nSo with Slayer bowing out with a brutal \u2018Raining Blood\u2019 the crowd eagerly awaits the main event \u2013 Metallica.\n\nOk, Metallica shows have been reviewed a million times, and by far more accomplished writers than me, so I am not going to give the typical critique, but I will give some observations.\n\nFirstly the set. Really good mix of old and new. They kick off with the all-time classic \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 which is followed by \u2018For Whom The Bell Tolls\u2019. After these come tracks from every Metallica album except Load and St Anger.\n\nAnd Metallica kick ass. As usual. They put on a great show with great crowd interaction, great visuals, great songs, just... great. But for me there\u2019s one thing which means I cannot listen to this show \u2013 Lars Ulrich.\n\nFrom the very start with \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 Lars lets the side down. Ulrich hasn\u2019t used a ride cymbal for over 20 years. He has a 5-piece drum kit. He simply cannot provide the percussion which a band of Metallica\u2019s standard and stature needs. His drumming makes a mockery of it all. That may sound harsh, but as a drummer I know what is required and he cannot provide it.\n\nHis drumming on \u2018Creeping Death\u2019 is horrible. He can\u2019t play tom rolls \u2013 he doesn\u2019t have the toms. His playing is too fast, too frantic. Metallica sound so lightweight, even on their heavier tracks, that I have to switch off. I will stick to recordings I have from the early- and mid-80s. This is Metallica \u2018lite\u2019, and while I think they do put on a great show, they are in danger of becoming an exhibition band.\n\nListen to Megadeth and Shawn Drover, and Slayer and Dave Lombardo, then listen to Lars Ulrich. Sorry Lars but....\n\nSo, the Big 4 Sofia boxset \u2013 a superb memento of a great event. Megadeth win this one hands down. In fact hands anywhere. They rule this show and they ruled the tour. If you can get your hands on this limited edition version then do, it is well worth it. \n\nIf not then seek out the DVD only version \u2013 you can still annoy your neighbours, just turn your TV the fuck up.\n\n(Originally reviewed for www.braingell.com)\n",
        "\nFor saying that i am a huge Slayer fan, and therefore should not really have a favourite single they have released, this one comes mighty close. This song may as well be progressive metal-listen to the intro compared to the finish.\n\nThe bass to this song is fantastic. Tom Araya is a near perfect bassist, and this song just shows it. His vocal performance is one of his best, from the slow, haunting singing in the first half of the song to the hundred miles per hour spitting towards the end.\n\nThe guitar duo, Kerry King and Jeff, are absolutely spectacular on this song, not wasting time on tuneless solo, but focussing on the riffing, which is what matters.\n\nThe drumming is by far Dave Lombardo's finest hour. This drum piece is spectacular.\n\nOverall, this is a single that should not be missed out on. I recommend it to everybody, as it progresses incredibly from slow sections to the heavy section at the end.\n",
        "\nIt has been often pointed out that Slayer\u2019s famed \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d EP, which many also believe eclipsed their monumental debut \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d, showcases one of the earliest examples of true, post-NWOBHM thrash. When taking note of the much darker overall sound aesthetic, the murky and almost doom-like guitar tone, and the much rawer vocal display out of Araya, there is definitely more of a commonality with what would be solidified as mid-80s thrash when accounting for the likes of Dark Angel and other similarly more aggressive acts that were more interested in horrific imagery than politics or social commentary. However, what is often missed on this is the strong proto-death metal aesthetic, which most tend to associate more with \u201cReign In Blood\u201d.\n\nAt the beginning of things, it is laid plainly before all in attendance that Slayer is in uncharted waters for this era. \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d, long heralded as a classic out of this band\u2019s youth, is one wicked riff monster with enough morbid fury to give Venom pause. The rapid paced muddy guitars set a tone that is easily associated with such early death metal offerings as \u201cSeven Churches\u201d, \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d, \u201cAltars Of Madness\u201d, \u201cSlowly We Rot\u201d and yes even \u201cEaten Back To Life\u201d. The only real disconnect here is that Araya has not abandoned a tonal form of vocals for the utter harshness exemplified by Schuldiner or Becerra, let alone the barely intelligible guttural barks of later bands. But what really makes this song stand out is its long length and effective use of a steady (albeit blinding) pace, presenting what could be considered a proto-type of the high form of death/thrash associated with the early works of all the aforementioned bands.\n\nThe remaining contents on here are each auspicious in their own way, but a little less astounding. \u201cCaptor Of Sin\u201d is a little bit slower, but still very murky, chock full of dissonant chromatic riffs that hint at a proto-death sound, and really lays on the lead guitar assault. The shred sections are actually the one area where Slayer still seems to have a remnant of their NWOBHM influences, consisting largely of the same pentatonic clich\u00e9s as heard on \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d, but loaded up a bit more with frantic whammy noise. The title song \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d actually offers a preview of the format that would be fully realized on \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, offering up a versatile mix of moderately fast and hyper fast mayhem with a very methodical riffing approach. But most of all, the atmosphere just oozes with intensity, to the point that even by today\u2019s standards it would be considered too much for many to handle. The 1993 version contains a bonus track from the band\u2019s earlier speed sound, which is quite good and actually heavily reminiscent of Metallica\u2018s \u201cHit The Lights\u201c, but obviously a bit out of place, particularly considering all the banshee screeches Araya keeps belting out through out the riff breaks.\n\nThe historical importance of this album is definitely something that should be clear to anyone who loves the style, but more important than that is that after 27 years of being available for mass consumption, this has lost none of its charm. This is the sort of album that actually transfers the mind of the listener back to \u201884 and subjects him to the same astonishment as felt by those who had the good fortune to grab this at its release. Break out your 6 strings and your amps, real or made of air, and prepare for the real war to end all wars.\n",
        "\nMuch has been said down the years about the scales that metal, and in particular thrash, rose to but there has been little in the name of collective footage to actually bring to life this fact for all to see. Until now. \"The Big Four: Live From Sofia, Bulgaria\" does exactly what it says on the tin and it does it so well I can hereby classify it as an essential purchase for anyone who a) likes any combination of Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth or Anthrax, b) is curious to see why these bands got so popular and c) like to have quality metal DVDs to stick on at a party. Clocking it at around 6 hours in total the Big Four play more bonafide classics in one performance than is likely to ever be caught on such a release and with a great 45 minute behind-the-scenes documentary capturing the thoughts of the band members on this celebratory occasion last summer it is not lacking in punches to entice the parting of you and your money.\n\nBill-openers for surely the first time in some years, Anthrax plough through the classics their early albums possess in number - \"Caught In A Mosh\", \"I Am The Law\", \"Madhouse\" and \"Antisocial\" among others - with decent, if fairly under-stated, gusto. If you would ask me Testament better deserve to have Anthrax's place in this hallowed club on both past and recent merits, a theory which holds water when looking at the current standards of the bands. Setting a precedence for which Megadeth and Slayer were soon to follow, the vocals of Joey Belladonna lack much of the prowess his 80's wailing held while the quality of Anthrax's 'recent' (8 years and counting now since a studio release) output is upheld by the appearance of just two songs post-1988 included in their 'best of' set (and one, \"Got The Time\" is a cover). To say Anthrax have been treading water for sometime would serve as a major understatement. However as an opening act their stage performance has been honed incalculably over the years to set the mood adequately for the bigger and better acts that were hot on their heels on a balmy summer\u2019s evening in Bulgaria.\n\nAfter years of public and no doubt private squabbles to see Dave Mustaine sharing a stage with his erstwhile Metallica colleagues must register as a very good day in the history of metal. Unfortunately the weather gods decided otherwise as Megadeth's set in Sofia was somewhat tempered the thunderstorm which blew almost from the moment they hit to the stage to leaving it an hour later. As the strongest candidate for best musician across the four bands Mustaine needs no introduction and his honour is held in the timeless quality of those five songs: \"Holy Wars\", \"Hangar 18\", \"Sweating Bullets\", \"Symphony Of Destruction\" and \"Peace Sells\". Utterly superb. With Dave Ellefson now back as a full-time member and rock solid accompaniment from Chris Broderick and Shawn Drover this is as strong a line-up seen in Megadeth for some years and is recognised in the quality reproduction of all 12 songs played. Whether due to sound problems or general decline with age Mustaine's vocals unfortunately feel weak at times across the set while the rain does it's best to dampen the spirited throngs before them but more is required to hold back a band like Megadeth, whose recent resurgence cannot have gone unnoticed by many.\n\nEasily the act who stuck closest to their guns through the 90's wilderness years Slayer remain, and forever will do, a religion to many of their devoted fans; a religion however that is beginning to look as flaky as some of those absconded in these legends lyrical past. With Tom Araya's vocals lacking all the menace of their classic period and a back injury preventing headbanging or any serious movement from him, Jeff Hanneman apparently adhering to the American cheeseburger diet and his and Kerry King's soloing sounding amateur when in competition with Mustaine, Broderick and Hammett, Slayer have, to these jaded ears, lost so much of what defined their untouchable brilliance of the 80s as to be heavily reliant on the continued brilliance of Dave Lombardo behind the kit. No doubt first-time listeners will continue to be blown away by the destructive power of \"Angel Of Death\", \"Reign In Blood\" et al as I was 10 years ago but having seen it all live many a time from a leaner, fitter Slayer it's hard to subscribe to the devotion many others seem intent on showing. Without having had to stand all day however to catch the multiple classics that a Slayer show is rammed full of their current status is better served as home viewing for this particular set of veterans show why they were only the second biggest band to emerge from the thrash scene\u2026\n\nHowever there can only be one winner in this contest and whom that is can leave no doubt. Metallica are, with good reason if \"The Big Four\" is anything to go by, one of the biggest live draws in all of music today and such a set as played here explains why - even before considering the 'Big Four Jam' cover of Diamond Head's classic \"Am I Evil?\". Spreading their setlist right across their classic first five albums with a small handful from 2008's return to form \"Death Magnetic\" highlights emerge from all songs, notably in my personal favourite \"One\" with its accompanying firework and pryo explosions setting the tone for that grimmest of lyrical subjects. Utilising every inch of the stage to it's full potential messrs. Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett and Trujillo give their typical studious best through classic after classic until the Big Four big event happens: a multi-band jam of \"Am I Evil?\" that resonates through the ages \u2013 cult NWoBHM classic transported to a modern-day stadium anthem, with passion throughout. Needless to say the crowd reaction is enthralling and if any further confirmation was needed, a glorious celebration of the power, and history, of these four bands and with it, heavy metal. A celebratory peak of a great genre as it now reaches into its fourth decade of existence: a true story of gritty perseverance getting it\u2019s just deserves.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nSlayer's sophomore Hell Awaits holds a number of memories for me, both chilling and comic, because it was one of those rare albums that experienced a sort of 'urban legend' cult status in my middle school years. Several peers and I once passed a cassette recording of both this and Show No Mercy around to one another, terrified of its contents, perhaps clinging to those vestigial traces of Christian upbringing. Copies were confiscated by teachers and parents, and a few of us got a good 'talking to', myself in particular, for spreading the twisted diocese of Satan through the rank and file of the innocent.\n\nKeep in mind that I was about 11-12 years old at this time, the target of crass, ignorant exaggerations by a Protestant flock, and by no means in thrall of the Prince of Hell. But the damage was done. I bought the actual cassette. My parents took it away. I stole it back. The top of the refrigerator was hardly a sufficient hiding place for my 'unapproved' stock of metal albums. They gave up. I bought the back patch, and was so armored the very day I parted ways from the Protestant faith (after being forced up through Confirmation prep class as an obligation). What an ironic portrait, a dorky pre-teen armed in denim and devils, striding proudly through a dull spring rain in 1986, having quit Church forever, wearing this image and title on my back. The prescient, magic 8-ball might read that my outlook was not so good.\n\nAlas, our figures of social authority had one thing right: Hell Awaits was one scary fucking record, especially when unleashed upon an audience whose idea of extreme was Dee Snider wearing blush and mascara. Granted, we had Welcome to Hell and Number of the Beast floating around by this time, but Slayer took this concept to an entirely new plateau, not only because of the lyrical content, but the cruelty of the riffs here that jettisoned the simplistic, scathing roots of Show No Mercy into an even sharper blade of menace and perdition. The songs were longer, more fleshed out, more 'mature', yet the blinding speed remained: Hanneman and King a pair of unstoppable ghouls cycling through a rogues gallery of bloodstained, fire-hardened riffs that would cement their stature as gods of diabolic thrash; Araya settling more into his distinct mid range, with nary a shriek to be experienced in most of the vocal passages; Lombardo breeding an entire new school of drummers that would follow his extremity into darker, restless climes.\n\nWhat better a herald to the fiery paths than a bath of feedback and cacodaemons exclaiming 'Join us' in reverse? Such is the de-Christening of \"Hell Awaits\" itself, the gallant vanguard that slowly and steadily escalated its warlike veneer into plodding, dire thrash, with that legendary ascent from conflagration at around 2:20. You are now at war, children, and Satan is your general. Let him ride upon your backs and piss upon the clouds of the Holy Host. But as charming a setup as this is, nothing, and I mean nothing can prepare one for the voracious evil that is \"Kill Again\", one of my personal favorite Slayer tracks, the perfunctory serial killer anthem that had to be one of the most bitter and extreme metal tunes I had heard for its day, once more incorporating Lombardo's warlike percussion into a salvo of beautifully belligerent riffs that seem to incite violence with their very notation, the chorus an unforgettably babbled hymn to atrocity:\n\n'No apparent motive, just kill and kill again\nSurvive my brutal thrashing, I'll hunt you till the end\nMy life's a constant battle, the rage of many men, homicidal maniac!'\n\nSo how do you follow up a celebration of murder? How about with some fucking vampires? \"At Dawn They Sleep\" opens with a horrific bristling spike of carnal melody before it transforms into another of the band's undying, gibbering chorus sequences that seems to mock the listener through its cacophonous glee. These three tracks alone would place Hell Awaits fork and horns above most thrash/speed metal histories, but Slayer were not finished with us yet, launching into the barbaric \"Praise of Death\" which serves as a sinister foreshadowing to the rampant, uncaring speed of their following masterpiece Reign in Blood. \"Necrophiliac\" is one of the best known songs from this album for a reason, it's rapid fire perversity transforming a sadistic and 'immoral' fetish into an act of glory worthy of any crude Colosseum, the crowd of sinners turning their thumbs proudly to herald the fused fornication of the living and the dead.\n\nBeyond this festering folly, we are led to what I might argue is the most unsung anti-hero of this record, \"Crypts of Eternity\", which opens with about a minutes of blistering, spiny necromantic guitars before it rolls into the verse and chorus, and an amazingly despotic bridge section that once more teases at what Slayer will produce in the following year, a turbulent breakdown festooned in a blaze of percussive exorcism. Lastly comes \"Hardening of the Arteries\", one of the album's faster pieces that strikes like a scourge or cat o' nine tails along the bared skin of the penitent with its apocalyptic poetics. While it certainly belongs here among this wretched flock, it is perhaps the one song here I don't think is perfect: for all the accoutrement of anguish created in the warlike, hammering finale, I found myself mildly disinterested.\n\nSlayer's sophomore was not only proof of the band's persistence, that they were no one trick pony with the masterful Show No Mercy, but it also remains one of the band's nearest flirtations with perfection, surpassed only by its closest brethren in bedlam. The album is not so fixed and fluid as its untarnished successor, but it's nearly as bewitching in the consistency of themes and the composition. There is nothing clean or polished about Hell Awaits, no salvation at the end of its corridor of sinful flesh, and it's a worthy archetype for some of the most demented extreme metal to have been produced since, an absolute necessity for any fan of speed, thrash, black or death metal that values the cautionary discomfort of unbridled anger and passion.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSlayer\u2019s Reign in Blood is one of thrash metals best selling records, which goes to show that popularity isn\u2019t everything. Back in 1986 this album was one of the fastest and heaviest thrash albums around, and helped define the genre, in a bad way. Slayer\u2019s Reign in Blood makes thrash metal look like it is played by a bunch of no talent losers who only care about how brutal the music is and not how it sounds. \n\nThe album starts out promising with Angel Of Death. The song has a lot of great moments, until the solo which is the typical Slayer picking really fast on a bunch of notes in no particular scale guitar solo. Other than, a terrible solo and some very average vocals by Tom Araya the song is pretty good and a cut above what is to come for eight more songs. The next eight songs aren\u2019t memorable at all, there is barely a riffs in the entire group of these eight songs that isn\u2019t either extremely mundane or just really fast palm mutes. Every solo, almost every riff, and every line of lyrics yelled monotone by Tom Araya gives someone who isn\u2019t very into metal the wrong idea of what its all about. Metal is in fact usually very sophisticated and takes a lot of talent to play but albums like this make it seem like all you need to be a famous thrash metal musician is a fast right hand. The album sort of makes up for this streak of below average songs with Raining Blood, which still sounds like a bunch of speed with almost no actual riffs but it\u2019s still pretty cool.\n\nOne good thing about the album is that it is short. If you decide to torture yourself with this album it will at least be a short torture. Most of the songs are under three minutes, which proves once again that Slayer are not good song writers and rely completely on how fast they can move their picking hands.\n\nAnother thing about Slayer\u2019s song writing is they do not like melody. The whole album sound extremely chaotic and to people who aren\u2019t used to metal music probably sounds like a bunch of random notes played with a lot of distortion, which is kind of what it actually is. You won\u2019t find a touch of melody on the entire album.\n\nAlthough I don\u2019t like this album at all I can\u2019t deny its influence. With this album Slayer inspired hundreds of other thrash bands to follow in their footsteps and write really fast and heavy thrash metal records, but is that really a good thing? This album may have inspired a lot of people to play thrash metal but all it really did was water the genre down from great riffing songs and fantastic shredding solos, to speed speed and more speed. This album made it ok to be a below average musician and song writer and play thrash metal. \n\nSlayers Reign in Blood is a great record if you are looking for speed, but other than speed it has absolutely nothing. The riffs are boring, the solos are terrible, Tom Araya is an awful vocalist, I use the word vocalist because while he does the vocals he is not at all a singer, and the album as a whole is unmemorable. On this album, Slayer manages to write two decent songs and eight terrible filler songs that can barely be called songs at all. This album is a below average thrash album that almost every mediocre high school garage band is capable of writing. Other than some fast palm muting and a good drummer, the band has zero talent, or if they do have talent they sure don\u2019t show it on this album or any other they\u2019ve released.\n",
        "\nSlayer\u2019s early material is almost universally praised by metal fans worldwide. You will hardly ever see someone bash \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d, \u201cHaunting the Chapel\u201d, or \u201cHell Awaits\u201d. Some might say that every Slayer album sounds alike, however those who have listened to their discography know that this is not the case. When Slayer released \u201cDiablous in Musica\u201d in 1998, many fans were disappointed by the new direction Slayer took with their music. Many felt it was \u201cmallcore\u201d and when \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d was released, these feelings continued. I agree with most fans that those two albums were weak and uninspired albums with only a couple of strong moments. In 2006 the band released \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d which returned some elements of the early days; however some felt that they still did not harness their full potential. In the year 2009, a new album by Slayer entitled \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d was released. Did this album bring Slayer back to their glory days? The answer is very simple; yes. \n\nSlayer, over 25 years later, has created a very good record that has many moments which will remind listeners of their early material. There are some weak moments on this album with \u201cAmericon\u201d and \u201cHuman Strain\u201d. \u201cAmericon\u201d might just be one of the worst songs Slayer has released, and easily contains their worst lyrics ever. However aside from those two tracks, this album is very well written. The album kicks off with the title track, with a thrash break that will remind some of \u201cAngel of Death\u201d or \u201cEpidemic\u201d. Immediately one will wonder if Slayer has pulled together. \u201cBeauty Through Order\u201d sounds like it could have been a track on South of Heaven, while \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d (which is possibly the best song they have done since \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d.), \u201cPublic Display Of Dismemberment\u201d, and \u201cUnit 731\u201d could have fit on \u201cReign in Blood\u201d. Slayer also made a very unique song with \u201cPlaying With Dolls\u201d which has a very distinct song structure and a very eerie feeling. By the end of \"Not of this God\" one should feel proud to be a Slayer fan again.\n\nThis album really shows the return of Slayer. Crushing riffs are found all throughout this album, as they are found in most of Slayer\u2019s albums. Jeff Hanneman has always been a better song writer than Kerry King, and it is shown once again on this album. However even the King songs on this album are entertaining as seen in \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d and \u201cPublic Display Of Dismemberment\u201d. Hell, even the solos on this album, which have been Slayer\u2019s weak point since \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, are decent. Tom Araya\u2019s vocal performance stands out as he sounds very angry here, however, he sings on \u201cPlaying With Dolls\u201d which gives a twist to that track. And as always, Dave Lombardo provides intense drum beats that show us once again why he is considered one of the greatest metal drummers of all time. Some may complain about the production of this album, however if you are a fan of \u201cHell Awaits\u201d or black metal, then the production on this album should not disturb you. \n\nSlayer is back. This is definitely a thrash album. The only traces of \u201cnu metal\u201d are found in the two weak tracks mentioned above. However, do not listen to this record expecting to hear something such as \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d or \u201cHell Awaits\u201d. If you want to compare the sound of this album their previous albums, it is like a mix of \u201cReign in Blood\u201d, \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d, and \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d. This is easily the best album they have put out since \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d. And to compare this album to the other recent material of the \u201cBig 4 of thrash metal\u201d, this album is much better than Metallica\u2019s \u201cDeath Magnetic\u201d and about on par with Megadeth\u2019s \u201cEndgame\u201d. But Slayer has granted us with some great thrashers on this record along with some unique tracks. Who knows what is in store for the future of Slayer. This could be their last album, this might not. However one thing that is for sure is that this is a fantastic record for an aging Slayer. If you are a fan of Slayer, you will be very proud of them for making a record like this. This is Slayer, and they have returned. \n\nHighlights: \u201cPlaying With Dolls\u201d, \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d, \u201cPublic Display Of Dismemberment\u201d\n",
        "\n\"I hate the shitty economy, it might as well be sodomy\".\n\nSo speaks the once-mighty Slayer. I've turned that particular gem of a lyric around in my head whilst preparing this review, and let me tell you it describes this awful album to a T. \n\nSlayer was once legendary. Tales of insane concerts at Chicago's Aragon Brawlroom during the 80s filled my ears prior to attending my first Slayer show, the \"Seasons in the Abyss\" tour. The floor was set up with folding chairs all linked together, and miraculously (or not) the chairs were still standing after Testament left the stage. Slayer appeared, 90% of the chairs hit the deck, and 5 distinct pits (at least) full of Slayer maniacs proceeded to whip themselves into frenzy. I'd never seen anything so wild in my life, and after the show I was told that it was very tame compared to the last two Brawlroom shows.\n\nThe reason I decided to post yet another review of this awful album is simple. I'm in the minority of MA users who enjoyed \"God Hates Us All\", and I can't bear to see that album ranked so much lower than this abomination called \"Christ Illusion\". To me, GHUA featured a convincingly pissed-off Tom Araya, solid production values, and intense music that drew me in from the first listen. It's not the greatest album Slayer ever put out (numerous riffs are questionable at best), but by God it destroys \"Christ Illusion\" in every possible way and shows me that Slayer is still capable of making good music even if this album is about as enjoyable as drinking bleach.\n\nThe lyrics and the vocal delivery for this album stink out loud. Forced rhymes, such as \"Tortured spirits / Will not let me rest\", sung as if the two lines rhyme with each other. The abysmally awful example at the top of this review, and you will excuse me if I don't type it again because I'm trying to wash it out of my head forever. Slayer once wrote songs which told stories; see any of their albums up to and including \"Divine Intervention\". Now, they go for cheap shock - \"I'll take the devil any day, hail Satan!\", or pointless profanity \"All that I fucking am!\" These lyrical abortions can be excused if they were delivered in a convincing manner or with a little passion, but here Araya's voice sounds so compressed and bored that I can't believe this recording made it off the mixing board. What were they thinking? Then we have incredibly annoying sing-song patterns like during \"Skeleton Christ\". This album contains some of the most disingenuous, dumb, fake, insulting lyrical themes I've ever heard, and Slayer does themselves no favors by having every word come through crystal clear in the mix.\n\nAnother thing about the lyrical content: it is childish and tired \"Jesus sucks\" nonsense. Slayer seems all upset about Christianity, even though they continue to play large venues amidst all the persecution and compulsory religious Christians out there... or not. Slayer does not get a pass on their rabid anti-Christianity while adding an anti-Islamic song called \"Jihad\" on the same album. Clearly, they are aware that Islamic fundamentalists are a million times worse than Christian fundamentalists on their worst day, so therefore you can take your anti-Christianity and stick it for the juvenile and fake shock gimmick that it is. You'd have been better off ignoring the Islamists altogether if you wanted to be consistent. I'm no member of any religion, but I won't give a group of 40+ year old millionaires a break when they clearly mean nothing they say and don't even bother to deliver their anti-religion messages in an entertaining way. Storytelling and effort gave us \"Reign in Blood\", incoherence and laziness gave us \"Christ Illusion\". \n\nThis album heralds the return of drum legend Dave Lombardo. Sorry Dave, but nobody missed you. Paul Bostaph was more than capable of taking your place and he did a hell of a job throughout. The drum sound on this album is restrained and compressed the same way the vocals are. The playing itself is excellent, but ultimately the drums are worse than the last album due to weak sound quality and production choices. \n\nThe guitar performance at least makes some sort of effort to produce better riffage than the last album, but they fail. Although the guitar tone and production is livelier than the drums and vocals, there are no memorable riffs on the entire album. GHUA had the title track, \"Christ Illusion\" has nothing. The solos are an shame, even by Slayer standards. The solo on \"Catalyst\" may be an all-time low among infamously bad Slayer solos, and the trade-off solos which appear on this album are so poor that there really is no excuse to call them \"solos\" after playing the guitar for 30 years. \n\nThe band members instrumentation sounds like they recorded their individual parts and emailed them to each other. There is very little blending of sound on this album, it all seems detached from each other, and there is no live feel to this record at all. \"God Hates Us All\", for all its flaws, had a wall-of-sound quality and everyone sounded like they were in the same room jamming together.\n\nIt took Slayer 5 years to create \"Christ illusion\", and it is an embarrassment for the band and their fans. My non-metal friend always makes fun of Slayer by grunting out made-up silly lyrics like \"kill your mother, kill your father, Christ is stupid\", and I've always defended Slayer ad being much more than that. I can no longer defend them, and I am honestly ashamed of myself for wasting my time listening to this, even for the purpose of a review. Slayer can reap the reward of selling their stuff at Hot Topic, but this will be the very last time I support this once-mighty band.\n",
        "\nSlayer is a band that has a long history with metal. They were one of the bands responsible for the birth of the extreme side of the genre and it is no doubt that they have influenced a countless number of bands, even some non metal ones. But any fan of the band, who isn't a fanboy or new to them, will admit to the fact that their quality has deteriorated over the years. From the nu metal acrobatics on Diabolus In Musica and God Hates Us All, and the unsuccessful 'comeback' of Christ Illusion, Slayer has proven that even the mightiest of metal bands once considered invincible can fall, and fall really hard. Getting to World Painted Blood, Kerry King compared this album to Seasons In The Abyss, because 'it has a little bit of everything'. Well, Seasons is a good album and even though it's not their best, an album like Seasons couldn't possibly further hurt the band's legacy, right?\n\nWell, there's a problem with Kerry King's analogy. It barely sounds anything like SITA. This album doesn't have much variety, if any at all. So perhaps, I should like it for what it is, a fun thrash album. Oh wait, it doesn't fit in that category either. I suppose I should get to the music, but I have a hard time deciding what I go for first as there is so much wrong with this album. \n\nThe guitar riffs. Well, I will not shy away from the fact that some of them are pretty catchy. But a lot of the times they are really bland, lack any kind of intensity and sound so half assed. They try to go for the classic 'evil' Slayer sound but instead end up sounding annoying and simple. Same can be said for the guitar melodies. The solos are insanely messy, and this wouldn't be such a bad thing if they weren't so damn directionless. The same type of solos worked well in Slayer's earlier days because thought was put in to the placement of the solos so they could be effective. Now, they just seem to throw in a random, structureless solo whenever and wherever they feel like it. \n\nAs for the vocals, Tom has really messed up his voice over the years. Even with the high budget production, I can tell something's off in his voice. But that aside, he seems to think screaming and ranting like an angry 13 year old boy sounds great. I remember a time when Tom utilized his voice for the best, using chanting, whispering, singing and screaming, all in a nice balanced state. Now, it's 90% screaming, a bit of nu metal talking, and mallcore-ish singing. He manages to keep the choruses and some other parts catchy, but not interesting. The lyrics are kind of dumb. From the annoying, repititive ranting of 'Murder is my future! Killing is my future!' in Snuff, to the infamous 'It's all about the motherfucking oil', the lyrics manage to bring the quality of this album down.\n\nDrums are probably the only good part about this album. Dave Lombardo provides energetic beats, fills and double bass parts. However, they are buried underneath at times due to the production. speaking of the production, it just seems really weird. I can't point what exactly is wrong but I can tell that the guitars aren't as effective as they should be and the bass is pretty difficult to hear most of the time. There are some pretty intense moments on the album but they are so less that I'm pretty sure that I can count the number of intense seconds on my fingers. One thing this album lacks and could really use is atmosphere, something they've completely avoided since Divine Intervention. Just another reason it doesn't sound anything like SITA. Some of the ideas presented on the album are interesting, like the structure of Playing With Dolls. But due to the terrible terrible execution, for example the wimpy intro riff and the dumb mallcore vocals, the potential of the idea is completely pissed on. The album is really monotonous for the most part, as it goes for a fast approach and tries to be Reign In Blood (which, I think is their worst album up to '94, but that's another topic altogether) but fails to even do that. \n\nWhat else can I say, this a very disappointing album. It's better than anything they've since after Divine Intervention, but that really isn't saying much. The nu metal bull is still present, up to lesser extent but pretty noticeable nevertheless. The vocals are terrible for the most part. The drums are good, but the guitars are ineffective. The bass is just.... there. Slayer has forgot what made them a great band once. But hell, why do they need to remember anyways? All the rabid fanboys and people new to Slayer who don't know any better have and are going to buy this album. What does Slayer have to lose? Other than their integrity and legacy I mean.\n",
        "\nI always listen to an album at least 10 times before I review it, but my future is apparent if I listen to this anymore. Makes me regret spending 10 bucks on it at Future Shop due to the constant recommendations by friends and thrashheads alike.\n\nI've always twitched a little when someone mentions most of the Big Four's work, with the exception of a few albums here and there. Seasons in the Abyss, ...And Justice For All, and Rust in Peace come to mind, just because I've never really liked any of it. This album causes me to dislike all of Slayer's aspects, drums, vocals, and riffs altogether. This being said, I'm still a diehard thrash metal fan who owns many other thrash icons' discographies (Kreator, Exodus, and Sodom, just to name some.)\n\nMost people (including Slayer themselves) have proclaimed \"World Painted Blood\" to be their new version of \"Seasons.\" Well, hogwash and poppycock I say to them! Seasons being one of the only Slayer albums I actually enjoy listening through from start to finish, I was actually insulted that the band themselves would compare this piece of mediocrity to that piece of superiority.\n\nThe riffs are tired, reused, and old, which isn't surprising because Slayer's riffs have always appeared somewhat repetitive and forced to me. King and Hanneman have both run out of creativity, which becomes even more apparent with the unoriginal drivel that they pour out in what they call \"solos.\" I don't call them solos, I call them boring. Guitarists should never have to exchange speed for creativity, but that's what they at least attempt to do\n\nDave Lombardo has always been my favourite part of the band, for me. He's been one of my favourite thrash metal drummers for quite some time due to his work on Angel of Death (only song off of Reign in Blood that caught my attention), and is one of the inspirations for me to become a drummer. That's why it extremely disappoints me to say that his performance on this album makes me wish he let Bostaph keep the job as drummer for this band, allowing him to explore new fields. I can't tell if Lombardo is purposely slower due to the inferiority of King/Hanneman, or if Tom Araya is no longer able to spit lyrics out like an auctioneer, or if he's just plain tired. In any case, his drumming is sloppy, it lacks any form of gusto it had back in the day, and he sure as hell didn't have any groundbreaking thrash revival drumming. The only track where he somewhat sparkled is Americon, which also happens to be the only track that I enjoyed on this album.\n\nI'm dividing Araya's section into two parts. His vocals are what they've always been, and are what's expected from a thrash metal band. He shouts. And shouts some more. And when you think he's done, he shouts. And then he screams and you can hear his voice crack, so he shouts some more. And then he tries to attempt clean vocals, which make you realize how much all this shouting affects someone's voice. Needless to say, his vocals have become strained, lack any form of aggression at all, and just make him sound like he's throwing a temper tantrum. Onto his bass, it's gone. You can't hear it all, except for a few seconds on the track Psychopathy Red. It's impossible to justly review a few seconds of audible bass, which is only audible because the guitars take a rest, especially when the reviewer isn't a bassist himself.\n\nNeedless to say, this album is so bad it makes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 look good. If you have an unnatural desire to flush money down the toilet, buy the album, and then send it down along with a few hundred dollar bills, because all you'll get with this is the same thing you've had for the last couple decades if you listen to Slayer: The exact same thing, with a nice set of manboobs.\n",
        "\nAs I re-import both of my Reign In Blood CD's (original and remaster) to my itunes for what seems like the 10th time, I decide to check out the Archives to see if anyone commented on the remastered version's bonus tracks, or maybe the remastered vs. original sound. To my utter fucking amazement, I see that the overall rating for this record is a pathetic 81%! Now that type of rating is appropriate for an overrated, mediocre but still classic work like British Steel, or a solid thrash comeback like Endgame, but come on! This is REIGN... IN... BLOOD! \n\nIt was enough to cause me to register for an MA account and write this review, my first on this site. Now, I don't think it's going to do any good to analyze the songs or rave about how it's only 28 minutes, or any of the normal shit people deservedly praise this record for on a regular basis. That said, yes, it IS my intention to help raise the score of this crucial record by giving it a 100. BUT, that also happens to be the score that I actually feel it deserves. This record and no others.\n\nHere's the thing: I don't believe that any two records can be exactly the same and hence deserve the same score. Now since there are obviously more than 100 metal records in existence, it's impossible to give every record a different score. But what IS possible is to assign a top rating. a 100 is THE highest rating. This score necessarily needs to be reserved for that ONE record in your collection that you believe is the BEST RECORD OF ALL TIME. A record that no others can top. To give out more than one 100 score means that you really aren't sure what you like best, and more than that, aren't really putting new records in context, because scores can change over time. I probably wouldn't have put Reign In Blood at #1 on release day in 1986. But over time, it's proven itself worthy...\n\nPoint being, acceptable candidates for the 100 slot would surely include the first 3 Sabbath records, Sad Wings, Painkiller, Puppets, Rust in Peace, Ace of Spades, Bonded By Blood, etc. And I wouldn't fault anyone for placing any of these records at 100. But in this reviewer's eyes, it is metal sacrilege to have Reign In Blood sitting on this glorious website at a paltry 81, and here's why:\n\nFor all the cries about the major label sellout, the big time producer and all that shit, has any band ever conformed LESS to what we typify as major label influence? Priest did pop covers at their label's request which then turned into pop metal originals, Maiden did Women In Uniform, Metallica went on MTV with a ballad, and Slayer did what, got faster and heavier?! yes! sure the songs got shorter, but they cut the fat, got straight to the point, and still didn't cut the solos out. And maybe that was Rubin's influence, but the difference is that is benefitted the songs and the album enormously. For the first time, a metal band took what was great about punk, the succinct and straightforward delivery, and actually used it to create a better heavy metal song. I love punk rock but there is nothing punk rock about the songs on Reign In Blood. They are out and out heavy metal songs played faster, with more precision, and with a more venomous but contradictorily clearer and organic delivery than had ever happened before or since. \n\nAnd let's talk about precision. Not the precision of pro-tooled digital autonomous bullshit that is all-consuming in our current time, but the precision of skilled musicians, skillfully recorded. Don't get me wrong, I love raw and I love early Slayer. There are some absolutely killer songs, but like early Kreator, Venom, Bathory, even Megadeth, they are muddy as hell. A cacophony of noise. And sometimes a cacophony of noise suits my mood just fine. But more often than not, a precision-guided metal attack destroys all comers. When it comes to Reign In Blood, the production suits the songs perfectly. Songs this fast, with double kick and rhythm guitar work this good, would simply come across as a sludgy mess with production any less clear than Rubin's (listen to the snare!). But in the process, he sacrifices absolutely none of the immediacy and brutal attack of the songs. They hit, and they hit hard. Crank this record up (especially the original master, with all dynamics fully intact) and you can hear every little nuance of every instrument, with drums and solos obviously at the forefront. And if repetition is truth, then I say again, clarity equals power. And that point is proven in an instant by comparing the Reign In Blood session outtake of Aggressive Perfector with the original Metal Massacre III version found on the Haunting the Chapel EP reissue.\n\nIt wasn't Hanneman & King's original, confrontational songs. It wasn't Araya's aggressive, brutal but still memorable vocals. It wasn't Lombardo's genre-defining double kick onslaught. It wasn't Rubin's heavy but crystal clear production. It was the perfect storm of all of all those elements, combined into one half-hour record, recorded in 1986, that ultimately constituted the greatest heavy metal record of all time. hands down. 100.\n",
        "\nSlayer\u2019s music became one of the bases for death metal, alongside Sepultura. The band has made fast thrash anthems like \u201cAngel of Death\u201d and \u201cRaining Blood\u201d which became a trademark for the band. After the disappointing release of \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d and three more years, we get \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d. Let\u2019s see what it sounds like\u2026\n\nRemember when Tom Araya said that this album will sound like \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d? Well, it does, but on the other hand, this album has a lot of edge. The songs are quite short, with an average length of three-and-a-half minutes. The songs also have more punk feel done Slayer-style (late Slayer, that is), with breakdowns included. Well all that\u2019s noticeable even for the untrained ears. A lot of things have changed like the riffs and the music, both of which sounding more hardcore than ever. But the big change here, really, is the vocal work. It\u2019s quite noticeable that Tom Araya is really getting old, but al the very least his voice doesn\u2019t seem to have dried up excessively. Most of all, what I\u2019ve really liked in this album are the solos. Yes, those dissonant yet musical solos that makes your head bang. It really screams \u201cKerry King\u201d out loud. The solos still are very original and inspired in every shape and form, which reminds me of their good old days.\n\nThe title track really is an excellent way to start the album. It has an eerie feeling, worthy of the Slayer name, though it doesn\u2019t have much speed. \u201cSnuff\u201d is another good song, with a hell lot of solos and a lot of sheer ferocity, minus the whiney ending. \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d, although quite repetitive and has a silly ending, has enough ferocity and speed. \u201cAmericon\u201d is one groovy song, though it seems out of place anywhere you put in the album. And lastly, \u201cNot of This God\u201d is my personal favorite here for being both eerie and fast, though it slows down in the middle.\n\nOne major problem about this album is that they focused too much on speed, though there they have three mid-tempo songs here. Listen to \u201cUnit 731\u201d. It might be fast but it\u2019s nothing special, really. Another thing is that the mid-tempo songs remind me of the Christ Illusion fillers. These guys could do better than that, just like what they did on \u201cSkeletons of Society\u201d and \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d. Both songs might not be fast, but they\u2019re wicked sick. Last thing is that they shouldn\u2019t recycle ideas to a lot of songs in a single album.\n\nThis is a good album that gets stale with every listen. Though still a pretty good snag, these guys should create something that will withstand the test of time. I hope they will create something better than this in their next release, but a very good improvement since their last album though!\n\nOriginally made for http://mystifymyserie.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nWhat better way to celebrate one of the most blood curdling debut albums in the history of metal than to follow it up with a fresh and devastating EP. Many Slayer fans may have had their first exposure to these tracks on the re-mastered edition of Live Undead, where they have conveniently been placed.\n\nThe material here is a natural extension of Show No Mercy, and some of the most focused songwriting of their career. \"Chemical Warfare\" remains one of the most cruel and vicious speed metal songs ever recorded, with its violent build up and then one of the most catchy and simplistic riffs ever devised. Araya's vocals are pure evil as they spit forth the lyrical equivalent of biological armageddon:\n\n'Gods of the throne must be watching from hell\nAwaiting the mass genocide\nSoldiers defeated by death from a smell\nBodies lie dormant no life'\n\n\"Captor of Sin\" begins with a rock out riff to a disgusting and messy lead (the Slayer trademark), then busts out a cruel thrash riff under the Satanic lyrics. \"Haunting the Chapel\" closes the original EP with a nice riff that almost foreshadows the style that would be come more prominent on Reign of Blood and South of Heaven. It reminds me a little of \"Die By The Sword\", as if I feel that chorus will break out at any moment. The lyrics to all the songs are good.\n\nIf you have the 1993 re-issue of this EP material, an extra song is included: \"Aggressive Perfector\", which originally appeared on the Metal Massacre 3 compilation. It's a groovy and evil track with a nice bass line to it, but not as strong as the original material on the EP. Again, it has some nice and sloppy solos in that tradition Hanneman/King style.\n\nHaunting the Chapel sounds very close to Show No Mercy as far as its overall tone, the material could very well have appeared on the full length album. Still, it's a damn good example of their early work, when the band was groundbreaking and sinister and well worth a damn.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a certain sweetness that comes with seeing a great band finally get back on the ball, but seeing 2 members of the good old Big 4 get their act together is quite a treat. In terms of overall faithfulness to the original tenants of Thrash, Slayer\u2019s \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d carries the day, though as an overall quality metal album \u201cEndgame\u201d edges it out. Both make definite references to the past, though Slayer\u2019s revisiting of the glory days of the genre is not quite as multifaceted. The band set themselves apart from other thrash outfits by focusing mostly on speed, aggression, creepy themes, brutal lyrics, and a chaotic atmosphere.\n\nFor the most part, this album tries extremely hard to be another \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, but ultimately comes out musically as a midpoint between \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d and \u201cSeasons In The Abyss\u201d, with a vocal performance that tends towards \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d. Suffice to say, Araya\u2019s vocals are completely depleted of any banshee wails, and concentrate on a morose, yet still tonal shout. It is less ridiculous than the slovenly hard core inspired vocal drivel on \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d, but still with a limited range and character that showcases the band\u2019s principle weakness since the mid 90s. \n\nThe production is really dry and plain, particularly the popping quality of the drums combined with an overloud cymbal presence, but solid riff work and riveting musicianship, particularly on the part of Hanneman and King, tend to mask this otherwise glaring flaw. A quick listen to wild leads such as heard on \u201cSnuff\u201d and \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d, the former of which contains leads so methodical that they could be hummed along to in spite of being all over the place, will solidify a high expectation of riveting greatness in the soloing department not witnessed since 1990. Sure, the atmosphere surrounding each crazy shred fest isn\u2019t as dense and haunting as on \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, but things are put together so well that you hardly notice.\n\nFor the most part, Slayer came full circle here in terms of songwriting and is now backing into the proto-death/thrash territory that they were flirting with in the mid 80s. A quick listen to selected riffs and sections on \u201cBeauty Through Order\u201d, \u201cPublic Display Of Dismemberment\u201d and \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d will reveal a familiar collection of creepy chromatic themes that were paraphrased by Deicide, elaborated on by Death, muddied up by Bolt Thrower, and exaggerated into tonal oblivion by Cannibal Corpse. Most of these songs are kept under the 3 minute cap, and differ from the acclaimed bands that were influenced by this one in the vocal approach and a somewhat less surreal and graphic lyrical depiction of human depravity.\n\nMuch like the band\u2019s most renowned release \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, most of the time these songs cook at varying rates of moshing insanity, and their most ambitious and memorable songs are the opener and the closer. Both of these songs generally incorporate the same driving, fast as hell combination of thrash beats and signature riffing heard in the shorter numbers, alongside a set of slower atmospheric sections, but taking the route of a more human testimony of the events depicted rather than the otherworldly nature of the 80s material. But unlike said album, there are a few slower songs on here with commonalities to various experiments like \u201cFragments Of What Used To Be\u201d and \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d, culminating in \u201cHuman Strain\u201d and \u201cPlaying With Dolls\u201d, both of which are decent but don\u2019t slay the senses like the rest of the album does.\n\nDisagreements will naturally be had amongst Slayer\u2019s fans over this album, largely because most associate the band\u2019s past greatness with the somewhat dense atmospheric aesthetic that their classic works was steeped in, which is not present here. But it is otherwise a nearly 100% faithful revisiting of that period musically, perhaps to the point of asserting its desire to have been released in 1992 rather than 2009. But at the end of the day, the important part of any album isn\u2019t the year it was copyrighted, but the contents contained therein. \n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 1, 2010.\n",
        "\nThis release was Slayer's 4th full-length studio effort. Though not as fast and speed oriented as their energized predecessor, \"Reign in Blood\", the songwriting still showed a different approach by the band. Their tracks focused more on a slower and more diverse riff structure to them. The lineup consisted, once again, with Tom Araya on bass/vocals, Kerry King on guitars, Jeff Hanneman on guitars and Dave Lombardo on drums. These were the first founding 4 members. This lineup seemed to work the best for the band. They all reflected a more mature writing strategy, which focused more on constructing solid songs minus the craziness that occured during the bulk of \"Reign in Blood.\" They slowed down to construct a solid, more mature release than on their previous 1980's releases.\n\nTheir genre still stays in the thrash metal category. That hasn't changed, only their musical focus was different. They seemed to show more catchy songs as opposed to a more blitzing array of riffs which were featured on their predecessor, \"Reign in Blood.\" Araya's vocal efforts were way less intense though there still were some screaming that he portrayed on the track, \"Live Undead.\" With \"Mandatory Suicide\" there were some spoken parts near the end of the song. This wasn't featured on any of their previous 1980's releases, only on this one. Araya focused more on belting out contents that were mixed well with the music and were easier to understand. However, he seemed to lack some intensity to his outputs. It meshed better, because as was previously mentioned, they wanted to create a better constructed musical approach with this release.\n\nThe music contained crunch tone guitar riffs that seemed to accompany Araya's vocals more fluently. Tempos varied to some extent but the guitars reflected a more mild form of Slayer than on previous efforts. The music was wholly original and noteworthy. Songs such as the title track, \"Silent Scream\", \"Live Undead\", \"Ghosts of War\" and \"Spill the Blood\" were very catchy. Despite slowing down so much, these tracks carry with them an array of intriguing components. They still focused on an underground sound, which displayed the album's concept. Slayer's technical side of the riff-writing was shown on \"Silent Scream\", \"Read Between The Lies\" and \"Spill the Blood.\" There was an actual clean tone introductary guitar piece during \"Spill the Blood\" which occurs towards the middle of the song. Something like that didn't accompany any of their past 1980's releases.\n\nThe production was solid and the mixing for each instrument came together well. Rick Rubin was, once again, involved on this end as well as the band. The playing, especially during the guitarists lead guitar works, were less technical than Hanneman's. If you look on the insert, it shows who the lead belonged to. This was mainly done because Hanneman didn't want the public to get confused and think that his leads were King's. He has stated this in previous interviews. Lombardo's drum efforts were phenomenal and was right on cue with the music. His playing was greatly conducted and quite technical. Not every track was entirely fast, however. Araya's bass guitar work was also right on top of the main rhythm guitar works.\n\nSong contents focused more on warfare despite the album title. They were really intelligent and well thought out. The songs shyed away from Satanism though they did contain some bits of anti-religion topics. They didn't form the bulk of writings. Though \"Behind the Crooked Cross\" steered away from warfare to reflect the downfall of religion. The bulk of their lyrical writings are a gimmick anyway. They're not professed Satanists. There is a cover song on here entitled \"Dissident Aggressor.\" It was originally sung by Judas Priest. Slayer executed this cover very well and it fit well with the album's concept.\n\nEven though Slayer's playing slowed down here, they still were able to concoct a solid and original form of writing to their songs. The music was quite memorable because of the unique guitar riff structures. They seem to get embedded easily into the listeners brain. The leads weren't as crazy as on \"Reign in Blood\" but that didn't take away from their wellness in execution. The band's overall playing demonstrated much talent. They focused on better conducted riff structures and time signatures much more so than with previous releases. This release was, by far, not stale or boring. A definite classic release by them which shouldn't be excluded in your Slayer discography. Worth picking up and it won't dissappoint.\n",
        "\nThere are those live albums which have gone into history. We never stop talking about Live After Death, Unleashed in the East or No Sleep 'til Hammersmith. I\u2019ve never heard anyone really bash or discard \u2018Decade of Aggression\u2019 yet for some reason this live album is often overlooked. I wonder if this had something to do with the chosen songs because it can\u2019t be because of the production nor performance.\n\nNo overdubs here. Yes, a few minor mistakes here and there which are to be expected playing live and when keeping up the pace as much as Slayer does here. But there are no real big mistakes, the band really plays strong. Especially songs from Show No Mercy turn out great here. Everything the original recordings, from my perspective, lacked in terms of production, is done right this time. The Antichrist and especially Black Magic sound better than ever. Now this is the true potential these songs actually had. \n\nWith 5 songs, half of the Reign In Blood album is well represented. But one could complain about the low amount of songs from Hell Awaits. Only the title track is on the regular Decade edition. Very poor indeed but the Haunting The Chapel songs \u2018Chemical Warfare\u2019 and \u2018Captor of Sin\u2019 do make up for it. Obviously there are a lot of songs from the Seasons album here since they were promoting it at that time. But 8? The special edition even has 9! That\u2019s just too much really. 5 would\u2019ve been just right, leaving out the somewhat lesser material like the slow paced \u2018Blood Red\u2019 and \u2018Expendable Youth\u2019 and replacing them with 'Silent Scream' and 'Ghosts of War' since I could really do with more aggressive versions of those. Or even replacing the song \u2018Seasons In The Abyss\u2019 because that one takes up around 7 minutes. Honestly, they could\u2019ve played \u2018Necrophiliac\u2019 and \u2018Hardening of the Arteries (without the intro-reprise)\u2019 here instead. Would\u2019ve made a lot of people happier I\u2019m sure.\n\nHowever Slayer do manage to make even the least interesting songs become part of this 90 minute thrash fest. When all are played with this intensity and equal production it often even becomes painful to realize how much aggression, which Slayer obviously do posses, was lost due to the production on some old Slayer albums with the exception of Reign In Blood. Take for instance \u2018At Dawn they Sleep\u2019 on the deluxe edition which completely shatters the original, I stress, in terms of energy and aggression. Or the earlier mentioned \u2018The Antichrist\u2019.\n\nNow I could go on how Araya isn\u2019t always as perfect as he was on previous regular studio releases but for a live recording he\u2019s holding up strong here considering the circumstances of being on tour and the necessary pace and energy throughout a thrash metal performance. And same could easily be said about the rest, including Lombardo. The songs here were taken from three performances in 1990 and 1991. And the sound of each song or performance fortunately doesn\u2019t differ that much from the other as for instance that horrible A Real Dead One album by Iron Maiden.\n\nAs just being a Slayer live album it is simply great. But when also even considering the time of its release and how other thrash metal live albums sounded, it is even close to perfect. Just remember how awfully produced Nuclear Assault's Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, Dark Angel's Live Scars\nAnd Death Angel's Fall From Grace were. They were superb bands when they recorded those albums but the production almost unbearable. For some reason the best thrash metal live recordings up till then were either VHS releases (Oidivnikufesin!), loose tracks or EP\u2019s (Testament, Sacred Reich and Forbidden at the Dynamo for instance) and this was the first complete live album which also sounded worthy.\n\nThe other three of the big four failed to release a live album at this time, the breaking point of thrash metal. Metallica\u2019s Binge and Purge box just came too late and incorporated too much nineties songs already (although the Seattle '89 video is truly great but should have been released\u2026in 1989 or 1990 already!) and Anthrax\u2019 Live The Island Years sounded hideous and also was released years overdue. And let\u2019s not start about Megadeth, who took 17 years from their debut to finally release a full length live album, probably due to Mustaine\u2019s brilliant vocals live.\n\nThus Decade Of Aggression can also be seen as a testament to the heydays of thrash metal. The Clash Of The Titans tour, the last explosion of thrash metal as one of the biggest metal scenes of the eighties before the nineties took over and the metal scene shattered into dozens of subgenres which still divide a lot of us to this day.\n",
        "\nSlayer's origin dates back to 1981 when the band was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Tom Araya then joined playing out the parts of bass and vocals. Dave Lombardo decided to join on drums soon thereafter. Their first release \"Show no Mercy\" was a great debut though it wasn't entirely flawless. But for a debut, it was good enough to convince fans to check them out as a thrash metal outfit. \"Hell Awaits\", their follow-up release wasn't as good as I expected it to be. People found it to be something that should not miss out on. It just wasn't striking to me. \"Reign in Blood\", their 3rd full-length album was probably their most solid output for the time. Some of the most brutal speed infected songs are featured here on this release. The album is completely no holds barred form of thrash metal played at it's finest.\n\nAs far as the guitar riffs go, they are wholly technical and innovative. Not only that, but they are played with such spell bounding energy. It's really incredible. No track on here is boring or a complete waste. I'm assuming that their main focus here was to achieve a high level of success as far as the songwriting goes. All of the song tempos are totally and astonishingly fast. It's really baffling to the listener. Pure crunch distortion for the guitars that hardly ever seem to let up. I'd consider \"Reign in Blood\" to be one of the best thrash metal releases in history. The reason that I make this assumption was because all of the songs were spell bounding in intensity. They are all original sounding. Nothing here is copied from anywhere else. Previous releases showed their potential and here on \"Reign in Blood\" is where they shined their most.\n\n\"Angel of Death\", their first song on here begins with a totally fast technical riff which gives the listener an idea of how the rest of the album will sound. It's one of the longest songs on here but is in no way lacking in originality. The tempos varied on every song though for the most part they were all very fast. The E-flat tuned guitars punch out some mind boggling riffs and other songs were in more brief moderate speeds. Musically speaking, Slayer demonstrates on here that they were not a force to be reckoned with. No real melodic songs are featured only pure deafening thrash metal. Really brutal and Araya's vocals mesh well together with the guitars. His outputs feature shrieking screams during some tracks and others that are way fast. A good example of the fast vocal output would be for the song \"Necrophobic.\"\n\nAside from the crunch festered guitars, the bass is somewhat audible and Lombardo's drum outputs were solid. He keeps up the pace for each song and so does Araya's bass guitar playing. Tracks that were also notable besides \"Angel of Death\" would be \"Piece by Piece\", \"Reborn\", \"Jesus Saves\" and \"Raining Blood.\" Slayer exonerates unique songwriting capabilities here as a 4-some band. They definitely matured as an uncompromising thrash metal band. Their previous 2 releases gave their audience potential as a band. \"Reign in Blood\" successfully fulfills that potential much more so then other thrash metal bands back in the 1980's.\n\nThe lead guitar pieces by Hanneman and King are way technical here. It's difficult to tell the difference between the 2 guitarists. The only way really is to view the insert that accompanies the CD. Though Hanneman said in the past that they show this so that people don't think that his solos are King's. They both show real talent however and the other band members are also very well versed. Araya's vocals/bass guitar playing is quite up to par with his fellow band mates. Lombardo definitely does a great job on drums keeping up in time with the guitar riffs. Probably their most technical release to date, \"Reign in Blood\" defines the way thrash metal should be played. That would be in a totally hardcore fashion. Production and mixing was really done well. Each instrument was blended together to form a strong and awesomely founded release. The rhythm/lead guitar, bass and drums were fit in together. This was what lacked from their previous 2 full-length albums. Rick Rubin did a great job here working alongside the band to enhance their studio efforts.\n\nLyrically speaking, Slayer's Satanic and anti-religion topics form the bulk of the songwriting. Their whole lyrical approach is a gimmick anyway. They aren't Satanists even though they chose for this release and prior 2 to talk of these topics. However, it blends well with the music. They wanted to keep that \"underground\" approach I suppose. Their previous albums also reflect this Satanic worship sort of style to their songs. They shouldn't throw the listener off because \"Reign in Blood\" is such a classic release from the band. Thrash metal isn't played much finer than this. The original album doesn't feature any cover songs here. It's good that they're entirely originals. This shows what talent the band has entirely.\n\nEven though this was Slayer's 3rd full-length album, it sure shows a lot of maturity from a musical standpoint. Other bands such as Exodus and early Metallica showed their talent as well though Slayer never decided to give up their thrash metal roots. With \"Reign in Blood\", we see them to be playing at their finest. Pure originality, brutality and uncompromising thrash metal. Very intense album. They didn't wish to cash in and put out something that would sell out like Metallica did. People that wish to hear uncompromising thrash metal that's totally original, pick up \"Reign in Blood.\" You won't be disappointed. It's a total personification of how thrash metal should be played.\n",
        "\nI was listening to Iron Maiden mostly when I bought a bunch of metal albums from some guy I went to school with. Hell Awaits was among them. I\u2019ll never forget how I kept staring out of my window after it was finished\u2026and played it again. This was evil, this was dirty, this was filthy. Damn, this was good! Over the years I\u2019ve lost count how many times I played or heard this album, hundreds of times? Maybe more? I know every scratch, every flaw (that funny mistake on Necrophiliac for instance). Hell I even really missed a few typical vinyl scratches when I finally bought a CD version and it actually pissed me off.\n\nBut what I always have felt about this album is that, save the title track, the album does not have that many individual classics when I compare it to their other records from the eighties. Hell Awaits was more of an entity on which no song could exist without the other. I\u2019ve always found Hell Awaits to be magical, typically characteristic and very influential but never my favourite Slayer album. I think it\u2019s because Reign In Blood also was a perfect entity but each and every song there could also live on it\u2019s own. However, if I just play \u2018Crypts of Eternity\u2019 in between songs from other albums, it\u2019s just not that enjoyable anymore.\n\nOver the years a schism slowly emerged. Four tracks against three. \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019, \u2018Kill Again\u2019, \u2018Necrophiliac\u2019 and \u2018Hardening of the Arteries\u2019 on one side, being my favourites, versus those other three. And I\u2019m actually starting to believe those remaining three song to be the main reason for me never considering Hell Awaits to come even close to Reign In Blood.\n\nPoint is \u2018At Dawn They Sleep\u2019, \u2019Praise of Death\u2019 and especially \u2018Crypts of Eternity\u2019 have a lot of dragging rubbish going on. Heavy metalish breaks and tedious long instrumental or dull slow bits. They\u2019re not Maiden nor Priest and they\u2019ve got enough identity of their own here already so I never got what the whole idea was behind these show-off fist banging mania sections. Did they actually try to incorporate more MercyfulFate-isms into their already great thrash metal, creating six and a half minute versions of songs which would have been perfect at 4 minutes without the excessive instrumentalism? \n\nIn the case of \u2018Crypts of Eternity\u2019 it\u2019s a real shame because the \u2018I Have Seen The Darkened Depths Of Hell\u2026etc\u2019 chorus is actually one of the best ones on the album. Had that whole 2:42 till 5:03 section been cut out, the song could\u2019ve been one of my favourite Slayer songs. But as I said before, when listening to these songs in between the others and considering them just part of the big Hell Awaits story, they make much more sense. These mixed feelings have been haunting my chapel since the eighties.\n\nAnother aspect regarding withstanding the test of time is the production. If I were to be honest the production is just too soft, or better said, the guitars aren\u2019t actually loud enough (the leads and solo\u2019s are though). There are other albums from 1985 with a more vile production. Productions which would have suited this Slayer material better. The guitars here sound like crumbling sand grains having a beach party instead of flame-ridden strings played by demons from hell.\n\nSo much for having my go at this the negative aspects of this album. If I think about the years of my life I have been carrying it around with me, playing it regularly and how influencial this specific album has been on the development of not only thrash but death metal and black metal as well, it\u2019s nothing less than a classic and extreme eighties entity. For instance analyse \u2018Necrophiliac\u2019 and dare to tell me you can\u2019t hear how even Sepultura wrote several variations on aspects from this specific song on their \u2018Morbid Visions\u2019 and \u2018Schizophrenia\u2019 albums. It would be the job of a lifetime naming all bands, albums, songs or even small sections which have directly been influenced by what Slayer did here on Hell Awaits.\n\nIf you listen to Hell Awaits as being that influential mid-eighties thrash metal album, there\u2019s no denying the brilliance of it and I wouldn\u2019t want to change anything about since I\u2019ve known it by heart for about 22 years now. Yet if you listen to it as being that album between Show No Mercy and Reign in Blood simple complaints emerge even if this album just crushes Show No Mercy. There are still some last few NWOBHM tendencies to be dealt with and the production and compositional efficiency are not yet fully developed here.\n\nHell Awaits is an already marvellous and important eighties release which i.m.o. could have even been better. Obviously a definite must have for anyone into thrash but even anyone into eighties metal.\n",
        "\nStarting with Christ Illusion I started buying Slayer stuff again for the first time since Divine Intervention. Hell, Slayer sound like Slayer again since 2006 for the first time in many, many years. Just like with all the thrash metal bands from the eighties I\u2019d be rather senile to expect or demand releases just as genius as their ancient masterpieces but it\u2019s damn good if they at least start thrashing again. So to be honest when such a band just releases a thrash metal album instead of those nineties-ridden nu-metal, poprock or groove attempts, I\u2019m happy. And this is exactly what Slayer has done, save a few dull tracks, for the second album in a row.\n\nWhat could be the complaint or discarding-argument of some people, the riffs (or even the entire approach of their faster material) sounding old fashioned or even rehashed, actually is a strong point in my humble opinion. Isn\u2019t this exactly what legions of fans cried for when Slayer went AWOL on Diabolus in Musica and God Hates Us All? Well, on World Painted Blood most Slayer riffs are Slayer riffs, it\u2019s their signature sound. Just listen to \u2018Psychopathy Red\u2019. This can\u2019t be anything but Slayer. And honestly, if this reminds you of something, it\u2019s Slayer themselves again and again. And if it reminds you of something else, it\u2019ll be a band that has been influenced by Slayer.\n\nAs said in my opening statement, there is enough real old school thrashing Slayer happening to make it a good album. There is a decent amount of fast tracks with catchy choruses and great riffs here which remind me of the days of Born On Fire and SexMurderArt. On this album \u2018Unit 731\u2019, \u2018Snuff\u2019, \u2018Hate Worldwide\u2019 and the earlier mentioned superb \u2018Psychopathy Red\u2019 are the best examples. There are enough of these tracks or sped up sections to make this yet another solid Slayer release. But are they just solid? Well \u2018Psychopathy Red\u2019 would have been a great tune on any Slayer album. \u2018Unit 731\u2019 and \u2018Snuff\u2019 are packed with more energy than you\u2019d expect after all these years from these aging guys and they have a more than obvious hint to crossover this time.\n\nBut this time the group also managed to write some good slower material again. I\u2019m not talking about \u2018Human Strain\u2019 (just dull and dragging) nor \u2018Americon\u2019 (which even sounds like groove-era Sepultura) but \u2018Playing With Dolls\u2019 apart from that annoying nineties-orientated guitar picking hovering over the song, is actually pretty good in essence. The basic riffs, vocal lines and build-up, are memorable. It\u2019s a matter of arrangements here. Had that higher pitched guitar on the verses and bridge here been replaced by an eerie melody, it could have become a good song in Seasons Of The Abyss tradition. Apart from that there are several tracks on which slower sections have been incorporated but the songs take all kinds of directions. For instance \u2018Beauty Through Order\u2019 is not that special but has an interesting atmosphere before it erupts at a point at which you actually didn\u2019t expect it coming anymore before settling into a classic midpaced Reign-South era middle section.\n\nSlayer does nothing new here. But neither do they disappoint and on one song they even exceed expectations. Only the guitar tone, rather flatly produced drums and the fact that the vocals have been mixed in too soft are highly debatable details. Yes I know, these are three quite important aspects. But there is more enjoyment than there are complaints as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n",
        "\nSLAYER\u2026the perfect name for one of metal\u2019s greatest acts. The name screams honor, necessity, and importance\u2026and it\u2019s the best thing to scream amidst a crowd of drunken, sweaty, fulfilled concert goers the world over. It\u2019s been many, many fantastic years since their introduction into an unsuspecting Bay Area, where, as time progressed, Satan, serial killers and warfare slit the throats of every rose having its thorn, Dr. Feelgood and disposable heroes, standing the test of time, even in the face of a country\u2019s popularity overhaul. And though many people have been pissed by consistent style changes (honestly, I liked \u201cDiabolus in Musica\u201d and \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d\u2026), their hard-nosed existence should be something to vilify, not shit on.\n\nAnd so we have \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d\u2026\n\nWell, I gotta hand it to them\u2026they\u2019re certainly prolific (insert vast sarcasm here). Not as bad as the TYPE O NEGATIVEs or the METALLICAs of the world, SLAYER should still have fingers wagged at them for taking so damn long to get off the road and give us new material in a timely fashion. So one would ask \u201cis this, like the superior \u2018Christ Illusion\u2019, worth the wait?\u201d The answer is a resounding \u201cyes\u201c. While experimental elements were present in previous works, it\u2019s a bit more truncated this time around, where the steamroller of thrash is without most of the mind-fuck moments, though retaining enough to keep it from becoming stagnant. But all in all the band beats the ever-loving hell out of pop-culture and \u201cmetal\u201d bands that have been part of the effluvium of American musical values lo these many, bothersome years. While things start slow with the \u201ctoo much, too soon\u201d title track, things get right down to violent business; the unstoppable wrecking ball of \u201cUnit 731\u201d and \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d hits the immovable wall of \u201cBeauty Through Order\u201d (with a delightfully old-school section half-way through) and \u201cHuman Strain\u201d, where the Jeff Henneman/Kerry King school of riffery and guitar neck strangulation is in full session\u2026a lesson from the book of \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d with a few pages of mid-era death metal is in store, chock full of the metallic fury that have permeated within SLAYER\u2019s many releases, never in short supply. This is pushed along by the backdrop of Dave Lombardo\u2019s ever-so-superior drum work and Tom Araya\u2019s screams of pure insanity\u2026even after all these years, his voice is still strong enough to cause chills to go down spines aplenty. And when combined, the listener is reminded why SLAYER is still one of the last great metal bands in existence.\n\nSo all in all \u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d is a very satisfying listen, where the now-perfected riff butchery, percussive torture and twisted lyrical content combine into a fist of pure metal being shoved into your face. Say it loud, and say it proud\u2026SLAYER!!!!!!!!\n",
        "\nIt's been 11 years now since Slayer screwed the pooch and released the abominable Diabolus in Musica. In the interim, we've gotten a pair of albums that, while not a total bust, were largely forgettable when compared against this band's body of 80s work. So three years pass after Christ Illusion, and the buzz is mounting for World Painted Blood, Slayer's 11th full length release. How does it stack up?\n\nUnfortunately, there is no simple answer to this question. World Painted Blood is by and large a thrash metal album, and I for one am grateful to hear it. But it's not a very good thrash album...it exudes none of the menace or aggression of their many classics, and part of that is a product of the album's production. Tom Araya still sounds quite fierce, but the guitars have a different, crunchy sound to them. This isn't to say they sound bad, but there is a sterile feeling to the album which often scored a few yawns while I was listening. The album does have a few blistering tracks, like \"Unit 731\" and \"Hate Worldwide\", which are certainly as explosive as anything else the band has produced in nearly 20 years. \"Playing With Dolls\" is an interesting track, which teases with some clean vocals and melodies before adopting some chugging, old school Slayer grooves and, well, 'bounce' like lyrics. But I found most of the other tracks to be rather ho-hum for Slayer, pleasant enough to listen through but creating no compulsion to replay.\n\nTo tell the truth, I'm not a whit disappointed by the album, because I have expected little to nothing from this band for years. Musically, the band shows they still have the chops to set themselves on fire. The sporadic leads are still in place, the lyrics are dark, the tone of the album vaguely summons forth nostalgia for Seasons in the Abyss. Of the 11 tracks and 40 minutes, there are about 10-15 minutes where I was clenching my fists and admiring the threat this band can generate. The rest? Meh. I doubt many of these tracks will be making their setlist in the years to come.\n\nHighlights: Unit 731, Hate Worldwide, Not of This God\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThe only reason I bought this album was because I magically found it in a local record shop's bargain bin for $3 ($2 if you count my discount card...whoopie!). I wouldn't have minded seeing Slayer \"back in the day,\" when they apparently actually moved around on stage and were exciting and stuff. However, I questioned the ability of a live album to capture the intensity that supposedly made Slayer such a great live band a long time ago. So is this worth getting or isn't it? Well...\n\nThe track-listing is excellent; this album was recorded during the tour for \"Seasons in the Abyss.\" I happen to really like that album, and it is well-represented here. This comes at the end of a fairly long string of superb releases, so there's plenty of high-quality material to choose from. \"Hell Awaits\" continues to be a killer opener and pretty much every release is well-represented...\n\n...with the exception of the album \"Hell Awaits.\" This is less of a detriment for me because aside from the first two songs, I'm rather lukewarm towards \"Hell Awaits,\" but many Slayer fans will see this as a major slight. That killer \"Your time...slips...uh...way...\" break in \"Raining Blood\" lacks the power of the original. Jeff Hanneman doesn't use the wah-pedal at all, leaving some of his solos to pale in comparison to their studio counterparts. The majority of the songs are (for the most part, just slightly) inferior to their studio versions....\n\n...However, on disc two, there is a section with several songs from \"Show No Mercy\" and \"Haunting the Chapel\" where the live versions are so intense and may even surpass the originals. Slayer really gets into a groove and the best part is album closer \"Chemical Warfare.\" The songs from those first two albums sound slightly thrashier and Araya's more mature vocals add more menace than was present on the originals. Dave Lombardo does a fine job, as is expected, and he really adds something to those older songs now that he's more experienced. The guitar-playing throughout is pretty spot-on, including the solos for the most part.\n\nSo is it worth the money? I'll let that be up to you, although if you can find it in a bargain-bin like I did, it's a must-have. I'm sure I will only listen to it every once in a while, but when I'm in the right mood, it really hits the spot. Perhaps this album would have benefited from stronger representation from the first two albums, but considering which tour this is from, it is to be expected that nearly every song from \"Seasons\" would be played. Sadly, \"Decade of Aggression\" marks the beginning of the end for Slayer, it would only go downhill from here.\n",
        "\nNow kids seriously, this really is a damn good song. I don't see why this particular single is so overlooked here...I mean 3 reviews and average 39%? It should be more like 79%! Because in all honesty this is the best out of those 3 singles that Slayer did before putting out the album. Psychopathy Red was a short and vicious attack sounding like a rejected track from Reign In Blood but Hate Worldwide was one really washed out attempt, there was like one good riff in the entire song and that riff was only in the beginning. But this track, this is way more arranged and more mosh-inducing. There's a coherent intro, decent structure (not entirely verse-chorus shit), kickass riffing, thrash break, everything. I admit some parts sound a little out of place (like the chorus and that melodic riff after the 2nd chorus) but goddamn if this song doesn't get some serious headbanging going on.\n\nNow let's see, the song starts with this type of intro that is first silent then gets louder and louder. What we can hear is some drumming and a weird spoken word piece in some language I don't know. Then there's some guitar melody. This goes on for 56 seconds then you get a chug riff and soon all the instruments start kicking your head right off. Yeah sure this is relatively slower than Slayer's other fast songs (you really don't need an example do you?) but so what, this one should still make any real metal fan bang their heads. The riff is Slayer's typical tremolo stuff although this one is more rhythmic (\"chug\") and not just straight forward fast tremolo. Production makes the drums sound really loud (even though obviously when a beast like Dave Lombardo is playing, he's gonna hit those drums hard) but that shouldn't be too hard to get past, and the vocals are good too (yeah yeah we all know Tom Araya can't scream anymore like he did in Reign In Blood, waah waah, but really he does sound better here than on anything since then).\n\nChorus is where things slow down and it sounds like the song is gonna build up to something. You know that when in a song there's no snare and no cymbals, just bass drums and toms going with the guitars and then the actual drum beat starts and the song kicks off. Well in this song it simply starts the verse again, as if the chorus is building up for verse and not the other way around like it should...did I mention that this song is not perfect?\n\nAfter the second chorus which is around the 2 minute mark we get this kinda melodic riff passage. Now this part may not be full blown thrash brutality but it's still good. And the things get even better when you find out what it was building up to....2:19 fucking THRASH BREAK! Mosh! We didn't get these at all in those 2 other singles so now it's even more than fucking welcome. Seriously this kickass thrash break is why I gave this song 90%. Without it my score would have been something like 70...but not this time. This time we bang our heads. Anyway after this we get Hanneman's solo with the song slowing down even more than previously. Nope, these guys did not return to Show No Mercy days in terms of guitar solos (they had good solos on that album) so all we get is noisy bends, pinch harmonics and whammy bars. \n\nThen there's another build up part with somewhat de-emphasized guitars and Araya's spoken part. He goes on speaking louder and louder until he's yelling already and at 2:49 he does an insane scream....or as insane as he can get anymore. \"In which we trust a secret government is now in total COLLAPSE!\" then the last verse comes and the chorus again and the song is pretty much there. That very ending is a kind of build-up-sounding part again like the chorus but it's pretty quickly over. That was 5:53 of the best Slayer you have heard since Seasons In The Abyss (that's not to say Divine Intervention and Christ Illusion weren't good records but really this is just better than anything on them). By the way the rest of this new record is great too. Check it out if you're not too \"tr00\" and \"elite\" for post-80's Slayer.\n",
        "\n...And thrash metal was all over the place. Most US bands weren\u2019t all that evil. For instance no matter how fast or heavy Exodus were, their riffs still had something hopeful or even happy about them. No, the real darkness came from Europe. Kreator, Sodom, Celtic Frost, you name them. But of course there are exceptions! And the most important once was Slayer. Unamerican darkness surrounded them, Hell Awaits had put them on the map, globally. Slayer ruled supreme. And one month before Dark Angel could become pretenders to the throne by releasing the majestic Darkness Descends, Slayer had come up with something. Something called Reign In Blood.\n\nIt has been said Slayer were very much into punk and crossover and this love culminated in Reign In Blood. Letting go of the principle of long songs following the well known metal dogmas. Or maybe they were just touring so much, living the fast life, they only had a handful of riffs and weren\u2019t in the mood to write elaborate material with the ideas they had this time. In any case, Slayer wasted no time and fabricated 10 songs with such an average pace and length, it could\u2019ve just been another hardcore punk album. However it didn\u2019t turn out to be a punk nor crossover album, not like S.O.D. did a year earlier. There was no comedy whatsoever. What if SOD, DRI and such hadn\u2019t done their parts? Would Reign In Blood have turned out this way? No one can tell for sure.\n\nAnyway, there still were two songs here which were longer (exceeding the 4 minute mark that is) and filled with breaks, changes in pace and a shitload of riffs. We\u2019re talking Angel of Death and Raining Blood. For most of us also the best two songs on this album. These songs really are the missing link between the slightly more elaborate Haunting The Chapel / Hell Awaits approach and the remaining short fast songs on Reign In Blood.\n\nNow what\u2019s the true strength of the incredible speed here on Reign In Blood? Two major important aspects. First of all Dave Lombardo clearly suffers from ADHD here or he just forgot he was in the studio and thought they were performing live. If you compare his performance here to the earlier Hell Awaits album he has gotten rid off all neatness. He just goes berzerk, taking the rest of the band with him since they have no other choice. Rick Rubin managed to capture Lombardo\u2019s intensity as we\u2019d only seen earlier on the live Combat VHS. And secondly there are the non-fast parts, breaks and stop-and-go moments. They have been put in so cleverly, making each fast part feel even faster. It is this specific aspect which since then has been copied so often.\n\nTrimming thrash metal ideas till the pure essence is left. No holds barred and to the point efficiency. As a result a band can create an album such as this only once. Yes, there are quite a few riffs which may sound interchangeable to some, often variations on the same D#, E, G & A patterns but that was the beauty of ancient crossover and in a way a charming detail on Reign In Blood, actually making the album sound more cohesive as a whole as well.\n\nReign in Blood was groundbreaking. And stating that now, two decades later, it might sound generic, simple or monotone in the ears of some younger people just makes the groundbreaking-statement more obvious. It is not without reason the style presented here has since been copied, and therefor further developed, by legions of acts. Slayer were one of those acts who set the standard for fast and furious thrash metal.\n",
        "\nIf I\u2019m not wrong, it was way back in early 2008 or so, that slayer announced that the next album might just be their last. Then in early 2009, they released their first single Psychopathy Red, a fairly praiseworthy and satisfactory effort I must say. But now, we have the full album with us, and I\u2019m wondering just how much of its hype did it live up to. I don\u2019t want to sound like one of those asshole fans who don\u2019t realise how hard it is to make music, but this release has really left me disgusted and heart-broken, and an undeserving hype has never helped the music, as (recent) history will tell us. Death Magnetic? Ah, leave it. \n\nThe problem is not that this album isn\u2019t anywhere near their first 5 efforts, in fact, sound-wise it\u2019s probably closer to it than any album in the latter half of their catalogue. The problem is that Slayer simply refuses to work on their flaws, and here it seems they\u2019ve got more of it than they ever had. While it might be hard to actually compose great songs, being a guitarist myself, I believe I can confidently say that making a few good riffs is really no big deal. But Slayer is far from that. They fail to conquer even the easiest of grounds. In structure, the songs here are unbelievably pathetic and childish, no flow, no continuity, no \u2018moments\u2019 (you know what I mean, right?), nothing. It\u2019s surprising how such experienced and well-known musicians can sound so amateurish, incompetent and downright awkward. Almost all songs start with a variation of that one single riff, gain some pace, maybe slightly alter the tempo, and then suddenly break into a little soloing. Soloing as you might know has always been their weakest territory. Needless to say, here they give further proof to that, using the whammy more than they ever have. This is incoherent music without a start or an end, filled with painfully monotonous tunes and the exact same resentful vocal lines that will pretty soon result in an unbearable headache. \n\nTrust me, there is not an ounce of exaggeration in my words, but then, maybe I\u2019m making a mistake trying to review it as music and not loud-garbage-that-you-can-put-on-as-a-substitute-for-breaking-things-which-obviously-is-something-you-can\u2019t-do. I wish the band had given me something I could talk positively about, except their uncanny ability to infuse power & aggression into their music, something I\u2019ve always appreciated about Slayer. And maybe (I\u2019m trying hard here fellas), I could give them some credit for the fact that they wrote down some lyrics, for they are the only thing that make these songs different from one another.\n",
        "\nAs most of you might already know, Slayer has now nearly 10 albums under their belt. It's almost as if there's no stopping for these dudes. Or should they stop? Seriously, to be a little rational of things here, there's a saying \"If you eat the same recipe, you're sure to get bored of it\". World Painted Blood is showing us that. I mean, come on. Same riffs, same messages, is hard for me to devour something with the same formula without adding newer treatment. W.P.B creates a sea full familiar oldies, that seems to be extremely saturated.\n\nI must say the first 2 tracks were amazing. Never heard of anything like this from Slayer for quite a while. With lyrics that shows they still have fire in them. But right after these two tracks, boy was I wrong. Each of the track reminded me everything about Christ Illusion. \n\nSimilar riffs connected with the same themes in lyrical content, that has been told countless of time with the only difference in period. Even there are some newly written contents on the album, what really made me felt discourage of this whole album is the overtly long lyrical content. \"World Painted Blood\" was by far their longest lyrics ever written in their career (and it's not even written for a long epic song). You got to be kidding me? Was Araya trying to write this for some lame death-rap music? Even if people didn't mine about this, the lyrics didn't have flow. Therefore, it could sound corny as hell. Like the last lines from \"Snuff\"; 'Killing is my future/Murder is my future' was horrible. Writer's block I guess.\n\nLet's jump into the music. As I said before, the riffs, the structure and the content of W.P.B is almost as similar to Christ Illusion. Repetitive riffing and reused materials from previous albums, these I would not call a good sign. Including the annoying high pitch solos from Kerry King and Hanneman. It just shows how noob these guys have went. Christ Illusion was a very pale version of what Slayer did in their early days. Since World Painted Blood has similar structure as Christ Illusion was, they should have name it \"Christ Illusion 2\".\n\nAs we enter the new age of metal with crappy metalcore bands dominating the world, I expect more from old school metal bands like Slayer or Megadeth, hoping they could rid the world of bad modern metal bands such as \"Bring Me the Horizon\" which is the most despicable band in the universe. Instead, what Slayer presented is something that is lacking some juiciness in it. It is good to keep playing the same trademark sound even after 20 or 30 years later because it works for the musician and fans alike. But honestly, do you think it can stand on its own for long? Sometimes a band needs to mix newer things from the outside with the older ones just to see what one gets. Here we have a band basically using pretty much the same blue prints that has been used for nearly 30 years untouched. So what else is Slayer gonna do next? \"God Hates Us All 2\"???\n",
        "\nDon\u2019t you love Christmas? It\u2019s the most joyous holiday of the year, a great feast of colorful lights and hymnal singing and everything else that is completely the opposite of what Heavy Metal is about. As a metal fan, though, it is my duty to spread my own perverse version of the Christmas cheer by exorcising my demons. And what better way to do that than by reviewing the pile of hardcore fucking swill that is Slayer\u2019s God Hates Us All?\n\nI checked this out during a Slayer binge, thinking \u2018no, it can\u2019t be THAT bad! I like Slayer\u2019s formula of angry, scribbled-lines-on-paper Thrash!\u2019 Well, fuck, I\u2019m wrong again, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m paying the price. God Hates Us All is a painfully enervated, lifeless release, especially in the ironic context of the fact that the band are clearly trying so hard to create something angry and full of emotion. They didn\u2019t. What is there to gain from this? A bucketload of misanthropy with some teenage religious doubts on the side? That sounds like fun to me, note the sarcasm.\n\nSo yeah, this album is just full of wonderfully un-metal riffs, one-dimensional vocal diarrhea and that awful modern rhythmic fuzz that makes it sound so\u2026contemporary. There\u2019s nothing on here that even slightly resembles entertainment or metal. The guitars are laughably restrained, as even Kerry King\u2019s paint-splatter solos are not quite as outrageous as usual, and the riffs are all hardcore bullshit without any real power to them. Tom Araya\u2019s vocals are strained and shouty as he constipates his way through about fourteen tracks of monotonous, dicrectionless nu-metal irrelevancy without any shame. Truly, the songs on here are the antithesis of entertainment, with their overly serious, macho posturing \u2013 how can anyone take this seriously at all? Lyrics are laughable too, mostly just juvenile raving and ranting that you\u2019d expect more readily from an online blog or the mind of a twenty seven year old living with his parents trying to be \u2018dark.\u2019 Pfft, I\u2019m more intimidated by the fact that there are people actually defending this album!\n\nThe songs range from boring, try-hard bursts of immature aggression like \u201cCast Down,\u201d the awful \u201cThreshold\u201d and the annoying \u201cWar Zone\u201d to faux-catchy nu-metal stinkbombs like \u201cSeven Faces\u201d and the atrocious distorted layering of \u201cDeviance.\u201d \u201cHere Comes the Pain\u201d has riffs that resemble the rumbling of a hungry stomach, and \u201cPayback\u201d has swearing like Tom just stubbed his toe and burned his hand on a hot stove\u2026at the same time.\n\nI would usually come up with something a little cleverer, but this isn\u2019t that kind of album. God Hates Us All is an album that renders itself unmemorable and weak by a lack of any kind of aggression or drive. The songs here are just too vocal-centered; that\u2019s what it is. I mean, what the hell kind of asshole ever wanted to hear a Slayer album with no metal riffs that just focused on the vocals? That\u2019s probably the worst idea I\u2019ve heard in a while. Pure comedic flop. And that goes double for this album as a whole. What a load of coal droppings.\n",
        "\n1994 was the year in which Slayer were one of the few eighties thrash metal bands still able to exist as well as resist the trends of the nineties. The year in which they released their last old school thrashing album before eventually succumbing in 1998.\n\nYes, of course there was more than only thrash already here. The 5/4 beat in \u2018Killing fields\u2019 and a few mid paced and clean sections. But they\u2019d tried a lot of slower and clean stuff earlier on South Of Heaven and Seasons In The Abyss. So in fact there wasn\u2019t much renewal here. Even Paul Bostaph does his best to drum like Dave Lombardo or better said, to drum as needed for Slayer songs.\n\n\u2018Divine Intervention\u2019 in a way is a carbon copy of Seasons In The Abyss keeping in mind the variation in tempi and balance of aggression and eeriness. Yet the fast songs here are slightly more aggressive and the sharp production does the trick as well. If Seasons In The Abyss would\u2019ve had this production I\u2019m sure even more people would enjoy that album.\n\nBecause of the aggressive, sharp sound and the inclusion of some really short, furious and catchy songs, \u2018Divine Intervention\u2019 builds a nice bridge between South of Heaven and Reign In Blood. Of course for the fans of the old days, Slayer can\u2019t go wrong with thrash metal eruptions such as \u2018Sex, Murder, Art\u2019, \u2018Dittohead\u2019 and \u2018Mind Control\u2019. But even the longer \u2018Circle of Beliefs\u2019 presents us everything there is to like about Slayer.\n\nProblem however is that the slow paced material presented here is of somewhat lesser quality than we were used to keeping songs such as South of Heaven and Dead Skin Mask in mind. So unfortunately no classics in that department. The emphasis is slightly more on groove than eeriness unfortunately. But \u2018SS-3\u2019, \u2018213\u2019 and \u2018Divine Intervention\u2019 are not bad enough to justify people complaining about how mediocre this album supposedly was/is. Hell, the worst slow or groovy songs here are still better than the ultimate lameness that was \u2018Behind The Crooked Cross\u2019 back in 1988. \n\nSecondly, each time you play this album right after the \u2018South of Heaven\u2019 album, it becomes clear the production and especially the band themselves sound double as furious here and ten times as convincing. Araya\u2019s vocals haven\u2019t sounded this pissed since Reign in Blood (with the exception of some moments on \u2018Decade of Aggression\u2019 obviously) so each time I hear someone complaining about how Araya seems to barks his way through this album, they can obviously kiss my rosy buttocks and get in bed with Rob and Judas Priest.\n\nAs said, plenty songs left to give one that good old Slayer feeling and keeping one happy. And the guitar sound is one of my favourites in Slayer history! A lot of people forget to mention this album when discussing Slayer and it has become one of those forgotten releases from the nineties when pretty much all thrash metal acts became utter crap. Yet if one takes time to explore Slayer and listen to \u2018Divine Intervention\u2019 without keeping an era in mind, it becomes pretty obvious this is a quality album no matter when it was released. \n\nHighlights: \u2018Killing Fields\u2019, \u2018Sex, Murder, Art\u2019, \u2018Dittohead\u2019, \u2018Circle of Beliefs\u2019 and \u2018Mind Control\u2019.\n",
        "\nSlayer is one of those bands you either love or hate. I happen to be someone who loves Slayer, I honestly can't say anything bad about them, even their album Undisputed Attitude is actually one I sometimes just jam out to. This is no exception. The main point around this album though is Slayer with a new drummer, Paul Bostaph, who honestly is much like the new drummer for Decapitated, but I'll get into that in a moment.\n\nFrom a critical stand point, Slayer has always been considered the fastest in their field (at least of the Big 4 [Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer]). They still hold that honour in this album, but everything has become more extreme with riffing. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman really out do themselves with their dual soloing and complex riffing. Tom Araya is still top notch with his bass work and vocals, though the constant screaming (particularly from Angel of Death) while on tour is just starting to show as he just seems more into barking than screaming. And Paul Bostaph, while a good drummer, he's nothing like Dave Lombardo. Paul Bostaph is like Krimh of Decapitated, where Vitek had style and could actually control a great beat, Krimh just shoves all that aside and blast beats. Same can be said for Paul, he tries to pull off Dave\u2019s style but just can't seem to keep himself from just playing fast and not actually try to be good.\n\nThe songs on the album itself vary in style. A majority are thrash oriented, like Fictional Reality and Serenity in Murder. Some are a throw back to the old school punk that influenced Slayer like Circle of Beliefs and Sex. Murder. Art. And you can also feel a bit of groove in there as well, 213 and Divine Intervention being the two main ones that stick out here. Kerry King was good friends with Dimebag Darrell by this point, so it doesn't surprise me.\n\nAs said before, the guitar seems more technical now. Songs like Fictional Reality, Serenity in Murder and Mind Control just seem to be trying Kerry and Jeff's endurance a little too much, but it still pays off beautifully.\n\nAnd as much as I rag on Paul Bostaph, he actually has a good piece of drumming going for him on Killing Fields, which actually has a good technical feel to it, kind of like Richard Christy.\n\nAnd back to Tom. As said before, Tom's vocals still tear up ear drums with hate filled lyrics and he all around does a great job here. He also goes for easy going vocals in some songs, like Serenity in Murder, where he has a very foreboding sound to himself, sounding down right creepy and deranged. But in the end, it just starts to feel like he's straining a bit too hard on his voice.\n\nAll around, Divine Intervention still holds up strong and is absolutely awesome. I honestly can say that it's one of my top albums, right after Seasons in the Abyss, but that's another album. If you're a big fan of Slayer and don't own this album, well, then you are a complete idiot. Now go get it!\n",
        "\nI think we've all agreed long ago that reviewing bands like Slayer and Metallica these days based purely on the merits of their newest material is an impossible task, but I will give it my best shot. When bands reach such a size cutting through the hype, the over-exposure and the fanboy idiots is as big a task as listening to the album objectively in itself. Given how long ago Metallica left the realms of 'metal' it has been down to Slayer for a considerable period of time now to manage the space that was vacated by their once thrash-brothers, which given this fact makes it all the more incredible how loved they still are.\n\n\"Christ Illusion\" was no damp squib but it had been 16 long years since Slayer had released anything half-decent, going all the way back to \"Seasons in the Abyss\". I mean, that's nearly one whole \"Chinese Democracy\"! And so while Slayer's early back-catalogue is quite simply a hallowed and untouchable spectrum of work, the band have struggled to remain a force to be reckoned with since and it is through this length of time that unavoidable questions have arisen over the band's worth nearly 30 years after they formed. In this respect \"World Painted Blood\" closes as many questions as it leaves open as on occasion Slayer pull out a riff, or a tempo, that shows some life in the old dog yet but invariably they feel like the dad on a wedding party dance floor, trying to resurrect their moves from their 'prime' while of course being wholly incapable of doing so.\n\nThe production of \"World Painted Blood\" feels as much to do with Slayer's negatives on album number 11 as it does the album positives. On the plus side it accentuates the feel of old-school, as occurred too on \"Christ Illusion\" that I feel is absolutely essential to the making of any great Slayer record, yet in repeated listens I can't help comparing it to the production of \"Reign In Blood\" and safe to say the comparison is not favourable. Before you start screaming \"you can't compare everything to the greatest metal record of all time!! lulz\", think about this fact: for much of \"World Painted Blood\" the riffs and writing feel strongly reminiscent of that 1986 classic yet that songwriting is let down by a vastly inferior and blunter production. \"Reign In Blood\"'s production was light years ahead of it's time but 23 light years ahead? And it is with this comparison I realise in the 23 intervening years Slayer have lost much of their bite and edge that made them veritable gods of their time, as that realisation is frankly unacceptable if you come here looking for a modern day classic.\n\nWith Tom Araya's vocals you can always be sure of just whom you are listening to and for that we can be truly thankful. In the riffs too of \"Public Display Of Dismemberment\", \"Psychopathy Red\" and \"Unit 731\" you would accuse the band on your stereo of ripping off Slayer if it weren't for the fact it was Slayer themselves, and that's no bad thing. After all, Slayer fans don't wish for their heroes to transform into a freeform jazz quartet and if they wish to try and repeat what makes \"Reign In Blood\" the only 11/10 album of all-time that must be admired. But to hear a number of tracks fall short of this standard only confirms what we originally knew: that Slayer are a long, long way past their best. \"Playing With Dolls\" harks back to the kind of slow-song composition I've heard from bands of 16-year-olds who formed last week while \"Americon\" returns the kind of headaches I get when just thinking of 2001's \"God Hates Us All\". This is not to mention on top the number of songs that sit squarely in the middle territory of 'dull', thus making finding anything to say about them difficult - \"Beauty Through Order\", \"Human Strain\" and \"World Painted Blood\". So I\u2019m not going to try.\n\nNaturally we are expecting much but then this is SLAYER!, the band that people willingly carve the logo of into their arms. I'm sure you'll get many claiming a change of underwear was in order after their first listen to \"World Painted Blood\" but ignore them and listen to me instead: there are moments worth shouting about here but if you want to experience these legends at their best do yourself a favour and travel back two decades plus. \n\nOriginally written for Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nAn artist\u2019s youth is arguably his most fertile creative period. It is here, past the struggles of adolescence but not yet at the point of complete maturity, where he develops experience without yet abandoning his instinctual methodology, often creating his most beloved works in the process. In heavy metal, it is far from uncommon to find the majority of a band\u2019s fans worshipping at the feet of their older albums, many going so far as to deride the band\u2019s later works in order to create a sharper contrast between them and the favored albums of old. But while age comes with decreased ability, physical weakness, blurry vision, obsolescence, and a host of other debilitations, the benefits of maturity can be just as far-reaching. And if this experience is reconnected with the fervor of youth, even an old dog can learn a few very impressive new tricks and remind the pups that he ain\u2019t a hound to be fucked with.\n\nWith that, we reach World Painted Blood, Slayer\u2019s tenth studio album. This one managed to sneak up on me quite unlike their last album, Christ Illusion, whose development I followed fervently from first announcement to opening day purchase. That album had \u201ccomeback\u201d hype branded on it from day one, leaving us fans to nervously cross our fingers until we were (mostly) satisfied with the results. World Painted Blood did not have this hype; after all, once you\u2019re \u2018back,\u2019 expectant fans need you to merely keep up the good work. Apparently hype and immediate gratification must be directly proportional, because World Painted Blood didn\u2019t have that going for it either when I finally got my paws on a physical copy. Where Christ Illusion wasted no time demonstrating the renewed vigor of the aging band, World Painted Blood takes time to warm up: its title track, though traditionally in either the opening or closing role on a Slayer album, serves as a less-than-ideal opening cut when compared to some of the album\u2019s other tracks and further exacerbates the patience of those hopeful listeners geared up for the spine-tearing thrash-fest that eventually ensues. But patience is a virtue, as they say, and the virtuous will find that what Slayer has done here is not merely recapture the furiously controlled chaos and vintage riffs of their better days, but the subtlety and unnerving atmosphere of those days as well, all without the throwback vibe that so frequently soils new thrash albums, from young bands and old alike.\n\nThe first intimation of Slayer doing things how they used to is also the most obvious. Slayer once performed the tightest, most genuinely enjoyable thrash metal on the face of the earth, and on at least half of World Painted Blood\u2019s tracks, they seek to do this once again. \u201cSnuff,\u201d \u201cPsychopathy Red,\u201d \u201cUnit 731\u201d and their brood are direct descendents of the sort of thrash that Slayer used to command in the 80\u2019s, most overtly on Reign in Blood. Not every song has the raging thrash hard-on that these songs have, but most of the rest have abundant fast passages of varying degrees of importance in their respective structures. But more on those later: right now, let us bask in the glow of Slayer\u2019s glorious fucking riffs. If there\u2019s one thing this band has never ceased to execute masterfully, it\u2019s no-nonsense thrash. At first, it\u2019s easy to get the impression that\u2019s it\u2019s simply \u201cnew\u201d Slayer playing \u201cold\u201d Slayer, what with some of the lower tuned guitars still making the occasional appearance, but hey, it beats \u201cnew\u201d Slayer playing \u201cnew\u201d Slayer, right? The impression dulls as the album continues, eventually disappearing completely in wake of the fury of the particularly potent \u201cPsychopathy Red,\u201d which is as fearsome a track as they\u2019ve ever written. The people who'd dislike this stuff are probably the same people that haven\u2019t liked anything since Reign.\n\nOne nice thing about these faster tracks is that they break Christ Illusion\u2019s annoying habit of going to hell when the tempo drops. You know the feeling: you\u2019re nicely thrashing along when all of a sudden an unsavory groovy bit hits you hard, reminding you of the GHUA days a bit too distinctly. Here slow passages are handled like they used to be handled, as fucking devastating contrast to the main riffage. There\u2019s one such break in \u201cPublic Display of Dismemberment,\u201d which plummets to a Hell Awaits-era crawl before racing back into the tempo proper. There also a nonlinear feel to the songs that recalls the old days. Verse riffs will mutate as the songs progress, 4\u2019s will be liberally swapped with 3\u2019s in the meter and arrangements, and there\u2019s just a generally unpredictability to these songs without losing fluidity. These sorts of things happen frequently and the moral seems to be that the band is just doing things the way they should be, the way they used to.\n\nNeed more proof? A quick breeze through the liner notes reveals that the songs are once again balanced between Hanneman and King compositions, where the last two albums were heavily King-composed and Diabolus was mostly Hanneman\u2019s blunders. Lyrically we have a return to the plainspoken violence of the old days, with lots of Araya serial-killer literature resurfacing and only a few isolated \u201cKerry King hates religion\u201d dead horse beatings. Now the actual quality of the lyrics is pretty low, as there\u2019s a scrappy, unfocused quality to them that is nowhere near the legitimacy of their old stuff (not to mention the titles\u2026.Slayer have apparently entered a crappy song title competition, and I bet any money that they\u2019re winning\u2026) but the effort is there, and I feel like its honest. And that\u2019s what fucking counts. Certainly someone will slag \u201cSnuff\u201d for opening with a guitar solo and someone else will slag \u201cHuman Strain\u201d for not having one, and I know someone will shit on Tom Araya\u2019s hectic screeching at the end of \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d because he doesn\u2019t sound as good as he did, but it\u2019s all in the name of giving a damn, and there\u2019s plenty of young bands you really can\u2019t say the same thing about. Take \u201cPublic Display,\u201d with its notorious blast beats (Dave Lombardo, more than his bandmates, is at the top of his game on this album from beginning to almost end. He doesn\u2019t use triggers either, as far as I can tell) and death-metal inspired riffing. Slayer haven\u2019t been at the forefront of extremity for something like a quarter of a decade, but does that bother them? Apparently not; they\u2019re playing whatever the fuck they want.\n\nAnd on World Painted Blood, sometimes what they want is to play a little slower. Though Slayer\u2019s most high-profile relationship was their disastrous affair with groove/mallcore trademarks for Diabolus and GHUA, they\u2019ve always been a band that has openly courted controversy. As such, there were bound to be a few tracks on here that would prove controversial due to the latent numskullery of a certain portion of their fanbase. And it\u2019s when the band kicks the tempo back a bit that this is most likely to happen. For instance, the title track has a lengthy buildup before climaxing into a riffset that\u2019s a few bpm\u2019s less than one might expect, particularly for an opening track on a fucking Slayer album (more like an old Exodus tempo). But it works, and the middle part is as memorable as any they\u2019ve ever crafted. Getting into the meat of the album, the listener will find Slayer willing to go slower still. \u201cHuman Strain,\u201d \u201cPlaying with Dolls,\u201d and especially \u201cBeauty Though Order\u201d find the emphasis shifting away from speed, immediately calling to mind their unfortunate turn of the millennium experiments. The actual result is a reemergence of the atmospheric emphasis that they introduced on South of Heaven, developed on Seasons in the Abyss, and refined on Divine Intervention. \u201cBeauty Through Order\u201d doesn\u2019t seem too out of the ordinary (though it appears to be about Elizabeth Bathory, which is cool), that is until the bridge suddenly lurks from out of the shadows and strikes the same chord of menace so often utilized by this band (see: \u201cBehind the Crooked Cross,\u201d \u201cDead Skin Mask,\u201d \u201cDivine Intervention,\u2019 among dozens of others). \u201cHuman Strain\u201d has a similar effect, the riffs suddenly evaporate leaving one strange chilling sequence, heightened by Tom\u2019s vocal melody (yes, he uses those again, further reinforcing the Seasons/South of Heaven influence). It is the creepy, disturbing variety of Slayer riffage that has not been properly employed since the old days, and I tell ya, I didn\u2019t even realize that I missed it until this album so eloquently reminded me how well it can be done.\n\nIt is three of the last four tracks on the album that somehow prove most controversial and, aside from the overall lyrical weakness, are the only detrimental bits on World Painted Blood. \u201cPlaying with Dolls\u201d is one of the experimental ones, featuring a \u201cnew\u201d Slayer riffset that takes the idea of the intro riff from \u201cJihad\u201d and expands it into a whole song. It\u2019s not a highlight (Tom\u2019s clean vocals are not as chilling as they were on say, \u201cSerenity in Murder\u201d) but it has some interesting melodic interaction that fits with their resurrected atmospheric intentions. \u201cNot of This God\u201d has Kerry and Jeff dusting off their 7-strings for another go and the results are also mixed. The fast parts are passable; the bridge can\u2019t help but remind you of Disturbed or something. Only one track deserves not to be here, and that\u2019s \u201cAmericon.\u201d Not only are the lyrics noticeably worse than anywhere else, its clunky groove riffs stake out a middle ground between the enjoyable thrash and atmospheric bits showcased earlier without being thrash, atmospheric, or enjoyable. Arguably one of the most tedious songs they\u2019ve ever written, up there with \u201cOvert Enemy,\u201d \u201cWicked,\u201d and the ones they did with Ice T and Atari Teenage Riot. \n\nAs a final aside, those interested in picking up the album will notice that there are two different versions floating around: the regular and the special edition. The difference? The special edition costs more and features a DVD with a 20-minute \u201canimated graphic novel\u201d based off the music of the album. I\u2019m pretty ridiculous about having all of Slayer\u2019s extra shit (for instance, I\u2019m one of those saps that bought the Christ Illusion rerelease as well as the original) and even I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t fall for this shit. The \u201cfilm\u201d is poorly produced and amateurish, not to mention entirely predictable. After about three minutes in, you know exactly how the other 17 minutes are going to go. It also has very little to do with the album\u2019s music, merely featuring little snippets here and there (including one non-album track which probably rules, if you could hear more of it that is). In short, it\u2019s lame as hell, so get the regular edition if any at all. Anyone needing proof can find the video on Youtube anyway.\n\nThose wanting a full return to Reign in Blood aren\u2019t going to get it. Neither are those wanting a return to South of Heaven or Christ Illusion or any other one of their albums. But while it isn\u2019t exactly the new Slayer album you might have wanted, it\u2019s the new Slayer album that you need. World Painted Blood is the sound of an aging band once again operating at the peak potential for where they\u2019re at. Perhaps not as transcendental as the sound of youth, but the sound of age comes with self-assurance in the quality of your material, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s fitting trends or if the fans will dig it. The result here is the most fluid compositions and legitimate intensity we\u2019ve seen from Slayer in a long time. It\u2019s a grower, for certain, but the payoff is more than satisfying.\n\nHighlights: \u201cBeauty Through Order,\u201d \u201cPsychopathy Red,\u201d \u201cPublic Display of Dismemberment\u201d\n",
        "\nSlayer has been around a long time; that much is unquestionable. These guys got popular way back in the 80s, ironically for promoting things that were generally unpopular, like Satanism, bloody crosses, evil demons and everything else that made the soccer moms quiver in their expensive green station wagons. So, with such a history of blasphemous blasphemies, how does Slayer\u2019s latest foray into grimy, hate-filled metallic misery entitled World Painted Blood stand up? Pretty damned well, I say.\n\nI mean, okay. It\u2019s not great. It\u2019s not even really that good from an objective point of view, but, damn, it\u2019s fucking Slayer. I didn\u2019t really know what to expect, but they churned out a really thrashy, ballsy album, especially for guys who have been past their prime for the better part of the last twenty years. World Painted Blood is filled with short, angry manifestos that have as much attitude as a boozed up Hell\u2019s Angel on a fourth of July rally. Sure, the solos are messy and barely even sound like solos to begin with, and sure the music is sloppy as all get out, but that\u2019s the charm of the whole thing! At the core, the band exudes primal, pure attitude from every pore.\n\nThat\u2019s the best thing about Slayer, you see; the attitude. These guys write music that is so cathartic to the angry mind that it made them famous, and it carried them kicking and screaming through whatever trend of the day arose, coming out bruised, but mostly unscathed. And World Painted Blood continues this, without an inch of subtlety or restraint in their blood at all. The title track is a heavy, chugging ball-buster, with Tom Araya belting out brash, hastily written lyrics with enough energy to topple a street full of power lines. The band follows up with ass-kickers like \u201cSnuff,\u201d \u201cPublic Display of Dismemberment\u201d and the more calculated \u201cBeauty Through Disorder,\u201d which has some nice build ups for the grinding riffs. Really, the only song I don\u2019t like on this thing is \u201cPlaying with Dolls,\u201d which falls victim to some truly ghastly experimentation. Seriously, guys, lose the alt rock guitar strumming. It\u2019s lame as fuck.\n\nThe only thing truly wrong with this is the production, which sounds like it belongs to some lame nu-metal band or something, not a classic Thrash band like Slayer. Bring back the gritty Reign in Blood guitars and ditch the modern shit. There are also some parts that get pretty Hordes of Chaos-esque embarrassing, like the chorus of \u201cNot of This God\u201d in particular. Yeah, Tom, nice vocals there. You sound about as credible as a kid throwing a temper tantrum, it\u2019s just pitiful.\n\nBut otherwise, good job, Slayer, you smashed my expectations for this album with an iron-barbed ax. World Painted Blood is heavy, vitriolic, fast and gnarly, with a lot of bite and vinegar added in. And since I know you\u2019re all waiting for the part of the review where I compare it to the recent releases by the other Big 4 bands, yes, I think this is better than Death Magnetic and Endgame. A Thrash band releasing material in 2009 that is in the same ballpark as their 80s material? Fuck me sideways; it finally happened.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nSlayer has been somewhat of a strange entity at this point in time because their name seems to be synonymous with both the worlds godly and shit at the same time. Their 80s work is easily some of the best in the genre of thrash, where as their 90s stuff has been\u2026Well, not so great. Suffice to say, I haven\u2019t been too impressed with their 90s work before as it really played off the whole nu/alternative scene which I always though was quite crass. On Christ Illusion, they sort of bred out some of the nu-metal tendencies, but they were still apparent. What is great about World Painted Blood is that it\u2019s a sign that they\u2019ve almost completely bred the nu-metalness out of their music! Only 4/11 tracks are not total old-school-Slayer thrash metal!\n\nThe album starts off with the evil title track which is equal sinister sounding as it is catchy, although it does lack a little of the \u201coomph\u201d that the rest of the album has when it comes to thrashing out. After that, the tracks Unit 731,Snuff and Hate worldwide take you back in Slayer time, putting you through a barrage of Slayer\u2019s signature break-neck thrash riffs, guaranteed to destroy your vertebrae with the balls out, thrashing attitude of old school Slayer. The track afterwards, Public Display of Dismemberment, sounds somewhat like black metal for a bit, especially in the opening riff which is all tremolo picked single notes with some raw distortion, and the drumming is almost purely snare drum smacks and blast beats. On the next track, it slows down into some average (but not horrible considering Slayers previous work) groove metal tracks which aren\u2019t very impressive. After that little break, you\u2019re exposed to another dose of head banging with Psychopathy Red. Afterwards, it\u2019s down into the most bizarre Slayer song I\u2019ve ever heard: Playing with Dolls. One second it sounds like radio rock, and then it sounds like Jihad from the previous record. It then plays into some evil sounding slow riffs, to attract your interest. Finally, the last track, Not of this God, ends the record on a very high note with one of the better Slayer tracks I\u2019ve heard, with their evil tremolo picked notes and violent riffs and drumming leaving you completely bruised.\n\nNow, to say this album is totally on par with their 80s work would be a false. It would be near impossible as they are way too old to go all out throughout a record like they used to, as seen here. Despite this, World Painted Blood definitely has some of their strongest work since Seasons in the Abyss, going back to the Reign in Blood style of brief blasts of sinister sounding tremolo picked notes between heavy riffs and chaotic drumming, but not so much that the average song isn\u2019t under 2 minutes long. I must say, World Painted Blood may very well be a future classic.\n\n\nThe instrumental work on this album is definitely a notch higher then that of anything since Seasons in the Abyss. It contains Kerry and Jeff\u2019s random, rusty razor soloing that plays as it\u2019s described as well as the aforementioned violent thrash riffs that made them icons of the 80s. It also sees some of the more diverse work such as some use of the Wah pedal and the finger plucked style like on Playing with Dolls. \nOne of the higher points on this album was Dave Lombardo\u2019s use of blast beats. Now, he is no stranger to the use of blast beats, but in my opinion he never used them with the right riffs. This time he did. On the track, Playing with Dolls, it gives a particularly head smashing effect to the other wise, slow riffs and, as I mentioned before, the blast beats stick out particularly on the track Public Display, as the track has a sort of black metal vibe to it. Other then that, Lombardo sticks within his usual comfort zone when it comes to his drumming: fast snare bashes and whirlwind smashing. To asses Tom Araya\u2019s division, the bass guitar doesn\u2019t really make much of an appearance on this album, but when it does stick out it very much adds to the smashing sound of the drums and while the vocals are nothing new for Slayer, Tom still sounds somewhat reminiscent of the 90s, but not bad enough to do any damage to the record.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are not very new for Slayer. Dwelling more on a sort of genocidal or anarchy theme for a lot of the songs, it\u2019s still Slayer\u2019s dark, evil lyricism that makes them who they are. The mood hangs around a sort of feeling of chaos and violence, a sort of anechoic future where there is only war. The minor clashing of instrumental dominance in the production also adds to this atmosphere, which I think was intelligent of them as all the golden Slayer records had some sort of chaos about them via the production. Whether it was the lack of production on Hell Awaits or the muddled production of Show no Mercy. The only problem I could find with the structure would be in the placement of the slower tracks. You go from straight thrashing to some groove/alt stuff which somewhat kills the vibe until the next thrasher. I think they could have just left those tracks out to be honest, because excluding Playing with dolls; none of them are anything special.\n\nI think that based on the amount of time it took to make this, Slayer deserve a pat on the back for what they\u2019ve put out. Tom Araya himself has stated he\u2019s considering calling it quits soon, and to be honest, if this is Slayer\u2019s last record, it would definitely be one hell of a final record and well worth being the final chapter in the book that is Slayer.\n",
        "\nIn my personal experience, it seems acceptable in the metal community to completely dismiss Slayer after \"Seasons In The Abyss\" in 1990. And for a while, I'd have agreed. Some fans say they haven't been good since South of Heaven, some say they haven't released a good album since \"Divine Intervention\". Whichever you may think, Slayer definitely has altered their music since the 90's, and the wariness that Slayer fans felt then has carried over into the 2000's. \"God Hates Us All\" was down-tuned and appealing to the \"nu-metal\" crowd, whereas \"Christ Illusion\" in 2006 only partly made amends for the 16 years prior to it, but ultimately failed. As we almost close out the first decade of 2000, Slayer returns once again with their tenth studio album. And Slayer fans should rejoice: they're back. Kind of.\n\nFirst things first: There are some songs on this album that sound like they come right out of their '80s period. The beginning of \"Snuff\" sounds right at home on \"South of Heaven\" and \"Public Display Of Dismemberment\" could be mistaken as an unused track from the \"Reign In Blood\" sessions. Of course, Slayer still has some faults. There are still unconventional \"Slayer songs\" which do nothing but harm the band at this stage. \"Human Strain\" is definitely an odd-sounding song and ultimately sounds like something off of \"God Hates Us All\". I understand why Slayer wouldn't want to make a straight-up, balls-out thrash record at all times, but they've been like that for the better part of 20 years now. Had they taken the Slayer formula of war and satanic lyrics with speed and solos, this could've easily been album of the year. Another fault that should be mentioned (as I'm sure it's been mentioned about Slayer since 1994): Tom needs to stop yelling. It's sounding too forced these days. \"Playing With Dolls\" has a creepy vibe throughout and it features Tom actually singing through parts of the song which make it a very interesting song, albeit lacking in the end. \n\nAlso: \"Americon\" might just be the stupidest Slayer song ever released, lyrics-wise. Without even looking, I bet that Kerry King penned the lyrics. \"It's all about the motherfuckin' oil/Regardless of the flag upon its soil\". COME ON.\n\nBut I digress. \"World Painted Blood\" injects new life into the worn down thrash machine that is Slayer. \"Unit 731\" and \"Snuff\" have enough breakneck speed to satisfy old-school thrash fans, and \"Psycopathy Red\" might just be the best Slayer song written since 1990. The band still has its chops. The songs are still unmistakably Slayer, but they must have been listening to the myriad of forum posts on the internet about the guitar solos sounding the same. Lots of varied stuff here, but not enough to forget that it's Mr. King and Mr. Hanneman on the axes. The bass break (first ever for Slayer?!) in \"Psycopathy Red\" shows Mr. Araya has still got it, even if he needs to stop screaming all the time. Trust us, Tom. You sound a lot better when you let the lyrics come naturally. I've always been a huge fan of Mr. Lombardo's skill on the skins, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem like it really shines through on this album. Not to say that it's bad, just nothing too special.\n\nThe mix is not good on this album. It's not \"Death Magnetic\" bad, but it's still not that great. You have to really listen to pick up the drumming and the guitars are pretty \"tinny\" at times as well. It shouldn't make too much of a difference to die-hard Slayer fans, though.\n\nAt the end of the day, Slayer released a record. As the most consistent of the Big 4 of thrash metal, that should be more than enough reason to pick it up. But if you need more convincing, just know that \"World Painted Blood\" has Slayer back to being the thrash monster terrorizer that we all know and love. It's not perfect, but as long as you don't compare this album to any of their other albums (which you shouldn't do anyway), you'll find that Slayer is faster, hungrier, and a hell of a lot more evil than they have been in a while. SLAYER!!!\n\nStand-out tracks: Unit 731, Snuff, Psycopathy Red\n",
        "\nAfter many, many years of global Reign In Blood adoration it has almost become fashion this new millennium to rediscover and worship Show No Mercy. It is a good album, sure, but Slayer were only half way here to shedding their cover skin and finding their own style and sound as perfected as on their next 4 albums. Just like Anthrax\u2019 debut, this album is still filled with too many blatantly copied ideas from the acts they used to cover in the earliest days of their existence. Yes, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and of course Venom (and to a lesser amount Mot\u00f6rhead) are all over the place here. However, it must be said that because of Araya\u2019s typical voice and Lombardo\u2019s drumming, the band already come very close to their own sound. King and Hanneman were only halfway.\n\n\u2018Evil Has No Boundaries\u2019, \u2018Fight \u2018till Death\u2019, \u2018Black Magic\u2019, \u2018Final Command\u2019 and \u2018Show No Mercy\u2019 are 5 tracks on which Slayer show their fast potential and differentiate themselves already a bit from the other early day speed and thrash metal groups emerging from their basements. These songs are ridden with obvious Venom influences (almost similar to Bathory\u2019s debut a few months later) and showcase more palm muted riffing than Venom ever dared. The funniest thing of course being that Slayer and Bathory both copied a lot of Venom on their debut albums but were able to actually pull it off much better than Venom themselves in terms of tightness. \n\nWith \u2018The Antichrist\u2019 and \u2018Die by the Sword\u2019 the band delivers two mid paced songs which are catchy as well as pretty \u2018evil\u2019. A remarkable achievement and it\u2019s not without reason these two songs have remained live favourites all these years.\n\nWhich brings us to the \u2018bad\u2019 here. I\u2019ve never been too fond about \u2018Metal Storm/Face the Slayer\u2019. The song drags too much. There is a certain attempt at regaining the \u2018The Antichrist\u2019 and \u2018Die by the Sword\u2019 atmosphere but it just falls short simply because there are too many awkward breaks and dull in-between riffs messing up the tension. \nThe attempt at playing Clive Burr rhythms, filling the song with one Maiden rip off after another and Araya\u2019s activities which some might call \u2018singing\u2019 make \u2018Crionics\u2019 sound like a cover gone horribly bad.\nThe earlier mentioned \u2018Final Command\u2019 even tries to combine Maidenesque riffing with Venomish intensity and even though it works just enough to be called decent, the lame intro and constant borrowing of riff blueprints does get annoying. \u2018Tormentor\u2019 is just plain dull. The main riff is neither heavy nor evil and disappears into NWOBHM mediocrity. Not to mention the godawful chorus.\n\nMy first introduction to Slayer was Hell Awaits and from that point on I really got into Reign. When I first heard Show No Mercy it simply didn\u2019t convince me. And as a whole it still does not, save a few tracks. And even those tracks I prefer hearing live since I\u2019ve never liked the production here. Especially the drums sound incredibly lame with an overdose of cheap basement reverb. Years later Decade Of Aggression really showed how these songs could and should sound.\n\nShow No Mercy is a decent debut but not close to what was to come\u2026 for instance when they unleashed Chemical Warfare unto the world a few months later, that\u2019s when hell really froze over!\n",
        "\nThe title track for the upcoming World Painted Blood album just seems like a rehash of older Slayer material although watered down in some aspects. Nothing you haven't heard before and done a lot better.\n\nFor a Slayer song you would expect either speed or catchy riffs but this is neither. The song sticks to an okay sem rememorable thrashy main riff although the spoken intro is quite annoying and pointless. Tom Araya's vocals are totally embedded in the riffs of King and Hanneman (similar to Black Sabbath's Paranoid although more embedded) to the point that he can be quite hard to understand despite the relatively clean and tame vocal style. Tom's vocals have blatantly aged not very well and he show signs of struggling to keep up despite the studio magic and mid paced speed of the song. The drum work is alright also, I like the drums in the intro, it gives the song a build up although doesn't act upon it very well. past the intro the drums are nothing that any other generic drummer couldn't do. Lombardo's fast drum work that the typical slayer fan would enjoy is absent from any part of the song. Bass isn't particularly worth mentioning in any aspect.\n\nSlayer were never praised for their solos and have made some songs worse for them e.g Raining Blood but the solo in this song is a new dimension of horrible for Slayer. The solo sounds like a mosquito and a chainsaw having sex, such an annoying drone produced by the whammy. How could they think that the solo would have worked in any context? I would of rated the song a fair bit higher if the solo was absent. The spoken bits within World Painted Blood could of also been eradicated as they only serve the purpose of adding length to the song and don't contribute to the song in anyway. 5:53 could of been cut down to a solid 5 minutes and been better for the experience.\n\nIf you have heard any of Slayer's material from the 80's there is no reason to own this. Slayer are clearly thrash metal on this release but it adds nothing new or remotely exciting to the genre. Perhaps a first time Slayer listener will appreciate it but a veteran fan will turn their back upon it. It will be sad that when the full length of World Painted Blood comes out that it will most likely be mediocre Slayer drible and receive more recognition and sales than most of the best thrash releases of the 2000 era e.g Kreator, Destruction and even Megadeth. You can respect them for still giving it a go in 2009 although not a very good effort. World Painted Blood is nearly three decades since their debut but this dog has to be put down asap before they embarrass themselves even more.\n",
        "\nFor the first time in their career Slayer released a copy of an earlier album. The growth of their first 5 years obviously stagnated and now the band focussed more on perfecting and crystallising everything they had tried earlier. The result is called \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d.\n\nWhereas South of Heaven did have a few faster songs, they increased the amount a bit here to achieve a better balance. The best example of the slow-fast approach the band attempted on South Of Heaven and perfects right here would be \u2018Spirit In Black\u2019. \nAs far as slow material goes, \u2018Dead Skin Mask\u2019 and \u2018Seasons in the Abyss\u2019 simply continue the slow eerie slow thrash approach the band experimented with on South Of Heaven. Both these songs have good melodies and keep up the tension throughout. The band, especially Araya, sound a lot more at ease this time on this kind of material making the songs sound convincing as hell.\n\nNext improvement was that the faster songs on \u2018Seasons in the Abyss\u2019 were much better than the ones on South Of Heaven. Okay, they\u2019re not on par with their best efforts from Hell Awaits nor Reign In Blood, but especially \u2018War Ensemble\u2019 and \u2018Born Of Fire\u2019 are simply superb well composed furious thrashers with a high level of catchiness.\n\nAnd of course there were the groovy mid paced songs. Remember how Araya almost single-handedly killed \u2018Behind The Crooked Cross\u2019\u2019 on South Of Heaven? Well, he has learned much, found his strength again and really adds something to \u2018Blood Red\u2019, \u2018Expendable Youth\u2019 and \u2018Skeletons Of Society\u2019 this time. I wish he had given a performance like this two years earlier.\n\nNow what is it that makes this album still not good enough to be called an excellent slayer album? Simply two things. Lack of true character and production. The lack of character lies in the fact that the band only uses old tricks here and mainly focuses on three key types of songs, strategically placed upon the album. A very contrived album to be honest and of course playing very safe.\nThe production, though better than South Of Heaven as far as drums and vocals go, still falls a bit short concerning the guitars. King & Hanneman both have a \u2018fluffy\u2019 sound which suits the mid- and slow paced material better than the really fast songs. As far as the guitars go I still prefer the much sharper Reign In Blood or even Divine Intervention approach. Thrash guitars should have more definition than here on Seasons in the Abyss.\n\n\u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d is just good. Nothing more, nothing less.\n",
        "\nI could go on rambling about how important Slayer were during the eighties and how redundant they had become during the turn of the millennium. Or even how divided the fans now are since the return of Lombardo and Slayer\u2019s attempt (?) at reliving their eighties thrash metal days. But I\u2019m here to discuss 1998, the year in which Slayer had a wild mood swing.\n\nWith each album during the eighties Slayer did things differently. But let\u2019s be honest they actually only became less and less melodic on their first three albums and each time a bit faster. NWOBHM orientated speed metal on the debut, full-on satanic thrash on Hell Awaits, culminating in Reign In Blood where the in-your-face-and-skip-the-long-songs crossover attitude almost took over the group entirely. By 1988 Slayer felt the need to incorporate some real melodies. Or was it just Hanneman?\n\nOne can clearly hear the uneasiness in Araya\u2019s voice having to \u2018sing\u2019 all of a sudden over these melodic songs. And from time to time he does a good job and manages to even give the melodic songs some energy and balls. The title track would be the best example. The catchy melodies and vocals work out fine here and it can be considered a very cleverly composed and convincing song.\nMandatory Suicide finishes second in the great mid-paced-songs-department. This song focuses more on riffs than melody and works out nicely.\n\nIt\u2019s with songs like Behind The Crooked Cross, Read Between the Lies and Spill the Blood that the band truly sounds tame and uneasy. Groovy parts and a horribly failing Araya being stranded between singing and shouting monotonously. No matter how great some parts of these songs might be on paper, the performance here not only sounds uneasy but it becomes obvious some band members are really holding back because they simply don\u2019t \u2018feel\u2019 this new approach yet and make the songs sound rather tame.\n\nSilent Scream, Live Undead and Ghosts of War sound like Slayer of old again. Ghosts Of War, despite its incredibly powerful beginning, slowly dies out. All three are good songs but a more focussed Araya and especially a more vile production could have given these songs that bit extra which made their previous albums so superior.\n\nIt was of course the surprise that Slayer, right after their most furious and groundbreaking album, dared to come up with this, which made South Of Heaven such a fascinating album back in \u201888. And of course it truly is. They did not play safe and really deserve some credit for that. However the uneasiness, especially vocals and production, have always prohibited me from really enjoying this album. Araya\u2019s singing on the verse of Behind The Crooked cross probably is the best example of an experiment going horribly wrong.\n\nBecause of the daring attitude, dynamic diversity and a handful of pretty good songs, this album is good enough to keep in my Slayer collection. South Of Heaven is considered a landmark by many just because it was their first album on which they pulled off something like this. But in fact the group improved this approach on \u2018Seasons in the Abyss\u2019 with intrinsically better songs and much, much better vocals. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\n",
        "\nSlayer are one of the few bands that have earned the respect of all metal fans. No matter what their favorite genres are, power, progressive, death or black, they accept Slayer as the top extreme metal band. Therefore every new album they are about to release is awaited with great eagerness and anxiety. Such were my feelings for Diabolus In Musica, the successor to Divine Intervention, which to be honest hadn\u2019t lived to my expectations but still, was rather good. Bearing in mind that the in-between release, Undisputed Attitude was something they did just for fun, I prayed this time I would listen to the good old Slayer. What a fool I\u2019ve been!\n\nThis album is the total disappointment, the end of Slayer if I may say so. Where is the thrash metal in here? Where are the spiting fire guitars and the machine-gun drums? Where are the vomiting vocals by Tom Araya, the once master of screams? Where are the songs meant to make you suffer severe head and neck injuries from the non-stop headbanging? Where is the Slayer we knew and worshiped? \n\nI am sorry to say it but they are dead or if you prefer they are catching their final breath. Slayer have sold their souls to the altar of hardcore (!!) and have disgraced all of us, who stood by them through all those years. I never believed they would come to the point to sound like Suicidal Tendencies or I don\u2019t know what the fuck else. The only one I don\u2019t blame for this is Bostaph. His role in the band is insignificant and he is there just to play the drums. They might as well have used a drum machine. Men, Dave Lombardo was very clever to step away.\n\nWhat we had heard in Divine\u2026 is now in full development. The glorious, deadly thrash riffs have given their place to hardcore themes and tunes. Araya\u2019s vocals are cold and dead. They no more send shivers down your spine. Instead they wanna make you scratch your balls out of boredom. Most of the songs are soulless and completely dull. They are based upon the same structure. Slow intros, then they go hard-shit-core. At some point they throw us a bit of thrash to fool us like a bone thrown to a dog to trick its hunger. Then they wrap it up in a nice hardcore pack end everything is well. Most of the people I know that listen to hardcore liked this album a lot. Does that tell you something?\n\nThere are only a few songs that remain out of this shit-hole. The opening track, Bitter Peace is quite good with sharper guitars and a more \u201cthrashy\u201d feeling. Also Overt Enemy and Scrum are closer to the spirit of the old greatness than the shit-ness I experienced with the rest.\n\nI have Diabolus In Musica on tape and I have written at the end of the tape the track Lesbian Show by Nightfall from Greece. THIS is the best song of the tape!! I\u2019ll say no more out of respect for what Slayer used to be. Slayer R.I.P.\n",
        "\nIt seems that Slayer have sunk so far into the mire that there is simply no coming back. They\u2019ve already released two abysmal singles, and don\u2019t seem to care in the least that they are quickly losing the upward momentum they had only barely established in the first place. As if further evidence were necessary, their worst single yet has just come to spit in the faces of all things musically worthwhile.\n\n\u201cWorld Painted Blood\u201d is the latest in a string of particularly nausea-inducing tracks from a band that ceased to be at all relevant almost twenty years ago. The band seems to fully intend to shatter any and all hopes of an increase in quality, rather pointedly traveling the opposite direction with each and every new song revealed. \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d sucked, \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d didn\u2019t fare much better, and now this latest sleeping pill has earned the prestigious title of \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d Everything comes off as completely stale, no doubt due to the incredibly overdone production. (People called Endgame \u201cdigital?\u201d Just listen to this!) As a fairly predictable supplement to the sterilization of sound, Slayer has also delved into Exodus\u2019s recently established kingdom of pseudo-thrash metalcore. Seriously, the riffs reek of chug overkill, and Araya\u2019s vocals through most of the song consist of monotone barking (albeit a little less strained than on previous singles). The drums have an awful, weak tone, and lack all traces of Dave Lombardo\u2019s signature power. Of course, they fit right in with all the other layers of vomit on display.\n\nThe first minute or so consists of literally nothing but incomprehensibly quiet foreign speech and, eventually, some horribly boring slow \u201criff,\u201d just before erupting into a chug-fest. The solo is similarly uninspired drivel, and actually manages to suck more than the verse patterns. Araya, at a rare point when he\u2019s not ripping off \u201cFlesh Storm\u201d in the verse (which itself simply copied \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d), engages in a spoken rant worse than Megadeth\u2019s lackluster efforts ever managed to get. The combined experience is one of almost physical pain, together with a strong urging to punch the entire band (and the producer) in the mouth \u2013 with brass knuckles.\n\nDo these guys honestly think that what they\u2019re coming up with nowadays even remotely has any worth? It\u2019s quite tempting to say that at the moment, they are even worse than Anthrax, extreme as that may be. Judging by all the information released about the new album \u2013 the singles, the artwork, the track names, and so on \u2013 World Painted Blood will prove another absolutely phenomenal exercise in auditory trauma. Don\u2019t expect much from this one.\n",
        "\nSlayer is one of my all time favourite bands. They have been that for over a year now. I was completely going insane about Slayer a year ago, and I still am. So what does Slayer have to offer here?\n\nThe song starts with a kind of creepy intro, which reminds me of some of their old intros (Hell Awaits, Reign In Blood). Then it goes into a Slayer-like riff, and after that, the drumming and Araya's vocals kick in! This song is actually pretty interesting, since I have never heard a Slayer song in this tempo before. There may be, but not one I've heard yet. Either their songs are faster, or slower. So it was interesting that they would finally make a song like this.\n\nI know that there is one thing that's gonna annoy me with this album, and that is the drum sound. That annoys me of course in this song as well. I hope we don't get another St. Anger to join Metallica's disgrace. But I don't think so though. Slayer had their down-time with Diabolus In Musica, which was a dissapointment indeed. Then they got back in the game with Christ Illusion, but how are they gonna do this time? At least, this song sounds promising.\n\nThe music is for the most Thrash. It's kind of re-thrash, since Slayer is pretty good at doing stuff they've already done before. However, I really don't care about this. The stuff Slayer was doing before was good, and now we get to hear similar stuff with more modern production. I don't hate Slayer just because they're kind of ripping some of their old riffs. As long as the riffs are cool, that's what it's all about. Even though Megadeth has gotten much further than Slayer when it comes to being more original, Slayer still kicks a fair amount of ass with their new stuff.\n\nBut now I've been focusing too much on comparing Slayer with other bands, as well as their early work. So let's pretend that I've never heard a Slayer song before, and then I heard World Painted Blood. Then I know I would have said: \"Wow! What a great song!\" However, since I've already heard many other Slayer songs, this song doesn't really surprise me that much. So we will just have to wait and see if this album has some other good songs on it, but I have a feeling this one is gonna be one of the highlights!\n",
        "\nAfter the rather average Christ Illusion I really didn\u2019t have much hope for Slayer. This single affirms my belief that World Painted Blood is going to suck. This song shows that Slayer is trying to go back to what they did in their glory days, yet retain some modern elements. The result is a pretty poor one. There really is never any point of listening to this song, knowing in the back of your head that you could be listening to any of Slayer\u2019s first 5 albums and get a lot more enjoyment.\n\nThe production just plain sucks. It is hard to hear anything over the damn trash can drums. Please don\u2019t tell me this is going to be another St. Anger. The solos sound typical Slayer but a bit awkward and second rate ones compared to their glory days. Tom\u2019s voice is a noticeable improvement over Christ Illusion but it still sounds like he is trying to be angry and pissed off in the manner that he was on the early material without the ability to do it effectively anymore. His voice just sounds watered down and weak compared to what it once was. The guitars are far back in the mix compared to the snare and the vocals so are not heard very well. The riffs just chug along somewhere between groove and thrash territory and are pretty darn boring. A damn shame as the crunchy guitar riffs is what helped Slayer into becoming one of the best thrash bands of the 80s. The leads can be heard a bit better when they come into play and sound pretty good but is not enough to make up for all the bad things going on.\n\nSo yeah this is all there is to it. Just stay happy knowing that their first 5 albums are all great. Keep spinning them instead of wasting your time listening to their new material.\n",
        "\nLive DVDs are rather tricky, they\u2019re either really good, or they completely suck. That is the case with this split DVD Unholy Alliance. Featuring Slayer\u2026and a bunch of talentless side acts like Lamb of God. And let me tell you, this is completely forgettable. \n\nSlayer sounds like a good band to see live don\u2019t they? Maybe not on this DVD but in general yes they would be. Slayer plays only ten songs ranging from good early ere to bad new ere. The worst part about their performance other than some of the songs would be the triggered drums. They just sound so clunky and you can tell that they\u2019re there. Tom\u2019s voice is also not the greatest, but that\u2019s mostly due to age, so you have to deal with that. The crowd is into their performance, every time the camera focuses on someone in the crowd they\u2019re usually flicking off the camera. Some of the songs are actually very good, \u201cAngle of Death\u201d sounds awesome, and \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d also another good one, probably the best song out of the bunch. The green smoke on the stage during the songs also is pretty cool. The new songs still suck even life however, \u201cCult\u201d is horrible, easily their worst song. I found it kind of weird how \u201cReign in Blood\u201d wasn\u2019t on here, after all that is probably the most famous Slayer song. Still Slayer gives the best performance on this DVD and they\u2019re the only reason why anyone should even get this. \n\nAfter the Slayer performance we have Mastodon, and they\u2019re the second best act on here, but that\u2019s only because their competition would include Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, and some act that you probably never heard of. I just don\u2019t get their style, like what exactly are they? They have a lot of groove in their bass, yet a lot of mindless guitar leads with their guitarist. Generally the songs are simple, with basic bass work and a simple rhythm, them some random solo comes out of nowhere. These guys in general are nothing more than a hard rock band with a few interesting solos here and there. The most interesting thing about their performance is that \u201cCapillarian Crest\u201d has an interesting audio clip in the beginning of the song. \n\nNow we come to what is the worst song on the DVD, and it\u2019s by no one other than Lamb of God. We all know these guys suck on album, but holy shit there are unlistenable live. They play \u201cVigil\u201d which I guess is their best song, but like all Lamb of God songs; it sounds like every other Lamb of God song. Basically groove chugging riffs, lame solo, breakdown, another chugging riff, and songs over. Halfway through the song he spends about a minute trying to get the crowd to form a circle pit, but what\u2019s annoying about it is that he is still using his annoying singing voice. Apparently this guys normal talking voice is the exact same as his singing voice. After hearing this song I\u2019m just glad their on stage for only five minutes.\n\nChildren of Bodom would be next, and I\u2019ve never really cared for these guys, mostly because they\u2019re so boring. \u201cAngles Don\u2019t Cry\u201d is dull, sounds uninspired as if they didn\u2019t want to perform it in the first place. Alexi still can\u2019t sing. He\u2019s basically doing hardcore shouts for the whole performance. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d starts off with chugging riffs and an annoying keyboard lead. Alexi still uses hardcore screams, only he\u2019s even more emotionless. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d is just one of those modern teenage oriented metalcore songs, basically the lyrical content of the song is \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck motherfucker\u201d over and over in the chorus. Just like Lamb of God, they\u2019re forgettable.\n\nThe final band is Thine Eyes Bleed, who I never heard of until I heard them on this DVD. I can see why now too, they\u2019re basically modern melodic death, so they got some metalcore influences. Worst thing about their performance is hands down their vocalist. Basically he is your typical monotone singer that consists of hardcore shouts, and ear bleeding shrieks, much like the vocals from Blythe on Lamb of God. Slower groove passages, a weak solo, and ends with a chugging breakdown is how this song goes. Drumming is also annoying due to the fact that the drums are triggered. Triggers are annoying especially when there used with nonstop blast beats. This is just a terrible way to end the DVD, although considering how almost every performance is mediocre to horrible; I guess it makes sense to end it this way. \n\nSo this DVD has gotten a dubbed production job. You know the one where the songs have that semi live feel to them. Every performance has triggered drums; everything has been worked on to sound sharper, crisper guitar sound, more audible bass and what not. But that takes away the whole live feeling of it all. There\u2019s also no intermission or switch to the next song. After every song the screen cuts black, then the band name and the name of the song they will play appears, then it kicks right into the song, there\u2019s literally no interaction with the crowd whatsoever except for the quick Lamb of God bit. \n\nWell considering how only Slayer is worth hearing, and considering how only about half their songs are also worth hearing, this is just a really bad DVD. The guest acts\u2026well all suck really, playing generic metalcore songs at best by all of them. Slayer is the highlight of this album and only six of their ten songs are worth hearing. So if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now you can completely ignore this DVD.\n",
        "\nSlayer has been a very important band in the metal scene. Apart from being my favourite band of all time, they have influenced a truck load of other emerging thrash bands. Slayer have released one of the best thrash albums (read Reign in Blood, Show no Mercy and Hell Awaits). After a few years, they started to go downhill. Their quality took a nose-dive and from a thrash band, they turned to what I like to call, a 'pussy metal' band. The have dissapointed me a lot with their last few albums but I had still not lost hope in them. I heard about a new album soon to be released named 'World Painted Red'. As expected, I was pretty excited. Then came out this single and I got it as soon as I can.\n\nI must say that I am impressed. The song is more like the old Slayer, brutal and in your face! Sure, the excellent song-writing is missing and they have chosen to adapt more 'modern' song-structures but that dosen't take away from the aggression this song projects. Let's start off with Araya's vocals. He has lost a certain amount of aggression but is still pretty much in business. His screams spew total hatred and have a lot of feeling (of hate) in them. His bass is low in the mix but is quite decent and get's the job done. \n\nNow to Kerry and Jeff. The riffs are fast, brutal, catchy and aggressive as well as memorable and head-bangable. The riffs are not too technical, but hey, when was Slayer known for technical riffs! The solos are the same old Slayer, random fret wankery. Yeah, even I hate them, especially the second solo which is a bit elongated. Overall, the guitaring is nice but they should seriously think about stopping with the random fret solos. Dave's drumming is fast, consistent and tight. He hasn't lost a bit of his old self. He still blasts his drum set to oblivion. I have been a big fan of him and though there are certain drummers who out-do him (*cough* Gene Hoglan *cough*), he is still one of the best. \n\nReally, this song can be stated as the 'come-back' of Slayer. I am really expecting a lot from the new album and I hope that it dosen't let me down. I really loved this song and I hope the new album would be as thrashy as this!\n",
        "\nWhile a far cry from good, the newest Slayer song is at least better than the preceding two and a half minutes of incessant boredom. \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d was an almost entirely lame piece of crap that actually managed to be even more derivative than the whole of Christ Illusion. It appears, judging from this and the previous song, that Slayer\u2019s new album will not be anything mind-blowing or even worth listening to.\n\nSlayer seems to have developed a tendency to come up with the dumbest names for all their new material. From the album (World Painted Blood) to this single\u2019s title, the band apparently has jumped on the bandwagon of poorly named \u201ccomebacks,\u201d sharing with Metallica and several other nearly worthless bands. The lyrics are typically retarded for this point in Slayer\u2019s career, and though they\u2019ve never been known for particularly insightful lyricism, they\u2019ve done quite a lot better than this. Just like \u201cPsychopathy Red,\u201d they have also decided to return to the stripped-down song lengths of Reign in Blood, to a much lesser effect. While that album\u2019s short songs worked because of their mind-bending speeds and mercenary aggression, the new tracks just plod along in their only moderately fast pace, not really going anywhere and tending to stagnate very quickly.\n\nThe thing that makes \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d better than the previous is the vocal restraint. Considering Araya\u2019s loss of strength in his voice, not attempting to scream and rather shouting the lyrics mid-range has the effect of making the song slightly less annoying. The guitar riffs still lack any kind of lasting effect, as do the repetitive and mediocre solos, and remnants of Slayer\u2019s insipid groove phase remain in the chorus as the guitars slowly chug along on a single note underneath Araya\u2019s half-thrash vocal patterns. Despite its increased presence on \u201cPsychopathy Red,\u201d the bass is once again nonexistent. Meanwhile, the drumming is, though standard, quite decent and probably the least offensive instrument at work. The end of the song is really the only interesting part, as it cuts off unexpectedly. However, even though it\u2019s somewhat cool, it still leaves a feeling of expectancy and want in its wake.\n\nSlayer has caught the retro-thrash virus \u2013 that is, an inescapable derivation from thrash\u2019s glory days, castrated and watered-down, paired with a sense of redundancy and mediocrity. The band has become a shadow, a self-parody of its former stature, and like all bad thrash rip-offs, \u201cHate Worldwide\u201d belongs in the trash heap.\n",
        "\nWell, this is about the quality I thought Slayer would uphold on their much-anticipated new song. After the thrashy yet derivative Christ Illusion, it was fairly obvious Slayer weren\u2019t going back to their \u201880s glory days. Still, songs like \u201cFlesh Storm\u201d were competent, and there seemed hope for an at least decent new album.\n\nHowever, judging by this song, that doesn\u2019t seem like it will happen. This is Slayer without the groove or industrial tendencies, but even so it is extremely watered down. The opening riff is rather lacking, resembling something a third-tier thrash band would come up with rather than one as great and as well known as Slayer. This lackluster quality in guitar continues through the song, which contains about three riffs, none of them memorable. The solo in no way stands up to earlier shred fests; in fact, it\u2019s actually rather poor. The drums are a bit generic \u2013 there\u2019re too many blast beats and not enough variation. However, the bass takes a stand here, easily heard and actually at the forefront of the production. There\u2019s even a speedy \u201cbass solo\u201d in the middle of the song.\n\nWhat seem to have suffered most, though, are the vocals. Tom Araya sounds like he\u2019s losing his voice from all that endless screaming he\u2019s done over the years. He literally sounds \u201cwatered-down.\u201d Araya\u2019s screams have ceased to be interesting \u2013 the middle of the song contains one that, instead of the high, pitch-sliding screams in, say, \u201cAngel of Death,\u201d holds a single, middle-of-the-road note. In the final section of the song Araya sounds as if he were being castrated without anesthesia \u2013 and it\u2019s awful stuff.\n\nSo, if this is what we\u2019re in for later this year, count me out. There are too many mediocre thrash bands around, and what with Anthrax sucking for almost 20 years, Metallica failing at a comeback, and now this, it\u2019s up to Megadeth to revitalize the \u201cbig four\u201d of thrash. Now excuse me while I go back and listen to Hell Awaits \u2026 again.\n",
        "\nNot that there's much competition, but this would easily be the best Slayer album since South of Heaven, at the very least, if not Reign in Blood. Sure, it's pretty one dimensional, tom shouts all the time and there's a ridiculous amount of double time snare, but a) this is slayer b) covering hardcore punk c) so what did you expect d) dipshit.\n\nNot being much of a hardcore punk conniseur it's pretty hard to give a nuanced account of the songs and how they differ from the original versions, whether Slayer have murdered them or whatever but they sound pretty cool to me, if like every other hardcore punk i've heard. Simple, three chord riffs with a few pretty fast 16th notes and solos thrown in- perhaps to thrash it up, I don't know- a polka beat with some extra speed added and the snare hit harder- lots of yelling with the occaisonal slower section or song thrown in for a breather- the epic doomy/sludge album closer that's \"Gemini\" being a rather cool- and rather surprising- example. \n\nIt's intense and there's heaps of energy, the band tight and really fierce and raw. You have to wonder how much time this took to record- the vibe on the record suggests a very quick, warts-and-all recording, which is pretty ideal for this sort of music. Certainly everyone sounds like they're belting the crap out of their instruments, which is the way it should be. The main drawback being Tom's voice. Sure, doing deep growling when spitting out super fast lyrics like in \"Guilty of Being White\" would be pretty much impossible but it's still monotonous as all hell, mid-range shouting with an almost robotic consistency. Screaming these lyrics out at the top of your lungs is all fine and good, but why not get Kerry or Jeff to do a song or two? Or get them doing gang vocals? Wouldn't be too hard and it'd be a nice break from the sore throat barking. I've always imagined that Kerry has a really high pitched voice though, so perhaps that's why.\n\nNo big deal, though. Complaining about monotonous vocals on songs like \"I don't want to hear it\" or \"Violent Pacification\" is really missing the point of these tunes. They're super fast and full of rage; they get me hyped and pumped, and it's the sort of music that is guaranteed to kill your mother. Not an essential purchase for anyone, but a bit of old hardcore does go down well and good once in a while, so you might as well get this.\n",
        "\nIt's pretty surprising just how quickly the thrash forefathers ditched the NWOBHM and set about exploring a much heavier and darker route; one year prior to this Slayer sounded like a particularly out of control but still pretty melodic speed metal band and now, well, they're this heavy, dark thrashing sort of outfit. They weren't the only band to make a move of this sort, either. What the hell happened between '83 and '84?\n\n\"Haunting the Chapel\" sees Slayer ditch the NWOBHM-ish vibe on their debut and play a rather ferocious brand of thrash that's still fast, heavy and ugly to this day. No attempts at melodic vocals, no Maiden-esque \"Crionics\" style tracks, a muddier, much more fierce production, far more riffs crammed into each song, a relentless pace set by Lombardo's typically energetic and bombastic drumming. It's freakin' cool and really heavy, and with the constant chromatic and low-on-the-fretboard riffing it's not hard to see why Slayer get so much credit behind death metal.\n\n\"Chemical Warfare\" is a good enough example of what you're in for; just massive, super fast riffs pounding your head into a fine, misty pulp with Araya's great (oh, how the mighty have fallen) and authorative vocal, man, the dude had a fine shout/growl back in the day. I could swear the \"chorus\" riff sounds vaguely Hellhammer-ish, so naturally it's really cool. The band's in top form throughout most of the songs; KK's improv solos are only vaguely annoying, Lombardo does his double time snare abuse to absolute perfection, Henneman cranking out typically great riffing with that signature dark style of his (always rated him as a much better guitarist then KK), the whole thing sounding somewhat like two guitars and a drum kit being chucked in a washing machine, fast, chaotic and really awesome.\n\nNo surprise really but the worst song is where Slayer slow it down (relatively speaking, of course) and go for some sort of hardcore/speed metal tune. \"Aggressive Perfector\" is a bit of a shame really, I don't even know why they put it there. It's not a bad song, but after the steamrolling thrash of the previous songs it comes off as rather lame and weak, especially as it's the final track. Perhaps a B-side off Show No Mercy? Regardless it's the obvious weak point, which is a shame as the other tracks are excellent.\n\nIt's somewhere between Show No Mercy and Reign in Blood in terms of quality for me; Slayer were clearly working their sound out at this point and hadn't really morphed into that hideous, multi-limbed thrash beast that they'd be on the next few albums. Oh well. It's still a really good EP that is well worth buying.\n",
        "\nWell Slayer is back\u2026again, and with it has come a lot of justifiable skepticism. Like all members of the Big 4; this band definitely took a nosedive in quality of output since the mid 90s, and have yet to fully recover from it. The question that is naturally on the minds of everyone who was dissatisfied with the halfway back to thrash, middle of the road release \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d is whether or not this will be a genuine return to form or just another collection of semi-groove oriented neo-thrash with a few token thrash songs that will often grab pennies from the creative well of past efforts.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether the new full length will be a solid thrash album or another failed comeback attempt geared towards straddling the lines between old and new, but if this song is any indication of how the album turns out, there is a good degree of hope. \u201cPsychopathy Red\u201d is definitely not a groove metal song and cooks hard the whole way through, and seems to be reaching for a middle ground between the extreme speed and riff frenzied nature of \u201cReign In Blood\u201d and the formulaic and fairly catchy approach of \u201cSeasons In The Abyss\u201d. There is a strong sense of activity in the riffs, drawing upon the dissonant chromatic approach of rapid ornamentation with a proto-death metal feel that was first explored on \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, but in the brief, almost crossover oriented span of 2:30 minutes.\n\nThe only area where this seems to come up short is in the vocal department, as the wear and tear on Tom Araya\u2019s voice after close to 3 decades of screaming his lungs out has definitely taken its toll. He sounds less like a seasoned thrash vocalist in the way that Blitz Ellsworth does (granted, these two have radically different sounding voices) and listens closer to a scratchy hard core singer after a few years of chain-smoking and screaming in a bar loaded with second hand exhalations of other chain-smokers. It\u2019s on point enough to get the job done for this sort of song, but definitely don\u2019t expect the same level of attitude that was reached in the mid 80s.\n\nIf judged by the standards of one of the many fast songs occupying the inner track list between the opening and closing songs on \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, this is a solid song that is sure to get the horns up in the air at concerts. Having said that, it\u2019s also one of those songs that work best when in a full length album occupied by other songs with different pacing and structures, as was the case with the songs that I\u2019m comparing this to. It doesn\u2019t particularly stand well on its own, though I could say the same about \u201cPiece By Piece\u201d, which is a song that I like very much. It would be good to hear a few times before the album comes out, but I\u2019d be hesitant to spend money trying to get one of the limited edition hard copies, unless you\u2019re a real diehard Slayer fan and just can\u2019t wait.\n",
        "\nThere are two kinds of jokes in this world, ones that inspire laughter and ones the cause either a sigh or a very awkward silence. The latter can occur through either a really poor delivery, by touching upon a really offensive topic and not handling it with any level of grace or intrigue, or by trying to guise incoherence as humor. I\u2019d say that \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d is unique that it actually does all 3 in varying degrees, making it among the more auspicious failures that buried the Big 4 in the mid 90s to early 2000s like a mountain of decrepit crud.\n\nUnlike Anthrax, who still maintained some semblance of traditional heavy metal within the abject inferiority of their groove metal releases, Slayer has basically embraced the popular concept of nu-metal/mallcore here and attempted to merge it with some remnants of their older Thrash style. The result is an oversized collection of confused songs that somehow manage to be both boring and completely unpredictable at the same time. About the only thing positive I can say about this is that the drumming is pretty well done, which leaves basically everything else on here at varying altitudes within the rotten modern music shitter.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say which is more annoying on here, the slightly more restrained variant on Phil Anselmo\u2019s \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d, pseudo-tough guy shouts with a hint of rap influences, or the stagnant guitar lines that wander back and forth between tired early 90s thrash clich\u00e9s and 2 note groove bloopers. This sort of stylistic cognitive dissonance infects most of the better songs on here like \u201cDisciple\u201d and \u201cGod Send Death\u201d, which attempt to kick into a thrash break at points yet only succeed at being a faster version of the Pantera worship going on during the groove sections. By even the most primitive of speed/thrash standards, these songs are extremely redundant, not to mention loaded with uninteresting and unmemorable ideas.\n\nOften any semblance of trying to fake the Thrash style is absent and the most disturbingly awful of mid-tempo, 3 note chug-a-chug-chugging ensues like an army of mask toting nu-metal drag queens. \u201cThreshold\u201d and \u201cHere Comes The Pain\u201d could well go down in history as the most ridiculously groovy and boring songs ever to be put out by a formerly respectable band, mimicking various ideas that you\u2019d sooner hear out of The Deftones or Limp Bizkit than any serious metal band. If the lack of interesting riffs and the really sludgy and sloppy sounding guitar tone don\u2019t immediately drive you away, Araya\u2019s stupid rhythmic vocal antics will probably homeboy you to death in a single listening.\n\nGod and Satan have finally found something that they can agree on, they hate this album, as should any self-respecting fan of this band who loved the pioneering thrash staples that were \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d and \u201cHell Awaits\u201d. I can see some nu-metal scene kids lapping this up like crazy and bragging to their friends about how many guitar solos there are on here, but other than that this doesn\u2019t have any sort of intended audience. I\u2019m sort of stuck between whether I should sigh at this or just silently go about my business as if it doesn\u2019t exist whenever someone mentions this album in a conversation, but unlike Jehovah and Lucifer, I have more important things to do than spending my days hating this album, not to mention that unlike them I don\u2019t have an eternity of time to waste on such things.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on May 2, 2009.\n",
        "\nMost people criticize this album for its Nu-Metal influences\u2026that\u2019s not the problem. The problem is those Slayerisms, which I will get to. This album has more of an industrial metal vibe to it like Fear Factory and Godflesh with trash elements then Nu-Metal. I do give the band credit for trying something new, god forbid that Slayer will ever experiment. The album\u2019s overall tone is very dark and eerie. The artwork is messed up, in a good way. But here are the problems\u2026.\n\nJeff and Kerry\u2019s solos, they have been playing the same dam solo since 1986. Does Slayer believe that melody is lame or something? Look at other extreme metal acts like Entombed, Dismember, & (old) Sepultura\u2026they all have melodic solos in their songs. Is this some type of American thing? An acoustic guitar can actually sound pretty creepy when used right.\n\nTom\u2019s vocals sound like Jerry the \u201cKing\u201d Lawler from the WWE. Since 1994 Tom has performed in a rather comical high pitched scream, which sounds like you are watching a WWE match, with Jeff and Kerry going at it in the ring. I\u2019m not a fan of vocal effects but that is one of the highlights of this album. Look at \u201cIn the Name of God,\u201d the effects in the middle of the song fit the music better, than Tom\u2019s normal vocals. The vocal effects on \u201cScreaming from The Sky\u201d give the album that industrial feel I was referring to. Songs like \u201cPoint\u201d are ruined by the vocals. This song has so much potential before Tom starts singing. This album could have used some spoken word sections or audio clips to add to the atmosphere of the album.\n\nThe slower pace of this album is a highlight. Some of the heaviest metal albums come from slower paces. Ex, \u201cBitter Peace\u201d is the best Slayer opening ever; it\u2019s heavy and grabs your attention with a slow build up on guitars and drums. Nice drums fills and bass lingering in the back ground as the guitars drone off for a bit. This is only the first 1:32 seconds of the song\u2026then goes into Slayer mode.\n\nThis album is downloadable at best. If you want a good Slayer album buy Show No Mercy or South of Heaven.\n",
        "\nLet's pretend this never happened, shall we? We'll pretend this was a bad dream and we'll put Hell Awaits on repeat like the good well intentioned metalheads we are. \n\nUnfortunately it doesn't work that way. God Hates Us All is real, and nothing screams \"SLIPKNOT RIP\" quite like this. For starters, the name of the album is a ripoff of how Slipknot fans call themselves maggots; i.e., hated ones. Of course it's all pretentious, since we all know the oodles of spondulicks both bands make would suggest otherwise. Sure, GHUA puts on a veneer of violence and intimidation, much like a random middle finger thrown by a bunch of joyriding teens at the crossing guard. Intended to display a rude statement of anger, but falling quite short. \n\nMusic that's meant to intimidate never did well in my books, because we all know that the stereotypical metalhead can't be intimidated. I don't mind swearing in music, but swearing for swearing's sake as is done on songs like Exile and Payback comes off as fake as a plastic grille on a cheap mid-80's oldsmobile or plastic sunglasses at a ZZ top concert. Fake, fake, fake, fake. Sure, there are a couple passable songs here, like God Send Death, but nothing even close to the greatness of their early 80's work. The halfway distorted vocals sound mallcore as hell, as well. There's a way to do distorted vocals right (listen to Burzum's Filosofem) and there's a wrong way to do them. God Hates Us All qualifies as the wrong way of doing them. \n\nEverybody knows metal doesn't quite take itself seriously, and it's laughable when metal bands try to get people to take them seriously, as is done here. Making threats to your listeners via the lyrics will always sound silly and ridiculous. We all know you're not gonna smash our heads in, so why the pretentiousness? \n\nOf course you can't completely condemn an album based off of the vocals/lyrics alone. For a \"metal\" album to suck (I use the term loosely here) you need terrible guitar riffs, and God Hates Us All has no dearth of terrible riffs. For instance, the main riff of Bloodline is the kind of shit that guitarists in their first few months of playing come up with. Shit like 0-0-0-0-3-3-3-3-2-2-2-2-1-1-1-1 is pure mallcore tripe, no matter how you phrase it, and the fact that GHUA is all slowed down \"groove\" abominations of riffs as opposed to the swift material of yesteryear doesn't help this one bit. Hanneman and co. must have been suffering from a severe lack of inspiration, because I am completely confounded as to how you can come up with worse shit than this. It's all restrained, low-intensity material here. Nothing like the real necksnappers on their first few albums. \n\nWhat's really sad here is that Slayer were never really that great. Their supposed milestone, Reign In Blood, was merely a streamlined commercial approach to the more violent approaches to thrash, yet God Hates Us All makes Reign In Blood seem like the greatest thrash masterpiece ever by comparison. Yes, God Hates Us All is really that terrible. And the repeated Slipknot comparisons that have been made are not unfounded at all; Kerry King has stated repeatedly that he likes Slipknot and views them as a modern-day influence. Of course, King has backed off from making such statements as of late because it is no longer popular to be a $lipknot ripoff. \n\nSo let's pretend this was a bad dream that never happened, shall we? I'm willing to forgive Slayer, only if they completely abandon this direction. A miscarriage of the highest degree, a real faux paus of metal, and an utter abomination, God Hates Us All will be forever remembered as Slayer's legendary false step, a permanent dent in their credibility.\n",
        "\nWhat a fucking sorry state thrash must be in for this, Death Magnetic, and United Abominations by fellow big 4-ers to be considered comebacks. Slayer aren't back, and just because they're not sucking rap cock like Anthrax are (*shudder*) doesn't mean that this is the metal release to end the torment of the 90's. \n\nSpeaking of the 90's, that decade has been used, over and over again, as an excuse for the extreme suckiness of once great thrash bands. Well, here's a bite of news for you: The nineties have been over for almost a decade. Grunge (the dreaded G-word) has been dead nearly as long as glam \"metal\", and nu-metal is now suffering a similar fate. I can understand a dip in quality during the mid-late nineties as you become unsure of yourself as a band with the advent of Korn's popularity. As a formerly great thrash outfit, you may think your world, your paradigm, has come to an end. If you can't beat em', join em', right? But eventually reason has to prevail. Nu metal, as a genre to be reckoned with, is dead. It has been dead for a while now. Sure, the pioneers of the genre live on, but we don't see new crap notmetal bands popping up left and right anymore. At least Christ Illusion is metal, which is more than I can say about $t. $hit and Anthrax's latest abomination. And songs like Consfearacy and Jihad are actually kinda catchy, even if Araya's voice is long dead. \n\nBut metal doesn't necessarily mean good. It doesn't help that everything that is good about Christ Illusion is merely a retread of better days, and that everything \"new\" or moderately un-hackneyed is the band clinging on to their fellow buddies $hitknot and their fiascos known as Diabolis in Musica and God Hates Us All. This isn't a comeback, because, well, as they say in AA, if nothing changes, nothing changes. Paul Bostaph wasn't the problem, as he has his credentials from Testament, and taking your original drummer back won't solve anything. Bostaph didn't write those terrible, terrible riffs from God Hates Us All, so don't expect any new revelations here. What this really comes off as is a band slowed down with time. There are no neck snappers here ala Chemical Warfare, Hell Awaits, or Piece by Piece. There is no reason to get Christ Illusion if you already have Slayer's first 4 efforts. You're not going to get a reinvention of thrash, to put it mildly. \n\nWhat's really bittersweet about this whole thing is that thrash really isn't dead. Bands like Sodom have carried the torch through the dark times known as the 90's, and just as well, Sodom have made no comebacks either, though for a different reason. See, Sodom never left. Sodom kept on kicking ass all throughout the nineties. Sure, Tapping the Vein wasn't as good as Persecution Mania or Agent Orange, but it still kicked ass. And Sodom's new output like Code Red or M-16 beats Slayer's last 3 efforts into a bloody, broken mess. Yes, the big four of thrash are dead. Death Magnetic was a big letdown ala premature orgasm, and we all know Dave Mustaine wishes he was in a modern rock band instead of Megadeth. But thrash isn't dead, which is why Christ Illusion is unexcusable. \n\nWhat really kills CI is that it still sounds restrained, as if this old ass band is afraid to really go for the jugular like they used to. There's an element of fear to this whole thing; you can't fail if you don't try in the first place. All the riffs are slowed down, the solos are meandering excuses that shame the concept of a guitar solo, and the intensity of the delivery is toned down significantly. It's a step up from God Hates Us All, to be clear on this, but this is hardly a comeback.\n\nThe good news is that if Slayer keeps up on this path, they maybe one day might make a magnum opus worth listening to. They'll make the thrash album to end all thrash albums, putting every last breath of effort into it, so Slayer as a band can rest in peace, their legacy intact, having gone out with a bang instead of a whimper. Sadly, Christ Illusion is not that album, and it looks like fanboys anticipating the second coming will have to wait a few more years. \n\nAs for the rest of us, let's not hold our breath. There is life to be found in thrash metal, and more so, in metal in general. But not here, folks. Not here, not now.\n",
        "\nIt is with a rather odd fit of self-irony that I have to say that this isn\u2019t as bad as it is made out to be. By no standard is this good or even an album that could be described as being enjoyable for those who wanted thrash metal and got stuff like this instead. But if the basis of comparison is albums like Metallica\u2019s \u201cSt. Anger\u201d, Machine Head\u2019s \u201cThe Burning Red\u201d or Sepultura\u2019s \u201cRoots\u201d, this is a superior album. It still contains some elements of the older Slayer that everybody loves, more particularly the one that put out decent music on \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d, albeit in sparse intervals within certain songs. There\u2019s plenty of groove and stagnated chugging that makes \u201cCountdown To Extinction\u201d sound like \u201cDarkness Descends\u201d, but what results is something more along the lines of a \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d or \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d.\n\nUnlike most of the nu-metal brethren of the day who were farting all over the concept of the guitar solo and creating actual riffs to bolster a bare bones arrangement rather than 2-3 note drones with rapped nonsense and loopy studio vocal effects, there is actually an attempt at musical variation and even an aura of technicality. The guitar solos that occur are essentially a slowed down and restrained version of what would ordinarily be going on, almost comparable to what was heard out of Kirk Hammet and Marty Friedman at around this time. The groove sections are naturally annoying insults to the concept of guitar playing, but there are usually brief instrumental breaks that explore the old dissonant harmony work of better days, albeit in a much slower and less catchy capacity.\n\nThere are basically four songs on here that don\u2019t put the concept of metal over a barrel, but even this songs are fairly flawed afterthoughts that might have amounted to B-sides on \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d or \u201cSeasons In The Abyss\u201d. \u201cPerversions Of Pain\u201d and \u201cPoint\u201d are basically full thrash songs and fairly decent, perhaps measuring up to some of the fast works heard on \u201cSeasons\u201d, but also containing breakdown sections that are a little bit too modern sounding. \u201cBitter Piece\u201d also is pretty fast and catchy once it gets going, but you have to wait through about a minute and a half of repetitive monotony to get to it. \u201cScrum\u201d is a little better during the slow sections and throws out a few decent riffs before it starts cooking, and also features the wildest yet shortest lead break on here.\n\nEverything else found on this album falls into two categories, one being really bland groove metal in the mode of Sepultura and Pantera circ 1992-93, the other being the Mallcore drivel of Korn and The Deftones. A good example of the former is found in \u201cScreaming From The Sky\u201d, which is perpetually locked in mid-tempo land but does show a little bit of riff variation within a fairly limited range of ideas. For the latter look no further than the grating, homeboy hat sporting nonsense that is \u201cDeath\u2019s Head\u201d and \u201cLove To Hate\u201d. If you have never experienced pure 3 note groove redundancy with the most poser oriented tough guy yelled crap, this is one of the places to experience, but try not to listen to these songs too many times or your balls might shrink while your pants get baggy.\n\nThe jury is back and the verdict has been rendered, this is a lousy quarter-thrash album that would best be buried in the graveyard of nu-metal gayness. Itunes has made it possible to download individual songs from albums, so anyone looking to hear something that is fairly decent, stick to the 4 songs mentioned in a positive capacity here. The lesson to be learned if you are actually masochistic enough to purchase this entire CD at any price above $2, is that the old clich\u00e9 of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is an utter lie and that anyone who speaks this nonsense should be beaten mercilessly with a wet super shammy.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 24, 2009.\n",
        "\nSlayer essentially joined the ranks of former Thrash glory riders turned persona non grata in the metal community in the late 90s with the release of \u201cDiabolus In Musica\u201d, which was a quintessential manifestation of a nu-metal failure. The band seemed to have been seeking what Anthrax and Megadeth were seeking at around this time, which was the reestablishment of their original fan base. \u201cChrist Illusion\u201d is an attempt at courting their alienated fans, thus it would have succeeded in taking the form of thrash revival album if it didn\u2019t come off as a bit dry and lacking in raw spirit. It goes through the motions musically, throwing in your obligatory fast songs, but also throwing in a few remnants of their 90s deterioration.\n\nA few things that are to the album\u2019s credit include the production, which is well balanced and has a pretty well established bottom end. If going by everything other than the vocals, this would qualify as a slightly more organized version of death/thrash, but naturally the tonal nature of Tom Araya\u2019s yells is in contradiction with this. His vocals are a bit weathered and don\u2019t quite possess the punch that they used to, but they are adequate for the task afforded to him for this album. The lead playing is a little bit tamer than the raging furies of descending chromatic scales and whammy bar gymnastics heard on \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, but again it doesn\u2019t really offend the ears in any way or make one believe that the band is running out of inspiration.\n\nWhere this album truly falls short is in the riff construction and the general lack of darkness to the atmosphere. Many of these songs are plenty fast, but often the guitar work consists of semi-groove sounding fragments that might pass for early speed metal if they were more in line with NWOBHM practices. If the production were a little less low ended and had a little bit more of a mechanical sound to it, about half of this could just as easily be mistaken for a lot of the faster songs heard on Pantera\u2019s \u201cVulgar Display Of Power\u201d and \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d. When the songs get good, they seem to want to resemble \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, but instead come up somewhere in between \u201cSeasons In The Abyss\u201d and \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d. The melodic undertones and evil sounding riff happy epics are nowhere to be found, leaving an album made up of fairly good fast quickies with guitar solos and boring down tempo groove metal.\n\nThings start off well enough for the first couple of songs, but immediately after things start to fall into hit or miss mode. \u201cSkeleton Christ\u201d is one of the most redundant songs I\u2019ve ever heard out of this band, essentially sitting on one repetitive riff for a good while and then simply disguising a slightly less boring variation on the same riff with a fast thrash beat. This pattern repeats on a somewhat less repetitive level with other songs including \u201cEyes Of The Insane\u201d and \u201cBlack Serenade\u201d. Even a lot of the songs that start off really kick ass settle into these really annoying breakdown sections that just steal the energy of the song. The ones that truly remain in the thrash realm such as \u201cConsfearacy\u201d and \u201cFlesh Storm\u201d are solid riff monsters, but even these don\u2019t have the epic or hauntingly evil nature to them that made classics such as \u201cAngel Of Death\u201d and \u201cHell Awaits\u201d the undying classics that they are.\n\nThey say that the road to recovery is a long one, and in Slayer\u2019s case they haven\u2019t reached the end of it here. There is definitely hope for the future, but this album is basically in the same league as Megadeth\u2019s \u201cThe World Needs A Hero\u201d. It\u2019s a metal album and it does contain a lot of Thrash elements, but it falls short in too many areas and hold onto too many bad ideas from the recent past to be a complete recovery. Rabid fans of this band who might like to get their hands on a few good songs are encouraged to look for this in the bargain bin, just calculate what 4 or 5 solid songs are worth to you and go for it. But one thing I will say, at this point and time, these guys are looking better than Metallica and Anthrax currently are.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 24, 2009,\n",
        "\nBefore I wrote this review I decided to look at some of what was written about this record here versus \"Reign In Blood\". I have long been of the belief that Death Metal was the spawn of this album while \"Reign In Blood\" hinted at something more self-important to the band.\n\nSimply stated, this album is evil as fuck. The beginning of this album, with that otherworldly voice and those tortured guitar squeals culminating in what may have been the very first \"growl\" ever put to a metal album, gives a damned good indication of what's to come. Seriously, this album may compel the average listener that, yes giving thy first born to the mighty Satan and drinking goat's blood is a right good idea.\n\nSonically, it is about as close to a perfect mix of raw punk energy and NWOBHM vibes as I've ever come across, with a production that gives the feeling that the band is literally playing from the fiery pits of hell. Tom Araya spits out odes to Satan with the fury of a man being poked in the ass with Satan's very pitchfork and Dave Lombardo literally pounds the life out of his drums (and perhaps a few small children and large animals). Compared to his later work, Lombardo's playing on this record is downright primitive, however I don't recall reading anywhere that ritual sacrifices were graded for style points. As such, Lombardo gives us less fancy fills and footwork in exchange for bludgeonment. And get this, Kerry King's random squealing that he sometimes passes for soloing not only works, but is \"the star\" of this production, as it is pure torture personified.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I talk to younger dudes who all they know about Slayer is \"Reign In Blood\". Yes, the history makers try so hard to pass that record off as revolutionary and ground breaking and \"the album that spawned a genre\" and all that. But those of us know that it was \"Hell Awaits\" that really gave birth to that which would become \"Death Metal\". This is essential listening for anyone who considers themselves a fan of \"death metal\" and, for that matter, anyone who is a fan of extreme music\n",
        "\nThroughout the 1980s, Slayer had been perhaps THE leading force in extreme thrash metal. While their contemporaries like Metallica and Megadeth were gradually streamlining their sound and appealing to major audiences, Slayer seemed to be doing anything to make sure they stood alone. And indeed, they did. While \"Show No Mercy\" and \"Hell Awaits\" were definitely feral, unrelenting, brutal examples of no-frills thrash, \"Reign in Blood\" took those elements into then-unchartered territory. It was a half-hour slab of flesh-ripping sonic torture, dragging you in and pummeling you with a psychotic, bloodthirsty frenzy, clearing out just as fast as it had arrived. Perhaps the band themselves realized they couldn't possibly top the speed and mayhem on \"Reign in Blood\", so 1988's \"South of Heaven\" was confusing to many fans because the songs were, for the most part, slower and more doomy in approach. It's a criminally underrated album, but in my opinion it's one of their highlights. Then came \"Seasons in the Abyss\" in 1990, which was their highest charting album at the time and their best-selling. Many fans have remarked it's kind of a middle ground between the speed of \"Reign\" and the slower, more sinister atmosphere of \"South of Heaven\". That's about as good a description as any.\n\n\"War Ensemble\" starts things off in fine form, with perhaps their most recognized guitar riff next to \"Angel of Death\". This is one of the fastest songs on the album, and one of the longest. Dave Lombardo proves once again why he's regarded as one of the best metal drummers of all time, while Tom Araya shouts and screams over the racket like a demented Gen. Patton barking orders. The soloing by Jeff Hannemann and Kerry King is still plenty atonal and shrieky, but there's also a subtle sense of melody seldom heard before, or after, this album. \"Blood Red\" is a more mid-paced number with some catchy riffs during the chorus. The song concerns the Tiananmen Square massacre in Bejing in 1989, where over a thousand protestors were slaughtered. This album is really where Slayer's current lyrical fixation of tyrannical governments, social decay, and criminal insanity came into full focus, abandoning the Satanism of past albums. \"Spirit in Black\", though, makes a brief return to their early lyrical musings, and this song is also a fast, ripping example of their style of thrash. Tom's vocals are actually intelligible throughout most of the album, making the lyrics easy to follow. \"Expendable Youth\" weaves a tale of adolescents wasting away in inner-city gang violence. Tempo-wise, this is one of their \"slow\" songs although \"slow\" and \"Slayer\" put together really shouldn't mean such a bad thing like a lot of these reviewers seem to think. This isn't surprising for the band, since Los Angeles was pretty much a war zone at the start of the 1990s. It's a stark, blunt depiction of the cruelty and the waste of gang violence, the pointlessness and futility. Next up is \"Dead Skin Mask\", a chilling soliloquy about Ed Gein, the \"Plainsfield Butcher\" of the early 1950s. Tom's vocals take on a detached, ghostly, droning quality which fits the song VERY well... perhaps TOO well. The voiceover at the end of one of Gein's captives lends the song a gruesome, ghastly ambience. A sickening, deathly dirge, and then \"Hallowed Point\" rips wide open, hammering you from all directions. The lyrics are pretty graphic, seemingly a demented tale of a mass murderer, and it's one of those classic Slayer songs you just need to thrash around to.\n\nThe last half of the album to me, for some reason, seems to lose some momentum, but still provide a nice, stiff kick in the teeth. \"Skeletons of Society\" is a post-apocalyptic tale of a world falling to pieces, which at the time, I'm sure, was very appropriate and could easily be set to a montage of news footage of some recent events of today. \"Temptation\" is not exactly a blindingly fast scorcher, but at the same time, not a \"South...\" type funeral march. It juggles the two styles, and due to a studio mistake, Tom tracked two different vocal takes for this song. The first take was supposed to be erased because Kerry had his own idea for how Tom should sing the song, but the first take remained along with Tom's re-recorded vocals and the double-tracked vocal lines create a spooky vibe. \"Born of Fire\" is a short, to-the-point thrasher, marking another return to the Satanic lyrics of Slayer's past. To be honest, this song is forgettable compared to the closing cut, the monstrous, overpowering title track. A doom-laden, foreboding opening section with some haunting, well-played clean guitar lines, conjuring a picture of a deranged killer sitting in his hideout, surrounded by the dismembered bodies of his victims, ripping his own face to shreds and screaming at nothing but the dead audience spread around him. The song is one of Slayer's longest, and definitely their darkest, ever. I read somewhere it was inspired by the crimes of Ted Bundy (who, prior to the album's release, had been executed for the savage murders of some thirty women) but whatever the inspiration was, it's perhaps Slayer's most intricate. haunting song.\n\nThere is a lot of dissention over this album. Some fans love it; others despise it, citing the seeming \"commercial\" edge. I've never been caught up in silly purist bullshit, and I strongly suggest this album for all Slayer fans who are perhaps a bit more open-minded, and for thrash fans in general.\n",
        "\nI shall say right now that Slayer is my favourite band of all time. They are the band that got me into heavy metal. I thought it appropriate for me to review their first album as the first review I write for them. Enough with silly intros, let\u2019s get to the music. The guitar seems to be a logical place to start. \n\nThe guitar on this album is much more melodic than any of their other albums. This album also features the best Slayer solos in my opinion. My favourite Slayer solo is in The Antichrist because it is probably their most melodic solo ever! Metal Storm (the intro to Face the Slayer) has probably the best intro that Slayer has ever written. The album also has some pretty sick riffs, I\u2019ll never forget the riff to Black Magic. The riff to Die by Sword during the solo section is so powerful. Probably the heaviest riff on here. \n\nThe bass.. is there. It just exists and doesn\u2019t do much for the album. It is barely audible for most of the album. Then again, Tom has never been the best bass player around but he works for this album. I never really wanted Tony Choy to be in Slayer.\n\nTalking about Tom. His vocals here are fantastic! This is back when he was young and could still do high pitched screams. His vocals here may not be the most aggressive but they are really good! The chorus to Fight \u2018til Death is amongst the catchiest choruses I\u2019ve ever heard in a Slayer song. \u201cPrepare for attack, your body will burn, endless war, there\u2019s no return, prepare for attack, death will arrive, your orders are clear, no way to hide, fight til death!\u201d \n\nNow for the drumming! Just like every Slayer album the drumming on this one is superb. Dave Lombardo always keeps things interesting. The best drum pattern on here would have to be in The Antichrist. The drumming follows and complements the riff so well it\u2019s insane. The intro to Show No Mercy is practically a high speed drum solo and it demonstrates Dave\u2019s power behind the kit. \n\nOverall this is among the greatest Slayer albums and it showcases some of their most brilliant compositions. Songs like The Antichrist, Metal Storm/Face the Slayer, Black Magic and Tormentor show this band\u2019s amazing song writing capabilities and the brilliance that they are capable of, even if at this point they had not yet found their sound. \n\nHighlights:\n\n-\tThe Antichrist solo\n-\tThe riffs to Die by the Sword and Black Magic\n-\tThe intro to Face the Slayer and Show No Mercy\n-\tThe chorus to The Final Command\n",
        "\nHoly hell, this is good. It's nice to hear a blast of what real old school hardcore sounds like, unlike the sludgy groove metal dirges youngsters associate with the style these days. When I say \"old school\", I mean as in early 1980s, when hardcore was frenzied, furious at the world at large, got in, made its point, and got out inside of a minute and change, all at about 100mph, with ranting screaming vocals and energy to spare. Slayer have always made it clear that this played a big part in their sound and style, and this album is a very convincing run through of some golden oldies from that era. I'd rate it higher if it were an actual Slayer album, since they've not had this kind of energy since the days of \"South of Heaven\" and \"Seasons in the Abyss\" (on the faster numbers from that album anyway), but this is still a really good album anyway.\n\nI give them credit for mostly not choosing obvious bands (other than Minor Threat) from the genre to cover, first of all; not many folks these days remember the likes of D.I., TSOL, Dr. Know, and Verbal Abuse. I could've done with a Bad Brains tune or two, myself, but that's just my preference. I think they were choosing mostly West Coast bands since they're from L.A., and that's perfectly OK, since, again, most of these bands are not known at all to today's youth. \n\nIt's well-produced, too, which makes these songs have even more impact than the original versions in that respect; the guitars have that trademark grungy Slayer tone from back in the day, the drums are perfectly mixed, and the bass is even audible, something you don't hear on a Slayer album. Then again, the bass led the charge much of the time in hardcore's glory days, and Tom Araya gets lots of chances to shine throughout the album with a dirty bass sound that adds healthy amounts of heft and grit to the overall wall of sound, but it' s not so fuzzed out you can't hear what he's doing. And he really beats the crap out of the thing, too. To my surprise, Paul Bostaph earns the award for \"Most Improved\" on this album, as his drum performance here leaves his sloppy showing on \"Divine Intervention\" in the dust in more ways than one. He's far tighter and more intense on this album, and the bits of double kick he throws in fit well and don't come off as gratuitious at all, to my surprise. It doesn't sound as though he's triggered, either, which lends some more credibility to his cause. Hannemann and King, well, you know what to expect from them; tight riffing and their usual noisy, chaotic soloing--not as much in evidence as usual here since hardcore rarely featured lead guitar. \n\nStandouts? Lots of 'em! I really pick Dr. Know's \"Mr. Freeze\" since it features some really nasty and sinster lyrics and Araya lets out the most chilling scream he'd let out in years at the time at the end as he sings \"You try to think with reason/But all you can do is SCREAM!!!\" In fact. his vocals throughout are fantastic, and I can envision him turning bright red, spit flying, veins bulging as he rants away with feverish intensity. Also their blistering run through of D.R.I.'s classic \"Violent Pacification\" is convincing, with Bostaph putting the gas pedal to the floor as he blasts away through the frenetic first half and pounding the hell out of his tom toms in the slower second half. Most everything else on this album is fun and exciting as well. The sole original tunes on here, the Ddamm songs and \"Gemini\" are good as well; the Ddamm songs are fun to scream along to with mindless lyrics and the circle pit part on \"Can't Stand You\" is awesome! \"Gemini\" is the creepiest thing they'd written in years at the time; a slow, simple riff with doomy ambience that really works and a solo that evokes Tony Iommi in his prime.\n\nIf you want to hear what real hardcore from back in the day sounded like, delivered by a band that obviously loves and respects the genre, you could do worse than picking this up. Obviously, going back to hear the originals as well is always a great thing, too, which I highly recommend. But yeah, this is definitely worth picking up for the fun factor and the energy level as well.\n",
        "\nI've seen that the Goths think they know \"evil\" music because they listen to their Marilyn Manson and such. Until they've heard this album, they know nothing.\n\nFirst, I will discuss the lyrics. These aren't the lyrics that poser bands will manipulate to look evil. These lyrics are a dark blend of Satanism, serial killers, death, and gore, and they aren't childish. Just look at the lyrics to \"At Dawn They Sleep\", \"Necrophiliac\", \"Crypts of Eternity\", and the title track and you will see.\n\nThe drumming is superb. Dave Lombardo during this album is one of the only people capable of competing with Gene Hoglan. Not only does he utilize the double-bass efficiently in every song, he has also managed to pull off some fantastic drum rolls. Examples of this can be found throughout \"Necrophiliac\", and also at the end of \"Crypts of Eternity\" (which is one of the best drum solos I've ever heard so far), and the double-bass style drum roll at the end of \"At Dawn They Sleep\". The title track also has a drum roll at the end, which complements the end riff.\n\nSpeaking of riffs, the guitar work on this album is astounding. The riffs are infectious, complex, and creepy, and complement the album's image perfectly (the production also helps with this). At times, they are slow and deadly, and at other times, they are churned out as fast as Araya's vocals. Another pro is that these solos aren't savage wankery; they are, in fact, extremely fast, highly technical, and utilize the whammy bar so that the lead isn't just a few distorted notes, and the solos are nicely scattered throughout every song.\n\nLast, but not least, is the thrash vocal legend, Tom Araya. He is capable of spitting out the lyrics as fast as the drums and as angrily as a machine gun on crack. His voice is also nicely distorted to complement the song, an example being when he says \"Hell Awaits...\" on the title track. His bass can also be heard clearly on a few tracks, and it is very good.\n\nThe production also isn't very bad either. At first, it might sound a little rough, but it actually gives the album its image, which is dark and evil; the production, even though it isn't the greatest, gives a dark and evil feel the guitars, which already sound creepy and intimidating.\n\nAll in all, this is a very excellent album, and all songs, in my opinion, get a 10/10. Therefore, all songs are recommended, especially the haunting \"Hell Awaits\". Again, I would love to see the Gothic cunts of society listen to this without going into hiding.\n\nFuckin' Slayer!\n",
        "\nUsually, thrash metal bands sound better live than on the studio and this record is no exception. As for myself, I'm not a big fan of live recordings, but this one is pretty damn good and an excellent introduction to Slayer, if you don't know them. There are stuff here from their debut, [i]Show No Mercy[/i], from Hell Awaits, from South of Heaven... well, every album they had released, circa 1991, is perfectly represented here on Decade of Aggression. Seasons in the Abyss probably is the most represented album, with lots of tracks out of that album being played on this live recording, especially on the second disk.\n\nSo, we begin with \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, the perfect opener in my opinion. Creepy intro, perfect build-up and then everything explodes, when the pair of guitarists play the fast main riff and Lombardo starts playing that fast beat... Awesome headbangable stuff, I'm not a big Slayer fan, in fact I despise most of their material (they are pretty boring, most of the times, and modern Slayer is just crap), but this tune sounds just killer live. Out of nowhere, during \u201cHell Awaits'\u201d instrumental section, \u201cThe Anti-Christ\u201d kicks in, with its NWOBHM-influenced main riff. This version of the tune sounds much better than the original one, it's a bit slower than the opener but still excellent. There are lots of other thrash classics on the first CD, from the legendary \u201cRaining Blood\u201d, to the midpaced but still heavy as hell \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d, from the epic \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d (probably Slayer's best song, together with the before mentioned \u201cHell Awaits\u201d), to the crushing \u201cAngel of Death\u201d. \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d also deserves a special mention. Almost all of the tunes featured on the first CD are performed flawlessly, except some problems Araya seems to have with his voice (on \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d, for example, he kind of loses his voice during the last part).\n\nThe second CD is a bit of a let-down compared to the first one, since the songs featured on it are infinitely weaker. Still, the ultra-fast \u201cPostomortem\u201d and the classic \u201cMandatory Suicide\u201d deserve to be heard. On the other hand, tracks like \u201cHallowed Point\u201d or \u201cCaptor in Sin\u201d are all quite forgettable and almost useless, if you have already heard the studio versions.\n\nAnother complaint I have with the album is its production. I know, there's no overdubs, but the sound quality could have been a bit (well, much) better. At times, it's almost impossible to hear the guitar riffs and the double-bass drums are too damn low in the mix (hell, it's Lombardo, let me hear his pedals!). Araya's voice could habe been a bit higher in the mix too, but that's a minor issue after all.\n\nSo, a pretty good live album, the first CD is perfect headbangable material, but the second one drags Decade of Aggression down a little bit. Still, nice live recording, excellent for those who want to know who Slayer are.\n\nBest Moments of the CD:\n-Probably, the first part of \u201cHell Awaits\u201d.\n",
        "\nWhen everything seemed to go well for Slayer, came Diabolous in Musica. With the Divine Intervention album, Slayer proved us that they were avoiding the groove/grunge period very well but the hopes of a solid, still thrash metal effort were destroyed by this album, the weakest point in their career. I can say that if it\u2019s even acceptable because after 15 years of music the inspiration can go away for awhile, but the music here is not good\u2026and I must admit it, me, a huge fan of this band. Nothing is perfect and they are human beings too, even if in the previous efforts they looked like (or played like) gods to me. \nI\u2019ve listened to this album a lot of times in the past because I was younger and as a teenager with a low knowledge of metal, I was attracted by anything that sounded heavy and it did to me. By the way, growing up as a guy and as a metal aficionado, I understood that this album had nothing to do with the previous ones. The 90s were a quite bad period for the genres born in the 80s and this is the proof, even because the \u201cnu-metal\u201d was putting the head out and was becoming a popular genre among the young bands. I can\u2019t say that Slayer completely went \u201cnu-metal\u201d but they filled their sound with new elements and the songwriting changed a lot. \n\nThe beginning is not bad at all and it gives you the idea that the band is back again with a furious opus of thrash metal. The introduction to \u201cBitter Peace\u201d and the following up-tempo parts are just blowing. The band is compact, brutal and fast. The production is clear, pounding and truly devastating. Bostaph at the drums is always great and the furious restarts with the fast bass drum parts are very good. Tom\u2019s vocals are always good and angry but some filtrated vocals are a bit weird. At this point I wasn\u2019t worried because everything seemed a continuation of Divine Intervention. \u201cDeath\u2019s Head\u201d shows signs of changes for the more hardcore/punk patterns and guitars parts with sudden doom breaks. The riffs are far simpler than in the past and some effects are actually new in their sound. Everything seems directed in a different way than in the past. Everything is extreme in another direction and this time the first groovy parts are more audible. The atmosphere, anyway, is truly gloom and dark and this is the thing I liked the most. Even the whispered vocals are dark but they are a bit in Slipknot style, so\u2026 \u201cStain of Mind\u201d follows more or less the patterns of the previous song, while the doom atmospheres of \u201cOvert Enemy\u201d and the sludgy riffage are too boring. Tom\u2019s here is terrible and the vocals remind the ones on the following God Hates Us All. \n\nThe riffs are sloppy and the solos have lost that uncontrollable fury of the previous works. The fast parts are better and they avoid me from falling asleep. By the way, even in this part, the thrash metal is just present as a tree in the Sahara. The refrain on \u201cPerversion of Pain\u201d is terrible with the clean vocals but the fast parts are finally what I call thrash metal. The solo too is far better. The riffs on \u201cLove to Hate\u201d are one of the most horrible things ever by this band. They are senseless and without even a hint of power and rage. \u201cDesire\u201d is utterly boring in its purpose to be dark and obsessive. As always, the vocals are shit and the arpeggios are flowing crap. Oh my, what a mountain of shit. \u201cIn The Name of God\u201d makes me laugh and at times I wanna cry too\u2026 here Slayer are almost unrecognizable and completely anonymous in their way of playing. They were born to play thrash and anything different they did they did it bad. No fast parts, no impact, no THRASH, no METAL! This is desolating and going on this album continues in going downhill. The rest of this album isn\u2019t worthy a description. Except for some good riffs on \u201cScrum\u201d, the rest is to throw away. \n\nThey give you the idea that when they decide to play thrash metal, they are still unmatchable but they don\u2019t want to do it in the greatest part of the album. This is definitely the lowest point in their discography and objectively a musical wreck. Ok, if you want to change, do it with a style and this is not the right way. Also the following album would be quite bad but with this one we reached the limits. Unless you are constipated, avoid this album and you\u2019ll live better, for sure.\n",
        "\nDespite being feature on GH3 *shudders*, Raining Blood is the best and most innovative song off of the (almost) same-named album. The riffs are much more innovative than the other songs, and happen to be both catchy and evil-sounding. This, along with the aforementioned appearance, have been the main contribution to this being Slayers most popular song. \n\nBleeding through from Postmortem, RB starts out with, appropriately, the sound of rain. In the background, the guitar provides the dark atmosphere, while Dave Lombardo gives one of his rare thundering, but slow drum-beats. Then, comes in the main riff. This moment is roughly comparable to the opening of Hell Awaits (though not as great), the atmosphere of evil coming from this part really sets the mood in the right place. After that comes some more riffs, not quite so good, or nearly as fitting, but still good nonetheless, after that it goes pretty much into typical Slayer stuff.\n\nOne more thing going for this song, is that Tom Araya doesn't plague it that much with his boring vocal style. When he does come up he's much more tolerable than on the rest of the album, with a venomous voice that does a good, though not great job of fitting the atmosphere of the song.\n\nThe only complaint however, is the mandatory solo by King. I'm not particularly a fan of his style, and there could be a much better way to end the album than ANOTHER one of his solos. That said however, it doesn't ruin the song, and Hannemans riffing still remains excellent. This song is a great starting point for Slayer if you happen to be new to this type of music, and I'd recommend it to a noobie any day.\n",
        "\nWhen I first saw kids at my school with Slayer shirts, I initially blew them off, after all, how good could they be if you their shirts are on kids who listen to Lamb Of God and Trivium? Well, you\u2019d be surprised if you were in the same situation as me, and at the time I hadn\u2019t listened to more thrash than Megadeth and Metallica, so this was totally new to me. About a month later, I had heard a couple songs, and they sounded pretty badass, and the end result was me getting Reign In Blood.\n\nNow, if you know me, you\u2019ll know that I\u2019m not particularly big on what people think the classics are, just what it actually sounds like, and Reign In Blood doesn\u2019t sound like all it\u2019s cracked up to be. This is just a gateway album, introducing people to fast music, and there's very little for a veteran to appreciate. There isn't even enough memorable tracks for a nostalgic replay. \n\nFirst off, Kerry King, the God Of Random-Fret-Solos, sounded good on Show No Mercy, but what happened? (did your balls drop off?) Putting it a bit harshly, King's solos sound more like a swarm of mosquitoes dying horrible deaths than the cries of the damned (which I guess is what he\u2019s going for). And with RIB, his solos are the most overarching problem. They're on every single song (often several of them), and always ends up sounding mediocre, with a slight tinge of wankery becoming apparent when you realize he's actually serious.\n\nAs for the other laurel-sucking pretend god, there's Dave Lombardo. What\u2019s so special about him? Why does he get all the praise he does? I don\u2019t know, because his drum fills are completely average. He has two basic beats, kinda-sorta fast beats, and the more atmospheric pounding and slow drums. Of the two, the latter is much better, but he uses the first almost exclusively. In his defense though, at least he didn\u2019t descend as much as Kerry King did from SNM, and was much better on that album as well as this one.\n\nNow for Tom Araya. Well he doesn\u2019t keep much quality beyond his very first scream on Angel Of Death, save few select screeches after that. His vocals are about as varied as Lombardos drumming, and even more bland than Kings solos. And as to his bass, well, it just plods along, not really doing anything. Speaking of repetitive, the songwriting on this album could be reduced to a simple mathematical formula that likely wouldn\u2019t even require anything above a 6th-grade education to evolve. All of the eight middle tracks sound exactly the same, except for the intro to Criminally Insane (Which is really similar to the intro for Raining Blood)\n\nNow, you\u2019ve probably looked at the score again by now, and you\u2019re wondering why it\u2019s so high when I\u2019m pretty much tearing this album apart. Well, this album can be saved by two things, and the biggest of those is the indescribable quality of thrash that makes you want to headbang and scream until your neck and vocal chords feel like they've been put through a meat grinder. The main thing helping this album with that is that it is FAST, with most of the songs being under 3 minutes. Before you know it, all those 8 filler tracks will be over with, and instead of dragging all the half-assed riffs through the mud, they just briefly touch it. Because of this, the songs are much easier to deal with, and don\u2019t seem nearly so boring.\n\nJeff Hanneman, the lone ranger for quality on here, really shines. Where Kerry King goes crazy-deep into his dumbass style, and Lombardo just does the same thing over and over, Hanneman gets what both are trying to do. He goes kind of technical without going into wankery, and provides the base-line for head banging that usually falls to the drums. Make no mistake, all the quality that\u2019s here is because of Hanneman.\n\nBut really, the way to listen to this album is by not paying attention to it. If you ever think about what they\u2019re actually playing, it will just seem subpar. This album is perfect if you just want some good rhythm to exercise to, and it does extremely well at that. Take it for what it is, but don\u2019t expect something that will reveal anything to you over time, you hear all you need to the very first time.\n\nHighlights: Angel Of Death, Raining Blood\n",
        "\nThe Great Divide is not just a geological schism, it is also the debate among the metal community as to whether Slayer\u2019s seminal Reign in Blood is overrated or not. For the record, I certainly do not believe such although I can see why some might think so. That being said, no matter how great and influential a metal album truly might be, there lie devil\u2019s advocates (against Slayer?) ready to rebut the hype. The road to Hell Awaits was paved with good inventions indeed ala Venom; brick by smoldering brick. \n\nSince we are on the subject of Great Divides, according to this album, skies will be lacerated and destinies dismembered. This is what Reign in Blood is all about and the only thing that matters here. When you switch on this album, apocalypse and inherent evil is the order of darkest day: Frenetic riffs are the fire and storm laden down beats are the brimstone. You need not bring wine and crackers atop this mount of Judgment Day.\n\n\nWhat greeted listeners the first time they heard Reign in Blood? Why the Angel of Death that\u2019s what. Clocking in just under five minutes, Tom Araya\u2019s howling scream in the first thirty seconds is a farewell of sorts from this type of delivery that characterized Show and Hell. And what a great display it is. One of the knocks against later Slayer material was Tom\u2019s abandonment of this Di\u2019Anno and Halford inspired wailing. I would have liked to have heard a Victim of Changes type attempted closing scream to conclude this killer opening track. But Angel of Death is near perfect thrash so I can\u2019t have everything.\n\nThe next song on the death list is the murderous Piece by Piece. The lyrics shouted on this song are a cunt hair too high in the mix compared to the other songs. And while I am splitting hairs, I think Slayer went to their own dictionary because I still have no clue what \u201cmodulistic terror\u201d means. My point being that is how I knew the vocals were slightly a bit in the forefront; that I picked up on that term. But I digress, Slayer are thrash masters not wordsmiths. It says terror and this is a thrash album. That\u2019s good enough for me. \n\nThe reign of terror modulistic or otherwise, continues to rain down most notably with Alter of Sacrifice. The raw opening riff on this one is quite awesome and I have heard some bands use it since. Every time I hear it I nod to myself that royalties should be thrown to Slayer. My guess is that Jeff Hanneman probably used a passive pickup to give it that raw, hardcore sound. This song is my favorite on the album. Dave Lombardo has some wicked blast beats here and Araya channels Cronos especially when he shouts \u201cPraise hail Satan!!\u201d and \u201cendlessly searching for salvation!\u201d I was left waiting for the Venom frontman to cameo \u201cThat was good. That was real good!\u201d\n\nLet us skip down to the final track that is Rain in Blood. The soaring, screeching guitars of Hanneman and King that are heard along with the thunder couldn\u2019t be more brilliant to evoke the epic dread that awaits us here. The famous riff that opens the song needs no introduction. It is of course legendary. What does get overlooked at the start of the riffage is Tom Araya\u2019s bass. What I heard was a masterful beat that seemed like pulsated drone. While Tom will never be mentioned in the same breath as four-string metallers like Steve Harris and Cliff Burton, I always thought he was underrated in light of the speed that Slayer\u2019s metal traveled. I picked up on his syncopation underneath the guitars and it added to my appreciation for this song even more. Lombardo\u2019s blast beats at 1:09 to 1:22 are a clinic for the style that other thrash drummers could only begin to emulate. That Slayer lost their luster after Dave departed is no coincidence. \n\n\nNineteen eighty-six was a banner year for thrash apparently. If nothing else, metalheads had options of which new thrash record to buy. That other \u201cthrash\u201d band released a Muppets album and \u2018Deth sold Peace which was no push over. But it was Slayer who could bring the blood and brutality if you demanded your American thrash in extremes. Reign in Blood was tailored to be played live as if it was one headbanging assault. Blood would be spewed at the front rows like watermelons at a Gallagher show. \n\nR.I.B is not a flawless thrash album. Some of the middle tracks might have that samey sound and the Brian Slagel production grit is sorely missed sometimes but I would be hard pressed to find a metalhead who didn\u2019t value the contribution that it made on thrash. The divide is not as great on that point.\n",
        "\nSlayer are unquestionably my favourite band ever and as a great fan I must admit that this album is the last good one in their discography before the last Christ Illusion. I\u2019m not one of those who are completely narrow-minded towards their favourite band, insisting on the fact that they never released bad efforts. Diabolous In Musica was mallcorish and quite bad for the songs and God Hates Us All was a bit better for the songs but it had a horrible, artificial production. \n\nAnyway, there had a lot of expectations for this album, the very first one after the band\u2019s split with Lombardo. The replacement was Paul Bostaph and despite all the criticisms, he\u2019s a really good drummer. The main point is to erase the memory of Lombardo and conquer a small slice of the fan\u2019s heart. At the beginning he was a bit criticised and that\u2019s normal when you must replace a monster like Lombardo and take his burning seat behind the drums but at the end everybody understood and praised his style, brutality, passion and heaviness. Tom Araya once said that he is like a machine: you charge it and it goes until the end with no hesitations and I believe that it\u2019s true also in the live gigs. He has always been a professional guy.\n\nTalking about this album, the thrash metal period was definitely in crises and almost every band started to play groove thrash, at least the ones that survived but Slayer kept up the thrash metal massacre and released this Divine Intervention that could be easily considered a return to extreme after a more dry (for ideas) and less angry Season In The Abyss that was not the example of a band in perfect form. Maybe the four years were good for the band to get well again. Anyway, I really admire Slayer in this case because here we can see the right attitude of a band that never left the thrash path even during the grunge or alternative metal period.\n\nI think that I admire more this album than Reign In Blood because here Slayer really demonstrated the balls even if the album is not perfect, but the will is what matters. The band itself has grown a lot since the early days and now the members reached a good level of technique. The tracks sound more or less a way between South Of Heaven and Reign In Blood, so we can meet hyper fast ones and darker, slower others. The massacre starts with the drums intro to \u201cKilling Field\u201d and the guitars soon enter the sound to create a massive wall of heaviness. No modernism, no melody but pure violence. Here Slayer are very clear in their message to the fans: we are back and fuck the trends. We still thrash hard. \n\nThe power of the new drummer is clear to anyone and with the following \u201cSex, Murder, Art\u201d we go back to the 80s for speed and nastiness. Here Bostaph is inhuman while \u201cFictional Reality\u201d is more mid paced but without the tired mood of the past released. The band is again vicious and some darker passages of the guitars are really good and well exalted by a truly pounding and clear production that puts in evidence all the instruments and give a vigorous sound to the axes. After, it\u2019s time for \u201cDittohead\u201d to break in with its massive burden of hardcore influences and neverending up tempo sections. The solo by King is, as always, devastating and truly thrash. \n\nAlso Tom\u2019s vocals seem to be more pissed off and they re-conquered a lost brutality. His work on this album is very good but the bass is unfortunately not so audible. We go on with the title track that is a natural continuation of tracks like \u201cSpill The Blood\u201d and \u201cSeason In The Abyss\u201d but this time with a more angry approach. The following \u201cCircle of Beliefs\u201d features four brutal, amazing, tremolo picking solos in four minutes of blasting power demonstration. The band is compact and seems a bulldozer that no one is able to stop. The fast sections of \u201cSS-3\u201d are amazing and the solos are just the pure inserts of insanity to an already excellent song, also during the first part that features galloping riffs and semi mid paced tempo. \n\n\u201cSerenity In Murder\u201d is total mosh for the up tempo parts while it\u2019s also able to be intense during the \u201ccalmer\u201d parts. Surely the vocals\u2019 artificial parts could be avoided because they are a bit annoying and naff. \u201c213\u201d is again a good break to the continue violence, showing good arpeggios and great dark atmospheres. Here they pointed more on the mid paced patterns and the last \u201cMind Control\u201d is remarkable also for the catchy parts and the guitars duets that go along with the fury of a band that has found again the strength to put out really brutal stuff. Unfortunately, this album is just an isolated case in this sense and I wished that the following Diabolous In Musica could have sounded like this. \n\nComing to the end, I just want to recommend this album to those who were let down by Season In The Abyss because here the band is far more compact and brutal.\n",
        "\nWell, I'll admit, when this album comes up the word that comes to mind is \"overrated.\" When I use that word, it's usually a thinly veiled disparagement of whatever I'm talking about. What I'm usually saying is \"I think it sucks but I don't want to be a dick about it.\" This isn't the case with this album. Sure, it's good, but when I want thrash metal I usually look elsewhere... so I'm perplexed as to why so many people hail this as a seminal, if not the best, thrash metal album, and as Slayer's crowning achievement. What, better than Show No Mercy? Haunting the Chapel? Hell Awaits??\n\nPerhaps it's my bias against major label releases, but this being Slayer's major label debut, I think it's a perfect example for justifying this bias somewhat. Reign In Blood is Slayer's shortest album (without the bonus tracks), so if you deduced that it's their shortest album, you'd be correct. It is also their simplest, most watered-down release to date (they got worse, but this one is still good). Their first two albums are full of great moments, and basically that's what make them superior, they just have more moments. Moments that make you bang your head, play some air guitar, punch a baby, you know... those moments. There are more rhythm changes and more complex song structures that are impressive as hell. Take \"Die By the Sword\", \"The Antichrist\", or \"Hell Awaits\", they just have those crunching, menacing riffs that either lead up to or provide an interlude for the relentlessly fast verses. The false ending on \"Praise of Death\", and the following surprise of the band starting up again will literally make you jump. Then there are solo sections thrown throughout. They're impressive solos that haven't aged a bit, shredding and wailing but still intricate and tasteful.\n\nNow on to Reign in Blood. The opener, \"Angel of Death\" (8/10), shows promise. Gruesome, dark lyrics spat out... check... fast, menacing riffs... check... thrashing, headbang-inducing drums... check... chugging, slower-paced bridge... check... harmonizing guitars, check... oh, but what the hell is that solo? Yes folks, that's Kerry King doing some mindless wanking that adds nothing to the song and makes you wish they'd just assign him to rhythm guitar. Now, don't get me wrong, I like atonal guitar madness, but this is pathetic. The double bass saves the day as the song ends, and you are left somewhat satisfied and hungry for more.\n\nIf you're hungry for more of Kerry King's awful excuses for guitar solos then you'll be satisfied... they butcher just about everything Hanneman does with his decent solos, and they usually come after Hanneman's in the song! Blah. If you want more songs on the caliber of Angel of Death with mroe than just verse/chorus/bridge structure, you'll have to wait till the LAST song, \"Raining Blood\". That's right folks, the rest of the songs are usually based off one riff for the verse, one for the chorus, one for the bridge and... well, that's it! If the tempo changes at all, it's only once during the bridge. A good example would be the song \"Necrophobic\" (6/10), which is actually made worse by its speed... and I generally like fast music!\n\nThe lyrics (8.5/10) are the one place where this album is on par with their previous works. They are consistently evil, mostly being about gore or blasphemy, stuff that made the kids apeshit back in the 80s. I doubt you will find any music on MTV today that will give you a vocabulary on this level (which is the level most of you should be at... no wonder so many MTVtards can't spell) or have six-syllable words. They even cross over to something real and political in their lyrics to an extent in the song \"Jesus Saves\" (7/10), critcizing those who have their nose in their Bible and don't live in the real world.\n\nI know I've spent a lot of space bashing this album, but really it's still good. It's a perfect starting place for getting into thrash metal, and the songs \"Angel of Death\" and \"Raining Blood\" are fantastic. Unfortunately my admiration for the album is a lot lower than most peoples' because I heard this album after Hell Awaits and Show No Mercy (since this is Slayer's most popular album, most people hear Reign In Blood first). So this album has my recommendation, check it out if you want to bang your head and scream... for the first time. If you're looking for the next step, do not go to anything Slayer did after this! Wrong Way! Turn around! Check out their first two albums, and then all the bands that were influenced by Slayer's brutal thrashing and took it to the next level... Possessed, Destruction, Morbid Angel, Exodus to name a few. Thrash on!\n\nNote: I apologize if some parts of this review seemed a bit patronizing, but I originally wrote it for a bunch of mallcore kids who were curious about Slayer.\n",
        "\nIf there is one position that a thrash fan would never like to be put in, it is a state of cognitive dissonance between what he personally enjoys and what the scene may see as inferior material. Although not quite as strict in its limited stylistic evolution as black metal, there are certain avenues that tend to be unacceptable in thrash metal quarters, and slowing down and utilizing groove more often than in a few sporadic changeup sections tends to fall into that. But there is a fine line between what constitutes all out groove metal in all of its dim witted majesty, it\u2019s mostly poor panhandling half-thrash predecessor, and what is instead a better fit of catchiness and aggression than what is normally accepted as standard.\n\nThere\u2019s this bandwagon mentality that tends to accompany either absolutely loving or loathing this release, because there isn\u2019t really anything on here that is offensive or boring, nor is there any fits of unfettered speed and rage. The production, the riff collection, the vocal delivery, and every thing else is an even match of the fast paced Slayer that pushed the boundaries in the mid-80s and the seasoned discipline of a soldier. The mixing quality is just a tiny bit short of the extremely polished sound of Metallica\u2019s self-titled, while the lead guitar tracking is as crystal clear as the glass door of an unused shower, and the bass being about an inaudible as was the case on Metallica\u2019s \u201cAnd Justice For All\u201d.\n\nThe solos themselves are the overall highlight if you\u2019re looking for something that breaks out of the solid arrangement category and represents the more out-of-control side that Slayer was better known from earlier in their career. Hanneman and King dish out the usual neo-tonal smatterings of rapid scale ascensions and 3 and 4 note clusters and sequenced patterns, which negotiate this cleaner cut version of the band well when considering how their style was originally crafted for a much more extreme sound. Even when things slow down the leads somehow manage to maintain their extreme edge, serving up a better version of the half-thrash atmosphere than what was encountered a couple years later.\n\nWhen the songs are faster and closer to the Reign in Blood/Hell Awaits sound, everything manages to maintain a solidly good to exciting ratio. If there is a best of the fast paced thrashers it\u2019s \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d, which is almost a more compact and controlled version of \u201cHell Awaits\u201d meets a more discernable version of \u201cAngel of Death\u201d. The structure is a little more of a methodical fast to slow and back to fast thrasher than the epic riff machines it sounds similar to, but it gets the job done nicely. \u201cHollowed Point\u201d and \u201cBorn of Fire\u201d reach the closest to the bash your best friend\u2019s head in with a shovel, vomit on the masses brand of speedy thrash that most in the scene eat up, but are constructed much more symmetrical riff and lead break wise than the pre-South of Heaven material. Everything else in the fast category tends to fall into a middle ground between these two extremes, and consequently don\u2019t stick out quite as much.\n\nThe slower material gets a little bit mixed, but nothing really crosses over into being the brain killing, chug-a-chug tribal groove that dominated the mid to late 90s. \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d and \u201cExpendable Youth\u201d are a little too slow and not quite as interesting as the bulk of South of Heaven\u2019s parallel material. The vocal delivery on the former is a little bit awkward, and the spoken section is more silly than scary, but the music itself stays interesting. \u201cSkeletons of Society\u201d is probably the simplest and most groove-like of all the individual songs on here, but it also proves to be the most fun and head nod worthy. If you don\u2019t like simplistic riff work and a catchy chorus, it will obviously not appeal to you, but if we have nothing but thrashers from start to finish the intended effect tends to diminish quickly.\n\nAs is usually the case on a good Slayer album, most of the greatest ideas are reserved for the title track. Instead of a fairly repetitive doom riff that sounds like a slow version of \u201cReign in Blood\u201d (South of Heaven), the intro has this dark atmospheric quality that sounds middle-eastern, but with this almost Southern sounding slow riff superimposed upon it. When it kicks into the main riff it takes on a heavier mid-tempo character but with an underlying epic feel. The chorus is extremely memorable and occurs with the same regularity as your typically structured song. What it may lack in total numbers of riffs it makes up for with a perfect execution, as Tom Araya gets about as close to melodic singing as he has ever gotten. The lyrics are also extremely progressive and intellectual in comparison to past work, taking a sort of philosophical approach that matches up with similar progressive death/thrash albums of the time such as Death\u2019s \u201cHuman\u201d and Darkthrone\u2019s \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d.\n\nAs far as the reputation that this album has gotten over the past 18 years or so, everyone opining on it tends to sound like a seasoned critic yet misses the mark entirely on this album. It isn\u2019t the poison groove pill that many think it is, nor is it quite a classic in the same vein as \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d or \u201cHell Awaits\u201d. It\u2019s sort of a compromise between those two contrasting eras of Slayer with some very limited modern elements. There comes a time where you either let a collective misconception of this album\u2019s nature based on the time of it\u2019s release and what was going on around it prevent you from enjoying it, or you simply tune out all the chatter and let your own ears be the judge of things. If you choose the latter, you will likely find yourself enjoying this as much as most other top tier thrash metal releases.\n",
        "\nRaining Blood is Slayer\u2019s most famous track of all time. This was the last track of their breakthrough album \u201cReign In Blood\u201d. Slayer is a band that has good riffs but equally bad solos. Mindless, actually one could say. I love thrash but I am not going to mindlessly orgasm on every track that is made even if its by thrash giants Slayer themselves.\n\nThe track which is a continuation off the track \"Postmortem\" starts of with the signature Bay Area thrash style intro (drums and guitars starting simultaneously and the vocals joining in shortly after). This continues for around 50 seconds and then it suddenly stops. The sound of rain pouring can be heard for around 30 seconds and then comes Slayer if not thrash at its peak. The effect if rain pouring is shattered by Lombardo blasting away at his drums and Kerry as well as Jeff building up the intro of probably the riff that is thrash metal at its best. This riff is extremely fast paced and is indescribable. It\u2019s hard to believe that this is the product of the same band, which had made this extremely boring track (up till now). The riff continues for a few seconds and just when the band manages to build up this atmosphere, which they have never been able to create, their weak point once again creeps in. The solos. One just cannot help but frustrated by this tiny ordeal. The good thing is the solo is quite short and the riff, which I talked about a few lines back, starts once again. First at a slower tempo but once again hitting it\u2019s max during the chorus during which Araya sounds surprisingly good. But once again, yes again the soloing ruins it. The solos continue but then all of a sudden it stops, right in the middle of a solo and it seems the song has an abrupt ending but no, that\u2019s not the case. Once gain you can hear that effect of rain pouring and this continues for a minute.\n\nThis track could have been so much better if it started straight from the part where the build up to the riff starts and if they removed the part after the chorus of the track. This is exactly what another band, Vader did while covering this track in their \u201cLead Us EP\u201d and I the cover tons more than the original version. It\u2019s simply just because of the riff that Kerry came up with is the reason why I am giving this track 50%. If it weren\u2019t for the riff, this track wouldn\u2019t have gotten more than 20% in my book.\n",
        "\nSlayer. The name says it all. Something that's dark, fast, sharp, aggressive and with intent to kill. The band couldn't have picked a better name...\n\n1986. Pleasure to Kill, Darkness Descends, Master of Puppets, Peace Sells... But Who's Buying?, only to name a few, were massive albums that marked 1986 as thrash metal's golden hour. And where does Reign in Blood come in here? The anwser is right at the very top.\n\nThe rhythm section: Dave Lombardo delivers. From the machine gun-like double bass part of Angel of Death to the pounding toms of Raining Blood, this guy applies so much force to his playing that it's practically inhuman. Lombardo's frantic, breakneck style fits this album perfectly. Tom Araya's bass is very silent (in fact, the only part of the album where the bass would be audible- the bass intro to Piece By Piece- was ommited from the final product), yet that isn't anything new or shocking by thrash metal standards. The bass lines just follow the guitar riffs anyway, so we're not missing out on much here.\n\nGuitars: The guitar work on this album is quite admirable. Your ears bleed as Hanneman and King belt out note by note, power chord by power chord and lead by lead. Whammy bar dive-bombs simulate dropping bombs, horrible whails mimic the cries of lost souls begging for their lives, and the frantically shredded solos only add to the general atmosphere of chaos and discord the album projects. However, it must be made clear that no mistakes were made here. Each note precisely on time, each insane solo played perfectly. Hanneman and King successfully defy all music theory through the album, having received little-to-no formal musical training (I do remember King mentioning somewhere that he used to have a guitar teacher, with whom he played in a band as well).\n\nThe vocals are frantic, horrifying screams spat out at dazzling speeds. From the opening shriek in Angel of Death to Raining Blood's last enfuriated line, Tom Araya manages to retain both the endurance and the fury of an elephant.\n\nNext up is the songwriting. The songs are short, especially in comparison to the slightly progressive Hell Awaits. We all know the story when long-time Slayer producer Rick Rubin heard the album and let the band know that it clocked in at around 25 minutes. Shocked, the band asked the producer if they should write more songs. Rubin replied that as long as they have 10 songs, they have an album. A lot of people find this record to be much too short, I, on the other hand, find its length to be perfect. The songs are all very memorable, since it's possible to discern the lyrics pretty much without the booklet. The riffs are also very memorable and very easy to make out, thanks to Rick Rubin's phenomenal production. The lyrics aren't exactly innovative for today's standards, however back in '86 singing about Nazi horrors, dismemberment, insanity, etc. and graphically depicting it within one's lyrics was pretty shocking stuff.\n\nSo, the conclusion: Reign in Blood is definitely a masterpiece, one of thrash metal's best offerings to date and a prime representation of a young band in their golden hour. The songwriting is stellar, and if the riffs weren't so fast you could actually hum along to them. The band members' performance is perfect and the production is very clear. All this is good, but what makes this album so great?\n\nWell, I ask you... How many times did you feel like listening to some good extreme metal to get your day started, something to help you get through work? And how many times did you start listening to an album when you realized all of a sudden that you have to be at work in ten minutes and at the same time felt annoyed that you had to stop listening mid-album? This problem does not exist with Reign in Blood, since it's possible to listen to it in its entirety without missing a minute of work/school while still getting a major kick out of it. Yes my friends, that's the beauty of it. I definitely recommend this if you're new to metal in general, and if you're an aspiring thrash/death metaller, this is the first thing you should purchase.\n",
        "\nI purchased this DVD way back when I first got into metal. At the time I was obsessed with Slayer (and na\u00efve, might I add) and thus I was completely happy upon viewing it.\n\nAs time has gone on however, I\u2019ve matured and not only listened to much more metal, but also have had the opportunity to watch plenty of metal DVDs. Looking back on War at the Warfield, I can\u2019t say the same thing now as when I first viewed the DVD. While I am still a huge Slayer fan, I\u2019ve come to realize their DVDs are not exactly great. In fact, they\u2019re far from it.\n\nThe one thing that stands out to me about War at the Warfield is the fan section. Holy shit it\u2019s hilarious. I mean, I consider myself to be a big Slayer fan, but I\u2019ll be fucked if I ever act like such a ridiculous moron as the people did on the DVD. I know they selected that footage for the very reason that it\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d and that it will sell better and garner the most reaction, but man, I don\u2019t know how some people can be so\u2026 ridiculous, especially over a BAND; it\u2019s the one word that continually enters my mind when I think of those people. Anyway, the fan section is definitely funny and I always make a point to watch it when I play the DVD to remind myself that no matter how much I love metal, I\u2019ll never be as ridiculous as those people.\n\nThe DVD lacks special features. It\u2019s Slayer\u2019s first DVD and they don\u2019t have much content, which I always find disappointing. I\u2019d like to think a band such as Slayer would have a large collection of material from their years of touring and random appearances. I understand they were releasing Soundtrack to the Apocalypse a few months later and included various and rare footage with that, but they could\u2019ve included some more stuff on this release. The music video is a nice addition, but so what? It\u2019s nothing special and even if it was, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to save the DVD. The interview is alright but again nothing special. It would\u2019ve been a lot better if other interviews were included, or if it was longer.\n\nFor the most part, to me the DVD seems to function primarily as a tool to sell God Hates Us All, probably because sales were diminishing two years later, and to hype up the tour. I purchased the disc after I bought the CD, and I didn\u2019t see Slayer in concert (that year, anyway).\n\nNow onto the meat of the DVD: the concert. It was my first time seeing Slayer play live, even before actually seeing them live. My initial reaction of course at the time was that it was awesome, and to this day my opinion has only slightly changed. Tom\u2019s voice has always been a thing for me; it\u2019s degraded quite a bit over the years, and I understand that it\u2019s inevitable, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t happen. His vocals aren\u2019t his worse here (his vocal performance in London, Ontario was pretty brutal), but I\u2019ve heard better from relatively the same time period. When they opened for Judas Priest at the Molson Amphitheatre in July 2004, Tom\u2019s voice sounded surprisingly good.\n\nThe setlist is awesome. I dislike the abundance of songs from God Hates Us All, but I understand why they are there. It\u2019s nice to see some other songs from the \u201cforgotten\u201d albums of Slayer, namely Dittohead and Stain of Mind. I happen to quite enjoy Diabolus in Musica and Stain of Mind is one of my favourite songs from that album, so seeing it on the setlist is a plus. It would have been nicer if they included more from Show No Mercy, but they don\u2019t play a lot of songs from that album, even nowadays. Die by the Sword is a sweet song, but Black Magic would have been better. All the \u201cmust haves\u201d are there as usual, such as Mandatory Suicide, Seasons in the Abyss, Captor of Sin, etc., and of course they finish with Angel of Death.\n\nThe sound quality is pretty good, and it\u2019s nice the concert is in 5.1 surround sound, which I always take advantage of (and it makes a difference).\n\nIn the end there\u2019s nothing incredibly redeeming about this DVD. The fan section is worth a few good laughs, and the live performance contributes nicely. Aside from that that though, there\u2019s nothing else worth watching. The music video can be downloaded in five minutes, and probably the interview too, or just go to Youtube.\n\nIf you\u2019re a huge Slayer fan I recommend buying this. Otherwise I suggest passing this up for something with more value.\n",
        "\nFor such a loud and fast album with so many riffs, 'Seasons In The Abyss' sure is a boring one. This is the first time I've had an entire album full of songs I remember very well, not because they're actually good, but just because they're designed to be memorable. I actually find the benighted later albums of Slayer to be more interesting than this; at least they're less middle-of-the-road. I hate mediocre things much more than I do genuinely bad ones, so this album gets a lot of ire from me.\n\nSo there's two songs on this album: fast, thrashy ones, and slower, more melodic ones. Neither category is very exciting, particularly when the latter ones are so openly groove-laden and overtly accessible. 'Dead Skin Mask' is the most typically scorned for its fairly dumb main riff and silly vocal performance, but I think 'Skeletons Of Society' is even more fundamentally awkward and openly unnecessary. The title track is probably the best song on here, probably because it sounds like it came from earlier in the band's career, to some degree. It's at least moderately entertaining, most of all in the enjoyable if somewhat cheesy chorus.\n\nThe fast songs all just run together. 'War Ensemble' is a kind of Slayer classic, though I'm not sure why: it's just a collection of fast riffs and drumming and vocals with no real substance to it. It's just a list of thrash conventions, really. I like 'Spirit In Black', 'Hallowed Point', and 'Born Of Fire'; they more or less sound aggressive and convincing. But then there's tracks like 'Expendable Youth' which are just complete abortions from top to bottom, or 'Temptation' which isn't offensive but just fizzles out lamely. 'Blood Red' is filler. Oh wait, it looks like that's all the tracks. There's little content here. Four out of ten tracks are worth listening to. Not a very good ratio by Slayer standards.\n\nProduction and playing are adequate if unexceptional, as you would expect.\n\nHonestly, I just expect more from the band, and if they can't deliver more, I expect much, much less. This is an inoffensive album which occasionally gets my head nodding, but apart from that, doesn't really move me in any way. It's still Slayer; there's a lot of atonal solos, 'classic' thrash riffing (though it seems more by-the-numbers and uneventful than ever), and Araya screams and shouts a lot and supposedly plays bass though you couldn't tell it from the mix. If you particularly care a great deal about Slayer, get it, otherwise, Slayer is dead, 'Reign In Blood' is the best album ever because it's the fastest, Slaaaaayeeeer, 'Hell Awaits' was better, etc.\n",
        "\nI love Slayer. I love everything about Slayer. And I love their 1984 EP \"Haunting The Chapel\" more than anything in their entire catalogue. \"Haunting The Chapel\" defines what thrash metal is and what thrash metal should be. Every riff, every beat, and every lyric Slayer spill out of their unholy sound makes \"Haunting The Chapel\" the quintessential thrash metal release, EP or otherwise.\n\nMusically Slayer has never sounded so solid as they do on this EP. There's more aggression here than on the 1986 classic \"Reign In Blood\" and that speaks volumes for itself. Every track on this EP has become a staple of Slayer live sets even to this day. The opening riff to Chemical Warfare may be one of the most recognizable riffs in thrash history.\n\nLyrically \"Haunting The Chapel\" marks new ground for Slayer. \"Show No Mercy\" was evil and dark in its own right but with the title track \"Haunting The Chapel\" Slayer directly attack Christianity, a theme that has continued in thrash and death metal to this day. The lyrics are evil, intense, and graphic but would you expect any less? What\u2019s more is that they are intelligent, well written, lyrics. Some of the lyrics seem to have an actual rhyme scheme and pattern. Amazing considering the cacophony of sound going one while Tom Araya belts out the vocals.\n\nKerry King and Jeff Hanneman prove again that they are the undisputed thrash gods of guitar. Trading leads and double riffs are a common listen throughout the EP. The riffs presented are edgy, raw, and filled with aggression. A must for thrash.\n\nOn the skins we find Dave Lombardo, again showing his prowess for all things thrash. His complex and intense drumming on \"Captor Of Sin\" and \"Haunting The Chapel\" in particularly are enough to prove his worth as a drummer of metal music. \n\nIt may seem over the top, all this praise about a single four track EP but this is no ordinary EP. This is Slayer. This is true thrash metal.\n",
        "\nWhen someone puts a thrash album on the player, there isn\u2019t really any question about what kind of metal you are listening to, it\u2019s pretty much as obvious as the night being dark. Differentiating between bands is mostly accomplished through the ratio of punk to NWOBHM influences, the quality of the singer\u2019s voice, and the ambitiousness of the songwriting. But as far as I am concerned, what makes a thrash album truly great is how memorable it is, from start to finish. Can a band actually walk a line between the hyper speed shredding and riffing, the rapid paced change-ups and shouted syllables, and still present something that can be recalled after the last track gives way to silence?\n\nIn the case of Slayer, memorable songwriting hasn\u2019t been much of a problem, with the notable exception of this particular album. The hype around \u201cReign in Blood\u201d is for obvious reasons, since for 1986 this was the most brutally fast, lyrically profane, yet musically ambitious releases to ever crack the Billboard top 200. The band successfully crams about 100 riffs into just under 30 minutes of pure evil, often in small doses that would seem more fitting to the likes of S.O.D. and Suicidal Tendencies. However, in this respect this album\u2019s greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. Although heavily influential in the death metal genre and widely heralded as a pinnacle of the thrash genre, as an album it doesn\u2019t have the staying power to earn the lavish praise that most still attribute to it.\n\nWith four notable exceptions, I can not recall any of the songs on here unless I\u2019ve heard it within 10 minutes before hand, and only if I just listened to that one song. Everything between the opening track and the closing track tends to run together because of a uniform approach to songwriting, an evil yet unvaried vocal delivery, and riffs and solos that do more to leave murky impressions rather than brand themselves in the memory. When I play this album from start to finish, I\u2019m into it the whole time with the horns in the air, but the minute it\u2019s over I immediately begin to forget most of what I\u2019ve heard, particularly the middle part of the album.\n\nThe opening track \u201cAngel of Death\u201d is the obvious winner in just about every department. As a thrash song it balances mid-tempo grooves and high speed thrills the most even-handedly, features some ugly yet perfectly executed vocals, and plenty of riffs for the ear drums to absorb. The lyrics got the band into some trouble with the suits due to their extremely graphic depiction of the works of Josef Mengele in the Auschwitz death camp, although in rekindling those horrors so well I\u2019d argue that the band did a favor to everyone who would be a future target of such evil by getting people to talk about it and condemn it. The title track and album closer \u201cRaining Blood\u201d rides a very close second, featuring one of the most ridiculously fast riffs I\u2019ve ever heard, one that is still difficult to play in time after more than 6 years of being able to do so.\n\nUnfortunately in between these two monumental songs is a good deal of 1 dimensional punk leaning speed/thrash that individually clock in quite short, yet might as well be one massive 20 minute song. The two standouts are \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d and \u201cCriminally Insane\u201d because they have relatively clear-cut structures and don\u2019t try to cram 20 different riffs and 10 verses into 2 minutes. They\u2019re quite compact; they do change up quite a lot in spite of being short in length, but they do stand out from the rest. The other songs are not very memorable, but definitely fun while being listened to. \u201cJesus Saves\u201d suffers from trying to cram too many words into a verse and succeeds in making one appreciate the value of a lyric sheet. Tom Araya does his best to clearly sound out each word, but it goes so fast that all you get is \u201cblah, blah, blah, blah\u201d which resolves to a resounding \u201cJESUS SAVES!!!\u201d, definitely not my first pick for sing along material.\n\nBasically after 6 years of owning this album I can say that it is a good album, above average by both metal and thrash standards, but it\u2019s not something that I\u2019d call amazing or genre defining. \u201cHell Awaits\u201d and \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d both bring a lot more to the table than this musically and deserve at least as much attention as this. If by some strange set of circumstances you own either or both of those albums and not this one, it is worth getting, although I\u2019d recommend getting the re-issue so you can at least get more than 30 minutes of material for your hard earned money.\n",
        "\nSlayer\u2019s debut is still regarded as a milestone for a new way of doing metal. This new way was (and still is) the \u201cthrash metal\u201d. This album is, along with \u201cKill \u2018em All\u201d, \u201cKilling is My Business\u2026And My Business Is Good\u201d and \u201cBonded By Blood\u201d, an important sign of the new growing scene. Even if the influences of the heavy metal are still well displayed, this album is incredible for violence and speed. The music is truly EVIL and some face paintings utilized by the members, along with the inverted crosses, created a sort of mystery the surrounded the band in that period. I can only imagine those families that burned \u201cThe Number Of The Beast\u201d LPs, because it was \u201csatanic music\u201d, when they found this album in their son\u2019s metal collection. \n\nThis band, grown up with Venom and true heavy metal, created a piece of history, a must for every metal kid. And the story begins right here\u2026four guys that wanted to play fast and brutal join together and after few demos, they recorded the first album, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d. Ten tracks of pure speed/thrash metal. The first thing you can hear is the speed and the way of playing drums by Dave Lombardo: the brutal up tempos are still very influenced by punk music. Araya\u2019s vocals are far more brutal than Hetfield ones and anyone thrash metal singer at the time. In the choirs of the first track \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d we have also Gene Hoglan singing! This song is incredible with a bunch of guitars solos, that are still melodic but incredibly fast for that period.\n\n\u201cAntichrist\u201d song is a good example for those who want to know the power of Araya\u2019s vocals at the time. The guitars are always very catchy and incredible obscure in the melodies. The solos are still very \u201cheavy metal\u201d but the violence is not common. \u201cDie By The Sword\u201d is still nowadays played live by the group. A classic with that bone crushing mid-paced riff in the central part, followed by fast solos by the guitars. \u201cFight \u2018till Death\u201d is pure headbanging!! Very simple riffage, always catchy refrains, fast tempo, punkish speed\u2026great, great, great!! The solo here is incredible with the shreds, tapping and so on. \n\n\u201cMetal Storm/Face The Slayer\u201d is truly apocalyptic in the music and is a bit different in its form. The Lombardo\u2019s rolls at the beginning are powerful and the whole drums sound incredibly 80\u2019s. Here the tempo is less fast, there is less urgency in wanting to destroy everything. The main part here is done by the guitars, that are very good at drawing melodic and evil riffs. \u201cBlack Magic\u201d deserves no presentation at all. If you don\u2019t know this song and the riff at the beginning you can leave and read a Cristina Aguielira\u2019s review instead. This is pure evil. \u201cTormentor\u201d is one of the heaviest metal influenced songs here and it\u2019s fantastic. \n\n\u201cFinal Command\u201d is very heavy metal in the riffs but incredibly fast at the drums, while \u201cCrionics\u201d is slower and obscure in its melodies, that are always well set in the group\u2019s skills. The drums intro the to last track, the title track, is another page of heavy metal. The whole song is fast, evil, bad ass and\u2026well, Slayer. That\u2019s all. This album is incredible forits importance, for the music and for the brutality shown in the year 1983. Innovators, killers, bad ass, violent\u2026SLAAAYEEER FOREVER!!!!!\n",
        "\nAMAZING.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a bit \u201ccommon\u201d in my ideas about this album, but I love it and only few others can match this one in intensity and violence. We must think that this was recorded in 1986 and even now a lot of black or death metal albums are not so evil and brutal.\n\nSince their first album \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d you could hear something \u201cmore\u201d in their music, compared to the early Metallica\u2019s one: the violence seemed to be from another world. Then on the \u201cHaunting The Chapel\u201d EP this violence grew with a better production and better musical skills by the group. After the gloomy \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, it was time to release their third masterpiece and so it has been. The goal has been achieved completely.\n\nI thing that nobody expected an album like this. Well, yes, one year before \u201cSeven Churches\u201d was released and still nowadays is regarded as an inspiration for black/death metal, but the pure THRASH INTENSITY is unmatchable here. Slayer have always had the natural ability to compose extreme thrash metal songs with a good songwriting and refrains that can be \u201ccatchy\u201d, and, as time passed by, legendary. \n\nAlready from the beginning, history has been made with \u201cAngel Of Death\u201d, the song-manifest of Slayer. The band is incredibly fast and Lombardo has become so vicious at the bass drum. This song is huge, a true piece of musical aggression. From the fast parts to the mid-paced riffs, the band is awesome and the solos here are a trademark. Araya\u2019s vocals are so screamed and schizophrenic, reaching the top in \u201cJesus Saves\u201d song. Pure violence with that mid-paced riff at the beginning, so easily transformed in an up tempo one, supported by incredibly brutal solos.\n\nHere you cannot find so technical parts or melodies so well done by Metallica and so on\u2026this is pure ignorance thrash attack. The hardcore influences are heavily present in the sound, like in the terrific sequence \u201cPiece by Piece-Necrophobic-Altar Of Sacrifice\u201d. Here the violence is terrific\u2026a train! Neverending up tempo parts, good refrains, fast solos, evil atmosphere\u2026a journey through the most far-from-the-sun zone of hell. The drums intros to \u201cCriminally Insane\u201d and \u201cEpidemic\u201d shows no mercy for the listener. \n\nThe two final tracks, \u201cPost Mortem\u201d and \u201cRaining Blood\u201d, are the most obscure, always being so fucking fast. The scary solos, the distorted guitars and the faster and faster drums lead in a horror gallery that ends with a imaginary (but not so much\u2026) blood rain. More or less 30 minutes of neverending violent emotions. A must for every extreme thrash metal fan. Here history has been made.\n",
        "\nIn its best moments, Christ Illusion is almost as good as classic Slayer albums such as Hell Awaits, Reign in Blood or Seasons in the Abyss. In its worst moments, it\u2019s not much better than God Hates Us All.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the positive. The cover art looks great, even if it\u2019s basically Reign in Blood, Mk. II. On a side note, I really can\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t put their classic pentagram or eagle logo on it. I mean, if you want to sell this as a return to the roots, why not do it properly and with conviction? The production is very competent. Even though production duties weren\u2019t handled by Rick Rubin this time \u2013 he\u2019s listed as executive producer, but it was actually Josh Abraham who pushed the buttons \u2013, Christ Illusion has a crisp, \u201cdry\u201d sound that\u2019s quite similar to earlier Slayer albums. The music overall is a lot faster and less groove-oriented than on God Hates Us All or Diabolus in Musica, which is a huge plus. Together with Tom Araya\u2019s much improved vocals, which finally don\u2019t sound as if he were constantly screaming through a megaphone any more, that eliminates most of the nu metal tinges that tainted those records. However, there\u2019s no denying Araya\u2019s vocals, while decent, aren\u2019t quite as good as they used to be back in the eighties and early nineties. Slayer aren\u2019t exactly spring chickens any more, and age has inevitably reduced Araya\u2019s vocal range. But at least he\u2019s trying and comes up with a commendable effort.\n\nAnother positive aspect is that Slayer have gone back to incorporating plenty of guitar solos into their songs, something that was definitely missing on the previous two albums. Some of the solos are even quite melodic, as opposed to the typical discordant whammy-bar solos Slayer are usually known for. Finally, Dave Lombardo is back. Not that Paul Bostaph was/is a bad drummer \u2013 technically, he\u2019s among the very best in the business \u2013, it\u2019s just that Lombardo\u2019s drumming, while every bit as good technically, is a bit more tasteful and song-oriented, whereas Bostaph sometimes tried to do too much. And besides, it\u2019s always nice to see a band back in its original line-up.\n\nThe first two songs, \u201cFlesh Storm\u201d and \u201cCatalyst\u201d, are both fast thrashers with the occasional brutal mosh part and nice solo thrown in. Especially the former takes us back to the band\u2019s glory days and is fairly similar to \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d from Seasons in the Abyss. When I said that the best moments on Christ Illusion reminded me of classic Slayer, it was primarily that particular album I had in mind. \u201cSkeleton Christ\u201d and \u201cConsfearacy\u201d (what an asinine title) are other predominantly fast tracks that would have fit perfectly on this classic from the year 1990. Tracks four and five are a bit more modern sounding, but not at all in a bad way. \u201cEyes of the Insane\u201d is a slower yet very aggressive song with great double-bass drumming by Dave Lombardo, while \u201cJihad\u201d features an intro that sounds quite unusual for Slayer, very interesting and imaginative drum patterns during the fast passages, and a spoken-word part towards the end that works surprisingly well.\n\nUnfortunately, there are not only good things to say about Slayer\u2019s latest effort. There are mainly two things holding this album back: inconsistency and sub-par lyrics. While the first six songs on Christ Illusion are all very good, I find the final four to be somewhat lacking in quality. They aren\u2019t bad, but in comparison to the others, they just come up a little bit short. \u201cCatatonic\u201d is obviously an attempt to write a sinister slow song similar to \u201cSpill the Blood\u201d from South of Heaven, but it lacks the haunting guitar leads and devastating, catchy riffs that one had. Moreover, it\u2019s quite repetitive. \u201cBlack Serenade\u201d and \u201cCult\u201d are also mixed bags that end up being rather mediocre, as does the final track, \u201cSupremist\u201d. The latter at least features some very nicely done blast beats \u2013 to my knowledge, this is the first time Slayer have ever employed blasts. And they pull it off really well, too, making it all the more incomprehensible why they don\u2019t use them more often during that particular track.\n\nAs for the lyrics, there are moments on this album when they\u2019re bad. Really bad. One of the things that bug me is the inflationary use of a certain four-letter word. For evidence, take a look at these lines from \u201cCatalyst\u201d: \u201cWin by attrition I bring it with all that I fucking am / You never dealt with such rejection / Licking your wounds that won\u2019t fucking heal / You\u2019ve never seen so much aggression / I am the scream to your fucking silence.\u201d\n\nI could give plenty more examples, my point being that there\u2019s no need to frequently use expletives unless you run out of really meaningful things to say, which was obviously the case on Christ Illusion. For the most part, the lyrics are rather boring and unimaginative, the usual Satan worshipping and Christ bashing we\u2019ve heard a zillion times before. There are two notable exceptions, however, as \u201cEyes of the Insane\u201d and \u201cJihad\u201d enter lyrically uncharted territory. The former is written from the perspective of a soldier who is haunted and ultimately driven insane by memories of the horrible atrocities he witnessed during his service, while the latter is a sort of first-person testimony by a suicide terrorist, with plenty of obvious references to 9/11. Definitely very creepy and also quite controversial, but then, isn\u2019t that exactly what you\u2019d expect from Slayer (cf. \u201cAngel of Death\u201d)?\n\nAll things considered, Christ Illusion is a pretty good album with some obvious flaws, which prevent it from being a complete return to form for this legendary thrash outfit. However, while not quite as good as the masterpieces from their classic period, Christ Illusion definitely marks a big step in the right direction. After two disappointing studio albums in a row, which lead to the widespread notion that Slayer just don\u2019t have \u201cit\u201d any more, that should be enough to at least earn them some well-deserved respect.\n\nChoicest cuts: Flesh Storm, Catalyst, Jihad, Consfearacy\n",
        "\nThis album saw the light two years after the incredible thrash metal masterpiece, Reign In Blood and it is quite different. Somebody, in my opinion, said to Slayer\u2019s members: \u201cOk guys, with Reign In Blood you\u2019ve reached the top in speed and violence\u2026do you wanna start a third world war??\u201d. I was joking\u2026well, it\u2019s useless to say how important was (and still is) that album but they preferred to change a bit. It\u2019s always fucking heavy thrash, but there are more slow songs here, starting from the great title track.\n\nThis album can be considered as a mix of the masterpiece before with the obscure Hell Awaits. As I said before, the title track is slow and evocative and something new for every fan that used to listen to the \"old\" Slayer. This song, anyway is great and a piece of the group's history.\n\nThe whole album alternates fast songs to slower ones. In fact, immediately after the first song, it\u2019s time for Silent Screams to raise hell. Lombardo is incredible at the drums, while the guitars are fast as usual, alternating fast solos too. The following Live Undead is a masterpiece: it begins slowly \u2018till growing in intensity with a great solo made by King. Tom Araya\u2019s vocals are less screamed because the songs sometimes required a different tone, according to the new rhythmic session.\nThe following Behind The Crooked Cross is another example of this new way of doing thrash: the songs are more complex and technical, like also the obscure hit Mandatory Suicide.\n\nThe brutal thrash assault of Reign In Blood still lives in few songs or in some parts of them; as I said before in Silent Scream, Ghost Of War and Cleanse The Soul, this one characterized by one of most beautiful solos ever done by Kerry King. In this album, Slayer's personality grows in a different way and they learnt to mix a lot of influences from their early albums to create a solid ball of thrash.\n\nIf you look at the lyrics there is something new too. In the past they used to write about religion an the lyrics were mostly antichristian. Those lyrics were written by the two axe men. In this album, instead, was Tom Araya to write lyrics about war and its violence. \n\nDissident Aggressor is a Judas Priest cover, always mentioned by Slayer as their most important influence in metal music. They played it incredibly, filling it with their music personality but without changing its feeling. Simply great. The last song Spill The Blood begins where the title track ended: slow and obscure, closing a new masterpiece done by the true Gods of thrash metal.\nWith the following great Season In The Abyss, Slayer continued in this way, musically and lyrically. The finest hour for them.\n",
        "\nMetallica\u2019s Kill 'em All and Slayer\u2019s Show No Mercy paved the way for hundreds of thrash and speed acts to come. But this is way more melodic than most thrash out there. The music on Show No Mercy is basically Venom morphed with Judas Priest. In other words, NWOBHM, but faster. Very fun breed of thrash to listen to. The lyrics are pretty cheesy and not nearly as violent as Slayer\u2019s later albums, but the songwriting here is really good. And get a load of that cover. Classic.\n\nTom Araya was very young, and his voice certainly shows it. He screams like a banshee on many of the songs, and he even does clean vocals. Araya is truly at his peak vocally. Hanneman and King play nicely, if a little bit less skilled than they would become over the next few years. They play dozens of whammy bar abusing solos, and also play a few melodic \u2018Priest-influenced dual leads. Dave Lombardo does a pretty good job on drums, but he doesn\u2019t quite reach those ludicrous speed tempos he plays on Reign in Blood.\n\nThe production is raw and cheap, but still light-years away from Venom. The guitar tone is nice and thick, but damn, the drums almost sound like electric ones. In all of Slayer\u2019s later albums, you could tell instantly which guitarist was playing a solo, but it is harder here because both guitar tracks are dead center. Bass is average for thrash at this time.\n\n\u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d One of the best songs here. Like on \u201cAngel of Death\u201d, Araya lets out a scream at the beginning. A nice speedy number.\n\n\u201cThe Antichrist\u201d I just about crapped my pants when I first heard this song. It was a live version and I hadn\u2019t previously heard Slayer\u2019s early output. This one has a really catchy main riff and Hanneman\u2019s solo is godly.\n\n\u201cDie by the Sword\u201d This deserves all of the praise it gets. A true Slayer classic. The chorus commands you to headbang. Hanneman and King really burn the fretboards with the leads here. Hanneman\u2019s solo still sends a chill up my spine. Whenever they played this one live, Araya would always say this really cheesy intro: \u201cSome say the pen is mightier than the sword, but I say FUCK THE PEN! Because you can DIE BY THE SWORD!\u201d\n\n\u201cFight Till Death\u201d One of the fastest songs on Show No Mercy. It\u2019s really one of their first pure thrash numbers.\n\n\u201cMetal Storm/Face the Slayer\u201d Starts off with an awesome guitar intro. But notice the very first riff. Metallica seem to have copied that riff in the beginning of \u201cCreeping Death\u201d one year later. Interesting\u2026\n\n\u201cBlack Magic\u201d Definitely Slayer\u2019s heaviest song at this point. Has a great building intro then it suddenly starts to thrash. Very memorable riff. Great song.\n\n\u201cTormentor\u201d The best NWOBHM song here for sure. Vastly underrated. I\u2019m not sure why. You can sing along to the chorus! That doesn\u2019t happen very often with Slayer songs.\n\n\u201cThe Final Command\u201d Yes, it may be the fastest song on Show No Mercy, but is definitely the worst of the bunch. The song sounds very forced and unfinished when compared to the rest of the album.\n\n\u201cCrionics\u201d Another underrated melodic gem. Like \u201cTormentor\u201d, it is packed with clean vocals. The second half of the song is instrumental. It just keeps building until the end where a couple monster guitar solos are unleashed.\n\n\u201cShow No Mercy\u201d Starts off with a frenzied drum solo and turns into an almost anthemic thrasher, similar to \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d, but much faster. Wonderful choice of a closer.\n\nDespite a few similar sounding songs and raw production, this is definitely a must for Slayer fans with an open mind.\n",
        "\nThis album is underrated. There will never be sufficient praise bestowed upon Slayer\u2019s work in order to qualify into a justifiable amount. Reign in Blood is a remarkable achievement, and it will always stand as a mighty monument before which all other bands, except Judas Priest, must simply kneel down and admire. This is, so far without a doubt, the greatest thrash album of all time, and one of the greatest accomplishments in all of metal.\n\nBefore I get to describing how much this album rules I must confess that I despise the naysayers. Those unsatisfied blokes whom claim that this album is \u201cnot that great\u201d or \u201coverrated\u201d. Well fuck you. All I can say is that you assholes have got it all wrong. This album is more than just \u201cfast speed\u201d or \u201cbrutality\u201d or even \u201cshock value\u201d. The music featured here captivates something beyond the tangible and the comprehensible. Listening to this with the mindset of wanting to hear \u201ccool riffs\u201d or \u201cbrutal songs\u201d or even something resembling memorability will yield undesirable results. On Reign in Blood, Slayer have captivated the very essence of what makes life worth living: conflict. The struggle that brings that glorious sensation of victory is found here in its purest form on Reign in Blood.\n\nNow prepare to have your epidermis sanded off; your bones cracked and shattered; your bowels viciously removed and every part of your body melted into liquid shit. This is the most supreme, ball-busting, gut-punching, bone crushing and amazingly awesome and intense thrash metal album ever created.\n\nFirst and foremost, the riffs. There is absolutely nothing to complain about. Some might cry and whine about how they are not memorable or catchy and what not, but that\u2019s not the point. Every riff is simply overflowing with powerful and violent urgency. Chromatic notes blend together to for a vast array of atonal harmonies. Aggressive melodies swirl around a sonic landscape filled with abysmal lava and surging water; locked forever in constant struggle. Every note of every riff is sequenced to create tremendous amounts of colorful contrast. The contrast may not initially leap out at first, but it slowly reveals itself after repeated listens. The contrast certainly does ,however, paint a vivid and beautiful picture of every type of conflict the mind can possibly think of. There is just no end to the vivid images conjured by such incredible guitar riffing. Not to mention the outrageous guitar solos.\n\nSpeaking of which, the solos are far more cleverly arranged than most people realize. Sure, they are indeed a mish mash of random notes selected from the Satan scale. Yet, somehow Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King manage to make sense out of such insane chaos. The solos themselves travel through the same rise and fall tension of an entire song. It\u2019s safe to say that Slayer is good at making coherency out of chaos.\n\nThis concept is also reflected in the ultra intense songwriting. Just listen to the naysayers now: \u201cIt feels incomplete\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s underdeveloped\u201d. Well, what the hell do they fucking want? Do they want a catchy chorus, or a memorable verse? Well there isn\u2019t any here! If you\u2019re looking for a sing-along complete with plastic hooks, try the pop band Pantera! As far as the songwriting goes, it\u2019s indeed among the best. Possibly Slayer\u2019s best. On Reign in Blood, Slayer exhibited a willingness to descend into absurd extremities most bands are afraid of venturing into. The songwriting is triumphant not because it\u2019s catchy or memorable or any of the sort. Indeed, the beauty of each song is derived from their ability to change tempo, texture, and feel in one abrupt and violent motion. Such instantaneous alterations occur frequently; often too fast for any unprepared listener to fully grasp. The melodies and differences between each composition are quite subtle, and often obscured by the unquenchable thirst for blood. But lo and behold they will be noticeable after many listens. The pace and direction will change without warning, and yet, Slayer manage to form a visible structure out of such madness. In the hands of any lesser bands, the structure would have simply crumbled into insignificant pieces. In the hands of Slayer, it transforms into and elegant skyscraper; towering above the landscape and dwarfing all other buildings.\n\nReign in Blood is a brilliant work of art when standing on its own. However, the influence it hath wrought is not to be ignored. It is indeed, quite simply, one of the most influential metal albums of all time. That fact alone elevates its importance. The convoluted style of songwriting feature here would be mimicked by copious amounts of death metal bands including, Morbid Angel, Deicide, At the Gates, Atheist, Crimson Massacre and countless others. Such mind maddening intense songwriting was not done by any other bands prior to or at the time this album was released. Not Kreator, Metallica, Megadeth and certainly not Dark Angel. It\u2019s safe to say that Slayer may have single handedly changed the face of metal.\n\nUltimately, what makes Reign in Blood such a bold triumph is its garish disregard for all life. The ridiculous Christian derived concept of \u201csanctity of life\u201d is whole heartedly rejected. It cares not for whatever pathetic life forms that stand in the way. Most importantly however, it does not try to impress anyone. Unlike Dark Angel, whom were busy trying to impress mindless head bangers and pseudo-intellectuals alike, it does not WANT to be liked. It does not WANT to be enjoyed. It has absolutely no intentions of satisfying a bunch of metal heads or snobby intellectuals. Reign in Blood almost seems to reflect the continuity of our chaotic universe. It is not good nor evil or anything. It just simply IS.\n\nReign in Blood is ,quite frankly, the most breathtakingly beautiful collection of metal songs ever known to humanity. It represents everything metal should be. It is an unsurpassable work of art which must be the envy of all other bands. The only possible exception is of course, Sad Wings of Destiny from the mighty Judas Priest. But let\u2019s save that for another review. Meanwhile, we shall leave in awe of such an eloquent musical masterwork. Hail Slayer! And the highest praise goes Reign in Blood, the most supreme and inspirational thrash album of all time!\n",
        "\nActually, this album is not one of my favorites. It took me quite sometimes to accept their punk inclination that seems nonsense at first. Eventually I begin to comprehend that there are many things that can be enjoyed by just listening to Undisputed Attitude. Maybe this is where I learn some new stuff about punk music and its unique features. \n\n\nSince I do not really remember the name of punk bands covered by Slayer, probably I just describe them as veteran ones. Well, I only have with me the regular CD version which comes with no bonus tracks; \u201cSick Boy\u201d and \u201cMemories of Tomorrow\u201d. Anyway, the opening track is absolutely refreshing and powerful due to the first verse: \u201cDisintegrate you bastard!!\u201d which then followed by a layer of chugging punk riffs as if I was standing in front of punk live show. This track alone makes me want to jump up and down and bang my head like hell which as a whole, an absolutely invigorating song. What makes me surprise even for more is that, I never had idea that punk hardcore music would be this good. I wonder how the actual bands would sound like.\n\n\nThere\u2019s more than meets the eye in this album. The addition of machine gun blast beats in certain songs immediately told me to listen to this album even further. Paul drumming is absolutely in its top form and every single beat could be clearly heard following his solid excellent performance in Divine Intervention. Araya\u2019s vocals are also at its best since I could feel that he sings every song with full spirit and dedication. Just like in the third track \u201cAbolish Government / Superficial Love\u201d and Hanneman\u2019s unnamed punk side projects \u201cCan\u2019t Stand You\u201d and \u201cDdamm\u201d. While \u201cAbolish Government\u201d is entirely listenable, the next rack \u201cCan\u2019t Stand You\u201d is an incredible punk masterpiece and a little bit hilarious too.\n\n\n\u201cViolent Pacification\u201d is something that I thought never got a chance to fuel my adrenalin, but this song\u2019s cool and stylistically insane with Araya\u2019s crispy bass volume perhaps unmatched to the original band itself. Jeff Hanneman and King are doing their job well in ensuring that their punk - inspired thrash sound never go out of style. Their riffs are convincingly suitable for this album which exhibits full fledged catchy tunes. Mostly are heavy and repetitive riffs with bass solo interludes which are apparently sticking out from the background. As for \u201cI\u2019m Gonna be your God\u201d and \u201cRichard Hung Himself\u201d these tracks are suitable for mature audiences only! The music is typically all right but the lyrics are one of the insane ones from this album. Not for children of course.\n\n\nFinally the album closes with the return of Slayer\u2019s original output; \u201cGemini\u201d is perhaps one of their slowest tracks ever in spite of Paul\u2019s intricate and precise drumming that are abundant throughout the entire song. As usual, the black flames of riffing insanity are thundering the whole song structures from the very beginning regardless of the sluggish advancement. Araya seems to enjoy singing the verses as well as the choruses with pure relaxation as though he was drinking a glass of champagne with ease.\n\n\nSo how was that? Did you find this review helpful in order to consolidate your maniacal interest in Slayer\u2019s furious intent? I hope you guys enjoy reading my review and don\u2019t hesitate to criticize me since I\u2019m just a green that needed someone to show me the rope.\n",
        "\nThis is probably one of the most well known songs of 'Slayer', maybe even one of the most well known thrash songs ever, justifiably. This intimidating hymn is the closing track of one of the most evil, intense, brutal and influential thrash albums ever made. So yeah, only by it's honorable capacity you can guess that this is one has a pretty lethal riffage which isn't recommended for fragile necks!\n\nThis monster rushes immediately with tremolo picked riffing, not longer 'Araya' whips intensively the lyrics in extremely fast tempo, and suddenly everything stops! Did they lost their power? Did their right hand had suddenly exploded and flied away to china due to their continuous riff annihilation in the former twenty four minutes of 'Reign In Blood'? Hell no.\n\nSuddenly comes a sound sample of rain (which raining blood, I guess) and after that comes a topnotched, quality, evil riff which builds a piece of terrifying atmosphere. Then the riffing played at breakneck speed again and not later comes another awesome catchy riff, evil as the former one. There are some tempo changes later and different variations of the former riffs and chaotic, destructive soloing which ends this song in a powerful way. \n\nOverall, well composed song, great structure and the riffage is just excellent. One of Slayer's best songs, and an excellent way to close one of the most bloody thrash albums ever made.\n",
        "\nThe second full-length album from American thrash metal band Slayer must have been something of a shock to the record buying public, even years before the infamous trial over its alleged influence on a couple of young fans, who decided to interpret the lyrics booklet as an instruction manual. Following the insane (and in most cases, merely immature) wickedness of the Norwegian black metal bands in the early 90s, who burned down churches and stabbed each other because the cold made them angry, and then screamed their lungs out about it against an impenetrably distorted musical background of white noise, this thirty-seven-minute heavy metal beast doesn\u2019t seem quite so bad. Nevertheless, this can be easily considered the first truly characteristic Slayer album, and my personal favourite for fairly odd reasons.\n\nThe distinctive Slayer sound first surfaced on the band\u2019s previous release, the four-track E.P. \u2018Haunting the Chapel,\u2019 rather than the 1983 debut \u2018Show No Mercy\u2019 which ran more along the lines of the darker side of the British heavy metal scene, seemingly particularly influenced by the Satanic band Venom with whom Slayer would tour following the release of this album. This Venom and Mot\u00f6rhead influence is still audible in \u2018Hell Awaits,\u2019 but to a far lesser extent, as this is the first Slayer album to set the band\u2019s distinctive and highly influential sound, despite the overwhelming plaudits of its successor \u2018Reign in Blood.\u2019 Introducing frequent changes of rhythm and time signature, and breaking chaotically into guitar or drum solos without warning, the material on this album is longer on average than the violent, adrenaline fuelled outbursts Slayer would become known for, but rivals all later releases in terms of its innovation and pure evilness. That said, the extreme song length of six-minutes-plus in several instances does hinder the album from achieving the kind of popular recognition that its later spawnings would receive.\n\nRecorded in August 1985 (just before I was born. That\u2019s of no relevance at all, but it\u2019s the sort of thing you can\u2019t help but notice), the production quality of this album is noticeably murkier and dirtier than that of their major label successors, but as this scarcely reduces the impact of Dave Lombardo\u2019s crushing drums, the exception being in the fourth track, and leaves Kerry King\u2019s fret assaults unscathed, the resulting hellish atmosphere created by this underproduced backdrop is far more fitting to the music and lyrics, making it easy to imagine that this was recorded in a crypt, or at least a basement housing stowed corpses, rather than the timid sounding Eldorado Studios in Hollywood. Tom Araya yells his way through the album\u2019s entirety, showing off his admirable lung ability \u2013 he was a respiratory therapist after all \u2013 but not being afraid to reveal his limitations in passages that are simply too fast to shout audibly over, reverting to a simple yell and, in the solitary case of \u2018Crypts of Eternity,\u2019 an extended heavy metal wail. The live feel of this album makes it all the more enjoyable to listen to, regardless of whether it was recorded piece by piece, and while the riff changes all sound effective and clearly took a great deal of planning, the guitar solos sound positively arbitrary and improvised in most cases.\n\nA long fade in of eerie torturous sound effects and backmasked backwards vocals subconsciously urging the listener to \u2018join us\u2019 gets things off to a disconcerting start, with the quiet squeal of a maniacally soloing guitar in the background. Over the course of these seven songs, much will be toyed with in terms of volume and tempo, and several songs start in the similar fashion of a quiet introduction followed by the crushing volume of the first verse. Presumably this is either to increase tension, or to fool new listeners into turning up their stereo speakers, which will then explode in their faces. The opening title track is led by a predominantly slow and heavy guitar riff, backed up always by Dave Lombardo\u2019s drums which sound almost tribal like those of the band\u2019s thrash contemporaries Sepultura in places, keeping a permanent rhythm despite all the experimentation. The song becomes faster and more indebted to its Venom-style roots before suddenly changing to a sound that can only be described as trademark Slayer: the instruments running at full pelt with minimal effort to introduce a pleasant harmony into the manic riffs, and Araya yelling frantically to keep up. The song\u2019s two main guitar solos, by which I mean any wild fret masturbation that lasts for more than two seconds, both come towards the end and demonstrate Slayer\u2019s influence as a pre-death-metal band. The only really weak part of this song is the horribly false sounding distortion of the \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019 line of the chorus, which is completely unnecessary and distracting as the band were making a fairly convincing portrayal of Hell in the first place without studio trickery.\n\nA brief pause separates the first song from \u2018Kill Again,\u2019 and to casual listeners \u2013 if such a thing can exist in this case \u2013 would probably be unable to tell the difference if the pause was less noticeable. The song begins at full pelt, introducing some nice dual lead guitars (in a down-tuned, evil way rather than catchy Iron Maiden style), and Lombardo\u2019s drums keep an interesting marching rhythm that helps set the scene for the inexcusably violent lyrics of death, gore and hate. Araya is forced to yell in tongues until the song takes a bit of a breather, and even lets out a long shout, similar to the one that would open the next album, as the last verse kicks in. King\u2019s guitar solo is slower paced this time, and while not particularly inventive, it\u2019s nice to hear him play some simple scales... or whatever that\u2019s called. I\u2019m no musician, I just listen to the stuff.\n\nEvil harmonics open the vampire song \u2018At Dawn They Sleep,\u2019 predating the sound that Testament would use repeatedly throughout the late eighties, while the rhythm changes and great segue into chorus foreshadow the more well-known \u2018Angel of Death\u2019 that was to come later. The vocals are at their best here, relentless and not content to be limited to the verses and choruses for the first time, insisting on continuing pretty much throughout and coming in early for once. The guitar solo half-way through is the best so far, sounding pre-planned and almost like Iron Maiden, but still making some obvious sacrifices of notes in order to keep the pace, before a great, slow, headbanging riff comes in that sounds similar to the end of Machine Head\u2019s \u2018Davidian.\u2019 Despite this perhaps being the best song so far, it seems to drag on towards the end, and is perhaps just fatigue on the part of the listener as the band continues to play at full pelt. Some kind of acoustic ballad would be entirely inappropriate on this disc, but it would have at least made for a nice breather.\n\nSuffering for the same reason as the middle song of the album, \u2018Praise of Death\u2019 is the least exciting piece here, sounding too similar to the previous two songs in its speed and delivery. The drums sound unusually like they\u2019re made of cardboard, the only time the mid-eighties production becomes an issue, and the randomness of the guitar solos actually becomes a problem here, rather than something quite cool. Araya\u2019s bass can be heard prominently, and will remain for the rest of the album in this foregrounded position, but as it\u2019s just playing the same thing as the guitars in this song it doesn\u2019t deserve any special credit. All this song really has to offer are some interesting riffs in the second half when the pace slows down, and perhaps to signify the exhaustion there\u2019s a sort of death-of-the-instruments feedback section where the band perhaps collapsed in the studio. Unfortunately, twenty seconds later they begin again with the tired riff, making this distraction necessary only if you\u2019re headbanging by yourself in your room, and your neck needed a bit of a rest.\n\nThe most controversial song on this album is one of the very best, the self-explanatory \u2018Necrophiliac\u2019 that would, much later, instigate a court case in the same manner as Judas Priest\u2019s \u2018Better By You,. Better Than Me\u2019 and Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u2018Suicide Solution.\u2019 To be fair on those other bands, the offending Slayer song is a little more graphic. The guitar riffs in this song are memorable, never seeming like the mere background to speed that they did in some previous songs, and as the shortest song on the album (one of only two that are under four minutes), it avoids running out of steam like the previous effort. The vocals really go over the top here, effectively stealing the song for once, and there\u2019s a fantastic dual guitar melody that very clearly evolves into the signature riff of the next album\u2019s title track. Ending abruptly for once, the band missed the opportunity to incite further controversy by exploring the subject matter in even greater detail. It\u2019s a great song regardless, and it must have been pretty cool to be a member of that jury, getting this piped through the high quality acoustics of a court of law.\n\nThere\u2019s something about the title \u2018Crypts of Eternity\u2019 that makes this sound like more of a British heavy metal song of the period than something belonging on this album, something I can\u2019t really explain, and bizarrely it proves true with the subtly different approach taken with this track, perhaps a cast-off from their earlier years or perhaps not. Launching straight into guitar solos like Metallica\u2019s \u2018No Remorse,\u2019 even featuring the same \u2018distance\u2019 effect for the main riffs interspersed with drums, the song launches into a riff that doesn\u2019t seem anywhere near as vicious as those of the previous offerings, and is more content to be fun in the way Mot\u00f6rhead are fun, focusing more on creating a rhythm than a wall of sound. The only real problem is that some of the riffs carry on for too long without much diversity, only noticeable in comparison to the restlessness of the rest of the album, but as someone more inclined to the style being emulated than the aggression of the band\u2019s other work, this is perhaps my favourite song, if only for Araya\u2019s unprecedented heavy metal scream at the end.\n\nThe final song returns to form, and is a little disappointing in its position in the same way \u2018Praise of Death\u2019 let the middle of the record down. The primary song is nothing too exciting or unpredictable, with speedy verses of shouted vocals and those guitar solos I keep referring to as \u2018evil sounding\u2019 for wont of a technical vocabulary, but it\u2019s the last minute or so that proves interesting in the larger scheme of things. Lombardo\u2019s slow, pounding drums return, beckoning something great and evil while the guitars cower in a corner, until finally a great, slow chugging riff harks back to the opening song, in what I\u2019d like to think is a deliberate attempt to create symmetry. It works regardless, and the song fades out just as the first song faded in, the last sound we hear being Kerry King truly thinking outside the box and playing a solo on the screeching metal bits of the guitar you\u2019re not really supposed to play.\n\nOn a first listen, there can be a lot more to \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019 than meets the ears. Subsequent listens reveal that these elusive progressive or avant garde quirks are really just the same repeated tricks of time signature change, with some random and aesthetically questionable squealing guitars cropping up every now and again. In many ways, this album, while being vital in the development of both thrash and death metal, is something of an inferior predecessor to 1987\u2019s \u2018Reign in Blood,\u2019 which really cracked the idea of a relentless aural assault and edited out all the unnecessary extra length, but this remains my personal favourite Slayer album partly for these imperfections. Later releases were seemingly produced under pressure to avoid emulating \u2018Reign in Blood\u2019 by playing slower and more methodically, but \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019 has none of these restrictions, and is really the band playing the angry, vicious, exhausting, disgusting music they love.\n\nAs I noted earlier, the slightly fuzzy and echoed production really adds to the atmosphere, and even in instances where it\u2019s obvious that a learning process is taking place \u2013 particularly Araya\u2019s approach to vocals \u2013 it\u2019s nice to hear the imperfections of a band that countless annoying thrash snobs proclaim to be the best in the world. \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019 is a significantly flawed album that could have been a lot better, but I\u2019m not sure I want it to be, and even Araya has commented in recent years that the band could re-record it, as Testament have done with their early releases, \u2018but why ruin it?\u2019 Perhaps the greatest praise that can be said of this album is its previously unbeaten aural depiction of Hell, something that would later be rivalled with Iced Earth\u2019s \u2018Burnt Offerings,\u2019 which is better.\n",
        "\nWhat Metalhead doesn\u2019t know Slayer? Slayer remain one of the most popular, recognized and influential (for better or worse) bands in the history of the Metal. A typical discussion of fans\u2019 favourite albums almost inevitably brings up this album. Many consider it as a classic album worthy enough to be placed alongside Reign In Blood. This was among the first albums of this band that I ever bought and throughout my teens always considered it to be among the best albums Slayer had to offer. Now, with the benefits of age and many more years experience of metal and other forms of music, I\u2019ve come to a different conclusion. \n\nAfter releasing the hyper-fast and aggressive Reign in Blood, Slayer countered by going slower (in a relative sense) with South of Heaven. As a follow up to the latter, Slayer sought to combine these two elements in this album. The results, as often is the case when one tries to reconcile two antithetical elements, is middling at best. \n\nThe album opens furiously with War Ensemble, a wonderful thrash fest of a song that is justifiably considered a classic song nowadays. This track just sears with intensity and compositionally speaking, is a very well written song and has always been one my favourite songs by this band. \n\nBlood Red is next, and to be honest, I never grasped what the hype about this song was. The intro riff is mildly interesting and the main riff is typical of Slayer\u2019s use of melody, but this song has never gelled with me. This song never really develops into anything interesting and its only redeeming quality is that it\u2019s the shortest song on the disc. Spirit in Black also suffers from this: a somewhat interesting intro riff is lost in an abyss of indifferent and unoriginal riffing. I\u2019ve always felt Born of Fire and Spirit in Black should\u2019ve been fused together and the result would\u2019ve been one awesome song, as opposed to two mediocre ones. \n\nExpendable Youth is one of the mid-tempo songs and to be honest, its one of the most boring songs this band has ever written. This song makes Gemini sound like a Cryptopsy song. On South of Heaven, when Slayer somewhat slowed things down, they at least had great riffs to compensate for the relative lack of speed. The riffs in this song are dull and uninteresting. There is nothing to make this song compelling. How and why people rave about it is beyond me. Skeletons of Society is another mid-tempo song that is completely forgettable. \n\nHallowed Point is a pretty good song, but I\u2019ve always had the impression that Slayer ran out of ideas for this one after the two minute mark and so Kerry King and Jeff Henneman decided to fill-out the time by trading solos. Temptation, despite making a cat headbang in one briefly popular internet video, is another mediocre song that isn\u2019t memorable outside its intro. \n\nDead Skin Mask and the title track are songs that I still enjoy today but this album has little to offer me nowadays. This album is too self-conscious and deliberate for its own good. By attempting to reach a compromise between the dominant, and in Slayer\u2019s case contradictory, aesthetics of South of Heaven and Reign in Blood, they compromised the quality of their music. Previous albums had their hiccups and small flaws, but all were still excellent albums that are justifiably heavily praised to this day. This album has some great ideas, but many of them are squandered by this band\u2019s insistence on providing some sort of a balance. Essentially, Slayer are intentionally watering themselves down and lowering their standards. Would you expect to find any sub-standard elements on any of this band\u2019s previous albums? Of course not. But this album is filled to gills with mediocre riffs and boring songs. Needless to say, this is a betrayal of what this band once stood for. This album is but the first step in Slayer\u2019s steady and ongoing decline and sadly, things have only gotten worse.\n",
        "\nIf there was ever a time for me to forgo any witty, intriguing opening, now would be the time. Because no matter what I say, the message will still be the same: \u201cReign in Blood\u201d will beat the living shit out of you, your family, your neighbors, and anyone you know. In exactly 29 minutes and 1 second, the clear-cut message of hatred will be sewn into your mind, and love it or hate it, you\u2019ll learn a lesson in true malice.\n\nOh yes, and this kicks \"Master of Puppets\" square in the balls.\n\nReleased upon the unsuspecting masses in 1986, \u201cReign in Blood\u201d embarked upon a path that was left desolate by other thrash metal acts such as Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Metallica and Megadeth choose to deepen their sound with more intricate playing and (seemingly) more meaningful lyrics, and Anthrax became even more of a comic-relief Thrash band, but not Slayer. They looked upon the scene and determined it was time to show the world just what a hideous, vile-spewing monster thrash could be.\n\n\"Enter to the realm of Satan...\"\n\nAll it takes is the first pulverizing riff off the infamous \u201cAngel of Death\u201d for those to comprehend that this is certainly the album of the apocalypse. It\u2019s the dual oppressive guitars, the thunderous drums, and Tom\u2019s savage voice that will knock you off your feet. And it never lets up after that. \u201cNecrophobic\u201d and \u201cAltar of Sacrifice\u201d are the bastard offspring of Kerry and Jeff\u2019s cruel intentions, with blazing speed and an intent to kill. Tom\u2019s psychotic voice brings \u201cCriminally Insane\u201d to life, fulfilling its purpose to implant the image of an asylum patient poised to kill. With ease, Dave unloads savage fills all over \u201cEpidemic\u201d and \u201cPiece By Piece\u201d. But combine these deranged musicians together, and you get harrowing masterpieces such as the wailing \u201cRaining Blood\u201d, a bi-polar diagnosed \u201cJesus Saves\u201d, and \u201cAngel of Death\u201d, whose ruthless riffs have caused ungodly amounts of physical violence.\n\nEach member brings something to the table that benefits this album. Tom\u2019s voice is purely sadistic, and while there isn\u2019t much variation in it, he doesn\u2019t need it. He sounds possessed throughout this whole album, as he spits out his lines faster than you can absorb them. On the Holocaust themed \u201cAngel of Death\u201d, he unleashes a furious scream that\u2019s very often mistaken for an actual guitar because it\u2019s so high. While he doesn\u2019t write most of the lyrics (King does), he delivers them as if they were his own. They\u2019re disgusting, gore-infested, anti-God, and aim to hand you one of the most spiteful Metal trips you\u2019ll ever take. Listening to Tom shout out \u201cRipping apart, Severing flesh, Gouging eyes, Tearing limb from limb!\u201d could cause your mother to faint. To perfectly match him, Kerry and Jeff create some of the cruelest riffs and solos the world has ever heard. The glorified omniscient intro riff to \u201cRaining Blood\u201d is a stone-cold testament to their riff writing power. And while their solos are painfully mindless by themselves, they give a true frenzied feel when put together with the music. They tend to trade off, such as on \u201cAngel of Death\u201d and \u201cCriminally Insane\u201d. But it\u2019s Dave Lombardo who is the greatest here, as always. One of the most breathtaking drummers in the whole genre of Metal, Dave never disappoints. The tempo and precision that which he is able to play, especially live, has gained him immense respect and God-status. His double-bass will obliterate your speakers, and his fills on tracks like \u201cPostmortem\u201d will leave your head spinning. \n\nThere are only three flaws that this album really has. For starters, as many know, this album is the definition of repetitive. Everything will sound the same all in one sitting, but then again, that\u2019s the point of the album. It was made to never let up on its attack, and while it certainly accomplishes this, it could make some heads hurt. Another problem is that it\u2019s a little too short. This album is over so fast that you won\u2019t know what to do next. And finally, while others may hail it, I do not find \"Postmortem\" to be all that interesting. While it\u2019s got a great fluctuation in tempo, it just feels sub-par compared to the rest on this album.\n\nIt\u2019s all here folks: the satanic and gore-filled lyrics, the insane drumming, demented vocals, and searing guitars. I can\u2019t stress to you enough how much of a Thrash classic \u201cReign in Blood\u201d is. If I was about to get into a serious fight with someone, I would make sure I brought this album along with me. But then again, this isn\u2019t for everyone. \u201cReign in Blood\u201d is simply a straight-shot of aggression and adrenaline, and all of those who want some of that will find more than their fill here.\n\nOverall \u2013 5/5 (100)\n\nRecommended Tracks\n\nAngel of Death\nJesus Saves\nCriminally Insane\nRaining Blood\n",
        "\nThis revision of my old review of Reign in Blood has been a long time coming. I did not and still do not particularly enjoy this album, but considering that I'm pushing an unpopular opinion on a much-beloved thrash metal album, I think it deserves more than the old, naive, frankly somewhat embarrassing review I wrote for it so many years ago, especially considering that I've more recently listened to the three other classic Slayer albums (Hell Awaits, South of Heaven, and Seasons in the Abyss) and the greatness of those three albums (especially Hell Awaits) brings the shortcomings of this one into sharper focus.\n\nRumor has it that part of the reason this album sounds like it does is because the members of Slayer had been listening to a lot of Metallica and Megadeth and were bored by the repetition of guitar riffs in those bands' work. Indeed, in some ways the songwriting on this album is like a mirror image of Master of Puppets--whereas Master of Puppets endlessly belabored its limited set of riffs, throwing in countless superfluous bridges and transitions that do little besides pad out the running length and test the listener's patience, Reign in Blood feels like musical ADHD, lurching seemingly at random from riff to riff and section to section with little effort made at shaping these collections of violent riffs into actual songs. The riffs are strong on an individual level, but there's no songwriting context to put them in. \n\nCompounding the problem is the relentless uniformity of the songwriting--the tempo seems to be essentially the same ~220 beats per minute through most of the album's running length, and without the variations in tempo you encounter in better thrash albums (including the other '80s Slayer albums), the hyperfast parts lose meaning and impact. Aside from the first and last songs (more on them later), the tracks run together with the transition between (for example) \"Altar of Sacrifice\" and \"Jesus Saves\" almost unnoticeable. Nothing stands out of the amorphous pile of riffs, and they just sail through one ear and out the other, even if they might individually be good riffs when pulled apart from their nearly identical kin.\n\nAnother issue is the production. The sound on Hell Awaits was just about perfect for the sort of music Slayer play--it was clear and sharp but also raw, with an amazing cavernous reverb to the rhythm section that enhanced the album's malevolent atmosphere. With this album, they enlisted the services of the eminently overrated Rick Rubin, who has brought the best technical recording techniques 1986 money could buy, but in the process stripped away the haunting ambience that made Hell Awaits so compelling. Dave Lombardo sounds like his drums are made of plastic, the bass has been sent to the concentration camp, and the guitars are oversaturated with distortion and almost like a precursor to the hideous \"noise blaster\" sound that would plague albums from the mid-'90s onwards.\n\nSpeaking of Dave Lombardo, he's a truly elite drumming talent but this album does not show it at all. Gone are the rumbling, threatening double bass runs, incredibly forceful snare flams, and tricky drum fills of his earlier performances, and he mostly sticks to a single \"polka\" beat for the fast sections and generic backbeats for the rare slower section, with fills almost absent. Kerry King likewise seems to be phoning it in with his leads, hitting notes seemingly at random without any regard for coherent phrasing while apparently unable to distinguish between his whammy bar and his penis. He jerks that thing so hard you'd expect it to smack him in the face. Meanwhile, Tom Araya is at the start of his slow slide towards the hilarious Angry Yelling Man persona he now exhibits, his vocal delivery reduced to a monotone caricature and sounding more like an ill-trained dog barking at cars than the demonic snarling of Hell Awaits or even the way he sounded on Seasons, where he at least tried to change things up a little.\n\nHowever, when this album gets its shit together, it completely destroys. Exhibit A is opener \"Angel of Death\", which is probably 80% of the reason why most people like this album to begin with. It is by far the longest and most developed song on the album (indeed, the only fully realized song on the album), and it is the riff monster to end all riff monsters, charging out of the gate on the back of Tom Araya's infamous \"rape scream\" (the only time where he really shines), monstrously heavy yet carefully structured. This song does everything right, from the way riffs are developed instead of played a couple of times and cast aside, Dave Lombardo using his whole kit instead of just the snare and bass, and then...the thrash break to end all thrash breaks. Holy Mosh Jesus. The song lurches into a churning rock-crusher riff that redirects the high-speed fury of the first half of the song into pure sledge, stomping inexorably forward as Tom Araya spits out the lyrics with the most vigor he has anywhere on the album, the tension building and building and building as the riff becomes more elaborate and the beat becomes more insistent before suddenly blasting to warp speed again for the solo section and grand finale. Pacing, development, tension and release--this song has all the elements the rest of the album lacks, and is so good Slayer recycled it wholesale for \"War Ensemble\" off of Seasons in the Abyss and even the retread was an absolute motherfucker of a song.\n\nThe second highlight is \"Raining Blood\", which is paradoxically even more of a fragment than the songs that came before it but simultaneously more interesting. It sounds like an unfinished start to a 7-8 minute epic, with a moody atmospheric intro gradually building into a pummeling mosh riff, the song thereafter deftly transitioning between fast and slow, ratcheting the excitement higher and higher until...it stops. It doesn't really end, but just abruptly cuts off for no apparent reason, leaving you dazzled by what you just heard but frustrating and wondered what could have been, if they actually bothered to write the whole song. It's almost like a summation of the whole album, really--a lot of good ideas and potential wasted by a lack of focus, furiously raging at nothing in particular, expending its formidable energy in vain before collapsing from exhaustion all too soon.\n\nFortunately, Slayer seemed to have learned from this album, first creating its antithesis in the slow-burning, brooding South of Heaven, and then a synthesis in Seasons of the Abyss, which, while marred by a slight shift towards commercialism, comes the closest of any of the albums with Rick Rubin to embodying all of Slayer's strengths. But that's another story for another time...\n\nKiller tracks: \"Angel of Death\", \"Raining Blood\"\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s safe to say everyone in the metal scene has at least heard of this album, and many of them have probably heard it at least one. There are those that call this \u201cthe best metal alum ever,\u201d or at least \u201cthe best thrash album ever.\u201d There are also those who believe it\u2019s very overrated and not even close to being the best of anything. To really see this album for what it is, you have to take into account that this was released in 1986. But does this constitute it being called the best metal album ever.\n\nNot so much. This album has indeed aged and it shows. I can only imagine how this sounded to people back in 1986, but that\u2019s not how people hear it today. However, while it has aged it manages to still be one of the most furious thrash albums ever, and I would say in all of metal. The album kicks off with none other than Angel of Death, and from then on in you should have a good idea of what you\u2019ll be in for for the next half hour. Over the top lyrics, bone crushing riffs, pounding drumming, and the solos Slayer is infamous for: random, but oh so intense, wankery. The stars aligned and all these elements produced quite a monster. Jeff and Kerry really did come up with some incredible riffs. In fact, there really isn\u2019t a BAD riff on the album, only ones that pale in comparison to some of the others found here. Each song between the first and last tracks is under 4 minutes long (and only one of those is over 3). With this Slayer just sends quick hit after hit at you with no room for air. The incredible Necrophobic is basically the epitome of this. It clocks in at under 2 minutes and is a quick kick to the stomach with an devastating, speedy riff backed up by equally fast drumming and led by even faster vocals. While this is the fastest song on the album this isn\u2019t to say the others are exactly slow. Altar of Sacrifice, Piece by Piece, Reborn, Epidemic, and of course Angel of Death and Raining Blood are all very crushing tracks, following pretty much the same formula, but each song is made its own with very different and identifiable riffs, all of which are great. Any slow parts on the album, found in Criminally Insane and Postmortem among others, don\u2019t last for long, but even those are devastating.\n\nThe performances by every band member here is great. This album is Tom Araya\u2019s most energetic vocal performance. He has his so-funny-they\u2019re-awesome screams, and sings some of the songs ridiculously fast. He does his job on bass but it\u2019s nothing spectacular and not always fully audible. Dave Lombardo tore up his kit for this recording, especially on the aforementioned Necrophobic. He always keeps things interesting and keeps you guessing, and always adds a constant, driving force to the songs. Jeff and Kerry are who shine on this album. They created all hell with their riffs and even more with their solos. Some may argue the solos are nothing but randomness, which they basically are most of the time, but they\u2019re more effective than anything I could think of for such a chaotic, intense album. The production is very good, everything sounds as it should. Tom\u2019s bass could be a bit more audible at times, but it doesn\u2019t take away from the album because the guitars take enough control on the string front.\n\nThis is an intense album and there\u2019s no denying it. Unfortunately, the word intense has been redefined since 1986 and some of the intensity here has worn off. But they keyword is \u201csome.\u201d The fact that an album so old still manages to be THIS furious says something in itself. Whether or not it\u2019s one of the best metal albums ever is up to you, but there\u2019s no denying Slayer accomplished exactly what they wanted to with this album, and that\u2019s kicking your ass and leaving you wondering what just happened when it\u2019s all over.\n",
        "\nThat was fucking 1985 when 'Hell Awaits' came out to our world, and it exposed thrash metal to darker places that it never been at before. \"Show No Mercy\" was a NWOBHM album, it just had a more aggressive approach and striaghtforward feeling, but in 1985 Slayer created something much more brutal and heavier which influenced on a lot of thrash albums which came later ('Darkness Descends' for instance) and shaped the whole genre a lot.\n\n'Hell Awaits' is a pretty clear progression from Slayer's debut. The songs became much more varied, the riffing and the structures within the songs was more complex, and instead of making the same debut album again, they created something which sounds pretty different and quite inventive for it's time.\n\nThe title track which is also the opener track, brings you into a dark atmosphere and settles you into the evil mind of this album. It slowly fades in with some low voices which repeates reversibly on the message: \"Join Us!\" and then it finally welcoming you back. Then the riffing comes in, on a pretty moderate tempo and start to progress until it takes some speed ahead and so it raising some brutality within the first verse which sounds pretty evil. Araya shoots the lyrics in a rapid rhythm with full heat and increases the grimness of the riffing pretty good. There is also a nice break before the chorus, then the guitar playes a single note on constant tempo together with Araya shouting rapidly the lyrics and it all creates together a temperate, dark feeling and fits perfectly with the chorus which came later. Awesome opener track, maybe one of the most intensive thrash songs ever.\n\nRest of the songs are topnotched too, they are pretty complex and conatins a lot of fast, alternate picked and heavy riffs which doesn't sounds dull, similar or repetitive even a bit. Each song also has is catchy section which give him a solid and different sense from the rest of the tracks. 'Kill Again' has a straightforward and catchy chorus which reminds a bit 'Reign In Blood', something that other tracks don't. 'At Dawn They Sleep' has the brutal \"Driven By The Instincts Of Centuries Of Horror\" part when there are a lot of background vocals which flowing with the lead vocals and becomes stronger and stronger until it explodes and leaves you amazed.\n\nIn the bottom line: It isn't a perfect album, the production sounds a bit fragile for such intensive music, but the songs themselves sounds like a pure evil and each one of them works excellent. A must have for anyone who wondered how hell may be...or interested in a complex, progressive and dark album.\n\nHell awaits...and you shall join!\n",
        "\nOpinions vary on the subject, but if you ask me, this is when Slayer started to suck. The ferocious attack of their early material has been softened up and even their powers of heavy metal songwriting have failed them. \n\nThe best song on the album is in fact the worst one, and that would be \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d. Predictable, chorus-driven, and centered around a distinctive riff, it\u2019s what gets played on the radio in Hell. If it\u2019s a pop song by the standards Slayer set on earlier albums, give it credit for being a really good one.\n\nTaking a close second is the title track. This is the only song on the album that actually has a tune, and then only during the chorus. Araya\u2019s attempts at proper singing on South of Heaven are missed. This is Slayer-pop too, but it\u2019s faster so people tend not to notice so much.\n\nThe other songs are terrible. Many of them are the most-liked, too \u2013 \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d seems particularly popular \u2013 though I will not pretend to fathom why, other than their being more angry and \u201cmore thrash\u201d (not exactly a demanding standard). Boring, monotonous, predictable\u2026 oh, I already used the word \u201cpredictable\u201d once in this review. Perhaps I should consult a thesaurus. I guess the aim for most of this album is to memorable but aggressive songs, but this only translates into simplistic, lengthy, monotonous, lazy, and otherwise quite aggravating choruses in nearly every song. Slayer decided that melody\u2019s for fags and complexity\u2019s for nerds, and so delivered an album of paint-by-numbers sub-Pantera metal retardation.\n\nPlus the production bites: the guitars have buzz but no edge and the vocals are much too loud, particularly given their strained, atonal delivery.\n\nAll in all: this album\u2019s so bad it\u2019s scarcely ten times better than Divine Intervention. As for the band\u2019s subsequent catalog: don\u2019t ask.\n",
        "\nIt seems like sooner or later everyone comes down on one of two sides regarding this album:\n\n1) it\u2019s one of the best metal albums recorded, an indisputable classic, and a must-own.\n2) it\u2019s not. For all the influence it hath wrought, the songwriting just isn\u2019t there, aside from the first and last tracks.\n\nAt least a certain grudging respect is mandatory for any metalhead aware of the art form\u2019s history. Aside from giving us quite a lot of thrash, it\u2019s one of the huge, looming influences on death metal, so far ahead of it\u2019s time that a good many of death metal\u2019s canonical albums \u2013 early Death, for instance \u2013 arguably sound thrashier. \n\nEven so, a negative viewpoint is supportable. Slayer started out with a lot of Judas Priest in their veins back on Show No Mercy but quickly set about eliminating it (partially with heavy doses of Discharge). Reign in Blood takes them as far away from Judas Priest \u2013 from classic heavy metal \u2013 as they would get, and as seems to happen to a lot of bands, they immediately beat a hasty retreat from the abyss right afterward, covering Priest\u2019s \u201cDissident Aggressor\u201d on their very next outing. \n\nFrom a classic metal standpoint there are only two real songs here, and they\u2019re the two that are going to stick out to any first time listener. \u201cAngel of Death\u201d is mostly straight-up aggression but with a slower break that everyone likes, and \u201cRaining Blood\u201d prophesizes the riffing style Slayer would move towards on South of Heaven \u2013 but in between them there are eight other, much shorter tracks, which might be the most important ones.\n\nDuring that bulky mass in the middle the riffing and transitions are too frantic for the songs to have an immediately apprehensible flow. The slower midsection of \u201cAngel of Death\u201d is sort of unveiled, but the slow parts of \u201cNecrophobic\u201d hit like airbags in car accidents. Araya\u2019s delivery is too breathless to be sung along to and the riffs pile up as fast as the listener can process them. Catchiness is neglected, but structure isn\u2019t; even after countless listens I find myself consistently impressed by the way the riffs play off of each other.\n\nThis is a better death metal album than a heavy metal album; typically we split the difference and call it thrash, though it\u2019s still a fair distance from the kind of metal Metallica or Exodus were playing. How much you enjoy it will depend on the standards you judge it by. In my case (which is typical), it took me a long time to fully get into this album, but nowadays it\u2019s one of the very few I can listen to non-stop without ever getting bored. If not perfect, at least as close to perfect as we\u2019re ever likely to get.\n",
        "\nWell, here it is: the be-all, end-all thrash album of our time. It may not be the most original metal album ever made, the most entertaining, or even Slayer's best; (That place is reserved for Hell Awaits, in my opinion.) but its influence is more than enough to compensate for what it is generally criticized for: the non-stop, one-way, mile-a-minute fury that is just about as relenting as a band like Marduk. Had it not been for this album, we wouldn't see the majority of death, thrash, black, and even metalcore bands today. It is an understatement to say that Slayer created a cornerstone without even realizing it.\n\nBut how did they acheive it? It's pretty simple, really; in the writing process of this album, Slayer distilled every part of their sound. Every element from every album by the band is seen here, but has been trimmed and condensed into a furious, malevolent burst of violence that was separated into ten different songs. One example of this is the song structures and tempo range; goddamn, we knew they were a thrash band, but \"Necrophobic\" and \"Epidemic\" upped the ante on the speed and technicality the band had attempted up until this time. Speaking of song structures, one will automatically notice that the majority of the songs here are drastically shorter than that of Hell Awaits. The ultimate classics \"Angel of Death\", \"Postmortem\", and \"Raining Blood\", the last two of which are interconnected, span over the 4-minute range and constantly shift driving, full-speed-ahead guitar work. The former is probably one of the most dynamic and yet brutal songs Slayer has ever written; the mid-paced passages in the middle are ripe with hellish harmonies and headbanging power, while the beginning and ending are outright slaughterous in their delivery of palm-muted tremolo riffs and pummeling double bass. Everything in between is a maniacal, frenzied, wall-of-noise attack of spastic, chaotic rhythm guitars and solos, machine-gun drum work, and Tom's one-dimensional shouts. \n\nThings may blur together at first, but long-time listeners will find that even though the band are overtly violent in their delivery, things do let up a bit on the mid-album anthems of \"Jesus Saves\" and \"Criminally Insane\"; it's only temporary though. Tempos slow only for a matter of seconds before being thrown back into oblivion. I will make it known that when I say that the music is all over the place, doesn't mean things aren't done proficiently: Kerry and Jeff are absolutely flawless in their delivery of the non-stop barrage of rhythm riffs, and even though the solos may seem totally random, they're pulled off perfectly and only add intensity to the songs. The interesting thing is, this is constant through the whole album, but the never ride the line of sounding mechanical or sterile; a big plus, in my book. Dave's drum work is mostly based on thrash beats, with violent cymbal crashes and textural fills interjecting for the sake of dynamics and moving the song to its next phase.\n\nThough the band may not be very forgiving or varied in their delivery, one has to give it up for the endurance, power, and tightness in the performances here; not many bands can pull this off. Somehow, this album keeps you glued, regardless of the fact that many of the middle songs are cohesive to one another and sound somewhat homogenous. Maybe the album's length helps it out, being under 30 minutes. Either way, kudos go to the members for making one of the damn tighest metal records that these ears have ever beheld.\n\nTom's vocal delivery is of special note: sure, overall it's nothing too different from what he usually does; but the falsetto screams that open \"Angel of Death\" and are scattered through the other songs is one-of-a-kind. Each song is packed full of lyrics, and each song is also incredibly short and fast; so in turn, Tom is spewing out lyrics at an ungodly pace with ease on \"Piece by Piece\" and \"Necrophobic.\" To these ears, it's nothing short of wonderful; Tom shows no visible signs of wearing down, and each line is delivered with a menacing conviction.\n\nRick Ruben's production helps things out immensely. Slayer's sound got a modern update: the guitars are thick and beefy with a fair amount of treble, and the tone is one of the most widely emulated in metal today. It's one of those things you automatically recognize. Dave's drums are punchy and direct with very little echo or gating effects, but never sound compressed or hampered. The old-sounding tape hiss and echo of the former albums is absent, and this helps things out in the long run by confronting the listener with a full, no-bullshit sound.\n\nAt the end of this review, I contradict myself by saying that no set of words can truly do this album justice on a level of status and influence, even with a generally one-minded, unchanging nature. Buy it and love it.\n",
        "\nThis is good for what it is. Nothing more, nothing less. The songs are basically played the same way they were on the studio versions, but it shouldnt take away from the power that is used on this EP. There is obviously more energy and speed to these numbers than was true of their studio counterparts. \n\nBlack Magic was the perfect opener (though I'm not sure exactly in what order these songs were played). It was one of the faster and heavier songs Slayer had done up until this point, which would be a perfect buildup for the rest of the show. The version of Die by The Sword is even better than the studio version, adding a bit more speed and improvised solos in the middle slower part. Show no Mercy has the best performance on the cd, with a chant of SLAYER! near the end.\n\nTom Araya's song introductions are cheesier than a cheese sandwich, and adds a lot of comic relief to the fast heavy onslaught in between these banters. I mean, honestly....\"this is for all the little cunts who like to spread their legs in the night\"???? Truly laughable material. \n\nI read a Kerry King interview in 1986 that said that this album was released the same day as Hell Awaits. I'm still not sure if this rumor is correct, as the archives say November 1984, but if it was, I'm sure they would have included at least one or two songs from that album, so the myth is still up in the air. Nonetheless, this is a good EP. Its nothing definitive like Decade of Aggression, and adding Chemical Warfare (not the studio version that's included on some pressings) to the live set would have made it better than it is, but its a good addition to any Slayer catelogue for anyone who wanted to hear some Slayer official live recording before they hit the mainstream. \n\nAn interesting listen, despite being nothing worth getting excited over.\n",
        "\nI can't believe this is the same band that recorded \"Raining Blood,\" one of the greatest metal songs of all time. I'd heard this album was bad, but I bought it anyway, because after all - it's Slayer, how bad can it be? Well, really bad, actually. It's not St. Anger bad, but it's pretty damn close.\n\nWhat really kills me is that it actually starts fairly promisingly. The intro is completely worthless (I don't mind intros if they're done right, but this one definitely is not), but then comes \"Disciple,\" which actually serves up a healthy dose of ass-kickery. The opening riff is catchy, and the others in the song are pretty good as well, especially the one at about 1:29, immediately after the solo. Tom Araya's distorted vocals sound pretty shitty, but they're tolerable in the context of the rest of the song.\n\n\"Disciple\" annihilates everything in its path until the 2:50 mark. Then, without warning, it stops. You hear feedback. At this point, I think, Slayer decided to leave the studio. They hired a handful of bums off the street to play the instruments, and brought in the guy from Slipknot to do vocals (they figured no one would notice because Tom had done such a good job of sounding like him up to this point). During those few seconds of feedback, the band handed off their instruments and went on vacation, figuring that they'd let the bums and the guy with the mask finish the album and then come back to collect royalties.\n\nThat's the only way I can account for how much the rest of this album sucks. After the transition, \"Disciple\" goes on for about another 45 seconds, but at a much slower pace, driven by a single riff that sounds absolutely nothing like the rest of the song. After that, it just gets worse. Not a single song is memorable, none of the riffs are good, and all we're left with is shitty musicianship, shitty songwriting, shitty vocals, and shitty lyrics. Seriously, not only did they apparently bring in the Slipknot guy to do vocals, it seems they also let him write the lyrics. And if that's not the case, explain this: \"I need to vent - let me tell you why/I'm suicidal, maniacal, self-destructive /You leave me no hope, no life /Nothing worth living for.\"\n\nYou need to vent? Nobody cares. Kill yourself.\n\nSeriously.\n\nAnyway, there are actually 11 more songs after \"Disciple,\" but it feels like one long one. It's just sound. Chugga-chugga \"I hate my life\" chug-clunk. Weak solo. Chug. \"I hate you and I hate everything.\" On. And on. And on. And on. By the time you get to the fifth track, you just want to put them out of their misery. By the tenth, you want someone to put you out of YOUR misery. If you can make it all the way through the album, all you're left with is the realization that you could have spent the last 40 minutes beating your head against a wall and enjoyed it a lot more.\n\nBottom line: don't do this to yourself. It's not good, it's not even catchy. Slayer's subsequent album, while mediocre by their standards, is much better than this pile of refuse. Download \"Disciple\" and leave it at that, because there's absolutely nothing else on this album worth hearing. If you doubt me and think you might want to try the whole album, listen to that last 45 seconds of \"Disciple\" and try to imagine an entire album of that. If the very idea doesn't make you nauseous, you might actually enjoy this album - in which case there's probably something wrong with you.\n",
        "\nA lot of discussion has been about whether or not it's as good as their earlier stuff, and whether or not it's worthy of being considered a quality Slayer album. However, there hasn't been many people asking whether it's worth your money or not. This isn't as good as Reign in Blood or Show No Mercy or any of the first few, but why does that mean that the album isn't worth having?\n\nThis is a pretty good album, no, it's not as fast as they used to be, and yeah, there are a few duds, but there is still some seriously good music on here. Slayer do suffer a little from the first song syndrome here, as Flesh Storm is THAT good, but once you listen through a few times, you'll be able to pick up on a few qualities that the other songs have too.\n\nSlayer have managed to not be painfully repetitive here, there's a lot of different sounding riffs, and most of the songs seem to have completely different directions and ideas. For instance, the all out thrasher Flesh Storm is the only all out one, and Jihad has a very aggressive ending (before the whole spoken part) which makes one of the only really intense wall of sound moments on the album. Eyes of the insane is a pretty slow one, packing in a lot of groove, Skeleton Christ has a similar approach, but is still completely different. Supremist is all over the place in its constantly changing tempo, but still amazing. Yes, they're still play-fast-thrash-with-breakdowns-all-over-the-place Slayer, but the most of the album mages to do this in a lot of different, and more importantly, quality, ways. \n\nIt's not until we get into songs like Black Serenade that the album shows any real signs of bad output. The chorus on said song is pathetic, with a horrible, cheer-leading breakdown. Cult has its moments, but is generally average, much alike Eyes of the Insane and Skeleton Christ, but other than that there are very few outright negatives Christ Illusion, only things that aren't huge positives.\n\nThe band has gotten new life, and this is definitely their best album in a while, and an obvious catalyst for this would be the re-joining of one Dave Lombardo. Dave may not be the most technically gifted drummer on earth, but he still manages to stun me consistently. His ability to seemingly at random, launch into the most insane fills imaginable. Hell, he even screws around with the standard beats, even throwing a semi-blast beat into Supremist.\n\nThe guitar work is quite strong, with all the fast riffs oozing with venom as they rip away with more passion than we've heard in a while, the slow stuff is less impressive, often being frustratingly similar to the vocal lines. The main problem is the soloing, now, Slayer have never had exceptional solos, and they still aren't, but they are a little better than usual. Unfortunately, there's also way too many. Sometimes more than one per song. Christ Illusion does showcase a slightly more varied group of solos than usual, but there's like 20 on here, and they're not that varied. By the end of the album it just feels painful hearing the same messy solos over and over.\n\nThe guitar tone is definitely modern, but I didn't pick up on anything overtly off-putting about it, all the notes are clear enough, all very low, but it's not too bad. People who want to piss on the band are saying it's worse than what it actually is. The tone does cause the bass to be easily lost, but seriously, who listens to Slayer for bass?\n\nTom sounds pretty damn good on vocals. It's back to the old shout style, but it's lower than what he was earlier. It's basically what he sounds like live. Obviously more precise, just it's lower than the old stuff. The lyrics, which are written by the bands resident 12 year old Satanist Kerry King are abysmal, but who didn't see that coming? There\u2019s a lot of \"I've made my choice... 666\" sort of stuff around.\n\nChrist Illusion is a strong piece of modern thrash metal. If you're looking for complete old-school slaughter, you won't find anything on here after \"Flesh Storm\", except for maybe \"Supremist\", but you've got about half an hour of stuff that you probably won't like in the middle. It's worth getting at a slightly reduced price(I got it for AU$20, and I feel like I got my money's worth), but at full price there's probably too much average to justify it. It's solid, and probably as good as anyone could have seriously hoped.\n",
        "\nThis is the first Slayer album I ever heard and I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for it. Divine Intervention is the first of three studio albums which do not feature Dave Lombardo on drums. Paul Bostaph steps in instead and proves to be a worthy replacement. The intro to Killing Fields is proof of that. However, Lombardo is a legend for a reason and his presence here is sorely missed. \n\nThe best song on here is Killing Fields which gets the album off to a great start. The lyrics are easily the best on the album and the song does a great job of beating the listener over the head with riffs. Dittohead is close behind with it's neck-breaking intensity. Definitely their fastest song since the Reign In Blood days. \n\nThose are the two really memorable songs from the album. The rest are good songs for the most part but don't rank among the band's finest moments. Serenity In Murder is probably my favourite of these songs. It's actually a bit different from other Slayer songs up to this point with it's use of distortion effects on Tom's voice. This would become more evident on the next few albums and become ever more annoying but that's another story.\n\n213 and Divine Intervention are solid mid-paced songs particularly the former with it's macabre lyrics about Jeffrey Dahmer. As other reviewers have mentioned, the \"I need a friend....please be my companion\" bit is rather silly but it's not enough to totaly ruin the song. The only other song worth mentioning is Sex, Murder, Art. This is the most brutal song on the album after Dittohead and while it is a nice little number, it's too short! Just as you're getting into it, it ends abruptly. It could have been at least a minute longer! The remaining songs are nothing horrible but they're all pretty forgettable. Fictional Reality is a bit more memorable than some of the others but even that song is kinda generic. \n\nThis album was pretty underrated for some years after it\u2019s release until God Hates Us All came out and it started to look like Reign In Blood in comparison. Although it's not one of Slayer's best albums, it's still a fun listen and it's far better than the two albums that followed it. If you have Slayer's first five albums, I'd recommend getting this.\n",
        "\nFor the longest time I\u2019ve struggled to make sense out of this release, as it would seem to be either a reactionary piece of raw aggression to a changing world or a rather inconsistent attempt at turning back the clock. The album art would suggest a typical fit of pure evil similar to what was heard on \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, but when you look at the various new clippings and the picture of a dead man with blood pouring out of his head (some suggest it\u2019s a picture of Kurt Cobain) that populates the inner part of the foldout, the suggestion that some sand is being thrown in the gears becomes a distinct possibility, and does in fact occur in several areas on here.\n\nThe musical contents found on here are a somewhat bizarre mish-mash of speed/thrash, punk and modern groove influences. \u201cSS-3\u201d, \u201c213\u201d and \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d have the most groove influences injected into them, flirting with sounding like something off of Vulgar Display of Power from time to time. \u201cSex, Murder, Art\u201d and \u201cCircle of Beliefs\u201d are the most overtly punk inspired both in terms of structural simplicity and vocal delivery. The rest of the songs are straight up thrash with plenty of signature riffs, fast as hell drumming, and plenty of guitar solo interchanges, although it seems that Kerry King is taking a dominant role in the shredding department.\n\nAlthough I can\u2019t really complain about the songwriting, even in the case of the groove inspired songs, the production on here is quite sloppy even when compared to the oldest albums in the genre. The drums have no depth to them at all, the snare is tuned way to high, and the high-hat symbol is way too loud. Paul Bostaph\u2019s double bass kick work is hit or miss, he usually tends to suffer during the longer stretches of consistent blast beats (Killing Fields and Fictional Reality in particular), while during switch ups he tends to hit the mark accurately. Araya\u2019s vocal mix is utterly atrocious; to speak nothing for the new style he is exhibiting. He avoids the clich\u00e9 of worshipping James Hetfield that some other thrash acts had fallen into at this point, but the lower end shouts that he does end up utilizing are almost comparable to the crap that John Bush spewed out with Anthrax at around this time.\n\nIf I had to pick the best songs on this album, they would be the ones that tend more towards the Slayer that everyone loved in the 80s. \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d has a drawn out intro with some gloomy clean guitar sounds, before settling into some decent mid-tempo thrash, by far the most epic sounding thing on here. \u201cMind Control\u201d and \u201cDittohead\u201d are the best fast paced tracks out of the bunch, featuring wicked riffs, riveting solos, and the most consistent drum performances of the thrashers in the mix. \u201cSerenity in Murder\u201d is also loaded with quality riffing and listens well throughout, despite having a few groove moments and a somewhat flat vocal performance.\n\nSlayer fans will no doubt have mixed feelings about this album, as I myself can\u2019t condemn it as a failure or praise it as a masterpiece. It has its moments but it is consistently mired by an extremely poor drum mix and a lot of hints at the metal-core direction that they would later take in the vocals. Look for it at under $10 and be prepared to either skip around depending on your preferences in metal.\n",
        "\nWith their 1983 debut \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d Slayer burst onto the seen with basically what could be described as a cleaned up Venom or thrashier Judas Priest. While most of the thrash bands of the time claimed great influence to \u201cNWOBHM\u201d, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d sounds like it is a \u201cNWOBHM\u201d album.\n\nMaybe what makes \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d so special is because when you look back on Slayer you see an amateurish, both in production and musicianship, band that is nothing like the brutal powerhouse presented on \u201cReign in Blood\u201d. Although, this same observation can be said of Metallica\u2019s and Megadeth\u2019s respective debuts. But despite this, or in spite of it, they provide many early classic, and concert mainstays. \n\nAs said, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d has a very prominent \u201cNWOBHM\u201d presence, but the main element of this is Tom Araya\u2019s vocals. They sound closer to Rob Halford than what his vocals on anything on \u201cReign in Blood\u201d. But there are definite cues culled from the likes of Venom, Judas Priest and to some extent Mercyful Fate. Just listen to the scream right in the opening \u201cEvil Has no Boundaries\u201d and not think of one of King Diamond\u2019s or Rob Halford\u2019s wail.\n\nBut what is distinctly Slayer are the heavily satanic laced lyrics. Some are cheesy and almost Spinal Tap like in their silliness, while there are parts where it definitely works, and foreshadow the lyrical themes of future albums. \n\nThere aren\u2019t any filler songs on this album, but there sure a few standouts like \u201cEvil Has no Boundaries\u201d, \u201cThe Antichrist,\" \"Die by the Sword,\" and \"Black Magic\". But at just 35 minutes there is absolutely no reason that an album as good as this doesn\u2019t deserve to just be played from end to end.\n\nOverall, Slayer\u2019s debut, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d is an absolute essential for any budding Slayer fan, and shouldn\u2019t be passed over in favor of the more namedropped \u201cReign in Blood\u201d. But even aside from that, this stands alone and needs no rely on the following albums for support, and for that reason, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d is highly recommended.\n",
        "\nOh, please...this is weak by classic Slayer standards. Paul Bostaph is not even a pimple on Lombardo's butt in this album! More on that later, but the opening statement sums it up pretty well, I think. \n\nThis was a stab at Slayer reclaiming past glories, an attempt to show they still had it and it only half succeeds, like its predecessor, \"Seasons in the Abyss\". The guitar sound is still respectably evil and dark, and the drums actually sound pretty good, but the playing is not there much of the time. The songwriting is not up to par and is uneven to say the least; \"SS-3\", \"213\", anybody? \"Serenity in Murder\" is actually pretty creepy on the verses with Araya's droning vocals, but the choruses get boring and played out in short order. \n\n\"Dittohead\" is the only song on the album that really brings the dynamite in terms of them trying to show they were still valid, and the soloing even approaches their past manic intensity, or at least Kerry King's leads do; Hannemann totally phoned it in on this album. That one song on this album is the only one that comes close to getting my pulse pounding like, say, \"Raining Blood\". And then there is the joker with the sticks in his hands, he gets a paragraph all to his self.\n\nPaul Bostaph? Paul BOSTAPH? Who the hell was he? Oh yeah, that joker who was in Forbidden and thought he could hang in Slayer. And they showed a lamentable lack of judgment in thinking he could fill Lombardo's huge shoes. For crying out loud, the opening of \"Killing Fields\" shows it plain as the nose on my face; his double kick technique is sloppy as hell! He falters messily and it's only when the riff comes in that he finally gets it together. You hear that in \"Dittohead\" as well, the little bit before the slower middle part where he tries to rev it up and is all over the place trying to do it. Now if they'd gotten somebody like Pete Sandoval on this record, that would've elevated it to the next level, but as it stands the drumming on this album sucks out loud and proves he was emininently unworthy to be in Slayer. You need a certain level of precision and tightness to hang in a band like this, and it was just not there on Bostaph's part.\n\nIn the long run, this album stands as a dividing line between Classic Slayer (everything up until and including \"South of Heaven\") and Shit Slayer (everything else released after that album). Disregard this unless you are a completist and absolutely have to have everything Slayer had ever recorded. Otherwise, save your money and download \"Dittohead\" and enjoy that as their last gasp at greatness. It falls short, but at least on that one tune they tried, anyway.\n",
        "\nA live album from legends Slayer ought to be raw and evil and intimidating, right? This thing sounds like mud from start to finish, and while some would argue that this is the idea somehow, I'd prefer a somewhat more polished sound to reflect their status as a professional band. \"Somewhat\" being the key word, as metal shouldn't be *too* clean sonically; a balance needs to be struck and Slayer didn't do too good a job doing that on this album. I think that their quality standards needed to be shored up, and this goes for the material itself as well as the performances.\n\nI only gave this a 60 because this, in my opinion, shows just how Slayer were starting to go downhill at this time. You can especially hear it in Dave Lombardo's drum performance; he claims that he was having back problems and that Rick Rubin told him to raise his drum throne, and when he did it affected his double kick technique, which I think is a bunch of nonsense. His playing on this album is weak and sloppy and disappointing. \n\nThe soloing is disappointing as well; Jeff Hannemann sound like he plays the same solo on most every song and Kerry doesn't fare much better. Araya, ugh, how the mighty have fallen is the first thing that comes to mind on this album. His patter between songs is unimaginative and minimal and sounds like he says the same thing every night in every city. And his vocals are even worse live than they'd become in the studio by this time. He doesn't even come close to pulling off the scream at the beginning of \"Angel of Death\" or adding anything other than weak whining to the songs at hand. \n\nThe material is for the most part pretty good, don't get me wrong. But the horrid sonics and the lifeless, unimaginative, phoned-in performances render them powerless; even the last gasp of aggression known as \"War Ensemble\" suffers terribly from these factors. But they just had to go and stick several of the slower, interchangeable tunes from \"Seasons in the Abyss\", like \"Expendable Youth\", on this, and I hated that song--then again I hated half of that album due to the fact that half the songs were boring and interchangeable. \n\nSo overall, this is far from what I'd call essential. Get everything up until and including \"South of Heaven\" and forget about everything else they've done since then.\n",
        "\nSlayer has always been best known for creating the classic Reign In Blood album. Said to be a thrash masterpiece, some even go as far as to proclaim it as the greatest thrash release ever. While Reign In Blood was certainly memorable and classic, I would have to be one to argue that what we have here is even better. Seasons In The Abyss is in opinion, Slayer's greatest release, unmatched by anything they created before or after. This album is very varied when it comes to speed, some tracks are fast and vicious, while others are slow and haunting. Essentially it combines the fast and sinister nature of Reign In Blood with the slower, more sophisticated dark atmosphere of South Of Heaven. \n\nThe music here is straight forward thrash metal. The vocals here are nothing really different out of Tom Araya, which is certainly fine with me. Although they sound more like his performance on South Of Heaven, rather then his vocals on Reign In Blood. Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman once again put on a great performance on guitars, with some of the most catchy and memorable riffs that they have ever produced, my personal favorite performances being on the tracks Dead Skin Mask, Spirit In Black, Skeletons Of Society, and the title track. The drums are quite aggressive, Dave Lombardo manages to come up with inventive fills that never fail to satisfy. \n\nAs stated earlier, this album is very varied when it comes to speed and aggression. We have our ruthlessly fast songs, such as War Ensemble, Hallowed Point, Spirit In Black, and Born Of Fire. Then some mid paced tracks thrown in, those being Skeletons Of Society, Blood Red, and Temptation. Then we have songs of slower tempos, such as Expendable Youth, Dead Skin Mask, and the title track. All of this variation makes sure that the listener never becomes bored of the album, as each track brings something new to the table. Definately a good move on there part. Lyrically, this is nothing new really, not that it matters, the lyrics mainly focus on war, death, and corruption. And Dead Skin Mask is of course about Ed Gein's murders.\n\nThis is truly a masterpiece they have created here, not much else to be said.\n",
        "\nRegardless of whether you like \"Reign in Blood\" or not, there's no denying its status. So when Slayer proposed the idea of playing the whole album live and releasing it on DVD, we got a little worried. But, like they always have, Slayer pulled through and released a hell of a live performance. Though the video quality is a bit more grainy and rough than War at the Warfield, this only helps to bring out the savage nature of the music.\n\nThe performance itself is a Slayer fanatic's wet dream come true. Not only do they play the whole album, but they play it damn well. Every chaotic solo is exactly in place, Tom's vocals seem re-energized, and Dave's drumming is merciless just as it was in '86. You would think that things would come to sound rusty with age, but Tom does indeed pull off that hellacious scream at the beginning of \"Angel of Death.\" Even the tracks that most dismissed as boring are fucking vicious here: \"Reborn\" is played at an absurd speed, and \"Epidemic\" still has that kick-ass drum fill at the start. \n\nI personally thought that this whole thing would come off as a mess, but the band are dead tight in their renditions of the classic songs. \"Necrophobic\" was definitely a shocker; I never thought that the band would pull off such an insanely fast song so flawlessly. Tom never misses a word, and his vocal deliverance on \"Criminally Insane\" and of course, the light-speed ending of \"Postmortem,\" are nothing but godly. On the band's previous DVD, Tom pulled it off, but without balls or aggression. And believe me, there's plenty of both here, for the whole band. Dave's performance is nothing short of pummelling, and further proves to me that you don't really need technicality to be a good drummer. That famous double bass break in \"Angel of Death\" will literally melt your face off, especially with the fact that the drums have a sharp, biting edge to them the whole way through. The crowd during this show are fucking crazy, as they are at all Slayer shows: plenty of moshing and big, sweaty guys covered in blood. Good stuff. And of course, my personal favorite from this album, \"Altar of Sacrifice,\" was true bliss. There is nothing that compares to hearing a classic song with new life in it.\n\nThe sound mix is a bit more rough than War at the Warfield, but helps things out in the long run. Kerry and Jeff still cut through with precision, and the intensity of their playing never lets up. For one of the first times, we can actually hear what Tom is playing. Of course, it's nothing spectacular, but it does add some more chunk to the overall sound. \n\nIt would be a sin to not mention the wall of blood that comes down on the band before raging into the classic \"Raining Blood.\" It comes off wonderfully, and is almost intimidating. But one thing happens that kind of kills it: it drenches Dave's drums and kind of flattens the sound. It's no biggie, as I was still staring at the rest of the band covered in head to toe with blood. The same thing happens at the end of the song, right before the finally flurry of solos. It looks even better here, as you can watch the band in action get soaked in the stuff. \n\nThough this is the main aspect of the DVD, there are also some other things that help out: There's a documentary that gives insight to the band's past and present, and offers intimate details of Dave's coming and going to the line-up. Also included is a set list of bonus material covering 6 songs. The band go through some material from their early 90's albums, which is executed with brutality to boot.\n\nThis is definitely a great purchase. If you're wanting a more well-rounded set list, get War at the Warfield. But if you love the classic album this is titled after, you can't go wrong.\n",
        "\nSlayer. The name is synonymous with controversy. Did anyone not expect Christ Illusion to be controversial? In concept or with fans? I think one is naive to believe that a Slayer album wouldn\u2019t cause an uproar with fans and critics. Christ Illusion, although, was better than I imagined it would be.\n\nSimply put, Christ Illusion is a slight mixture of newer, groove oriented Slayer and old thrash Slayer. Both kinds of music are found on Christ Illusion. Right from track one a listener can tell if the music is Slayer or not by the dueling guitars of Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. Both are not showing their best here, but neither are dragging ass. Their riffs are as tight as ever and the solos may sound one sided (they all basically sound the same) but they are Slayer solos so expect a little chaos in those. \n\nOne complaint about the guitars is that a handful of songs begin with melodic guitar lines that neither showcase melody or great emotion. It can work if a guitarist is particularly great with melodies and emotional guitar lines to start off multiple songs on an album with that kind of thought. But Slayer has never been great at melody or emotion \u2013 not unless they are fast and angry. Those parts of the album seem to drag out.\n\nThe presence of Dave Lombardo (drums) is much appreciated. Even though Paul Bostaph is a decent drummer \u2013 Dave\u2019s variety and skill is still better. And more appropriate for the style of music that Slayer plays. His return to the fold has been too long and Christ Illusion may not be the most varied of his playing \u2013 it does show he has grown as a drummer away from Slayer.\n\nTom Araya\u2019s vocals are still\u2026well\u2026Tom Araya\u2019s vocals. It\u2019s not singing. It\u2019s not guttural. It\u2019s not barking. They just sound mean. And nothing has changed in this part of the woods in long time (since he lost that killer scream due to aging). So his vocal parts remain the same.\n\nDepending on how you look at them, lyrics are something Slayer is either good at or horrible at. They don\u2019t stray away from the hating of pretty much everything \u2013 but there are some interesting ones present on Christ Illusion. First to be mentioned is the inclusion of a song about \u201cJihad\u201d \u2013 granted they don\u2019t seem to know very much about the Jihad \u2013 they do know how to write something controversial\u2026which they do \u2013 even though it really says nothing that Slayer hasn\u2019t said before. As with the song \u201cConsfearacy,\u201d it sounds political but upon further review it really isn\u2019t. Slayer doesn\u2019t stray much on Christ Illusion even though the controversy around it says otherwise.\n\nAnd for the record, \u201cSupremist\u201d isn\u2019t a word. The word is supremacist. I have no idea why the song is named \u201cSupremist.\u201d\n\nOverall, Christ Illusion is here to piss a lot of people off. It\u2019s not that different from earlier stuff with a reversion back towards thrash but without losing the groove. Whether you hate the groove element of it, the thrash element of it, the lyrics, or the cover (which I think is pretty kick ass), Slayer is here to piss people off \u2013 and I think they managed to do it. If you think that you don\u2019t like Slayer to their dismay\u2026think again. Slayer doesn\u2019t want you to like them. That\u2019s why they do what they do. It\u2019s what makes them popular.\n\nSongs to check out: Flesh Storm, Jihad, Cult.\n",
        "\nThis album is either not given enough credit or straight-up abhorred by most of my fellow reviewers, and came close to winning the unofficial dubious award of being \u20182006\u2019s Worst Metal Album\u2019 on this site\u2019s forums. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a lot of crap out there. What is also unfortunate is that this album\u2019s and band\u2019s detractors are only too eager to dismiss this as yet another mallcore abortion due to Slayer\u2019s last two albums, Diabolus in Musica and the horrid God Hates Us All.\n\nAs soon as you decide to give Christ Illusion its first spin in your CD player you\u2019ll notice a few things: the guitars are still down tuned a la GHUA, these are thrash riffs you\u2019re hearing, Dave Lombardo has made his return count (Dave was always more creative with his hands, Paul was more creative with his feet), Kerry King is still writing most of the band\u2019s output and overall Slayer have made good on their promise that this sounds like a blend between Seasons in the Abyss and God Hates Us All. Thankfully for the listener the important factors are more reminiscent of SITA and the unimportant ones more of GHUA. This is unless you\u2019ve considered Kerry\u2019s lyrics to be essential to Slayer\u2019s work for the past ten years. Don\u2019t worry too much if you do, this is a vast improvement upon GHUA on all fronts.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the bad. And when this album gets bad, it gets\u2026 well, not too bad. \u2018Eyes of the Insane\u2019 sounds like a modest attempt at thrash by Slipknot, although the lyrics are nowhere near as insipid or as pitiable than anything the likes of them have written (it\u2019s about\u2026 you guessed it, warfare, just like 1000 other Slayer songs. This time, the song\u2019s written by Jeff and Tom). The riffs are sludgy and the solos are pedestrian, but the worst comes at the chorus: \u201cTHE EEEYYYEES OF THE IN-SAAANE! ON A DEMENTED CAMPAIGN!\u201d And then there\u2019s this: \u201cGOT TO MAKE IT STOP, CAN\u2019T TAKE IT ANYMORE!\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. Still, better than the watery, whiney lyrics from the last effort.\n\n\u2018Catatonic\u2019 is slow and boring. No other way to put it. Uncreative, plodding and at times showing hints of the worst parts of GHUA. Following it is \u2018Black Serenade\u2019 which is faster, but still plods along and is largely uninteresting.\n\nBy now you\u2019ve probably figured that, judging by my optimism for this album despite my qualms for the slower songs, slow is bad and fast is good. That\u2019s pretty much my sentiment for Christ Illusion, but what about a song that\u2019s both fast and slow? \u2018Skeleton Christ\u2019s\u2019 verses have a Pantera-style groove riff much in the stop-start-stop-start vein which if you don\u2019t hate already, you will by the end of the track. The chorus is kinda cool, except that they throw in a silly little \u201cHAIL SATAN!\u201d at the end. Well, it\u2019s 2006, you can\u2019t expect perfection I guess.\n\nIf you\u2019ve only heard one song from this album, chances are it\u2019s \u2018Cult.\u2019 Cult has a steady minute-long build which quickly dissipates into a fast thrash riff. The lyrics ain\u2019t exactly Shakespeare, but it\u2019s not a bad song and is consistent with the rest of the album.\n\nThen there\u2019s the rest. \u2018Catalyst\u2019 and \u2018Consfearacy,\u2019 despite the dumb name, are both fast and fun thrashers clocking in at little over three minutes a piece. For a comparison, think \u2018Mind Control,\u2019 the last track from Divine Intervention, but with the guitars down tuned and more noticeable leads. The leads on both tracks are a lot more prominent than Slayer\u2019s earlier thrash songs, but it totally works.\n\nThe two most interesting tracks are \u2018Supremist\u2019 and \u2018Jihad.\u2019 Jihad sounds a little underdeveloped, but it\u2019s still thrash and the execution is good as usual. Supremist shows some of the band\u2019s creative muscles being flexed, and although there\u2019s a sludgy part in the middle and at the end, it\u2019s still fairly enjoyable. Without a doubt though, the best track is the opener, \u2018Flesh Storm.\u2019 The lyrics are usual Slayer fare, and as the opener it\u2019s obligated to being the fastest and catchiest.\n\nAs I said though, this is 2006. Anything Slayer do, as well as just about every other old band that debuted two decades ago, will never be as good as what they used to be. Even the best tracks here are either barely on par with the worst tracks on great albums like Hell Awaits and South of Heaven, and if it\u2019s possible to go back to listening to Slayer\u2019s early catalogue over and over instead of giving this disc one spin, it makes this a pretty mediocre album (despite its upside). However if you\u2019re looking for an improvement over Slayer\u2019s previous efforts, this exceeds on that level.\n\nLet\u2019s call it a 56; just below a C, but slightly better than a merely average LP. The better tracks are worth giving a listen, and if you actually liked GHUA then this will sound like Reign In Blood in comparison.\n",
        "\nThis limited edition box set provides a great overview of Slayer's career with American Recordings. There are generally 2 common types of box sets, one is a really huge best-of compilation and the other is a giant collection of rarities and bonus tracks. Soundtrack to the Apocalypse is an excellently assembled combination of the 2.\n\n\nThe first disc is a collection of 5 songs from Reign in Blood, 5 from South of Heaven, 5 from Seasons in the Abyss, and 3 songs from Decade of Aggression (all Metal Blade material). There is an error on the track listing of Disc 1. The songs \u201cLive Undead\u201d and \u201cSilent Scream\u201d are mixed up. Disc 2 is a collection of material from the albums Divine Intervention, Undisputed Attitude, Diabolus in Musica, God Hates Us All, and 4 tracks only available on Japanese releases. It would be really hard to get a better compilation of all their albums than this. Just about all of the classics a fan could ask for are here.\n\n\nThe 3rd disc comprises of rare live material, appropriately titled \u201cShit You\u2019ve Never Heard\u201d. The audio quality is decent enough to understand what is being played. Some definite highlights include: \u201cIce Titan\u201d (an unreleased song that was drastically altered to become \u201cAlter of Sacrifice\u201d on Reign in Blood), an early live bootleg of \u201cNecrophiliac\u201d with a \u201ctasteful\u201d spoken intro by Tom Araya, rehearsals of \u201cThe Antichrist\u201d and \u201cFight Till Death\u201d, and Jeff Hanneman\u2019s home recordings of \u201cRaining Blood\u201d and \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d.\n\n\nDisc 4 is a DVD with live concert footage spanning Slayer's career from 1983 up to 2003.The audio and video quality isn\u2019t that good at the beginning but it gets progressively better. My favorite on here would definitely be \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d, showing an early Slayer in excellent form (this was so early in Slayer\u2019s career that they were still wearing eyeliner to look \u201cextra evil\u201d). I prefer this version of the song to the one on Show No Mercy.\n\n\nNow for the extra stuff included in the Deluxe Edition. Disc 5 is the first live concert that has been played since Dave Lombardo returned in 2003. This concert CD, instead of being housed in a jewel case, is in Slayer's infamous \"blood pack\" sleeve (also used for the Seasons in the Abyss single back in 1990). It's a clear plastic sleeve with fake blood and floating skulls inside. Audio quality is excellent and it is not overdubbed in any way, shape or form. The only possible downside to this recording is Tom Araya, his voice just can\u2019t take it anymore. \n\n\nAlso included is a large booklet about the history of Slayer and many of their controversies. To complete this collection are huge red wall banner with the Slayer eagle logo and an inverted cross in the background, and a replica concert laminate. \nAll of the discs and extra goodies are packaged in an \"ammo box\" which also looks pretty cool. \n\n\nThere are really only 2 problems with this set. One is that there isn\u2019t enough early material (on Metal Blade Records). The other is that the Deluxe Edition is a bit pricey, so newer fans may want the standard 4 Disc edition instead. When I bought this, the only Slayer album that I owned was Reign in Blood and I knew that I had to get this. Definitely worth the high price tag.\n",
        "\nWhen you mention the name slayer to a metalhead the word \"intelligent\" is not the first world to spring to mind. \"Intelligent\" springs to mind when you speak of bands like Iron Maiden or Dream Theater. The reason intellect doesn't spring to mind with Slayer is because for the most part their first albums are kind of silly and childish when it came to lyrics. Though musically their debut Show No Mercy was a wonderfully written thrashy NWOBHM-style album, the lyrics were still for the most part hooky and silly with childish references to Satan and Hell. Their second album Hell Awaits was a darker more serious release but lyrically it was still far from aw-inspiring (the song Necrophilia comes to mind). Even their most popular album Reign in Blood for the most part has silly lyrics. Not that I don't love these first albums but I'm just speaking the truth that the lyrics were mostly just written for shock value. However Slayer's fourth album South of Heaven is when Slayer became smart.\n\n\nThe lyrics on South of Heaven are FAR more intelligent and actually allow the listener to reflect upon their meaning. The best example of this on the album is the track Behind the Crooked Cross. The crooked cross in the title refers to the swastika symbol of Nazi Germany and the lyrics are about Nazi soldiers who realize that they might be fighting for the wrong cause. For some reason most people view all Nazi soldiers as \"evil\" but is not the case. The Nazi soldiers like any other soldier for any other nation were \"brainwashed\" to believe their cause was right and I commend Slayer for pointing that out. Sadly even though this song does not promote Nazism (it's actually against it) it still made people think Slayer were \"Nazis\" because they have written multiple songs on the subject. I am a historian and I have an interest in Nazism but that doesn't mean I am or agree with the views of the Nazi party. It's just an interesting subject to learn about and for Slayer tow right about. Right after Behind the Crooked Cross is another intelligent monster called Mandatory Suicide about how soldiers are forced to die in combat. Actually Tom Araya would dedicate this song to the American soldiers this summer while they were on tour. Another monster of a track is the title track (one of my all-time favorite songs) with good lyrics (not without Slayer's likeable nastiness) about all the hell that goes on Earth 'south of heaven'. This song shows Slayer's disagreement with Christianity but instead of saying childish lyrics like \"Jesus Sucks\" they do it in a well thought-out intelligent manner. Slayer would keep this intelligent lyrical manner of writing all the way through the Diabolus in Music album (yes even though they experimented with their sound on that album they still were able to write intelligent lyrics).\n\n\nActually the whole album is just a killer. What most people seem to bitch about is that Slayer is too \"slow\" on this release. Compared to Reign in Blood this album is \"slow\" but it's mot like they turned into Black Sabbath. There are many speed metal monsters here such as Silent Scream and Ghosts of War. Still these speedy numbers however and much better written than the material on Reign in Blood. Reign in Blood had some good songs but many of the songs felt only like portions of songs, songs that didn't get finished. Not here on South of Heaven as the song writing is tops and every song sounds complete and well thought out. Everything from the foreboding intro to the title track (which still gives me goose bumps) to Slayer's signature chaotic guitar solos. For songwriting this album is in top form and it competes with even better known and more popular albums like Megadeth's Rust in Peace and Metallica's Ride the Lighting. \n\n\nThe production on this album I also found to be perfect. Though it has a big name producer (Rick Rubin) it doesn't feel overproduced. It's also not under produced (ala Metallica's ...And Justice for All) but a perfect medium. Tom Araya even attempts singing on this release as opposed to shouting which is rather interesting.\n\n\nOn a closing note I should mention that I am not a Satanist, atheist, sadist, hate-monger or anything remotely like these things that are usually attributed by the public about fans of dark metal music like Slayer. I however love my music very dark and bleak. I also prefer my dark and bleak music to be intelligent lyrically and also competently written. This is why I not only view South of Heaven as Slayer's best album but also my favorite album of all time. So buy it, turn it up, and prepared to have your face rocked off but also at the same time having your brain wheels turning with the thought provoking lyrics. Yes, you read right, thought provoking lyrics on a Slayer album. SLAYYYEEERRR!!!!\n",
        "\nBefore I can review this album, I believe it is necessary to give you some background on how I came to listen to this album. The year was 2004 and I was just stopping to listen to mallcore. At the time a band which was receiving much kudos was Slayer. I had listened to a few songs and thought they were OK. I then decided I'd ask my friend if I could burrow a Slayer album, to see if I liked them or not. He gave me this...\n\n...and does it blow or what? In its entirety, the album has one and a half good songs. That's right one and a half. The good song is Disciple. This song is an awesome thrash song which features blood curdling screams, fast and aggressive riffing and fast and interesting drumming. Needless to say, it is easily the best song on the album. \n\nNew Faith is a song which is the song which is half good and half total shit. For the first minute and a half, the song seems like it's going to be good, but then the music stops and Araya starts screaming. When the music starts up again Araya's voice starts to strain and the vocals REALLY start to become annoying. The drumming becomes boring and slow and the riffs become shitty and boring, in vein with bands such as Slipknot.\n\nAs for the rest of the album, it just flat out sucks. Araya's vocals are straining (perhaps he was getting a little bit too old for this sort of thing...) the drumming is really boring and there is no flares of skill which might captivate the listener. The guitars also suck, as implied before, the riffs throughout the most part of the album sound as if a member from a mallcore band decided to compose the riffs and as we all know, mallcore sucks by default. So it's not surprising that the riffs bored the shit out of me. \n\nI think the lyrics are easily the lamest part of the album. I mean c,mon how sad and lame are lyrics like:\n\"Despair, emptiness \nIsolation rapes you everyday \nFace down taste the dust, digging deeper in your grave \nHaven't found a reason \nHaven't found a thing to fucking live for \nGodless he doesn't care \nHow you choose to destroy yourself \nIn a world that feeds on hate \nYou're left here just to waste away \nIn your cardboard prison, asphalt wasteland \"\n\nand\n\n\"Pessimist, Terrorist targeting the next mark \nGlobal chaos feeding on hysteria \nCut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game \nDrug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high \nSounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time \nI'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies\"\n\n...OK...That sort of puts me in the mind frame of when you get into an argument with a little kid and just to bombard you with insults, so in the end it really is just a slur and furry of cussing. Again this is similar to mallcore.\n\nAll in all this album sucks. The only redeeming factor on this album was Disciple and even then the lyrics were incredibly lame and stupid. So if you can get past that then you might be interested in downloading that song. While this album is not as bad as St Anger, it's not far off it. Don't waste your money or time with it.\n\nGood Points:\nHeavy songs with good production...\n\nBad Points:\n...but what's the point if the majority of the songs suck?\nLAME mallcore lyrics\nHorrible song writing for the most part\nStrained and sometimes even annoying vocals\n",
        "\nIt took me a long time to get this album. Not to go out and buy it, but to actually understand what it was that I was hearing. First impression: pretty much shit. This was not Slayer, it did not sound like Slayer, it did not own at all. What a naive approach to one of the best cover albums money can buy.\n\nSince the time that I bought this, I got into hardcore punk. Suicidal Tendencies, DRI, Dead Kennedys, etc. Pretty much the kinds of bands that Slayer covers on this. To date I've managed to track down and hear about half of the original versions and by God, Slayer somehow does it better, or at least just as well. The drumming is even more frantic than the originals (thank you, Paul Bostaph), the guitars are even heavier and more destructive, and in a few rare moments, Tom's vocals are even better than the original singers. His scream in \"Memories of Tomorrow\" is better than Mike Muir's on both the original and the re-recorded version, for instance. Plus you get to hear his bass guitar work, a Slayer rarity. Every song on here is fast, angry, and awesome. This is pretty much dependent on whether or not you like hardcore punk. If you don't, I hope it didn't take you this far into the review to realize that you'll hate this with every essence of your being. The only song you might not mind is \"Gemini,\" a Slayer original. It's way too slow, but Tom's clean vocals in the verse sections are a welcome innovation.\n\nSo to sum it up, if you like hardcore punk and/or Slayer, you may want to look this one up, hopefully not just for completion. This is one of the only cover albums that I've actually listened to more than twice, because even though Slayer covers the songs as accurately as possible (that is, with as little \"artistic interpretation\" as possible), it's still an original and engaging listen. Slayer's decision to give tribute to their hardcore roots rather than their metal ones was controversial for sure, but I think a better choice at the end of the day.\n",
        "\nAnd what a taste it is. A stepping stone from the sound they pioneered on Show No Mercy and the more vicious sound they\u2019d pioneer on Hell Awaits, Slayer\u2019s Haunting the Chapel is a small slice of extreme metal history that has weathered the passage of time exceptionally well. With its bassier and generally more imposing production and its choice selection of songs, the thrash connoisseur would do well to feature this in their collection: though it\u2019s only three (or four) songs in length, Haunting the Chapel is a top-shelf thrash album and one of the best EPs ever. \n\nOpener \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d is the heaviest song of 1984. Hands down. So heavy, that I\u2019d go as far to say that death metal pretty much started right here. Dave Lombardo\u2019s powerful, relentless drumming, the devious tremolo-picked guitars, and the maleficent (read: magnificent) guitar soloing were without parallel. Everything that was devastating and merciless about Show No Mercy has been pushed to its logical extreme and there\u2019s no turning back now, unsuspecting listeners. The vocals and lyrics are more aggressive than before and the riffs are as tight as a bombshell on the precipice of detonation. A representative of their mid-paced repertoire, \u201cCaptor of Sin\u201d wastes absolutely no time on anything other than kicking ass, lead guitar ablaze from moment one. The riffs and lyrics here are also very indicative of what would come but a year later in much greater volume. However, despite both of these being excellent tracks, it is the title track that stands as THE thrasher of 1984. \u201cHaunting the Chapel\u201d is a masterpiece in all regards. Riff-wise, it starts quicker but the verses epitomize mid-paced thrash riffing. And then it blasts into no-holds-barred destruction, with among the most evil harmonized guitars and solo trade-offs the band has ever done. Lombardo shows no mercy while Araya spits out the first of what would come to be a legion of anti-Christian-themed lyrical odysseys. Together these tracks three represent the peak of Slayer\u2019s material along with the two full-lengths that immediately follow them.\n\nAnd though it\u2019s not a part of the original EP, most versions you get nowadays will feature a fourth track, \u201cAggressive Perfector.\u201d This one is the last of the Show No Mercy style thrashers with its catchy chorus and NWOBHM-gone-to-hell style riffage and though not up to the same level as the EP proper, is still a worthy addition to the Slayer catalogue. \n\nIf you like the darker side of thrash (and you very well should), you\u2019ll enjoy this. And since it\u2019s far from being out of print, there are no excuses not to enjoy it either.\n",
        "\nIf \u201cReign In Blood\u201d was the signal that sonic apocalypse had finally come of age, \u201cSouth Of Heaven\u201d cemented the deal. On this album, Slayer refined their sound, finding their groove and proudly displaying a collection of songs that firmly established them as the dark lords of metal that they truly are. Emerging with an overall sound that is quite tempered in comparison to the all-out chaos of \u201cReign In Blood\u201d, Slayer initiates here the slower, but no less impacting death-crush that would spawn hundreds of imitators. On this record, vocalist/bassist Tom Araya is more focused in his singing than ever before. \n\nHis voice on tracks such as the dismal title track and the absolutely riveting and completely over the top thrasher \u201cLive Undead\u201d has a chilling effect which is anything but subtle. Meanwhile, as a bass guitarist, Araya concentrates on providing a solid backbone on songs like the instant neck-snapper \u201cBehind The Crooked Cross\u201d while the powerful tandem of Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King flesh out the group\u2019s vibe with doomy, evil licks, manic grooves and searing leads. Although drummer Dave Lombardo has been hailed on albums prior for his intricate, speedy work, he concentrates on dynamics more than anything on this album and this combination of talents results in the best performances of his career in terms of sheer creativity. \n\nPopular live cut \u201cMandatory Suicide\u201d chugs along in diabolical fashion as King unleashes one of his trademark forays into tremolo bar destruction. The real sleeper track on this record is the absolutely shredding \u201cGhosts Of War\u201d, which is a perfection of the faster-paced material of the group. With an excellently heavy version of the Judas Priest classic \u201cDissident Aggressor\u201d, Slayer tip a nod to a major influence upon their deadly twin guitar attack. It is on \u201cSpill The Blood\u201d that Slayer are at their most haunting, as this mid-tempoed, hypnotic track hits like an anvil dropped from fifty feet high. \n\nSlayer scores big points for being innovators with this record as it is here that they brought dynamics to extreme metal. What would at first appear as a curious career move is later realized as one of the most powerful heavy metal albums of all time.\n",
        "\nAh Slayer's earliest studio endeavor, Show No Mercy. An album that several years and dozens of plays later has not shown a hint of wear and is just as frenzied as it ever was. I had already written a tribute to this album, but now I feel a bit more detail is necessary to convey the unique quality and charm of this classic, that young metalheads may continue to seek it out early in their study of the great genre that is thrash metal. So without further adieu...Slayer Hour 1.\n\nThere\u2019s no arguing that Slayer was a massively influential band; the only other thrash band that can claim to be on the same scale is Metallica. But on Show No Mercy, Slayer was as much a product of their own influences as they were of direct innovation. Of these influences, Venom is the most prominent. The fast tempos, aggressive rhythms, and chaotic solos found all over this album are direct descendents of that manic British three-piece, as is Tom Araya\u2019s menacing singing style (yeah, he used to sing in these days) and the entire band\u2019s visual image and stage presentation, as evidenced by the liner photos. It\u2019s also a pretty goddamn raw effort, lacking the polished production of their later Def-American albums. This is, of course, in the album\u2019s favor: not only is the bass audible under the madness (if only barely) but the slight charismatic sloppiness (Dave Lombardo\u2019s drumming prowess is in its infancy) makes everything sound even more frantic. The general lyrical content, expanding on the band\u2019s satanic imagery with elements of battle and killing, is savage and violent and at times mind-boggling (\u201cSatanas sips upon the blood in which he feeds\u201d), but is never anything less than extremely awesome. Also worth mentioning is the cover art, most likely the first thing to inform you that this album is going to rule. What image in all of the band\u2019s history is more iconic than that? But while lots of bands were influenced by Venom, there is another key influence in the early Slayer formula that helped define the album as an inimitable classic.\n\nThat other direct influence audible on Show No Mercy is that of heavy metal gods Judas Priest. While this would be buried beneath the fury of future efforts, here it is in full display and is one of the main reasons that this is Slayer\u2019s most unique album. Though much of the riffage uses the Venom template of atonality and ravaged pentatonics, there\u2019s a subtle melodic edge to the King/Hanneman twin guitar attack that would later get abandoned for pure brutality. Take \u201cBlack Magic,\u201d a song mostly characterized by fast chromatic riffs, which has a major key riff appearing right after the second verse. Several choruses, particularly those of \u201cThe Antichrist\u201d and \u201cTormentor,\u2019 have melodic chord progressions and vocal lines. Even speedy, \u201cThe Final Command\u201d has more of a Priest-style speed metal vibe than a Venom one. There\u2019s also a lot of harmonized guitar lines, but unlike the more dissonant ones from their later albums, here they\u2019re more of a classic Tipton/Downing (or Smith/Murray) variety. The opening sequence of \u201cMetal Storm/Face the Slayer\u201d (in 9/8!), the middle break of \u201cCrionics,\u201d and just before the solos in \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d: these are among many examples of this throughout the album. Another key Judas Priest touch: Tom Araya\u2019s falsetto screams. Though he obviously doesn\u2019t have the control required to maintain melody lines in higher octaves like Halford, Tom knows the perfect locations in the vocal lines to add one of these ear-splitting wails to maximize effectiveness. Not on all their other albums combined are his screams so plentiful. A pity.\n\nBut for all the importance of their influences, there\u2019s still a hell of a lot of stuff on here that is pure Slayer, through and through. After all, neither Venom nor Priest were playing at the speeds of tracks like \u201cShow No Mercy,\u201d \u201cThe Final Command,\u201d or \u201cFight till Death.\u201d And neither of them thought to learn the attributes of the other: Priest was never this brutal and Venom was never this memorable. Actually, neither of them were this brutal or memorable over the course of an entire album. There\u2019s no filler whatsoever on Show No Mercy and every riff, be it simple (those of \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d) or surprisingly complex (those of \u201cMetal Storm/Face the Slayer,\u201d that end thing of \u201cCrionics\u201d), is perfectly written and placed, probably the reason it\u2019s the only album I know front-to-back. Usually I\u2019d pick some standouts, but everyone I know has different picks from this one. With songs as great as these, it\u2019s hard to play favorites.\n\nOh and before I forget. Best. Solos. Ever. Before they went on to pioneer the atonal shredding style that death metal would abuse into irrelevance, Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King did their damnedest to actually play well-written solos (another latent Priest influence I\u2019d say). And there\u2019s plenty of \u2018em, melodic, pentatonic, and atonal, throughout the album to keep the listener on the edge of their seat (climaxing in the \u201cCrionics\u201d solos, holy fucking shit are they killer). Think Slayer never had memorable guitar solos? Look no further.\n\n*Slayer Trivia: this is also the only album in which all of the guitars were tuned to E Standard. Immediately after this they\u2019d go to Eb Standard (also preferred by the likes of Yngwie) to make their riffs even more terrifying, a tuning they\u2019d keep until after Divine Intervention (after which, of course, they\u2019d go much lower). A small thing perhaps, but Standard tuning is certainly a reason why this album has the unique sound that it does. *\n\nA certifiable classic, even if it would be eclipsed by the albums that followed it. If you\u2019re even remotely interested in thrash/speed metal, this would be one of the first albums to get. In fact, you should have it already.\n",
        "\nWell, the title affirms that this truly is Slayer\u2019s comeback. Then why the low rating, you may ask? Well, for starters there are lots of rehashed riffs on here and some mallcore/hardcore riffs occasionally pop up too. Also, the guitar tone is far too downtuned for its own good. Imagine Reign In Blood \u2013 it starts off with nothing but some amazing tracks and ends in the same fashion. The songs sandwiched between these tracks are monotone and seamlessly meld into one 21 minute (approx.) track, and yet it has extremely memorable and absolutely crushing moments \u2013 which make Reign in Blood a winner. This album is quite similar, except the tracks between the opening two tracks and the closing two tracks aren\u2019t nearly as memorable or crushing and contain quite a lot of filler. The album was banned in India and many Asian countries due to its \u2018graphic\u2019 album cover and the supposedly disturbing and pro-terror stance on songs like \u2018Skeleton Christ\u2019 and \u2018Jihad\u2019 (And India has a population of which only 2% comprises of Christians, which makes this move all the more ludicrous).\n\nThankfully, that awful distortion on Tom\u2019s voice has been removed. Yet, Tom doesn\u2019t sound quite as strong as classic Slayer \u2013 still he performs decently on here. The riffing as mentioned earlier is an extremely modernized Reign-In-Blood crunch with the mall/hardcore riffs thrown in. Soloing is of course, classic Slayer tremolo scratch soloing (which isn\u2019t bad at all \u2013 although it is monotone), with the occasional excellent solo courtesy Hannenman. Dave Lombardo\u2019s back and one can immediately notices Lombardo\u2019s distinct crunch and galloping bass drums. Lombardo was and still remains one of the most exciting drummers in metal.\n\n\u2018Flesh Storm\u2019 starts off excellently. The track sounds incredibly like Angel Of Death and provides an insane headbanging experience. \u2018Catalyst\u2019 isn\u2019t quite as excellent, but still remains quite well. \u2018Skeleton Christ\u2019 sounds rather God Hates Us All like. The verses are quite boring with nu-metal riffing and the song rarely picks up and when it does, it doesn\u2019t last for long. \u2018Eyes Of The Insane\u2019 is abominable, with slow plodding verses without any riffing at all. It later picks up but doesn\u2019t quite kick off either, especially with that boring as heck beginning. \u2018Jihad\u2019 is decent although it ends rather horribly. \u2018Consfearacy\u2019 is a fast, belt-your-head-in number \u2013 classic Slayer with some nice soloing too. \u2018Catatonic\u2019 tries to be South Of Heaven, but ends up being an improvised Diabolus In Musica song. \u2018Black Serenade\u2019 sounds like \u2018Catatonic\u2019 but is much better, perhaps because it ends earlier and doesn\u2019t drag like its predecessor. Now, the album kicks into high gear again. \u2018Cult\u2019 which horrified me when I first heard it sounds a lot better here. It\u2019s a vicious song that could have been a Seasons In The Abyss out-take. It has a distinct crunch, awesome drumming and a great solo too. \u2018Supremist\u2019 is the perfect way to end the album. They let Lombardo take the charge here and he\u2019s absolutely perfect. The song has death metal overtones and incredible magnitude. The song swills into absolute and utter chaos at the end \u2013 Slayer of the old days would have been proud of this. On a musical level, this is undoubtedly the most impressive song on the album.\n\nThe album is a huge (and welcome) change in direction for Slayer although it still features some abominable mallcore moments. If they could extricate the nu-metal garbage, put on more songs like \u2018Flesh Storm\u2019, \u2018Supremist\u2019 and \u2018Cult\u2019 on here and change the guitar tone next time around \u2013 this album would definitely get an 80+ score. Till then, we can only wait.\n",
        "\nSlayer's long awaited 2006 album Christ Illusion has proven to me, after many eager listens to be about average. Firstly, it is obviously much faster and more thrashy than anything since Divine Intervention, but not nearly as good as that album. Kerry King's compositions surprisingly are much better than those of Hanneman/Araya, the two of them having written the slower 'Eyes of the Insane' and 'Black Serenade'. The latter has some decent riffs, but the former's ugly awkward chorus brings the catchy intro down to disappointment. Jihad is quicker and better, but tries too hard to be Mandatory Suicide at the end, which obviously isn't going to work. King's compositons are quicker, with the best being 'Supremist', 'Flesh Storm' and 'Cult'. With the exception of those three, the rest of the tracks are largely forgettable, especially 3-8.\n\nThe problem with this album lies in the unoriginality of about 90% of the riffs on here - they sound pretty rehashed. Songs come and go, with nothing memorable to speak of other than that they were fast ('Consfearacy', 'Skeleton Christ', 'Catatonic'). The best riffs on the album are found on 'Supremist', which is a completely brutal and fast closer (although the last minute could have been better), the verse riff of 'Cult', and the intro to 'Flesh Storm'. Lyrically, it is the same Kerry King shit that we've been hearing for the past 10 years. 'Cult', for all its riffage, has some terrible lyrics, as does 'Skeleton Christ'. Tom Araya's lyrics are clearly more well put together, but Jeff Hanneman's songs to back them don't compare to any of his earlier material, and is only on par with his contributions to 'Diabolicus in Musicia' and slghtly better than 'God Hates Us All'.\n\nThe instrument production is excellent, with the guitars no longer as grating rhythm or solo wise as they were on GHUA. Hanneman's solos are once again better than King's, but at least King seems to be laying off the whammy bar a bit. Dave Lombardo is back on drums, and is better than Paul Bostaph, with the quickness of many songs being attributed to his incredibly fast galloping double-bass patterns. Tom Araya's voice is in the foreground the whole album, and is turned up too loud on 'Catatonic' and 'Cult, but his singing is better and more aggressive than it has been for a long time. His bass is still pretty low in the mix, but is booming on certain parts of the album ('Cult', 'Supremist').\n\nWell...it is a new Slayer album, so check it out, but expect to be satisfied that this is only better than their last decade's output, and by itself, is only average music.\n\nBest tracks: 'Supremist', 'Cult', 'Flesh Storm'\n",
        "\nWhile not quite as bad as the album that follows it, Diabolus In Musica is pretty forgettable. It seems Slayer have attempted to make an album that sounds like Korn or System Of A Down. A lot of the thrash is gone in favour of groove riffs that sound like watered down Pantera. An unfortunate turn of events considering the quality of their earlier work.\n\nThings start off well enough with Bitter Peace. The beginning is pretty slow and it starts to become boring after about a minute. Thankfully, the song really picks up at the 1:33 mark and it thrashes along quite nicely. It\u2019s definitely the highlight here. The next six songs vary in quality from average (Stain Of Mind, Perversions Of Pain) to horrible (Death\u2019s Head, Love To Hate).\n\nThings pick up a bit with In The Name Of God. I like the riff and it has some pretty good drumming but it\u2019s nothing special. It sounds like something Fear Factory could have done apart from the solo of course. Scrum is a short brutal thasher and is a welcome relief from the tedium of the previous eight songs. Screaming From The Sky is a mid-paced song that isn\u2019t too bad. It just sounds like the band is going through the motions. The album does end on a good note with Point. Like the opening track, the beginning does drag a bit but it speeds up a bit quicker this time. Once it does, it\u2019s very enjoyable. It does slow down again in the middle but it speeds up again before the end. At least the song manages to hold your attention throughout. \n\nI don\u2019t recommend buying this album unless you\u2019re a Slayer fan. There\u2019s only 3 good songs and a couple of ok ones. The rest is pretty forgettable. This is definitely a case of downloading a few songs rather than buying the whole thing.\n",
        "\nBecause it sounds as though they were the ones who made it. That\u2019s right, folks. Slayer have really gone down the deep end with this one. I thought Diabolus In Musica was pretty mediocre but this one manages to be even worse! This time, there\u2019s only a couple of good songs and only one of them really stands out. \n\nThe first song, Disciple, is by far the best song on here. It's got the album's best riffs and Tom Araya actually manages to sound alright on this one. The same can't be said for later songs but we'll get to that in due course. The main problem I have with this album starts to become apparent here. The lyrics. Sure, Slayer have never had truly amazing lyrics but they are capable of doing better than this! The worst thing is the use of excessive swearing. Slayer have used swearing before on previous album but here it's just overkill! It seems like they're using it just to fill in the blanks for lyrics (Payback is the worst offender). \n\nThe second song, God Send Death is also fairly good. The lyrics are probably the best on the album and it definitely has the best solo section. Good stuff. After this however, you might as well stop listening to the CD because you've heard the best this has to offer. The only other decent song on here is Bloodline. Tom Araya put in his best vocal performance of the album and his voice doesn't have the annoying distortion that plagues many of the songs on here. He sounds pretty tired on this album for the most part. And he really should stop trying to do high pitched screams because he clearly can't do that well anymore. Seven Faces is proof of that. \n\nAside from the songs I mentioned earlier, this album has some very nu-metal sounding riffs. Threshold is the most nu-metal song on here. It's not quite the worst thing on here though. That honour would go to such boring songs as Cast Down and Deviance. This is some of the most awful material in the band's entire catalogue. Payback sounds like Slipknot's attempt to cover something from Reign In Blood. If it was played in standard tuning and had different lyrics, it might have not been so bad. As it stands, it's a pretty weak ending to the album. \n\nDon\u2019t bother buying this album. This is the only studio album of theirs which really is not worth having. Diabolus In Musica isn\u2019t much better but at least it has decent lyrics and a few more good songs. Just download Disciple, God Send Death and maybe Bloodline and forget about the rest.\n",
        "\nIf you were to go in the dictionary and look up \u201cmixed bag\u201d, this album should be somewhere amidst the top of the definitions. I held absolutely no expectations for this album nor did I intend on letting their previous disappointments prevent from a fair and unbiased review of these former thrash titans. My main concern is that about half of this album is comprised of music (I\u2019m being very generous on this one) that belongs on a Slipknot album or in metalcore. There is still a fair abundance of thrash tendencies, solid headbanging metal riffage, and aggressive, technical drumming. Which leads me to believe that this album could have been created for the sole purpose of creating a median point between their old and new fans. \n\nThe album opens with Flesh Storm after some trademark feedback, rolls into a competent opening thrashing riff. No arguing this album and song for that matter has thrash, good mid-tempo melodic riffs and punishing Araya vocals and SOLO\u2019s. Its great, almost sounds classic but something seems missing. Great start. Catalyst begins with an absolutely heathenous riff and settles with a excellent blend of classic old Slayer and mid-tempo modernized metal riffs. Classic. This sounded to have the promise of an amazing thrash comeback album and then.. Eyes of The Insane or what I like to call Bloodline light. Its slow, plodding, welcome back GHUA. Not even a Marty Friedman solo could saved this song. The guitar solo\u2019s in the middle are quite well done but the riffs are just far too bland and nu sounding for my tastes. \n\nJihad begins and I find myself reaching for anything to prevent going into a state of comatose. The song eventually picks up but the riffs sound like C-sides from their classic days. Consistent with the rest of the weak tracks the solo and drums remain the highlight. Tom Araya or his lyrical prowess(lack thereof) cannot save tracks on his own. Skeleton Christ the riffs drift from the nu or watered down side and almost sound akin to what I\u2019d expect to hear on the latest Killswitch Engage album. What is with that riff at 3:24? Slaycore? Sheesh. You begin to notice how infinitely weak their solo\u2019s are with poor riffing eh? \n\nConsfearacy works much better sounding more akin to Divine Intervention with some very solid headbanging speed riffing. Great track. Black Serenade is mid-paced slower song with decent neck wrecking main riff and vocals for about half of it. Still far superior to their previous works so I\u2019ll give it a mediocre. Cult isn\u2019t a bad song per se, it has some good riffs with a really annoying chorus line and some solid drumming great solo\u2019s to back it up. Good track, baaaaad chorus. Supremist, now this song is a juggernaut of a song if I\u2019ve ever heard one. Not in the traditional Slayer sense, this has excellent chug riffs, tremolo picked riffs, solos and sick drumming courtesy of Lombardo. This has become an instant favorite Slayer song of mine. The ending is slow and pure evil. This is how GHUA should have sounded. This song gets 40 points itself. \n\nTo conclude you have two classics, some pretty good riff work, some above average drumming courtesy of Dave Lombardo whose presence was felt although I feel people make too big of a deal about his contributions on the album. Could have been a ploy to bring old fans back regardless of musical content which leads me more this to be a calculated effort with a fair amount of filler riffs that might catch the attention of the new crowd. What else can I say it\u2019s the Slayer album I can\u2019t help but like and despise at the same time. From a musical level, the highlights(mainly Supremist) lift this album to a B grade, but I would NOT highly recommend this album openly for reasons stated previously.\n",
        "\nAfter five long years the new Slayer album has finally arrived. After the not-so-well-received God Hates Us All, Slayer had only one direction to go in, and that was up. While I personally enjoyed God Hates Us All, I think Christ Illusion is an improvement. The production is not overdone like its predecessor, and all the instruments sound great together. The drums could be a bit louder on some songs, but otherwise are at a good volume. The bass is also very audible, which I find a lot of times does not happen on a lot of albums; it seems to be the \u201cforgotten\u201d instrument.\n\nSlayer has continued with their anti-Christian/anti-religion image. In the 80s they were more of a satanic band than an anti-religious band. While this album is definitely dominated by that theme, it seems they\u2019re trying to slightly bring back the satanic image. This album is the first time they\u2019ve mentioned Satan by name since South of Heaven (Read Between the Lies), along with the (hilarious) screaming of 666! in the song Cult. Of course they\u2019ve always maintained their \u201cevil\u201d and \u201csatanic\u201d content in their 90s albums, it just seems more apparent in this one. With all that being said, it is a very good anti-religious album. For the most part, the lyrics are very well written. A definite improvement over God Hates Us All. The song Cult is one of my favourite anti-religious songs ever, though I think the 666 part should have been left out; I just don\u2019t think it fits in with the song.\n\nThe one major downside of this album is the vocals. They literally \u201cvokill\u201d it. Araya\u2019s vocals have deteriorated over the years and it really shows on this album. In certain parts it sounds so bad I can\u2019t take him seriously. As much as I love Slayer (they\u2019re my favourite band of all time) I think it would be better for them to stop making albums, tour for a few years (surprisingly enough Araya\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t nearly as bad live) and then just call it quits. Obviously they cannot replace Araya; Slayer just wouldn\u2019t be Slayer without him. If it weren\u2019t for the horrid vocals, this album would be very, very good. They\u2019re not the worst vocals I have ever heard, but for Slayer, they\u2019re the worst. The structuring of the vocals for quite a few of the songs sounds like they came right off Divine Intervention. Just listen to Cult and tell me the singing doesn\u2019t sound like something off Divine Intervention.\n\nThe music isn\u2019t as \u201cheavy\u201d or as distorted as it was on God Hates Us All. Slayer has thankfully dropped a lot of the Slipknot influence. It\u2019s still there but not nearly as much as before. The return of Lombardo is certainly an improvement. Bostaph was a good drummer, no argument there, but Lombardo is just better. The snare/tom roll in the intro of Cult is awesome, and fits perfectly with the guitars; it really lets you know the song is about to begin, and does it ever. The double-bass in Supremist compliments the song very well. They weren\u2019t very audible at first, but once I listened to it a few times I could hear them and they enhanced the song. \n\nOne unfortunate thing is the guitar solos aren\u2019t that memorable. I can\u2019t really remember any that stuck out to me other than the one in Catalyst and the one in Supremist. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re not good, they just seem to lack that memorable aspect that is usually present in a lot of their solos. They\u2019re also not nearly as chaotic as on their previous albums. Perhaps King and Hanneman are succumbing to the same thing Araya is: age. The guitars though sound well throughout most of the album. There are thrashy parts here and there, and some Slipknot-influenced parts as well. As mentioned before the bass is very pronounced and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nAs a huge Slayer fan, was I unhappy with this album? No. Was I ecstatic? Certainly not. I think their only album worse than this one is Divine Intervention. Even though I said it\u2019s an improvement over God Hates Us All, at this point in time I still rather listen to that album than this one. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve listened to it a million times and it was the album that got me into Slayer, and I just find it really catchy. I haven\u2019t purchased this album yet, but I definitely intend to. It\u2019s not a bad album, but it\u2019s also not a great album. It\u2019s just good. It has the signature Slayer feel to it. If you like Slayer then I recommend at least listening to this album. If you\u2019re new to Slayer then check out their earlier albums first, most notably their 80s material and work your way up to this one.\n",
        "\nSlayer's long-awaited \"comeback\" album is precisely what one might expect from the band who just recently released the dregs that were Diabolus in Musica and God Hates Us All. Now, if these two weren\u2019t horrid enough in their complete lack of depth or authenticity, we are subjected to Christ Illusion, a culmination of essentially all of the band\u2019s pop-art work over the last 10 years or so. For those like myself, who would gladly kneel before the throne and grovel in homage to the might and brilliance of what Slayer had managed to achieve in the mid to late 80\u2019s (South of Heaven primarily), it\u2019s not difficult to assess their current state of shameless commercialism.\n\nOne of the most irritating aspects of the album is its packaging. Speaking metaphorically, listening to this album is like opening a birthday present wrapped in shiny gold paper only to discover a box filled with charcoal. The album cover in itself provides an ample precursor of this marketing ploy; the artwork is clearly intended to be reminiscent of pre-mallcore albums, with a return of the old logo as well. As one might logically assume, the music and accompanying thematic elements work under the same basic concept; some songs vaguely resemble genuine thrash metal, but upon closer inspection are completely superficial and obviously worship the god of mediocrity. \n\nThe main goal here that will make this album to incredibly successful with Slayer\u2019s newly-garnered gathering of loyal radio-rock adolescent followers, is realized with the ability to create musical pieces which loosely hold your interest, but then quickly descend into the exact same formless sap-riffs that we\u2019ve all come to know and love from God Hates Us All. In essence, it\u2019s not totally horrid when dissected into individual phrases, but falls entirely to pieces when looked at as a whole. There was once a time when King and Hanneman would marvelously trade off fluid and creative guitar leads, and Dave Lombardo would add equally invigorating drum fills honed with innovative cymbal work. Now, we have a bunch of two-finger 10-second guitar \u201csolos,\u201d with absolutely nothing in which to make them interesting or memorable. Similarly, in spite of Lombardo\u2019s return to the band after almost 15 years absence, the drumming is there, it\u2019s fast, it borrows from some \u201cnew age\u201d styles such as blasting, but nothing augmented which would make it truly captivating or inspiring.\n\nObviously borrowing heavily from favored tour mates Slipknot, the lyrics rarely move beyond the realm of melancholy and interpersonal angst. Of course this isn\u2019t in any way a new development, as we\u2019ve seen basically the exact same thing from Slayer\u2019s latest two developments. While there are certainly several anti-Christian and pseudo-satanic diatribes presented, they are so pathetic and laughable within the context of the remainder of the album, it\u2019s nearly impossible to take them seriously. Relatively speaking, it\u2019s not quite as blatantly idiotic as Exodus\u2019 post-millennium material, but trying to write lyrics with mountains of profanity geared to mildly offend the greatest number of people does not represent an intelligent ideological statement. \n\nAge-old thrash bands can perform partially successful necromancy on their good albums all they want and still not be able to hide their product-oriented mentality, as Christ Illusion clearly displays. Slayer, together with their Bay Area thrash mates, and most of the German bands following suite, have successfully turned thrash metal into a bloated, commercialized shell of itself, ready to be packaged and sold to drooling mall goers across the globe.\n",
        "\nFirst off I'd like to make clear that I am anything but a Slayer fan. 'South Of Heaven' was an amazing album, but overall, I think they are slightly overrated. Surely they have made some great songs and 'Show No Mercy', 'Hell Awaits', the severely overrated 'Reign In Blood' and 'Seasons In The Abyss' were decent Thrash albums, but I personally think they miss that something that made a band like Forbidden or OverKill such an awesome Thrash band. In addition, they definitely test the patience of their fans by having very long intervals between their last few albums, which were bad to mediocre anyway.\n\nBut if you ARE a Slayer fan, your patience will probably be rewarded this time! I never thought I would ever say this again, but 'Christ Illusion' is the best album Slayer has made since 'South Of Heaven', it's a lot more old school than the previous albums as well.\n\nA quick check-up for the old Slayer-elements. Fast and heavy guitar riffs? Check! Intense drumming? Check! Guitar solos that are terribly off-key? Check! More than three riffs a song? Check! An album cover that looks like it's been drawn by a five year old? Check! And the bad lyrics? Worse than ever!\n\nThere are some things here that could be taken really negatively, but these are trade marks for Slayer. I'm not saying that 'Christ Illusion' is back at the level of 'South Of Heaven' or 'Hell Awaits', but it's closest they have gotten the last 16 years. Part of that could be the return of Dave Lombardo. Not that Paul Bostaph was a bad drummer (on the contrary...after he left Forbidden, there was really something missing), but it's a remarkable coincidence that they got back to their old sound now that Lombardo has returned.\n\nFirst things first...this album isn't a full blown Thrash fest from beginning to end. 'Eyes Of The Insane' is a mediocre track in the vein of the last two albums and 'Jihad' starts out interestingly, has some killer riffs, but gets a little too repetitive in the end, which causes the song to get really boring near the end. It goes wrong in the last minute, I'm sure there could have been something better there, which is really too bad, because the rest of the song really ain't that bad! Coincidentally enough, both of these songs have been written by Jeff Hanneman, who has in the past written most of the songs I consider Slayer's best. The vast majority of the album has been written by the other guitarist, Kerry King.\n\nLet's get back to the positive news then! The album starts out with a killer track called 'Flesh Storm'. There are some really nice riffs in this old-school sounding track. Most of the song is fast, but there are some time-feel changes throughout the song, which keeps it interesting. No complaints here! It's no 'War Ensemble', but pretty damn close!\n\n'Catalyst' is also a fast, old school track which could have fit anywhere on 'Seasons In The Abyss'. Tom Araya, who I consider a really bad singer, but quite fitting for Slayer, actually excels in this song. He knows just where the vocal tracks need a little more power and where they should be a little lower. Very cool!\n\nUp next is one of my personal favorites off the album, it's called 'Skeleton Christ' and it contains some of the coolest riffs ever written by mr. King. Some nice staccato work there, and Dave Lombardo's drumming fits those riffs perfectly. It's that kind of stop-and-go staccato work. The tempo changes in this song are awesome as well. Judging from the lyrics, Kerry King has probably found his anger caused by religion again and even though I think the choice of words is a little childish in that subject, but hey...we're used to that aren't we?\n\nAfter the less interesting moment of the album ('Eyes Of The Insane' and 'Jihad'), we're back to the speedy, pissed-off moments again. 'Consfearacy' isn't exactly one of the highlights of the album, but it's definitely a nice track for people who prefer Slayer fast, heavy and angry. There's this punk-ish energy to the song, which would make the song quite fitting on 'Undisputed Attitude'.\n\nWhat I have always liked about Slayer were the songs that were slightly \"different\" on the albums. That's the very reason why 'Dead Skin Mask', 'Crionics' and 'Seasons In The Abyss' are among my favorite songs the band has ever made. 'Catatonic' will most probably be in that same list soon. The mid-tempo song is doomy and intense, features some very interesting drum work by Dave Lombardo, especially in the middle part, where he goes wild on his toms, and once again features a relatively stellar role for Tom Araya's vocals. I think the guys in the band understand that it's songs like these that keep a furthermore fast and Thrashy album interesting.\n\nSo off to another one of my favorite tracks of the album. 'Black Serenade' features some killer guitar riffs, courtesy of Jeff Hanneman, who makes up for the two monsters he created earlier on the album with this song. There is a dangerous atmosphere in this song, which most reminds me of the atmosphere set on 'Hell Awaits'. There are some killer rhythm changes, which is always a pro for me. When they are executed right, that is, but that is definitely the case with 'Black Serenade'. Thumbs up!\n\nSince it was the first track that could be heard of the album, there has been a lot of discussion about 'Cult'. Personally, I have said that I liked the song right from the beginning. Sure, there's this childish anti-religion lyrical content once again, but the music is killer. There are a lot of changes in this song and whenever there is a change, it is a change into a great riff. I seriously don't understand what the crap was all about, it's a song that would have fit perfectly on 'Seasons In The Abyss'. It probably would have outdone several tracks that actually are on that album.\n\nWhat a smart move of the band to save the best for last! It's really unbelievable what they do in 'Supremist'. To be honest, I didn't think they would have been able to do a song like this. It's amazing! The perfect finale for this album! From the awesome opening riff on, I had the feeling this was going to be something special. And that feeling didn't betray me. The bass is actually audible and good on this track, the riffs are probably the best on the entire album (maybe excluding those to 'Skeleton Christ'...ask again later) and what did I just hear...? Blastbeats by Dave Lombardo! That same man does a great job during the entire song, probably the most interesting rhythms I've ever heard him do. 'Supremist' also houses a lot of changes and once again, they're executed excellently. And to conclude the whole thing in style, the ending of the song is doomy, chaotic and pissed off! That's the way to do it!\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, the production to the album is flawless as well! The band's choice for Josh Abraham, previously responsible for the albums of i.e. Linkin Park, raised some eyebrows at first, but the final outcome shows that there probably couldn't have been a better choice. He's given the drums as well as the guitars the incredibly dry sound they need and that gives the album a little extra! Let's put it like this, the album would probably have gotten 5 points less from me if it didn't have this production.\n\nSo what's my conclusion? Well, to be short and simple: Slayer has impressed me! And I'm not really a fan of theirs, but I am a fan of Thrash Metal and that is exactly what you get when you put on this album. Recommended to anyone who has a heart filled with Thrash Metal!\n",
        "\nAfter listening to this album, I think it's safe to say that Dave Lombardo is the only drummer that belongs in Slayer. Not to say that Paul Bostaph was bad (in some elements he was better than Lombardo) but Lombardo definitely brings back a lot more of that 'Slayer' feel than has been there for a very, very long time.\n\nLet's look at Bostaph's contributions. Divine Intervention was undisputedly the best post-Lombardo work of Slayer. Lots of speed, pretty consistent songwriting despite a lack of classics or standouts. Diabolus was noticably slower, like South of Heaven, but not nearly as good and with a lot of modern experimentation. Only a few songs worked, others had their moments, but overall it was a quite lackluster release. GHUA had some of the most ridiculous and pointlessly vulgar Slayer lyrics yet, and really only held three standouts (the classic Disciple being the only amazing point of the album). The rest, like Diabolus, had a lot of more modern experimentation (comparisons to Slipknot often drawn) and usually didn't work.\n\nSo here we are, a tedious 5 years after GHUA, and we have Christ Ilusion. Larry Caroll (designing this album's art as he did with the unholy trilogy of RIB/SOH/SITA) and Dave Lombardo in tow, Slayer seemed set to release their best album since Seasons and reclaim that classic sound they used to have.\n\nI can say that for the most part this has been achieved. This is clearly the best album since Seasons (although Divine Intervention is really not far behind). There's more speed then there has been since Divine Intervention, and there's just much better songwriting overall. I don't really see the comparisons to War Ensemble, but Flesh Storm starts the album off in speedy/catchy fashion, followed closely by the similarly fast Catalyst. Skeleton Christ has a chugging riff that is better than just about any of the midpaced material off of Diabolus/GHUA, and features some truly catchy and evil riffs. Eyes of the Insane...lord knows why Slayer chose this one as the video. Although the song isn't completely bad, it is clearly the worst on the album and really doesn't go anywhere. Jihad is a song that seems to grow on you and is currently my favorite on the album. Very fast and full of classic Slayer riffage (is it a coincidence that my favorite song on this album is written by Jeff Hanneman?...I think not, I think he deserves a lot more credit than all the attention that Kerry King gets). Consfearacy is another speedy number, much akin to the first two songs. Catatonic is one of the BEST slow Slayer songs ever (mostly due to the fact that isn't oppresively boring and the ending riff is brutal as hell). Black Serenade is another evil little number written by Jeff, with a catchy if not overused chorus. Cult features some of Slayer's dumbest lyrics ever (Religion is a whore?...cmon Kerry, enuff's enuff), but despite this remains a riff-fest and is a pretty fun listen. Supremist is the first Slayer song to feature blast beats and closes the album in fashion.\n\nOverall, this album is extremely fast and brutal, mostly on par with Divine Intervention in that it's extremely consistent (far more so than DIM/GHUA were) but seemingly lacks truly classic tracks that we find on older Slayer material. Jihad and Cult may be the new classics from this release...maybe. It's too soon to say.\n\nBottom line-the best since SITA, and Lombardo is with them once again. Coincidence..? I think not. Lombardo is one big key to the 'classic' Slayer sound. Kudos to Slayer for putting their last two releases to shame and making something in the old vein again.\n",
        "\nYeah, what we got here is the best album since Divine Intervention. Indeed, we all know Slayer's recent mallcore infested abominations, but Christ Illusion is the first step into the right direction. \n\nThe preceding single \"Cult\" showed a few good glimpses of the album, but didn't do it the deserved justice. \"Cult\" tended to sound like a watered down Divine Intervention at times, which obviously bothered many, even though it was an improvement over the quite hideous God Hates Us All. \n\nNow, excuse me for not waiting until the album is released (which would be another week or so) but I tend to be careful with modern Slayer releases. Well, so I'm glad I bothered to check it out. Read on to find out exactly why. \n\nThe album starts with \"Flesh Storm\". Well, what an adequate title. It begins with a feedback, slowly fading into quite a thrash riff! No, it's not as fast as Reign in Blood, but it would easily fit onto Divine Intervention. Hey, who's drumming here? It sounds damn fine! Yeah, if you didn't hear it already, you must've been living under a rock for quite some time - Dave Lombardo is back. Now, I really enjoyed Paul Bostaph's drumming on Divine Intervention, but it's always nice to see some legends back in the band. Another improvement you'll be able to hear instantly is Tom Araya's voice. No stupid fucking around with dumb effects anymore, just an angry yell we haven't heard since...Seasons in the Abyss? Yeah. That's is quite an accomplishment for the old fellow. \n\nThe fast thrash riff leads us into a slower groovy riff with catchy vocal lines on top before the thrash reappears, but with a nice and short typical Slayer-solo added this time 'round! The song reaches it's climax with the solo on about 2:40. I'm sure you haven't heard solos like that in ages. It's fast, semi-melodic and still whammy-bar driven like in the early days. The song had quite an impact on me when I heard it first. No signs of mallcore to be found. \n\nI was still afraid that they could let me down with the second song, \"Catalyst\". Well, I stopped worrying when I heard the intro. \"Catalyst\" starts with another nice thrash riff and leads into another short and pretty swell solo section. Hey, we only heard 5 minutes of new Slayer so far, and already 3 solos? Impressive. The song switches between nice single note thrashing and a few brooding, headbangable riffs. Catchy as fuck. Araya's vocals are very nice again, especially the passage starting around 2:20 is so catchy \"You know what I know, no matter what you say, you've been beaten today, like every other day...\" Trust me, you'll sing along with him after the second listen. \n\nYou shouldn't forget that Slayer released crappy albums before this. So you can't expect that their songwriting skills are suddenly entirely flawless again. A testament for this is sadly the next song: \n\n\"Eyes of the Insane\" \n\nFrom the beginning, something just doesn't sound right (except for Dave's drumming, which is especially stellar here). The song is very slow but it already becomes boring after the riff gets repeated for more than once. The real problem starts with what's supposed to be half of a \"chorus\". The \"riff\" underneath consists of a few rapidly changed power chords, which get repeated over and over. Maybe that is still a reminder of Kerry King's Slipknot worship before God Hates Us All was released. The only keeper in the song is the nice solo in the middle. As long as you ignore the supporting \"riff\" underneath. The song is not AS horrible as it might sound, but it's definitely a lot weaker than it's two preceding songs.\n\nToo bad that the next weak song follows immediately after it. \"Jihad\" might already be known to some, because it could be heard somewhere (forgot where, to be honest). \"Jihad\" is better than \"Eyes of the Insane\". But not by a great margin. It consists of some faster half-thrash riffs. Half- thrash in the sense that the rhythm starts like thrash but ends on groove notes. Might work for early Pantera, but not quite for Slayer. It picks up towards the end and a nice solo comes in, while the ending is just a lead guitar riff with march drumming below and a speech sample on top. A mediocre song. \n\nLuckily, Christ Illusion picks up again with the next song, \"Skeleton Christ\". \n\nIts main riff is very groovy and headbangable and transcends into another thrash riffs shortly later, before the main riff returns with a short solo on top. They really brought back the solos on here. The song remains fairly strong until a nice riff changes the song quite a bit. It's again very catchy and the melody's quite infectious until another solo forces it's way into the song, and again - it's very welcome. The song ends with a nice groove and screaming leads on top. Nice finish. \n\nThen it's time to put on some thrash again. \"Consfearacy\" starts in a high-speed manner and breaks into a fast solo almost immediately. Classic Thrash, Slayer style. The riffs in this one are among the best that the album has to offer; I'd say it's the most brutal and straightforward thrasher we heard yet on this album. Solo after solo follows, the riffs never slow down. The song is fast throughout, almost reaching Reign in Blood speed. No, I'm not kidding. \"Consfearacy\" surely's going to be another fan favourite. \n\nAnother midpaced track follows, but don't worry, \"Black Serenade\" is done right. The song's vocal lines and riffs are some of the catchier ones in the Slayer catalogue. Sometimes they switch into some serious thrashing, which happens mostly when a solo approaches. Like the one shortly after the minute mark. Great stuff. The overall speed reminds one of the slower tracks on Seasons in the Abyss for a bit. \n\n\"South of Heaven\" follows. Oh, wait! No, the track is called \"Catatonic\". The lead guitar work on the song's intro could've been taken from \"South of Heaven\". You remember the \"evil\" atmosphere those leads had? The riff that comes in at 2:30 sounds great alone already, but when Dave's drum patters follow shortly after, it really sounds good. Then, another evil harmonized riff and \"South of Heaven\" calls again. The riff at 3:20 is almost moshpit worthy. Pretty great track.\n\n\"Cult\" starts rather unspectacular. Then when the first \"real\" riff starts it sounds quite nice, but it's a bit watered down afterwards. A somewhat punkish interlude follows but turns into a second-rate thrash riff afterwards. Nowhere close to the riffage in the other thrash assaults we heard so far. The soloing is the best part of the song. Not the best solos on the album, but about average, which is quite good on this album. The song crawls along without any particular standouts, until the riff under the solo at about 3:20. The solo rules, as well as the riff underneath it. The song's worth it because of that short passage. Why this one was chosen as the initiate single is beyond me, but I'm glad they didn't take \"Eyes of the Insane\" or \"Jihad\" instead. \n\nWell, but they kept the best goddamn song for the end. \"Supremist\" could have been on Reign in Blood. I'm not kidding. Listen to the damn thrash riff. It's fast as fuck, but something unique in the Slayer catalogue comes right after afterwards. The great riff is repeated again - with blastbeats underneath. I can't remember that Slayer had used this technique before (please correct me IF they did, but I don't think so), but it fits SO DAMN well into song! Some slower passages follow afterwards, mainly power chord driven, but very well done with great drumming in support. If that wasn't enough, a thrash break follows at 1:35, and it's devastating. It makes your neck snap and is followed by one of the best solos on the whole album and you can't help but get off your chair and thrash around like a maniac. After the solo, Tom screams \"Must men take control of the weak!?\" which leads us into a great slower, headbangable passage with soaring leads on top of it. It lasts until the end and closes the album in the best way possible. \n\nThe production is very nice overall. The online version of \"Cult\" had the guitars and drums toned down and the vocals and bass too upfront, which made a few fans afraid of how the production would turn out. Don't worry, it's a lot better than I expected. It's powerful, yet dirty and raw enough. Very fitting for a Thrash Metal release. I'd say it reminds me of typical 1990 thrash album production, which is indeed very fine. \n\nWhat else is to say about Christ Illusion? Well, my expectations were easily topped and finally, these four guys seem to be in good shape again and don't sound like they want to retire anytime soon. I can only hope that Slayer will continue to release albums in this vein.\n\nOverall, Christ Illusion is a recommended listen for anyone who abandoned Slayer after Divine Intervention and for any thrash metal fan, be it modern or not. It's not flawless (\"Eyes of the Insane\" and \"Jihad\" come to mind) but shows many signs of their former glory. \n\nRecommendations: \n\nFlesh Storm, Catalyst, Consfearacy, Catatonic and Supremist.\n",
        "\nLet me start by saying although I do love Slayer, I've never been a huge fan per se, so this is review is not coming from the perspective of a fanboy. The only albums of theirs I have are Reign in Blood and God Hates Us All (the former I like, the latter...eh, not so much), so I can't really compare this to their previous material other than to say that it sounds more like RiB than GHUA.\n\nThat said, let's take a look at this new song that took them five years to come up with.\n\nFirst of all, the positive side:\n\nThe intro is pretty damn cool, and it's nice to hear them doing some progression instead of the appalling simplicity that dragged down about 2/3 of the songs on GHUA. The first thing I noticed is how much better the guitar tone is than on the latest album. That in itself is a plus for me, but not only do the guitars sound better, they're also playing decent, memorable riffs again. Not riffs to shit oneself over, mind you, but decent all the same. The main thing is they have a little bit of that evil sound to them that the riffs on God Hates Us All sorely lacked. Oh yeah, and there are pretty good solos, too. Yes, solos, plural, because there are multiple solos in this one song...a little trick that Slayer seemed to have forgotten you could do.\n\nThe best news, however, is the fact that Tom Araya actually sounds good. Gone is the distorted Slipknot shouting of the previous release, and back is the harsh thrash-yell that he used in the early days. If he does the whole next album this way, it should actually be listenable - which is more than can be said for God Hates Us All.\n\nAnd now for the negatives:\n\nDespite improvements, \"Cult\" is still haunted by a shadow of the bad songwriting into which Slayer appeared to have descended by 2001. It's not quite as disjointed as some of their other songs, but it seems a bit unfocused. That and well, it's sort of a mediocre song as a whole. It may be inestimably better than anything they put on their last album, but that still doesn't mean its anything special objectively speaking.\n\nAnd then there are the lyrics. Pretty silly, and nothing we haven't heard before - but then again, if I cared too much about lyrics, I probably wouldn't be listening to Slayer in the first place.\n\nSo there you have it. If I were to compare this to God Hates Us All, I'd probably give it a 90; if I were to compare it to Reign in Blood, maybe only a 25. Objectively, I give it a 50 because it's good but unspectacular...and also because only putting one song on a CD single is kind of lame. Throw in a cover, a re-recorded old song, or a b-side or something. We're not picky.\n",
        "\nThis is my favorite Slayer album. I hope one day it will be yours too.\n\nWhen most people think of Slayer, Reign in Blood obviously comes to mind. Reign in Blood is obviously a classic, but this album excels at keeping each individual song memorable by differentiating them amongst each other. Instead of a bunch of riffs and solos stuck between two memorable songs like on Reign in Blood (some awesome riffs/solos though), Hell Awaits manages to have some sort of intro and/or ending to most of the songs, when it\u2019s appropriate. This could be called Slayer\u2019s only \u2018progressive\u2019 album considering the somewhat long song lengths and effectively structured arrangements. Aside from the mandatory excellent riffage, the drumming on this album is superb as well. The other salient feature of this album is it\u2019s extremely dark atmosphere, much like the song Black Magic, from the previous album, which contrasts to the extreme violence of Reign in Blood. This album obviously influenced legions of both death and black metal bands. Hell Awaits also has the best lyrics of any Slayer album as well, especially songs like Kill Again and At Dawn they Sleep (read the lyrics). Along with great cover art and a perfect title, you have a classic album.\n\nAs I mentioned before, one of the main strengths of the album is it\u2019s differentiated songs. The first five songs are all classics, while the final two are very listenable, don\u2019t offer much special, with the exception of the last song ending in a similar fashion that this first track begins in. Most people would probably point to this one as one of their favorites. It was my first favorite song on the album, but as I listened to it more and more I realized it was only the beginning. Unlike Judas Priest, Slayer is keeping it real by putting backmasking on their records on purpose! Most people already know about the hidden message that says \u2018join us\u2019 when played backwards. This leads into the guitars chunking away at the E string interweaving with trademark angular Slayer melodies. Lombardo offers some pretty doomish drum patterns which all build up to the song until it reaches a break riff and then goes into a full on thrash assault. This continues to build up to the refrain, which is actually much better on the live recordings considering in that context it\u2019s more of a yell\u2026and who doesn\u2019t like to yell HELL AWAITS!? The riffs on this track aren\u2019t as memorable as some of the others, but the song serves mostly to set the epic feel of the album.\n\nKill Again is Slayer\u2019s best song about serial killers. Forget Dead Skin Mask. In contrast to the opening track, it offers a much more immediate sense of urgency, starting off with frenetic riffing and never letting up for the entire song. Among the opening salvo of riffs, the tremolo riff starting at 0:25 is particularly interesting since it elicits the feeling of a serial killer chasing around his victims. The same is true about the riff at 1:15, except not until the drums come in. Soon after that the lyrics come in \u201cSlice Her Flesh To Shreds/Watch The Blood Flow Free\u201d etc.. So much for Reign in Blood being the first death metal album. The last second of the song is perfect to sing along to as well.\n\nAt Dawn They Sleep might just be Slayer\u2019s best song ever. Angel of Death and Reign in Blood are great songs but they don\u2019t have the interesting song structure that this one does. After the classic opening riff, there is a brief pause so you can set your neck on auto pilot for the next few minutes given the perfect mid tempo pair of riffs. The lyrics on this one are great too, as well as unintentionally hilarious nonsense: \u201cdarkness is my slave/taste the sins of hell.\u201d After some soling, the intro riff comes back, but finishes off with a trademark extended Slayer \u201cmelody.\u201d This slows the tempo, which builds up tension, running through a few more killer riffs. When this song is played live, Araya, some times mumbles \u2018kill\u2019 during the instrumental breaks, encouraging the audience to sing along. When the song is reduced to two power chords slowly building in tempo, the last words of the lyrics are \u2018KILL KILL KILL.\u2019 This is used the exact same way that the \u2018DIE DIE DIE\u2019 audience participation in Metallca\u2019s classic Creeping Death is used, although it shouldn\u2019t be confused with their \u201cKILL KILL KILL KILL\u201d lyrics to the abombination All Within My Hands. Anyway, at this point in the song, a new fast riff is introduced and then the drums and bass come in launching the song into another full speed thrasher. Another riff with some melodic variation comes in next and then on the last word of \u201cThey Must Drain Your Soul Of LIFE!\u201d a perfect slide introduces the solo, just to keep the insane pace up. When the soloing is over, there is interplay between two riffs: the less melodic of the two fills up the space between it\u2019s counterpart, but this space is gradually closed shorter and shorter at each interval, building up more tension. When it is finally played twice in a row, everything stops for a quick drum interlude, which itself stops abruptly, and then the main riff finished off one of Slayer\u2019s greatest songs.\n\nAt this point of the album I am ready for anything. The song Praise of Death carries the momentum of the previous song perfectly. Much like Reign in Blood, this song offers one solo short solo after the next. The juxtaposition of this song against At Dawn They Sleep reminds me of how Lord of All Fevers and Plague follows the song Maze of Torment by Morbid Angel on their album Altars of Madness. Much like At Dawn they Sleep, Maze of Torment is the best song on the album, and Lord of All Fevers and Plague flows so perfectly after it by offering a steam roller pace and relatively uncomplicated song structures with relentless soloing. Anyway, the song starts off with a tom hit and then a fast tremolo riff, followed by Slayer melodies tacked on to the end, as usual. The fourth time this happens, they extend the melody, catching the listener off guard, sort of like when they used the intro riff in the middle of the song for the second time, except this time the pitch descends. This is one of my favorite moments on the album and is perfectly backed up by the bass and drums, which really give it a punch. It\u2019s hard to explain and even harder to explain the feeling that it elicits, but it somehow makes the pace even more frantic. The song keeps up the momentum for the most part, except when it stops almost completely for some guitar noises only to start back up again.\n\nNecrophiliac is the last classic song on this album and is perhaps Slayer\u2019s darkest song ever. The song opens off like all classics should: with a distinctive riff, this one with a definite Slayer feel to it. Then the main riff comes in which is more of a \u201cchord progression,\u201d manages to be extremely dark in it\u2019s own simplicity, much like the main riff to Black Sabbath\u2019s self titled song. This is changed up with just one tremolo riff to keep things simple and memorable. All the time, the drums are pounding along a simple pattern, but then suddenly deliver an impressive salvo. The lyrics are provocative one could probably imagine from the song title. The bridge offers a few more quality riffs, followed by one of the greatest Slayer moments ever:\n\n\u201cLucifer Takes My Dark Soul \n\nDown To The Fiery Pits Of Hell\nDown To The Fiery Pits Of\u2026..\n\nHEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!\u201d\n",
        "\nOwing to all the hubbub over the upcoming Slayer full-length, I recently got this one out, and gave it a spin for reassessment purposes.\n\nThis record is a brief , but totally enjoyable, slab of raucous FUN.\n\nIf you want massive thundering live hall / arena sound, and one of the 20th century's most visible bands at the peak of their powers, this is not the place to go...luckily for you, there is a certain 2-disc onslaught called Decade of Aggression to satisfy those needs. Now then, if you want to hear the sounds of people being driven into frenzies of mania by the kind of electrified black magic that only a young Slayer (complete with the castrato shrieks on 'The Antichrist'....my \"soul will RRRRROOOOOTTTT!\") could dish out, then this is well worth the half-hour or so that it will take out of your life.\n\nIt really isn't the 'music', per se, that makes this album; but the combination of music with the VERY audible fans. I was really disappointed when I finally found out that this was just a 'live studio' recording and not an actual club gig....when I first heard this record, all my friends and I were laughing our asses off at the prospect of an audience who could actually be LOUDER than Slayer. Whatever the case, there's something weirdly comforting about hearing a 50-strong crowd of dudes (and it's all 'dudes', no 'ladies and gentlemen' here, I'm afraid...) making a joyful noise unto the Slayer for the ENTIRE SET; whooping and hollering and shouting out song titles as if they hoped their focused, diabolical energy would cause the Pentagon to levitate or something. After a while it makes me wonder who is actually working harder here...the band, or their fans? Even if they have been drinking for about 6 hours before Slayer even plugged in, an hour of of matching the band's songs blow-for-blow with enthusiastic yelling must be hard work. \n\nThe songs are, again, not as majestic as the studio LP versions or the 'Decade of Aggression' versions (although 'Evil Has No Boundaries' isn't available on D.O.A.). In fact, they're not really that different in their execution, other than the fact that Tom Araya might occasionally growl where he would have shrieked otherwise, or vice versa. There's few surprises to be had in terms of drastically re-arranged solos or improvisations. No chances for Dave Lombardo to really cut loose on the drums, either. But none of that really matters. The 'fifth column' of crazy Slayer fans is a potent instrument that makes this record way more entertaining than your typical live record: cookie-cutter affairs which are normally tossed to the hungry masses as a 'stop-gap' between the production of studio albums.\n\nI'd recommend this not only to metal fans, but also to people who are \"on the outside looking in\" on metal culture: people writing their sociology reports on 'metal' (and there are just about a ton of 'em..believe me); or to those people who think it's somehow *cough* FUNNY and IRONIC to wear a 2nd-hand Slayer t-shirt to the nearest hipster bar. And while the latter people might enjoy this album for totally different reasons than a real metal fan would, it just goes to show what an effective formula Slayer have brewed up.\n",
        "\nThe only shitty part about getting this EP was going into the mallcore infested store Hot Topic. That will be the last time I will ever step foot into that store. There was an aggrivated employee in the back of the cashier while I purchased this EP. He thought I was stupid for buying it. I'm not, I have no regrets buying this EP at all.\n\nNow on to the music. Cult is a really great song. The sound production of the song is great. It starts off with something similar to what a modern hard rock band might do. The guitar doesn't sound that great in the beginning with the cymbal work going on. It gets better as Dave Lombardo's assault and batter begins and the guitar riff sounds better. The drums start to get better too. When Tom Araya delivers his awesome vocals, it sounds like good ol' thrash metal. The guitars and drums sound really thrashy at this point. The best thrash metal guitar duo execute with great speed. It is not Reign in Blood-like, however it is somewhat standard for Slayer. The first guitar solo also sounds somewhat standard for Slayer. It was just short and sweet guitar solo. It could of been a little bit longer. The guitar solo that ends the song doesn't really make up for it.\n\nThe lyrics sound a little bit childish, but it is straight forward. I get the message very clearly and I think 5 years olds can get it too. Kerry King could of wrote slightly better lyrics. C'mon, dude! The drums are the most superior aspect of the song. Lombardo returns to Slayer and he really rocks. He never disappoints me.\n\nThe videos on this EP are OK. They could of put more footage of the behind the scenes video with Slayer in the studio. I was thinking it would be the one I saw on the internet, but with more added. Nope, it's the video many Slayer fans downloaded. The only thing is, the quality is much superior. The video with Slayer performing War Ensemble is pretty good. As always the band was ultra energetic along with the crowd was really into it.\n\nI'm sure the newest Slayer will be pretty cool. After listening to Cult a few times, I think the album will be worthwhile. I will be buying the new album the day it comes out.\n",
        "\nWell lets start with the bad. The song still has annoying parts that King still can't shake from his Hardcore/Numetal lovefest days. That breakdown at 2:48 is absolute garbage. Luckily it only lasts 20 or so seconds. The lyrics are also a bit silly, and aren't very convincing. \n\nOn to the good. The intro is decent, an attempt at a Hell Awaits/Jesus Saves type intro where they start with 3-4 different mid paced riffs before breaking out into a full on thrash assault. Once the main riff comes in with Tom's vocals , it is 100 percent Slayer. 3 Quality riffs in a row, which is about 2 more quality riffs than the entire GHUA album. The rhythm guitar is kinda buried but it's not too bad, it should stand out alittle more though. The vocals are also a major improvement over GHUA. Sounds like Araya circa Seasons/Divine Intervention. \n\nAnyway, if this song didn't have that annoying breakdown, it would get into the 80s. When it thrashes, it's pretty damn good.\n",
        "\nThe first Slayer material in...5 years? Well, as probably any other reviewer before and after me, I expected total crap. I was pretty surprised actually, the production, as well as the riff and song structures actually have nothing in common with the quite awful \"God Hates Us All\". \"Cult\" sounds very much like a song that didn't make it on \"Divine Intervention\". \n\nThe riffs themselves are mainly thrash. About one half of them are somewhat toned down and mediocre, but the other half is actually pretty well crafted. Total \"Divine Intervention\". Two \"we are Slayer - whammy bar\" solos also found their way onto the song and they actually fit rather well. \n\nThe vocals are just a tad too loud, even though Araya doesn't even sound that bad. There is no stupid distortion or experimentation layered on his voice and his voice sounds pretty fit. Of course there are no \"Angel of Death\" - esque screams (fuck, what did you expect?) but he sounds very much like he did in the early 90s. \n\nThe drumming is very fine, but what did you expect of Lombardo? He did a fine job, as always. \n\nSo, Slayer delivers a rather fine piece of music, leaving all the shitty experimentation and most of the mallcoreness from their last albums behind. \n\nOf course you can't compare this single to recent Thrash releases from oldschool bands (Destruction, Kreator, Heathen...they all beat this one easily), but it might be worth a listen or two. \n\nIs it possible that we'll be getting a good Slayer album again?\n",
        "\nIt all depends on what you expected it to be. No, it's not \"faster than ever\", no it's not a return to Reign in Blood, but hey, at least it's not Diabolus in Musica or God Hates Us All.\n\nPersonally, I expected absolute shit. I think it was due to the fact that the EP is only being released to Hot Topic stores, or maybe it was due to the fact that Slayer has been touring with shitty mallcore bands like Shitknot, or maybe it was due to the downward spiral that Slayer have thrown themselves into by trying to appeal to mallgoths in the first place. But I digress, I think the reason why I don't hate this song like many others have is because it turned out better than I expected.\n\nSome parts of the song sound like Slayer, other parts just don't seem to convince me. The intro to the song seems like an attempt to sound creepy, I don't exactly know what it's supposed to be, all I know is that it sounds familiar to something off a Korn album. After this though a familiar Slayer type intro starts, it's simple and short however and doesn't progress into anything better, but rather, into something much worse. It progresses into a Korn-style \"breakdown\" (the main \"breakdown\" of this song apparently), rather than being a Thrash-style breakdown in which it gets faster or harder, it goes mallcore style in which it gets slower, simpler, and lower. Sounds a lot like Korn. But to be fair, at the start after this slow \"breakdown\" the Thrash part kicks in to start the verse. The best part about it are the drums (hell, the drums are really the best thing going on for this song), as for the riff itself, well, it sounds cool, even though its simple. Although after hearing the song for a while it might start to sound like something off Shitknot's third album. The chorus riff follows the same fate, although it's better than the verse riff. As for the solos, they're lazy, forgettable and random. In general though, the instruments arn't too bad, despite their simpleness. The problem is that after a while you get to notice a few small details that make them sound like a song written by a mallcore band. But even though it's simple, it's not as crappy and boring as their 2 previous albums, it's definitely more catchy too. It's not as good as anything before that though. But who knows, maybe they're saving the best for last. Maybe the album will turn out even better.\n\nBut anyways, on to the vocals and lyrics, the lyrics are pretty stupid, but at least not as retarded as the ones in God Hates Us All. The lyrics seem like they're written by a \"mature\" 17 year old liberal mall goth child ranting about how much he hates religion and how much religion is all about violence and rape and torture and blah blah blah. I think the funniest part was near the end when he says Jesus is holding a trigger to your head, or something like that. The other really funny thing about it is when he screams \"666!\" every now and then, it reminds me of those stupid people that send Varg Vikernes letters every day about how much they love and worship Satan. The vocals themselves don't sound too bad though, they just sound like the good old Araya vocals (without the high pitched screams), even though there are times when it sounds worn out. There are however, a few occassions where he tries to scream harder, but it just sounds annoying.\n\nIn the end, I guess one could say it seems as if the new album might sound most like Divine Intervention. The song is fun to listen to if you get past a few of its bad sides. It's an ok song I suppose. The main reason it gets a higher rating though is because its better than the 2 previous albums, other than the fact that the song itself is decent enough. Would I buy this single or the EP? No way. If you want to listen to Cult, just listen to it on http://www.slayer.net or download it somewhere. It's too early to say how the album will turn out, but download it first. Judging from this song, the album itself might be decent enough to buy, but at the same time, it might not be. Check out this song in the mean time. You might like it, you might hate it, you might think it's simply decent, but at least you'll satisfy your curiosity. One thing is for sure though, mallgoth kids are going to masturbate to this new album.\n",
        "\nJudging from the first few listens, this would probably be hailed as the best Slayer album ever recorded. Every song from start to finish, save one (\u201cTemptation\u201d), leaves a mark that makes you want to listen to it again. Never has a Slayer album been this infectious and catchy! Even mad thrashing songs like \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d and \u201cBorn of Fire\u201d emanate a singy-songy vibe that everybody will remember for a period of time (an ominous sign for a review).\n\nCarrying with what South of Heaven left us, the songs are strategically paced, meaning there are no songs that rekindle the breakneck, frantic, frenetic frenzy of Reign In Blood (although \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d comes damn close). In addition, the songs are more commercially viable, so it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that MTV included the melodic and epic title track in the regular playlist of Headbanger\u2019s Ball.\n\nIt then becomes evident that Slayer has matured greatly from their speed metal heydays, evident from their subdued songs and the prominence of mood and atmosphere (\u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d, the title track), and tuneful solos (!), all of which are a result of improved songwriting.\n\nHowever, this thing ain\u2019t a Merlot, folks, because at the same time, this is the easiest Slayer album to digest, which is in fact a bad thing. The songs, except again \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d, don\u2019t really age well. Part of the problem is the simplified, straightforward attack they supplied the album. Any amazing album challenges the listeners in determining the nuances and the skill of the music before they are able to unfold the greatness of the album. With this, however, almost all of the songs are upfront and naked, as they suffer from the same thrash-chugging riff template. \u201cBlood Red\u201d and \u201cSkeletons of Society\u201d are some of the songs which are nicely composed, memorable, and musically convincing, but after playing it back again and again, given their problems, they sound exhausted and eventually loses their power.\n\nGranted that this album falls a little bit short from its conceived reputation, it still is a worthy listen. It\u2019s just a bit overrated for its own good.\n",
        "\nSLAYER \u2013 GOD HATES US ALL 25%\n\nLame lame lame! This album is a frustrating listen. The nayslayers who believed the band is washed up are actually true! The production is a lot crispier and crunchier compared to the polished, Rick Rubin style. However, Tom Araya\u2019s voice becomes more annoying, not that they were good even before he started singing them. Gone are the blood-curdling screams that gives metal boys a boner every time they hear them (\u201cAngel of Death\u201d, \u201cNecrophobic\u201d, \u201cAggressor Perfector\u201d). Although I appreciate that Mr. Araya attempts the high-pitched scream, particularly on \u201cGod Send Death\u201d, it just doesn\u2019t feel right anyway. And \u201cSeven Faces\u201d. Especially \u201cSeven Faces\u201d. His ear-raping introductory scream sounds like he just lost the winner lotto ticket. Just horrible.\nMusic-wise, I\u2019ll start with the positive. \u201cDiscipline\u201d is a decent thrash attack track that gets the album off well enough to get others to listen the next track, \u201cGod Send Death\u201d, which is also good in a way. Both track also reintroduces the frenetic soloing sorely lacking on the previous release. \u201cNew Faith\u201d is fine, although straightforward track, which contains the cheesy line, \u2018I keep the Bible in a pool of blood so that none of its lies can affect me\u2019. I just don\u2019t know why people go apeshit with that line.\nNow, on with the bad, which is pretty much everything else. It seems that the songs are made in an attempt to make Slayer relevant in the current times, where bands like Slipknot, Mudvayne, and other groove-laden rock outfit tailor their music into prepackaged, commercially angst-ridden music. But just like \u2018Diabolus In Musica\u2019, \u2018God Hates Us All\u2019 gained little fans from that target market, but lost a lot a followers from the metal scene. This is simply not the Slayer that everybody loved. Everybody blames Kerry King for writing crappy song, but I feel everybody in the band should take the brunt as well for having released the song at their consent. Not that they are expected to release the same material from the past, but at least they could have made it better! \u2018Threshold\u2019 just sounds disinterested in coming up with more than three riffs for the whole song. \u2018Bloodline\u2019 is bored out of its skull, and the sinister effect of the song just doesn\u2019t cut it. \u2018Exile\u2019 is actually Pantera-Shattered, although mildly interesting, is just as disjointed, along with \u2018Cast Down\u2019.\nEverybody still respects Slayer, to an extent, especially with what they have accomplished in the past. But they\u2019re turning out to be the next Metallica. A lot of hopefuls still believe they can return to past glory, but hoping just deepens the wounds, because it looks like they\u2019re not going in that direction. Ultimately disappointing.\n",
        "\nFour years since Slayer\u2019s last album (not counting Undisputed Attitude, of course), and we get this mediocre piece of pseudo-groove-thrash. Not the worst album in the world by any stretch, despite popular belief, but it\u2019s a damn shame to what happened to this once evil and amazing metal band. Most of the songs are tired, groovey, and unSlayer-like; the band has obviously been affected by the nu metal/mallcore climate during its time. Listen to the verse riff of \u2018Stain of Mind, which squanders the promising intro and mutates the song into this lameass three-chord riff. Stinkers such as \u2018Death\u2019s Head\u2019, \u2018Perversion of Pain\u2019, \u2018In The Name of God, \u2018Love to Hate\u2019 unabashedly use nu metal elements to fuller effect. I am not sure if Slayer were consciously aiming at radio airplay, which actually became the case for \u2018Stain of Mind\u2019, but that doesn\u2019t give them an excuse to compose and write trite material like this. Another weak aspect of the album is Tom Araya\u2019s monotonous and grating vocal performance. If you think the vocals on Divine Intervention were irritating, wait till you hear the lame hardcore barking of \u2018Love to Hate\u2019, and you will really love to hate this song.\nNevertheless, there are diamonds in this rough album. \u2018Bitter Peace\u2019 is a nice attempt to return to their thrashtastic glory. Although it does sound like Machine Head, i.e. modern thrash, it still does not compromise the intensity of the song. \u2018Overt Enemy\u2019 is a different beast, a lurking, heavy song, which is unfortunately ruined by Araya\u2019s newly-found hardcore posing. \u2018Undisputed Attitude\u2019 is just badass. From the double-bass intro, to the sinister sounding chorus, this song harkens back to the glory days, albeit to a slower effect. \u2018Point\u2019 is the pinnacle of the album, arguably the best underrated Slayer song ever, with great lyrics, nice variety of pace creating mood and distance, and great dynamics.\nPersonally, this album opened the gates into the world of metal for me, so I might be subjected into giving this album a greater grade than it deserves. Still, despite its glaring shortcomings and lame moments, there are good songs that keep the album worthwhile to listen to. Proceed with caution.\n",
        "\nOK, so maybe this album has a nostalgic value for me, being my initiation to the violent world of the (once) mighty Slayer. But even when all sentimental feelings are put aside, this is still objectively their finest release ever. I know all the albums from their classic period \u2013 you know, the one beginning with \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d and ending with \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d (yes, despite of what some people would make you believe, there was another worthwhile effort after \u201cSeasons\u201d) \u2013, but none of them are quite as good as this one.\n\nNo, not even the much-revered \u201cReign in Blood.\u201d It might be overall faster and more brutal than \u201cSeasons,\u201d but let\u2019s be realistic here: \u201cReign\u201d clocks in at under half an hour! I mean, if \u201cReign\u201d were like fifteen minutes longer, wouldn\u2019t it be rather boring? I like that album as much as anybody, but one major reason why it\u2019s so good is that it\u2019s over before it can get too repetitive, because there certainly isn\u2019t much there in terms of variation. Sure, \u201cReign\u201d is an undisputable classic, but what if Slayer had gone on to record a couple more thirty-minute-long albums in that vein? Wouldn\u2019t everyone have accused them of copying themselves and being lazy songwriters? And besides, people who won\u2019t acknowledge that \u201cSeasons\u201d has plenty of high-speed thrash assaults on its own should seriously have their ears checked \u2013 yeah sure, \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d (including that infamous \u201cWaaaaaaaaar!!!\u201d shout by Tom Araya), \u201cSpirit in Black,\u201d \u201cHallowed Point,\u201d and \u201cBorn of Fire\u201d are all pretty lame, aren\u2019t they\u2026\n\nI really think Slayer made the right decision in writing songs for \u201cSeasons\u201d that hearken back to the speed and brutality of \u201cReign\u201d while retaining some of the better elements of \u201cSouth of Heaven.\u201d Because that\u2019s exactly what \u201cSeasons\u201d is: a well-balanced blend between the musical directions of its two predecessors. However, thanks to the rediscovered aggression in Tom Araya\u2019s vocals, it never has that slightly whiny undertone by which \u201cSouth\u201d was marred at times\u2026\n\nMoreover, the alleged lack of riffs on \u201cSeasons\u201d has never occurred to me. It may not exactly be up there with \u201cDarkness Descends,\u201d but believe me, it has all the riffs it needs to make each song effective. After all, while it sure is good to have a great variety of riffs, there\u2019s absolutely no point in artificially stuffing songs chock-full of riffs just for the sake of demonstrating how good you are at playing your guitar. That may have worked on \u201cDarkness Descends,\u201d but it didn\u2019t work all that well on \u201cTime Does Not Heal\u201d\u2026 I mean, some people apparently sit in front of their stereo with pen and notepad, meticulously counting every single riff, and god forbid there aren\u2019t at least 200 different riffs played \u2013 that album MUST suck by definition\u2026\n\nWell, back to \u201cSeasons\u201d\u2026 Apart from the fast songs already mentioned, there are also a couple of rather slow, plodding ones, and they also work really well. \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d is very reminiscent of \u201cSouth of Heaven,\u201d and not one bit as gay as some people claim. On the contrary, with its smooth guitar leads it does a great job at evoking a sinister, menacing atmosphere, though I must say I could have done without that annoying kid screaming at the end\u2026 \u201cExpendable Youth,\u201d with its memorable chorus and overall \u201cstreet gang feel,\u201d is also pretty enjoyable, as are \u201cSkeletons of Society\u201d and the underrated \u201cTemptation.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, though, the best song on \u201cSeasons\u201d is of course the monumental title track, containing some of the best riffs Hanneman and King have ever penned down. Just thinking about the one that comes right before the main riff \u2013 you know, the one Beavis and Butthead used to headbang to \u2013 almost makes me drool all over my keyboard (ARRRGH, I think I just electrocuted myself). This song can best be described as epic Thrash, and needless to say, it rules for the entire length of more than six minutes.\n\nAn album like \u201cSeasons\u201d really makes me wish Slayer could still write songs like this. As we all know, the band took a turn for the worse (well, MUCH worse) with the Mall-influenced abomination that was \u201cDiabolus in Musica.\u201d Although \u201cGod Hates Us All\u201d marked a slight improvement, at least containing a handful of decent songs, it seems very doubtful the guys can return to the glory of old with their next record \u2013 if it ever gets released, that is. I mean, are Slayer lazy songwriters or what?! Even dinosaurs like Iron Maiden manage to put out a new record every three years or so\u2026\n\nChoicest cuts: Seasons in the Abyss, War Ensemble, Spirit in Black, Dead Skin Mask, Expendable Youth, Born of Fire\n",
        "\nThis album isn't exactly \"heavy,\" nor is it \"lightning fast,\" like one would have expected. It's unusual for Slayer, but also equally unusual for me to be reviewing this album. However, I am a strong supporter of this album for anyone who enjoys metal. A track-by-track review would be helpful here, so that you could pick out the song to begin with, but I simply don't believe that would do the album justice. This album is best viewed as an anthem - not just a collection of songs. Different melodies, different beats, but a common artistic motif.\n\nFor starters, the drums run at a moderate pace, and are somewhere in the production. You can hear them clearly, but at the same time they're not in the foreground, nor in the background. They carry the album along smoothly, and there's a clever usage of the toms here, played in succession for fills that are appropriately and precisely placed, giving the illusion of speed. The cymbals aren't excessive, and are saved for effect. The drums aren't constantly fills, thankfully. It's easy to follow, and often mimics the voice of the guitars, giving proper emphasis where appropriate.\n\nThe guitars speak for themselves, playing memorable melodies, such as the opener to the title track \"South of Heaven,\" which is unforgettable. These melodies are never heavy, and are never exaggerated. They're well played, expressing emotions properly, and, as is expected in metal, are the focal point of the songs. The bass is picked out by some, but I never find myself especially interested by it, nor able to find it in any songs. I probably wouldn't know if bands had bassists unless people told me, in most cases. Some might find the bass lines to be nice, though. I'm not one of them, however.\n\nThe vocals are discernable, unlike in most metal. I find it appropriate here, as heaviness is in no way emphasized. They don't sound too angry, yet express hatred accurately, as I would imagine was the goal here. The vocals aren't quite monotone, but border on it, so it's similar to the bass's purpose after looking through the tabs - follow the guitars.\n\nAll in all, this album is definitely worth checking out.\n",
        "\nSlayer is aggression, but the problem is everytime they change they're trying to improve their music, the fans get pissed off. People were pissed off with South of Heaven (now considered as a masterpiece), now people are pissed off with god hates us all.\n\nThis is certainly not the best slayer album, but it is aggressive, thrashy (thrash-core), good lyrics, slayer solo's and off course hate and blasphemy. The reason why it sounds more hardcore is because of Araya's voice. The man is getting older, and when he tries to scream Halford-alike like on Angel of death intro-scream, he sounds like a chicken getting fucked in the ass. It's for the best he changed his voice, or it would have been emberassing. \n\nDisciple is a tremendous song, a bid hardcore, lots of thrash and totally slayer. \n\n'Homocide, suicide,\nhate heals you should try it sometime\nstrive for peace with acts of war\nthe beauty of death we all adore\ni have no faith, distracting me,\ni know why your prayers will never be answered\ngod hates us all'\n\nand\n\n'Wake the fuck up cant ignore what i say\ni got my own philosphy\ni hate everyone equally\nyou cant tear that out of me\nno segregation, seperation\njust me in my world of enemies'\n\nare excellent lyrics.\n\nGod Send Death and New Faith are good songs, with good solos. Threshold has brilliant parts and has slipknot parts, but exile is the worst slayer song ever. It just sounds too slipknot.\n\nThen the sound changes again: seven faces sounds very good, with an agressive doom-riff (remembers me of gates of slumber). Bloodline is a typical song on this album, then the next 3 songs are pure agression and hate, Deviance, war zone and Here comes the pain. These are very good songs, especially here comes the pain, which represents the new slayer (thrashcore)sound the best. The last song, payback, tries to be old school slayer, but it is just a bad copy from Angel of Death.\n\nI hope the next slayer album will be more thrashy, sounding like reign in blood or seasons in the abyss, but this is an owkay album! Remove Exile and Payback and it is even excellent!\n",
        "\nTo begin, let's have a summarised look at what this album is in it's simplest form. This album is in my opinion... the best work Slayer has ever put out. Slayer are.. in many metalhead's opinions.. one of the best and most influental bands in the Thrash genre. Thrash was the first form of extreme metal.. it's STILL one of the best genres in existence (2nd only to what it spawned.. death metal) and DEFINATELY the most original / elbow-grease-requiring genre in the history of metal, the first to bring out true aggression and anger (not teen angst, but true, ass kicking rage).\n\nSlayer are mostly known for their landmark release Reign In Blood, although the actual music in Reign In Blood was fantastic and inspiring for it's time.. it was still a flawed album, with the average song clocking in somewhere around 2 minutes 30 seconds. The album was produced far too quietly, it was very hard to tell the difference between most of the songs, and only those with acute metal ears could truly embrace the feeling and know a riff well enough to get it stuck in their head. \n\nSouth Of Heaven has all the goods and none of the bads of an incredible album, Reign In Blood. Yes folks.. this album is fucking killer.\n\nFirst off.. the bass on this album is far more audible. It really adds to the tone of album and gives it a fatter / meaner sound. The drums are produced better.. the bass drum in particular has more 'oomph' (which is what the bass drum is all about) so that's an obvious plus right there, the solos are more audible, the riffs are more audible, the vocals are less audible, production-wise we have a musically perfect balance for the band in question.\n\nMusically.. this album just kicks ass. The introductions to songs like 'Mandatory Suicide' and 'South Of Heaven' are just downright fucking evil and creepy.. and very memorable as well (I've almost always got the introduction to Mandatory Suicide in my head). The music is very well written.. the riffs are brilliant and thrashy.. the tempo isn't so fast it ruins the song, the songs are very memorable.. this is one of the best albums in metal history!\n\nIf you don't have this.. then you must get your filthy metal hands on it ASAP, but please undertake a thorough ass-preparation ceremony before daring to place this little piece of hell in your CD player.\n",
        "\nI saw so many reviews praising this release I just had to chip in and offer a dissenting opinion. And dissenting it is in that I find it the beginning of Slayer's weakening as a force to be reckoned with in metal.\n\nFirstly, the production, while better than the tin can ambience of \"South of Heaven\" is not that good; the guitar sound is still a bit weaker and thinner than \"RIB\", the bass is as always nonexistent, and the drums still sound like Dave's beating on tin cans. Far from the first ingredient in a recipe for good metal, ya'll. \n\nAnd secondly, the soloing isn't quite as insanely inspired as their earlier material, either, especially when King & Hannemann actually try and play more melodically. That comes off as forced and uninspired compared to their trademark whammy bar madness. The riffing is better on the thrashers, too, it flows more naturally and doesn't feel as dull as the riffs for the slower songs, which just kind of plod along. In fact, it sounds to me like they simply recycled the same main riff and feel for several of those slower songs--boooring. \n\nThen there's Araya's vocals, which continue in the same semi-melodic vein as last album. Unfortunately he sounds whiny and weak about half the time--the slower songs, surprise, surprise. \n\nIn fact, only about half this album is worth listening to, and that would be the barnburners that show Slayer still had it on this album. Well, OK, \"Blood Red\" is pretty good--the opening riff is nice and dissonant and the riff right before the verse is pretty sweet too, slightly Sabbathy in its feel. And the title track is not half bad, especially that menacing intro and that galvanizing verse riff. Even the chorus, with its multitracked vocals, is more effective than elsewhere. But \"Expendable Youth\" especially...ick. Booooring!\n\nReally, Slayer should've stuck with what they did best, the blazing thrash numbers with occasional dips into slower parts for dynamics and breathing room instead of making half an album and the rest of it forgettable shite. But how can I not love \"Hallowed Point\", the last half of \"Spirit in Black\" (the first half sounds entirely too cliched and awkward to my ear to really be effective), and of course \"War Ensemble\"--WAAAAAAARRRRRRR!!!!!! \"Dead Skin Mask\" has a pretty creepy atmosphere, especially at the end when the gremlin voice starts yelling and screaming under Araya's droning chorus vocal part--too bad the riffs are mostly not up to maintaining that atmosphere. \n\nNot one of Slayer's better albums, this was, and most everything that followed got worse and worse. Download the faster songs if you must, and check out the slower songs at your own risk so as to avoid intense boredom.\n",
        "\nYes it\u2019s a surprisingly high rating for a Slayer album after Seasons in the Abyss but, as I find myself reaching for this album much more often than that or Reign in Blood, I realize it\u2019s definitely worth it. After a four year absence and a new drummer (gasp) they came back with this and I was completely fucking blown away. The production is very nice and clean but with that it takes away a tad bit of aggression. But all fears of that are gone because it\u2019s full of great riffs and some fucking fast great songs. I think many people that bash Bostaph are a little biased to the \u201cclassic Slayer.\u201d He\u2019s just as good as Lombardo was and shows some very incredible and technical double-bass work. He\u2019s also a bit more fill happy than Dave was which isn\u2019t a bad thing. There isn\u2019t one horrible song and if a song starts to suck it\u2019s replenished with riffs again.\n\nAnd if you doubt Bostaph\u2019s power behind the kit just listen to the first few seconds of the album. The small drum solo leads into a very different type opener for Slayer. Different as in, notice all the odd time signatures about 1 minute into it. It remains extremely kickass and transitions into a classic Slayer speedy section which is equally good. Holy damn, a short but memorable solo right there and chaos ensues until it abruptly ends. That was just 4 minutes? No time to breath as it\u2019s quickly followed by a much faster Sex. Murder. Art.\u201d Starts out with very fast double bass from Bostaph. Hmm, people seem to orgasm at the Angel of Death solo, yet who notices these moments? Some nice violent lyrics. \u201cBeaten into submission, raping again and again.\u201d With it being only 1:50 in length it\u2019s similar to something found on Reign in Blood. Fictional Reality, with its catchy riffs, slows things down a bit with the verse. It also has the slow interesting breakdown section thrown in the middle with some strange guitar effects. Jesus christ Dittohead is not only the best song on the album but one of the best Slayer songs ever. Right up there with Necrophobic for speed, this is an incredibly fast aggressive piece of thrash. Tom Araya spits out words as fast as Kerry and Jeff shred and it\u2019s all kept up by Paul\u2019s drumming. It slows down slightly for a crushing breakdown and solo. After a weird little section it goes back into the speed and ends very nicely. By this point, Tom\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t that apparent but in the title track his vocals take a little spill. Besides that the song which is the longest on the album is a little weird in parts. Probably the only one I tend to skip sometimes. Three minutes into it gets very nice though.\n\nCircle of Beliefs is the next track and is my second favorite. The opening riff just commands you to headbang. Tom\u2019s voice seems a bit distorted in certain sections but isn\u2019t really noticeable. It picks up the pace and gets really fucking nice. Good chorus, good leads, and riffs and riffs. They kick your ass with that opening riff again at 3:00.\nSS-3 (anyone know what that name means?) starts out interesting and then goes into a kind of boring midtempo verse. Seems like its going to be a pretty dull song, but wait godlike riffing comes in at the 2 minute mark. Serenity in Murder has another oddly timed opening but turns crappy and midtempo with distorted vocals. But its saved again by some fast riffs later in the song. I believe they also made a video for this song. 213 starts out interesting with acoustics. It turns into sort of a Dead Skin Mask part 2. It actually isn\u2019t a bad song at all but has some awkward (\u201cMy skin crawls with orgasmic seed\u2026\u2026I need a friend...\u201d) lyrics. Mind Control is how to end an album. Fast and aggressive with plenty of riffs to go around. It has another nice solo as well. In fact this album may have the better of Slayer\u2019s solos on it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make perfection so you can\u2019t really ask for it. But this could have been pretty damn close. It\u2019s kind of odd that the \u201cclassic\u201d three Slayer albums, in my opinion, fall under both the early years and this one. Well it only gets crappier and crappier after this taking everything in more of a groove movement. This was a masterpiece for \u201994 so at least respect Slayer for waiting a little longer to suck than the other big thrash bands.\n",
        "\nThis short EP followup to Slayer's debut album shows the band compromising nothing. They left most of the melody behind, as well as dumping the in key solos, in favor for a faster, more brutal approach. The solos are wilder, the vocals feature more shouting, the riffs and drumming are faster and the production is much rawer. \n\nChemical Warfare opens up with some of the fastest Slayer material written. Though Reign in Blood was faster, there wasn't a single song on the album that was this epic. This song easily could have fit on Hell Awaits. Captor of Sin has some very mosh worthy riffs, while Haunting the Chapel boasts one absoloutley insane guitar solo. This type of solo would become a typical Slayer moment, of which many countless bands would copy and use as their own. My copy came with the bonus track Aggressive Perfector, which was off Metal Massacre 3. I'm guessing Metal Blade thought it would be cool to tack this song at the end as a bonus track to show where Slayer came from. If I didnt know better, I would have guessed it was a Venom song, though not nearly as sloppy or poorly produced. \n\nAfter this, Slayer would continue to increase the quality of their albums with perfect release after perfect release, until the short downfall on Divine Intervention and the plummet to mediocre music after that. But for its time, this was probably the heaviest, fastest slab of vinyl on the planet. Their only competition were death metal kings Possessed, and later on, Kreator and Death. \n\nIn short, this is an essential Slayer nugget that belongs in any fan's collection.\n",
        "\nAfter the colossal mindfuck that was \"Reign In Blood\", Slayer shocked us by declaring that they were--gasp!--SLOWING IT DOWN for the next album! Say it ain't so! But they did, and the Gods of Heavy Metal looked and they saw that it was Good. No, in fact, they saw it was GREAT. \n\nBut all is not well with this album. For one thing, Rick Rubin still needs to be hung by his back hair and beaten with a baseball bat for the beyond weak and tinny \"production\". \"Yer kidding me, right? This sounds like shit!\" was my initial reaction to this when I plopped it down on my turntable back in 1989 after months of excited waiting. The guitar tone is the worst they've ever had, second only to \"God Hates Us All\", thin and powerless--may as well be no distortion at all on them at all. The drums sound like milk cartons, for fuck's sake! The bass was never a major part of Slayer's sound, but even on \"Hell Awaits\" you could hear it better then here--it may as well just say \"Araya: Vocals and Maybe Bass\" on the sleeve. I digress. \n\nThe tunes are what matter here, and Slayer served them up with a heaping portion of that inimitable \"Fuck you, DIE!\" attitude they used to have back in the day. The title track opens the proceeedings with a mournful and dissonant dual-guitar harmony that is beautifully twisted and when the riffs come crashing in for the buildup to \"Before you see the light, you must DIE!!\", giving way to a propulsive verse riff that drives the song along relentlessly and some of the best lyrics from Araya's poison pen. \n\nThe ending wail of chilling feedback segues right into \"Silent Scream\" (if you listen closely you can hear where the loop overlaps!), a skull-battering thrashfest featuring Dave's lightning-fast by any era's standards double bass work. Problem is, the production is so weak it renders the opening single note riff salvo powerless due to the lack of bottom end. That is the only thing not worthy about this track. \n\nAnother issue I had with this album is Araya getting it into his head that he could sing, with mixed results--when he tries to be purely melodic he suffers from lack of conviction (see the otherwise-decent \"Behind The Crooked Cross\", which *does* have a good chorus), but when he gets more bollocks into it he sounds better. It doesn't hurt that he lets out one of his trademark \"lost soul in hell\" shrieks in \"Live Undead\" too. \n\nOther tunes I really like on this platter are: \"Mandatory Suicide\" with its repetitive riffs on the chorus (eerie spoken word part at the end too), \"Ghosts of War\" with its connection to \"Chemical Warfare\" in the intro, and \"Spill The Blood\" with its haunting (and unheard-of at the time) clean guitar intro and swift riffing over midtempo drumming. \n\nOverall, this for me was the last really good Slayer album, as after this they began slowly and painfully slipping into the abyss of mediocrity. Everything they released after this LP was just not the same.\n",
        "\nThis must be what fans have been waiting for and undoubtedly rekindles the fires of their past live offerings. The main attraction of this DVD is yet another bold and terrifyingly energetic performance from the band, which is just what fans would expect. Inlcuded also is a rather hilarious 50 minute documentary, full of stupid fans doing stupid stuff, a video for the God Hates Us All cut \"Bloodline\" and a rather small photo gallery. \n\nThis performance lives up to Slayer's reputation and follows on in the tradition of the live masterpiece of \"Decade of Aggression\". They manage to get through a good set of generally regarded \"classics\" and some of the better songs from \"God Hates Us All\". Though I would love more than just the title track to be played from the Hell Awaits album, which makes Slayer's live releases an eternally frustrating experience in addition to one of reverence. They are still on top form here, with hiccups and improvisation here and there never hurting the material.\nThey stamp their authority all over the Warfiled and both band and crowd are frantically feeding off each other's energy. Inclusion of some questionable material, of which Diabolus In Musica's lackluster \"Stain of Crap\" is firmly accused of being doesn't bring down the set much, but like most live offerings all falls under the banner of opinion. There is never a setlist that can truly satisfy everybody, and while this one is very good with some favourites making an appearance (Postmortem, Chemical Warfare etc etc etc) leaves off several other crucial numbers. At least in my opinion.\n\nAfter the blazing live performance, Slayer's DVD still has one surprise left in the form of a documentary. Basically this is a collection of some of the stupidest and craziest fans ever seen, some interviews with a bunch of aging gits (also known as \"the band\") and many laughs along the way. I give credit to this for the sheer absurdity of some of the folk presented here: fantatical fans willing to self mutilate on Tom Araya's command, a girl pondering which band member would be a better fuck, one man who's inner demon bears the name Jim Carrey and another girl who would kill herself if one of the band members would want to have sex with her corpse. Madness, utter madness (also including guests in the form of Scott Ian and rather randomly, Kirk Hammet) and well worth seeing for the comedy value, I watch the DVD more for this than the live show. Rounding off this release, the \"Bloodline\" video is well directed and produced but is built upon one of the more annoying tracks on GHUA. Stick a proper solo in there and it might have been okey, but no... I digress. \n\nFans of the band will like this DVD which stays true to Slayer's uncompromising and brutal live show. Those who want a laugh will apply for the documentary too. Not the perfect DVD release but one that will definitely please Slayer fans' cravings for more.\n",
        "\nWell, I just got done watching this DVD for the second time, and I am more impressed with this one than \"War at the Warfield.\" First off, the sound quality is EXTREMELY better than Warfield. I think that the band, knowing this would not only document their classic, \"REIGN IN BLOOD,\" but also kind of a homecoming for Dave, they wanted it to sound better. Second, it's filmed way better, also. At first, I found myself getting dizzy as the camera angles move around A HELL OF A LOT and switch between black & white/color. But after getting used to this, I settled in for what will be a monument to when I saw them on last year's Jaeger tour, and the first time I had ever heard REIGN IN BLOOD played in its' entirety. Sure did bring back a lot of memories from my youth hearing the old stand-bys like \"Angel of Death\" and \"Altar of Sacrifice/Jesus Saves!!!\" Having Dave back in the fold seems to have injected the band with new life, as they tear through each song as if it was still the REIGN IN PAIN TOUR '86!!! The blood effect at the end of \"Post Mortem\" is INCREDIBLE.......needs to be seen to be believed!!! I know there are some who'll say that's it's hackneyed and stupid, but ...WHO CARES?!?!? It's Slayer, it's their music, and especially, their damn DVD!!!! I like their reaction backstage afterwards. It's almost as if they don't believe how amazing it was until it was all said and done! The idea of putting the other songs on as \"bonus tracks\" is a little bewildering to me, but again, I'm not complaining.......it's SLAYER! This is the first time I have seen \"Spill the Blood\" played live, and the rest are classic SLAYER live tracks. The interview segment entitled \"Slayer in Their Own Words\" is awesome, too, as it briefly goes back into Slayer's history and talks with each band member about what they brought/bring to the table as far as the band is concerned. Then a little about how the blood effect was created, and where they can see themselves going in the not-to-distant future. The best part is when Kerry & Jeff are asked what they would say to God if they died and went to heaven!!! Hilarious! Overall, I think they should've put a better interview segemnt on Warfield (like the one here), and maybe show the concert in the correct order, like on the Jaeger tour, and let the build-up add to energy and explosiveness that is the REIGN IN BLOOD album played live by the best live band in my estimation, ............SLAYER!!!!! Excellent work, guys. I don't know how much longer this band plans to go on, but I'll be there for the ride as long as it's as intense as their music has been for me over the years!!! Long Live Metal!!!\n",
        "\nIm not a huge fan of slayer or anything, I don't even listen to that many punk bands, but this one delivered more than my expectations. Just imagine slayers unrelenting speed/thrash style and punks raw aggression in one record.\nThe guitar sounds punk. The drums sound punk and fucking clear, the bass is heard well.And fuck, even Tom Araya sounds punk! Everything sounds good and thats enough for me.In short \"undisputed attitude \"pwns\" punk.\nMost songs are medleys of 2 songs from various punk bands and are roughly between 1 and 2 minutes long and they are fast, each number sleamlessly blending into the next song on the medley.\nThe album sounds fucking angry and hilarious at the same time. Youd wanna get drunk and shout along with the songs! Tom Araya screams his head off in this one spewing all the pissed off, hate filled lyrics to fast thrashy riffs and furious punk style drumming making this an all out punk massacre!!\nMost of the song is all made up from the essential elements of riff, chorus, abusive shouts and fast paced drums, with a few solos.\nEvery song is special in its own way. From songs like \"abolish government\" and \"Disintegration\" which are blistering fast to songs like \"Mr Freeze\" and \"DDAMM\" that are more mid tempo to songs like \"Spiritual law\" and \"Violent pacification\" ,slayers style flows through evenly adding the element of heaviness and speed into punk, making it enjoyable for a wider audience-both metalheads and punks.\nFor all you old school slayer fans, there is one track one this cd called \"Gemini\",It's a slayer original, and I gotta say that is one of their best songs. Its very atmospheric with slow singing, throbbing bass and sluggish riffs. This is the slayer we all know and it's a \nNice way to end the punk part of the album.\nThis album is not a showcase of slayers technical style or how \"evil\" they can sound. People hardly quote this one, slayers only cover album. But then again, this is more of a fun album, that's a light hearted attempt at crossing genres to come out with something that can still bring across the heaviness of slayer and the intensity that Punk has the potential to offer.\n",
        "\nWhat can you say about Slayer? They are one of the most aggressive and long-lasting metal bands in the genre. They challenged people with their speed, and in 1988's South of Heaven, they challenged their fans with the amount of melody included in that album. Their 1990 release Seasons in the Abyss is probably their most well-rounded release ever. It takes everything from their previous decade of work and puts it into one album. It has the uncompromising aggression of Reign in Blood yet still keeps the melody on South of Heaven. \n\nThis album once again proves Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King to be a guitar-playing force to be reckoned with. The album kicks off with the musical blitzkrieg \u201cWar Ensemble\u201d and beats you down from start to finish. Kerry\u2019s solo with the low E finger tapping was very cool, and is a great idea that I haven\u2019t heard from anyone else. Jeff Hanneman plays squealing, frightening, solos on songs like the incredibly fast and brutal \u201cHallowed Point\u201d. \u201cDead Skin Mask\u201d is an ode to everyone\u2019s favorite hick/serial killer, Ed Gein and is probably the most eerie Slayer song ever. The riff, the spoken word introduction by singer Tom Araya, and the weird samples of a child screaming at the end put chills up your spine. The album ends with the epic title track, and it is quite atmospheric with the brooding riffs and lyrics. It is one of the best songs on the album.\n\nSlayer\u2019s Seasons in the Abyss was a great way to start the 90s and is one of the band\u2019s best efforts. This is probably their most accessible and one of their most focused albums to date.\n",
        "\nNormally I don't buy DVD's because they typically suck, especially live ones. Seeing as this was slayer though I was hoping for an extreme show buy them, instead I got a pile of shit for a DVD. First of all the video quality was horrible. Maybe it was my DVD player but the lighting really fucks up the quality of the DVD and made it a pain to watch.\n\nThe setlist for the DVD was also not that great apart from having a few better songs from Reign in Blood and the fact they remembered classics, but I think we could do without some useless tracks on the DVD. I felt myself skipping through a lot of songs on it because they're either shitty songs and my eyes started to hurt from all the color, watching it was like asking for a seizure. Overall the setlist could have been much better.\n\nOne benifit is that slayer did play some classics, including Die by the Sword from Show No Mercy, Angel of Death, War Ensamble, South of Heaven, and others, but that doesn't really get it off as a good DVD. It was still a complete pile of steaming cowshit. I was not impressed with this dvd in any way shape or form.\n\nOh and what about the action? I thought Slayer ruled live. When I saw them live, and when I saw this DVD both shows sucked. Nothing really happens that's interesting. It's just like every other band playing live. What makes live slayer any better? Especially when their lights try to give you a seizure.\n\nI would avoid this DVD. While it may be slayer live on DVD it's still shit. I can't believe I made an idiot of myself to be so gullible to spend $20 on a live slayer DVD. I warn everyone to stay away. Maybe the new DVD is better, but I wouldn't hold my breath.\n",
        "\nHaunting The Chapel is very good for an EP and an introduction to heavier thrash metal but it's a weak follow-up to Show No Mercy, which is a speed/thrash classic in my opinion. Anyway, let's get to the music and the band's performace:\n\nTom Araya: His bass playing can be heard better here but his voice is not as good as previous Slayer songs. His screams are less, and he sings even faster.\nJeff Hanneman and Kerry King: The guitar team focuses on playing heavier on this album and playing wilder solos which turn out to be very weak compared to the leads on Show No Mercy. But anyway, their rhythm playing is still very tight and precise.\nDave Lombardo: The drummer's performance is still very strong. Here, he throws more fills and his drumming is more varied.\n\nI have a few comments about the songs:\n\nChemical Warfare: is a straight-forward thrasher which has tons of riffs and a catchy chorus. King's solo is very weak on this track and the song gets a little boring after a while.\n\nCaptor Of Sin: the highlight of the album. It might not be as heavy as Chemical Warfare, but it has the exciting speed metal influence similar to some songs on Show No Mercy.\n\nHaunting The Chapel: starts off with a crushing riff, but the song gets very repetitive. The lyrics here are kind of un-inspired too.\n\nAggressive Perfector: the other highlight of the album! Seriously, this song is perfect in everyway: it's fast, heavy, and the leads are much more creative. Even Tom Araya's singing is perfect.\n\nBottom Line: Captor Of Sin, and Aggressive Perfector are two of Slayer's best songs which must be heard and Chemical Warfare is a popular Slayer classic. So, I recommend getting this EP.\n",
        "\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that almost anyone, no matter who they are, can appreciate a good joke; good being the key word. However, one person\u2019s opinion of what is good may be the exact opposite of the next person\u2019s, because it\u2019s all based on perspective. Well, I happen to have an opinion on this joke attempted by the Slayer crew; it sucks. Seriously, what was going through the bands mind when they decided that releasing a single with one pathetic cover song would be a good idea? Additionally, of all bands, why did they choose Verbal Abuse?\n\nYou\u2019d think a song like this would be completely unfitting for Slayer\u2019s style, even if it is only a cover. Listening to these childish lyrics about how much they hate someone (\u201cI HAAAAAAAATE YOUUU\u201d) is embarrassing enough to make even punk rockers, who are more often than not the masters of retarded lyrics, grimace. Tom Araya\u2019s signature voice is barely recognizable at first, because it is somewhat concealed by vocal distortion as he yells and wails the lyrics with seemingly no effort at all. Accompanied by a vexatious vocal performance are a few simple power chords followed by some light strumming played over and over again; no variation whatsoever. At the 1:17 mark there is a short and slightly speedy guitar solo which sounds somewhat nifty and uncloaks at least some sense creativity in the musicians, but this song was a failure before it even started.\n\nThe steady and gradual mid-paced drums are really the only instrument in this song that strikes me as being halfway decent. Much like the guitars, they are extremely recursive, but they definitely demonstrate more competence than the guitar players on the level of musicianship and skill with more variation and slight speed changes. The overall song structure isn\u2019t contrived in an interesting manner; it reeks of monotony. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if each band member was given two riffs to play for two minutes, because that is what it sounds like. Picture Slayer playing a crappy pseudo-heavy punk song with a solo and you will pretty much understand how this sounds.\n\nShouting vocals with tedious and premature nature of the lyrics only portray the ineptitude of the bands ability to insult anyone intelligently. Thankfully, Slayer weren\u2019t responsible for the creation of this song; but it\u2019s annoying to think that the talent of Slayer went to complete waste by playing one or two amateur riffs. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at all costs.\n",
        "\nWell, this album is very controversial, loved by some, hated by the others. Let's see what Slayer offers on it. \n\nAfter a little intro that was not essential we come into the first song: \"Disciple\". The riffs are good, the lyrics too, justifying the title of the album. It's well play and the first thing that comes to mind is that Tom yells like a madman, the voice is too distorted. Catchy end in that particular song.\n\nThen the second song: Cool intro with some cool effect by Jeff I think, after that all we hear is recycled old Slayer riffs, well played, with good lyrics, but recycled riffs. After that song all begins to fall, but falling very deep. The third song \"New Faith\" begins with a cool riff, which reminds me a lot of \"Symptom of The Universe\" of Black Sabbath with some good very fast thrash breaks, but we have heard these riffs before again guys! The problem comes with the chorus, I can't tell what is played, it's just three chord repeated with Bostaph massacring his toms, with Tom yelling more and more with a lot of distortion, especially in the part \"I keep the bible in a pool of blood\". After that the song seems to be very disorganized, only carried by Toms vocals.\n\nThe next song, \"Cast Down\" is very boring, I always skip this one, it sounds like a slow hardcore song, with a little mallcore influence and no solos. \n\nThen the song \"Threshold\": the first time I heard it I couldn't believe it was Slayer, it was a brutal version of bands like Disturbed etc... Good drums by Bostaph and then Tom who seems to try (and fortunately fails) to sing like a hip hop singer (or maybe he tries to imitate the Disturbed singer, I don't know), it's maybe catchy but the lyrics are very silly and again there are no solos.\n\nThen \"Exile\", a fast song, but again ruined by silly lyrics, with all these \"fucks\" . What did you smoke Kerry? It's strange but it's catchy in spite of the lyrics. \n\nThen \"Seven Faces\", a simple intro with a lot of effect which give a dark and evil atmosphere, but ruined by Tom's scream: a very distorted growl with a lot of effects at the end. Why do you continue to try to scream Tom? It's been a long time that you're no more able to do your crazy screams like the one on Angel Of Death... After that intro, good vocals and better lyrics but an hardcore riff, slow and boring all along. This song is just a filler.\n\nThen \"Bloodline\", good song, but the intro riffs sounds a lot like some riffs of Seasons in the Abyss, it's again made of recycled riffs with some good thrash rythm during the verses and chorus. The lyrics are better.\n\nAfter \"Bloodline\" we come into \"Deviance\" which sounds a lot like \"Seven Faces\", with recycled riffs taken of South Of Heaven, mixed with slow hardcore riffs. Without Tom's yelling you'll certainly sleep while hearing it...\n\nMaybe to try to wake us after the sleepy Deviance, they come into a fast song called War Zone. It begins with thrash riffs played very very fast that we've (again) already heard before, and during the verse it's made like a technical version of a Slipknot song with (again) Tom yelling.... Horrible but that works well, strange no?! \n\nAfter this one they want to make you sleep again before the end with Here Comes The Pain, after a boring intro with Jeff and Kerry taking fun on their wah pedals we come into a song which really looks like a slow Hatebreed's song with Tom yelling at the chorus. Then we come into recycled riffs from South Of Heaven for the last verse and solo and come back to the Hatebreed's song.\n\nThe last song is a very fast one, all made with recycled riffs but played on a down tuned guitar, like a Slipknot's song. If you thought that you've found the worst lyrics with Threshold and Exile you were wrong. The lyrics here are just \"fuck, fuck, fuck, motherfucker\" but strangely it's very catchy. I think because Kerry was very influenced by shitty lyrics of the mallcore band Slipknot.\n\nSo I give a 55 because it's well played (especially the drums) but that the album is really Anger and Hate, Slayer really hates us all, it's Slayer after all. But I have to tell some things to Kerry, Jeff and Tom:\nFirst Kerry stop sucking Slipknot's ass and you're lyrics we'll be better, don't put to much hardcore influences and Kerry and Jeff, don't recyclate so much your past riffs, we want real new stuffs. And Tom don't yell all the time, and don't try to scream anymore, if you took care of your voice you wouldn't have all these problems with it....\n",
        "\nThis was the album that really got me drooling over Slayer in a big bad major way and it still makes me drool mindlessly every time I hear it. Picture this, if you will: the author as spotty 15-year-old geek trying to get a clue about metal back in 1985, huddled underneath his sheets late one Sunday night with his Walkman headphones on, listening to his favorite college radio metal show. The DJ comes on stating that Slayer's new album is going to be the spotlighted album of the night, and follows that statement with a wall of terrifying sounds--people moaning in pain, demons growling and gurgling, eerie whammy bar guitar noises, all over a sinister chant of, well, SOMETHING EVIL! It scared me silly and I was a changed man after that momentous night!\n\nSome of the best tunes ever recorded by Slayer are on here: that monstrous title track with its epic intro that gets me banging every time as I air guitar like a blathering idiot, \"Kill Again\", the underrated \"At Dawn They Sleep\" with its amazingly cool, atonally-harmonized intro that has you guessing where the one is--those first three tunes alone set the pace for everything else that follows. \n\n\"Praise of Death\" is a pure \"massive dose adrenaline\", to quote the lyrics, that will make you sweat like a horse just listening to Dave Lombardo's godly drumming--in fact, he owns this entire album. His double kick pounding on the bridge before the solo section on \"Kill Again\" will make you break your neck banging away in time with it! \"Necrophiliac\" has some nasssty lyrics (Araya used to get all kinds of explicit introducing this one live!) and has a great mid tempo bridge near the end with those trademark evil harmony guitars of theirs. \n\n\"Hardening of the Arteries\" has the most crazed and lunatic soloing on the record from Hannemann and King, but then I think this album and \"Reign In Blood\" were their pinnacles as soloists, with their chaotic and hectic leads influencing a whole generation of players, and that wonderful dirty, dark guitar tone leading the way as it slices your speakers to shreds--that's the rhythm sound I shoot for as a guitarist, myself, truthfully. Araya is on top of his game on this one vocally, too, although this is still a warmup for \"RIB\" and that heart-stopping shriek at the beginning of their best tune ever...aw, you know the title! \n\nSIGH...this is one of the very best albums of the 80s alongside \"RIB\", and I am very, very happy that I was exposed to it when I was...it changed my life on a level only Motorhead and the early Metallica has since. Need I say more?\n",
        "\nI screwed up the first time, so this is the review that needs publishing--my bad!\n\nAnyway, this is easily one of the greatest recordings in the history of thrash metal, pure and simple. This pioneering band of Angelenos tore it up but hard and laid the foundation for numerous other bands that followed with this EP, and it is both short and sweet as well as utterly monstrous and brutal as it gets. Any longer and this would have been too much to bear!\n\n\"Chemical Warfare\": Nuff sed. The guitar tone is one of the most evil and sinister ever recorded, chugging out that delicious chugging open-E string riff (well, E-flat in Slayer's case) that lets you know that you are in T-R-O-U-B-L-E from the get go. The drums kick in alongside the bass, building to a crescendo, then...BAM! That snare hit breaks it up and along comes the storm of riffing! Brilliant lyrics and Araya's vocals snarl and spit them out with vicious contempt, and the soloing is some of the best King & Hannemann ever laid down. The ending is one of the best noisy crashing finales ever, as well, up there with Manowar's \"Thor, The Power Head\" and \"Black Wind, Fire, And Steel\". \n\n\"Captor Of Sin\": Slower and *slightly* more subdued, but one of the ultimate headbanging riffs ever in the verses and chorus. Simple and effective, and when it picks up speed it kills, as you may imagine. Evil Satanic lyrics and more contemptuous snarling from Araya, along with just plain intensity that owns you from start to finish! \n\n\"Haunting The Chapel\": Aw, yeah!!! Yet another amazing opening riff leading into a turbulent, churning verse, which ultimately leads into--wait for it--MORE relentless thrashing for you to break your neck to! Killer soloing on this track too, and if this track doesn't get your pulse pounding within seconds of beginning, you are dead. That's it, that's all she wrote.\n\n\"Aggressive Perfector\": Meh, typical early thrash stuff, but still pretty decent anyway by the standards of the time. Good catchy chorus, of all things, on this tune! The intro is overlong, but I'll cut 'em slack for that given the Godliness of the rest of this EP.\n\nBuy this. That's all. Buy this opening torrent of one of the mightiest and most influential bands in American metal's history!!! \"Show No Mercy\" was an OK debut, but it was this and \"Hell Awaits\" that got Slayer's ball rolling like a Mack truck back then!\n",
        "\nThis little single pack comes across more like an EP than the regular \"one track\" single as it has no less than two unreleased songs tagged on. The production is quite strong, despite what many have claimed on the guitars are meaty, smooth and in your face. \n\n-God Send Death: This song is CLASSIC Slayer. Dueling solos, hammering riffs and lyrics about God, pain and the tearing loose of eyeballs. What more can a Slayer fan ask for? The riffs own, the drumming is beast-like, and the overall mood is one of confusion of violence. Kudos to Slayer for allowing us occasional glimpses at why Slayer is Slayer...even today.\n\n-Scarstruck: What a great title and a good song. Unlike Addict which kind of wore on me a bit this song kicks along with some decent hooks/riffs in the Slayer mold. This could have made the album had they bumped one of the previously released songs like \"Here Comes the Pain\".\n\n-Addict: Not as good as \"Scarstruck\", but still interesting. The riffwork is a little static for me, but overall cool. Lyrically, it's not half as interesting as \"Scarstruck\". If this had made the record it would have been the ultimate filler track, but in the scheme of an EP it works out well.\n\nThis is a \"must own\" for Slayer fanatics and a curiousity piece for everyone else. While \"God Send Death\" is the standout piece (hence why it actually made the record) the other two have worthy attritbutes that any other metal fan may enjoy.\n\nI am not on the \"hate Slayer for changes sake\" bandwagon, and this works out well enough to be bought in the used bin or scored off e-bay.\n\nSLAAAAAAAAAAAYERRRRRRRRRRR!!!!\n",
        "\nThis 7 track Live E.P. from Slayer should probably be a part of your collection if it isn't already. While if you were forced to choose, the full live presentation of Decade Of Aggression would be the one you should go for, though for any enthusiastic Metal fan this should be owned. It's a short selection of some of the more memorable songs from the Show No Mercy (along with a song from the infamous Haunting The Chapel E.P.) debut played with youthful energy and aggression. It's nothing to blow your mind, but something that's nice to listen to and get something out of. Most of the songs are played at an equivalent level to the studio album, but songs such as The Antichrist benefit from some speeding up. Tom Araya's introductions in between songs can raise some chuckles: \"They say the pen is mightier than the sword, well fuck the pen, 'cuz you're gonna die by the sword!\" before Die By The Sword and \"This is for all the cunts that like to spread their legs in the night\" before Captor Of Sin (or something). It's part of what makes the novelty value of the recording and a certain \"cool\" factor that seeps in there. Add to that the sometimes silly and inhuman chanting and screaming from the crowd, it sort of enhances the experience, 50 of their closest friends can't expected to act as civilised as a crowd in a big arena. It's nothing groundbreaking or essential, but it maybe garners this position since this has some of the greatest artwork done for a Slayer album. The grisly nocturnal graveyard scene complements the band's image at the time and really looks rather fitting to the early Thrash that accompanies it. My version includes the \"Haunting The Chapel\" E.P. which will have its own review but is also a reason to pick up this 1993 remastered version.\n\nIt does after several listens come across as pretty plain with minimal packaging and just a small selection of songs, but the version with the other E.P. included though should gain entrance into any Slayer collection.\n",
        "\nI have to admit, when this album came out I initially took no notice. For the first time in many years, I wasn\u2019t at the store on release day to pick up the new SLAYER album. Boy, did I pick the wrong album to blow off. \u201cDiabolus In Musica\u201d marks a magnificent return to form for the band. For me, the two things that push a SLAYER album from the \u201cpretty damn good\u201d category to world class metal are Jeff Hanneman\u2019s song writing and Rick Rubin\u2019s production. My favorite SLAYER albums\u2013-\u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d, \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d and now \u201cDIM\u201d all have those commonalities. \u201cReign in Blood,\u201dno doubt as classic as SLAYER gets, also was produced by Rubin, but the song writing duties were more evenly split. Although Hanneman and Kerry King both always have writing credits on each album, over the years they have begun alternating being the main contributors on albums. \n\nBetween 1990's \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d and \u201cDIM\u201dSLAYER released \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d in 1994 and 1996's album of punk covers, the ill fated \u201cUndisputed Attitude.\u201d After those two albums I lost interest a little. King\u2019s songs on \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d have definite punk element added to the band's thrash sound, and the album of punk covers just two years later left me thinking the band had taken a turn in direction away from their more classic sound. On this album, improved writing, production and a reformed style add what was missing. \n\nThe band makes their intention clear with the first song. \u201cBitter Peace\u201d begins with a muted slow riff intro before the full band and volume kick into the track (a la \u201cGhosts of War\u201d). Not only do they kick in, they double the pace and the song starts to really fly. The sound is thick, the band is tight, and the song is brutal. And just like that you know: SLAYER is back. They pull the same trick with the second track, a rhythmic intro straight into a heavier and quicker verse. The intro is short and the effect is that the listener has a couple seconds to catch a breath before plunging right back into the ferocious pace. Don\u2019t think its all a rehash of the past, though. The band tries a few new tricks, most notably the slower, groove heavy verse of \u201cLove to Hate,\u201dwhich also finds Tom Araya using a modified vocal approach to his usual gruff bark. This is one the fans will either love or hate\u2013-it works for me. \n\nPoor Paul Bostaph. As well as he drums, the fans always say the same thing: \u201cI wish Dave Lombardo was back.\u201d No doubt Lombardo is a legend, but Bostaph plays incredibly well on this album, and like Lombardo his contribution is a major factor in the band\u2019s appeal. He is a force throughout the album and his rolling double bass on the intro and outro of \u201cStain of Mind\u201d is just one example of how he makes a great song even better. \n\nFans always gripe when people compare albums to older favorites. You may or may not think this album is as good as \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d or \u201cSouth of Heaven.\u201d However, I do believe that if you favor the style and sound of those recordings then you will dig \u201cDiabolus in Musica.\u201d\n",
        "\nSo, finally a DVD from Slayer...\n\nLet's begin with the advantages: The quality is awesome. The guitars sound extremely heavy and sharp, the bass is audiable, drums are also very well. All together, the istruments sound brilliant. Take Raining Blood and its e-power chord interlude - its just crushing! Or War Ensemble, which - when it comes to the music - sounds better then on SITA. The visual quality is also professional - but that's no surprise. \n\nThe setlist is very good - contains some better songs from GHUA (Disciple destroys live!), a few songs from their more recent albums (although I would love to hear more of Divine Intervention than just Dittohead... it's a good song, but what about Serenity in murder for example?) and ofcourse their all-time classics - check the discography and you will know. As I said - I like this setting, but there are some songs that could be great here: Spirit in black, Silent Scream, Kill Again or Black Magic for instance...\n\nSlayer's on-stage appearance is very good. They don't jump all around but they don't need to - it's their music that does it all. Kerry may look a bit funny banging his bald head though ;). Tom rerely introduces upcoming tracks and speaks very little, but it's Slayer - they simply go there to play the music - not to have a conversation. So that's good.\n\nSo what about the drawbacks? Well, first of all - Tom's voice... I know that getting older cannot be avoided, but on this release he sounds particulary ..tired, not old! Ofcourse, you cannot overlook the enormous changes in his voice as he got older, but it's normal. In this case he screams as if it was very tough thing to do - I'm not saying that it's easy, no! But compare this to their older live recordings. On the other hand - he still sounds good in many songs. His much lower voice fits to the newer songs, but also Dead Skin Mask or Die by the sword sound ok. Im not expecting him to scream like he used to in Angel of death (he actually does it quite good on this one, even though its obviously not that famous high-pitched scream), but what about War Ensemble? I hope his voice improves on the new album!\n\nBut frankly that's nothing we can blame Slayer for... They still rock and kick ass. So why 75, not 85? Well, I don't really like the \"too professional\" production of the dvd. Ofcourse, it sounds great, but you can hardly hear any audience - you cannot see them too often either! That's quite disappointing, because Slayer is well known of the moshpits during their gigs. Take Sepultura's Under Siege - moshing, chanting with the band or the crowd singing the lyrics can be heard very good while the quality remains perfect!\n\nAs I said before - the sound quality is awesome, but there's the same problem that the Decade of Agression had - Jeff's guitar is too silent! It's not that you can't hear him - you can perfectly capture his sound, but I think that it should be more balanced. At least its not like on DoA, where Kerry dominated the whole thing. On the other hand, despite being a better guitarist (imo), Jeff plays his solos less accurately. If it was some kind of improvisation - it would be great - but how can we call Slayer's solos improvisation :P? (there are some good though). For instance - Seasons in the abyss has one of the best solos and - ofcourse - Jeff plays it like all their up-the-neck-and-down leads. No original melody, just plain chromatic ride...\n\nThere is also the (in)famous Fans rule section... Well I have some (very) mixed feelings about that. I liked the interviews, the moshing scenes (something which the actual video lacked of) and the general idea, but those fans are (mainly) - idiots. For example that fat teenager that screams \"slaaayerr\" at the end: \"you know...stuff... you know...well..you know..stuff\"... O_o. Anyway - this could have been a lot better. I would prefer to see some backstage stuff, more interviews - maybe something more about the gig, the instruments - etc...\n\nIf you are a Slayer fan - get it. If you're not...get it also - it sounds great and can be a nice show to watch. But don't expect to get the atmosphere of a real concert. Not here...\n",
        "\nThis is one mixed bag of a record. While being HIGHLY well produced (much better than the awful sound on the last record) and interesting on the ears, the song writing cannot decide on a consistent idea OR a consistent level of qaulity. Slayer have managed to catch up in terms of production to the almighty new days but some of the songs seem sloppy. It's almost as if Slayer is wanting to charge somewhere as quicky and devastatingly as possible but somehow got distracted along the way. (The flow of the album is that stunted sadly...a new song order could have helped!) \n\nThe band cinches in with its now typical thrash attack on such songs as \u201cGod Send Death\u201d and \u201cBloodline\u201d while others such as \u201cThreshold\u201d and \u201cSeven Faces\u201d try new styles before evolving into useless toxic crud. Other high spots are the descending \"Cast Down\", the smashing \"New Faith\" and the thrashy speed of \"Exile\". All these songs have strong points and should not be overlooked by any Slayer fans. (Sadly tracks like \"Here Comes the Pain\" and \"Seven Faces\" offer the fan little to crow about at all.) \n\nPick it up if you like the newer sounds Slayer have been pumping out such as \"Divine Intervention\".\n\nhttp://www.hellsrockandroll.cjb.net\n",
        "\nAnd if you don't like punk, you'll think this is pure shit. But these are fun little songs; about a minute and a half each, all of them a blast of aggression and energy. Nothing too overtly epic and serious - don't expect the crusher break of Raining Blood here. Try just simple stuff like \"I hate you!!!\", but done with passion and conviction; something that Slayer couldn't be accused of on the actual studio albums that came after this.\n\nThis is fun driving music... it's not something you'd want to pay too close attention to, because on close listening, it kinda falls apart as being simplistic punk rock. But hey, that's what it is... simplistic punk rock. Highlights... probably the DRI song Violent Pacification, or maybe the old Hannemann project DDAMM... or maybe Can't Stand You. Hell, none of them are particularly bad. \n\nProduction is pretty decent. Araya's vocals are just a bit overdistorted, but the guitars come in loud and clear, and provide the extra spark that the original punk bands sometimes had, and sometimes did not.\n\nOh yeah, but what the fuck is up with that original? Man, that song suuuuucks hard. Where's there any aggression in that? It sounds like Slayer taking lounge singing courses; even Dead Skin Mask is more fun than that song, and that's saying a lot.\n",
        "\nThis record is what every live record should be: raw, unproduced, rough sounding stuff. This being said, there is not a single moment on any track where the band sounds off-tune or unsure of themselves. Sure, Tom Arayas vocals might not always be perfectly audible, but at least they sound pretty much the same as in their studio records, which confirms the fact that Araya is without a doubt, one of the greatest singers/screamers throughout the entire genre. Elsewhere, the band are all excellent, Dave Lombardo's drumming never misses a beat, and the dueling guitars of Kerry King and Jesff Hanneman are as close to perfection as one could hope for. What does this all mean, you ask? It means that Slayer are doing what they do best, playing with extreme passion to their devoted fans, something which they started out doing in 1983 when they first started and which still continues today, which proves that Slayer are one of the best live acts in the world!\n\nAs for the tracks, they are all excellent, a tremendous batch of Slayers best material. Sure, there may be a couple that have been left off, but how can you fit all of Slayers best songs on a 2-Disc record? Standout performances includes old classics such as \"Hell Awaits\", \"Angel of Death\" and \"Chemical Warfare\" which for some reason stands above all other tracks when performed live.\n\nAll in all one of the best live albums ever recorded, something that their many followers should look to as a template for live performances\n",
        "\nNow, most people think of Reign In Blood as Slayer's best album, but I think it's their worst. Why? Because it's repetitive. it's basically the same riff over and over(Besides Raining Blood and Angel Of Death). This Album, is not. Seasons In The Abyss is my favorite Slayer album. The opener is great, there is no filler, and the last song is a great ending. The intensity is very high, especially on War Esemble, Hallowed Point and Born Of Fire.\n\nThe best part of SITA is the difference. It's way more orignal than the past two CD's they released (RIB and SOH) and has a better vibe. The production is top notch, you can hear everything. The drums sound great, the guitars have great tone, and Tom still has his voice. Dave Lombardo actually plays the drums! What I mean is, he doesn't stay to the simple Oompa Loompa beat like normal. He plays slower on some songs, and faster on others. He throws in more technical rolls, and uses more of his huge set. \n\nJeff and Kerry riff it up like always, but they do it a little better than normal. They seem to really put alot into this album.\n\nOverall, it's a great CD, and a MUST have for any Thrash metal fans.\n",
        "\nDemonic chants filling the night, virgin sacrifice, the pits of Hell, it is... Communism... no it isn't.... it's \"Show No Mercy\"... err, anyway... Having been used to the \"Reign In Blood\" to \"Seasons In The Abyss\" era Slayer for so long, this first effort and \"Hell Awaits\" really rekindled my interest in this band. I can relate to the people who viewed Slayer as a band they used to listen to loads but not anymore, it has somewhat had that effect for me, with the general style they solidified and made their own \"Reign In Blood\" onwards being a staple, a landmark, a sound to be proud of, but one that would wear on you after time as new and exciting bands would cross your path. I would place this just under \"Reign In Blood\", but its influence is probably greater. \nIts easiest comparison in influence is \"Kill 'Em All\", both excellent albums, but this really being more inspirational in my view, I doubt most of the more extreme forms of Metal would have been really born without this release. It is by far heavier than Metallica's debut and really the two combined are the most influential albums on Thrash ever!\n\nThe sound here is very fast, evil version of the NWOBHM with heavy influence from bands such as Judas Priest and Venom (though much better than the latter, which comes as no surprise really, they all bettered Venom it seems). It really holds middle ground between those influences and what the band would become a short while later (and probably Thrash in general). They write mainly short songs here which for what is in them totally fulfills, they have just what they need to be entertaining pieces of headbanging fun. Maybe I swing to more complicated stuff mainly but \"The Antichrist\" and \"Die By The Sword\" are just my favourites here, not the most complex but with Thrashy breaks and riffs to die for! Honestly they are some of the most exciting songs I have heard from this band! Tom Araya has higher screams and a bit more youthful energy to him, he's kind of at his best here while the rest of the band were still working towards their peaks. Sweet solos from Jeff and Kerry, I mean what really needs to be said about them anyway, they aren't overly technical or wanky, they're still fast, precise and do it just right here! Dave? Still great, he gets the job done here, he doesn't impress as much as he would later but he still provides that necessary power behind the band's incredible sound here.\n\nThe only song I don't really care for is \"The Final Command\", I don't know, too underdeveloped, too little thought into balancing speed with everything else... the rest is all quality material, some standing above others though... the aformentioned \"Antichrist\" and \"Die By The Sword\" mixing with \"Black Magic\", \"Fight Till Death\" and \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" to create memorable staples of aggression never forgotten. \"Metal Storm/Face The Slayer\", \"Tormentor\", \"Crionics\" and \"Show No Mercy\" just behind them as non skippable tracks that you must hear when you spin this album. Highly recommended!\n\nI own the remastered version, though no \"Agressive Perfector\" bonus track, I don't need another one! haha\n",
        "\nIs this the most underrated album of all time? Maybe. All I know is that it's way better than what most people give it credit for. Most of the thrash is gone, the songs are slower, the album is more melodic, and Araya actually sings here and there. So? It's a vast improvement over Divine Intervention, and that's what matters. \n\nThe best song is the first you hear, 'Bitter Peace'. It's pretty thrashy, actually, and completely and relentlessly in-your-face, and one of the best Slayer songs ever! Yes! While the rest of the album isn't as good as this, it sure is a cool album still. 'Death's Head' is the first departure from the trademark Slayer sound. It has lot more groove than any other song before it, and many metalheads hates this groove-thing that's going on with this album. And some people have the indecency to label it \"mallcore\". It's heavy metal, people! Wash your freaking ears! Now, the song itself is very good, with a nice tag-along riff, and a nice....GROOVE...Now, for even more....GROOVE...check out 'Stain of Mind'. Hip and modern, something all old farts hate. Furthermore, it's a bleedin' awesome track. The main riff ain't complicated, actually it's something I could play (WOW!), but it's damn catchy. Which leads me to this album's main advantage compared to the older Slayer albums, it's a whole lot easier to remember the songs, as they intrude into your mind, never letting you go. That's called catchiness.\n\n'Overt Enemy' is more of a slow number. Not as in ballad, but as in doomy and gritty. Some excellent harmonies at the beginning helps set the mood, and the riff that follows and leads into the awesome verse is very nice. Hell, this song even has a memorable solo! When did Slayer write memorable solos!? Halfway the song speeds up slightly, losing none of its excellence. There's some cool lyrics in this song. An even better song you can find in 'Perversions of Pain'. Again a in-your-face track. It's not as fast as 'Bitter Peace', but it sure is great. The guitars works furious rhythms, and the drums are blasting into your now damaged brain. I am of the opinion that Paul Bostaph is the best drummer Slayer ever had, and his work on this album is mindblowing. Too bad he wimped out eventually. \"Perversions of pain/seep from my eyes/into your brain/visualize\" Excellent and evil lyrics, haha. Then we have 'Love to Hate' which some people has the nerve to call rap! Yes, it sounds cool and modern as hell, but how does that make it rap? There are guitars, killer drums, and all the heavy metal there should be. I do admit, though, that this could've been a reworked rap song from RunDMC or something. Hell, I don't hate rap, so why should I be in denial? \n\n'Desire'....ok, so now the album takes a little dive. But only a very small one, for this is an alright song. It's midpaced (as most of the album is), and there's nothing really wrong with it, except the slightly lame chorus, and the fact that nothing really happens. 'In the Name of God' is a bit better, but you start to realize that maybe Slayer used up their best songs for the first album half. Still, this is good stuff. Again mid-paced, with a nice chugging riff, cool dual lead guitars, and awesome drumming. Halfway in the song gets more attitude, which MAKES the song, simply. Great section, especially the \"Antichrist is the name of god!\" And then we have a slow, grinding riff which just kills. Talk about a song going from ok to fuckin a! What is a scrum? I have no idea, but 'Scrum' is still a nice song. The section 43 seconds into the songs is cool as hell, and the thrashy section that follows makes you wanna headbang like crazy, maybe because there has been so little thrash so far. You gotta hear the solo, total killer. \n\nMore songs. 'Screaming to the Sky' isn't as good as 'Screaming for Vengeance', but hey, what is, right? Damn, now I want to listen to Judas Priest! I'll wait 'till this review is finished, I guess. Here I go again: 'Screaming to the Sky' is not that great. The chorus is a little stupid, there's extreme vocal distortion in the middle, which almost always suck, and the riff....what riff? Can't even remember it even though the song plays as I write. Forgettable, then. The \"Japanese\" bonus song, Wicked, is, in fact, also a European bonus song. So there. I just wish it wasn't included. Ok, so the beginning is badass, but six minutes of this song is too much. If it was cut by two minutes, it would be fine. The last song is 'Point', some of the thrashiest found in \"Diabolus...\". It doesn't sound like that to begin with, but a minute into the song, the thrash comes crumbling down on you. Awesome stuff. \n\n\"Diabolus In Musica\" is really a unique album. I can't think of anything else that sounds like it, not even anything Slayer. They wrote it a time where they were pissed off and tired of music and the music business, but that doesn't really show. It's not Slayer's finest, but it's not far from it. Vastly and horribly underrated.\n",
        "\nHere we have possibly the most well-known thrash album of all times, Slayer's legendary third album \"Reign in Blood\". What we have here is really an assault of fast, brutal riffs, cat-in-a-blender solos, thrashy snare- and double bass-heavy drumming, aggressive rapid fire vocals and not much more. The sense of melody they'd use later on in \"South of Heaven\" for example is nearly nonexistent, although there are a few hints of those sinister melodies in the mid section of \"Angel of Death\", for example. Then there isn't much variety either, all the stuff here except the first (\"Angel of Death\") and the last (\"Raining Blood\") could more or less be the same song- which really is the best way to take this album.\nThe 8 songs in the middle are just one epic thrash attack that menacingly says that it's not going to hurt you, it's just going to bash your brains in. And that's just what it does.\nNo one can deny that the riffs on here are awesome. I mean, check out those monsters in \"Piece By Piece\", \"Jesus Saves\", \"Reborn\" and \"Postmortem\"... awesome shit. And how about \"Necrophobic\", which might as well have been taken from \"Darkness Descends\" if it weren't that short. The brutal technicality, incredibly fast sung vocals, and even the long words are there, all trademark Dark Angel material. Great song. And then \"Altar of Sacrifice\" slays too. \"Learn the sacred words of praise, hail Satan!\"\n\nBut there are two songs that really make this a fucking thrash classic. We open right up with, one of the ultimate classics of thrash fucking metal: ANGEL OF DEATH! Brutal fucking riffs, badass lyrics dealing with the holocaust, and of course the crazy Jew-in-a-blender solo section. Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King can't play solos worth a damn, but that's what so fun about them. They don't make sense, they don't seem to have been thought out in the slightest, they just wank away out of key, making the most piercing noises they can come up with. And man, it works so fucking well, especially on this album.\n\nThe second highlight as I've mentioned is \"Raining Blood\". Starting with a haunting intro of pouring rain with the guitarists making eerie noises with their guitars, it kicks into this absolutely menacingly sinister riff, before galloping away into another brutal and fast-as-fuck thrasher. Lots of fun headbanging guaranteed. And watch out for the slowed-down middle section - a favourite in the mosh pit.\n\n\nFrom reading all the reviews on here, I guess you've kinda figured what to expect. Brutal, fast and aggressive thrash with not much variety. Since the songs are so short, it also might be hard to really get into them, which is why I'd recommend you pretty much take the whole thing in as one long epic riff monster. Don't listen for individual songs, cause there aren't really any to find, except again on the first and last tunes. Oh, and \"Postmortem\" is a standout as well, and the third best song here.\n\nDoes this deserve the legendary status it's reached? I'd say so. Does it deserve all the criticism it receives? I'd say so, all of it is indeed based on facts. You'll have to get it yourself and see how you like it. Personally, I dig the fuck out of this one. \"Death means nothing, there's no end - I will be reborn!\"\n",
        "\nNOTE: This review concerns the deluxe edition of the box.\n\nOk, so it's finally here, the Slayer boxed set which we had first been promised years ago (short before the release of \"Diabolus In Musica\", if I remember correctly), its purpose being to represent both a retrospective of this band's long and glorious career and an archive of rare, unreleased and generally difficult to track down material for the die-hard fan. A huge task to accomplish, and indeed \"huge\" is the best word to describe this release: three cds and a dvd, plus a bonus fourth live cd for the limited edition, all packed to the brim of pure Slayer energy. Sounds tasty? You can bet it is.\n\nThe first two discs are the core of the \"best of\" character of the box; for contractual reason, the studio material goes only back to 1986, since the first four Slayer records (\"Show No Mercy\", \"Haunting The Chapel\", \"Hell Awaits\" and \"Live Undead\") were issued on a different label. Fret not, as those old classics have however found their way into this collection as live recordings or various outtakes, as one would have expected anyway (honestly... a Slayer collection without \"Hell Awaits\" or \"Chemical Warfare\" would have \"SLAG ME\" written all over it).\nSo, the first disc opens with the almighty \"Angel of Death\" from the landmark release \"Reign In Blood\", followed by four more tracks from those sections (including the fast version of \"Aggressive Perfector\", Slayer's debut song); then off we go with five tracks each for the second and third chapter of Slayer's best known trilogy, namely \"South Of Heaven\" and \"Seasons In The Abyss\"... this means than on this cd we find half of the former and half of the latter, since they both show a complexive tracklist of ten songs. Talk about completeness! The first cd closes with three choice cuts from the early days (\"Hell Awaits\", \"The Antichrist\" and \"Chemical Warfare\") as their appeared in 1991's double live album \"Decade Of Aggression\", and despite it being a decision forced by the aforementioned contractual issues, the overwhelming power of thses performances leaves no room for doubt.\n\nThe second disc continues the journey in time by first unleashing five cuts from \"Divine Intervention\", clearly marking the band's progression into a whole new era. 1996's cover album, \"Undisputed Attitude\", is oddly represnted by \"Can't Stand You\" and \"DDAMM\", which are not really covers since both were written by Jeff Hanneman for an old punk side-project, plus the previously unreleasred Slayer original \"Gemini\"; although the selection might appear weird, any Slayer fan will definitely be more pleased to hear tracks penned by their heroes rather than any punk cover version, no matter how much slayerized it comes across (and last but not least, they all are good).\nFinally, \"Diabolus In Musica\" and \"God Hates Us All\" get their space with three songs each. Then comes the first real treat for the fans: a compilation of 8 songs which previously appeared on soundtracks, compilations or Japanese editions.\nThis section begins with the band's version of Iron Butterfly's vintage classic \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\", probably one of Slayer's best known covers and certainly one of the best in its perfect balance between the spirit of the original and the Slayer Sound injection.\nNext comes \"Disorder\", a bizarre track featuring Ice-T but don't freak out: although it doesn't obviously sound like your standard Slayer anthem it's not mallcore either (there aren't even real rapping sections, just spoken vocals). There's also a nice acceleration in the second part, although the song would have been better if kept a bit shorter.\n\"Memories of Tomorrow\" is a Japanese only track from \"Undisputed Attitude\", another fiercely sped up punk cover... very fiercely, actually, as it lasts for exactly 52 seconds!! Funny stuff, like much of that album.\nAnother sountrack contribution comes in the form of \"Human Disease\", a song that wouldn't be out of place on \"Diabolus In Musica\", as it keeps mostly a slow pace and quite a dark atmosphere.\n\"Unguarded Instinct\" and \"Wicked\" comes from the Japanese edition of \"Diabolus In Musica\" (the latter actually appeared on the European version too), and don't add anything that we didn't already know about that album. Both are pretty slow, although \"Unguarded Instinct\" is graced by some great drum work by Paul Bostaph; \"Wicked\" has a nice ominous mood but the lack of variation in the riff department undermine its consistency.\nFinally, we get two tracks from \"God Hates Us All\", available both on the Japanese version and on the limited collector's edition (which also had a cool multimedia part): \"Addict\" is pretty impressive with its odd tempoed passages, wicked riffs and angry vocals, while \"Scarstruck\" is generally faster and more groove-based. Both definitely deserve to reach a larger audience.\n\nThe third disc's label, \"Shit You've Never Heard\", explains its nature better than a million words. This cd has a great start with a very old live recorind (\"earliest known Slayer recording\" states the booklet) of \"Ice Titan\", the infamous unreleased ancient Slayer song; despite the obvious shortcomings of the sound quality the strcuture of the song can be easily made out. The song opens with a groovy rhythm similar to \"Crionics\", and features a riff that would later resurface in the second half of \"Altar of Sacrifice\", then evolves into a slower section, reaches a speed/intensity peak and finally goes back to its original pace; all of this spiced with trademark guitar harmonies and leads all the way through. Why this track didn't make it to \"Show No Mercy\" is way beyond me.\nThen we are transported into Tom's garage, where the band used to rehearse until around 1988, to hear the boys going through \"The Antichrist\" and \"Fight Till Death\"; the sound is pretty damn good for a rehearsal (Tom's voice comes out rougher and angrier than on the actual record!) and the performance is already impressive.\nAnother early classic, \"Necrophiliac\", comes as a 1985 live recording, showing Tom entertaining the audience with a long an hilarious introduction. What about the actual song? Is the rendition effective? Come on, guys... it's Slayer on stage, can you go wrong with that?\nSo we get to \"Reign In Blood\" with an alternate version of \"Piece By Piece\" featuring a bass intro that was cut off the final version; it's also intersting to hear the rest of the song since this is a rough mix and the vocals are lower, focusing the attention on the (unbelievable) instrumental work.\nTwo raw live renditions from 1986 of \"Raining Blood\" and \"Angel of Death\" show the band at the peak of undiluted aggression: the drum intro to the former is nothing short of ferocious, and Tom's raucous scream at the beginning of \"Angel of Death\" is just chilling.\nA real gem for the collector is next: two samples of Jeff Hanneman's home recordings, consisting of the man jamming to some riffs with just a drum machine. The songs in question are \"Raining blood\" and \"South of Heaven\", but despite the titles there's roughly one familiar riff to be found in each of them (check out the slow, ominous version of \"South of Heaven\"'s opening riff, is that evil or what?); the rest is a bunch of (killer) riffs we've never quite heard before, many of them paired with Jeff's insane soloing. If all of Jeff's demos sound like these, I'd be pleased to have a cd full of them, really. There's also a funny misprint in the booklet, as both tracks are marked as \"early version - 1996\" and \"1998\", respectively - never heard of an early version coming 10 years AFTER the best known one.\n1991 live versions of \"Seasons in the Abyss\" and \"Mandatory Suicide\" are next, both being way rawer than those portrayed on \"Decade Of Aggression\" (recorded during the same tour) but by no means less effective, althogh Tom's voice is a bit too loud in the mix.\n\"Mind Control\" comes from a 1994 concert in Brazil, and is best described as a three minute slab of anger, which represents the spirit of the song better than its studio counterpart from \"Divine Intervention\".\n\"No Remorse (I Wanna Die)\" would have fit better at the end of disco 2 since it's another soundtrack contribution, this time for \"Spawn\". You might known that all songs on that soundtrack were unreleased tracks born out of collaborations between groups of two bands working together, and here Slayer are paired with Atari Teenage Riot: the result is a very weird track sharing but pale resemblances with any other Slayer material with its electronic drum patterns and distorted vocal effects. An interesting experiment, but nothing more.\nFour more live recordings close this chapter of the box. \"Dittohead\" and \"Sex. Murder. Art.\" come from 1998 and sport a great sound thanks to a profesional mobile recording courtesy of Westwood One. \"Bloodline\" and \"Payback\" are from a 2002 show in Sweden and are the real downfall of this cd: it's apparent that Tom had problems with his voice that night (he sings the whole \"Bloodline\" totally out of key and runs repeatedly out of breath on \"Payback\") and the mix is seriously lacking, with the drums (or rather the cymbals) drowing out the rest of the instrumentation, especially on \"Payback\".\n\nDisc four, the DVD, continues the thought as \"Shit You've Never Seen\". The set opens with the \"earliest known Slayer (video crowd) recordings\" filmed at various venues in California between 1983 ans 1984; here we can see Slayer still wearing eyeliner and \"Satanic\" outfits, as well as Tom playing with his fingers rather than the usual pick (an dhear various of his high-pitched screams that marked old Slayer). \"Die by the Sword\" is probably the best, since you can see what's going on on stage and the sound can still be made out despite the abysmal sound quality; \"Aggressive Perfector\" sounds worse especially in the first part and becomes a real eyesore at times, although it has a nice close up on Jeff and Kerry in the solo trading section; finally, \"Praise of Death\" is the best of the three visiually (despite the grainy picture) but the song is made totally indecipherable by the horrible sound (and misses the final part).\nThings become slightly better with a 1985 recording of \"Haunting the Chapel\" from the band's firs European tour, and more so with three songs from a 1986 show in New York (\"Necrophobic\" - introduced by Tom in a rather funny way -, \"Reborn\" and \"Jesus Saves\") which show a very energetic crowd giving a hard time to the security bullies.\nFrom here on, it's all professional recordings, with great multi-angle shots and fantastic sound. \"War Ensemble\", \"South of Heaven\" and \"Dead Skin Mask\" portray the band running at top gear in Michigan, 1991, in front og a huge crowd, while \"Gemini\" comes from 1996 small club tour that followed the release of \"Undisputed Attitude\" as is the only available footage with John Dette on drums.\nWhat follows is a kind of interlude consisting of a short clip from the \"Kerrang!\" Magazine Awards 1996, where Slayer was elected \"Heaviest Band In The World\", and a presentation of \"Diabolus In Music\" with a short interview with the band (by the way, where are the subtitles...?).\nA live \"Stain of Mind\" follows, recorded live in Japan in 1998; the performance is great but I have to say that placing this song right after the \"Diabolus\" special (which has \"Stain of Mind\" playing most of the time) was a bit unwise.\nA live \"Bloodline\" (much better than the version on disc three, thank goodness) was filmed in 2002, while \"Disciple\" and \"God Send Death\" come from a hugely crowded open air show in France.\nSo finishes the dvd... and I'm just left asking: what is it with those focus blurs that hide the writings and patterns on the band's clothes on several videos? LAME!!\n\nSo... the fifth disc, exclusive for the deluxe edition. Its appearance is deluxe indeed, since it comes slipped inside the infamous Bloodpack (a transparent cd holder filled with a red liquid that REALLY looks like blood, completed by six small skull shapes that float inside it), originally used for the \"Seasons In The Abyss\" single. The audio track of the cd is also recorded on a black surface instead of silver (like the Playstation game discs), probably to avoid illegal copies being made. Anyway, this cd contains the recording of a show at The Grove in Anaheim, captured during the reunion tour with Dave Lombardo beating the skins. 13 songs that further capture tha band's raw energy on stage; it's not the best Slayer live recording (Tom seems to have problems with his voice again, especially at the end... not a big deal since he lets the audience take care of a lot of the lyrics!) but effectively seal the band's trademark as an incarnation of devastating energy.\n\n...which just leaves us with a great 60 pages booklet filled with photos, extensive essay spiced by written interventions from the band members themselves, plus a fake backstage pass, a cool banner portraying the Slayer Eagle and the box itself, shaped as a large ammo box.\nOverall, there are literally tons of interesting stuff to be found inside this box (there must be a rough total six hours of music), so if you are a Slayer fan you'd better go and take this thing home right now.\n",
        "\nTo this day Slayer's second full-length, \"Hell Awaits\", stands as one of the most diverse episodes in the band's catalogue. Taking quite a step forward from the already impressive debut \"Show No Mercy\" in terms of songwriting, this hellish (no pun intended) electric symphony is comprised of 7 lengthy and intricate tracks, clocking in at almost 40 minutes. Knowing that this would be followed by the hit and run thrashing deluge known as \"Reign In Blood\", Slayer's early repertoire can be blamed of anything but repetitivity. \n\nThe album opens by the very well know title track, which the band also used as a concert starter for several years and has been covered by numerous fellow metallers (Vader and Cradle Of Filth among others); after a fading in vision of backwards vocals, distortion feedbacks and random percussion we are greeted by a lengthy mid-paced intro, which already contains several different riffs by itself... then, a split second pause and the slaughter begins! This is the first real track where Tom Araya unleashes his well known ultrafast word spitting, something I have always admired (and is a revealed source of inspiration for Cannibal Corpse's vocalsit, George \"Corpsegrinder\" Fisher), while Hanneman and King provide some of their most memorable riffs acked up by Dave Lombardo's inhumanely precise beats. A classic which fully deserve its status. \n\"Kill Again\" is next, basically continuing the fast paced riff feast; one of my personal favourites, with its numerous and original melody shifts and Tom's very inspired vocal performance, fitting the lyrics of the song perfectly: \"No apparet motive, kill and kill again / Survive my brutal thrashing (a declaration of artistic intent?), I'll hunt you till the end / My life's a constant battle, the rage of many men / Homicidal maniac!!!\". He really sounds like an enraptured madman on this chorus. What a pity I've never heard this song live. \n\"At Dawn They Sleep\" is built upon slower yet pounding rhythms with room for some occasional and well built guitar harmonies, to speed up in the last part (the verse where the band accelerates in real time is spectacular). \n\"Praise of Death\" is a more straightforward Slayer-trademark thrasher, the perfect interlude between the aforementioned track and the following... \nEnter \"Necrophiliac\", one of the band's most complex offerings, packed with abrupt yet effective key shifts and the by now usual (for this album) rhythm changes. Very interesting and strong, despite the laughable cheesiness of the lyrics (the title says enough). \n\"Crypts of Eternity\" begins with a weird sounding guitar intro to evolve into yet another epic; Tom does a really cool trick with his vocals on the verse, shifting the rhythmic stressing of the riff from the beat to the upbeat (it's easier listened to than explained), before a memorable chorus kicks in, its catchy groove owing something to \"Captor of Sin\". \nThe final track, \"Hardening of the Arteries\", is a two-minute flat-out headbanger which guarantees a blistering grand finale (it's like the band is wishing to anticipate how the next album will sound like) before a creepy outro, based on the beginning of the first song, sets in and fades out after a while. \n\nSo, there's really nothing to complain about when it comes to the strength of the material. A lot of people, however, do have a gripe with the \"excessive\" length of the songs here, and especially the album's sound. All I can say is that I find no big problems with the production here; sure, the vocals may be a bit too loud and the rhythm guitars might need a bit more crunch, but on the other hand the drums sound great and you canclearly hear the bass (!!!), and all in all this is the band's second full length anyway so a perfect sound shouldn't really be expected here. It doesn't actually sound very different from \"Show No Mercy\", which in my opinion was rough and good itself, but obviously your opinion might be quite different. \n\nI can do nothing but praise Slayer for releasing such an interesting album which never seems to get old, at least for me. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nSo, is this DVD concert the closest thing to actually seeing Slayer live? Well, probably, but listening to the live CD Decade of Aggression is still more fun.\n\nThere's a pretty good list of songs on this concert, but still could have been better: I was kinda disappointed that the twins, Altar of Sacrifice and Jesus Saves, with those magic riffs, weren't there. And some typical 80's sing-along classics like The Antichrist and Blood Red would have been nice, too. They could have left out shit like that Mr. Bean's disco-beat Stain of Mind from the Assholus in Shittus album (thank GOD they only played one song). And instead of playing so many songs from God Hates Us All, they could have played more from Divine Intervention. But I guess this is a God Hates Us All tour, yeah. Most of their other best songs are there, although there are no 80's era songs which didn't already appear on Decade of Aggression. They sure gave a good run on the songs from the album God Hates Us All.\n\nThe performance is nowhere near as great as Decade of Aggression. They have changed the structure and pace of some songs for the worse, and there's a bit too much bass in the guitar sounds; they don't sound so trashy and shredding anymore; they just sound very heavy. But the worst part... sorry Tom, you're the man, but you've had much better days. I don't know if he's been smoking, drinking, doing blowjobs for crack or yelling too much on God Hates Us All, but he sure sounds here like old Jasper from The Simpsons. When he yells, his voice is much growlier and less \"screamy\" (less \"puberty breaks\") than back in the 90's live CD - I'm not into the girl screaming he did on the first album, Show No Mercy, but I his normal screaming sounded better before; it sounded easier for him. I don't think he can scream like he screamed on Show No Mercy anymore, since he can't even get the legendary Angel of Death scream right; instead of a high pitched scream, it sound like he's trying to do an impression on Cannibal Corpse. It sounds like he's either getting too old or getting a cold. Some of the songs are not as good without this old screaming, but the newer songs and the growlier songs like Dead Skin Mask and Seasons in the Abyss don't suffer much from this.\n\nI'll name the biggest problem in the whole concert. I'm so relieved they didn't forget to play my personal fucking favorite, War Ensemble! Some sections are slower, but that didn't bother me much, as the riffs are so goddamn delicious, and fortunately they neither forgot how to play the solos. But... TOM FORGOT TO SING PARTS OF THE CHORUS!!!!!! You know, where he goes \"Sport the war!!! War support!!!\", EXCEPT the first time the chorus is played, he forgets to sing the \"Sport the war\" part, and the other two times he forgets to sing the \"War support\" part. I feel like something is missing from my favorite song! I was also disappointed about Seasons in the Abyss, because the long almost-2-minute intro is missing, and the way it sounds, it always brings a very welcome variation to the hard and mercyless trashing. Well at least my real favorite song, Raining Blood is nearly flawless.\n\nThe performance I was most satisfied with, must be the kick-ass Die By the Sword. The new songs, such as Bloodline and Disciple, sound great, and other good performances were Postmortem, Hell Awaits and Captor of Sin. Angel of Death doesn't disappoint me, except for the missing \"AAANGEL OF DEEEAAATH...\" scream in the beginning and that unsuccessful \"AAAAA...\" scream. They solos in the concert are excecuted well, although once Hanneman goes like \"I don't really remember how this went... so I'll fucking finish it off quickly!\"\n\nWhat you see is just the band playing and moshing like hell. There's pentagrams and devils, but there's no bullshit on the stage like the fucking naked gargoyle man or the vampiressess in Cradle of Filth's DVD, although I otherwise loved that concert.\n\nThere's not a shitload of extras on this DVD: a very short photogallery, the Bloodline music video, and the 50-minute documentary, which is great and will make you laugh the shit out of yourself. The fuckumentary has interesting interviews with Araya, Hanneman and King, and they're all really funny guys; Araya has some great jokes, King just looks and has always hilarious, and Hanneman seems to be most interested of beer and boobs, and we even get some chit-chat from Metallica's Kirk Hammet and Anthrax's ridiculous vocalist. There are many interviews with uh... \"fans\", and it's really funny but also worrying - well in fact it's shocking, to see how stupid people there really can exist. There's not a single smart one among the 20-30 fans they interview - they're all so fucked up in the head I feel sorry for them. They all think satanism is cool, some of them like nazis, and they claim they would mutilate themselves if Tom Araya told them to. One poor sucker says he would not be alive anymore without Slayer since he has nothing else to live for, another idiot goes on screaming \"SLAYEEERR!!! SLAYEEERRR!!!\" like a lunatic, a father who brings his 11-year old son to a Slayer concert and raises him to sport satanism and nazism, and then there's this guy who talks and looks like he escaped from a mental institution or something. So if you thought Limp Bizkit fans were fucked up, then these people are one hundred times more fucked up in the head! It's better than the Ricki Lake Show! Fucking hilarious stuff!\n\nThis isn't apparently even close to the best Slayer concert, but if you wanna SEE Slayer then this is a must-have, plus the few extras which are very entertaining. This was the first chance for me to actually see Slayer, since I regretfully never have been to a Slayer concert.\n",
        "\nOk, I've been listening to this album alot now, and I'm getting tired of it. I would say Slayer passed their undeniably lowest point in that terrible Diabolus in Musica, and even though this is no great album, it's a masterpiece in comparison to Diabolus. Most old Slayer songs sound pretty same, and because of that, I think it's right that Slayer keep looking for a new sound, and I think they have already created an interesting rusty scrap metal sound. Thus, in the process of trying something new, they are now unfortunately producing lots of shitty songs.\n\nThis CD's got much better songs than Diabolus. Disciple, War Zone and Bloodline are highlights of this current maximum-yelling sound they are trying out. Disciple is catchy and the screaming sounds angrier than anything I've heard, and it's not repetitive like some people say; the chorus (which is great) only comes around 2 times and new riffs are introduced, so if you want repetitive, you should listen to Maiden's Brave New World - that's fucking repetitive. There's excessory use of the word \"fuck\"; Kerry King he said he wanted to write the lyrics on this in the way people talk normally; in some songs it sounds straight-to-the-point, but in others like Payback it sounds like they use the word as a substitute for having to make up more lyrics. But lyrics have never been very important to Slayer. War Zone is short and direct, no bullshit; it's heavy and has an interesting rusty sound, which Metallica tried but failed to create on St. Anger. Bloodline is like a sequel to the song \"Seasons in the Abyss\", and it's like Empire Strikes Back - good sequel.\n\nGod Send Death is OK but about as just repetitive as The Wicker Man and no more, and I didn't like New Faith before, but after listening to it 10 times, I found it to be somewhat interesting. Here Comes the Pain is trashier than anything on St. Anger, interesting but no work of genius. Listening to this album straight through is pretty monotonous, though, and some of the most monotonous and weak song to me are Threshold which sounds Korny, Seven Faces which has boring riffs, and Deviance is slow and numbing, and the rest of the songs are quite forgettable.\n\nThe sound is heavier than Slayer have ever sounded and certainly 10 times heavier than St. Anger, although it's not nearly as speedy and \"melodic\" as Reign in Blood. Tom Araya's vocals are violent screaming all the time; yeah, sometimes there's too much screaming and you can't listen to them if you have a headache, but I kinda rather like the screaming than some of the his \"singing\" on Seasons in the Abyss (the album). The guitars don't sound too crisp, but still, listening to Slayer from studio albums has always sucked compared to the live wargasm. I really don't know many other bands which have had shittier production on studio albums than Slayer.\n\nAnd for your information, I don't hate \"mallcore\"... just as long as Slayer doesn't sound like Limp Bizkit, I'm relieved. God Hates Us All doesn't sound much \"mallcore\" like you claim, with the exception of a couple of songs - much less \"mallcore\" than Metallica's riffless St. Anger piece of shit.\n\nBut still, here you have an album with the amount of good songs of an average 90's Maiden album. A couple of good ones, and many songs which sound kinda \"lazy\".\n",
        "\nI'm a new Slayer fan, but heck I love them! Initially I wasn't impressed by Slayer's music since the first albums I got in contact with were the newest ones, probably the crappiest ones. This album is the one through which I learned to listen to Slayer, as I was introduced their most popular songs.\nIt sounded very unmelodic at first, and it was hard to tell the songs apart, but it takes some getting used to. Raw and aggressive stuff - more so, albeit lighter, than Metallica.\n\nI never consider studio albums among my favorite albums - they're only like small samples of bands, the songs are distinguished into the better songs and the worse songs, and of course, live albums sound better. On this album, almost all the songs are \"the better songs\". Some of the most euphoric and catchy songs are the legendary \"Angel of Death\" and \"Jesus Saves\", the ultra-violent \"Captor of Sin\" and \"Altar of Sacrifice\", the rocking \"Blood Red\" and \"The Anti-Christ\"... there's so many that I feel like being unfair to the songs I don't list. I feel bad about saying that my most favourite song \"Raining Blood\" (it's probably cuz it has been raining for a whole week straight now, where I live, and I love listening to this song during a storm!). But I consider nearly all of the songs here excellent, and no bad songs - well, I might skip \"Born of Fire\" and \"Expendable Youth\" when listening, just to get to my more favorite songs. This album is not worth dying for, but it sure is worth killing for.\n",
        "\nThis album seems to get absolutely slaughtered by most but I think it's better than GHUA by far. The opening track Bitter Peace is one of my favourite ever Slayer songs, it just roars through at a hyper speed. The 2 that follow it, Death's Hand and Stain of Mind are also very good catchy metal songs. Overt Enemy and Perversions of Pain are where things begin to take a nosedive, however these are 2 satisfactory songs. After that we enter the 12 minutes of shit. Love to Hate could be passed off as listenable filler, but Desire and In The Name Of God are both terrible. They're not particularly fast...infact they aren't fast and I'm really not sure what they were trying to achieve with these songs, they sound quite alot like Slipknot worship but I'd hesitate to call them nu metal. Scrum is where things pick back up, a fast paced track that is very welcome after the two abortions before it. Screaming For the Sky is more listenable filler, Wicked is just too long and is very boring, and the final track on the album, Point, is fast and aggressive, just like Slayer SHOULD be.\n\nOverall this album is pretty much Slayer's worst album in many people's eyes, but personally I think a fair bit of it ranges from good (Death's Hand, Overt Enemy) to GREAT (Bitter Peace, Point). Basically if they took off Desire, In The Name Of God and Wicked it'd make the album a fair bit better. Love to Hate and Screaming From The Sky are basically 2 filler songs, but they sound good enough to keep the mood of the album.\n\nMusically Slayer all play pretty well. Tom Araya does sound alot more of a hardcore vocalist these days, but Paul puts out one fantastic drum performance when the pace picks up. The riffs are great, groove driven mostly, and Hannemann handles them well. Kerry King's solos, as ever, sound like a dial up modem and he really adds nothing to the band. Overall though, this is a decent album, I'd recommend buying it if you see it used for cheap purely because the first 3 and the last track are very good indeed.\n",
        "\nSlayer's \"Live Intrusion\" is a concert video with a bit of off stage antics thrown in between songs. They perform nicely, and show their lighter side when they aren't kicking ass on the stage.\n\nThey open up with Raining Blood, which is the perfect opener. Everyone knows the opening \"duh duh duh...... duh duh duh.....\" to the song, and the crowd stirs with anticipation. When the song kicks into gear, the band bang the shit out of their head, and the crowd joins in.\n\nThe song turns into Killing Fields after the lyrics are done, and they pull off a nice transition.\n\nThey then play War Ensemble, which of course, the crowds goes crazy for.\n\nNext they play At Dawn They Sleep, which is a bit boring. Tom starts chanting \"KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL\" during the song, which sort of sounds retarded.\n\nThe concert goes on, with most of the songs kicking ass (exceptions being Divine Intervention and 213).\n\nThey pull off most of the songs nicely. The drumming is a bit flat at times, but what do you expect from Bostaph? Five (out of fifteen) songs are off of Divine Intervention, which sort of sucks, but you get the classics thrown in between.\n\nNear the end of the video they play Witching Hour (Venom), along with members of Machine Head. They perform great, considering there are about six people playing the song when only three did it originally.\n\nThe off stage antics are great. You'll see everything from signings (and people being thrown out of signings...) to pranks on people sleeping, to backstage games, to airplane boredom gone wrong. It looks like Slayer could compete against SoD for their backstage antics.\n",
        "\nSouth of Heaven = too slow.\nReign in Blood = too fast.\nSeasons in the Abyss = just right.\n\nAh yes, I recall those fuzzy days when Slayer was a force to be reckoned with, the heaviest fucking band in the world. The days when I scrawled Slayer on any nearby flat surface, the days when metal was new and Slayer was best. I've come a long way since then (4 years ago!) but Slayer still kicks ass, and Seasons in the Abyss is their most balanced and consistent album..... you have slow and grinding songs like Expendable Youth and Skeletons of Society side by side with pure thrashers.... it's a regular metal block party. There are so many classics on this bad boy it becomes ridiculous.\n\nMessers Hanneman and King shred the fucker up... Seasons was perhaps their peak as far as riffage goes. Nothing drastic, just 3 or 4 killer riffs per song. Hollow Point is the exception... talk about thrash! Songs like Spirit in Black and War Ensemble SCREAM heavy fucking metal... who hasn't screamed FORWARD TO WARRRR at an unsuspecting stranger for no apparent reason? It's like a rite of passage\n\nOn with the \"slow jams\". Dead Skin Mask is Slayer's twisted ode to Ed Gein... talk about creepy. They really hit a nerve... especially when the little kid comes in with \"mr. gein.... mr gein? MR GEIN?\". Seasons in the Abyss is one of the songs that turned me onto this thing in the first place so I must appreciate.\n\nNot exactly a blazing thrasher... solid nonetheless. Essential for fans of metal.\n",
        "\nAfter the quite embarrassing effort they put in Diabolus in Musica, the pressure was turned up for Slayer to produce something worth spending time and money on. A statement from Kerry King underlined that they were still searching for a new style, but also trying to get back to the roots. To an album more in the vein of Reign in blood, but with new touch. Sounds like a super-deal, we could end up with another South of Heaven. Oh well, back to reality. The truth is that Slayers last great album was made thirteen years ago and was named \u201cSeasons in the Abyss\u201d. 4 more records were made, no one that made any real significance. The downward spiral is obvious, but you can\u2019t ever take anything for granted in the music-industry. As earlier stated I don\u2019t expect Slayer to do another Reign in blood or another South of heaven, but I do expect them to rise up with their heads high. \n\nBack to this album, number ten in the row. Is it the trash-revolution the people so eagerly need? To end the cries fast, no it is not. But it sure is better than Diabolus in Musica. Kicks off with an intro named Darkness of Christ. Kickass riffs and sampled voice makes this a fucking awesome way to start the album. Araya kicks in at 1:06 screaming the hell out of himself. Only problem is that the vocals-effects uses voice-distortion. Waaaaay too much. The lyrics are pretty interesting, but speaks highly of fascism, which in my eyes, don\u2019t give any fucking extra credits what so ever. \u201cAll men are not created equal, only the strong will prosper; only the strong will conquer.\u201d I remember reading similarities in the infamous \u201cMein Kampf\u201d written by Adolf Hitler. Oh well, since the distortion on the vocals is so fucking messed up you don\u2019t get to hear much anyways. Fades out with the words \u201cGod hates us all\u201d\nscreamed by Araya.\n\nNext batter up is Disciple and this is easily the best full-length tune on this album. Tons of great riffs and this I call a resurgence of trash. Paul Bostaph makes his life performance in this song, beating the skin with a technical precision not many can produce. The chorus is catchy as fuck, \u201cGod Hates Us All!\u201d After the first chorus comes a solo. A good solo. Yes, I said good, can it be possible? Apparently yes, since this solo fucking owns. Fast, precise and pure Hanneman-style! After the solo a riff enters, a riff with such intensity, it will blow you away. Same intensity like that unforgettable opening riff of Angel of Death! Yep, it\u2019s good. Lots of riffs, lots of headbanging. \n\nAfter Disciple it turns into a downward spiral. God Send Death is not especially good, the riffs aren\u2019t there the lyrics are sub-decent and the solos forgettable. Cool effects at 1:58 do not help it. Desperate need of riffs. New Faith and Cast Down after God Send Death aren\u2019t better either. Too much mallcore influence over them. The riffs are boring; the song are meant to sound fast and angry but sounds pretty slow and boring. Paul Bostaph is a competent drummer but he cannot lift these songs. Cast Down has some catchy rhythm at 0:39 but the \u201ctrash\u201d-break after the riff are sleepy, uninspiring and annoying. Repetitive and boring. A really don\u2019t need to review threshold any closer since it suffers from the same syndromes that Cast Down and New Faith has. Repetitive, mallcore-influence, boring. \n\nNext up is Wicked. Distorted guitar picks a bit on the strings, making an intro, rest of the instruments kick in at 0:20. Boring riff. Is it even a riff? Slow song, a bit atmospheric but not enough. You just want to skip it. What about Seven Faces? Distorted guitar for an intro. Where have I heard that one before? Long Araya-scream. No high tones thou, too bad. Slow riffing, uninspiring and boring. The Nu-Slayer syndrome. \n\nBloodline. Soundtrack for the movie Dracula 2001, which had a competent manuscript but sucked over the top anyway. Decent song, nothing too orgasmic thou, but still not as boring and uninspired as the previous five songs. The video is pretty cool. Third best song so far.\n\nDeviance starts of with a cool intro, the cops radio and scream over the cool guitar intro. Too bad the riffs sucks and it sounds just like Wicked or whatever. A bit of undistorted vocals are here to be found. Very welcome. A boring solo is to be found and its boring, I can tell you. Double bass-druming on War Zone, haven\u2019t heard it since Disciple. To bad the riffs are boring and the screaming is horrid. Here comes the pain sucks and Payback sucks. Sucks might be a hard-to-define word. But Slayer can do better than this. Far better.\n\nDisciple and Darkness of Christ kicks ass. Bloodline is decent. The rest is forgettable. No one expects Slayer to do another ultra-mega-trash-masterpiece but as earlier stated we DO expect them to go out with grace.\n",
        "\nFor those paying attention, the musical direction of Slayer seemed a little dubious back in 1997. They were putting out Diabolus in Musica which had various hints of nu-metal in it and was a little less murderous than one might expect from Slayer. Not to say it was bad, but it certainly could not hold up to the classics.\n\nFortunately (or unfortunately depending on which side you're on), the naysayers, the pessimistic bitches who predicted Slayer's demise have had their asses kicked in a fashion so brutal words cannot describe it. The demonic riff-factory have created an album more vicious than anything before. This is one of the heaviest, scariest, most evil, church-burning, bible-bashing, Christian-raping albums of all time.\n\nConsider the vocals. Tom Araya's pained scream has been augmented by new production causing him to sound even more tortured and hateful. The sound replaces the bright, happy tone found on Diabolus. It's quite welcome. Such a horrifying sound accents the endlessly bleak lyrics about how the human race has been forsaken by God and we should all kill each other.\n\nRiffs and songwriting have not been this good since Reign In Blood. Chugging power chords are played at lightning speeds while Paul Bostaph creates fearsome techinical drumbeats with mechanical precision. The riffs are incredibly powerful. I'm not sure what goes on in Kerry King's shiny bald head to so consistently come up with this kind of genius. All the while King and Hanneman crank out their usual shrieking atonal solos for which this band is known.\n\nIf there is any complaint to be lodged here, it would be about the absence of the evil harmonies Slayer made famous in the 80s. There is no reason a couple of these songs, perhaps \"Disciple\" or \"Bloodline\" could not have them. They would be far more chilling in effect with such fifths in use.\n\nThere are some people out there, however, who do not like God Hates Us All. Even more disturbing, these people have made some of the world's most assinine accusations of it. They have referred to it as nu-metal. Last I checked, nu-metal does not have fast guitar solos, blastbeats, and the pure heaviness of a Swedish death metal band. The people who do not like this album are the same people who don't believe Slayer existed after 1991. They are the same people who drive Camaros to work and marry their sisters, hiding their mullets in ponytails under NASCAR caps. Fuck these people.\n\nIf you like heavy, brutal, uncompromising thrash metal, this is an absolute must-have. It is so well executed and pure in concept that it is essential. Buy it or be damned to eternal cock-sucking.\n",
        "\nWell...it has been said that this one isn't exactly a live recording...And after hearing that, I really found it a little weird to hear the crowd's roaring at the same sound level of the rest of the instruments, tell me...don't you find it a little bit weird????\n\nI would not be so surprised if this one would really be a demo as the critics and some people I know have said...But taking that to the second plan, this is a hell of an E.P. Those songs sound really good, and are some of the best \"Show No Mercy\" numbers, with the exception of \"Captor of Sin\" from the \"Haunting the Chapel\" E.P. This one really sounds very precise...too precise for a live acting, and it cannot be denied that it has a good production.\n\nIf you've heard their first full-length this is no new stuff for you. You are only going to listen to the same songs being played in a more complete and good sounding way than the one in \"Show No Mercy\".\nThe highest points are \"Black Magic\", \"Captor of Sin\" \"Evil Has No Boundaries\" and \"Aggressive Perfector\". \"Show No Mercy\" is also very good, but that drum intro isn't as intense as the one in the original studio recording... \n\nThis, even if it is a demo, perfectly captures the spirit of an early Slayer hungry for blood in their truest beginnings, and it's a good album to get, but if you want some Slayer \"real live\" albums, then you should get \"Decade of Aggression\".\n",
        "\nWell, this is definitively not Slayer's best we have heard but surely it isn't the worst. Ok...once more, and I start to find this hilarious, not pathetic anymore because I can only laugh with such lack of musical comprehension by some... I find it very difficult that most bands (except for those losers called Manowar...) manage to keep playing the same shit years after years after years, without giving a turning point in their sound. Well, all bands eventually do that with time, some of them taking longer than others, but they always manage to progress a little bit. That's what music is all about...progression, evolution and the attempt to discover a new direction. We can't expect that most bands that have so much influential musicians, always learning new stuff every day and progressing towards a new direction, keep playing the same shit twenty years in a row just to please their fans...Open your ears, stop being puritanical, and accept the reality that music, like everything in life needs a breath of fresh air, live and deal with it, or even try to enjoy the new styles...\n\nSlayer have evolved in the last years, always managing to give us some good and new experiences in the area of metal, yet being able to stay faithful to their style and fans. \"Reign in Blood\" was good, but it's a dead era now, accept it, and welcome the new \"God Hates us All\" Slayer.\nThis is a different Slayer, with a really deep and hard style and a new sense of production, that ended up as being beneficial to their sound, managing to stay apart from the raw and brutal style of \"Diabolus in Musica\", evolving towards a more sharped sonority.\nIt's great because I\u2019ve never heard Jeff and Kerry strike those guitars in such a heavy low tone, and this is probably one of the most heavy guitar sounds ever heard in a Slayer record. Paul Bostaph was always competent doing his task of destroying completely his drum kit and buying some new skins and cymbals every day (he had to, with the intensity he stroke the drums they should have been destroyed by the end of the day...). Good and effective drumming.\nThe only low point (but almost insignificant one...) is that singing by Tom Araya, or should I say screaming, that although not being bad, it could be better on those songs with one of the \"Seasons\" or \"South\" vocal work. And finally...yes...finally we start to hear some bass by Slayer, as Araya really proved his point on this record...after almost fifteen years, it starts to have its presence...better late than never.\n\nSlayer turning into pussies or being commercial or even (my god...) beginning to turn into some sell-outs???? Well, hear songs like \"Disciple\", \"God Send Death\", \"Exile\", \"War Zone\" or even the brutal \"Payback\" to see if that is a possibility to occur in the future...This is really some of their best stuff!!!!\n\n\"Cast Down\", \"Seven Faces\", \"Bloodline\" or even \"Here Comes the Pain\" are also some nice experiences and what I could say that is a little bit at average standards is \"Threshold\", \"Deviance\" and \"New Faith\".\n\nThe lyrical work is all practically the same thing in the whole record: I HATE GOD, GOD HATES ME, I HATE YOU ALL, GOD HATES US ALL, I HATE, GOD HATES, I HATE, GOD HATES, I HATE MY NEIGHBOUR, GOD HATES MY DOG...basically all of what dwelled in Kerry King( and this guy has to be a hell of a catholic person to speak like this...)'s mind. For me the lyrics are the only weak point of this record, and although some of the things being really relevant, others are pure crap...\n\nWell, if you are open minded, I think you'll like this and it's a good item, especially with the original \"butchered bible\" cd package, to get. Puritanical fanatics...I will not even try\u2026it does not worth it...do what you want to do, buy it or not\u2026 it's your choice...\n",
        "\nInstead of going the conventional route of obvious covers and butchered classics, Slayer tap their punk influence for Undisputed Attitude.... you can really hear how much the raw intensity of bands like Minor Threat and TSOL affected their sound, particularly that of Reign in Blood. The covers here are 100% Slayer without sacrificing tradition so to speak... in lieu of sloppy strummed power chords are fast tremelo picking and the occasional solo. Undisputed Attitude may stand as Tom Araya's last admirable vocal performance, and that alone makes it a must for fans.\n\nThe originals I have heard: Verbal Abuse (Verbal Abuse), Superficial Love (TSOL), Filler/I Don't Wanna Hear It + Guilty of Being White (Minor Threat), Violent Pacification (DRI), I'm Gonna Be Your God (Stooges), and I Hate You (Dictators?) are done justice by Slayer's covers and then some. In some cases, they add another dimension of speed that could easily appeal to metal purists without leaving punks behind. Highlights include: Richard Hung Himself, Verbal Abuse/Leeches, and Filler.\n\nDdamm and Can't Stand You are culled from Jeff's days in a sloppy hardcore bad.. pretty amateur, but also entertaining. Closing track Gemini sticks out like a sore thumb... a brooding, ominous, and fucking HEAVY track about San Francisco's Zodiac killer. A great Slayer song, no doubt, and one that should of jumped to Diabolus in Musica, cos that album is in dire need of good material.\n",
        "\nSo, Slayer went punk. Well...almost punk, as I think that this one is what we should call a thrash/punk fusion. These punk covers were the material that clearly influenced Slayer in their beginnings and over the years that came. Hearing something from them like \"Show no Mercy\" clearly tells us that Slayer sound was a mixture between the NWOBHM technical riffage and the punk rock speed and attitude.\nCash grabber?? Well, I don't think so...why would then Slayer put out an album with some punk covers (not very similar to their style) instead of another \"Divine Intervention\" or a compilation that would make them and their money hungry filthy managers and record companies gain some more $$$$? But, although this not being a cash grabber, it's definitively not an album for all Slayer fans...This one can be dangerous to hear by some of them, still, is a very energetic album and it's capable of making you spend a pretty enjoyable hour by listening to it.\n\nWe cant call this a perfectly produced album...by the sound, and although not being totally produced by Rick Rubin, you immediately notice that this is Slayer...It's not a bad mixture or sound, I just think those guitars weren't sharped enough at that time and that drum sound should've been a little different in the end, but...if you like the though, raw and rough Slayer, then this is perfect album for you.\n\nIt's really an interesting effort, and I would say that the highlights of this one are \"Disintegration/Free Money\", \"Guilty of Being White\", \"Filler/I don't want to hear it\", \"Mr. Freeze\" and \"Violent Pacification\"... \n\nThis album also has some interesting details that every hardcore Slayer fan should know...there are two songs here that Jeff Hanneman composed himself in 1985 for a \"never came to be born\" speed/punk project apart from Slayer...Those songs are, the incredibly fast and hyperactive, almost mind blowing \"Can't Stand You\" (fuck...I cannot understand how Tom Araya could be screaming that way...MAD!!!) and \"Ddamn\", really a punk rock attitude song mixing some metal riffs in 1 min (!!!).\nThe other detail is the fact that this record has extras and some really good ones...\"Gemini\" is an original song written by Kerry King and with some cool lyrics by Tom Araya. The only total metal number on this record and some of the most sinister Slayer stuff they've ever made.\n\nWell, let\u2019s put this in some more accessible terms. \"Diabolus in Musica\" fans, get this because although being a almost, kind of 80% punk record still has some similar sound to Slayer's 1998 record and I think you'll like it...\"Diabolus\" haters...if you are interested in this one, get it...if you are not interested, forget about it...\n\nAs I said, not a Slayer album for all Slayer fans but in the end, it still manages to sound good.\n",
        "\nSlayer, without a doubt, are one of my favorite bands. I credit Slayer with getting me into metal in the first place. Slayer in the 80s and early 90s were the icon of thrash/speed metal, along with the likes of Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. However, God Hates Us All is not reminiscent of the early Slayer, it continues on the road Slayer have taken since releasing their last \"true\" thrash album, Seasons in the Abyss.\n\nMy one major problem with Slayer since Seasons... is the amount of distortion used on Tom's vocals, and much of the guitar work. Tom used to be able to sing and scream with the best of them, but on recent albums, there's been a lot more shouting and distorted vocals - not good.\n\nHowever, Slayer have certainly not \"sold-out\" or watered-down their music, you can still identify the music as Slayer's, and the solos are still there. Undoubtedly, the album is full of great riffs and songs, but some of them sound very mono-tone, much like the vocals on a few of the tracks (for example, New Faith is a very annoying track). Araya is definitely a better vocalist than he shows on this album. The best part of this album on the whole is the drumming. Bostaph's drumming quality is nearly to the same standard as Dave Lombardo's.\n\nOverall, the album's songs filter out as follows:\n\n\nGood: God Send Death, Cast Down, Bloodline, Payback\n\nAverage: Darkness of Christ, Exile, Disciple, Seven Faces, Deviance, War Zone, Here Comes The Pain\n\nShit: New Faith, Threshold\n\n\nThat gives you an idea on the quality of the album. New Faith is in the shit category due to it being so annoying. Threshold is marked as shit because it is the closest you can be to mallcore without actually being mallcore.\n\nBloodline is one of the only tracks on the album were the vocals are not majorly distorted, and it is a genuinely good track. Payback has a nice thrash riff at the start, though it slows down to about mid-pace in parts on the song. God Send Death is a nice heavy song, but it just isn't a \"classic\" Slayer song.\n\nSo, there you have it. After waiting three years since Slayer's previous release, Diabolus In Musica, God Hates Us All wasn't exactly a huge disappointment, but I expected better.\n",
        "\nThis was Slayer\u00b4s mid 90's attack. Many people see this as the new \"Reign in Blood\" that appeared in the middle of the last decade...Well, i personally think this has gone beyond \"Reign in Blood\", because in the 80's we had a brutal band with speed and in the 90's we had a brutal band with speed...and technique...\n\"Divine Intervention\" is without a doubt one of their best releases, a really angerful album, filled with some good riffs and an impressive sense of speed...\nSlayer here remembered a little bit of the speed metal roots they had and that have been forgotten in the last few years before the edition of this album.\nThis was also an important album for another reason, being it the first time another drummer recorded something with the guys. Great transition made at the time, after all we are talking about Dave Lombardo being replaced for Paul Bostaph, and it came to be a replacement of a god for another...\n\nBostaph is even the one who kicks the action on, making the ferocious drum solo of \"Killing Fields\" intro, a great song, really heavy going from a progressive slow part to a more paced up one, managing to create a great vibe. \"Sex, Murder, Art\" is next and it has one of the most amazing riffage of this album, being followed by Kerry King\u00b4s \"Fictional Reality\" and the probably fastest song on this album, \"Dittohead\", in which every sound of that drum pounding is like a heavy thunder crack, hitting you really hard with that speed. This song has also some of the fast riffing of the album...\n\nNext comes up \" Divine Intervention\", one of the greatest tunes on this album, with both Jeff and Kerry showing the highlights of their presence in this record. The intro is very good, being followed by a calm guitar interlude that antecipates the total devastation of the song\u00b4s rhythms. \n\"SS-3\" has some good riffs but it could be better in those parts before the higher pace breaks in, \"Serenity in Murder\" is another of Hanneman and King\u00b4s odes to speed, really another highlight on this album...\n\nThe last two songs are the doom-melancholic sounding \"213\", something really original, something i\u00b4ve never heard Slayer playing before, being really a high quality tune and the total thrash finisher \"Mind Control\" with some amazing blast beats.\n\nThe boys really got themselves together again, having recorded one of the 90's best metal albuns, and kept a little hope for their fans to see Slayer return to their speed/thrash roots, hope that that beginned to disappear years later with the edition of \"Diabolus in Musica\". \nThis is a must have for any thrash maniac. If you don\u00b4t have this album (or Reign in Blood) then you\u00b4ll not deserve to be called like that...\n",
        "\nBut, it ended up being an EP. The story is, Slayer played a short set in a studio in front of 50 of their closest friends. Well, not quite. They actually played 19 songs that day. Three sets. The seven songs played here are a mix-and-match, and pretty decently reflect their late 1983 setlist for the most part, except totally out of order (they start with Evil has No Boundaries... they hadn't started with Black Magic since April '83!)\n\nThe thing is, though, they played a total of 9 different songs. Which is what their setlist for the most part comprised of (unless they were an opener, in which case they played 6, but I digress...). They could have definitely put two others (\"Haunting the Chapel\" and \"Tormentor\", if I recall correctly) on here as well. And also, did you know that Show No Mercy has a long drum intro that they cut out?\n\nAs I said, this could've been a masterpiece. The performance is second to none, and the recording is impeccable. But the production completely leaves out a lot of essentials - one must find some bootlegs before that day in the studio can be fully appreciated.\n",
        "\nIt would still not be as good as The Highlight Years of Slayer. There are still half-a-songs to be found here (Sex Murder Art) and a few really shitty \"Mr Gein?\" moments. That said, some points of this album really fucking thrash like only Slayer can thrash.\n\nThis is pretty much the logical successor to Seasons in the Abyss, with both that and this being a response to the people that didn't like South of Heaven because it was too slow and variant - here, the slow is constrained into just a few songs, and for the most part the songs are fucking fast. \n\nThe real lowlight is Araya's vocals - while not nearly as distortion-irritating as on the next few albums, it is already a far cry from the clean shrieks of Classic Slayer. But the riffage, oh man the riffage... when this album gets going, it is EXCELLENT. Highlights include the opening sequence of Killing Fields, all of Circle of Beliefs, including the two different approaches to \"can't you see... there's no validity\", and of course the neck-violating crush of \"Dittohead\". \"Fictional Reality\" and \"Serenity in Murder\" are more midpaced vocals-driven songs that still fucking work.\n\nThe rest ranges from \"effective, but unspectacular\" (Sex Murder Art) to \"kinda goofy\" (SS-3), to an attempted rehash of previous title-track greatness (Divine Intervention) to utter fucking swill... I'm sorry but 213 is shit. Actually, it would be pretty good if it weren't for that fucking \"I need a friend\" cockswillfecalshit, which is a harbringer of the mallcore-related dimwitted stupidity that Slayer would descend into. That right there probably knocks the album out of the 80s... no one gets away with that sort of foul stupidity.\n\nBut hey, not bad. Even though it's sort of a retread of previous stuff, this is unmistakeably Slayer, and in this case that is a Good Thing. Also, the cover art is fucking awesome.\n",
        "\nAlong with Metallica, Slayer were one of the pioneers in thrash metal. The difference is that while Metallica quickly moved into other metal territories, Slayer stayed pretty much where they began. And this is where they began. This album is perhaps their most melodic offering (until \u201cDiabolus In Musica\u201d, at least), and involves fast riffing, shouty vocals, and good thrash metal drumming. \n\nThe first song, \u2018Evil Has No Boundaries\u2019, is maybe the best song on offer. It begins with the trademark Araya shriek, before moving in for the kill. The lyrics are pretty average (all Satan and killing and so on), but the riffs are fast and brutal. The solo is very well done, and actually reminds me of Hammett\u2019s guitar playing on Metallica\u2019s \u201cKill\u2019em All\u201d. Good first track, then. \u2018The Antichrist\u2019 is not quite as fast, it\u2019s kinda between mid and fast. You can guess the lyrics from the title. All in all it\u2019s a bit boring, but cool chorus. Next up is \u2018Die By the Sword\u2019. This is slightly better than the last, but the chorus ruins it some way. It\u2019s chugging along nicely, and is good for some controlled headbanging, but in the end, it\u2019s not going anywhere. \n\nNumber four is \u2018Fight Till Death\u2019 (where do they come up with these titles\u2026), another generic thrash metal song. Of course, it wasn\u2019t generic at the time, but now it\u2019s just so average. Sorry, but it bores me. \u2018Metal Storm/Face the Slayer\u2019 begins with some cool guitar playing. A really nice intro. Then it builds up in a cool way into a mid-tempo rhythm with (gasp!) some very memorable and catchy riffing. Then comes the \u2018Face the Slayer\u2019 part as I understand. Araya\u2019s vocals here are so sub-standard it\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s the guitars that save this song.The last third of the song just makes me sleepy. Track number six is called \u2018Black Magic\u2019. Scary title, huh? Actually the intro is killer, it sounds like something Slayer would make in the late 80\u2019s. This song is better than anything since the first track, luckily. Araya does little to impress me (his vocals, mind you, I\u2019m not talking about his bassplaying), but the guitars are very cool. \n\n\u2018Tormentor\u2019 begins slowly with a build-up, and then it\u2019s onto the same boring formula that killls most of the songs on this album. The chorus is actually alright , but the rest is forgettable. Also, it has a good solo, but what\u2019s a good solo without a good track, eh? \u2018The Final Command\u2019, has some very cool guitar parts, and the chorus (if it qualifies as one) is somewhat catchy. Short, simple and to the point for once. Then we have \u2018Crionics\u2019. It begins boring, but surprise, the verse is very cool, and the chorus , too! Araya tries to sing on this one, and although he doesn\u2019t quite succeed, it\u2019s nice with a little variation, especially since he\u2019s doing such an average job om the rest of the album. The last part of it makes me yawn, though.\n\nLast song is \u2018Show No Mercy\u2019, and usually title tracks are among the best songs, right? Well, believe it or not, it\u2019s among the better ones. A somewhat interesting guitar riff, and nice vocal line in the chorus. The solo is good, but by now all the solos have started to sound the same, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019m glad when it finally ends. \n\nSlayer\u2019s debut isn\u2019t a very good one. The songs are very samey, despite the somwhat melodic approach as opposed to later Slayer albums. The production is weak, and makes the drums sound like shit. The lyrics are dumb, Tom Araya does maybe his worst job ever vocally, and all in all it\u2019s just not interesting enough to warrant a purchase. Of course, I bought it before listening to it, but that\u2019s stupid me. If you\u2019re interested in buying a classic bSlayer album, try \u201cSouth of Heaven\u201d instead, or if you\u2019re into a more modern, melodic appraoch, go for \u201cDiablous In Musica\u201d. Aviod this one. \n\n",
        "\nNo, they could not have played EVERY good Slayer song. But they did play so many, and so very few of the forgettable and otherwise crappy. And besides, like all good heavy metal bands, Slayer sounds better live. Yes, they fuck up a few times, but if you want technical perfection, go suck on some Dream Theater!\n\nThey start off with Hell Awaits, which is the perfect intro - next moving through classic after classic: The Antichrist, War Ensemble, South of Heaven, Raining Blood. All of those are instantly recognisable, totally great thrash songs. Then, Altar of Sacrifice is pretty decent, and comes off nicely live, even though the studio version feels like it's missing something (eight more riffs and another minute of thrashing). Then, Jesus Saves is cool, and we get to sit through Dead Skin Mask, before getting to Seasons in the Abyss, which is the song Dead Skin Mask wishes it could be. Both are midpaced, both are grim, but one just totally shits on the other. Funny how things work out.\n\nThe last two songs on disc 1 will attempt to rip your fucking eyes out, and you'd better let them: Mandatory Suicide and Angel of Death. Perfect headbanging material.\n\nDisc two begins with two more songs from Seasons: Hallowed Point and Blood Red - both average material from the album. Then, they play some really old stuff: Die By the Sword, Black Magic, and Captor of Sin. No complaints. Then, they throw in the awesome Born of Fire, which is one of the forgotten Slayer classics. \n\nPostmortem next, though I still say after all these years that it should be exactly before Raining Blood, and no place else. Then, two more average Seasons songs: Spirits in Black and Expendable Youth. They actually manage to save the best for last: CHEMICAL FUCKING WARFARE. This song does not get nearly enough credit for being the be-all end-all of 1984 thrash metal, but at least they included it here, so I won't have to hurt them too badly (no wait, they did release albums after this which seriously sucked... [sharpens knife]). \n\nThe setlist - you really can't get better. Maybe a few less songs from Seasons (it was their new album at the time) and SOMETHING more from Hell Awaits - I mean, has everyone heard Kill Again enough times? I didn't think so. Or At Dawn they Sleep or Necrophiliac? But still, it would've been too much to ask for them to bring out Crionics or Aggressive Perfector or Ice Titan or Witching Hour, so you can't get better than this. Oh yeah and it's live, and it rips shit up, and if Slayer's not coming to a town near you 5 times this year (implying that you live in Antarctica), then you NEED this album.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing the godly South of Heaven, and being disappointed, Slayer decided to make \"another Reign in Blood\", reportedly. They failed, fortunately. The songs here are faster overall than South of Heaven, but there isn't the sense of incompleteness that RiB featured.\n\nThe album starts off with a riff that is pretty reminiscent of Evil Has no Boundaries and Angel of Death, and then the second riff is the one that is instantly memorable. \"War Ensemble\" overall is a pretty damn good song, as is the next one, \"Blood Red\". Then, \"Spirits in Black\" is very catchy, and a thrash demon at the same time. \"Expendable Youth\" is a bit average, and Dead Skin Mask is, frankly, quite horrible. It's midpaced, it's boring, it's only fun because the little kiddies like to hear about Ed! Who likes to sleep and dance with the DEAD! It's complete shit, and the worst Slayer song ever. (By \"ever\" I mean of the albums worth giving a fuck about, i.e. the first Lombardo era.)\n\nThen, the album REALLY picks up. Hallowed Point is fast, and also has great riffs. Skeletons of Society is more midpaced, but has a nice catchy chorus, repeated a few times at the end. \"Temptation\" and \"Born of Fire\" are probably the most underrated songs on here - both have great catchy riffs that forbid you to do anything but headbang until you puke, especially the middle part of the latter..\n\nThe last song is a true classic. \"Seasons in the Abyss\" is evil, vicious, and has the best guitar solo Slayer had since Crionics. It's pretty much the logical successor to the song \"South of Heaven\" in terms of atmosphere, and closes the album on a great high note.\n\nOverall, this is quite a good album - a bit sloppy in the beginning, but there is really only one total boner of a song, and quite a few good ones.\n",
        "\nThis is definitely the best album Slayer put out. After the brutal-as-fuck but nonetheless maddeningly incoherent and underdeveloped Reign in Blood, Slayer released this classic.\n\nAnd got promptly shat on by the legions of the \"tr00\" and otherwise brain-damaged individuals who apparently like getting half a song twice as fast. This album is just as heavy as its predecessor, and while it lacks the overall speed, it certainly makes up for it with a fair share of smash-a-guitar-over-your-skull riffs. This is definitely the most overall memorable Slayer album, on a riff level. All of these songs are very distinctive, unlike the general mishmash of some of Reign in Blood.\n\nThe title track, which is the opener, is a midpaced, menacing number - assaulting the senses both musically and lyrically (yeah it's fun to run around yelling \"bastard sons begat your cunting daughters!\"). It speeds up slightly at the end, and finishes at killer intensity. One of Slayer's finest songs. Silent Scream and the first half of Live Undead are a slight bit more pedestrian, but nonetheless have some nice riffs, especially the middle of Silent Scream... \"death is fucking you insane!\" This is a harbringer of things to come. Same with \"the paaaaaaiiiiinnnnn!!!!!!\" on Live Undead. You can sense the imminent doom approaching. \n\nHold on to your esophagi, people, and have the Depends Undergarments ready, for it is halfway through song three where this album really turns to \"11\" and grabs you by the throat, flips you upside down, and shoves you face-first into a toilet bowl full of burning acid. Insane pain burns through your brain, thorasine eats your veins!! Satan laughs as you eternally rot... and this is just the beginning!\n\nBehind the Crooked Cross is one of those insanely catchy thrash numbers that immediately forces you to get up and headbang and play air guitar and headbang some more and if, after three minutes, your spleen hasn't ruptured, crawled out of your anus, and run off to join the circus, then consider yourself lucky, and HEADBANG SOME MORE, damn it, because here comes Mandatory Suicide!!\n\nThree out of four doctors recommend MANDATORY FUCKING SUICIDE!!! (The fourth likes disco and Slipknot.) The ending little spoken word part is totally fucking insane, as is the rest. \"Spikes impale you, as you are forced off the crest...\" You like the spikes, damn you. \n\nARISE!!! Ghosts of War is the sequel to Chemical Warfare, and is just as fucking intense - it doesn't have quite as many riffs, but is nonetheless a worthy followup. Next is Read Between the Lies... \"There is no Heaven! Without a HEEEELLLLLLLLL!!!\" Probably the best line on there, and by this point your liver has suffered cirrhosis, your kidneys have given you brain damage, and your trachea was last seen attempting to hitch-hike to Saskatchewan. But, it's not over yet. \"Cleanse the Soul\" is a highly, HIGHLY underrated song, that turns into the most monstrous thrash this album has to offer ... at around 2.10 into the song, I SEE DEAD PEOPLE!!!! Empty altar waits its victim!! One of the greatest thrash riffs of all time here - this one is kind enough to rip your skull straight through your chest before setting it on a pedestal and smashing it repeatedly with a cinderblock the size of Kansas. THRAASSSSHHH!!!!\n\nNext up, the Priest cover. Dissident Aggressor. It's what Judas Priest should've recorded in 1977 - finally, the guitars are turned up to the requisite volume, and the vocals are just plain vicious. This song totally destroys the original, which is not an easy task considering who wrote the original!! Then, a bit of a downer in Spill the Blood, which is kind of another average song, but tracks four through nine, and even the second half of track three, are just about PERFECT - those six stand on a level with ANY other six and one half thrash songs in a row on any album, with the bare exception of those that begin with Darkness and end with Descends.\n\nYes, of course the album is worth getting. Unless of course you would like to stay alive, in which case, you're a pussy. Go back to The Haunted, thrash needeth you not.\n",
        "\nSlayer here release their second black metal album (it's metal, it's about Satan, it takes a proactive stance towards the destruction of Christianity, therefore it's black metal!) and this time they've turned up the brutality a few notches, while managing to stay coherent and massively riff-oriented. Some of the best riffs they've come up with are on this album, including the entire intro riff set to the title track, for instance. (The verses quickly disintegrate into kinda incoherent Reign-in-Blood-esque too fast for its own good self-parody, but fortunately only very very few times is the album like that.) \n\nMost of the album is marked by very overt tempo changes, and riffs upon riffs. Best illustrating this is probably \"At Dawn they Sleep\", with the entire \"driven by the instinct, of centuries of horror.... kill!! kill!! kill!!\" sequence. Also, they carry over some of the really catchy choruses of Show no Mercy (\"no apparent motive! Kill and kill again!\") and the riff insanity that made Chemical Warfare an instant classic: see \"Necrophiliac\" for some similarly memorable riffs. \n\nSome say the production on the album is a bit lacking - it's really not at all bad, and definitely gives an atmosphere of evil. The guitar tone is pretty damn foreboding, and Tom Araya's vocals are in top form. Dave Lombardo gives, as usual, a killer drum performance, and bass has never been really relevant to Slayer so I won't mention that. It's definitely an album worth having, and easily one of Slayer's best.\n",
        "\nWhat this album lacks in sheer raw power, it more than makes up for with classy solos, interesting songwriting, and great catchy riffs. A lot of people don't like this album because it's \"cheesy\" or whatnot compared to Reign in Blood (oh, I'm sorry, you prefer your goat sitting on a throne, with lower contrast? Well, bend your album Show No Mercy booklet in half and spill soup on it!). \n\nThere are really no throwaway songs on here. Everything here is either classic speed metal or classic thrash, with one exception: Crionics, which sounds like something out of the Stained Class sessions!! (There is actually a version from 3/28/83 with an extra intro, that makes it sound even more Judas Priest-like!) Evil Has No Boundaries has a similar riff to the openers of two other Slayer albums: Angel of Death, and War Ensemble, Die By the Sword has that great thrash break, and Black Magic, for a while, was the most brutal song ever. (In early 1983, it debuted in Slayer's setlist.) \n\nThe best song on here is probably Crionics, with Tormentor a close second... (there's an absolutely amazing 8 minute version of Tormentor on the same bootleg that has the extra long Crionics!) Pretty much everything here is worth hearing, and just because it doesn't have 87 riffs in 48 seconds, doesn't make it a BAD album. The songs are all well-written, and the lead guitar is actually quite superb (none of the cat-torture footage spliced into Angel of Death to be found here!) \n",
        "\nNow this is not a bad album. In fact, it is a pretty good album, but why people consider this to be the greatest metal album of all time is beyond me. It's an above average album that definitely pushed the envelope of brutality, but it doesn't have the raw heaviness of Darkness Descends, or the sheer frightful evil factor of Seven Churches (or even Hell Awaits for that matter!). \n\nThere are quite a few great songs on here... not just the first and last song, which everyone remembers (Angel of Death and Raining Blood, for those that have spent the last 16 years listening to disco), but also Postmortem, Jesus Saves, and also the highly underrated Epidemic. Those are probably the most well-developed songs on there: Angel of Death with the monster thrash break in the middle. Postmortem and Raining Blood together are a 7 minute thrash epic. (The line between the two songs was forever blurred when the CD was mastered incorrectly and the last verse of Postmortem began the last track!) Jesus Saves has that nifty intro, and Epidemic has a great middle break, almost as good as that of Angel of Death.\n\nThe rest... Altar of Sacrifice is not bad, in fact quite good. Just not... GREAT. It's a song that would not have made it to Hell Awaits - add maybe 4 more riffs, and possible. But, it just feels incomplete - just when it really starts to pick up, it's over. That's the problem with some other songs on here. Criminally Insane has that cool middle break, but it's only a few seconds. Necrophobic, well, for lack of a better term, is pure crap. Sure, it's 253 beats per minute, but fast for fast's sake never works. (Besides, if you want FAST, check out the demo version of Kruiz's \"The Last Dawn\" from 1986... 318 beats per minute of pure fucking speed metal!) Reborn, well, just another kinda forgettable song. Piece by Piece... they left out a few pieces, it's another half a song.\n\nThe album really does suffer in the fact that 8 of the 10 songs are under 3 minutes long. It's only 28 minutes in total: an example of S.O.D. syndrome. Slayer are capable of writing full, and interesting songs: check out any of the other albums with Dave Lombardo. Reign in Blood has a lot of potential, but it just manages to come up short. It's a fun listen, but not nearly as classic as some of the other Slayer releases.\n",
        "\nThe original three-song release from 1984 was the most brutal thing ever put out, at that point in time. Hell Awaits and Reign in Blood would further stretch the envelope, but it was this EP, and one song specifically, that completely demonstrated the raw violence that thrash metal was capable of.\n\nThat song is none other than \"Chemical Warfare\". This was the logical successor to \"Black Magic\", which had appeared in the Slayer live setlist in 1983, but was really not all that intense, compared to other stuff that was available by the time Show No Mercy came out in 1984 (the album was delayed for about three months due to record label vagueries, a similar fate would befall Exodus, whose Bonded by Blood album should have totally destroyed all in its path in the summer of '84, but didn't actually arrive until 1985, but that is a completely different story.)\n\n\"Chemical Warfare\". Lots of riffs. Insane lyrics. Total fucking brutality. The song that inspired everyone from Paul Baloff to Gene Hoglan to be faster, harder, and even more uncompromising than before. Yeah, and lots of quality riffs. There's a section that is Judas Priest's \"Steeler\", on crack, and about 48 other excellent riffs. There is nothing from '84 that's heavier than this, except maybe \"Feel the Fire\" from Overkill's second demo or the Possessed debut demo - but as far as actual studio releases go - no competition.\n\nThe other two songs, \"Captor of Sin\" and \"Haunting the Chapel\" are also very good in their own way - a bit closer to the Show No Mercy sound, though still quite brutal in the guitar tone and riffage. Haunting the Chapel has a similar intro riff to Aggressive Perfector but then goes completely heavy on us, while Captor of Hell is most similar to Die By the Sword with the vicious thrash break, times a million. \"Hot... winds of Hell... burn in my way!!!\" These two would, given the same production as Show No Mercy, not stick out.\n\nThe re-release of this EP includes \"Aggressive Perfector\", the 1983 version that appeared on Metal Massacre III. A speed metal song that would not have been out of place on Show No Mercy.\n\nI think that there is in fact a version of Show No Mercy out there that has these 4 songs as bonus tracks. You figure out which song sticks out the most. :-)\n",
        "\nThe great thing about Slayer's Reign in Blood album is that it's an album of great songs by guys who really can't play well, proving that the strength of an album is in the song writing - and while the members of Slayer may never win any talent contests when it comes to technical ability, they sure can craft some pretty evil numbers. So what happens BEFORE you learn how to write a song? You rip off your heroes. And since Slayer's early heroes were Judas Priest, that's what their debut album, Show No Mercy, ended up sounding like - a sped-up-to-hell version of classic Priest (Not that Turbo/synth stuff; I'm talking the GOOD shit - Sin after Sin, Stained Class...) - which is why I like it so much. \n\nThe riffs and song structures on Show No Mercy all harken back to the classic days of early heavy metal - very far from their double-picked angular/chromatic riffs of late. Lots of open-string galloping, pedal-note/diad riffs, unconventional perfect fourth/fifth harmonized riffing, and that classic tried-and-true method of guitar orchestration, counterpoint - it's all over songs like \"Evil Has No Boundaries\", \"Fight Until Death\", \"Crionics\", and the title track. The solos are also much more 'conventional' and melodic/blues-based, most notably in the descending/tapping run in the ending solo on \"Die by the Sword\" or Jeff Hanneman's almost-mellow melodic solo in \"The Antichrist\". \"Black Magic\" is probably the one song that comes closest to defining their later style, as the main riff has a nice descending parallel-third part that is similar to riffs they later used in \"South of Heaven\" (the song) and \"Dead Skin Mask\". \n\nWhile at first the style may seem 'weak' to those more used to the band's later style, the song writing is still top-notch on \"Show No Mercy\", and the album also has a wild streak of youthful aggression that (to me) they've never really matched since. I still think it's a worthy addition to any metalhead's library, especially those with a craving for the mid-80's style thrash/speed metal.\n\n(Originally published at LARM (c) 1999)\n"
