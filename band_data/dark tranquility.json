        "\nProjector is probably Dark Tranquillity's most divisive record. It is also their most essential album, in a sense: a lot of the further developments in the band's sound are contained herein, regarding aspects of their lyrics, instrumentation and the overall atmosphere that the band would shoot for in the new millennium. It is also an unusual example of the changing melodeath/Gothenburg scene, in that it is both goes with the then-current trend of abandoning the freeform structures and black metal influences, embracing the use of keyboards and electronic influences; and yet, Projector still stands as an unique, never replicated opus, in the band's and the greater melodic death metal canon.\n\nThe most evident feature of Projector is the expanded palette of sounds the band employs, moving within a melodeath and gothic spectrum, which results in one of the most varied listening experiences within the band's discography. Take for example 'The Sun Fired Blanks' (and let's shoehorn 'Exposures' in, one hell of an essential bonus track), which works as a Damage Done prototype with its fast-paced and addictive melodies backed by the archetypical Dark Tranquility kind of riffing that was synthetized in The Mind's I. So, in these tracks, we can see what the band would be doing for most of the 00's.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, we have Auctioned and UnDo Control. Auctioned is slow, fully sung with clean vocals, while UnDo Control has a vibe that reminds me more of the newer albums of the band since Construct, as it uses acoustic guitars and keyboards to build a foreboding atmosphere before exploding with a harsh chorus. Fortunately, both work well here and help keep the album a varied and interesting experience. Day to End is a bit less successful, being an electronic piece that is wholly carried by Stanne's voice, stretching it's range to it's limit. I've grown to appreciate the track more with the years, and fortunately the band has given this sound another go with the bonus tracks released for Atoma.\n\nWhat seals the deal is the extended use of Mikael Stanne's clean vocals. Although present since the band's debut, Projector features them front and center as the main driving force and hook, anchoring its voice towards the more gothic and synthpop influences that would start appearing more and more in future releases. This marks a clear divide in the band's style that's also reflected in their lyrics and even visual aspects, as the band would dive further down into psychological and modern topics and eschew the baroque poetry and mythological imagery of previous albums. This is something that the band is still further exploring in their most recent releases, with 2020's Moment featuring the most extended use of Stanne's clean voice.\n\nAlthough opening tracks FreeCard and ThereIn are easy highlights of this varied tracklist, it's Nether Novas that I would recommend for first time listeners. If Projector has a bit of every sound the band has employed since, then Nether Novas has a bit of everything Projector itself does. Stablishing a dense atmosphere with reverb-laden clean guitars and giving way to Stanne best -in my opinion- vocal performance, both clean and harsh, conveying poignant lyrics about melancholy and loss in a way surprisingly honest, mundane yet poetic, an almost precise middle-point to the approach DT lyrics are written before and after this album. Nether Novas is also one of the band's longest songs (after their debut, and not featuring any sort of extended outros), and makes full use of it's duration exploring the various moods that the lyrics, the album, even the band's whole career, have tried to convey. To me, Nether Novas is the Dark Tranquillity's greatest in a long career of great achievements, and I hope this review helps to further highlight its virtues.\n\nAlthough Fiction, Damage Done and The Gallery are for sure the better albums to introduce someone to the band -and I would concede that these are the \"objectively better\" albums-, Projector feels like the actual centrepiece of the Gothenburg band's extensive discography. And the personal, human, flawed kind of touch that makes albums less of a product and more of a statement. The peaks and valleys of Projector make for the more interesting and innovative album, a cornerstone of the band's development as artists, and an unsung sign of the genre tremendous potential to convey diverse musical landscapes.\n",
        "\nOften seen as the \u201cother\u201d band (In Flames, At The Gates, Dissection) that helped form the Gothenburg, Sweden melodic death metal sound, Dark Tranquility has remained the most stable of the pack. Numerous high-profile tours including stints with Opeth, The Haunted and Killswitch Engage has changed this perception of the band. Those in the know recognize Dark Tranquility\u2019s bi-polar attack of melody and aggression as pure brilliance. We Are the Void, DT\u2019s latest recording, reveals more quality and consistency by this legendary group.\n\nWith We Are the Void, Dark Tranquility once again displays the slick Gothenburg-esque guitar fretwork and straight-ahead drum work that the group first created twenty-plus years ago. Mikael Stanne projects his voice with familiar, decipherable agony. In addition, the group includes a myriad of keyboard-laden atmosphere that traces back to the Projector album. \n\n\u201cIn My Absence\u201d and \u201cI am the Void\u201d showcase a fierce, speedy attack that harkens back to the troupe\u2019s first three, death-metal related recordings. \u201cSurface The Infinite\u201d even includes a blistering, blast-beat drum assault. \u201cShadow in Our Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Fatalist\u201d feature an electronic ambience not seen on early releases. \u201cIridium\u201d finds a balance of clean guitar harmonies and nightmarish key passages. \n\n\u201cIridium\u201d also opens to Stanne\u2019s often hidden smooth singing voice. Stanne received much criticism for adding this voice to his repertoire on the Project album, but mostly that was due to listeners misunderstanding his dark genius. \u201cThe Grandest Accusation\u201d includes more of his soft crooning. This track is perhaps the album\u2019s most diverse cut, moving between emotive guitar harmonies, swift tempo changes and even nu metal-like groove. These bouncy rhythms paired with moog-like synth recall industrialized nu metallers Static-X during their classic song \u201cCold.\u201d \n\nWe Are the Void shows Dark Tranquility at the top of its melodic-death-metal game. The group manages to incorporate elements found throughout its illustrious career. While We Are the Void may not quite stack up to The Gallery and The Mind\u2019s I albums, mostly because those albums were revolutionary and the emotion displayed just can\u2019t be duplicated, but the album is definitely a highlight in the band\u2019s career extensive.\n\nOriginally published on en.metalship.org\n",
        "\nQuite honestly, the Gothenburg melo-death craze never enchanted me inordinately. However, if I have to choose one band from it to take with me to a distant desert island, it\u2019ll be Dark Tranquillity. And, if I have to choose just one album from their discography for the purpose, it\u2019ll be\u2026 \u201cThe Gallery\u201d. Yep, that one is my favourite creation from their now sizeable catalogue, but the album reviewed here resonates with me, too, only not as insistently. \n\nStill, as a third entry into the band\u2019s discography, this album ticks all the right boxes. The guys obviously wanted to make an impact on the scene and establish themselves as prime providers of Swedish melo-death, releasing full-lengths every two years, filling in the gaps between them with EP\u2019s. They wanted to matter obviously. This also meant that changing the delivery on this third outing was out of the question. If you look for a premiership in a certain niche, you\u2019ve got to stick to your chosen guns\u2026 more or less. \n\nAnd the band did, producing a pretty decent albeit by no means superior sequel to the preceding magnum opus. However, although the album adheres to the Gothenburg sound canons for half the time, there\u2019s this other half that may have unnerved the band fans back then. There were certainly quieter, more lyrical moments on \u201cThe Gallery\u201d, but there\u2019s this more impertinent sniff of dark gothic romanticism here which also claims the longer, more thought-out material (\u201cHedon\u201d, \u201cInsanity's Crescendo\u201d) where turbulent fast-paced tactics simply have no room. At the time the audience may have thought that those were mere experimental flourishes, but once the next instalment \u201cPredator\u201d arrived two years later, they had realized that the album here was a transitional one, the bridge between the style-defining \u201cGallery\u201d and the more introspective, stylistically more diverse fourth instalment. \n\nIt must have taken a couple of listens for the fanbase to get used to the symbiosis achieved here, but this is a very professionally executed one, the guys making it sound natural to hear the staple for the genre speedy bliztkriegers breezing by tranquil balladic sprawls some of which (\u201cInsanity's Crescendo\u201d) enchanting the listener with beautiful emotional female vocals and ethereal acoustic guitarisms. Surely the fully-formed by the time melo-death fanbase must have frowned at those moments, again they fill up half the space here, but given more time their status could easily be changed from a \u201cdubious digressions\u201d to \u201cbenevolent unquestionable presence\u201d one. Besides, the exact same elements have been used for the shaping of both sides, the melodic guitars and Stanne\u2019s growling shouty vocals don\u2019t get lost anywhere except on the short meditative all-instrumental title-track. \n\nAs a result this effort aptly jumps over the boredom traps as the element of surprise stands till the end, but how many were those truly bewitched by it from the very first listen is debatable. On the other hand, 40-min of samey brief hyper-active numbers (think \u201cScythe, Rage and Roses\u201d, \u201cDissolution Factor Red\u201d, \u201cTidal Tantrum\u201d from here) would have hardly made the band more respected players on the field. Ambition is ambition, and if you have the relevant tools and ideas to exhibit it, why not go for it? Just don\u2019t get sucked inadvertently into the experimental rabbit hole (remember the techno non-sense \u201cArchetype\u201d from the \u201cEnter Suicidal Angels\u201d EP) from where even \u201cThe Gallery II\u201d would be hard to take you out. \n\nThe third time wasn\u2019t exactly the charm for the band, but this effort is a fairly memorable part of their career, and not only because of its transitional qualities. It shows the musicians in fine form, confident enough to both nail sheer examples of Swedish melo-death asskickery and ring the changes in a seductive dark romantic manner. And they did stay on that same approach later as both \u201cHaven\u201d and \u201cDamage Done\u201d have been shaped quite close to the model applied here, one (\u201cDamage Done\u201d) slightly superior, the other (\u201cHaven\u201d) slightly inferior. Once the divisive experimental \u201cProjector\u201d was crossed off the list, the band saw no reason why they shouldn\u2019t keep to their melo-death pageants of old, and although a tangible sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu has started sneaking in on the last two opuses, it\u2019s nothing too unsavoury that can't be washed away with a few spins of \u201cThe Gallery\u201d\u2026 and the album reviewed here.\n",
        "\nIf silence was a noise, a bitter noise, it would probably sound like Dark Tranquillity\u2019s album Construct from 2013. With its manifold monotony, concentration on atmosphere, and cold, emotionless vocals, it creates a great development to the band\u2019s sound. It is a journey through the bleakness you want to have.\n\nThe further time goes by, the further you want to hide \u201ein the silence that only you know, what hides in the emptiness that only you know\u201c (lyrics from the track \u201eWhat Only You Know\u201c). It\u2019s no surprise that the band wrote their stuff during their darkest period, as Stanne once stated.\n\nEven more, the album is also an outstanding example for perfect harmonization of guitars and keyboard, making them seem like one only instrument you can\u2019t dispense. Already in the bridge of the opener \u201eFor Broken Words\u201c you can hear it all come down to a lower volume. It\u2018s the moment when there are only still a few guitar chords and a soft drum-beat. Then the keyboard softly appears, as sad and hollow as the guitar. At that moment you experience that they can\u2019t live without each other. At least not in this album.\n\nThe best example for a keyboard-driven metal-sound though is the track \u201eUniformity\u201c. Haunting keyboard melodies go hand in hand with slow and melodic guitars in here. Together they create a sound for your loneliest moments. It\u2019s not bad though because you want to be in these moments and you become one with the lonely silence of the album.\n\nThe heaviness of the guitars is reduced through the album\u2019s production to highlight every instrument\u2019s contribution making the atmosphere as deep as it is. Variety is created by an elegant balance of some heavier tracks like \u201eThe Science of Noise\u201c or \u201eEndtime Hearts\u201c and some more atmospheric tracks like \u201eUniformity\u201c or \u201eState of Trust\u201c. Sometimes you hear the heavy riffs only in the background while the atmosphere is taking over in the foreground, like in the album\u2019s final track \u201eNone Becoming\u201c.\n\nStanne brought everything he had for his vocals. While mainly using guttural vocals that don\u2019t sound aggressive, you occasionally hear some monotonous clean ones also supporting the darkness of the sound. He whispers to reach for you while you haven\u2019t let the silence overwhelm you yet at the beginning of the opening track. He slowly speaks to you while haunting you in the pre-chorus of \u201eApathetic\u201c.\n\nListening to Construct is like listening to ambient music, but with some bigger variety while still being monotonous and with songs that are traditionally-structured. Louder sections change with more quiet ones, but it\u2019s all one constant atmosphere. Like silence is also not always the same.\n",
        "\nI haven't even thought of Dark Tranquillity for a good decade or so, but for whatever reason I came upon the album artwork for Moment and it looked absolutely cool as hell, decidedly un-metal, so I had to give it a go. All downhill from the album cover, needless to say; an album that best exists as a t-shirt.\n\nEssentially, the album sounds like a decidedly b-grade melodeath album from 2005, so hearing this in 2021, and from a fairly well established band at that is real surprising. Cheesy ass synths, a bunch of thoroughly worn out, completely threadbare In Flames-ish, Iron-Maiden-down-a-string-or-two kinda riffs, it's not awful as such, just very forgettable. A few harmonic minor scale runs throughout; you know the drill. The production isn't awful but it's cheap, generic as fuck, kinda mid heavy and really lacking bite.. it's just not really all that great, especially for a big band with I'd assume a decent budget, a good idea how to do things, etc. It's a real headscratcher, a strange album that's thoroughly out of time. The lamest time capsule in the world.\n\nI wonder if this was put out so they'd have something to tour with? Either way it is thoroughly luke warm, as uninspiring as a cup of tea left out for too long, as unnecessary as a cordless extention cord. I wouldn't say the songs sound exactly the same but they aren't too different; a few bad mid tempo crunchier parts, a bad breakdown or two, a melodic part where the synths come back out to play for a bit, rinse and repeat. It's just thoroughly odd that a band that has been around for 30(!) odd years isn't interested in doing something a bit different, yknow? Like I'm not expecting a crazy left turn into lithuanian folk music or whatever but shit dudes, you must all be nudging or over 50. Do you really want to be writing stuff that would've sounded dated and corny a decade ago? It'd be like if Rage Against the Machine were still writing bad rap rock sorta thing; just mind boggling that this kinda stuff still exists.\n\nAnyway, it isn't painful to listen to, just rather boring and thoroughly mediocre. The artwork is great but otherwise I imagine I'll be forgetting about Dark Tranquillity for another decade or two.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity is a band that seems to love their unique style so much that they firmly want to keep it, no matter what it results in musically. As long as they will have success with it, it will also work for them. They keep using the same formula with which they had success for many years. This refers especially to their album Fiction from 2007, which is quite popular in the metal scene.\n\nThe music is atmospheric and melodic in the truest sense of the word. The lyrics are enigmatic and Stanne\u2019s vocals appear as mysterious in both the gutturals and cleans. These aspects may not sound bad and are also the reason why I stuck on the band.\n\nThey now have the same problem as Amon Amarth though and it already became obvious to me with their previous album Atoma. When you always use the same formula over and over again, you are in danger that your songs become increasingly flat.\n\nThe problem with the album Moment is that the more the album drags on, the more I struggle with keeping my attention to it. In the beginning, I\u2019m quite excited, but later I just wonder when the album ends. It\u2019s actually harsh to say this about a band like Dark Tranquillity, whose music consists of many multifaceted sections with tasteful melodies and a qualitative sound. As said though, it\u2019s hard to keep your music interesting with the same style over the years. Dark Tranquillity already failed with this.\n\nI rather keep listening to my favorite album of the band, Construct, for the rest of my life than listening to their newer material that sounds the same as this album from 2013 but just gets boring during the listens. It would probably be better if Moment were shortened to EP-length.\n\nWith just two songs of the regular version worth calling by name here, it is a disappointment. I like the opener and lead single \u201ePhantom Days\u201c very much because I find it very uplifting, particularly its keyboard melody during the pre-chorus. This melody also drives the song forward greatly. It is by far my favorite track on here and is followed by two mediocre ones.\n\nThe rest is less addictive, although it mostly consists of the same elements as the opener. The other song worth calling by name is \u201eStandstill\u201c though because this title describes the whole album perfectly. The song on its own is also near to the percentage I give to the album.\n\nAt least they should\u2019ve let their fast-played bonus tracks from the 2CD-version (\u201eSilence as a Force\u201c and \u201eTime in Relativity\u201c) into the regular album version because they\u2019re more attention-bringers than most of the other songs.\n\nI would like Dark Tranquillity to develop their style further steadily in another direction. May it only be slightly. It would create a bigger anticipation for every upcoming album. This means that even if you discovered their music a long time ago, you keep interested in new material next to older stuff.\n\nThe band will always please new fans at most, but older ones might forget them if they will go on with this and forget to keep their style fresh. I bet that for example, a move to a direction with punk-riffs would fit very well. I can guess that from the aforementioned \u201eSilence as a Force\u201c.\n\nFor the reason that Moment is so boring, I don\u2019t know what I should do with this album. I also can just listen to \u201ePhantom Days\u201c from time to time. No need for the other tracks on the regular version. Even this one song is in danger to stop being attended by me next time.\n",
        "\nI didn't discount this release when I first heard it because of my initial reaction to 'Fiction' wasn't great, but 'Projector' my favorite release from them of all time. This I felt it a \"B\" average because there are some quality parts to it, it isn't just a waste of $20. I thought that the vocals were solid (as always) though the guitar riffs are a little iffy. However, I was glad to get this recommendation from a long time friend of mine. I thought that the melodic parts were cool, even though Martin is no longer with the band. I thought that it was an excellent that Christopher Amott (ex-Arch Enemy, current Armageddon) is on guitars. Not that sure of Johan, but both do a great job!\n\nAs to who did the most songwriting on this release is obligatory. The guitars are superb, though not as good as they could've been. But I liked the album anyway. The music itself isn't very heavy, just emotional based. Mikael's vocals are some of the best that they've ever been, maybe better than even my favorite from them. The keys blend well with the melodic guitarwork and more of a feeling-based album. Mikael isn't sounding like he's crying on the voice but he's definitely in sad-mode. The riffs accompany the voice and synthesizers with absolute precision. And the production on top of it all is way good.\n\nIt was striking that an Amott was a part of this album. Christopher was amazing in Arch Enemy. I'm glad he clanged onto this release. He's one of my favorite melodic death metal guitarists just as Jeff Loomis (Arch Enemy, ex-Nevermore). So as far as the lead qualities on here, they're superb. I didn't think Christopher would last as long as he did in Arch Enemy since their style was continually evolving maybe into something that he wasn't into anymore. But him abandoning melodic death metal completely wasn't the case. And on here is another example of a great effort he puts through with this band. I suppose they did the band justice acquiring him.\n\nI was totally skeptical about this release being something worthwhile and yes it is worthwhile. So on basically blind belief I bought a physical copy of the album despite the putrid reviews. I thought that from start to finish this album has a lot of grit to it. And it's definitely feeling based which is what you want from a band like this. I don't think there's any song that I disliked from the album. It's not the best Dark Tranquillity to date from my viewpoint, but I did like it better than 'Fiction' of course. It's got a different feel than that album. It's definitely not an album to listen to when you're feeling melancholic. Great release nevertheless!\n",
        "\nI think I have rarely heard two records that sound as alike as Dark Tranquillity's Atoma and Moment. Both albums released within almost exactly four years offer atmospheric melodic death metal. Numbing guitar riffs collide with more psychedelic, progressive and dreamy electronic experiments. The rhythm section sounds steady without ever feeling urgent. The vocals vary between surprisingly smooth growls and melancholy clean parts. The song writing is also very similar as the different tracks very between three and five minutes that evoke mysterious atmosphere right from the start and slowly evolve towards mildly catchy and heavily repeated choruses that make every second tune a potential single candidate. The lyrics about societal issues are as mysterious as the numbing music and offer some room for interpretation. The production here is contemporary and slightly sterile but it strangely fits the band's perfectly streamlined and structured approach.\n\nEven though all those elements are highly predictable, Dark Tranquillity's Moment isn't a bad album. The band clearly has its very own style, is aware of its own strengths but also conscious about its limits. If you appreciate this particular style, then this album gives you anything you could crave for.\n\nThe real issue is that most people who own or know Atoma simply don't need to buy or even just listen to Moment. Everything on the new record sounds as if one had already heard it before which makes the new material less impactful than the predecessor's even though it might not sound worse if you didn't actually know the last album. One would have expected the band to offer some new energy, some fresh ideas and some ambitious experiments. The band could certainly do such as thing as it manages to play excellent darkwave songs as witnessed in bonus track ''In Truth Divided'' but even this is an experiment already attempted on the predecessor. An entire record consisting of this type of music would be interesting however but since other death metal bands such as Morbid Angel have commercially failed with a similar approach, Dark Tranquillity might understandably be hesitant to push things further.\n\nThat is exactly what Dark Tranquillity's Moment is missing: courage. If you are satisfied with vanilla music that sounds solid yet unspectacular, then you won't have any complaints here. However, I find it surprising that artists find it sufficient to simply copy and repeat themselves on two consecutive albums. Many people joke that bands such as Mot\u00f6rhead or AC/DC always sound the same. However, Dark Tranquillity's approach goes even further than those veterans have ever gone. For the next album, I will simply cross my fingers that the Swedish sextet will change its formula and introduce some changes. Any changes are welcome at this point since Dark Tranquillity's Moment sounds more by the numbers than any new k-pop band and I didn't believe this to be possible before listening to this record. The most exciting things about this album really are the gorgeous cover artwork and the two bonus tracks.\n",
        "\nA very long four years has passed since the band released their last record, Atoma, in 2016. After all that time, does Moment live up to their prior work and justify the wait? It\u2019s complicated.\n\nI\u2019ll state this as clearly as I can for those uninitiated. I love Dark Tranquillity and have done for almost a decade now. I got into their music with seminal works such as Fiction and The Gallery, and you can see my extended thoughts on their discography in the ranked feature on this site. However, I find myself torn on their new record. I should absolutely adore it, but I find myself doubting as to why I can\u2019t quite make my mind up.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what I do know. For one, It\u2019s a beautifully produced metal record and performances across the board are second to none. Mikael Stanne is one of the best vocalists in melodeath today and it shows, his profound lyricicsm too, elevates the material passed that of the band\u2019s contemporaries in the genre. This is nothing new. Thus we get to my biggest problem with Moment overall, it is nothing new, and after nearly half a decade of waiting, I was expecting something a little stronger.\n\nEvery hallmark that you would expect of Dark Tranquillity is on full display here. Synths, check. A striking mixture of growling verses and cleanly sung choruses? Present. Infectious hooks? In spades. The problem arises to the fact that, even after several rotations, I am still struggling to recount much about the record besides the singles, and that is not a good thing. Phantom Days and The Dark Unbroken are strong tracks that throwback to the band\u2019s grace period of Character and Fiction, with Eyes of the World beautifully reminiscent of the band\u2019s work on experimental albums like Haven, with the latter featuring extensive use of Stanne\u2019s richly warm baritone voice.\n\nWith regards to Stanne\u2019s performance overall, I was pleasantly shocked to have to wait until the fourth track on Moment to hear his clean delivery breakout. It was a nice change of pace in the formula. I do wish that the rest of the record carried this same defiance of the established normality, instead of leaning on genre convention, something that the latter half of this album tends to do, with the exception of closing track In Truth Divided. This song brought back a lot of memories to Projector, and I am happy to see the band harkening back to their more diverse category and trying something different.\n\nI won\u2019t go so far as to say formulaic or forgettable, but I will state how songs like A Drawn Out Exit, Ego Deception and Failstate seem very paint by numbers. It\u2019s sad to see musicians, as creative as this, coasting on autopilot, refusing to break the mould when the groundwork is laid to innovate and produce another masterpiece. These are good songs! Hell, these are great songs! Though, for Dark Tranquillity, and given all that time that\u2019s gone by, songs like these were really the best they could do in over four years?! It feels like padding, and it\u2019s a shame.\n\nThis approach could partially be explained away by the lineup changes that have happened between records, with long time guitarists Martin Henriksson departing after the release of Atoma in 2016 and Niklas Sundin leaving this year. Newcomers Christopher Amott (Arch Enemy, Armageddon) and Johan Reinholdz (Andromeda, Widow) don\u2019t do a bad job where it counts, though it explains why a lot of Moment is as generic as it is in places. Not a bad record whatsoever, one that I am enjoying, but still a disappointment. Here\u2019s hoping in a few years, when the band\u2019s new line-up is more established and ready to contribute together, that we will get a truly outstanding Dark Tranquillity album that lives up to the legacy.\n\nOriginally written for Pit of Plagues: https://pitofplagues.com/2020/11/22/dark-tranquillity-moment-review/\n",
        "\nOften viewed as a contradiction by many in the broader death metal fan base, melodic death metal has proven a stylistic niche with staying power. Though it can be more accurately understood as having developed out of the refinement of the old Florida death metal sound that occurred in the early 90s via the broader Swedish death metal scene, the prime movers would consist of a trio of bands that would later be dubbed the Gothenburg Three, namely At The Gates, In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. The mixture of older heavy metal influences and common practice melodic and harmonic schemes with several of the extreme metal stylistic tropes exhibited by all three of these bands would shape a broad movement of northern European bands well into the mid-2000s, though their individual prowess in studio output would not manifest equally, as In Flames\u2019 embracement of American hardcore influences and At The Gates\u2019 becoming defunct for more than a decade would leave Dark Tranquillity as the only stylistically consistent representative of the old guard.\n\nNaturally this long-running outfit has gone through its share of lineup changes and a gradual evolution of sound, but compared against much of the scene that they helped to pioneer, Dark Tranquillity is a shining example of stylistic orthodoxy and qualitative consistency. The past few years have seen a number of consequential contributors to the band\u2019s core sound exit the stage, with the particular case of co-founder and longtime lead guitarist Niklas Sundin being the most auspicious. Nevertheless, the release of their 12th studio LP Moment has not seen any decline in the quality of their songwriting craft, and a notably upping of the ante in the technical department with the acquisition of former Arch Enemy guitarist Christopher Amott (sometimes known as Amott The Younger given the famed six-string exploits of his old brother Michael in both Carcass and Arch Enemy). Almost equally as consequential as the aforementioned acquisition is that of Johan Reinholdz of Skyfire and Andromeda fame also handling guitar duties, further widening the possibilities within an otherwise by the numbers format.\n\nWhile one might guess that the new lineup of musicians to enter the fray would result in some sort of progressive-infused romp or a more thrashing, high impact take on the melodeath style, this album ultimately winds up towing the same stylistic line that has been this band\u2019s signature sound since the early 2000s. The most obvious comparison would be to that of 2007\u2019s Fiction, an album defined primarily by a dense keyboard atmosphere and semi-frequent employment of a lighter, crooning clean vocal performance out of front man Mikael Stanne, resulting in something that is somewhat comparable to the dreamy sound typical to certain Finnish bands like Insomnium and Omnium Gatherum. However, in contrast to said bands, this is not an extended series of epic length compositions or speed-infused anthems blurring the style\u2019s lines with power metal, but more so a compact and concise collection of somber anthems that place an emphasis on accessibility and familiarity, while putting some nice sugary lead guitar treats on the periphery when Amott and Reinholdz are given a solo slot.\n\nFor all of its predictability, this album delivers plenty of infectious anthems that would be sing-along fanfare were most of the world\u2019s population comprised of amateur death metal growlers. The groovy and spacey serenity of opening banger \u201cPhantom Days\u201d starts the sonic journey off on a decidedly strong note, featuring plenty of glistening melodic guitar hooks and a dense atmospheric keyboard backdrop. As things progress, the band\u2019s approach gets a little bit more aggressive with punchy anthems such as \u201cTransient\u201d and the more synthesizer-happy \u201cThe Dark Broken\u201d, eventually reaching a respectable roar on the quasi-thrashing cruisers \u201cIdentical To None\u201d and \u201cA Drawn Out Exit\u201d. It\u2019s tough to really pick a favorite from the pack, as the whole album flows consistency and even proves highly effective at drawing one\u2019s attention into its cold, melancholy little world when venturing into a sort of Gothic-tinged mode of balladry, such as heard on \u201cRemain In The Unknown\u201d and the more relaxed moments of the riff happy thrasher \u201cEgo Deception\u201d, each featuring prominent clean passages such by Stanne and offering up a stark contrast to the stormy, frostbitten segments surrounding them.\n\nIn the grand scheme of Dark Tranquillity\u2019s near 30 year career, this stands as one of the more polished yet also one of the more safe ventures to come out of their arsenal. It doesn\u2019t quite deliver the same level of lasting impact as Fiction, but it proves to be a slight step above most of what came between said album and the present. The contributions of both Amott and Reinholdz on the band\u2019s overall sound is consistently positive, but a tad understated, almost making the listener beg for either one of them to throw in a few technical guitar fills out of turn or getting a bit busier with their melodic hooks. Then again, the gradual way that each song manifests itself and lingers upon each idea is one of this album\u2019s greatest strengths, and the varied vocal performance combined with the chilling tone of the keyboard work does much to keep things interesting. With a greater amount of time and subsequent albums to further hone these two virtuoso players\u2019 contribution to the band\u2019s sound, a new classic to rival this band\u2019s seminal works could lie a couple years down the road.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nSkydancer is a moment in history. Every song feels like an arcane story being retold. It captured that sense of wonder as the early \u201890s was awash with ideas on the evolution of extreme metal. Dark Tranquillity relied on much of the same trademarks, but their brand of guitar tremolo, frenetic riffing, and beaming melancholic atmosphere put them on a different footing than almost any of their peers at the time. It\u2019s also one of the least death metal albums to come out of an era known for being the golden age of death metal. \n\nSkydancer\u2019s roots are in thrash and death (with some semblance of Swedish black metal), but what propels Dark Tranquillity here is melody influenced by the band\u2019s deep interest in classical music and traditional Swedish folk. However, their approach to writing was a bit convoluted. There\u2019s a disjointedness that turns what should be cohesive songs into sweeping compositions packed with overcompensated riffs, curious arrangement shifts, and other minor elements. All backed by production and (thankfully remastered) mastering that wasn\u2019t geared for metal. Instead of buzzsaws and crunch in the guitars it\u2019s a nebulous, raw clarity. It lacks power behind their music, restricting whatever goals they set out to achieve. This goes beyond just the guitars \u2013 it affects the entire experience by making everything sound weak and unrefined. On one hand they failed, but on the other they succeeded.\n\nDark Tranquillity\u2019s success comes after years of experimenting and developing their craft. Skydancer is not a beginning, but an early chapter after even earlier entries: Enfeebled Earth, Trail of Life Decayed, and A Moonclad Reflection. As much as the band was trying to figure out something new and be innovative every step of the way, they weren\u2019t aimless and incapable of writing good songs. There\u2019s a mystical liveliness to \u201cCrimson Winds\u201d and \u201cMy Faeryland Forgotten\u201d that feels evocative, with its forlorn tone trying to balance aggression and beauty through intertwining lead work, pummeling rhythms, and Frid\u00e9n\u2019s dry, light growls. \u201cA Bolt of Blazing Gold\u201d contains an acoustic build up and an easy pace full of pleasant melodies to make for a relaxing listen. Both the female singing and Stanne\u2019s clean vocals are a bit awkward but don\u2019t detract much overall (both are showcased heavily on the ballad \u201cThrough Ebony Archways\u201d). There\u2019s enough going on to keep the music from being too one-dimensional, but also so much that it becomes forgettable at times.\n\nThis album was a trial run of sorts to see what worked and what didn\u2019t. It took years to warm up to its charm, which doesn\u2019t make it very appealing from the onset (despite its fantastic cover art as a first impression). By 1993, Dark Tranquillity was still figuring out what they were trying to accomplish. Skydancer is a good album \u2013 one whose failings are in its technical faults, overambition and lack of purpose. There was an abundance of riffs and arrangements, especially this early in melodic death, to create and explore. It was new territory, something which the band was at the forefront of. But that didn\u2019t mean they struck gold on their first real effort. Skydancer was a stepping stone in an evolving subgenre. It was a work in progress stemming from years of ideas conceived out of brutality and nurtured into melody. Not to be a landmark for successors, but evidence of something larger than itself coming to fruition. It was the cultured beginnings of a young, eager band that now had something that, with spirited intent and definition, was truly melodic death metal.\n",
        "\nTastes change when you get older. In 1995 I liked white chocolate and Dark Tranquillity. I remember hearing \u201cPunish My Heaven\u201d on a cover CD for Terrorizer magazine. I was blown away by everything that was going on, all that audacious melody (but with harsh vocals making it sound 'edgy' enough for my teenage brain). I was already into At the Gates (particularly \"Terminal Spirit Disease\"), so Dark Tranquillity seemed like a logical step. I rushed out and bought \"The Gallery\" as soon as it was released. I loved it and played it constantly.\n\nMy taste back in 1995 was informed by the music I\u2019d heard up to that point. This was mainly thrash and death metal. I was a narrow-minded teenager and just wanted to hear distortion and growling. I didn't have much understanding of any music beyond metal. I had no appreciation of aesthetics and atmosphere. I wanted to build my CD collection with all the latest metal bands and their flashy tricks. Dark Tranquillity would fit the bill because they were extreme enough and had an interesting capacity for melody. In some respects, I was right, because \"The Gallery\" became the yardstick for the Gothenburg melodic death metal genre (which conquered the globe). \n\nNowadays I find this album unlistenable. Everything I loved about it back then (the melody, the rasping vocals, the clean production, the singalong sections, the pseudo-emotional parts) are the most grating, annoying things about it. I remember liking \"The Dividing Line\" (with its incredibly lightweight solo at 2:24). I remember singing along to the plodding title track (with woefully mismatched female vocals). I remember playing \"Lethe\" time and time again, indulging in its overwrought glory. I've not listened to this album for 20 years, but I can still remember quite a few riffs and lyrics. There are hooks here.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why I changed my opinion. First, I discovered music beyond metal. Second, I got into Iron Maiden. Back then I barely listened to Maiden because they weren't heavy enough for me. Now I can hear that nearly every Dark Tranquillity\u2019s trick comes from the Maiden handbook. Melody is only a small part of what makes Maiden great, they also have an incredible vocalist, several amazing songwriters and some epic concepts. Forcing Maiden-esque melodies into an 'extreme metal' framework makes little sense because that isn't what makes Maiden appealing. Records like \u201cStorm of the Light\u2019s Bane\u201d, \"Slaughter of the Soul\u201d (or even Desultory's \"Into Eternity\") get away with overt melody because they also retain some intensity. Dark Tranquillity only retain the melody.\n\nI would struggle to call \"The Gallery\" a 'bad' album. The musicianship is excellent, the bass sounds great, there are some amazing melodies (as you would expect). Dark Tranquillity put a lot of effort into this record. It is a genuine attempt to make music and I don't resent them for pulling the wool over my eyes. \u201cPunish My Heaven\u201d is still an impressive song after all these years, like it or not. The problem is that \"The Gallery\" lacks perspective. It is the musical equivalent of standing two inches in front of the Mona Lisa and expecting to see a masterpiece. Everything is too close, too present, too bright, too obvious. Just like white chocolate, this will make you sick if you consume too much of it. Unfortunately, 'too much' equates to about 30 seconds for me nowadays.\n",
        "\nFolks, I bought this album the day it came out back in 2013 and being a long-time Dark Tranquillity fan I thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. (with the exception of None Becoming, seriously fuck that song. It doesn\u2019t carry the benevolence and depth of Mundane and The Magic, or the ever wonder muse of Iridium.) Well, six years after realizing my place as a functioning adult diaper handling loads of metaphorical shit, my perspective on this album has changed.\n\nDark Tranquillity is a band that has always provided a different sound on each of their albums they have released. For the past few releases since Character (2005), the band has been following a similar melodic melancholy sound but with only minor changes on each album. Character had electronic influences, Fiction utilized a gothic rock ambience with layered keyboards and a pinch of black metal (a-la Inside The Particle Storm) while We are the Void was simply a bastard carbon-cloned successor of Fiction, albeit a bit more darker in tone on some songs. \n\nConstruct is a pair-bond of both Fiction and We are the Void with a smidge of influence from Projector. It features a mixture of black metal influences, melodic death metal riffs, and a hybrid of gothic/arena rock atmosphere mixed all in one. The vocalist Mikael Stanne is in his top performance here showing off his guttural growls and thought provoking lyrics on the human ego, not to mention his clean vocals are excellent as well. Would you say this sounds interesting on paper? It does, but on Construct not every song is a real stand out with this formula, the majority of the tracks don\u2019t have any moments where the music grabs your full attention but still provides an easy listen.\n\nThe black metal influence is there, sometimes it works, \u201cFor Broken Words\u201d and sometimes it does not, \u201cUniformity\u201d. The former features tremolo riffs to simulate the wall-of-sound effect while being driven by a heavy bass sound laden with groove-like riffing, top it off with Mikael Stanne growling his way through the dissonance, \u201cCommit to sacrifice!!\u201d It is very dynamic and interesting. The later mentioned shows again the wall-of-sound effect between the chorus, but has no depth, it is just there. If it were not for the clean singing this track would be a complete bore.\n\n\u201cWhat You Only Know\u201d is the live staple featuring mostly clean singing by Mr. Stanne. Strong, energetic, invoking great emotion, the choir effect from the keyboards are placed with great effect especially after the post chorus where the drums pick up the tempo, \u201cWHEN THE NIGHT IS LONG, AND THE WILL IS WEAK\u2026.\u201d You cannot really hear the guitars in this one though, the keyboards really overpower this song.\n\nThat being said, the rest of the music is very predictable melodic death metal with a modern production with some half-thrash/groove riffs thrown in. Predictable being not hearing anything surprising that makes the listener think, \u201cOH WOW!!! HOW!? WHAT!? NO WAY\u201d Seriously, go listen to, \u201cEndtime Hearts\u201d on this album then go listen to, \u201cCornered\u201d off of the Retrospect and Denial compilation. Endtime Hearts doesn\u2019t stray from the melodic death metal formula, it just follows a pattern with the guitars strumming, then the keyboards come in to produce a fill for the chorus to take place, rinse and repeat. This is the formula for most of the album. Cornered does have a pattern as well, but each set of riffs would always be a surprise, especially when the chorus would come around where each musician was performing their own piece that seemed incoherent, but shared a bond in the outcome.\n\nAll said and done if you are a Dark Tranquillity fan I recommend giving this a spin, just don\u2019t expect anything amazing. I purchased this album when it first came thinking this album was GREAT!!! Turns out I was so blinded by fandom that I couldn\u2019t see the overall quality of the music. This is Haven 2.0, catchy but doesn\u2019t really go anywhere.\n\nTop Cuts: For Broken Words What Only You KnowImmemorial (USA Digipak Bonus Track)\n",
        "\nDark Tranquility is one of the bands from which the Gothenburg melodic death metal sound originated. Across their long career they have not disappointed with any of their releases. Character is a personal favorite of mine and I think it includes some of their best work. This album is yet another solid release by this phenomenal band. The recording quality is great, all of the playing is insanely tight, and the album has very good cohesion between songs. Dark Tranquility is a band that has always managed to write an album that has an general theme or sound while still providing a great variety of tracks within that setting. This album I would say combines a classic heavy approach with a background atmospheric presence that gives it a huge sound.\n\nOverall Character is a more fast-paced album than most of their releases. The first half of the album features a lot of blast beats and quicker riffs and melodies. It then calms down and has more of an atmospheric sound during the closing tracks of the record. This record in particular emphasized a lot of the piano parts as well. Several songs such as Senses Tied, Lost to Apathy, and The Endless Feed feature some more prominent keyboard and synth riffs, all of which are totally killer. And there is no shortage of absolutely amazing guitar riffs and leads. Dark Tranquility has mastered the art of harmonizing just when necessary and the use of multiple guitar parts to flesh out the sound. With all of the instruments working in unison this album sounds absolutely massive playing through the right speakers.\n\nThere are also a couple of tracks where the band took a bit of a different approach, almost achieving a ballad-like sound on some songs. Am I One and My Negation are both much slower more melodic and deliberate sounding songs. The use of clean and distorted guitars in addition to more of the keyboards taking the lead makes these two very stand out songs on the album.\n\nCharacter is an incredibly diverse record. It features fast songs, slower melodic tracks, and some just classic kick-ass, heavy tracks with some unbelievable guitar riffs. Dark Tranquility achieves such a huge and entrancing sound but while maintaining some fairly simple song structures and parts. All of these musicians are extremely technically proficient and there is definitely some challenging playing on this album but even the more technical parts are still catchy and easy to listen to. If you are a metal head and looking for new material I cannot recommend enough any of this band's material.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity are one of my favorite bands for a multitude of reasons. I think one reason is because they seem to be able to experiment with other sounds without forgetting their roots. As one of the pioneers of the Gothernburg sound, along with In Flames and At The gates, they helped create the explosive sub-genre melodic death metal. We all know where In Flames ended up and At The Gates are still hanging on but it\u2019s Dark Tranquillity that remains on the top of the heap. The reason why is because they have a strong songwriting unit and even though they may stray away from what one might consider a true melodic death metal sound, they have a strength in being able to create catchy songs.\n\nWith 1999\u2019s Projector, vocalist Mikael Stanne began to experiment with clean vocals while the band added more keyboards to the songs to provide more atmosphere and melody. This seemed to be a temporary thing since Damage Done and it\u2019s flawless follow up, Character, were heavier with little to no clean vocals and the keys played less of a role. I still consider the latter to be a melodic death metal masterpiece. Then with We Are The Void it seemed like they were going back to that Projector era sound that seemed to push a lot of fans away. What were they thinking? With Atoma, it has become apparent what they were thinking. It took a few tries but it seems that they were able to mix the best of what they have done throughout their career into a sound to create an album of great songs.\n\nI think this album will still divide because it\u2019s not the return of Character, nor is it a complete transition to the Projector/Haven era. Instead it\u2019s a mix of of riffs, keys, clean and death metal vocals, and great soloing. I actually wish that they included more guitar solos because when they do add them they are well done and add another layer to the songs. The album opener, \u201cEncircled,\u201d is a prime example of how they mix great riffing with a strong keyboard atmosphere. There are no clean vocals here and it\u2019s possibly the heaviest song on the album. \u201cForward Momentum\u201d is another song that seems to have that \u201cFreeCard\u201d vibe. It has some nice riffs, a really nice solo and the cleaner parts are really well done. I think this song is the defining Dark Tranquillity sound for where they are in their career.\n\nWe Are the Void and it\u2019s follow up, Construct, were decent albums but were lacking a lot. I even defended the latter because it seemed apparent to me what the band was attempting, they just missed the mark a bit. Atoma is a much more solid album. Even the weakest songs on this album have enough substance to make them interesting. \u201cMerciless Fate\u201d is not a bad song, it just could have been much better if it were a bit more coherent. It has some great moments but seems to plod along in places. \u201cFaithless By Deafult\u201d is another song that does not stand up to the better moments on this album but it\u2019s still a good song.\n\nAt this point in their career, Dark Tranquillity have nothing to prove to anyone. They have their legions of fans for a reason. They were one of the trailblazers and they are still on top. These guys will continue to create great new music because it\u2019s who they are. Am I biased because I\u2019m a fan? Maybe, but great metal can not be denied.\n\n\nThe Elitist Metalhead\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve ignored Dark Tranquillity for the last 15 years. I have not listened to them since 1999\u2019s Projector album, which marked the first semblance of the shift in their sound away from the original Gothenberg melodic death metal they pioneered along with In Flames & At the Gates back in the early-90s. You remember this style, right? Aggressive, speeding riffs and drums, juxtaposed with well-timed melodic passages, all paved with harsh vocals that border on black metal shrieks. On Projector, things started to slow and become more accessible. Clean vocals, acoustic guitar passages and piano were added to the chaos. And while Projector was by no means a bad album, this period found Dark Tranquillity surrounded by a myriad of imitators, which by association, watered-down the genre and led to listener fatigue due to more of the same. Thus my diversion from this band and the genre as a whole. \n\nSo, seven albums later in 2016 has anything changed? Yes, but not for the better. Only 4 songs into the album, a distinct formula emerges. Soft keyboard intro followed by a heavy guitar riff with harsh vocals, then a bridge with that main riff slowed down and overlaid with the soft melody. Repeat for 4 minutes each song. It\u2019s almost like they are trying to make a synth-wave/metal mashup but without any good synth-wave. A few guitar riffs here and there are actually pretty good (see \u201cForward Momentum,\u201d) but the arrangements of the songs give them little impact. A lyric in \u201cFaithless by Default\u201d goes \u201cwe\u2019ve lost our way,\u201d and I\u2019m sitting here like, \u201c\u2026and knowing is half the battle.\u201d \n\nI would think a more accessible hard rock sound & production as found on this album would warrant more clean-singing, like it does on the title track. However, many songs lean heavily on the harsh growls. Dark Tranquillity seem to be trying to be more accessible but still extreme at the same time. Maybe I\u2019m just too far removed from this style of music, but I don\u2019t understand why this blend of sounds is pleasing. I suppose it must be for quite a few people since this band still exists and continues to be a live draw, but I just cannot get excited about this album. \n\nToward the end of Atoma is a track named \u201cMerciless Fate.\u201d Don\u2019t get excited. It sound nothing like Merciless or Mercyful Fate. Just more of the same on this twelve track merry-go-round of \u2018meh.\u2019 Lyrics from the last track actually sum up the album better than I can in this review:\n\nHere we are doing nothing\nBeing nothing\nWe are wasting away\n\nOriginally posted on http://www.moshpitnation.com/\n",
        "\nAs a longtime Dark Tranquillity fan, I can\u2019t help but be concerned with the future of this once amazing band. Atoma is the eleventh studio album of the Swedish melodeath masters and even though the band does not seem to be getting out of shape, this new full-length just looks like \u201cmore of the same\u201d. I mean, the album was not intended to be a continuation of Construct, but as Construct it lacks a lot of musical elements that were the trademark of the band\u2019s previous releases. Atoma is way too soft. The riffs are too soft. Vocals are boring. Lyrics are just okay. This is something unacceptable for a band that helped to create melodic death metal.\n\nFirst of all, the presence of keyboards and synthesizers are a constant in Atoma. It wouldn't be a bad thing if they were accompanied by the amazing guitar riffs and melodies that Sundin and Cia have always been able to create, but after several spins on this album, riffs and melodies just seem to be forgettable. The synthesizers alone give a goth-like vibe to the songs that makes them sound like some kind of post-dream pop metal. This album really lacks some amazing guitar melodies that were the strong point of all of the band\u2019s most successful albums. \n\nAtoma also lacks aggressiveness. It is still a melodic death metal album, but it does not have the fury or even the pace of a death metal album. Some tracks like \u201cThe Pitiless\u201d, \u201cWhen The World Screams\u201d and \u201cEncircled\u201d still have that energy and atmosphere which resemble Character or Damage Done (and they are the highlights of the album), but the other ones are just average melodic death metal. Also, Stanne\u2019s clean vocals were never so unnecessary. They are even annoying. Dark Tranquillity made the risky decision to put clean vocals already in the first tracks and simply made them the down point of the album. If they had just skipped the clean vocals, this album would be much more enjoyable as a whole.\n\nNevertheless, Atoma is not a bad album at all. For a band that\u2019s been almost 30 years on the road, they still have the same heart and passion for composing and playing like in the glorious old days, but this album sounds too soft for what we're used to hearing from these guys. Their songwriting is still amazing, but from the beginning to the end, Atoma simply looks like a continuation of Construct, only a little more fast and better produced. A good choice for new fans, not so much for the old fans.\n\nOriginally written for http://naturezadocaos.blogspot.com.br\n",
        "\nHaven, Dark Tranquillity's fifth album, continues in much of the same fashion as its predecessor, Projector, and fits in seamlessly with the surrounding catalog, being slow and midpaced much of the duration, like Projector, but also with the addition of keyboardist Martin Branstrom, which proved to be a turning point in Dark Tranquillity's career. And with such importance surrounding Haven, you'd think that it was a great release. Alas, it is not. \n\nAs the review title (and song title from this album) hinted at, this is one helluva monotonous album. The midpaced to slow tempo, Stanne's grumpy growl, the general sense of helplessness and sorrow permeating this album... it all becomes white noise by the time Feast of Burden is over. The riffs all start sounding the same, and the lack of variety slowly strangles this album. Stanne's gifted clean voice finally makes an appearance over the morass of the rest of the album, but by then it's far too little, and far too late. The guitars pretty much chug most of the time, with a few songs like Feast of Burden grabbing their share of riffs, but I still can't run away from the conclusion that one guitarist could accomplish more than what Dark Tranquillity's guitarists have put forth on Haven. Too many power chords, too much lazy chugging. Too often the keyboards pretty much carry the melody, which results in a neutered sound as a result. I would say that the only strength of Haven is that one can wallow in depression quite nicely to this collection of downtempo moody half-ballads, but Haven comes off as somewhat too mundane for even that. It's never terribly bad, but it's never really great either.\n\nA good way of thinking of this album is to imagine taking the songs To a Bitter Halt and Auctioned from the last album, stripping most of the clean vocals from the songs, and making a whole album out of just that aesthetic. There's no variation on tempo, and many songs aren't even slow enough for a proper depressive feel. I suspect that condensing this album into 4 killer songs would have made for a fantastic EP, but that's not what I'm reviewing. I'm reviewing a full length album with way too much filler, way too monotonous drumming, and way not enough riffs. The band would eventually find their purpose again, but in the mean while Haven will have to be content being Projector's ugly younger sibling.\n",
        "\nI have listened to several Dark Tranquillity records and I have seen them in concert twice with other more interesting bands so far and my impression was that the band almost always sounds the same. The Gothenburg melodic death metal pioneers offer numerous mid-tempo or moderately up-tempo tracks songs around four minutes dominated by melancholic melodies and singer Mikael Stanne\u2019s unusually hoarse and almost whispered growls with occasional brooding clean vocal parts. The only release I have listened to so far that was a little bit more ambitious, eclectic and intense was the band\u2019s debut Skydancer twenty-three years ago with a certain Anders Frid\u00e9n on vocals. It\u2019s not a surprise that I have seen Dark Tranquillity playing in small metal pubs with a few hundred fans while In Flames still fills arenas with several thousands of supporters.\n\nWhile Dark Tranquillity sticks to its same old trademarks on the new output \u2018\u2019Atoma\u2019\u2019, this release is a definite improvement over the last few studio efforts and a true career highlight. Especially the longing clean vocals are executed very well and used more dominantly. They give several tracks a depressive alternative rock or even gothic rock touch that isn\u2019t a far call from bands such as Katatonia or even Placebo. The clean vocals work quite well in contrast to the more desperate and sluggish growls in the numbing \u2018\u2019Atoma\u2019\u2019 or the melodic \u2018\u2019Forward Momentum\u2019\u2019 that evoke a depressive, longing and mysterious atmosphere that dominates the entire album.\n\nThere are three tunes that manage to stick out a little bit on the regular version of this release. The opener \u2018\u2019Encircled\u2019\u2019 has more urgency in its angry and fast verses while the melodies in the chorus are epic and sluggish and almost recalling Amorphis. \u2018\u2019Force of Hand\u2019\u2019 is rather the opposite and has a rather slow, numbing and hypnotizing touch supported by carefully employed cold electronic influences. This track reminds me a little bit of what In Flames did twelve years earlier on their album Soundtrack to Your Escape. Another highlight is the emotional and melodic \u2018\u2019Clearing Skies\u2019\u2019 that sounds almost hopeful compared to the rest of the album despite the rather dark lyrics. The dreamy, mysterious and sluggish instrumental middle part fits perfectly.\n\nThe biggest surprise comes along with the bonus tracks on a separate disc. These songs don\u2019t feature any melodic death metal elements and offer haunting and profound depressive rock instead. These slow tracks are entirely dominated by airy electronic sounds and fragile clean vocals. This style reminds me of the more sluggish tunes of German gothic metal institution Crematory minus the growls. I can understand why the band put these tracks on a different disc because these tracks almost sound as if they had been recorded by a different group but I believe that these two tracks could have added some diversity to the album if they had been at different spots in between the twelve regular tracks. Melodic death metal purists will despise these two songs but those who have a weakness for depressive alternative or gothic rock will see these two tunes as highlights of the album. \n\nIn the end, Dark Tranquillity\u2019s new record is much better than I would have expected. It has a more gripping atmosphere than the predecessors and it\u2019s easier to distinguish several tracks on this output thanks to small but efficient differences. My personal highlights are the two bonus tracks \u2018\u2019The Absolute\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Time Out of Place\u2019\u2019 where the veterans offer something haunting, intense and original that some fans will adore while others might find it forgettable. If I had to buy another album besides the outstanding debut record Skydancer, I would definitely go for this one here.\n",
        "\nA fair bit of criticism has been levied against Dark Tranquillity lately, largely due to the cyclical, monotone repetition that has defined their sound ever since Character gloriously raised the bar initially set by Damage Done. The lame attempt at going halfway back to the Projector-era on Construct exposed the band in ways not seen before, taking this half-baked temperament to a new level of pointlessness by committing a grievous artistic sin on par with Children of Bodom's Blooddrunk. Three years later, and right on schedule, Atoma brings us the newest cadre of repackaged odes to a sound perfected over a decade ago. At this point, the best we can hope for is a solid spiritual successor to Character or maybe Fiction. To be frank, that is what we get here more or less, which inherently makes this album superior to Construct.\n\nAtoma feels much more competent than its direct predecessor, and even trumps We Are the Void at points due to the more fleshed-out songwriting and the fact that the band has sifted out virtually all trace of extraneous fluff. One could argue that the material is wholly lacking in soul, and despite the band's wise inclusion of Stanne's brooding, morose cleans at more than one juncture, I can certainly comprehend this criticism. That said, I'm not expecting nor pining for Dark Tranquillity to reinvent the wheel, merely deliver the emotive, poignant melodic death that they have more or less mastered at this point. It feels more sincere than At the Gates latest cash grab and the less said about In Flames' current state of affairs, the better. The isolation, depression and emptiness evoked by the graceful synths and tortured vocals is retained and present in spades. Songs like \"Neutrality\" feel like decent followups to the straight-laced bangers of earlier albums like \"Lost to Apathy\" and \"Focus Shift.\" On that same note, however, Stanne has begun recycling vocal lines/cadences to the point of basically plagiarising his old self. The inclusion of the cleans was great, but he needs to work on the lyrics more.\n\nThe surging leads contrast and gestate well within the framework set by Sundin's distinct rhythm constructions. The band still falls prey to stock melodeath riffs that just sort of sputter along in the background, and the mix seems to favor the bass and drums more than the guitars as a whole, lending to an unusual sonic palette for Dark Tranquillity. The song structures are more of the same, and invite a fair bit of nuance, which is partially squandered by the dialed-back synths. The band needs more songs like \"Terminus (Where Death Is Most Alive),\" instead of repeatedly deferring to the grand piano. In isolation, this style works much like it did on earlier songs like \"Her Silent Language,\" but more upfront synths would be appreciated. The production fits these guys' dense, nihilistic volition quite well, feeling darker but not in a forced way like Construct did. This is best felt on the dynamic \"The Pitiless.\"\n\nObviously, Atoma won't change many a mind out there. Haters will continue to rag on the band for leeching off of past glories, but at least this time it feels like they are aiming for a period that most people remember most fondly. To those intentionally unfamiliar with the band and melodeath in general, all of this is going to sound more or less the same, but those of us who remember Character as the near-masterpiece and watershed moment that triggered a riptide in the melodeath scene pursuant to summoning many imitators, this album feels more than listenable. It adds a handful of good tracks (and a few great) to keep the tour bus wheels rolling and the band motivated enough to continue existing and releasing quality material. You know what, I'm just fine with that.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity are basically the stalwarts of melodic death metal, being the oldest and longest lived of any bands in the genre, as well as remaining in the confines of their style unlike some of their fellow countrymen. It can also be argued that they're probably the most consistent band of their type too, having never put out a stinker in all their years in the business. However in this particular case that isn't a good thing. For my money, I'd argue that DT have never really put out a good album (outside of Character, which honestly seems like a fluke), with every single one suffering from pretty much the same problem: They're boring. In later cases this is down to writing songs that dither about without integrating any memorable hooks or leads, or indeed not performing with any real energy, but on earlier efforts like this the issue is down to something far more frustrating.\n\nThis album is archetypal melodic death metal, and it basically set the template for a lot of the more orthodox bands in the style that would come about later. It's full of, and I mean *full of* melodic leads. Riffs of the more normal death, thrash or even groove metal persuasion are virtually nowhere to be found, literally all the guitar work on this album is a lead, and there isn't a moment on this album that isn't absolutely sugar coated in a melodic lead of some kind. The guitars have almost no distortion on them at all (much like a lead tone, unsurprisingly) and the bass reminds me a lot of what Steve Harris would do, given that it complements the guitars very well with its rather notable plugging. It's easily the best thing about this album, if only because it reminds me of Maiden so much. \n\nObviously saying that this is exactly like Iron Maiden isn't really correct. There's the obvious difference of Mikael Stanne's growls, which are typical melodeath vocals in that they're like less abrasive and more intelligible death growls. As far as the style goes he's worlds above Anders Frid\u00e9n, being entirely serviceable if perhaps a little unremarkable compared to what Tomas Lindberg could do around this time. That said however, the comparison to Maiden is, to be blunt, a massive insult to Iron Maiden. That band had two things Dark Tranquillity completely fails at - the first of which is restraint. As stated, Dark Tranquillity completely let loose on the melody here with no let up and it becomes unbelievably tiresome after approximately two minutes into 'Punish My Heaven', with its constant noodling that sounds nice at first, but simply grates. The problem is that there's a melody every 5 seconds, since a more simplified album like The Jester Race is notably more effective despite being just as melodic. That album works much more effectively because it develops one or two melodies over the course of a song, making for a more flowing, measured and coherent listening experience. Here, the guitarists simply noodle away or throw every idea they can at you in order to impress and dazzle in a flurry of sugary technicality, but it simply fails.\n\nThere's also a second, more serious problem here, which largely stems from the first. While the band had the right idea on this album, that being throwing in melodic hooks into the songs to keep them memorable, they overdo it so much that rather than being a recurring motif in a song they are the body of the song. This has the added effect of a dearth in memorable riffing as it is overtaken by the lead work. This is a problem in and of itself because the guitars are noodling constantly, rather than playing something memorable. Hence the songs tend to meander and lose focus and tend not to be very memorable. In fact, it's normally the bass that prevents the songs from devolving into a blur when trying to recall them. And perhaps worst of all, the songs themselves are totally flat and one-dimensional. There aren't really any climaxes or overtly emotional moments (apart from some pretty poor female warbling at times, along with Stanne's decent cleans), there's very little in the way of an atmosphere; it almost sounds as if the songs were hastily assembled to be vehicles for some soloing. Very few memorable ideas are offered up by a song during its running time, forcing one to focus intently on largely shallow and irritating music.\n\nWhat makes this technical failure so frustrating is that everyone here is clearly talented. The guitarists, while not very good at reining it in or writing, can clearly play their instruments well, the bass is great, Mikael is a solid vocalist and the drummer is good as well. It's just that the guitarists went so overboard with their Iron Maiden worship as to forget about writing something memorable and with adequate riffs. I also have another minor quibble - there isn't really that much aggression to this album at all. The guitars are very sugar-coated in tone and substance, with only a modicum of aggression coming from the vocals. Otherwise the whole album is overblown, melodramatic and shallow, as well as being like a bad parody of Iron Maiden musically with decent growls on top.\n",
        "\nBefore the glut of Gothenburg wannabes, before the \"melodicore\" bastardization, before the captains of stylistic industry turning high tail and selling out, there was \"Skydancer\". Before this little doozy came at us, there was really no concept of \"melodic death metal\". There was just \"death metal\", and despite its appeal it wasn't for everyone. It was even considered taboo in certain Nordic circles, where bands and musicians found shadow-dwelling corpse-painters sending death threats for even bothering to exist (just ask Euronymous back in the day...). But then, out of the blue, a group of Swedes decided to take the deathly approach, add in Maiden-esque guitar harmonies and folk melodies and, before they knew it, a new branch in the heavy metal tree was slowly growing...\n\nAs this was one of the first melodeath albums to come out, one can tell that both the album itself AND the style were works in progress. You could detect some serious black metal influence with this (the drumming, trem. picking, vocal style, atmosphere) versus a more legit death feel, which is rather understandable given the musical climate at the time in ye ol' Scandinavia. But that actually works well in \"Skydancer's\" favor, where the inherent melodies are more natural and cold in scope. The whole of the album has the ambient feel of a quick jaunt through a wintry wood sans the snow; bleak, dark, chilly and beautiful in its savagery and black cloud overhanging, where the band, as a whole, go about their respective instrumental wares like they were all aflame, with frantic performances and an almost inhuman level of tightness given how wild abandon it all is, as if not playing this fast and insane would lead to their demise. \"Spirited\" only gets halfway there as a description, and the more into it the listener gets the more tired they'd be trying to keep up. This is easily the musical equivalent of running a marathon, but appreciating every exhausting step until it all comes to a halt and you collapse under the weight of your fatigued legs. It may seem way too much to handle at first, but the pay-off is worth it. But it's not all mind-blowing speed; there are slower, more gentler moments and songs that cut through the hurricane of notes that, in their own right, are just as enjoyable, if a touch rough around the edges and almost sounding like restraints holding the immediacy at bay. These end up adding the most amount of atmosphere to the album, where one could sit a spell beside a deep forest bonfire to warm their bones for a little while before the chase resumes. \n\nOn a musical level, I cannot deny the sheer amount of inspiration that flowed from the band at this point in their career. Guitars (electric and acoustic) and bass stay in the respective key but forge paths all their own and only rarely coming together, more often playing off one another rather than with each other. Said guitar parts don't really fall into the power chord trappings for the most part and instead come at the listener from more than eight different directions, literally flying to and fro at high rapidity sometimes too fast to be noticed at first listen, and common song structures were cast asunder in the name of seeing just how much the listener can take in terms of instrumental bludgeoning and spitfire vocal calisthenics of myth and nature helped cultivate that 'forementioned atmosphere. I really couldn't keep count with how many harmonics and riffs just burst from each track after the seventh or so, only to find that I was merely halfway through a track, and each of those successive ideas sounded as grandiose as the ones preceding and following. Goodness me, it was almost too much to handle... But with all that said, the material as a whole doesn't really come off as cohesive compositions and more like off-the-cuff jam sessions the band threw together a day or so prior to recording. In a way it's grand in that nothing is forced or phoned-in; the level of energy in the performance itself speaks higher volumes than the material at hand, but the lack of serious cohesion and riffafterriffafterriffaterriff! arrangement schemes could very well lose the listener and thereby fade into the background. That's not what the work of legends is supposed to do, by gum!\n\nAll in all \"Skydancer\" was choking on potential and an influential nature, but it really felt like it was released before it was ready. Maybe an extra year or two on the burner could have done some real good, but I guess being able to essentially birth a sub-genre single-handedly is worth it in the end...\n",
        "\nI will be honest with you. For me bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquility may have never existed. I simply do not care about most of their albums, Dark Tranquility especially, whose very softened sound with weak vocals and boring pop metal music makes me sleepy and sick. I don\u2019t give a shit if someone calls it melodic death metal, because for me there\u2019s no death metal in their music at all, I also don\u2019t care if they are popular\u2026 Dark Tranquility means zero to me. Recently though I decided to buy this vinyl compilation titled \u201cYesterworlds\u201d, released by Floga Records, only because it contains very early Dark Tranquility recordings and I remember that years ago I used to like their 7\u201dEP. If it wasn\u2019t for this EP, then I would probably never bother to check \u201cYesterworlds\u201d. And I must say that I surely do not regret getting this LP. It is quite cool, well done compilation, with some good songs and surely I can say that it is the only release from the vast discography of the band, which for me is worthy to have.\n\nAnd first I must say that Floga did awesome job, when released this LP. A very nice shiny gatefold cover (I like that it is all white with golden print, it looks awesome). Inside of the gatefold there\u2019s a huge archival photo of the band, while the record is housed in additional inlay. On top of that, the whole comes with eight pages 7\u201dsize booklet, with original graphics, photos, liner notes and all lyrics (which are damn long!). Yes, very good job.\n\n\u201cYesterworlds\u201d contains \u201cTrail of Life Decayed\u201d demo 1991, \u201cA Moonclad Reflection\u201d EP 1992, \u201cPromo 1994\u201d and one song from a rare compilation (1994). Musically most of this stuff is way different to the pop metal, which Dark Tranquility is so famous for. It is way harsher, more aggressive, quite technical death metal, with some melodic accents and dark atmosphere, which will surely remind you early At the Gates first of all. Take \u201cTrail of Life Decayed\u201d first and foremost. It is not my favourite demo, to be honest, but it is all right, I guess. I am quite surprised that a very young band in 1991 managed to get such a good sound quality on their first studio recording (surely they sounded way better than such Crypt of Kerberos or Afflicted). The music is rather weird and not so easy to describe. It has some small melodic stuff like the excellent finishing part of \u201cVoid of Tranquility \u201c, but at the same time it is really raw and basic, with some frequent tempo changes, even quite fast playing in places (like the beginning of \u201cBeyond Enlightement\u201d and \u201cVernal Awakening\u201d). The vocals are screaming maybe not as much as Tompa usually does, but are in similar harsh, screaming style, not growling. It may be a severe recording, but I can assure you I like it more than any full length albums Dark Tranquility ever did.\n\n\u201cA Moonclad Reflection\u201d EP on the other hand already sounds more mature, it is slower, more atmospheric, more melodic. The guitar playing is more harmonious, the band uses some acoustic guitars, etc, so the progression is very obvious. And certainly this is my favourite recording in the entire Dark Tranquility discography. \u201cYesterworld\u201d is simply amazing song, love how it begins and some parts later are also great. It\u2019s very memorable, great quality melodic dark death metal. For me sometimes it\u2019s almost close to some melodic black metal bands like Naglfar or Dissection, mainly because the vocals of Anders Frid\u00e9n were again screaming and harsh. So, the end result is quite obscure, for my pleasure! Mind that both songs from \u201cA Moonclad Reflection\u201d are really long (almost eight minutes long each), so maybe this is why the whole material is not so easy to dig and requires some more listens. The remaining songs on the LP are from \u201cPromo 1994\u201d and well\u2026 They are good, all appear I think also on \u201cThe Gallery\u201d album, but they already are a bit over the edge for me. I can probably listen to them with no problem, but also with no excitement at all. Just typically boring melodic \u201cdeath\u201d (hmm) metal with bad vocals (sorry but I never liked the vocals of Mikael Stanne!); take the song \u201cThe Gallery\u201d \u2013 fuck, I am yawning already after a minute and the clean vocals in it are simply shit! So\u2026 I rather play the demo and EP again!\n\nSo, to conclude\u2026 for sure \u201cYesterworlds\u201d is a great compilation for the fans of Dark Tranquility and Floga did great job, when releasing this vinyl. Musically it is OK, but as mentioned already, I only like the demo and EP, everything after that is boring for me (\u201cSkydancer\u201d still being OK, but from \u201cThe Gallery\u201d further on the band can be flushed in the toilet for me!). So\u2026 I like half of this LP, so I give a mediocre plus final rate.\n\nFinal rate: 69/100\n",
        "\n\u201cIn the paleness of a less than life\nFrom a corner watching old paint dry\nNever once a break\nInto the self again\nAn endeavour that will flat our fail\nWhat maturity comes to end\nNever one to face\n\u2026 Another beat undone\u201d\n\nTaken out of context, this set of lyrics from \u201cNot Built to last\u201d out of \u201cHaven\u201d set the tone for what you might be listening when confronted with Dark Tranquillity\u2019s new album, \u201cConstruct\u201d. To keep on going in such a steady and successful career can be considered somewhat similar to a long-term relationship. A marriage of minds, to put it in a cornier way. However, every relationship reaches several pressure points which act as warnings that something just might not be working really well and needs to be rethought in order to avert a future crisis. This is it for these guys. A sign that the tried-and-true tricks are wearing old, the clock\u2019s ticking and maybe, just maybe the post \u201cDamage Done\u201d sound has ran its course and they cannot realise it.\n\n\u201cConstruct\u201d represents something my dumb fan mind thought would never happen, and my realistic side only saw it coming somewhere in the next 5-10 years: Dark Tranquillity are finally going through the motions. Almost everything here sounds like father time got them by the balls and they had no choice but to recycle ideas that are done for, so all songs are made of obligatory DT staples, only devoid of deeper meaning and feeling rushed.\n\nOh, yes. There are the mandatory fast songs (although no straight up death metal is to be found for good measure) and not of them ever comes close to reaching the heights of \u201cThe New Build\u201d or even \u201cTerminus\u201d. Sure, it\u2019s all damn professional, but my god, give me something to bite here. No underlying concept to be appreciated by the MAWDURRN production, not a lot of energy left in Jivarp, very few attention-grabbing guitars riffs, only dry, calculated professionalism and technicality. Guys, we know you can play, but please, get our heartstrings going, for god\u2019s sake.\n\nThe problem is, they seem incapable of working in tandem as a group of five good musicians, as the songs in which Jivarp can breathe feature dull guitar lines, and in the ripping, get-the\u2013fuck-out-of-my-face tune (\u201cApathetic\u201d), Brandstrom is nowhere to be heard. He, however, gets the spotlight in \u201cNone Becoming\u201d... where the rest of the band, except for the drums, stagger behind him at a loss about what to do. Mikael chimes in, does his stuff, and leaves. Rinse, repeat.\n\nSpeaking of it, the sole element that is constantly aware of how good it is and unwilling to drop the ball is, fortunately, the vocalist. Thankfully Mikael recovered from the lacklustre performance from the previous album to yet again deliver the goods, both with his roars and by being one of the most amazing lyricists in metal today. Also, to notice how the man has evolved in his clean singing is marvellous. That is, hands down, the only comparison this album can draw to \u201cProjector\u201d and sometimes it sounds even better than the 1999 release as Stanne grows ever confident of the amazing tone he has.\n\nNow let me tell you why the whole \u201cProjector\u201d thing is laughable, sad and a flat out lie at the same time. What that album lacked in raw intensity, it more than made up for it be being delightfully interesting. All songs were unexpected, strange little pieces of music; it was the sound of a band truly experimenting and HAVING A BLAST WITH IT. As you listened, you couldn\u2019t help but cackle like a child as you experienced the same thing these dudes probably did while writing the songs, which was \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the next 20 seconds will take us, but we sure as hell ain\u2019t afraid, so come along!\u201d\n\nBrothersister, I double fucking dare you to find something in here that conjures up the same feeling within your gut. Five seconds in \u201cEndtime Hearts\u201d and \u201cWeight of the end\u201d and I knew what they were up to. If anything, \u201cConstruct\u201d sounds like a gloomier and less shallow \u201cHaven\u201d and that\u2019s it.\n\nThere are three songs here that accomplished the strangely difficult task of going somewhere, managing to insert just a modicum of intrigue and energy into this journey, and they are \u201cApathetic\u201d, \u201cState of Trust\u201d and \u201cThe Silence in Between\u201d. The first one\u2019s a fast and dynamic piece that would have found a nice, cosy place to rest among the less bludgeoning songs in \u201cCharacter\u201d; the second shines with one of Mikael\u2019s all-time best clean vocal performances leading up a rocking, emotional tune that hearkens to the most memorable moments in \u201cHaven\u201d, and the third sees Sundin and Henriksson waking up from their self-imposed slumber to give us an eclectic performance that is mostly infused with simple rock music, but also calls upon other influences to keep the experience diverse with fiery, short staccato bursts allied with DT\u2019s recognisable creative use of string skipping and a great tremolo picked bridge.\n\nHowever, the others like \u201cThe Science of Noise\u201d and \u201cWeight of the End\u201d take turns suffering from bursts of ADHD as they fling in and out of intensity, sound like caffeinated, boring Katatonia b-sides (\u201cFor Broken Words\u201d), drone on and on until being saved by a catchy chorus (\u201cUniformity\u201d) or self-destruct into sheer nothingness like the bonus tracks. Seriously, these Swedes were never known for crafting amazing bonus songs, but what the hell is this? \u201cImmemorial\u201d feels like it desperately wants to explode into a sprawling, melodic monster like \u201cThe Lesser Faith\u201d but the band keeps it leashed and fed with sleeping pills, as \u201cPhoton Dreams\u201d gets a prize for being the most useless and uneventful song Dark Tranquillity has ever written in more than 20 years of career. No joking. \u201cArchetype\u201d at least had the decency of giving me a good laugh, but this? Please.\n\nThere\u2019s no need for another \u201cDamage Done\u201d, but running a formula to the ground is the death of an inspired musician. Understand that, despite my rating, this is not a truly bad album, since I still firmly believe Dark Tranquillity is one of the few modern metal bands incapable of phoning it in by writing an analogue to \u201cSoundtrack to Your Escape\u201d. Had it been released by ANY other band (especially by groups that have been churning bad music for the past 15 years, like In Flames) I would\u2019ve given it a solid 60. It\u2019s well played and well sung, but reeks of fatigue and old ideas. Time has come to reinvent yourselves again, my friends.\n",
        "\nThis album is one part Gothenburg classic and two parts an ADHD sufferer\u2019s wet dream. There\u2019s so much stuff going on Dark Tranquillity\u2019s sophomore effort that it could soothe the brains of your young kids for a whole month nonstop or maybe turn them into those hyperventilating freaks from 2007\u2019s reimagining of I Am Legend. Better produced and less aimlessly chaotic than \u201cSkydancer\u201d, \u201cThe Gallery\u201d tears its straightjacket and takes you into a hurricane of hyperactive, vaguely baroque lead guitars (same feeling that made In Flames\u2019 \u201cSubterranean\u201d a winner), Anders Jivarp accidentally replacing his drummer\u2019s seat with an electric chair and a bassist that should\u2019ve played in every other melodeath group. Songs end abruptly as if the band grew tired of it and wanted to immediately try the next batch of influences, few ideas and segments take hold for much more than 10 seconds and the album revels in the act of being loony and scandalous. Like it or not, the entertainment value is palpable.\n\nFormerly of In Flames and switching places with Anders Friden in what was probably Jesper Stromblad\u2019s weirdest career decision in life, Mikael Stanne makes his first impression on a DT record with the utmost lunacy and reckless abandon. Yelling from the top of his lungs whilst sounding playfully unhealthy just like Jonas Renkse on \u201cDance of December Souls\u201d, the man was the definition of \u201call over the place\u201d and did not give a shit, as any self-respecting early Gothenburg singer like Lindberg or even Friden himself used to do.\n\nAlso, Stanne shows us firsthand the only element that has remained excellent or at least otherwise unaltered in band\u2019s two decade career; the lyrics. An inspiration for many (myself proudly included) metal lyricists, Mikael (and Niklas, occasionally) weaves us webs of shrouded diatribes about topics both mundane and magical (pun intended) with equal quality, telling stories instead of opening a thesaurus and churning out complicated shit just for the sake of it. Take \u201cEdenspring\u201d as an example. A favourite of mine, the song is about nothing more than binge drinking and the effects of being shitfaced, but you\u2019d be hard pressed to find many other metal musicians who write about such common stuff with this level of poetic flair and taste. I tend to make a huge deal of it because heavy metal is a music genre full of extremely accomplished artists who mostly \u2013 and unfortunately- don\u2019t seem to give much attention to what they\u2019re saying in detriment to what they\u2019re playing, which is quite sad because the process of writing music meant to be sung should inherently involve a relationship between both.\n\nBack to the songs! \u201cPunish My Heaven\u201d and \u201cEdenspring\u201d, still live staples to this day, project DT\u2019s gleeful lack of restraint and youthful vigor like it was going out of fashion, as \u201cThe Dividing Line\u201d features sweet guitar eclecticism, stirring things up with a simple groove phrase, then a very welcome traditional riff and ghostly tremolo lines that would not sound out of place on their following record, not to mention the tasteful leads. \u201cThe one Brooding Warning\u201d and \u201cMidway through Infinity\u201d are an exercise in theatrical Gothenburg that keeps on boiling and raging around dynamic song structures as Stanne yelps and gnarls his way like a rabid dog pursuing an out of control car.\n\nWhat\u2019s so great about this is how they didn\u2019t give up the franticness of \u201cSkydancer\u201d, but did their homework of making it less erratic. Instead of catapulting two hundred ideas in your face at breakneck speed and calling it a day, they\u2019ll ease on the pace, let the riffs sink in just a tad longer and, in hopes of enthralling you, make the wise choice of leaving the cornier stuff at the album\u2019s tail end. Oh, believe me. This is going to get corny, and DT\u2019s willingness to dive headfirst into it can be seen as questionable albeit endearing. Remember, those were five young guys who didn\u2019t care and just wanted to show their music to the world, and excessive seriousness in a subgenre based around the thought of a less caustic death metal making sweet love to bastardized Iron Maiden riffs would be kind of silly. Sure, it can be pulled off (check out Garden of Shadows, or even this very same band when their ideas matured), but a little bit of ingenuity and inventiveness are the bread and butter of any good musician.\n\nThat being said, the middle part of \u201cLethe\u201d takes the cake as the funniest segment in here and a suitable Dani Filth favourite in his wine and gaaaawthic vampire literature afternoons. Man, this shit is so cheesy I can\u2019t help but love every second of it. Check out those over the top lyrics and vocal acrobatics, tell me you can\u2019t dig it and I\u2019ll deem you a joyless piece of wood for the rest of my days. \u201cMine is the Grandeur...\u201d is the obligatory acoustic interlude, but this time you\u2019re in for a sweet serving of flamenco guitars and orchestral drums. To do what has been done before, but with a twist of strangeness. That\u2019s where Dark Tranquillity shines.\n\nThe only songs that seem lost are \u201cSilence, and the Firmament Withdrew\u201d, a cute but slow number sandwiched between two monstrous tracks (thus rendered forgettable), the title track, and album closer \u201c... Of Melancholy Burning\u201d which attempt to summarize all we\u2019ve been listening to but can\u2019t quite circumnavigate certain pacing issues despite warbling yet surprisingly solid vocal cameos by Eva-Marie Larsson.\n\nWriting a worthwhile second album after a promising debut is no work for slouches. To take the foundations of what created your musical identity and fearlessly building upon them is even harder, and DT has broken the code for it. If you can stomach its drawbacks and unapologetic sprawling nature, you\u2019ll find out \u201cThe Gallery\u201d is, above all, a very fun metal album.\n",
        "\nI think that Dark Tranquillity is one of the most consistent bands in metal. No, they may not have always released albums that appealed to all fans. No, they may not have always been as heavy as a melodic death metal band should be but their creativity should never be called into question. As a matter of fact, I think there are some albums by these Gothenburg originals that get way more shit than they deserve. Their tenth full length, Construct, is one of those albums. It's taken me a lot of listens to actually come to appreciate this album for what it is. There is some really good music and a killer atmosphere on this album and it's time people recognize it. It's not without flaws but it's not the abomination some make it out to be.\n\nSome people think that the band was trying to create another Projector here but I don't see it that way. What I see is the perfect successor to We Are The Void, an album that I enjoyed. It didn't blow me away like Damage Done or Character but it was filled with an atmosphere that had me drawn to it for some reason. Don't get me wrong, Construct is not without its flaws as I feel the album opener, \"For Broken Words,\" is a weak track that should not have opened the album. \"The Silence of Noise\" is a much better song where the keys provide melody and the riffs are pure Dark Tranquillity. Mikael Stanne's voice is as solid as it's ever been. The leads towards the end of the song are nice and melodic even if they don't provide anything else. \"The Silence In Between\" is another that has some decent riffing as well as some really melodic parts provided by the keyboards. The softer passage in the middle adds atmosphere adding another dimension to this album. \"Apathetic\" is a beast of a song that just kicks your ass. This song has some of the heaviest riffing the band has done in year as well as a godly solo.\n\nI will admit that \"What Only You Know\" would not have been out of place on Projector or Haven. It's a good song with some wonderful melodies provided by the keys. Mikael Stanne's clean vocals are better than they were on any previous release. It appears that he has been working on his vocals because they were not flat in any place. I've never been a huge fan of his cleans but I can't deny that they work here. They tried their hand at it again on \"State of Trust\" but it did not work near as well as on \"What You Only Know.\" The song is quite chaotic trying to go in too many places at once. Stanne sounds good but not enough to save the song. Then you have a song like \"Endtime Hearts\" that is a nice mix of the aggressive riffing and melodies. The chorus has a catchy melody that makes the song that much better. The keyboards in the background create a nice atmosphere that mixes well with the rest of the sounds on this song. There is a nice solo going on in this song making it that much better. \"Weight of the End\" is another song that has some nice riffing as well as those signature DT keys providing the melodies. This song could have been on Character. It's heavy in places and melodic in others but the mix of both has always worked for this band and it works on this song as well.\n\nIt's funny that this album is a culmination of everything that makes Dark Tranquillity the great band that they are but it takes some serious heat. I'm not afraid to admit the album's faults because there are a few. \"None Becoming\" is one of these moments. This is a song that just does nothing for me. It's slow and plodding. It could have been much more because the keys provide a nice atmosphere. However, I think the highlights I have mentioned here is enough to not disregard the album as a whole. Even the worst moments here are not horrible. I suggest that you get the limited edition 2 CD for \"Immemorial\" alone. Even though this is a slower song it's got some beautiful melodies, nice riffing and a melodic solo that just makes the song a nice addition as a bonus track. The second disc is a live disc and if you have ever heard this band live you know that it is a nice treat. Love them or hate them, they can pull it off in the live setting.\n\nSo here it is, I have made my case for this album. With all it's flaws and given the fact that they have moved away from the sound that a lot of DT fans have come to love, this album has some damn fine moments and should not be disregarded in any way. This is the direction the band seems to be going in right now. Who knows what the next album will bring. This band seems to reinvent itself every few albums so the sky's the limit for this band. But in the mean time, I'm not afraid to admit that I like this album. I suggest a few more listens as I have done. You may see that it can grow on you.\n\n\nhttp://elitistmetalhead.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nWhile clearly not as deficient or meager as the album that directly followed it, We Are the Void shows various signs of decline and decay in the formula the band has utilized with reasonable success starting with Damage Done. At the same time, it exhibits a few areas of marked improvement that could have truly gone somewhere special if the band continued in this vein. This is essentially Fiction all over again, and while Construct can be viewed in a similar light, Dark Tranquillity was still mostly there at this point.\n\nWhat doesn't work needs to be addressed immediately, and is mercifully shoved out of the way fairly early in the album's procession. The first two tracks, especially \"Dream Oblivion\" are totally out of character and inert attempts at adding a dissonant, dark edge to the atmosphere. On past albums like Damage Done the cybernetic, barren landscape painted by the melodies was endearing and came as an end, not a means, of the quality songwriting. The band tries breaching that point by force here, and the songs suffer as a result. In fact, We Are the Void's biggest fault may be centered around this aspect, because when it plays the familiar cards we have grown accustomed to it passes muster if not excels. \n\nSnip off the first two songs alongside most of \"Arkhangelsk\" and you are left with a number of quality, if not redundant, tracks well worthy of the Dark Tranquillity name. As such, they still have the proclivity to sound a little samey and faceless if tackled in a single listening session. Regardless, \"In My Absence\" and \"I am the Void\" are both spectacular scorchers that run parallel with classics like \"Dry Run\" and \"Blind at Heart\". We Are the Void features the most crushing, bottom heavy guitar sound the band has ever committed to disc, with a tone as solid and tempered as the futuristic metropolises the band so proudly flaunts on many of their album covers. Jivarp likewise thunders by with a deep, cavernous thump to the bass drums and a balanced sheen to the top end of the kit that helps make up for a relatively understated percussive performance on the whole. The sterile, organic aesthetics of Fiction are also discarded for a roomier, more engrossing sonic palette that helps sell the opaque atmosphere evoked by the stabbing synths.\n\nSome of the other songs are neither here nor there from a memorability standpoint, not necessarily falling through the cracks but getting hung up in the purgatory in between all the same. The band takes two more stabs at the \"Misery's Crown\" approach with \"Her Silent Language\" and closer \"Iridium\". The former is considerably less offensive thanks to Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m's ever-poignant piano textures, but \"Iridium\" is overlong and far too meandering to be considered a success. The aforementioned \"Arkhangelsk\" sounds like the second coming of \"Lost to Apathy\" until the faceless stop-start riffing and Stanne's parched roars pull everything eternally downward. As with all Dark Tranquillity compositions, most of We Are the Void consists of short, accessible slabs of modern Gothenburg with a penchant for searingly memorable melodies and ambiance. While there are a boatload of bonus tracks amounting to nearly half of an album, I regret to say that the only one truly worth any time is \"Out of Gravity\". Track this one down if you can, as it features the greatest solo the band has executed since I can't even remember when.\n\nI can't help but feel that We Are the Void's lackluster public opinion is the main reason the band took such a drastic stylistic turn on Construct and subsequently fell to the greatest depths since Haven. It wasn't warranted, as this sits quite nicely next to Fiction and Character on my shelf, rarely accruing any modicum of dust. A more than worthy final chapter to Dark Tranquillity's post-millennial dominance.\n",
        "\nConstruct was built up as the second coming of the eclectic Projector prior to it's release, and as such my expectations were both measured and optimistic. While I found Fiction to be a more than worthy successor to the band's masterpiece Character, I admittedly hadn't kept up to date on the goings on within the Dark Tranquillity camp during the We are the Void debacle. So for me, this was akin to a fresh take on the band all over again.\n\nTo be blunt, I hear more of Fiction in this than Projector, as the atmosphere is perhaps more bleak and dissonant than ever. This is undoubtedly one of the group's darkest albums, but it has come at a high cost. Being a Gothenburg band at heart, Dark Tranquillity often lives and dies by the potency of their melodies. I'm not saying that band lacks cogency elsewhere, but most listeners undoubtedly look to Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m's synths and the biting lick of the melodic riffs for the lion's share of the appeal. Construct lacks most of these melodies, coming off as watered down and diffused in it's delivery. The hazy, dense mix certainly doesn't help, as the weary surges of distortion hog the spotlight and force Stanne's still-primal intonation into the shadows. There are less keyboards than ever, and the long-tenured Jivarp is relegated to doing little other than standing in the background of promo shots.\n\nConstruct is just so criminally uneventful. This is still Dark Tranquillity, but the band comes off like they are trying to force a subtle genre shift without losing their main fan base. Most were content with giving the band a free pass regarding the average We are the Void, but the deception is clear this time around. The band tries to force the Projector tag onto the album by attempting another \"UnDo Control\" with \"What Only You Know\". The opening melodies are quite rousing, and Stanne's clean tone still sounds great. Even so, the band is quick to devolve into the \"stock Dark Tranquillity riffing\" that has plagued every album since Haven to one degree or another. In fact, I can count the number of spirited riffing passages on this album on one hand alone. The normally reliable Sundin and Henriksson come off as complete afterthoughts, with the heavier sections sullied with a faux-brutality that Dark Tranquillity had always been careful to avoid in the past.\n\nAbsolutely nothing on here is even fit to shine the shoes of the worst of Fiction, but \"Endtime Hearts\" is still a clear standout. It fights against the band's attempts at devolving into the wafting, ethereal drop-out passages that pockmark the rest of the album and gets away with minor damage. \"Weight of the End\" also grooves quite nicely, with some neck-jerking appeal that I don't recall experiencing since \"Blind at Heart\" or \"Icipher\". I have the limited edition of the album, featuring two bonus tracks. \"Inmemorial\" is actually a decent throwback to Damage Done and would have fit nicely in the album's procession proper. Conversely, \"Photon Dreams\" is a complete waste of time and should be ignored as such. \n\nWhile it is without a doubt a massive disappointment on the whole, Construct does get better as it goes on. The inert one-two combo of \"For Broken Word\" and \"The Silence of Noise\" has likely turned a lot of potential listeners off before the rest of the album had a chance to stick. It is certainly a varied listen, and fans of the bands cryptic mid period near the waning years of Johansson's tenure might find something of value here. As a final note, the artwork is the most bland and unimaginative mockup Sundin has ever committed to the digital medium. Not the band's finest hour, and the worst since Haven.\n",
        "\nWhat a frustrating album.\n\nRealistically, I'm well beyond \"late\" in reviewing this album. I'm so late to the party all the guests have left and I'm practically breaking and entering into the host's condo while our generous host is in bed making passionate love to one of the guests. He's full of vigor, life, and feeling, openly expressing all of his emotions in the most honest and endearing experience he could possibly muster. Then he embarrassingly finishes early, weeping and apologizing, \"This has never happened before!\" But you know it has. Oh, you know it has.\n\nAnd that, folks, explains this album. Mikael is screaming his lungs out about his inner void and it truly shows. \"The Fatalist\" clear through \"Arkhangelsk\" are full of such turmoil and passion you can feel it seeping off the harrowing, gothic-tinged keys and the guitars bellowing out in pain. It's the Dark Tranquillity style of raw intensity, but it's a different kind of intensity. It's not unadulterated rage unlike the three albums prior. It's sorrow. It's a sorrow that was hinted at multiple times (hello, \"Format C: For Cortex,\" \"My Negation,\" and \"Inside the Particle Storm\"), but they didn't feel like they could truly express it. After years of trying to repress it, it's exploded perhaps a bit too suddenly.\n\nThere's an intense atmosphere I can't deny. Along with the synth-laden gothic vibe and overall plodding pace when compared to typical DT work, there's an increase in soft bridges and Mikael's beautiful baritone voice showing up periodically in a way not heard since Projector. The album strides along a progressive, uphill slope, the heavy atmosphere becoming increasingly prevalent until it hits its peak in \"Her Silent Language\" and \"Arkhangelsk.\" The former sees Stanne taking his cleans to full force, producing a heartfelt, balladesque track, while the latter skyrockets the intensity and takes a few notes from Norwegian black metal in its dissonant rage. In a sense, they're polar opposites, yet they both encapsulate exactly what sets this album apart: feeling, passion, and strength, and they are without doubt two of the best songs this band has ever done.\n\nThe problem isn't in the album's middle, no, it's in the album's beginning. The first two tracks - \"Shadow in Our Blood\" and \"Dream Oblivion\" - are utterly pointless. They're not even B-sides to the album. They're like Character B-sides, and Character is already my least favorite DT album since The Mind's I. They're intended to be more aggressive, but in reality they're generic melodeath tracks with tacked on, boring riffs, and they feel completely out of place with the rest of the album. The most they bring is a couple slick choruses that give you a glimpse of the album's coming content. They're like the newbies at a self-help seminar, too afraid to let out how much they hate their lives and instead mumbling here and there while constantly being talked over by the veterans who are openly expressing themselves and feel much better for it. Ironically enough, the title track is the third orphan in this group, fitting alongside \"Shadow in Our Blood\" and \"Dream Oblivion.\" Of course, right after that momentary dip, the album picks right up where it left off and crescendos to another emotional peak through \"Surface the Infinite\" into \"Iridium\" - both stellar tracks, dank and dour, and fitting right along the album's middle.\n\nOkay, so, maybe that previous analogy should've been reversed. It's more like a guy who has trouble getting started, has a small hiccup, but then explodes in a grand finish. Nah, that's less accurate, because Dark Tranquillity have been throwing out filler tracks in every album since Haven. It's happened before, dammit.\n\nIf the first two tracks and the title track had been lopped off, this easily could've been my favorite Dark Tranquillity album and straight up one of my favorite albums period. These guys aren't at their best when they're trying to churn out generic melodeath riffs with no feeling. They're at their best when they sink into their mellow side and let their passion swallow them, just like they were trying back with Projector (and, to a lesser extent, Haven), before their ignorant fanbase ostracized them and forced them to regress into their Gothenburg aggression. \n\nAnd I think they were really trying to bring a bit of that back here in this album, but... well, the damage was done.\n",
        "\nSomething is going on here, mostly as a result of creative compositions packed to the brim with multiple shifts in both temper and mood. While Dark Tranquillity later streamlined their songwriting approach, the more spastic compositional style that makes albums like Skydancer so endearing is also present here on The Gallery. The lack of keyboards is still a concern, as it puts an inordinate amount of pressure on the animated leads to deliver the melodic goods. While the band's rhythm section has never been one of it's strengths, Johansson's leads are both agitated and memorable, carrying the bulk of The Gallery on their back alone.\n\nThe first four tracks are all among the band's best work. \"Punish My Heaven\" serves as a functional enough introduction, but it is \"The Dividing Line\" that makes the strongest individual case here. Tense sounding leads open up into rocking, groovy powerchords as the song transfers from style to style. What also becomes evident around this point is the busy nature of some of these tracks. It very nearly comes off as a compositional flaw at times, as the band throws just about everything except the kitchen sink into numbers like the title track and \"Lethe\". This doesn't necessarily come off as desperate though, since they manage to pull most of these experiments off. Some brooding, bass-driven numbers like \"Edenspring\" hint at future elements present on albums like The Mind's I, giving the listener a chance to catch his breath between apoplectic cuts like \"Silence, and the Firmament Withdrew\" and scorchers such as \"The Dividing Line\".\n\nWhere The Gallery begins to show thin points at the seams is during it's second half, which suffers from too many deviations from the winning formula such as the pointless instrumental \"Mine Is the Grandeur...\". \"Midway Through Infinity\" embodies the last attempt at a compact and focused song, as many of the waning moments of The Gallery feature overlong and tired compositions like the closer \"...of Melancholy Burning\". The aforementioned instrumental deviously builds suspense for this one, only for the entire ordeal to fall apart under the weight of it's own pretense. The female vocals come off as window dressing, distracting from the luster of the leads and Stanne's dessicated roars. Still, even the most meandering of these songs have their moments, as the band refuses to stay in place for any extended period of time.\n\nThe Gallery's production values aren't very high, which serves as both a blessing and a curse in this context. The now-legendary Nordstr\u00f6m buries the rhythm guitar more than I would like, as Jivarp's kit overpowers much of it's surge and renders too much of the performance inert. Even during the amazing \"The Dividing Line\" you can tell that the song has sacrificed some of it's angry disposition along with the potency of the rhythm guitar. The rest of the band sounds passable, and as always on Dark Tranquillity's earlier albums the stronger bass presence adds a neat counterpoint to the attention-hogging leads.\n\nWhile it undoubtedly serves as the one brooding warning that the band's experimental side was beginning to take over, The Gallery still holds up fairly well by virtue of it's animated leads alone. Most definitely not the all-time classic it is often lauded as, but it has it's place in history all the same.\n",
        "\nExisting as an amalgam of B-sides from The Mind's I sessions, the performance and approach here are both naturally quite shaky and lacking in some of the killer instinct present on classics like The Gallery. This was clearly a period of identity crisis for the band, and it persisted until they finally emptied their experimental accretions on Projector.\n\nMost of these songs come off as less polished The Gallery material. That's not to say there is a lack of quality songwriting and singeing melodic passages though. It definitely has an appeal, as Johansson's leads are animated and always popping up where you least expect them. \"Razorfever\" actually has some solid galloping sections and sticky leadwork. Even as it later devolves into typical Dark Tranquillity posturing, the surge of the melodies take center stage above the burly rhythm section in a potent manner. The Iron Maiden-esque leads that open \"Shadowlit Facade\" are searing and memorable, as they give way to Stanne's parched roar with Henriksson's overdriven bass grumbling in the forefront of the mix.\n\nTo address the elephant in the room, \"Archetype\" is a complete waste of time from a metal standpoint. It is seriously a throbbing techno beat with samples of Stanne's past lyrics repeated ad nauseam over the churning dance drums. Swells of distortion ebb and flow throughout in a vain effort to keep the entire thing heavy. This theme is hinted at during the beginning of \"Razorfever\", but the listener can't possibly be prepared for this atypical curveball in any sense. The guitars come off as an afterthought as the synthetic nature of the song is just so abrasive and overwhelming. The first time I heard it I literally burst out laughing (which takes a lot to pull off if you are privy to my taste), but it isn't the worst thing ever. It sounds like it was constructed using tracker software, and as such it absolutely screams of the soundtrack to the PC game Unreal Tournament. \n\nWhat confounds me is why Enter Suicidal Angels was released prior to The Mind's I as opposed to after, since this material is not a terribly cohesive representation of that album's melodic workings. \"Zodijackyl Light\" is the only song here that actually appears on the group's oft-overlooked 1997 album, forcing the rest of this material into obscurity. That isn't to say some of this doesn't deserve to be buried where few can find it, but I would personally love to see mode polished incarnations of both \"Razorfever\" and \"Shadowlit Facade\". They would benefit greatly from less archaic production values and have some potential. Worth seeking out for die-hard fans and those looking for a laugh.\n",
        "\nWhile the long-tenured Dark Tranquillity are generally revered for their long-lasting contributions to the Gothenburg scene, their career hasn't been without some ups and downs. While releasing near-classics like The Gallery and Character, the group's proverbial sun has also fired a few blanks in the form of Haven and more recent disappointments like We Are the Void. As reviled as the band's material may be in certain circles, Damage Done has somehow managed to maintain a high reputation even though it still contains plenty of Haven-era aesthetics.\n\nI hate to draw comparisons, but if my arm was twisted I suppose I would classify Damage Done as an angrier, more dissonant Character. This doesn't mean all of it sticks however, as a lot of this album can be criminally boring due to the lack of catchy keyboard textures. The album can be deceptive in this regard, as songs often open up with fucking promising synth arrangements like \"Single Part of Two\" only to quickly drop them and return to stock Gothenburg posturing. That isn't to say Damage Done lives or dies by Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m's contributions alone, as there are also some solid riff-driven numbers like the title track and \"White Noise / Black Silence\". The stronger, longer lasting riffs are a characteristic that stands out on first blush, as Damage Done actually recovers quite convincingly from the toothless Haven. The compressed, overdriven surges of distortion rumble under the modern sheen of the spastic leadwork, forming a fairly coherent assault that is only augmented by the sparse keyboard elements.\n\nDark Tranquillity's typical foreboding atmosphere still surfaces when it wants to, like during the phenomenal instrumental \"Ex Nihilo\". It isn't that Stanne comes off as a distraction as his dessicated roars are actually quite potent, but this one gives the leads and throbbing keys a chance to cut as deep as they possibly can. The bonus track \"I, Deception\" has more keyboards and is worth tracking down if you can find it, as it shows the direction that the band could have taken had they decided to release another straight-transposition of Haven. \"The Treason Wall\" features a more animated performance on the kit by the long-tenured Jivarp, and the twinkling keys during the verses embody Damage Done at it's most potent and searing.\n\nRegardless, a lot of this album can be quite wanting from an experimental standpoint, as some neat Projector-isms would serve it well and fill in the gaps where interest normally begins to wane. Damage Done sounds burly enough, with Nicklasson's low-end roar challenging the piercing sheen of the leadwork for the spotlight at times. The rhythm section has plenty of meat on it's bones, almost so much that it begins to damage the lasting power of the keyboards.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Damage Done is solid, but I personally can't find much time for it's acerbic delivery and more riff-based theatrics. I feel like this doesn't play to Dark Tranquillity's strengths, even if it has a wider appeal overall. If you are fond of the band's modern material but find the constant keyboard presence too distracting, check this one out.\n",
        "\nWhile viewing Manifesto of Dark Tranquillity as the compilation that it is, it certainly seems to serve it's purpose as a fairly compact, succinct taste of what the band has to offer. Every release starting with Projector is symbolized by at least three songs, save for four representing the then-new Fiction and the lukewarm Haven. So methodical is this approach that the listener almost forgets that most of the Johansson-era material is disregarded entirely. This is what rubs me the wrong way. Why include the most experimental full-length with Johansson: Projector, only to disregard the rest?\n\nIt doesn't even have to be linear, as albums like The Gallery would have made fine single-song contributions like the absolutely scorching \"The Dividing Line\" or \"Punish My Heaven\". These would have been much more welcomed in the procession compared to the limp-wristed title track from Haven. While the band naturally has to skew the material toward their more recent releases, even the tracks taken from Fiction are hit-or-miss. \"Terminus (Where Death Is Most Alive)\" almost has to be included as per it's mainstream sensibilities, but \"The Lesser Faith\" and \"Misery's Crown\" were most definitely not standouts from that album. I would have much rather had \"Blind at Heart\" or \"Icipher\", which are both catchier and more compact to begin with.\n\nDamage Done comes out of this affair with the least amount of damage, although I personally would have swapped the faceless \"Monochromatic Stains\" with \"Format C: for Cortex\". The inclusion of four tracks from Haven proves that the band is quite fond of it, a sentiment I certainly don't share with them. Regardless, the two best songs from that album are both present and accounted for: \"Indifferent Suns\", \"The Wonders at Your Feet\". \n\nDark Tranquillity was wise enough to choose the most experimental, atypical number from Projector an a nod to their experimental past, that being \"UnDo Control\". While that is my favorite song from that album, the inclusion of the average \"ThereIn\" begins to pull the proceedings back down to Earth. Shoehorning in the upbeat \"The Sun Fired Blanks\" only serves to drive the point home that there are decent, rocking numbers present on the earlier albums that most certainly have a place in compilations like Manifesto of Dark Tranquillity.\n\nThe potency of Manifesto of Dark Tranquillity's approach is almost entirely dependent on the listener's curiosity regarding the band's earlier material. While it is a decent-enough snapshot of the group's post-The Mind's I compositions, it doesn't represent their entire career like a true compilation should.\n",
        "\nBeing the last album to feature Johansson on guitar, Projector embodies the end of an era regarding Dark Tranquillity's approach. They would begin to streamline their sound after this album with Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m's electronic orhestrations as the centerpiece. There are still keyboards here, but the performance is generally more subdued and downplayed in light of the more experimental aesthetics elsewhere.\n\nWhat needs to be addressed immediately are the glaring departures in approach that are \"UnDo Control\" and \"Day to End\". The latter features Stanne's burly clean inflection alongside throbbing swells of electronics. His voice isn't amazing, but it exudes a decent amount of emotion and is passable for what it is. \"UnDo Control\" is a horse of another color, featuring saccharine female vocals alongside more agitated verses. The reverb-drenched acoustic textures that counterpoint the clean vocals are very searing and memorable, making you wish the band would just drop the back-and-forth aesthetic and deliver an entire song in this fashion. \"Auctioned\" is another Stanne-driven piece that wouldn't sound out of place in a smoky nightclub, as the bare-bones percussive backbone is joined by uplifting piano melodies and understated riffs. Again, it is effective for what it is even if it comes completely out of left field for Dark Tranquillity.\n\nThe more rocking numbers like \"On Your Time\" are potent, although they come off as a bit of an afterthought in the procession. I'm not even kidding, the biggest appeal of this album is centered around the slower, moodier stylistic departures like \"UnDo Control\". At any rate, Johnansson gets an effective sendoff in the form of \"The Sun Fired Blanks\", which wouldn't sound out of place on The Gallery. The sticky leads coexist marvelously with the grooving verses, making this one a keeper at the end of the day. Projector sounds much more balanced than its direct successor, featuring an upfront, natural bass timbre. Henriksson is hardly an amazing player, but as many of these songs feature multiple atmospheric, soft interludes the bass gets plenty of time in the spotlight. Jivarp's kit sounds passable, but he has little to work with as so much of this material is slow paced and stately in it's approach.\n\nA lot of it falls flat though, as some of the heavier songs like \"Nether Novas\" seem less sure of themselves, wafting back and forth between heavy and subdued. It almost comes off as a necessary risk considering the disparate elements being combined here on Projector. It is an interesting compositional avenue worth exploring further, but fails to inspire for the entire duration all the same. Track down \"UnDo Control\". If you can stomach that check out the rest of Projector, as it certainly has it's moments. If there is one album that can be deemed \"not for everybody\" this is most definitely it.\n",
        "\nAs the first notes of \"Nothing to No One\" rumble through your speakers, it becomes obvious that Fiction desperately wants to be Character Part II. It very nearly achieves this goal at several junctures, although it's more experimental nature pulls the proceedings into a more progressive direction more often than not. Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m approaches the keyboards from a more organic perspective, shying away from the heavy use of electronica elements that had dogged albums like Haven. The one exception is \"Terminus (Where Death Is Most Alive)\", which desperately tries to take a stab at mainstream appeal whilst retaining the bobbing and weaving of the Gothenburg patterns. It comes off as a slightly more well built \"The Wonders at Your Feet\", featuring a neck-jerking groove during the chorus and an infectious main synth line.\n\nWhile Fiction follows familiar trappings at first, it gets more experimental as it goes on. The otherwise average \"Misery's Crown\" features some crooning vocal passages courtesy of Stanne. He sounds pretty good here, much better than the overacted warbling present on Haven. \"The Mundane and the Magic\" features the chick from Theatre of Tragedy for some reason. I can go either way regarding these female vocal contributions that Dark Tranquillity feels the need to shoehorn into certain songs. It came off as more novel and appealing on Projector anyway. Conversely, we get some heavier riff-monsters like \"Focus Shift\" and \"Icipher\", the latter of which pulverizes the best of Character courtesy of it's monolithic inclinations. Regardless, \"Blind at Heart\" steals the spotlight from all of these. It starts off formulaic by Dark Tranquillity standards, but the churning tremolo verses that open into the stirring chorus embody the best of this album's approach.\n\nFiction's production features interesting attributes that aren't necessarily unwelcome. Most glaringly, Jivarp's kit features barely any reverb. His snare has a snappy pop to it that helps him cut through the multiple layers that usually obfuscate the mix. This adds character to his mechanized percussive assault, as per Fiction's prospective atmosphere. A good example is \"Empty Me\", which has some decent blasting patterns that serve the more agitated riffs well. The somber piano melody during it's chorus is searingly memorable as well, so don't miss that one if anything. \"The Lesser Faith\" also gets some decent drum-driven grooves going during it's verses, even without much input from Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m.\n\nFiction tries to settle into the stagnant Gothenburg formula at times, but there is just enough variation to keep it's head above water. Even so, some tracks like \"The Mundane and the Magic\" try to inveigle the listener by muddying the creative waters with melodramatic fluff, coming off as more offensive than they need to be. Fiction is more effective when viewed as an amalgamation of differing songwriting styles as opposed to a cohesive experience. Solid for what it is.\n",
        "\nThis has its moments, but my opinion of Haven has done nothing but erode as the years have passed. It isn't that this is even far removed from more structured and coherent albums like Character, but it fails to summon equal levels of enthusiasm all the same. While Dark Tranquillity's abstruse approach during their mid-period is most glaringly evident on Projector, Haven is certainly not far behind.\n\nBr\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m's keyboards evoke such a tiresome, plastic atmosphere that it puts way too much pressure on the riffs. Riffs that fail to inspire fully and have never been the band's strong point in the first place. The keys try to add a classy, synthetic undercurrent but the atmosphere is akin to cheap sci-fi B-movie like Space Mutiny as opposed to the Blade Runner approach they are aiming for. The spirited leads have potential, but this should be a given in a Gothenburg band. Occasionally the band gets a decent mid-paced surge going, only to discard it for tepid drop-outs featuring Stanne's overacted inflection. The somber inclinations of \"Ego Drama\" are passable, as is most of \"Indifferent Suns\". For some reason these two take much better advantage of the melancholic atmosphere and arouse a decent ambiance as the churning riffs hold everything together.\n\n\"The Wonders at Your Feet\" is decent and rocking, though. The approach isn't abashedly different, but there is a bit more of a fire lit under the band's ass for some reason. The buzzing synth lines remind me of Pasi Hiltula from Kalmah, and the results are easy to keep around at the end of the day. The solo is also ace, which again, is normally an afterthought with Dark Tranquillity. The band has the tendency to build up solid foundations with the keyboards and Stanne's normally rock-solid contributions, only to kneecap themselves when the riffs fail to inspire on an equal level. Others, like \"Feast of Burden\", (which actually features an interesting dance drum break) fall through the cracks as the luster of the synths begin to dull. The title track has an infectious chorus and some searing leads, but Stanne's whispering, robotic warbling during the verses make it embarrassing to listen to.\n\nI can't help but feel that the guitars would have a better chance at salvaging Haven if they weren't so sonically gutted. There are some decent rhythm guitar passages, but they are so overlooked and buried that the whole thing comes off as trite. The pitter-patter of Jivarp's kit does little to add to the dearth of heaviness, joining the clangy bass timbre in the sea of trebly tones that constitute most of Haven's sonic palette. Take \"Fabric\" for example, which opens with solid atmospherics that build tension in an affable manner; but once the rest of the band comes in flaunting their weary powerchords it flops over and dies. The second half of this song also sounds like the SNES recreation of \"My Heart Will Go On\" at times, so no thanks.\n\nI feel like I have to stress that I don't necessarily hate this synthetic approach to the keyboards. I am a keyboardist myself for God's sake, but Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m lacks the restraint here that is required to churn out a true winner like Character. Less is very often more.\n",
        "\nWhile Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m wisely scaled back his presence on Haven's oft-lauded followup Damage Done, I couldn't find much room in my heart for it's acerbic delivery and more straightforward disposition. The band shifted the pieces yet again for 2005's Character, which is once again dripping in electronics. The difference here is that the guitars have the wherewithal to back the synths up, achieving a balance that represents Dark Tranquillity at their most lethal.\n\nThe guitars still have the tendency to devolve into stock Gothenburg posturing, but there are plenty of exceptions here. The verses of \"Dry Run\" feature inventively timed swells of distortion and a neck-jerking groove with bouncy inclinations, making it the best cut here. The churning intro of \"The New Build\" immediately blows any lingering doubts out of the water with it's deliberate melodic aesthetics. The sludgy tremolo passages later on only serve to drive the fact home that the band is just much more focused this time around. It isn't that Damage Done had inferior riffs, but it lacked the multi-dimensional assault on the senses evident during most of Character. The guitars feature a biting modern tone that serves the more busy riffing passages quite well. The guitars aren't quite as overdriven as on the preceding album, but they rip all the same.\n\nStanne is even more focused here, radiating his overacted roars all over the place. Listen to the chorus of \"Lost to Apathy\". Where was that killer instinct during Haven? While some of the somber atmosphere is gone along with his cleaner crooning, it matters little during emotional mid-paced cookers like \"One Thought?\" and \"Am I 1\"? These two can be viewed as twins in style and substance, serving as a decent counterpoint to the more straightforward genre trappings present here. \"The Endless Feed\" also stands out on first listen, featuring a synthetic disposition that hails back to \"Indifferent Suns\". This is where Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m makes the biggest impact, as he finally manages to evoke a classy atmosphere that lacks the tiresome plastic-sounding inclinations present on Projector and Haven. His synth arrangements along with the grand scope of the album remind me of the PC game Deus Ex, which is a high honor from an atmospheric standpoint. Jivarp ups the ante and benefits the most from the higher production values. His controlled blasting during certain passages forces the rest of the band to keep up, and we as listeners benefit greatly from it.\n\nCharacter isn't perfect though, mostly as a result of deep-rooted imbalances in the band's primary approach. Some more soaring lead sections could have lifted this to greatness, but Character ends up falling slightly short and lacking the extra dimension it really needs to thrive on the highest level. It is so methodical and workmanlike in it's approach that the lack of peaks or valleys becomes both the biggest blessing and curse. View this album as a companion piece to Fiction as they both feature similar sonic aesthetics along with the best of what Dark Tranquillity has to offer.\n",
        "\nOh how far this band has come. It seems Dark Tranquillity have graced us with a slightly industrial take on their sound as of late in \"Construct\", which shouldn't surprise people given the keyboard's increasing presence on their past few albums, but they could have gone about this in an entirely less one-dimensional manner and nothing would have been lost, nor would it have been much more effort. That Dark Tranquillity chose a more mediocre direction should surprise no one. I think nearly every chord progression used on Construct can be traced to previous albums. I honestly did not think Dark Tranquillity could fill an album with more repetitive chugging than We Are The Void, but they have done that here. \n\nIn all honestly, Construct was hard to rate. It was well constructed (pardon the pun) so it made me want to rate it higher, and Stanne's clean vox sound better and silkier than ever. However, the nagging repetitiveness of the music makes listening to the whole album a chore, and the skip button should definitely be handy. In the usual Dark Tranquillity form of uniform song lengths is again at play here, except this time ALL the songs are in that 3-4 minute range, yet many feel like they drone on for eternity. That could be that many times, THE MAIN RIFFS CONSIST OF WHOLE NOTES. This is not doom metal, and honestly wouldn't work as doom metal either way, due to its complete lack of dynamics and pop-like atmosphere. Jeez, the more I am listening to this now the lower the rating goes. On one hand, there is more variety than We Are The Void, but on the other hand I keep finding that the last 2 minutes of each song is really unnecessary, and how unoriginal this album is when the rest of this bands discography is taken into context, riffwise. \n\nIn the end, I have to take into account how many ideas there are, riffwise, on Construct. And by how many ideas, I mean how many NEW ideas. It seems there are few on Construct. It is indeed well put together, and I do not pretend that the band and the producers labored intensely in the execution of this album's ideas. This would be one of those cases where the core concept was good, and the execution was pretty solid, but something just failed in the in between process. And that thing is solid songwriting. That is, the process of getting from \"Uh, it sounds kinda like genre x and band y, with a hint of genre z and faster/slower\" to a song ready to record and then the final product. Too many times mediocre ideas get repeated, and this is humorously captured in the song Apathetic, who's creative bankruptcy should strike someone as a song made by a band making fun of Dark Tranquillity, rather than the real thing. Both the opener, For Broken Words, and the next song, The Science of Noise, feature whole notes as most of their riffs. Being the opening songs, they are (arguably) the most aggressive. That should tell you where the rest of the album will take you.\n\nIn the end, no amount of overdubbing, studio wizardry, solid performances, flashy electronics, and Stanne's wonderful voice (woefully restrained to only a few songs unfortunately) can save a lack of songwriting, and Dark Tranquillity have been running on fumes it seems for quite some time. I really want to like this, since this is an industrial take on their newer sound with Stanne's clean singing, but the severe lack of new ideas, and the fact that this felt familiar from the first listen, just condemns this album to have very little replay value, so in the end I feel this low rating is completely justified.\n",
        "\nWhen I review music, there's 2 habits I am definitely trying to avoid nowadays, and they are reviewing albums from genres I don't even like, and not giving the music a fair chance. While some might know that I have never traditionally liked Gothenburg melodeath, I also have always made an exception for Dark Tranquillity. I got into the band via Projector, but after that tried (as I usually do) to listen to the albums in chronological order. Up to and including Projector, I find the band to be quite exceptional. While I found that Haven was a bit \"same-y\", I still enjoyed Damage Done, although I could hear the signs of decay in the album Character. There seemed to be an ever draining well of creativity, and I wondered how much longer their creativity would last.\n\nWhich brings us to We Are the Void. I can sum up the entire issue with We Are the Void like this: if you just listen to one or two songs off this album, you'll probably like them. I did. The signs of commercialism were obvious and all over the place, but let's face it, Dark Tranquillity are still able musicians and are still able to make their songs sound enjoyable. The problem lies in trying to listen to the whole album. I put it on, and rocked out for about 2 songs. I still soldiered through, but by the song \"In My Absence\" I really started to lose interest. This is because every song IS IN THE SAME KEY, HAS THE SAME TEMPO, AND THE SAME CHUGGING GUITARS! Seriously, any riff, on any song, would not sound out of place on any other song, and they're all crap riffs! Seriously, the good riff:mindless chugging ratio must be close to 1:100 or something like that. It's ridiculous. Hell, all the songs are even 3-4 minutes, except the closer, which gives this album an even more monotonous feel.\n\nBefore the reader brings up the point that Projector had a lot of chugging, let I remind ourselves that Projector had a lot of things going for it, and the guitars really weren't the centerpiece of the album. We Are the Void, unfortunately HAS no centerpiece. In a way, this is almost a creeping nu-rock (I refuse to call it nu-metal, it's not metal) influence, in that there is some use of electronics (which, in it of itself, I'm in NO way opposed to) coupled with mid-tempo chugging and angsty lyrics. What makes that even more grating is that they are Swedish and this was made in 2010. well after nu-rock lost its popularity. But to the pain of my ears, this is nauseatingly radio friendly. \n\nHowever, I can't give this a complete zero because while this is blatant radio crap, it's HIGH QUALITY blatant radio crap made by a former death metal band from Sweden. At some level, that counts for something. Because like I said, if you listen to an individual song, and ignore all the blatant cheese and radio friendliness, it's a good mindless song to blast at full volume. But perhaps the reader of this can stand a whole album of nothing but midtempo drop B chugging with angsty lyrics, and after all, Dark Tranquillity always had emotional lyrics, but I cannot stand listening to such an album all the way through. I soldiered through, but it was no easy task. Needless to say, this album's not going on any future playlists of mine.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing three albums very similar to each other, I did not expect any change in the sound of Dark Tranquillity. Even finding We Are The Void an album below the capacity and talent of the band, I believed the new album would follow the same line. \n\nHowever, Construct presents a slower and quieter Dark Tranquillity, without blast beats, with very few fast tracks, making use like never before of Martin Brandstrom\u2019s keyboard and Mikael Stanne\u2019s clean vocals. In the essence, it follows the same idea of Projector, but with a tone a little more progressive and gothic-based. The main difference is that all the songs in Construct have the same rhythm and speed, none of them being pure ballad or pure heavy. The melodies are present almost all the time on all tracks, leaving little room for passages purely death, like it was common in the classics Damage Done and Character. Construct seems to be a blending of the sound Dark Tranquillity developed in its previous 9 albums.\n\nIndividually, we must highlight the brilliant work of Mikael Stanne and the pair of guitarists Niklas Sundin and Martin Henriksson. Stanne shows a versatility never seen before, leading masterfully his clean vocals amid harsh gutturals whose power and feeling demonstrate his full maturation as the frontman of the band (listen to Uniformity). The creativity of the melodies and the construction of the arrangements are the great advantage and difference of Construct, merit of his pair of guitarists that made Dark Tranquillity sound less aggressive than in the past albums, tending at a more melancholic and doomy rhythm, that reminds me quite the latest releases of Nevermore, Katatonia and Daylight Dies. \n\nConstruct is an album that needs to be heard more than once in order to be understood and many fans of the recent work of the band will not be satisfied with this new phase. This is an album for open minded listeners that can enjoy their old slow and more emotional works as Projector and Haven, and that do not concern only with the constant carnage of fast riffs and drums, characteristic of typical names like Mors Principium Est and Soilwork. \n\nThen, why am I not giving Construct a higher score? Because the excess of melancholic and maybe gothic elements, alongside with the odd and slow structure of most of the songs tend to bore the listener after the second or third time you listen to it. So, if you want to fully appreciate the art within this album, you must not listen to it continuously. Take a break and put Construct to play again after two or three days.\n\n\nwww.opuspoculto.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity\u2019s Yesterworlds compilation consists of remasters of their two pre-Skydancer demos as Dark Tranquillity (but not the one as Septic Broiler), along with some unreleased material from between their first and second albums, in chronological order. Consequently, it gives the listener a feel for the early evolution of the band. There is a significant difference in sound quality between the remastered versions and the originals, but this is not just a compilation for hardcore fans who want to own the most complete discographies and listenable versions of rare early demos. The songs themselves are pretty solid, comparable to much of Skydancer, along with having their own charms that could make them preferable to material off many other actual Dark Tranquillity albums for some. \n\nYesterworld begins with the atmospheric intro \u201cMidwinter\u201d from the 1991 Trail of Life Decayed demo, a track which showcases the prominent folk influence in their early material with the acoustic guitar, yet somehow manages to sound twisted and eerie, perhaps partially due to the production or lack thereof. This eerie feel continues throughout the first few demos. The minute long intro suddenly transitions into the frantic \u201cBeyond Enlightenment\u201d, a track that makes the influence of German thrash on the band\u2019s early sound very obvious. There are moments of this track which remind one of later Dark Tranquillity; Skydancer or perhaps The Gallery, but for the most part it is pure, raw thrash with a hint of dark atmosphere. I must also point out that Anders Friden does a pretty good job with the vocals on these demos; I would honestly say his performance here is better than on Skydancer and a decent amount of In Flames (certainly the later stuff). The vocals are especially effective when he overdubs lower pitched growls. The third track, \u201cVernal Awakening\u201d continues in the vein of \u201cBeyond Enlightenment\u201d with a brief atmospheric intro into similar raw thrash with just a hint of the sound that would become melodeath. It ends up being some pretty enjoyable stuff. The bizarre rock n\u2019 roll-ish drum intro to \"Void of Tranquillity\" kills the dark mood for a bit, but the song picks up and ends up being somewhat reminiscent of some other forward thinking Swedish death metal; I am particularly reminded of early Edge of Sanity. Though it begins weak, the song closes strong with a beautiful piano outro. \n\nWith \u201cUnfurled By Dawn\u201d, we are now up to material from the 1992 Moonclad Reflection EP, consisting only of two rather long songs. These two have more of a melodic death sound and are less derivative of thrash, yet the raw, frantic quality is still there. \u201cYesterworld\u201d is a particularly strong track, with many diverse sections that are all pretty solid, from the beautiful guitar harmonies in the intro to the frantic blast beat sections. With the last four tracks we see a lineup change as the familiar voice of Mikael Stanne takes over. While the first \u201cPunish My Heaven\u201d and \u201cAway, Delight Away\u201d could be seen as merely lesser versions of the ones released on The Gallery and Of Chaos and Eternal Night, it is interesting to hear Stanne sing the female part in \u201cThe Gallery\u201d. The closing track, another version of \u201cPunish My Heaven\u201d, is a worthwhile more frantic alternative to the version on \u201cThe Gallery\u201d, and personally I don\u2019t mind hearing that song twice in 20 minutes because It may be the band\u2019s best. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this compilation to the sort of melodic death metal fan that likes a little more \u201cdeath\u201d in the sound (or, perhaps more accurately, thrash), as the material is much more raw and frantic sounding than later, more polished DT without being devoid of melody or good song structure. Though more than half of the compilation was already released on \u201cExposures \u2013 In Retrospect and Denial\u201d and the rest consists of demo versions of songs that were released elsewhere, for someone who doesn\u2019t already own that compilation, I would suggest skipping it and getting \u201cYesterworlds\u201d. Since Dark Tranquillity put out a bunch of reissues in 2009, everything from \u201cExposures\u201d is now available elsewhere and with additional previously unreleased material (see the \u201cProjector\u201d, \u201cHaven\u201d and \u201cDamage Done\u201d reissues).\n",
        "\nHere we are: we waited since \"We Are The Void\", released in the year of 2010, but it was worth the waiting. The album is nicely constructed, and Dark Tranquillity have showed us, as they have already showed lots of times, that they don't get lost in the middle of the fog: \"We Are The Void\" wasn't nicely accepted by some of the fans and critics, Daniel Antonsson is gone and there was a burden on their shoulders, because some people wanted them to return to their glorious days, when they released albums like \"Skydancer\" or \"The Gallery\". But, well, as it was said a few lines above, they don't easily get lost in the middle of the fog...\n\nThis album shows us some innovations and some returns to old habits. As usual, Dark Tranquillity tried to take a certain stylistic jump from \"We Are The Void\" to \"Construct\" because, quoting Mikael Stanne in an interview given by him to Loud! Magazine: \"(...) when we started to deal with this new album, we had a bad taste in the mouth yet [Mikael is making a reference to the hard work and some frustration involving the making of \"We Are The Void\"] and we did not want to return to it\". This is the explanation for the innovations that Dark Tranquillity made from \"WATV\" to this most recent album. One of these innovations is, for example, the new guitar riffs that we can listen in some songs. Beautiful melodies are created by some of this guitar riffs, not despising some of the guitar riffs used in other albums. We can also notice that in the album \"Fiction\" the keyboards were represented in a different way than they are in \"Construct\". A small change can also be heard in the beginning of \"For Broken Words\", with that sound that enters through our ears and stays there for a lot of time, and you don't have to listen to it many times. This sound can be heard in some songs, and it is one of the new things this album offers to the listeners.\n\nThe returns to the old habits had to exist: either DT returned to some old sounds or there would still be a lot of people asking why they didn't do it. And one of the things that they had to do, necessarily, was the using of clean vocals. We can realize that Stanne's clean vocals are strongly present in \"Construct\". This is, after all, sort of a gift Mikael has in his voice. Some of us may ask ourselves why he doesn't use his clean vocals more often, and Mikael says why in the interview given to Loud! Magazine: \"I like to sing that way because it is off my comfort zone (...) that kind of challenges is always interesting. (...) But for now I like to use my clean vocals only as an extra \"spice\". Just like a keyboard or a guitar solo\".\n\nNow referring to the music as one solid and whole piece. As it was already said, there are awesome new guitar riffs but some are kept the same, with, of course, a few adjustments. Mikael has the same outstanding growls, fused with his magnificent clean vocals. The bass had to be performed by Martin Henriksson, but, still, he managed to do a great job. The keyboards create a perfect atmosphere, and they go really well along with the drums, the guitars, the bass and the vocals. Everything is well fused together. Great melodies, soothing moments, aggressive musics. We have a lot of great things in this album. An original sound, from my point of view. \n\nEven though it is not, in my opinion, as good as \"Fiction\" (that I consider to be the best album in the most recent years of Dark Tranquillity), it is a great quality jump from the \"We Are The Void\". This band should totally be in a Metal Hall Of Fame and this album would really give its contribute to it.\n",
        "\nTo fully understand and appreciate Dark Tranquillity is to understand their evolution as a band. It is indisputable that the 'classic' era of Dark Tranquillity is from Skydancer to The Mind's, I. An era that is riddled with spectacular guitar melodies and riffs, acoustic passages, poetic lyrics, fierce vocals that have merit, drumming that is centered on innovation rather than being a background metronome (Lars Ulrich and Ringo style). There are too many positive things to say about Dark Tranquillity\u2019s \u2018classic\u2019 era. However, they step out of their comfort zone and tackle a new monster in the second era of Dark Tranquillity with Projector and Haven. A monster that Construct echoes, and arguably amplifies. It\u2019s true that this monster wasn\u2019t perceived with open arms right off the bat. In fact, it had quite a bit of negative reactions from reviewers and fans alike - something Dark Tranquillity is not accustomed too \u2013 but it\u2019s safe to say that Projector and Haven have been gaining quite a bit of respect over the years from previous past ills. Now it\u2019s not uncommon to hear someone say that Projector is genius; an underrated classic. Afterwards we see Dark Tranquillity shed its skin just like a snake. Damage Done, Character, and Fiction stand side-by-side with the \u2018classic\u2019 era as \u201cPart 2 \u2013 Modern Day Classics\u201d.\n\nIn 2010, We Are The Void is and was the first of many leaps, rather than steps, into uncharted territory. By doing so, they released their most criticized album to date. However, We Are The Void, just like Projector, is strange and criticized heavily, but there is a good chance that it will be looked upon with positive opinions later on. Who knows? Life is always full of surprises. But it is important to look back on We Are The Void to fully understand the direction and ambition Dark Tranquillity is trying to grasp. That ambition and direction is hardly seen consistently in every other album prior to 2010 with the exception of Projector, and it\u2019s atmosphere. It\u2019s all about the atmosphere: dark, haunting, sporadic, ire filled, melancholic - if there\u2019s anything else you can petition by all means fill it in - but that is the general direction they\u2019ve been pursuing. Once listening and understanding the direction Dark Tranquillity is pursuing it becomes evident that Construct fits the album perfectly.\n\nFrom the very start of Construct Dark Tranquillity unleashes the beast with full force on \u201cFor Broken Words\u201d. This song sets up the precedent of what to expect from the rest of the album: melodic guitars (something to expect), slightly disturbing lyrics (matter of opinion, still cool though), progressive elements, and a solo section that focuses on emotions rather than shred (something Dark Tranquillity has always been none for), and most importantly an odd song structure. The follow up,\u201dThe Science of Noise\u201d, plays it safe but maintains the quality of enjoyment with \u201cclassic modern day\u201d elements [Dark Tranquility elements], which makes it look like a song that could have been seen in 2002-2007. Other songs that follow in the same footpath of \u201cThe Science of Noise\u201d are \u201cEndtime Hearts\u201d, \u201cThe Silence In Between\u201d, and \u201cApathetic\u201d. However, \u201cApathetic\u201d is a thrash-esque song that has a straightforward structure, and \u201cEndtime Hearts\u201d is just a flat out strange song\u2026 but it\u2019s amazing though\u2026 It has everything: the rage from Stanne, the quasi-pop chorus, the haunting pre-chorus, and a spectacular solo.\n\nAnother interesting region that Construct showcases are the 3 songs that amplify and echo Projector: \u201cState of Trust\u201d, \u201cUniformity\u201d, and \u201cWhat Only You Know\u201d. \u201cWhat Only You Know\u201d and \u201cState of Trust\u201d grasps the concept of inner struggles in oneself; however, both songs can be accused of being carbon copies of each other. Despite this, there is reason to detest that claim for each song is different and unique in tempo, mood, and atmosphere (melancholic), but the vocals are structured the same (verse = clean, chorus = harsh). As for \u201cUniformity\u201d, it\u2019s probably without a doubt the most difficult song to get into, mainly because of the its lethargic mood, repetitive guitar denouement, and the drum solo. It\u2019s an odd song, but any listener should give it time to grow on oneself.\n\nIn the past few albums, Dark Tranquillity has always concluded with a dark, atmospheric song. In Construct they deliver with just that, and more. Just like \u201cUniformity\u201d, \u201cNone Becoming\u201d requires a great deal of listens to fully appreciate, that difficulty was also seen in We Are The Void\u2019s \u201cIridium\u201d, but not in Fiction\u2019s \u201cThe Mundane And The Magic\u201d. \u201cNone Becoming\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a spectacular song based off of the first listen and there\u2019s nothing flashy about the song either. As I said before, one needs to give it time. In addition, Dark Tranquillity gives more to the listeners (who bothered with the bonus tracks). \u201cImmemorial\u201d could have easily taken the spot of \u201cNone Becoming\u201d as being the denouement of the album. There is vast wonder as to why it wasn\u2019t included on the album, for it stands as one of the strongest efforts on Construct. Lastly, there is \u201cPhoton Dreams\u201d. A song that is structured with nothing but dissonance. It\u2019s a shame actually, one can only wonder if they [the band members] could have expanded the song into some gem. Alas, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to realize that the dissonance limits the song writing process.\n\nIn conclusion, Construct has a great deal of things to offer. Whether it is in your face thrash (Apathetic), Gothic melancholy (State of Trust, What Only You Know), or even instant hits (The Science of Noise, Endtime Hearts); Construct has it all. Even if you may not be a fan of the entire album, there is however, at least one song everyone can enjoy. In addition, we should not ignore the progress of Dark Tranquillity\u2019s pursuit. We Are The Void and Construct are very similar when it comes to the general direction of experimenting with atmosphere, however, Construct perfects what We Are the Void failed to accomplish despite the mash-up of the different types of songs (thrash, gothic). Construct is just the construction of a new era in Dark Tranquillity\u2019s career, and it is nowhere as bleak as it was in 2010, rather it\u2019s anticipated with hope and excitement.\n\nAs a side note: We Are The Void would\u2019ve been better if they didn\u2019t write so many songs and just focused on improving/lengthening the guitar leads along with other melodies.\n\nRecommended Tracks:\nThe Science of Noise\nApathetic\nEndtime Hearts\nState of Trust\nImmemorial\nThe Silence In Between\n\n(Originally written for http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/57239/Dark-Tranquillity-Construct/ )\n",
        "\nHaving given this review a bit of a passing in light of how many times I've listened to Dark Tranquillity's catalog, I decided to dip my toe into sub-par albums this time around.\n\nWith what Mikael had said prior to the release of this album (\"While still bearing the unmistakable mark of the Dark Tranquillity, the record is probably our most different and diverse offering since 1999's Projector\"), the anticipation built to such heights that I almost wept when I heard this release for the first time. And I suspect they'll have lost a fair part of the fan base with it as well, or at least those who have ONLY listened to this album.\n\nWhy does this album warrant such a low percentage? They seem incapable of finding a running sound on this album. What they were playing is the saving light for this release, but the lyrics written to the guitars simply do not work. In any way. At all. This is exemplified on Apathetic, for he (Mikael) has clearly found that the past few releases hadn't contained enough uses of the word 'apathetic' or 'apathy' and decided to simply devote an entire 30 seconds to simply repeating one or the other, but I forget which and I dare not delve back in to find out which.\n\nOn the surface, this release isn't so much of a different concept to Fiction, Damage Done, or Character in that it changed their entire target audience from The Gallery and The Minds I, but this time they appear to have entirely alienated everyone who previously could claim themselves a fan.\n\nOn previous releases, Within the Void aside, DT held something that not many other bands in circulation could until now: consistency. They put out a string of above-par albums that could all in their own right be considered classics to some extent or another, be it Misery Crown on Fiction, Treason Wall on Damage Done, or Fabric on Haven. But Construct? It literally has no tracks that will stick and for that I'll score it the 10% I have.\n\nAll this negativity aside, this release does expose typical DT fans to perhaps more of the music they DO enjoy if they can simply rid themselves of the dramatics of how the lyrics are laid on top, as the very much commonplace guitar work hasn't left, but simply has been placed to one side to enable Mikael to take the band in a different direction.\n\nThat's largely the only reason this release warranted the 10/100 I gave.\n",
        "\nBeing this a release of a genre-defining legendary band, a review for this requires a bit of background first. I've been a fan of Dark Tranquillity since the time when they released Fiction, and back then I loved that album at first listen, and I'm still not tired of any of its songs (maybe the chorus of Terminus is the exception...). After that, I naturally looked forward to their back catalogue, and although I found some of their albums harder to get into, I ended loving them too. Even Skydancer. And Haven. It's because of Dark Tranquillity that I started loving complex music with cryptic lyrics. Then eventually came out We Are The Void. It was certainly an album that had almost everything that a DT fan would love. It was complex, there was a lot of melodies (it was probably the album with more \"dual guitar\" melodies since The Gallery), it had thought-provoking lyrics and it was still very much agressive and dark. But somehow strangely a lot of fans (me included) were a bit disappointed with it. The reason was simple: they sounded less DT than ever. That album contained less of that magic that characterized their music, and it had more outer influences in their sound. So does it mean that it was a bad album? Of course not. It was still a very good DT album, it was just that the expectations were too high, especially after Fiction.\n\nSo, that said, I was very excited when I heard that they were going to release a new album. And I was worried too, because I heard that the new album was more diverse and simple (even that there were no riffs!). I was also worried because of the cover art with the new logo and because of an image in the teaser that showed what seemed to be a paper with the list of the \"working titles\" for the songs, and all were names of other bands (this picture is also available on their official webpage).\n\nAnyways, after getting the limited edition and having listened to the whole thing more than 20 times in a week, I think that it's not one of their best recordings for sure. In part because of tracks like Uniformity, that have decent parts but somehow seem disharmonic when put together. Weight Of The End is a more classic track, but it's not my cup of tea, and it contains a little guitar melody that reminded me of In Flames (play the song at 0:50 to know what I mean). We also have here what seems Misery's Crown part III (Her Silent Language was part II), and it is called What Only You Know. It is cheesy as hell and here Stanne's clean vocals appear more processed than on previous albums. But the worst of all is, in my humble opinion, Endtime Hearts. It seems a song that Niklas Sundin composed after listening too much to Children of Bodom and/or Nother.\n\nNow let's focus on the good part. Songs like The Science Of Noise proves that it's not true that there were no riffs on this album. Then we have atmospheric-in-a good-way tracks like None Becoming, and although I didn't like it the first listens because it seemed like a poorer version of Iridium from WATV, it's a really a harmonic track. Apathetic caught me off guard. It's a kind of song I would never expect from DT. I was expecting something in the vein of Lost To Apathy in part because of a review I read before the release. Seriously, I'm not believing reviews from magazines anymore. This song turned out to actually be thrash metal with Stanne's vocals, nothing melodic. I'm sure this is the \"Kreator\" song of the list with the working titles for the album. I have to mention that this has the first real solo on the album, but I've never cared much of solos. The song is not bad at all, it just feels kind of alien being Dark Tranquillity.\n\nNow, let me analyze a bit deeper what I think is the best song here. The Silence In Between starts with piano notes over a drum and bass background and soon all instruments enters and the same piano melody is played in one guitar, while the other executes a more high-pitched, different but harmonic melody. The whole thing sounded familiar to me since the first time I listened to it until I realised that it reminded me of the way that some songs started in recent Amorphis albums. After the intro there is a typical Dark Tranquillity riff that leads to a catchy chorus, which by the way sounds very Amon Amarth-like. But that's forgivable since it fits very well with the rest of the song. Immediately after that comes a tremolo melody, and then everything is repeated before an echoed crystal guitar melody enters. Then the verse and chorus are repeated one last time and the song ends. Although the song structure is not very original and at times this track reminds of other bands, this is a very empowering melodic song as fans can expect from DT. Oh, and it feels short as hell.\n\nAbout the two bonus tracks on the Deconstruct CD in the limited edition, I think Immemorial is very good. I don't know what were they thinking when they decided not to include it in the regular version. It starts with a strange passage of sinister keyboards for half a minute and then it turns into a song full of melodies that are among the best of the whole album. And Photon Dreams is a decent, dark instrumental.\n\nThe lyrics on this album are more or less the same as in previous ones. I just noticed one change, more in content than in form. It seems like Stanne has finally fallen into apathy, fatalism and nihilism. And this is quite strange considering the lyrics on song like Misery's Crown, Lost To Apathy or The Fatalist among others were criticising those attitudes. In fact, when I saw the title of the song Apathetic i thought it was one of these songs. But no, it actually says \"Sometimes I feel what silence best describes, sometimes I feel apathetic to this life\". Another example are those lines from the song For Broken Words: \"Our words are broken, there is no value, there is no message, we give shelter to our false ideas\", which remind me of those from The Fatalist, but in that song said like an accusation to another person: \"Your thoughts are broken, your reasoning is flawed, defense is just an act, and lies are all you've got\". Also, here in the chorus of Uniformity we have those: \"We must come to terms, admit we are defeated, we must come to terms of bias and deception, stand out and be counted, in uniformity\".\n\nIt's worth mentioning that despite what some have said, this album is not at all like Projector. In fact Stanne only sings (clean) in three songs here. As many as in We Are The Void. It's also worth mentioning that this album was mostly composed by keyboardist Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m and lead guitarist Sundin, instead of guitarist and bassist (and until now main composer) Henriksson doing it. This explains the focus on more atmosphere and less riffs... which is not a bad thing at all, but seems that they didn't manage to do it properly. I hope next time they are doing it better.\n\nSo overall it's not a bad album, but I really think it's the weakest in DT's catalogue, because of trying to do something different and all those alien influences. And it's more simple. Maybe I'm one of these morons that don't want DT to change. But hey, this album is still a grower for sure, and it's still worth buying if you're a DT fan (specially the limited edition if you are from Europe).\n",
        "\nIt's that time again. Being one of the pioneers of melodic death metal and the only one that's still active and still relevant to the genre, everyone always anticipates Dark Tranquillity albums with bated breath; their 2000s albums in particular do people seem to hold as pillars of the melodeath sound. I want you to know going into this review that I'm not the biggest fan of that era of DT. My favorite albums have always been Projector and Haven, and I loved We Are the Void. In other words, the albums DT fans tend to dislike. I have always been more of a fan of Dark Tranquillity's more mellow, atmospheric or synth driven sound. Over time, the riffy aggressiveness that the typical fan loves about them has grown old and weary. We Are the Void in particular seems to get a lot of flak for this, something I can't fathom. The melodic, almost gothic vibe that permeates that album I really dig, and I hoped and expected them to continue that with the follow up.\n\nThey did, in fact, continue the We Are the Void concept. Construct is by all means an extension of that sound, though there are occasional excerpts taken from the multiple variations they've dabbled in throughout the years. This is surely atmosphere driven, and I predict the basic DT fanboy will be more annoyed by how restrained this album is in comparison to Character. Tracks \"For Broken Words,\" \"The Science of Noise,\" \"The Silence in Between,\" and \"Apathetic\" are akin to the classics Dark Tranquillity is known for; while this may seem promising, all of these except \"Apathetic\" are still more mood-driven than the typical thrashy DT number (note, for example, the acoustic sections in \"For Broken Words\"). Shamefully, \"Apathetic\" falls completely flat and I skip it almost every time.\n\nStanne's clean vocals show up in full force once again in (only) three of the ten songs: \"Uniformity,\" \"What Only You Know,\" and \"State of Trust;\" predictably, these stand above the others as the album's highlights. There is a bit of a Projector vibe especially in \"Uniformity\" (which reminds me of a more aggressive \"FreeCard\"). However, there is no peaking emotional ballad like \"Auctioned\" (one of the best songs they've ever done), and neither is there a borderline-progressive semi-epic like \"Nether Novas\" (still waiting for another one of those). Instead, \"What Only You Know\" and \"State of Trust\" again sound like something off We Are the Void - \"Her Silent Language\" in particular; neither of them are as compelling as that masterful composition, but they are by all rights great songs. \"State of Trust\" in particular rises above the others with almost poppy vocals and a gothic tinge.\n\nIn the win section is also \"None Becoming,\" which is deep and haunting, hypnotizing the listener with brooding synths. It's similar to \"Iridium\" before it, \"My Negation,\" and... well, it's the basic DT closer, and those are always great. Also of note is the bonus track \"Immemorial;\" it lacks the aggression one expects out of these guys, yet it's still in the \"heavy\" department and full of catchy riffs. They threw a bit of an oddball with this one, in fact, as it sounds more like the Finnish melodeath style than the Gothenburg style they do.\n\nThere is no denying Stanne has one of the best growls in the death metal business, and they add a certain hookiness to songs such as \"The Silence in Between.\" That said, I've always loved his clean singing even more; truly, his clean vox alone would rank him among my favorite vocalists. However, though his singing has become more refined with practice, I feel as though it lacks the emotional impact it once did in Projector. Either way, he's generally among Dark Tranquillity's highest selling points, and that hasn't changed here.\n\nThe problem with this album isn't the style. Instead, the songs seem to be missing an elusive something. Several songs feels like leftovers from the We Are the Void sessions that didn't make the cut, despite the three year gap between these albums and plenty of time to compose new tunes. Of the album's heavier tracks, there is no \"One Thought,\" \"Focus Shift,\" or Arkhangelsk;\" meanwhile, the album's balledesque tracks fall short as well. When compared to the highlights of their career, every song on this album underwhelms. This album lacks in moments that impress the way their past albums have, and that means the entire album lacks in staying power as a result. Instead, what we have is DT's most consistent album in years - though there's no huge highs, every song aside from aforementioned \"Apathetic\" is simply enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Construct is a solid album and a testament to Dark Tranquillity's consistency, despite falling short of the glory I expected. Admittedly, I like it more now than I did originally, so it is a bit of a grower and it may grow on me more yet. However, this album is about as restrained as Dark Tranquillity gets; if I, one of the only fans (I could be the only one) who wants more melody, less heavy out of DT finds this record at least slightly underwhelming, I can't imagine this album flying well with the your everyday, average Damage Done fanboy. Personally, I'm hoping they'll take one step further into the mellow side and start using cleans in almost every song again, just like in those good ol' Projector days.\n",
        "\nWhat has always set Dark Tranquility apart from almost every other melodic death metal band out there is their ability to create a bombastic and relentlessly incredible guitar experience that remains varied and considerably more adventurous than their comrades in the genre. Punish My Heaven, the introductory track to their magnum opus The Gallery, showed this off perfectly with its fantastic guitar introduction and the band's fan base remained quietly optimistic that following the masterful album The Gallery turned out to be, the band would release another album of the same caliber. Come 2007, six albums later, Dark Tranquility finally delivered with Fiction, an album that often rivals and at times eclipses The Gallery, standing out as a perfect example of how melodic death should sound.\n\nThe best thing about this album is the keyboard work provided by Martin Brandstrom. The keyboards are constantly there in the background creating a beautiful back drop and really toning up the melodic side to make the starkest contrast possible with the energetic and crushing riffs found such as in the song The Lesser Faith. The album opener Nothing To No One also showed off how well the keyboards could be used, as they do not rely on being overly flashy but are instead purely there to create a gorgeous backdrop for the rest of the band to build off and create an atmospheric masterpiece. There are times, such as at two and a half minutes into The Lesser Faith and especially the end of Misery's Crown where the keyboard comes to the forefront of the music which creates a fantastic dynamic for the band to play off, switching from the crushing and yet melodic brutality found throughout much of the duration of the album to something so soft. This is certainly an album that goes above and beyond what has come to be expected of the melodic death metal sub-genre since bands such as Arch Enemy bastardized it.\n\nThe guitar work on this album is once again absolutely top notch, although not quite as well written as that found on The Gallery, but not too far off. The riffs are fantastically crafted and flow into one another better than most albums out there, making for a rock solid album all the way through, and is also extremely varied. For those looking for tremolo picked death metal goodness and even a few seconds of a blast beat, Blind At Heart is for you, but the song also goes into absolute overkill on the melody during the chorus which is about as catchy and accessible as death metal gets. The soloing is what really stands out about the guitar work as Focus Shift shows off well among other songs. The soloing on here are, as should be expected from melo-death, not complete shred fests but instead focus on showing off the talent the guitarists have at creating something that sounds absolutely beautiful but at the same time completely chaotic. The soloing on here ranks among the best that has ever been produced from any album out there.\n\nThe drumming is highly varied, with some fast beats but usually it is a lot slower than what should be expected from a death metal album and fits in very well among the music. The double bass work on Blind At Heart is definitely the stand-out of the drumming on this album but it is all very well written and performed. The bass guitar is very low in the mix but is still audible enough and sounds very good, although following the guitars throughout. The pinch-harmonic fest that is the introduction to Icipher and the drums and bass-only opening to Nothing To No One are the stand-out moments for Michael Nicklasson. The vocal work is among the best in the genre, being fairly low in pitch but having a decent enough range with some higher, raspier shrieks to be found. This is one of the best vocal performances in melodic death metal and Mikael Stanne should be proud of his work on this album. The production is as tight as can be, with everything being audible throughout and no single instrument dominating the mix. The song craft is also of a high caliber but this is really an album of a great consistency as opposed to one that you pick a single song out of as being the best on here. If forced to pic, then opener Nothing To No One would be the best choice as it is a varied and thoroughly enjoyable song that everyone should experience.\n\nI recommend this album to anyone who enjoys melodic death metal as it is among the best in the sub-genre, but I would also recommend this to just about anyone looking for a fantastic album that is near perfect at everything it does. Dark Tranquility's 2007 outing is a flat-out classic of its genre and has some of the best sounding guitar work out there, on top of some brilliant vocal work and a consistency that is nearly unparalleled. This or The Gallery are Dark Tranquility's essential albums, and it is between the two as to which is better. Both are essential and you should listen to both.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity's 'The Gallery' and In Flames' mini album 'Subterranean' (also 1995) are two first slabs of Swedish melodic death metal I ever got to hear (and so-called Gothenburg metal, you know the story). I was hooked, to put it mildly. Both of them being great classics nowadays, many times more or less mimiced, never truly outdone. At least not in my world of metal. Melodic death metal genre itself might be seen lame by those who want the brutalest of brutal, yet the genre is no less metal at its best. Those were the days...\n\nMetal as fuck is what this is. This might be no perfect combination of melodies and brutality, because this is outdone in both fields, but this is a very individual one. The melodiousness plays bigger role on 'The Gallery'. Both guitarists play a lot of lead guitar, maybe even more than just rhythm riffing. Substantial, meandering of compositions might be blinding at first, but I believe, that hooks that are thrown at listener at high velocity should easily sink deep into brain. Tempos change from slow heaviness to fast speed blast beating, like roller coasters. While the songs are shorter when compared to the debut ('Skydancer' from 1993), they also are much tighter yet more crammed. Changes from calm acoustics into tornado-like, listener-spinning attacks are not a rarity on this album. These all sound like they are thoroughly thought out, so well is this music composed. One big part of this are folk elements (maybe some baroque, too), playing vital role here, as well as Nordic melancholy. Dark Tranquillity is not so death metally, though. They perform metal, taking a lot influences from many subgenres (heavy, speed etc.). While being down to earth, somehow this sounds otherworldly at times, too, granting one of the greatest listening experiences for me, ever. There's some keyboards, but they're well done and do not bring anything down. The lyrics are poetic, and so is the music.\n\nGuys' playing is great, for sure. Everybody is everywhere for a great deal of time yet the band knows the power of simplicity and use it, if rather seldomly. Lately I've found this \"virtuosity without showing off\" a bloody great thing (like Helloween, for example). Very playful yet comprehensible for me, who only hits skins. Interplay of the guitarists Fredric Johansson and Niklas Sundin is seamless. The bassist Martin Henriksson and the drummer Anders Jivarp provide tight basis, which at same time is also experimental. The sound is good for it's time and every instrument is well heard. It is quite heavy, thanks to rhythm crew, since guitars are usually playing higher notes. Michael Stanne's (also did vocals for In Flames debut album 'The Lunar Strain' [1994]) vocals are brutal. His malevolent growl is truly individual one, more theatrical than before and easily recognizable. A few lines of clean singing is heard, a nice touch and also very individual. Female vocals, which are used on a few songs, are bloody powerful. Lyrics are anything from personal to universal, every listener can make one's own conclusions. Kristian W\u00e5hlin's cosmic cover art is the final plating on this album full of most precious metal.\n\nIn the past I seemed to think, that the first five songs are the best and after those, some less excellent music was heard. Longer I experienced the album, more wonderful it sounds throughout. Be that as it may, it is a rare occasion when I've heard an album beginning with such a powerful quintet. 'The Gallery' is an infinite classic. Every metal music fan should check this album out, without any prejudices for this maybe being \"un-metal\" like a lot of today's Gothenburgers.\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2003)\n",
        "\nIt was difficult to avoid noticing the sharp decline in quality material coming out of the older guard of the melodic death metal genre by the time the 2000s had come to be. One need not venture much further than the absence of At The Gates and the detestable studio misfire that was \"Reroute To Remain\" to see that the big names that pioneered the Gothenburg sound had faltered, save the 3rd part of the triumvirate in Dark Tranquillity. While it could be effectively argued that even said band's best days were behind them by 2002, the album that is \"Damage Done\" rests pretty comfortably on a higher level than even the album that influenced it most in \"Slaughter Of The Soul\". It effectively utilizes the same winning formula of catchy melodic hooks, driving thrash riffs and solid rock grooves, and the old fashioned principle of songwriting that less is more that was all over At The Gates' heavily criticized final offering, only it closes the deal more effectively by sticking to the foundational aspects of the style and avoiding too much peripheral detailing.\n\nIn essence, this album represents the mirror opposite of what was on the agenda in the early 90s when the style was first starting to take shape, opting for a cohesive, rock solid sound rather than a diffused mixture of technical playing. It is completely removed from the high speed flash and low-fidelity obscurity that marked the early masterworks in the Swedish scene that still had traces of the parallel black metal sound in the mix, coming off as a sound with more in common with traditional heavy/power metal. With this sort of direction comes a high level of accessibility that normal detracts from the core fan base of extreme metal, but it works far better here than with In Flames because Mikael Stanne's vocal work maintains that darker, deeper barking quality drawn from the older Stockholm sound. Even when listening to the near sing-along anthems drenched catchy themes and consonant keyboard lines that are \"Monochromatic Stains\" and \"Format C For Cortex\", the character of the album is dark and forbidding due to the werewolf tinged growls covering the foreground.\n\nThe downside of an album like this is pretty obvious; whenever the catchy factor is the chief drive of an album, it usually comes at the expense of variety or development of ideas. This is a collection of songs in the same sense that early Saxon might put together a collection of songs, with no songs hitting the 5 minute mark or spending too much time outside of the typical verse/chorus format. This is compensated for with a driving sense of energy and a dense atmosphere, resulting in a set of songs that sate one's hunger for variety through variations in texture and slight change ups in pacing. Certain numbers such as \"Final Resistance\" and the title song \"Damage Done\" fire the guns in typical death/thrashing fashion, and while they don't attempt to match the sheer fury of the bulk of \"Crowned In Terror\", they prove to be formidable in their own right and showcase the interesting duality of melancholy and rage that defines a good Gothenburg album. Even when crossing into lighter territory as on \"The Enemy\", this album's closest thing to a ballad proves to be rougher and darker than the bulk of In Flames' later 90s work.\n\nThe prospective newcomer to melodic death metal will find this to be one of the best entry points, especially if approaching it from a vantage point where little extreme metal has been on the menu beyond the earliest works of Death and Morbid Angel. The amount of commonality that it shares with mainline heavy metal gives it an appeal that would be fit for the arena if it were not for the toneless vocals and dark themes, and at the same time it manages to surprise at a few key points, particularly when the keyboards make a few brief appearances on equal footing with the guitars. But more than anything else, it's the sort of album that will be difficult to get out of one's head once its nestled itself in, and it takes little time for the infectious melodies and smooth atmospherics to overpower the ears once they've started. It may not be death metal in the strict sense of the style, but it kills with a similar degree of mastery.\n",
        "\n6 members creating this album, and my God, what a follow-up from their previous release entitled Character. They use a lot of electronics on here, but it doesn't drown out the melodic riffs. The vocals are not really varied, they're mostly just screaming, which was different than their epic release back in 1999 with Projector. I got used to that album and deem it higher than Fiction. I like the variety on the vocal aspect of that release.\n\nEvery song on here deserves praise. They're totally original sounding. Guitar wise it's varied with chord progressions, somewhat fast tempos, some tremolo picked riffing but not much, mostly just purely melodies. They didn't abandon their roots on this release and it's a little more aggressive and anger stricken than what I wasn't used to on Projector. I don't own Character, so I can't really make any comparisons to that one compared to this.\n\nLong songs clocking in 4-5 minutes in length for a total of about 45+ minutes in length. Well played out melodic death metal. The only beef I have with the album are the solos. I don't think that they were very good. But there weren't many on here. Mostly rhythm guitar which is very good. The quality in the riffs are what stands out the most. Even some blast beating is featured here on the drums. They were very angry on this album. It's not really mellow at all.\n\nI think that the electronics created more of a darker atmosphere for the music which was the band's aim was on this album. Their lyrical concepts consist of death, memories, despair and chaos theory. Quite a lot of topics there and creative to the core. If they took out the lead guitar on this album and made it all rhythms, then I would give the album a higher rating. But the reality is that their guitarists play great guitar, just not leads.\n\nThe production was impeccable. All of the instruments are well heard on here. The guitars, electronics, bass, drums, and vocals are well mixed into this release. Nothing is left out here. Total quality from all aspects. No complaints at all on here in terms of the mixing and production. Just a great melodic death album overall. Great atmosphere they have on here. Dark, melodic, aggressive and quality in musicianship.\n\nIf you're a melodic death freak like I am, this is a must have for your collection. It's only lacking on the lead department, but the melodies, the electronics, piano, riffs, and vocals are all good. They didn't lose their aggressiveness in their songwriting at all. They progressed on here and what stands out the most to me is how well they're able to incorporate piano/electronics in together and not drown out the vocals or drums. As I previously stated, the mixing is phenomenal. Pick this one up!\n",
        "\nThe seventh son of the pioneering Gothenburg metallers arrived some weeks ago. My initial impressions were something like \"another good DT album, but still the same old DT\". Like, one thumb up. Okay, I've always picked up a new DT album when it has hit the shelves, and never was I really disappointed. But I seriously gotta stop believing, that a new album will dethrone the band's decade-old classic 'The Gallery' (1995).\n\nOkay, I cleansed myself of the huge expectations and started to listen to the album instead. DT sound vigorous and angrier than for some platters, at least since 'The Mind's I' (1997). 'Character' has a live vibe. It's in-yer-face affair and that fills some of the gaps created by at times lacklustre songwriting, clearly heard on 'One Thought' (okay, its solo part rules!) and 'Senses Tied' which aren't able to surprise even a single bit. I see \"Gothenburg metal\" as an alloy of thrash and death metal fundamentally, then stacked with loads of melody, so that it mutates into something different again. The present trend pop does not, luckily, raise its ugly head here. On 'Character', the band have revisited their own history from 1995 to 2002, which of course is a big source. There is not every trick utilized here, e.g. the clean vocals are missing again. The guitar work includes 'The Gallery' style stuff, which I absolutely want to hear more, but also some straight \"rock\" stuff. The band hit their fastest here, I believe, but fluently changing the pace throughout the album. 'Character' has two sides on it: It can be viciously angry, but also enchantingly inviting, so it is very well balanced indeed. The album's bening characteristic is its way to open up quite slowly, thanks to its quite curvy song material.\n\nOne can expect a lot of riffs and fantastic memorable leads. At times the guitars are surprisingly ripping. The drumming is pounding and full of nice tricks. Synths aren't as sweet anymore, which is a good thing in my ears. Now there's more electro stuff, but also good old piano and such. The synths have slightly smaller part on 'Character' when compared to a few older albums, but it's more planned. Generally, it can be heard, that the band had joy recording the album. The Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m production is, above all, organic. Human touch is left intact, even though the sound is clean. Good balancing between instruments is the icing over it. Vocals are more or less brutal dry throat abuse, definitely individual. Plus for the comprehensible pronunciation despite the inhuman vocal style. The lyrics are usually very personal and I'm not one to comment them, except to say that they are well written.\n\nSomething about the packaging and extras, then. The digipak looks fantastic with its chaotic, futuristic art and embossed cardboard. Booklet's cover art soothes my eyes, thanks to its dystopia theme. The booklet's other art is surprisingly good as it's done with a computer. Someone can still conjure up some fine computer art, thankfully. The digipak version's extras includes multimedia videos. 'Lost to Apathy' video clip is usual stuff, showing the band playing the song, but there's nice stuff towards the end which I don't want to reveal. Four live pieces have bad picture quality, thanks to the compression (face features can't be discerned). The sound's okay.\n\n'Damage Done' (2002) showed that there was still life in the band. During the recording of 'Character', Dark Tranquillity had some extra energy, which is finely utilized, except making the album a tad too long. 'Character' is modern and therefore it lacks the mysteriousness of 'The Gallery'. However, if the band have meant something good to you in the past, why not try 'Character'?\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2005)\n",
        "\nIf there is one point in Dark Tranquillity\u2019s early releases where the actual face of their well known melodeath sound revealed itself, it\u2019s this rather short and sadly, flawed EP. All of what was going to become clich\u00e9 about the style begin to fall into place, though a remnant of the early 80s thrash character of the Septic Broiler days still manages to keep itself attached to the band. In fact, apart from the chaotic blast sections which hint a bit more at a Morbid Angel influence, these songs are pretty well in line with the \u201cHuman\u201d influences that were also heard on \u201cTrail Of Life Decayed\u201d.\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor that holds \u201cA Moonclad Reflection\u201d bad a bit is the lackluster production, which finds an imbalanced mix job with a overly reverb drenched drum and vocal presence that obscures a lot of the other things going on. Particularly on \u201cUnfurled By Dawn\u201d the raucous snare hit (further sustained by the reverb additives) works against a lot of the fairly impressive riff work going on, and even a set of Schuldiner inspired lead lines find themselves struggling to be heard. Frid\u00e9n\u2019s vocals, while still fairly close to the early death metal standard accomplished earlier, is becoming a bit more whisper-like, which definitely leaves him a bit exposed when factoring in the mixture of studio effects at work.\n\nThe other song \u201cYesterworld\u201d works a bit better in this capacity because it doesn\u2019t spend as much time in a frenzy of high tempo drum sections and tremolo riffs, but even here there is a bit of an obscurity factor that works against what is otherwise an excellent song. The acoustic guitar lines that occasionally chime in are apparent enough, but robbed of their depth, and the Iron Maiden inspired lead guitar melodies that chime in at key points are the only element that is free of being buried under a barrage of drum noise, mostly because they occur when the drums have settled down a bit.\n\nWhile definitely the weakest of the early offerings before \u201cSkydancer\u201d, this is still unique enough of a release to be worth checking into if a historical perspective is high on your radar. The trappings of the melodeath sound are definitely here, though they are still somewhat at war with the older, archaic sound of the late 80s. It\u2019s a listen that is governed by a duality of serene beauty and chaotic ugliness, though the latter has the edge, and definitely reveals itself as a sort of rebellious force in a style that was beginning to define itself by employing ugliness and leaving little room for the band\u2019s namesake, ergo tranquility.\n",
        "\nThe early days of melodeath are a curious phenomenon, largely because they are all but joined at the hip with the death/thrash character of the American pioneers of the style, drawing just as much from images of coldness and darkness as from the clich\u00e9 themes of gore and insanity. With the advent of acts such as Cannibal Corpse and a few others, the various sub-groups of death metal became more obsessed with the vomit inducing side of the lyrical paradigm, and with it came a much more brutal and barebones approach to the style. But the more spiritual side of the coin stayed a bit closer to the thrash roots of the archetypical founders, at least during the early 90s, and one very clear example of this is the first demo under the Dark Tranquillity name that is \u201cTrail Of Life Decayed\u201d.\n\nWhile the name of the band had changed, there is still a good amount of commonality between this work and the \u201cEnfeebled Earth\u201d demo under the Septic Broiler moniker. The melodic trappings of the early thrash scene and the largely Teutonic thrash character of the pacing and riff work is still largely present, though dressed up with a larger production that goes even heavier on the reverb, and also introduces some keyboard and acoustic guitar elements to spice up the arrangement. The intro \u201cMidwinter\u201d and the closing seconds of \u201cVoid Of Tranquillity\u201d provide much of the atmospheric additives in question, but even during the bone crushing thrash sections of the bulk of these songs, or the blasting madness of Beyond Enlightenment\u201d which ventures outside of the early Death paradigm, the vocal elements hint at a denser, less 80s sounding character that is definitely seeking another level outside of what Kreator had been doing up till this point.\n\nAs with the Septic Broiler material, this is hinting at the typical Gothenburg sound that would come later, but is still much closer to the thrash metal character of the likes of Death, in fact, the occasional keyboard chime-ins are fairly reminiscent to some of the material that was found on \u201cHuman\u201d at around this time, though the character of the meat and potatoes of these songs hints a bit closer to Nocturnus. Suffice to say, there\u2019s a fair amount going on here, including a rather impressive display of gut wrenching barks and vile mutterings out of Anders Frid\u00e9n that seem really out of character for him when also considering the bulk of the work he did with In Flames (even and including their monumental achievement with him \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d).\n\nIt is understandable why some might consider it odd that this demo is readily included amongst Dark Tranquillity\u2019s discography but \u201cEnfeebled Earth\u201d, but actually when given the commonality that this shares with \u201cThe Key\u201d and \u201cSoulside Journey\u201d, it\u2019s a good bit closer to their characteristic sound. It\u2019s a subtle distinction, and ultimately this doesn\u2019t quite present the paradigm shift that was going on in the Swedish scene in as blatant of a fashion as what would emerge a couple years later. This is something that could probably be more readily appreciated by death/thrash fans than those who\u2019ve grown accustomed to this style sounding like mid 90s In Flames, but both groups should definitely check it out if they haven\u2019t already.\n",
        "\nWhen melodic death is played right, it comes in the form that Dark Tranquillity plays here on this \"Projector\" release. A big Depeche Mode influence that Mikael Stanne portrays in his vocal efforts. Of course there's variety, he mixes clean vocals with raspy ones according to the music. When you hear the clean guitar bits, he's singing in a very melodic tone. I can say that he actually sings with such passion. He does mix clean vocals also with the distorted guitars by Fredrik Johansson and Niklas Sundin. There's a female vocalist that contributes some to this release as well by the name of Johanna Andersson. What an outstanding voice!\n\nThe songs are true melodic death to the core. There's a mixture of clean tone guitars like I previously mentioned mixed with heavier melodic riffs. The songs themselves are so well played to perfection. There are not really many guitar solos, just an array of melodies that are so amazing it's captivating to hear. Mikael's vocals augments the guitars and piano as well. Talk about an amazing vocalist! Well he has so much variety it's unbelievable.\n\nEvery single song on here deserves mention. None of them were half-assed or unskilled. This band really hit a gemstone which \"Projector\" is. The metal really flows and the clean vocals almost outweighs the hoarse tone. Don't expect anything too fast on here because it's just not here. Each track is slow paced and even one song called \"Day To End\" features a heavy synthesizer that dominates the track along with the clean vocals.\n\nDark Tranquillity copies no one on \"Projector\", it stands alone in sheer dynamite. Especially with melodic death freaks like me, it never grows old. An album that was so well mixed, nothing is left out. All of the instruments are heard and heard with vigor. The crunch tone distortion from the guitars features riffs that are original and innovative. No weak points on any of the songs.\n\nThis band really was creative in this offering and probably in my opinion their best work, surely surpassing \"The Minds I\" for sure. I'd have to say that it surpassed both older and newer releases by far. Amazing work by all musicians in terms of the songwriting. A true Gothenburg band that surpasses all of what I've heard from this band. If you want true melodic death metal the way that it should be played, pick up \"Projector\" because there aren't any albums that feature this highest standard of musicianship whatsoever.=\n",
        "\nThe first Dark Tranquillity album I listened to was Fiction, which I greatly enjoyed so I decided to go back in time to their first album, Skydancer. \n\nAt first glance, Skydancer reminds me of In Flames' early work, but less refined and less polished. The similarity to In Flames becomes obvious when one checks the lineup and finds that the vocals are performed by Anders Friden, Mikael Stanne performing backing vocals and guitar at this point.\n\nI'd describe Skydancer as being \"proto-melodeath.\" The music, although good, and in the case of \"Shadow Duet,\" great, sounds very experimental, as if they're still attempting to polish and refine their sound. Throughout the entire album the band uses accoustic guitars, clean vocals, and on \"A Bolt of Blazing Gold,\" female vocals. All of these are basically inserted onto a melodeath framework to see how they work together. And for the most part, it all fits together nicely if one ignores the production and seemingly prototypical sound.\n\nDespite this the album does have several highlights. In my opnion the best songs on the album are \"Shadow Duet,\" and \"A Bolt of Blazing Gold.\" \"Shadow Duet,\" is a duet performed by Anders Friden and Mikael Stanne, but if it didn't have the word \"duet\" in the title, the average listener would just assume its one or the other. The problem is that Friden and Stanne's vocals are too similar to be distinguashable from one another. On \"A Bolt of Blazing Gold,\" the band experiments with using backing female vocals,. These are pleasing to the ear, but they also seem somewhat out of place during the portions ofhe song that they're featured on.\n\nMusically, there's nothing really new or innovating other than the bands style. The guitars play both accoustic melodies and more fast paced almost early death/thrash metal sounding riffs. The drums don't do anything special either. The main problem with the bands playing at this point in their career is that they haven't really defined themselves yet, they're still trying to decide what kind of style they're going to play.\n\nSkydancer is a decent album but it's nothing special. It's fun to listen to especially if you want to hear what the band sounded like in their early days.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity is one of those bands that were pioneers of so-called Gothenburg sound. The original idea was to combine death metal with melodies. Dark Tranquillity has released great albums during their career and at the same time made some changes in their sound on every album. Now it's time to find out what did this band sound on their first record.\n\n\nSkydancer is energetic and melodic death metal. The catchy riffs bring the melodic side of the album as Anders Frid\u00e9n's vocals and some aggressive drumming bring the brutal side. The tracks are quite straightforward and the band seems to master their own style. There are also some experimental elements like female vocals and acoustic guitars. To me, they create more depth in the music. Sometimes the tracks are fast-driven but luckily they sometimes slow down for the atmospheric parts. The biggest experiments the band had have left on their demos. The material can't be compared to their modern material, but there are still some nice tracks. The album misses the last touch and the climatic parts. The production is quite weak. It would have been better if the sounds were sharper.\n\n\nSkydancer shows a band full of energy. There are things that would have been made a better way, like the production and sound, but this album was still a good start for this band. The members at least had fine musicianship so it isn't a wonder how they have evolved to this day. The thing that also raises the value of this release is that this album must have sounded much better when it was originally released.\n",
        "\nFrom their back catalogue of releases, you could be mistaken for thinking they'd have forgotten how to perform some of their previous masterpieces, you would be WRONG, from Freecard off the Projector album right through to Misery's Crown from Fiction, you can feel the emotion pumped into this release, the gratitude, the pride, each song different, each song equal to one another in how much of a classic they are, whether you're a fan of all the albums, or just the one, this live compilation caters for all.\n\nFrom the beginning of The Treason Wall through to Terminus, both the track, and end of the album, you would need to be either tone deaf, or simply not a fan of this band to appreciate half of the tracks, as this is by far the best live album you will ever need to buy, phenomenal in every sense of the word; 90 minutes of the best live music you will ever hear, either at a gig or otherwise.\n\nFor sheer nostalgia, they appear to have covered at least something off every album, perfectly, so for fans of old or new DT, they won't disappoint, especially their live version of Misery's Crown, which is every bit the equal to any song they've previously released, and in light of their latest album, ever going to release.\nThroughout this album, you may hear the off note, or imagine as such, just to pick fault with it, but this release is perfection in a live album, which is in turn a compilation of some of their greatest hits; a must have.\n\nMikael seems incapable of doing wrong, especially with this release under his belt, especially with the band he has behind him; if Mikael got any better, he would be an X-man.\n",
        "\nAfter 2007\u2019s very impressive Fiction, Dark Tranquillity seemed to have reached a culmination of the modern sound that they had adopted ever since 2002\u2019s equally solid Damage Done. This sound revolves around a very well-produced, keyboard-based and extremely catchy variation of the traditional melodic death metal they had been playing since their beginnings. They were basically on top of the world with that sound, and had to find a way to adapt it for the next chapter of their existence: We Are The Void. And, I\u2019m afraid to say, We Are The Void is a major letdown as an album, with too much filler and too much inconsistency. That said, the album has a core of five godly tracks which redeem it from being a complete trainwreck to being a strategically enjoyable album. \n\nOn the surface, this album is deceptively similar to its predecessor. Pretty much the same elements are there, but their arrangement is what causes most problems. The guitar playing is essentially the same, with the exception of a somewhat greater number of solos involved, which unfortunately seem pretty out-of-place on the album due to the simple fact that they\u2019re not compatible with the new Dark Tranquillity sound: the guitar playing sometimes comes out at the forefront of the sound with relatively technical riffs and solos but without the songwriting context to make them seem good. It\u2019s like the band decided to add some more technical stuff to make a more \u201cmetal\u201d album without adapting the whole structure to the changes. And that\u2019s what we get in pretty much all of the weaker tracks: the keyboards are neglected for more traditional metal instruments, which would be fine with most bands but new Dark Tranquillity lives and breathes keyboards; it\u2019s the only thing, along with Mikael\u2019s vocals, that makes the band truly unique.\n\nThe result is an utterly dry and misplaced sound on many tracks, including the first two: Shadow in Our Blood and Dream Oblivion, which sound like parodies of previous aggressive tracks from around the Character era. The choice of production does little to help here, with everything being tuned quite low. The title track is perhaps the greatest offender, in that it\u2019s the most aggressive track here, and should be good, but isn\u2019t because it sounds generic as hell. The keyboards are almost left out and some simplistic chugging riffs drive the music, with disastrous results. The drumming is competent throughout the album, but often contributes to that feeling of extreme dryness in the sound that plagues the more fast-paced tracks. \n\nThat was the bad part. However, there\u2019s fortunately also a good part: the five consecutive godly tracks, starting with the epic The Fatalist and culminating with the sublime Her Silent Language. The very first seconds of The Fatalist are a sign of things to come: beautiful piano-imitating keyboard strokes that are a perfect sound to accompany the rest of the song, turning an otherwise ordinary track into a masterpiece. This sound culminates in the extremely epic and memorable chorus, where Mikael\u2019s harshest of harsh vocals really work well to create a contrast with the soft, very melodic keyboard lines. This is the missing element that ruins the other songs and that makes these five incredibly good. This is the element that makes Dark Tranquillity what they are today, love it or hate it, and they lose the uniqueness of their sound without it! Similar patterns are at work on the following triad of songs, making each one of them excellent, if not necessarily that different from one another. \n\nThe last song in this streak of excellence is Her Silent Language, and it\u2019s basically the album\u2019s ballad. Continuing where Misery\u2019s Crown left of, it greatly improves upon it. Mikael\u2019s clean vocals here are simply perfect, creating one of the most powerful atmospheres when contrasted with the harsh vocals of the chorus; the keyboard lines work to seal the deal of what is undoubtedly the best Dark Tranquillity ballad and probably the best track on this album (The Grandest Accusation is close). Even the solo here is good, not suffering from the delusions of technical grandeur that others (Shadows in Our Blood) seem to have. It works perfectly with the rest of the song\u2019s elements, notably the omnipresent keyboards. \n\nEven the keyboards aren\u2019t used perfectly, however, as the disappointing Arkhangelsk reveals: it begins with a wonderful keyboard line that promises another great song, but then loses itself in a mess of harsh yells and a go-nowhere structure. This song just tries to be extremely heavy while being slow and it kind of fails. Surface the Infinite is another attempt at making a song like the good part mentioned above, but the guitars are slightly misused here, resulting in a decent but not great track (the solo is good though). The pace is a bit too slow for what it tries to accomplish and seems a bit plodding. The same can be said of Iridium, which tries to be very epic but just crashes and burns as a nearly seven-minute bore fest that pretty much sounds alike from beginning to end. \n\nWe Are The Void could have been such a powerful album, but it\u2019s plagued by massive amounts of filler and so many incoherent ideas that it turned out to be the band\u2019s weakest in at least a decade. However, at the core it has five tracks which represent the very best of modern Dark Tranquillity, so no fan of the era can simply ignore this. What could have been a perfect EP has been turned into a mediocre album.\n",
        "\nThings seem to be getting a little bit complicated. As a Dark Tranquillity fan, I usually get somewhat frustrated while reviewing underwhelming releases by these guys. After \u201cFiction\u201d, many fans (including myself) probably thought (or hoped) the Swedish sextet would once again try to reinvent their sound, but alas, it didn\u2019t happen. \u201cWe are The Void\u201d, their 2010 release, is strange album that takes some time to fully appreciate. First, let\u2019s go through the bad aspects of their most recent output.\n\nAt first listen, it may sound like a slightly more hollow-sounding version of \u2018Character\u2019, but the fault should not fall entirely in the band\u2019s hands. The production is similar to Fiction\u2019s; thin-sounding and kind of sterile, probably made to augment the natural metallic sound of the B-tuned guitars. For those who are still not familiar with such tuning, well, it\u2019s low. Low enough to force newcomer bassist Daniel Antonsson to play almost nothing but boring root notes (and at a very low volume), lest the whole thing become and unbearable mush of growly, bottom-end sounds. I\u2019m aware that after \u201cThe Mind\u2019s I\u201d, this band kind of forced the bass guitar into playing a weaker role, but I expected things would be different with the new bassist. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. \n\nSundin and Henriksson do their thing once again as they\u2019ve been doing for the past decade. They play Gothenburg riffs (sometimes interspaced with tremolo riffing), some vaguely thrash-sounding passages, some Maiden melodies and that\u2019s pretty much it. Anders\u2019 drumming is still competent, but it lacks flair and variation. It\u2019s like he\u2019s playing because he needs to, and not because he\u2019s enjoying every minute of what\u2019s being played. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking too much, but the man is a good drummer and I wish he could show more excitement or variation.\n\nMartin attempts to mix the styles he used in \u2018Character\u2019 (more inspired by electronic music) and \u2018Fiction\u2019 (more organic, classical) to varying degrees of success, and Mikael\u2019s vocals \u2013 by far my favorite aspect of this band \u2013 seem to be showing signs of weakness. While still not bad, his voice is far from the great performance showcased on Damage Done, Character and Fiction; also, distortion effects are being used at some parts to augment an aggression his natural technique seems to be unable to sustain any further, which is sad for a singer that is usually pointed as one of the best of this subgenre. Clean vocals are also back, which fortunately is a plus because Mikael has a beautiful tone.\n\nHowever, despite this lengthy rant, \u201cWe Are the Void\u201d still has enough redeeming values to please Dark Tranquillity fans. While \u201cFiction\u201d received some flak for its overall lack of interesting lead guitar parts, WATV makes up for it by having both guitarists play varied and interesting solos in almost every song; of course its no Tipton and Downing, but its good for what its worth. \n\nOpener \u201cShadow in our Blood\u201d begins with an ominous (yet unnecessarily distorted) bass line that segues into your standard Gothenburg fare (Or did you expect anything different?). I kinda dig the little scale descent at 0:57, the solo is cool enough (should be a tad longer, in my opinion) and the chorus is acceptable. This first song somewhat represents what the album means to me: it\u2019s good and very well-played, but it\u2019s not a graceful atmospheric rocker like \"The Lesser Faith\" nor it grabs you by the balls like \"The New Build\".\n\nDark Tranquillity is a band that simply cannot be led to run on autopilot or set a standard and stay in it forever. This band\u2019s entire career is based on the fact that they always found a way to reinvent their sound; THIS is what makes them so special. What I see here is stock-standard DT fare, strong and competent, but not interesting enough. There\u2019s no suspense, there\u2019s no \"Oh, what the hell they\u2019re going to do next?\" (Like we\u2019ve experienced on Projector, for an example), it\u2019s just \"Riff one, riff two, Atmospheric/Solo break, Chorus, rearrange everything and ok guys, next song!\" This is not the Dark Tranquillity I\u2019ve come to respect and admire.\n\nOf course, however, this album is not devoid of good ideas and some spark of interesting songwriting. \u201cThe Fatalist\u201d, for an example, is a very strong song with a great verse and powerful, fist-pumping chorus that will become a live staple in no time, and \u201cSurface the Infinite\u201d gets the \u2018best chorus\u2019 prize here. Listen to the beautiful melody underlying it and try not to sing along. Also, this song features Stanne\u2019s best performance on the album, check out how he briefly returns to his \u201cDamage Done\u201d roars at 3:06.\n\n\u201cArkhangelsk\u201d and \u201cIridium\u201d are odd songs focused on atmosphere. The first one tries a little bit too much to be a successor to \u201cInside the Particle Storm\u201d, probably due to its gloomy, dark nature. Thumbs up to Stanne here, the man sounds like a doomsayer on crack and it works wonderfully. The latter is slightly more boring but once again benefits from Mikael\u2019s riveting, spine-tingling vocals and a good chorus.\n\nAnother reviewer noted a resemblance between \u201cHer Silent Language\u201d and Fiction\u2019s \u201cMisery\u2019s Crown\u201d, and I agree. Both follow a very similar structure and have a poppish feeling, especially with those lyrics. Could be a much greater song, but it\u2019s dragged down by an overly simplistic build-up, despite its relaxing lead work and Mikael\u2019s great cleans.\n\nHowever, the best song is undoubtedly \u2018I Am The Void\u2019. Holy shit, if the whole album was like this I would be going nuts. It just grabs you and doesn\u2019t let go until the very last note !\n\nBeginning with an attention-grabbing thrash riff, it then goes into this album\u2019s most interesting Gothenburg riff/Tremolo transition and all of a sudden Sundin and Henriksson remember how to make an interesting staccato section again; being rhythmically significant and highlighted by the keyboard work, it doesn\u2019t become a throbbing mess. \u201cI am the call, I speak inside of you!\u201d Stanne says with a more subdued and sinister growl on the chorus. After the second chorus, the staccato riff comes back briefly and offers a little suspense, then greeting us with an excellent and very well placed solo section, and then it thought \u201cOk, now they\u2019re going into one of those boring electronic, guitar-less breaks and it will completely crack the song\u2019s flow\u201d only to have the thrash riff come back suddenly and punch me in the face. Now WHY can\u2019t they write more songs like that? This is true Dark Tranquillity, and not boring, overly keyboard-driven stuff like \u201cAt the Point of Ignition\u201d.\n\nWhile it may seem that I hated this album, it is not the case. I still hold much respect for these Swedes and I just hope they can come back with a more interesting output next time. Dark Tranquillity must realize the fact that they\u2019re loved not just because of their near-flawless chops, but also because of their soul and inventive character. This group is capable of renewing its sound like few others can, so it is sad when such a great skill is not put to good use.\n\nOptimistically speaking, a lackluster but good album is still a good album, unless of course they decide to sit down and keep writing the same thing over and over again, which will erase any positive outlook even from the most diehard fans. Let\u2019s all hope for the best.\n\nHighlights; \"I Am The Void\", \"The Fatalist\", \"Surface the Infinite\", the chorus and solo section to \"In My Absence\".\n",
        "\nThis is the first Dark Tranquility album I ever bought, and it's also one of the best metal albums I've ever bought. This is the definition of a fantastic album and it's definitely one of my favorites.\n\nThis entire album has a real forlorn feel to it; there's almost a sense of film-noir jazz about it, particularly in the opening seconds of Inside the Particle Storm. There's just a laid back feel to it that's hard to describe, as the music itself isn't laid back. It's just a sort of...cool, almost relaxed atmosphere throughout this whole album.\n\nThe music itself is chock full of sharp riffs, fantastic drumming (this album has some of my favorite drumming on it) terrific guitar leads and solos and some killer vocals courtesy of Mikael Stanne, delivered in his trademark higher-pitched rasp as opposed to a typical death metal growl. The lyrics are fantastic, with a very cold, futuristic vibe to them, and are one of mm favorite things about the album. The production is crystal clear and sharp and fits this album perfectly; kudos to the sound engineer who mixed this record.\n\nThe futuristic vibe of the lyrics is enhanced by occasional techno-ish keyboards and industrial-esque breakdowns, though both are used with such infrequency that impact rather than annoyance is what is felt. If there's one musical high point of the album though, it would be Icipher, which stands as one of the best metal songs I've ever heard. The breakdown that occurs mid-song is chilling and in my mind is not only a high point for this album but for the genre as a whole. Every song has its strengths though, from the pounding of Focus Shift to the dark noir-jazz feel of Into the Particle Storm to Blind at Heart with its hard industrial breakdowns. The songwriting here is absolutely top notch.\n\nFiction is, as I said above, one of my favorite metal albums. It's fast, heavy, well thought and and well written metal with a real forlorn feel to it, and I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes good heavy, aggressive but also laid back (if that makes any sense at all) Gothenburg Death Metal.\n",
        "\nAmong with In Flames and At the Gates, Dark Tranquillity is one of the founders of the Gothenburg death metal scene. Their 9th album, \u201cWe Are the Void\u201d, got me excited for I feel this will sound as good as their last album three years ago, \u201cFiction\u201d, although a very melodic album, the band has managed to use the melodic elements for the better. Will this album live up to its expectations?\n\nThe musicianship, first of all, is what you\u2019ve expected: very professional. It\u2019s no surprise for these guys have already made 8 full-length albums prior to this one and because of their fame nowadays it\u2019s not a surprise that the production is polished, making the bass silent. The music has a dark and a very melancholic atmosphere, although this album is what you will call a \u201cFiction Pt. II\u201d. The vocals, which are raspier than the average melodic death vocals, sound very graceful indeed. The guitars and the keyboards sound like the ones on \u201cFiction\u201d, but more melodic. \n\n\u201cFatalist\u201d is the first good song here in the vein of \u201cFiction\u201d. Although the chorus is somewhat annoying, it makes it up for the atmosphere. \u201cAt the Point of Ignition\u201d is one melancholic song with a very melancholic atmosphere that is bound to keep you from boredom. \u201cHer Silent Language\u201d is the album\u2019s ballad, again with clean vocals. The singing performance on this song adds more melancholy to the song. \u201cArkhangelsk\u201d has a good build-up of its very dark atmosphere, albeit the weird title. \u201cI Am the Void\u201d is the only aggressive song in the album that reminds me of \u201cThe Gallery\u201d, but still manages to keep the album\u2019s melancholy by slowing down during the chorus. \u201cIridium\u201d being the last song, suits to end the album for being more melancholic than the rest of the songs.\n\nThe album\u2019s problem lies on two things alone: first, as I\u2019ve told you earlier, being \u201cFiction Pt. II\u201d. Even from the very first time you hear this album, you\u2019ll notice that this album has little, if not none, difference compared to \u201cFiction\u201d. And second, this album is too radio-friendly. All the songs here have the keyboards as the main instrument. Well, this is death metal, only melodic, so basically you\u2019ll need the force and the power that the guitar gives. Although it\u2019s not bad to let the keyboards be the main instrument on the chorus or some other part, the band should know that too much keyboards is bad, especially on a death metal record.\n\nDespite the negatives, this is still a very solid release nonetheless. Dark Tranquillity is indeed a band excellent at delivering you melancholic songs to your mind, ever. Just get this one if you like \u201cFiction\u201d.\n\nOriginally made for http://mystifymyserie.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nPerplexion. Total perplexion.\n\nMy first exposure to Dark Tranquility was way back in 1996 with the Enter Suicidal Angels EP and I thought it was brilliant, thereby leading me to The Gallery, The Mind\u2019s I, and Skydancer, all of which I found equally good. When I hear the term \u201cmelodic death metal\u201d I think of some emo kids in the mall playing two chords and screeching into microphones at ear-splitting volume. It\u2019s sad but true. DT had once owned that particular subgenre and kept it somewhat pure and unsullied, but I\u2019m still not sure what to make of We Are the Void to be perfectly honest. It\u2019s a good album to listen to, but I would think that aside from the vocal delivery the \u201cmelodic death\u201d tag no longer applies here. My only fair comparison is Metallica\u2019s Load: it\u2019s a fine album in and of itself, but not a Metallica record, plain and simple. I think the same goes for We Are the Void. I\u2019m sorry to say this is as close to mallcore music as one can get without flopping one\u2019s hair into only one eye.\n\nOn the surface it appears that DT has progressed, yes, but there\u2019s progression and then there\u2019s the foregoing of your own self, which has happened here. As I say, the album sounds pretty good for some \u201cgroove metal\u201d that is somewhat enjoyable and well-crafted within its parameters, but as far as a Dark Tranquility CD it\u2019s short of that former acceleration and flexibility that made them so good once upon a time. \n\nThe songs are well-structured, nicely played, and abound with somewhat memorable, albeit transparent melodies. Still, it\u2019s very difficult to render this album high praise simply because the transition from one sound to another is almost too drastic. If not for the vocals a couple of the tracks actually sound radio-friendly, even power metal with heavy keyboards and melodies more akin to Nightwish or Rhapsody than the band that once issued \u201cZodijackyl Light.\u201d I must admit the keys on this album utterly killed me! They are far too prevalent and I keep imagining power metal bands all over the place, a very unpleasant occurrence for me. \n\nI hasten to use the term pedestrian as I seem to use the word a bit when describing something not up to par with a band\u2019s ability or past achievements, but this release is so commercially-geared it\u2019s almost saddening. The track \u201cHer Silent Language\u201d sounds like a bad Bauhaus-meets-extreme-vocals hybrid to be taken seriously. In my opinion it reeks of a go-with-the-flow mentality, one that should never have been realized considering the band\u2019s past successes. The closest track to the old feel is \u201cI Am the Void,\u201d which manages to blast the ears like a sledgehammer, but right as you\u2019re getting into the feel of Dark Tranquility the way they deserve to be heralded the keyboards come in and dismantle the aggressive emotional knot just as quickly. \n\nWhile musically brilliant in its own way, We Are the Void spans too far an emptiness to be called a simple void. The leap here is more like an infinity journey that doesn\u2019t fare well for the long haul. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalpsalter.com)\n",
        "\nI really feel that Dark Tranquillity peaked with their 2002 album Damage Done, which was basically flawless, each track loaded with good hooks, and an excellent fusion of the bands keyboard-heavy atmosphere, driving inspirational guitar lines and Stanne's heavy (if not brutal) delivery. It more than compensated for the half-mediocre albums the band had been releasing like Projector or Haven. Since that time, Dark Tranquillity have remade Damage Done in 2005 and 2007, calling it Character and then Fiction. Granted, the riffs were not always exactly the same, and the production was arguably superior, but just listen through the chugging and the tempos of the tracks in general and it becomes clear that the magic of Damage Done was the formula that the band wanted to relive.\n\nHere, eight years after the fact, we have the bands 9th album, We Are the Void, and once again, I am reminded very closely of Damage Done. Stanne's vocals seem to have a blacker edge to them, more of a vicious rasp which I actually don't think even borders on improvement. The band still experiments a little with the writing, but most of the album does feel as if you've already heard it. That being said, there are about 3-4 tracks on this which do stand out pretty far, amidst a crowd of filler that feels like it was already perfected earlier in the previous decade.\n\nWe Are the Void feels as much modern as the past few releases, opening with the booming bass and synth-driven mystique of \"Shadows in Our Blood\", which has a few decent thrashing melodic death rhythms and acceptable lead work, but doesn't feel all that remarkable. \"Dream Oblivion\" has a huge groove hook not unlike something Soilwork would have written during their 2000-2003 period, with a bouncy bridge over which the proggy electro keys strafe. \"The Fatalist\" has some resonant electric piano strikes over a generic chug, and then a melodic pick me up riff which isn't far from Damage Done, though the synth line there gives it an enhanced atmosphere. \"In My Absence\" is the first track on the album which I felt compelled to listen more than once, with a great chorus and some nice charging segments that shift into breakdowns.\n\nAnd that's the story here: you go through a couple of filler-feeling tracks to get at the meat of the album. \"The Grandest Accusation\" and \"At the Point of Ignition\" went straight in one ear, and out the other, but \"Her Silent Language\" is fairly poignant and memorable through its goth vocals and gorgeous melodic mute pickings. Of course, if you don't like a mix of clean and melodeath vocals, stay clear. \"Arkhangelsk\" borders on symphonic black metal, not unlike Dimmu Borgir or Moonspell, but it's not all that great. \"I Am the Void\" is another of the album's strongest tracks, with a rousing rhythmic pulse that veers between dense thrash and layered synthesizer atmosphere. \"Surface the Infinite\" is similar if less interesting, but the closing track \"Iridium\" is possibly the best on the entire record, with a massive wall of ringing pianos and a highly melancholic riff sequence.\n\nIt's a fairly good album, and I'd expect no less from a veteran band such as this, but it just doesn't have that level of songwriting which evokes any desire to play it through in its entirety. If you think Character and Fiction are the be all end all of this band's catalog, then I can't imagine you'd find this disappointing. Nor did I, since I haven't exactly built any expectations around the band in years. There are a few songs here I'd certainly incorporate into an iPod playlist of the band's material, but the rest simply feel too average to revisit.\n\nHighlights: In My Absence, Her Silent Language, I Am the Void, Iridium\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBetween the extravagant The Gallery and Projector pushing melodic death\u2019s boundaries, you have this unmemorable (but not unavoidable) hunk of ritual waste. Production beefed up all the instruments, Stanne honed his vocals, and the band\u2019s tone grew even darker than before (probably the darkest it ever got). Two music videos were spawned and the band\u2019s mother, Mrs. Century Media, pressed reissues - but who really gave two shits about this album? Twelve songs really pushed the time limit and there wasn\u2019t a whole lot you could do with the formula to keep people in their seats before turning this off.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, Stanne really nailed his vocals down for the first time in his singing career. His growls here are wretched like a lion\u2019s ferocious roar, and the lasting power of them reigns over the riffs and their tonality boost, as well. Between them, the album\u2019s authority beats out everything else the band had released at the time \u2013 nothing they recorded up to this point could compete in terms of aggression and intensity, but the band did themselves in by killing off their harmonies. On previous albums you could always look forward to leads throwing you into the furnace of classical bliss, but this one shows very little of those and instead goes straight for melodic riffs and breaks instead. In some respect this works for songs individually, but as a whole it makes for an incredibly redundant and one-dimensional album with very little lasting value.\n\nTheir style here would follow them onto Projector, which further perfected their sound that continues to this very day. However, that album lacks the cryptic, hedonistic darkness that clouds over this one like Morgoth\u2019s (Tolkien reference) fart clouds. The passages accompanying this one are beautiful in a reflective, somber way as opposed to the classical, descriptive flare that engulf The Gallery. That album doesn\u2019t touch this one in terms of boiled anger, but then again that one doesn\u2019t contain constant blasting and dull personality. Not even the bass, with its droopy booms and cranky grumbles, has the decency to rescue this album (save for a couple tracks).\n\nThe tempo remains mid-paced throughout, with songs like \u201cZodijackyl Light,\u201d \u201cAtom Heart 243.5,\u201d and \u201cDissolution Factor Red\u201d racing a little faster. The more enigmatic tracks like \u201cHedon,\u201d \u201cConstant,\u201d \u201cStill Moving Sinews,\u201d and \u201cTidal Tantrum\u201d hold the best riffs and passages that\u2019ll tingle your spine, which was supposed to be the point of the album. The whole thing intended to be gloomy and penchant, but it only gets the second half down correctly. The gloominess comes when you find yourself sitting in an awkward position just to level out the boredom you\u2019ll be feeling when listening to this. Drumming is fluent in consistency, never letting up one moment of lazy relapse like many death metal drummers think they can get away with. Jivarp\u2019s kit sounds so beefy and strong that it\u2019ll be the bane of your eardrums (in a good way). \n\nIn terms of composition, this may be Dark Tranquillity\u2019s most progressive / experimental / intellectual release, especially considering how simplistic their music has been for the last ten years. That doesn\u2019t make this one the best since it bores me to death, but there\u2019s tough love to be found here that truly fits the gap between the early releases and the later ones. The foundations cemented by The Mind\u2019s I would act as the same foundation for later albums, as the style hasn\u2019t necessarily been altered too much (they just focused on the riffs and threw keys in). It\u2019s a mixed bag for me, but it might be Santa\u2019s bag or a garbage bag for you.\n",
        "\nI prefer Stanne\u2019s later growls; these mutilated growls are weak and reek of Mountain Dew. Not only that, but there\u2019s hardly any power behind them at all. Even by The Gallery he\u2019d get the scream / growl right, but here the production and his lack of power kill the vocals. The baroque style of melodic death adapts well with them, as it could if the vocals were deeper grunts and bellows. Regardless of how weak Stanne sounds, you can\u2019t help but hear a sense of torment and anguish with each shrill of words. The best combination erupts on \u201cAway, Delight, Away\u201d where drums gallop and the lead slices harmoniously like a sword to a vine. Stanne lets loose everything his throat can muster between the delicate melodies intertwining with corrupted riffs \u2013 a proud representation of this exaggerated Gothenburg style.\n\nFor a release under twenty minutes, it\u2019s a great teaser featuring the band in a transitioning period between the debut and sophomore albums. Production steps the game up, lending greater authority to the guitar tone to hammer away and claw at nature. The melodies do well treading lightly with classical music, but the riffs dispel all stoic emotions \u2013 \u201cWith Flaming Shades Of Fall\u201d is indeed the heaviest this EP has to offer and can back that statement up. I\u2019m not too surprised though at how little the bass contributes to the music; you get that low-end grumble most of the time, but the only track I recognize where its creativity converges is with the new rendition of \u201cAlone.\u201d It competes with the guitars and holds the weight of all basses as it pounds the living daylights out of the relaxing tone. I hear yawning clean vocals from Stanne, too, but they\u2019re incredibly subdued and rare.\n\nJivarp has been behind the band\u2019s kit since the beginning, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him speak once; makes me assume (poorly) that the guy\u2019s a mute, but his drumming likely speaks louder than anything he\u2019d ever say. Blast beats are comforting and the snare is brutally clean while cymbals are extra weak (bumble bees). He\u2019ll go up and down tempos as if the guitars are trying to fuck with him, but he keeps up better than they can \u2013 he never talks, so he obviously doesn\u2019t have a problem with it.\n\nThis EP, although nothing essential, does pack a punch that at least knocks out the debut. The \u201cAlone\u201d on this one slays the original \u201cAlone\u201d and none of these songs would appear on any other album (not counting the debut reissue), so it\u2019s a sleeper you\u2019ll have to download if you want to hear it. Again, nothing spectacular that you\u2019ll take over any of the band\u2019s better albums, but a nice little duckling nonetheless.\n",
        "\nGothenburg. The name is like acid on my tongue. For so long I have named this genre as my enemy, and it is time now, in the equinox of 2009, to put the hatchets down, stop waging war and really get down to the meat of what I hate about this genre so much.\n\nDark Tranquillity is famous as one of the leading Gothenburg acts, and this is apparently their most popular album. I remember reviewing The Gallery at the beginning of this year and getting quite a lot of flak for it. I am not usually one to respond to such backlash, but looking back, the review was lousy, and I believe this band deserves a better written review, even if I still think they\u2019re lame as hell. So now I\u2019m going to review Character. Ready? I hope so, because I\u2019m not.\n\nThis is technically as sound as can be. There are no glaring inconsistencies or silly mistakes as on The Gallery - Character is polished to a neat, comfortable sheen. The playing is accomplished, and many a listener will be drawn in by the flashy guitar work and pragmatic heaviness, as the dedication to writing no-nonsense music will lead them to think that this has some kind of sophistication. There is a poppy sensibility about this, mostly in the keyboards, and it makes the whole thing sound just that much more accessible. That isn\u2019t bad; it certainly makes the package easy to digest and listen to. You will never be annoyed with this, but then, the band seems not to have enough talent to annoy you to begin with. The prevailing mood here is one of Apathy.\n\nHonestly, I just don\u2019t like this. This album ironically has a distinct lack of anything resembling character. It is metal music by the numbers. It is the kind of middle-of-the-road material that I have a great distaste for \u2013 the guitars meticulously churn out riffs for the sake of being technical, the bass clicks and wheezes along, the drums fill in everything in a most complicated manner and everything is tailored to be as modern as possible. All of these things appear to be happening for no other reason than because it is what metal bands do - there is no sense of real musical creativity on this album. The way this album sounds to me is like the band wrote this album because it was expected of them, as Dark Tranquillity, to write it. At least the old stuff was funny at times because of the glaringly weak songwriting \u2013 now that they have improved, I find them even less entertaining.\n\nPeople endlessly champion this band and others like it for reasons that are pretty hazy and vague \u2013 the riffs? Yes, there are certainly riffs here, but the quantity does not add up to anything stirring or memorable. Most of the time they\u2019re just ripping off Iron Maiden with a more modern sound and keys backing it. The heaviness\u2026well, sure, it\u2019s heavy, but it\u2019s also rather streamlined and easy to listen to if you\u2019ve listened to the metal genre as a whole for longer than a few months. There is nothing that challenging or exciting about this, no sense of rebellion or pride exuded from its pores. It is music from a production line, made in parts, without any real feeling to it. Play some calculated and boring riffs, make sure to keep a melody going from the keys and end the song after four and a half minutes. None of these songs is that different from that which comes before or after it. People seem to think that the fact that this band makes legitimate metal music is some reason to praise them, even though they are so thoroughly average - it is not. As if that is some kind of an achievement. Like making metal music is that much harder to do than not making metal music.\n\nIt\u2019s like, metal with RIFFS and KEYBOARDS at the same time? With GROWLING, too? Holy smokes, call the press! We have never seen THAT before!\n\nThere are a few moments here that are pleasant to listen to and that serve as some sort of candy to the ears. That is not really any testament to any perceived \u2018talent\u2019 of the band in question though, as it is just the process of elimination \u2013 write songs long enough and you inevitably come up with something that is pleasant. Such listenability does not even take that much talent in the first place, when so many better bands have done it with more finesse and greater character and style. Pleasant. In what twisted, parallel universe should that word be the prevalent descriptor of a Heavy Metal album? This is a sad state of affairs, people.\n\nSongs are titled asinine things like \u201cLost in Apathy,\u201d \u201cMy Negation\u201d and \u201cOut of Nothing\u201d \u2013 can they get any more generic? I mean, while you\u2019re at it, why don\u2019t you just make this album self titled and go full-stop clich\u00e9 modern metal? You\u2019re one step away from that, anyway. I don\u2019t know; I just really hate this whole modern \u201cpessimistic\u201d lyrical trend that pervades amongst these kinds of bands. I kind of doubt these songs are really about anything \u2013 such encompassing, sweeping generalizations of pessimism are meaningless and stupid, and I almost wish this band would just start writing emo lyrics about rebellion and lost love so at least I could have something to laugh at. At least then I could feel one way or the other about it.\n\nThis band is shallow and lifeless. This album is decently written for what it is, but I derive no enjoyment from it. Character is the kind of thing that makes me tired of listening to metal; it really is. This is music that does not go anywhere. This music is fuel to the fire for everyone who ever said metal sucked. It is frighteningly basic, having to feign even the most elementary kinds of emotion with its \u201catmospheric\u201d synthesizers and those butt-clenching lyrics, mistaking this terrible lack of personality and charisma for \u2018sobriety\u2019\u2026this becomes insufferable in its mediocrity. It is clever in the way that it will fool you into thinking it is excusable with a nice riff or a passable lead, but do not fall into that trap. Dark Tranquillity is all but completely worthless.\n",
        "\nProjector showed us the new direction Dark Tranquillity wanted to take, but who knew they\u2019d pretty much copy the same album over and over? Not a direct copy, but the same elements and style remains consistent since this album. Of all the albums, this is one of the ones that I hear talked about the least. For Dark Tranquillity fans, it\u2019s nothing special like Damage Done, but that\u2019s because they don\u2019t really push beyond their limit. Yeah, they did that with the last album, whereas here they just sound much more focused and comfortable in playing the basics.\n\nStanne doesn\u2019t perform any clean vocals except on \u201cEmptier Still,\u201d and they still remind me of Sean Bean for some reason. That Sheffield accent and all\u2026 anyway, the rest is marked with his signature grumpy growl. It\u2019s a tad raspy but more deep and you can feel it come straight from his throat. They add to the monotony of the album, since every song (despite different tempos, melodies, riffs, and such) sounds very alike. Production is the biggest offender, since everything sounds so crisp, heavy, and clear. Bass gets loads of help; it\u2019s grumbling can be heard unmistakably and contributes to making the album sound much heavier than it actually is. \n\nThe biggest swaying power comes from the keys, easily. Riffwise it\u2019s a mournfully dark album, but nothing beyond classically dark. The keys are much more gimmicky than before, and this is where we hit our real problem. Some songs they keys dip in some atmosphere, but other times I just want to break them. Yes, they\u2019re on every song, but their input depends on how much the main riffs slay. \u201cIndifferent Suns,\u201d \u201cHaven,\u201d and \u201cThe Same\u201d all perform well with little / insignificant keyboard help because they don\u2019t need the support. However, take some weaker / more mundane riffs like those in \u201cThe Wonders At Your Feet,\u201d \u201cRundown,\u201d and \u201cAt Loss For Words,\u201d and now you\u2019ve got the band trying to cover their tracks.\n\nIt\u2019s with this whole fashion that you begin to think just how processed everything starts to sound. It\u2019s not as processed as In Flames\u2019 albums at the time, but damn it it\u2019s still Gothenburg: shallow and catchy. I\u2019m asking myself at this very moment why this is still in my library? What, because I think it\u2019s good? What draws the line between good and bad? This? That can\u2019t be, because the standard is so low compared. So fuck it, the guitars aren\u2019t what I\u2019d consider fantastic at all. They don\u2019t follow the baroque kind of Gothenburg that the band was known for on The Gallery and The Mind\u2019s I. It\u2019s just been modernized; riffs with a lot of bark but no real bite. \u201cIndifferent Suns\u201d and its kind still kill because you can actually get into the song with its hefty lead and double bass gallop, but otherwise I can\u2019t really hold on to this album any longer. Yeah by the way the drums really get the dishwashing job on this album, like most. Jivarp is a beast with tons of skill, and the sound of the drums is great without any hollow snares, toms, or padded double bass. I just can\u2019t help but feel how unnoticed it goes, and the music lumps the entire thing together into one artificial collage.\n\nWell, without a doubt this album and band still mutilate In Flames and At The Gates. It\u2019s not even a joke, Dark Tranquillity is still one of the only central Gothenburg bands I listen to, but I\u2019ll have to part with this album specifically. It\u2019s a shame, but everything\u2019s got to die sometime.\n",
        "\nI am quite fond of Dark Tranquillity mainly because of the eerie atmospheres this band has a knack for conveying in every album they wrote. \"The Gallery\", for an example, was kind of a fuck up in the \u2018heavy riffing\u2019 department due to its way too constant lead guitar, but it sure had some interesting melodies to make up for it and the whole thing sounded beautifully barroque. Like a mad bard playing frantically while singing about his innermost woes. Ah, the good old crazy shit.\n\n\"Fiction\" is, as many have pointed before, a keyboard-centered album. Here, Brandstrom's keys are loud and simplistic, but the atmosphere they create is probably the best in this band's career. It's introspective, sorrowful and melancholic without the sugary aspect this genre is known for when employing keyboards, but it was the guitars that had me divided the last time I reviewed this. Here's some considerations about it:\n\nPreviously, I used to chastise this album for what I perceived to be underwhelming guitar work. Well, after listening to many other melodeath albums and becoming even more accustomed to the fine tunings of DT\u2019s craft, I had a change of heart. See, reviewing is a subjective, weird little thing. From my point of view, an album should be analysed and criticised by what it is within the context it was created, not by what the reviewer thinks it should be.\n\nThe thing is, even if bands like Kalmah and Garden of Shadows exist to prove the contrary, melodic death metal is not a subgenre that exists almost solely on the strength of sheer riffwork, like thrash does. It is a nuanced beast with many ramifications that differ from band to band, even if the core staples (Higher pitched death growls + thrashdeath drumwork + guitar harmonies inspired by Iron Maiden, etc) are almost always present.\n\nFor an example, it\u2019s safe to assume that \"Jester Race\", \"The Mind\u2019s I\" and \"Oracle Moon\" are all melodic death metal albums, even if the first one is a blueprint for gothenburg \u2013melodeath\u2019s more accessible brother- , rocket science won\u2019t be needed for the listener to understand the vast differences in songwriting and atmosphere of these three excellent releases. \n\nMy point being, reviewing Stratovarius while having your mind set on Wormphlegm will get you nowhere. \u201cFiction\u201d finds Henriksson and Sundin going for just the right amount of guitar shenanigans for it to be called a decent post \u201cDamage Done\u201d Dark Tranquillity album, just as the more aggressive \u201cCharacter\u201d did. Sure, some groove hooks could be better implemented like the one on \u201cTerminus\u201d and solos could be longer, but those guys were never big on the whole Tipton & Downing vibe, so their stuff is a tad different and very competent here, like the intro riff to \u201cIcipher\u201d, that works really well with the keys and tracks like \u201cThe Lesser Faith\u201d, \u201cNothing to no One\u201d and especially \"Blind at Heart\" strike me as particularly riff-heavy, even when employing the aforementioned grating one note grooves. \n\nVocally, this album is also not bad. I do enjoy Stanne\u2019s vocals because the man just never failed me. I mean, his voice was always good, it didn\u2019t go from tolerable to shit like Angela Gossow\u2019s or from shit to a complete goddamn disaster like Anders Friden\u2019s. This man is probably one of the most focused and enjoyable Gothenburg vocalists and is also a damn fine lyricist too. Also, his clean baritone vocals are back and they don\u2019t sound bad, fortunately. Nell Sigland (of Theatre of Tragedy fame) also makes a cameo in the last track trading some vocals with him, and the result is also quite fun.\n\nThe lyrics are the good ol\u2019 Dark Tranquillity fare, featuring obscure metaphors and abstract themes, but this time they apparently chose a slightly more direct way of writing, as evidenced in \u2018Misery\u2019s Crown\u2019 and \u2018Icipher\u2019. And as far as drumming goes, Anders Jivarp delivers a sharp performance, as always. As for the production, it is slightly thin but not raw black metal-like thin. I found it very sterile and cold, more than fitting to the kind of sensations they were trying to convey here, specially on Brandstrom's end. \n\nThere are some highlights, such as this album\u2019s best track, the great \u201cThe Lesser Faith\u201d, which blends the keyboards seamlessly with the guitar tracks and is an absolute winner in terms of atmosphere. Other good tracks include \u201cEmpty Me\u201d with its beautiful chorus and ending, and the aforementioned \u201cIcipher\u201d for its somewhat cold and introspective feeling.\n\nThis is a powerful grouping of songs that keep, in each and every one of them, a feeling of intangible coldness that spreads to every other instrument like a virus, morphing the individual parts into something else, something stranger but still pleasant to listen. \"Fiction\" is Dark Tranquillity absorbing the coldness of their own atmosphere and using it as a cloak. Perhaps stunted here or there, but still capable of delivering the goods and an amazing sonicscapes when the time is right.\n\n\n(Oh, and the album also features some good bonus tracks)\n",
        "\nSometimes it\u2019s funny to listen to an old debut album. Nowadays, a band that\u2019s clearly still developing doesn\u2019t often get a chance to put out a full-length album, but things were very different in the early nineties. What makes Dark Tranquillity a special case among all the bands that started out back then, is the fact that they managed to start on a high note. \u2018Skydancer\u2019 is their best album to date, and not only that; it\u2019s also one of the best melodic death metal albums ever.\n\nHowever, this does by no means imply that the album is flawless. There is a certain awkwardness in the music that could perhaps be explained away \u2013 on grounds of early stages and all that \u2013 had it not grown worse on some of their later releases. For one thing, the songwriting is most of the time patchy and illogical (as opposed to unique or innovative), and not fluent in any conventional way. The songs feel like rambling \u2013 there are often simply too many different things in one song. If you can\u2019t take my word for it, listen to \u2018Shadow Duet\u2019 which, incidentally, is probably the best track this album has to offer. When the structures are more straightforward and a song sticks to one distinguishable mood, a different type of awkwardness appears \u2013 namely, that the melodies don\u2019t seem to \u201cgo\u201d anywhere. It still seems patchy, in the sense that the parts don\u2019t work together very well, even if they are good individually (see: \u2018In Tears Bereaved\u2019). There\u2019s also often a hasty feel in the music, like the band can\u2019t leave well enough alone but keep on cramming notes into melodies, beats into drum patterns and words into vocal lines just for the sake of having more of them there (see: \u2018Nightfall by the Shore of Time\u2019).\n\nAs many probably know, the music mainly consists of tremolo-picked two-guitar melodies that clearly have their foundation in Iron Maiden et al., but there is also a technical quality to this that makes me think a band like Atheist could count as an influence too. The palm-muted riffage typical for most death metal is very seldom heard and the compositions are anything but \"brutal\"; I would rather say that there is a sophisticated and thought-out feel to this, focusing more on musicianship than heaviness per se. What is also notable is that some of the tracks seem like \"theme and variations\" instead of following any common structures. For example, 'A Bolt of Blazing Gold', shifting from clean plucking to distorted riffage and back again, has essentially the same melodic form throughout the song. When executed well, the guitar parts are phenomenal in their melodic interplay, but only very rarely does this last for an entire song. 'My Faeryland Forgotten' (which even features some conventional riffs) and 'Alone' (a slower, almost peaceful track) are the most consistent ones. Sometimes the twin guitars can sound a bit thin, as both occasionally venture to higher tones, but these parts are salvaged by the bass. I'm not a huge fan of the bassist's style - he often plays much like a third guitarist - but at least the instrument takes up a lot of (otherwise empty) space where appropriate, leaving the guitars free to explore their harmony lines.\n\nWhat I don't like at all on this album are the drums and vocals. The drumming sounds stiff, in a word. The beats are unimaginative and don't often fit the music too well, making the rhythm feel forced and unnatural.\nThere are times when I wish the drums would keep quiet altogether, in particular some of the clean parts suffer from the rigid beating; 'Through Ebony Archways' is a perfect example of this. As for the singing, there's simply too much of it. Or, better said, too much lyrics - they have their role in making the music feel hasty. Some great instrumental work is buried under a mass of growls (and those are not really spectacular, either). What's more, I honestly don't see a point in having two vocalists, as Frid\u00e9n and Stanne sound just about exactly the same. The clean male voice that appears on two tracks is dreadful and should have been left out completely. The voice is weak and barely in tune, the kind that makes you wonder if the band knew what they were doing. And then there are the lyrics that seriously make me shudder; way too many fancy words and totally obscure metaphors that seem pretentious and make you think they were written with the help of a dictionary.\n\nBut, even with all its flaws, I have to say I like \u2018Skydancer\u2019. It\u2019s personal, really, since this was one of the albums that introduced me to death metal. (Not that I ever thought of it as death metal; to me this was always more like \u201cmelodic metal with harsh vocals\u201d, but the difference is rather slight.) There are parts on the album that still give me the chills. I\u2019ve only started criticizing some sides of the music after becoming a somewhat analytical musician myself, so my complaints are not to be given too much weight \u2013 I don\u2019t even do so myself. \n\nFor a concluding historical note, it is astonishing to notice how remarkably few obvious similarities this album has with the established styles of the death metal scene of its time, be it Florida, Stockholm or NYC \u2013 as we all now know, 'Skydancer' is for its part responsible for creating the \"Gothenburg sound\". I don't care much for what melodic death metal, the Gothenburg scene, or Dark Tranquillity themselves have later become, but this is an album of undeniable historical significance. It has its flaws, yes, but as a document of early melodeath, it also has its place in the collection of any DM enthusiast.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Dark Tranquillity hasn\u2019t changed their sound a whole lot for the past ten years or so. They\u2019ve been playing generally same type of melodic death ever since they picked up Martin Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m and started adding keyboard parts to their albums. They tweak each album a little, but not much. \n\nThe focus point in Dark Tranquillity\u2019s music clearly isn\u2019t the guitar work. If you exclude the bass part (when audible sounds creative) the lead guitar work is kind of weak. The songs consist of simple and repetitive riffs consisting of around one to three notes. Where as the melodies (taken from Iron Maiden? You decide) are generally simple also. To put it they\u2019re just in the background. Some songs have some catchy ones, \u201cAm I 1?\u201d and \u201cOut of Nothing\u201d I guess would be the strongest songs on the album. \n\nThe main focus in DT\u2019s music I have found would be the vocal performance by Mikael Stanne. Mikael is basically the key item of this band from sticking out. His vocals are different compared to other vocalist in melodic death work. This mainly has to do with his higher pitch growl he does where compared to the lower and monotonous growls much like the vocalist in this subgenre much like the ones Anders Frid\u00e9n gave on DT\u2019s early work. \n\nKeyboards, they use a lot of them. And they are also the other main feature to this band nowadays. Let\u2019s face it, if you hate these guys the main reason is probably the keyboard use they use. I can see why also, it\u2019s overused, and if they\u2019re going for an atmosphere approach they failed miserably. But Martin does pull off some cool parts in some songs like \u201cOne Thought\u201d, and the ending to \u201cMy Negation\u201d is cool. \n\nIs this their best album? No not at all. Is it their worst album? I wouldn\u2019t say that either. Its kind of just borderline same-old-same-old Dark Tranquillity doing what they normally do. Dark Tranquillity fans who haven\u2019t heard it will most likely enjoy it, and so will people who like a lot of keyboard in their metal.\n\nEdit: fixed mistake.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity is one of those bands that are different in every album. There is a lot of variation between their different albums, while the core always remains the same. Some people may find this negative, since it would seem to them that they are still looking for a sound. I however find this positive. In this way it never gets boring, but still always recognizable.\n\nKicking off heavily with \"The New Build\", a strong, fast, technical and heavy song and finalizing with the slower and passionate \"My Negation\", this album is full of variation. Every song is heavy and strong, but in different ways. While the first two tracks are fast, other tracks such as \"The Endless Feed\" and \"Dry Run\" get their heaviness from a slow but pounding rythm. \n\nThe vocals are possibly the best about this album. From beginning to end Mikael Stanne screams and grunts his lyrics into the microphone with incredible emotion, power and passion. The lyrics are - but how could we expect different from DT - great and you really need a spade to dig in your brain to find the meaning behind. So they may be difficult to understand, but nonetheless they really do have meaning. A funny note is that for me, those ideas of what a certain song may mean come at the most weird, or perhaps normal, moments. Not when I'm sitting in my room and intensely listening to the music, but just when I am cycling home from school on an ordinary day. For example, in my interpretation the song \"Am I One?\" discusses the fact that some people keep denying the fact that people have different characters, and keep trying to frame them into their own visions. I really don't know if this is what Mikael Stanne meant by this song and these lyrics, but this is my interpretation.\n\nNow for something else: the instruments. The keyboards have always played a significant role in Dark Tranquillity's music(Well, Since 1999's Projecter, that is). They never dominate the music there, but they are always prominent. The same is the case on \"Character\". They either play a more Piano-ish role, such as on \"My Negation\" or \"Lost To Apathy\" or a more electric role, such as on \"The Endless Feed\". \n\nOne thing that I usually dislike, so to speak, about Dark Tranquillity is their lack of solos. But on the other hand it would be difficult to fit a good solo into an average DT song, if there even is an \"average\" DT song. Guitars may get quite technical as is the case on songs such as \"The New Build\" and \"Mind Matters\". With rasping riffs of incredible rawness and awesomeness Martin Henriksson and Niklas Sundin rage through each song, leaving few space for the bass on some occasions. \"Out Of Nothing\" is an exception here, as the bass is prominent a lot more often here. \n\nThe drums are pushed somewhat more to the foreground, and usually exactly as one could expect: fast and technical on the faster songs, and less forthcoming but still essential on the slower songs. My favourite \"drum moment\" is without any doubt the very beginning of the first song, \"The New Build\", which is like a very short drumsolo.\n\nWhat remains a bit obscure to me, is the production. I do not know how they managed to do it, but in some way they managed the best production I have ever heard so far. Raw at every moment, which makes all the emotion and passion that these six Swedes have poured into it. Never before have I heard a production that fitted the music so good as this one. There's many albums with a good or even great production, but there are always some small things that could have been done better, although they may not even be very significant. On \"Character\" this is not the case, everything has been taken good care of.\n\nAll in all, this is a masterpiece that probably couldn't have been forged anywhere else than in Sweden, and is possibly the best album the Gothenburg scene has ever seen for now. You may ask \"Then why 99% and not 100%?\" Well, this is simply because nothing is perfect, nor is this album. Therefore, rating it 100% wouldn't be possible in my eyes, although this album gets dangerously close. If Dark Tranquillity continues to improve their sound like this, I may be forced to alter my opinion in the future, but for now it remains a 99%.\n\nListening tips: \"The New Build\", \"My Negation\", \"Am I One?\"\n",
        "\nAll right, I\u2019d like to add that both songs kick major ass. The videos are basically the music dubbed over the video (which are how most music videos are like), and it shows the earliest form of Dark Tranquillity in a music video. \u201cZodijackyl Light\u201d is much more aggressive, fast-paced, energetic, and pompous when it came to the solo. \u201cHedon\u201d is the longer of the two songs, but its slower, packs more emotion, melody, lyrical intricacy (if any), and a less pretentious bid at what I\u2019d call a solo.\n\nThe first video is shot in color and is really just the band playing in a monochrome of orange (yeah I know it\u2019s just shot with orange light in the back). Somehow it fits well with the band dressed in black and playing in sync with the music (and having fun at doing it). It\u2019s pretty much like a cornier live performance with lots of sheets blowing in the back, water effects, and fast editing. I can\u2019t tell if they\u2019re playing is rattling the earth or if they\u2019re overjoyed on a camping trip.\n\nThe second video is shot in black and white, with tons of fading in and out of the lyrics on sheets of paper like news articles and shit. Definitely fits with the more depressing vibe, but then we have the band members dressed up in leather jackets, boots, and looking fadtastic. Stanne is even sporting some shades, but there is a continuity error between edits because one second its off while the next its on and so forth. It also occasionally cuts to this scene of this overly queer guy attempting to perform a ritual by the book (literally). It doesn\u2019t really give me any deeper insight into the song, which makes it kind of pointless and a side deal. While this is all going on, it seems like the only light in the room are candles, thus making everything go darker and lighter at a rate of seconds \u2013 it gets annoying towards the end of it.\n\nIf you know Dark Tranquillity, then the songs generally sound how you\u2019d expect from them (their sound really hasn\u2019t changed dramatically since The Mind\u2019s I, or Projector if you want to be super accurate. Anyway, get the CD, ditch this VHS \u2013 who even owns a VHS player, let alone a VHS? Well, I do, kind of. This is solely collector material, but who\u2019d go out of their way to get this when both videos are up online?\n",
        "\nI know that if this was the only release I heard from this band, I would have been skeptical about them myself. The first track goes nowhere at all, and it stays that way for nearly eight minutes. However, \u201cYesterworld\u201d can count as the earliest hit by the band, so it saves us from complete misery. Both songs clock in at just less than eight minutes each, but I\u2019d call that stretching them way past their lifelines.\n\n\u201cUnfurled By Dawn\u201d starts off promising in a sort of classical melodic death fashion \u2013 truly an early sign of the genre. However, the next few minutes can be characterized as dull, redundant, and ruined by vague vocals. They\u2019re the same forced gasps that Frid\u00e9n is used to and I get really tired of them. The song attempts to hit melodic death metal throughout, but it barely scathes anything decent sans the drumming which is pretty packed and clear.\n\nThe intro to \u201cYesterworld\u201d sounds like the keyboard tune from Pan.Thy.Monium\u2019s second track off of Dawn of Dreams. It isn\u2019t exact note-for-note, but it\u2019s similar as hell and I immediately made the comparison upon hearing this for the first time. Regardless, this song is much better than the first track, with classical influences, a gloomier tone, a more menacing bass, and a grave acoustic outro.\n\nSlightly better production and one pretty good track are the only things gained from this release, but with better recordings of the track on later releases, I\u2019d hardly recommend hearing this release. It isn\u2019t passable as it is, and only die-hard fans or collectors would even think to hear this. In my opinion they should have scrapped the first track and released \u201cYesterworld\u201d on another EP or demo release. Could have saved it the burden of carry the torch all by itself.\n",
        "\nBehold, the earliest manifestation of Dark Tranquillity under the band name\u2026 Dark Tranquillity. This demo is an ode to the thrash and death metal juggernauts at the time, which bands like this and In Flames were mere mice against. There worship comes in the form of unpolished, menacingly evil sacrifices in four tracks.\n\n\u201cMidwinter\u201d is just a keyboard intro with atmosphere up the ass. Make me think of medieval kingdoms, fantasylands, maidens in distress, and early Candlemass album covers. This whoever is rudely awakened by the shift into \u201cBeyond Enlightenment,\u201d which shows no mercy as it tramples the weak in an Atrocity-like fashion. The vocals by Frid\u00e9n are dull and forced, which is a bad thing. They\u2019re harsh exhales of breath from what I hear, and he\u2019s pretty much rapping, considering he has a hard time keeping up with the fast rhythm. The riffs are also tiring and bland, but the energy is awesome and dark intentions are spot on.\n\n\u201cVernal Awakening\u201d I find to sound a lot like Sodom, and I swear I\u2019ve heard that riff halfway in the song from somewhere. What I find to stand out the most are the solos here, since Sundin and Stanne never show this sort of liveliness on later albums \u2013 those ones have quality, but never spirit like these early ones. The seven-minute monolith \u201cVoid Of Tranquillity\u201d carries on Entombed style, with drumming particular brisk and thumping, but the snares sound annoying and sharp.\n\nThe really class comes from the leadwork during interludes and solo bridges: adoring classical influences, melodic channels, medieval synths, all coarsely produced to give off that distinct retro sound. If I were to hear this demo back in 1991, I\u2019d give these guys kudos for a pretty enjoyable demo. It isn\u2019t essential to have, but if you are a fan of the band then it\u2019s kind of a treat to check it out and see how they played before they got big.\n",
        "\nAh, Gothenburg Melodeath. Never before has such a terrible waste of talent and time gotten such a strangely unanimous wall of praise. I'm one of those weirdos who thinks this shit is pretty lame, and as a result, I don't find much enjoyment in Dark Tranquillity's (notice how they spelled \"tranquility\" wrong? Was that intentional, or what?) supposed masterpiece of the genre, either. I can kind of see why people are attracted to this Gallery of bloated masturbation, but on my scale? This just barely keeps itself from not totally sucking. \n\nLet me start off with a typical analogy: The Gallery is sort of like a Thanksgiving dinner. You sit there and you stare at all of the delicious harmonies and the melodic Iron Maiden riffs and the double bass drum kicks and the screeching harsh vocals and the clicky bass sounds, and you're not very hungry, because you just ate a platter of DragonForce two hours ago, but you want to eat anyway, because it looks so good. But then you're served another plate of rip-roaring solemn/emotional clean male vocals on top of all of that, and you just can't bear it anymore. You wave your hands in front of you in protest as you fall backwards and your head hits the sewing machine behind you. And then you find out that it was only the first song, an appetizer of what's to come. Yeah, that's about what this album is like. The songwriting here isn't technically that bad, and the band is unquestionably talented, it's just that they're trying to do too much at once, cramming too many unnecessary elements into each song and making them kind of unmemorable, despite sounding cool sometimes. It's like if The Chasm's Deathcult got hooked on crack, for fuck's sake. God, even In Flames could construct a more memorable song than most of the shit on here, and that isn't exactly a high compliment!\n\nOkay, I was a bit harsh there. Dark Tranquillity at times conjure up some decent songs, like opener \"Punish My Heaven,\" which is alright despite my earlier diatribe about it, and serves as a good introduction to the band, and...and...alright, I just have to face reality here: It is not a good sign when the only memorable part of the album is the ridiculous clean bit in the title track where this female singer comes in and the song turns into a sort of Sarah McLachlan-esque ballad with a load of cheese that is fast growing stale around the edges. \"Lethe\" is also memorable for the wrong reasons, as it starts with a lame bit of guitar strumming that reminds me almost uncomfortably of Iron Maiden's infamous \"Children of the Damned,\" except unlike that classic intro, this one outstays its welcome by about ten seconds before the Metal kicks in, and only really serves to break up the flow of the album and bore the listener.\n\nYeah, the only reason this is getting any points at all is because most of it is listenable enough, and the cluttered songwriting at least shows a little bit of creativity, which is more than you could have said for many bands that were putting out albums at the time this was released in 1995. As deplorable as the genre is, in all its raging monotony and obnoxious trend-riding, it was actually pretty original and fresh once, and while I think The Gallery is a tepid, self indulgent Gallery of bullshit, I can't deny that it's really not as bad as it could have been. However, for my money, this won't be taking any trips to the cash register any time soon, and I think I'll be smart this time and not try to check out anything else from Dark Tranquillity.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nI originally listened to this album with low expectations. It\u2019s not that I had ever been disappointed with a Dark Tranquility release, but 1997\u2019s \u201cThe Mind\u2019s I\u201d was going to be a tough act to follow. Further fuelling my anticipation of mediocrity were the vast number of rumors flying around that the band had changed for the worse. Having finally listened, re-listened, analyzed, and cherished this disc, I can say with certainty that \u201cProjector\u201d is one of Dark Tranquillity's finest.\n\nThe most basic description of Dark Tranquility\u2019s music would undoubtedly include the dreaded \u201cGothenburg-style melodic death metal\u201d tag, but only the most casual listener will walk away from \u201cProjector\u201d with the same impression. This album saw the band moving into new territory with cleaner vocal sections, stronger hooks, and overall, a more orchestrated sound. Opener \u201cFreecard\u201d is an excellent example of Dark Tranquillity\u2019s approach at this stage, and serves as one of the album's defining moments. The upbeat string intro is followed by a majestic guitar riff, after which vocalist Michael Stanne steps in with some powerful roaring to throw everything into high gear. Other highlights include \u201cAuctioned\u201d, \u201cThe Sun Fired Blanks\u201d, and the surprisingly melodic \u201cDobermann\u201d. While I would tend to direct new listeners toward 'The Gallery' or the aforementioned 'The Mind's I', 'Haven' would be a worthy follow-up.\n",
        "\nFor months after its release, I had a tough time spotting a negative review of this album. To this day, I honestly can\u2019t figure out why! I have listened and re-listened to 'Haven' in an effort to discover whatever elusive element might warrant all the hype. I am obviously missing something, because I still find it incredibly disappointing. There is no major stylistic departure here, but most of its tracks seem contrived and uninspired. \n\nThe trouble begins right away, with vocalist Michael Stanne shouting \u201cAll Right!\u201d to kick off the disc\u2019s first track (\u201cThe Wonders At Your Feet\u201d). Maybe he\u2019s been listening to Savatage\u2019s \u201cSirens\u201d a lot lately, because Jon Oliva is the only singer in recent memory to effectively employ such a goofy-sounding cliche. If that weren\u2019t enough, Dark Tranquillity subjects its audience to an incredibly monotonous keyboard riff, which can only be compared to the five-finger patterns that piano teachers have used to build finger agility in generations of unwilling children.\n\nI would normally be able to dismiss such transgressions and move on to the other tracks, but it doesn\u2019t get much better from here. Granted, flashes of brilliance are hinted at on such songs as \u201cIndifferent Suns\u201d and \u201cFabric\u201d. But after the sheer genius of 'The Mind\u2019s I' and its compelling follow-up ('Projector'), I\u2019m at a loss to explain what went wrong. With keyboards that serve more to annoy than to augment and guitars riffs that fail to set any fires, \u201cHaven\u201d comes pretty damn close to being a total loss.\n\nMost Dark Tranquillity fans seem inexplicably enamored by this album, hinting at some sort of \u201cprogression\u201d that totally eludes me. Furthermore, I seem to remember several mainstream metal publications raving about 'Haven' like it\u2019s the second coming of Christ, set to music. If this review doesn\u2019t give any indication of my response to such praise, allow me to put it in one word: Whatever.\n",
        "\nEveryone knows Dark Tranquillity, being one of the most famous Gothenburg melodeath bands out there, and after their debut album Skydancer came this little EP from Spinefarm. First time featuring the now long time veteran vocalist Mikael Stanne who is probably a much better vocalist than the equally famous Anders Friden. It\u2019s quite an argument who\u2019s the better melodeath vocalist in their prime, I\u2019ve always been a fan of Friden in early Whoracle-era In Flames but here, Stanne dominates with Dark Tranquillity\u2019s overall sound; which is slightly different than early In Flames, being more progressive almost and more overall melodic in terms of lead guitar work. \n\nThis early EP shows Stanne in his early days, where he had more of a death growl with a slight melodic rasp to it than nowadays where it\u2019s purely a raspy knockoff of what Tomas Lindberg made popular; either way it fits perfectly on Of Chaos and Eternal Night. Featuring only 4 songs, Stanne makes himself known right from the get go with the best song on the album, the title track. It starts ominous and slow with an atmospheric type feeling then leads straight into an attack of melodeath reminding me almost of early At the Gates. This seems a lot more brutal and vicious than what you would find now on current Dark Tranquillity album. Featuring some melodic lead guitar work and some awesome riff work that seems almost black-ish in my opinion, but is obviously too melodic for more diverse than what you would normally find. The best part of this is the overall combination of Stanne\u2019s rasp and vicious offering mixed with the lead guitar work that is continued throughout the faster songs like Away, Delight, Away. The drumming here is also decent as well as the bass part, what you should expect from a melodeath band, some fun double bass and always varied but sometimes lacking it seems. The bass is noticed only once really, towards the end of With the Flaming Shades of Fall where it has some decent fills. \n\nAlone is a remake with Stanne from Skydancer and features a nice plodding, depressing atmosphere almost like a doomy melodeath song, which is a nice change of pace. Stanne IS better than Friden in this case. Having a depressing mood leaves you sorrowful and whatnot but still is an enjoyable song, nothing too amazing nor is it highly memorable; it\u2019s just there and is enjoyable as a song when you listen to it, but not a song I\u2019ll go back to listen to multiple times in a row. The production here isn\u2019t too amazing and is semi weak in comparison to later and newer work; some instruments aren\u2019t highlighted like they should be, and the vocals aren\u2019t in the forefront is what it seems, but the guitars are quite a delight to listen to with the fancy lead work.\n\nSo this EP is a nice recording of early Dark Tranquillity and Mikael Stanne\u2019s first work with the melodeath band, this is highly recommend for those hardcore Dark Tranquillity and Stanne fans, as well as those curious as to see how Stanne does better than Friden on Alone. Other than that, it\u2019s just a decent offering for hardcore fans or collectors only. It's one of those recordings you listen to and enjoy it at the time, but not care to go back out of your way and listen to it again and again. The songs on here feature some overall fun moments but isn\u2019t too highly memorable, I just wanted to see if Stanne tops Friden on the remake, and I think he did, now you decide.\n",
        "\nI've been browsing around this site for awhile, read plenty of reviews and used several to gauge my exploration into new bands. However, after reading the sheer amount of overwhelmingly positive reviews for Fiction, I had to step in and contribute, especially as I had planned to when the album was released. \n\n\nI enjoy the melodic death metal scene, and have since I picked up The Gallery and Character, the first two. While I've also explored bands such as In Flames (all the way up to Come Clarity, in which they tried to farm on the grounds they salted themselves), Hypocrisy, At The Gates, Kalmah, etc., Dark Tranquillity always stood out as a band who made memorable songs, shifted their music scheme and experimented with new things while keeping some good parts consistent (such as Mikael Stanne's voice, a certain level of 'epicness' that never reached lunacy like, say, Dragonforce, a MODERATE amount of keyboarding, which we will explore in a moment). However, when I picked up Fiction, I was baffled. \n\n\nAfter listening to the first track, I figured they were going to hide the better songs later on, like with Damage Done. I thoroughly enjoyed \"The Lesser Faith\", and it remains my favorite track, as it has a sense of forlorn grace to it, and a very good mixture of all instruments. Extremely catchy too. However, it was with that track that I noticed the keyboards were taking a majority of the spotlight, and were rather simplistic. Mind you, more recent releases, such as Character, used keyboarding, but it was not a dominant force in all the songs and had some level of complexity. But it seemed that the guitar work had been dumbed down to highlight Martin Brandstrom's ability to play one key at a time. Troubling, indeed. \n\n\nThis continued. Terminus had a familiar feeling to some of the slower songs on Character. But lots of boring keyboards, simplistic riffs, nothing spectacular. Blind at Heart had a good fusion of instruments and was upbeat enough to keep my attention. Perhaps Fiction could redeem itself? \n\n\nAnd then Icipher. What the fuck is up with the lyrics? Why does it seem like a sad ballad disguised with excessive palm muting? I did not approve. The composition was simplistic and mundane. Perhaps they should have swapped some of the track titles around. While I applaud our friends at DT for reaching into their inner feelings and expressing them, I would've suggested a side project. This heartfelt experience in failure continues, and peaks at Misery's Crown, where Stanne sounds on the verge of tears, perhaps upon the realization that Fiction was not only about to garner the attention of the emotionally distraught, but confuse and infuriate most of his former base. Awesome. \n\n\nFocus Shift definitely shifted my focus away from the last few tracks. I enjoyed that one, reminded me of older releases and times when selling out was something that only In Flames had mastered. And then \"The Mundane and the Magic\". As opposed to a number of the reviewers, I thought it was shit. When the female vocals plopped into place, I did not immediately think of Gallery. I thought Cradle of Filth. I thought I had absent-mindedly swapped CDs. So much for a focus shift. We have to wait a minute for the song to actually start, and about two and a half minutes in, I almost crashed my car while laughing at the pop-star female vocals spliced in between some of the most phony and goofy singing I've ever heard come from a guy. \n\n\nI am not sure why Dark Tranquillity leapt head-first into the bandwagon of recently shitty releases. I only enjoy Fiction for two songs, and was kind of disappointed otherwise. But to see that most of our faithful reviewers found this album to be lovely and perhaps superior to other, more skillful DT creations means either there's a hypnotizing quality to Fiction that I'm immune to, or we're all screwed. \n\n\nFor those new to DT, I do not recommend this as your only experience with their music. Pick up Gallery, Damage Done, Character, hell, even The Mind's I. Then come back and say this is the best there was.\n",
        "\n'Character' seems to be considered as something of a monumental step in the evolutionary chain of the gothenburg style of melodic death metal, perhaps even in the entire sense of the genre of melodic death metal. It becomes readily apparent when you ask people what the best gothenburg albums of all time are; 'Slaughter of the Soul', 'The Gallery' and 'Colony' will invariably be mentioned, and whilst I don't readily agree with these choices it's important to note that they came out around 1994, 1995 and 1999 respectively. It's a long time ago! Surely something must come along and revive this impotent and ambiguous genre! 'Character' is the chosen record of the blessed children of gothenburg; it has keyboards, there are riffs and lots of overt melody all over the joint. It also manages to be utterly devoid of talent whilst maintaining some sort of mental grip over even the more cerebrally inclined of the metal scene, which leaves me at a loss as to discerning just why this band gets recognition that it clearly doesn't deserve.\n\nThis album isn't an absolute void of creativity or talent; I mean it's most certainly not 'Fiction'. However that's because 'Fiction' is just a cardboard cut-out of this album, and thus since this album is decidedly below average that just makes 'Fiction' all the more worse for reasons that I shall one day articulate more effectively. The day I listen to that album again is the one wherein I decide to skip the nipple clamps and hot wax and just move onto the 'sick fuck' territory of masochism. Much to my surprise there are riffs on here that don't manage to conform the usual gothenburg standard of being simplistic, recycled and weak. The first song in particular, \"The New Build\" actually starts off with a nice round of tremolo picking and blast beating before moving into the more pedestrian metal riffing that borrows from the mid-90's rather than the much preferred mid-80's, i.e. thrash. The chorus however is very very very fruity, so exceptionally fruity that you can forgo that banana you were just about to eat and just listen to that chorus a couple of times and via energy wave based osmosis you'd get all the vitamins and nutrition you'd need for the day! Of course the side-effect is that you'll probably become some sort of raging homosexual and start listening to more gothenburg whilst indulging in gratuitous amounts of sodomy. There's also that melodic break in the middle, with some staccato power chords and keyboards which moves into a slightly different break but it's all the same really and is a waste of time. You could have quite happily put a solo in that spot and the song would be worthy of listening to, I'd ignore the fruity choruses by thinking about manly things and focus on the upcoming balls to the wall solo\n\nThe album only gets worse from this point, every song is just another adventure down the circles of Dante's Inferno, well it would be if there were 11 circles to the inferno but there aren't and I can't be bothered rephrasing this analogy because it's still appropriate. It's unfortunate that the band member's are not more attuned to \"The Divine Comedy\", had they been so I'm sure that the album cover would have \"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate\" scrawled across it in the mixture of blood, semen and cocaine; the remanent of the album release night, which was most likely fuelled by the money people seemingly throw at this band for the musical equivalent of passing kidney stones the size of gerbils. There are quite a few repeating pieces throughout this entire album that spell doom for the listener; the frequent dropping of guitars with an emphasis on vocals and electronica-based keyboards are one of the more disturbing and vile moments that try to make an appearance in nearly every song, I'm not sure why they bother to do this because it only emphasises the fact that the band are trying to establish some sort of obtuse vocal hook or perhaps highlight a lyric that only emotionally crippled morons would pay heed to, potentially taking onboard whatever enlightening message Dark Tranquillity wish to pass on. As previously mentioned there are the melodic sections that are mostly full of keyboards, sometimes with a trace of flaccid lead work that does nothing, or perhaps they'll include a nice round of power chords every couple of seconds. Funnily enough they always seem to appear around the middle of the song, as though these songs grow outwards from this central point of intense suck; the epicentre of suck. Actually I'm tempted to run with this theory since most songs start off on a good foot with either a decent riff, such as in \"Mind Matters\" before they descend further and further into worse riffage, more keyboards, bad choruses and then BAM! They reach the epicentre wherein lies their utterly desolate melodic section with their flowery, electronica keyboards pumping out something that wouldn't be out of place in a charity concert of ambient music for the deaf. Within the song \"Mind Matters\" it does quickly descend but hilariously enough around the middle the guitars start to play that initial riff again, as though the guitarists have been drowning and are racing to the surface to gasp at the air, of course the keyboardist steps on their heads as soon as they get even a second of fresh oxygen whilst gleefully cackling \"OH NO YOU DON'T!\".\n\nI think the most notable feature of this entire however, is the songs are devoid of personality; they all contain the same set of signature riffs that they bludgeoned from Iron Maiden, a certain degree of keyboards especially in the choruses, some superfluous lead work and the infamous epicentre of suck. They all follow a pretty set pattern of song structures, each song itself is around about four minutes long with the only notable exception being the final song which tops six minutes by just drawing out the formula even more by adding more and more melodic sections and keyboards rather than trying to be interesting; some actual riffs, maybe a couple of solos back and forth, perhaps learn to build suspense and make the song construct it's way towards a climax rather than hurling itself down a slope, tumbling on it's way to the pit of boring keyboards and irredeemably bad riffs. All those things just previously mentioned would be infinitely better than what the last song presents the listener with; \"My Negation\" is the finishing touch of this opus to mediocrity and ode to writing the same song eleven times. Its six minutes are nothing short of a cockslap to anybody whom has the slightest idea about heavy metal and what it should be.\n\nOne could quite easily summarise this album as having a few good riffs hidden sparsely about the landscape of intrusive and ominous keyboards, badly disfigured Iron Maiden riffs and double bass drumming, whilst the bassist is busy doing nothing and the vocalist lays down some decent vocals but can't seem to stop singing about the same whiny subjects ad infinitum. I always seem to be really rough on Dark Tranquillity but I can't help it, their claim to fame seems to hinge on the fact that in a time where their closest contemporaries began to sell out as a means of financial gain, they decided to simply homogenise their sound and still successfully appear more 'true' to the metal community but still produce music that lacks intellectual stimulation not unlike their sell-out contemporaries. Just because they sound different to In Flames and Soilwork, does not make them any more credible.\n",
        "\nHave Dark Tranquillity ever released a bad album? That\u2019s definitely up for debate, but what does seem certain is that lately the band has been delivering perhaps the most solid modern melodic death metal around today. Their competition, being of course, In Flames and Arch Enemy among some other lesser known bands.\n\nFiction more or less picks up from where Character left off in that there is no drastic change in the music. Although on some occasions (Misery\u2019s Crown and The Mundane And The Magic) we get to hear Mikael Stanne sing with clean vocals for the first time since 1999\u2019s Projector. Maybe this ruined the album for some radical conservative fans, but in my opinion the vocals work perfectly. Other than that Fiction contains some of the most aggressive work Dark Tranquillity has managed to perform for quite some time. Opener, Nothing To No One carries out all the aspects with some hyper-fast guitar riffs, forceful harsh vocals, and a catchy chorus including some piano. Definitely a highlight of the album. Dark Tranquillity are a good example of a metal band that use keyboards to their advantage. Some people seem to think that keyboards anywhere ruin everything. I don\u2019t quite understand this as I am under the impression, that if executed correctly, keyboards can add a lot to the music. Terminus (Where Death Is Most Alive) has keyboards, and I\u2019d like to hear someone tell me that song sucks. The album continues with stand-out after stand-out of what Dark Tranquillity have become known for. Mixing some really heavy music with great melodies.\n\nNew inclusions in the music would be (as stated above) the clean vocals in two of the songs. Misery\u2019s Crown features mostly clean vocals with some screams in the chorus. My personal favourite is the monumental and massive The Mundane And The Magic, which is also the closer. To me, this song is just a modern melodeth anthem. Old classics like In Flames\u2019 The Jester Race and Dark Tranquillity\u2019s The Gallery will unlikely ever be heard again. This is the new sound, and it\u2019s just as good. It features piano, melodic guitars, aggressive screams, and female clean vocals in an amazing chorus. Worth your money alone.\n\nDark Tranquillity are really keeping the genre alive with their recent music. This is definitely a highlight of 2007. If you are unimpressed with what In Flames are doing these days, I would strongly suggest checking out some new Dark Tranquillity.\n",
        "\nI got this purely as a novelty purchase, as it was available in an actual retail store (Hot Topic, I'll admit it, they have mainstream metal CDs for $10 typically) with a price tag of $.99. For that reason alone, it was a hilariously necessary purchase. What made it even more amusing was that it actually had one of those plastic anti-theft skeletons. The Hot Topic corporation really needs to protect their investments, I guess! Probably not a surprise when you have that many bad quarterly reports.\n\nSo apparently this was released as an 'ultra-limited' tour EP promoting 'Fiction', the Dark Tranquillity album that came out after 'Character' and is notable for being forgotten about two weeks immediately after its release. Judging from these tracks, I can sort of see why. They're not really BAD; they're pretty much an extension of the sound that was present on 'Character', but it seems to have gone waaay past that album in the more 'modern' elements (re: lots of bleepy and bloopy keyboards and electronic effects) to the point where it sounds a lot like Spineshank playing melodeath. It's kind of cool in its own way, but where on 'Character' the keys were used to augment the already very solid riffing, it seems that Dark Tranquillity decided they didn't really need to write riffs on the new album, opting for Dimmu Borgiresque one or two-chord chuggery. This means that the keys, while cool if obviously overblown, are pretty much the only interesting thing happening anymore. Neither of these songs are 'The New Build' part two.\n\nAside from that, it's pretty much what Dark Tranquillity has sounded like for a while now. It's not bad. If you see it for under a dollar like I did, you might as well get it just to marvel at the idea of a label putting this much effort into a two-song promotional EP and actually marketing it towards the public. It's a decent collection-filler if nothing else.\n",
        "\nThe obscure sound of a classical piano enters, penetrates my ears and I can\u2019t stop thinking: Is this somber sound typical of melodic death metal? Is this really Dark Tranquillity?... Well, it is. A lot has changed since \u201cThe Gallery\u201d, one of their greatest albums where the sound was harsh, fast but yet melodic.\n\nIf there was a Dark Tranquillity album that could be tagged as the most experimental and creative one of the band, it would probably Projector. The members took a great risk and it doesn\u2019t sound bad at all. They managed to mix some obscure goth \u2013 rock (perhaps goth metal) elements to melodic death metal. Between these \u201cgoth\u201d elements there\u2019s the low tone of the clean vocals of Mikael Stanne, who switches to the death metal growls that he has done in the last albums; there\u2019s also acoustic guitars, atmospheric synths, and a lot of delay and reverb effects for guitar. \n\nThis \u201cgoth\u201d approach is clearly marked in 2 ballad songs which clearly lack of melodic death elements. \u201cAuctioned\u201d and \u201cDay to End\u201d are two goth metal songs where there\u2019s no signs of death metal vocals, or death metal drumming. These atmospheric songs remind me a lot of some goth and even \u201cdoomish\u201d metal bands (Katatonia, and mainly Darkseed\u2019s \u201cDiving into Darkness\u201d & \u201cAstral Adventures\u201d albums) and the voice sounds like Depeche Mode at times, especially because of the vocal effects. \n\nAs you may be realizing, you have to be into depressive goth metal and melodic death to enjoy this album, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to people that are closed minded about depressive cheesy metal. The best songs and most representative ones are \u201cFree card\u201d, \u201cThere in\u201d and \u201cUndo Control\u201d, where the parts of clean vocals sound like well done gothmetal, and the growled parts sound like darkened melodeath. The song \u201cUndo control\u201d has three kinds of vocals because there\u2019s a guest appearance, so we have female vocals for this song (another goth element).\n\nIn a personal opinion I really enjoy this album, it has very deep vocals, catchy but introspective lyrics, and I like the sound of depression and aggression in the same song. Unfortunately, the only bad details of the album are these long atmospheric passages that some songs have, like \u201cThere in\u201d from 3:47 to 4:26 where is just a repetitive atmosphere piece.\n\nThis is the oldest goth/melodic death album I\u2019ve ever heard, I certainly know that some of their most devoted fans didn't like this change of sound, thats why I think it was a huge risk, but worth it, they also gain many many new fans. Some years after this release other bands of this genre came out with a similar sound, Fall of the Leafe being one of them and the Italian band called Dark Lunacy that took a more symphonic/gothic approach (Violins, Piano and classical string work) instead of the old school goth-rock of Dark Tranquillity in this particular album. Anyhow, the band improved eventually and evolved into something more agressive (Damage Done, Character)\n",
        "\nThe first time I heard of Dark Tranquillity was on Youtube, listening to there Monochromatic Stains clip. It was quite heavy when I heard it (I was still quite new in the metal scene) but I really liked the chorus. I started downloading songs and eventually the whole Damage Done album.\n\nI was really impressed with the mix of beauty and melody present on this album. I had already heard Soilwork and In Flames from the Gothenburg metal scene but this album was very different from both of them. No clean vocals with rip off chorus. Instead, DT showed us some awesome songs a bit more complex than the other two bands in the melodeath scene.\n\nThe whole album is awesome, the album is very consistent, therefore, in all tracks you\u2019ll find something intersting. You\u2019ll enjoy this album from the beginning of the trash intro of Final Resistance to the powerfull Monochromatic Stain, the brilliant Format C for Cortex, the quasi ballad The Enemy and the weird-but-still-cool Ex Nihilo.\n\nThe lyrics in this album are brilliant. The kind of lyrics that pushes you to understanding the meaning behind every word. It is not always easy to guess what Micheal meant through his lyrics. \n\nThe album was not focus on a specific instrument. The guitars are clear they are more used as rhythmic, no solos (except for Monochromatic Stains). The keyboard gives a good atmosphere to the songs. The drums are always used on the same tempo, not very fast nor very slow. The bass guitar can easily be heard, which is a good point. The vocals aren\u2019t fantastic nor boring. \n\nIf you are interested in melodic death metal and you are looking for something not as commercial oriented as In Flames then I recommend you strongly to take a look at this album.\n",
        "\nAfter showing the world what they were capable of, the strange and unusual arrangements came to a halt, and Dark Tranquillity took a more proper, direct approach towards their way of making music. Never has an album by this band sounded so strict and straight-forward, but rarely before has undemanding music worked as well as it does here either. What they do is pretty simple, but inside of the shielding boundaries that they create, they do absolutely everything possible to make it sound interesting. Restarting at ground zero, although it's a risky move, it sure paid off.\n\nFirst of all, the production couldn't be better. Of all the releases that major labels release, only a few really seems to fit music and production together as a whole. Without the clear-cut sound that is breathing freely into the sonic language the instruments speak the actual songs wouldn't work half as good. Studio Fredman often produces some great sounding compositions, but \"Damage Done\"\u00c2\u009d takes the cake. The guitars are perfectly distorted to fit the occasion. The drums work in a splendid way, instead of confusing you with their complex beats, thanks to the sound they keep you involved in what is going on behind the kit. Even the bass guitar (which usually drowns behind the guitars) can be heard to the extent that you constantly follow its pattern.\n\nThe songs are mostly great and have improved since \"Haven\". The aforementioned album didn't offer much to me, and I blame it on the songs. As I stated earlier, they've aimed for simplicity than anything else, which at the time was the right move for them. Everybody who's heard \"Projector\" knows what this band is capable of, and I find myself in delight hearing that they don't try to repeat themselves. There are way too many bands that do that. Unfortunately, the band members of D.T. stuck to their simplistic formula for a couple more albums, where they could've benefited from inventing new material. This is why this album beats it's successors straight down.\n\nWith that said, \"Damage Done\"\u00c2\u009d doesn't come without its flaws. Mikael Stanne sounds like a growling machine all the way from opener \"Final Resistance\" to his final performance on \"White Noise / Black Silence\" and does nothing at all to vary his act. This is without a doubt a big downer for most people, and of course for me too. There's nothing special about his voice to begin with, and when it becomes a monotonic mush after a while, it really can't be forgiven.\n\nAlso, whilst the simply structured may work, it doesn't work for 47 minutes straight. It would've been nice with something different once in a while, and believe me, there is no such thing to be found. Sure, there are major changes between songs, both in speed and style, but again it has its limitations. At a certain point, I begin to miss the old D.T. Fortunately they've done something unique with the last song. \"Ex Nihilo\"\u00c2\u009d isn't your typical way of an ending. It's not really an outro, and not an individual song, but something in between. Let's call it a passage. Anyway, this is the real reason why bands like this one maintains its standard in my book; atmosphere. They use just about enough of it to put me under a worshipping-spell. There's great melodies and melancholic ambience which grabs you, and doesn't let go before the last second of its playing time.\n\nI regard this release as one of the highpoints in its area. There's enough intensity to break your balls, but not enough variation to make it into the classics category. Even so, you should definitely buy it if you are interested in just how good Gothenburg-metal can be.\n",
        "\nAnother couple of years pass and another album is released by Dark Tranquillity. As usual, the quality\u2019s there and it\u2019s another good and consistent album. To be honest, this is quite similar to the last two but I like it more than those. Musically this is the usual post-Projector Dark Tranquillity. Well at least it\u2019s similar to Character and Damage Done as I haven\u2019t heard Haven yet. All three of these albums contain that slightly drier more modern feeling than the band\u2019s first two efforts, but don\u2019t think that this makes any of them weak. \n\nFiction continues with the now standard Dark Tranquillity formula of heavy melodic death metal with quite a good amount of keyboards thrown in the mix. These keyboards do an extremely good job of giving this album emotion. Half of it comes from them and the rest comes from Mikeal Stanne. The songs that shine particularly from this use of keyboards are Terminus, Icipher and Misery\u2019s Crown. Icipher in particular has one of the most incredible\u2026keyboard solos at the 2:30 mark. They make the album that much more emotive and powerful, and are used as to avoid sounding \u201ccheesy\u201d during the whole length. The band manages to blend keyboards and metal in a stunning way and as much as that might seem to piss off the last reviewer, I love it. \n\nMikeal Stanne continues with his usual vocals which just spew forth the lyrics in an incredibly powerful and emotional way. What pisses me off is that most people outside of the metal world don\u2019t realize this, only focusing on the growls and thinking this is brutal or something. Cannibal Corpse and Kataklysm are brutal. This is melodic. Well\u2026pop-minded retards, what are you going to do\u2026.Anyway, he\u2019s great. Also, for the first time since Projector, he does clean vocals on one track. It\u2019s Misery\u2019s Crown and as you might imagine, it stands out. Both his growls and his clean singing help make this track as dramatic and as emotional as modern DT\u2019s ever managed. \n\nNiklasson and Sundin\u2019s work on their guitars help make this album quite close to perfection, mixing very well with the keyboards and managing to create a unique atmosphere of melody and metal, the metal side being enhanced by Anders Jivarp\u2019s drumming, which is considerably heavier than of the last few albums, most notably Projector but also Damage Done. \n\nSo this is another great Dark Tranquillity album, not marking any important changes but instead continuing on the road the band embarked on during these last few years. There are only two flaws here: Fiction lacks the organic feeling of The Gallery and Skydancer. We can\u2019t really blame the band for evolving but this modern sound is simply inferior the original one. The other flaw, which also plagues the other albums, is that some tracks fail to really be noticed. Some are incredible and some are just there. But despite all this it\u2019s an excellent album and another step in the right direction by the band. At least they\u2019re managing not to sound overtly lame and mallcore like Soilwork or inconsistent like In Flames (whom I consider still very capable of putting out great music).\n",
        "\nWhen I first bought this album in 2005, I hadn't any idea of what to expect. I had heard of Dark Tranquillity and the constant praise that they received, but hadn't heard any of their songs. Searching the shelves of my local Best Buy, I came across \"Character\" and decided to give it a shot. I certainly was not let down by this blind purchase. When I uploaded it to my computer I was hit by a wave of fast-paced melodic riffing and intense melodic keyboards, accompanied by a great atmosphere.\n\nThe guitar work on this release is superb. Melodic riffing is most definitely present here, with some blazing-fast riffage very reminiscent of many melodic death metal acts from Gothenburg. The solos are awesomely melodic as well, but they aren't that plentiful, which is sort of a down side, as they are really good! The bass guitar does its own thing in the mix as well, not always following behind the guitar's lead, and due to the great production is heard very clearly. Speaking of which, the production of the album is nice and crisp, certainly one of my favorite production jobs on any melodic death metal CD.\n\nI've heard other Dark Tranquillity releases since buying this CD, and I can tell you that it's the same Mikael Stanne vocals; they are raspy, shouted vocals, and could easily fit in any melodic black metal band as well without a problem. They fit the melodic riffing and atmosphere of the CD perfectly, and I wouldn't change them at all.\n\nMy favorite trait of this release is by far the keyboard/programming work. Martin Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m does a superb job of giving me chills up my spine with his keyboard melodies, often complimenting the guitars with great melodic ferocity and epicness. There are no lightning fast keyboard solos or anything, in fact there aren't any keyboard solos at all, but damn do they create atmosphere!\n\nOverall, this is a highly recommended CD for any fan of melodic extreme metal, or extreme metal in general. Highlights: Lost to Apathy, Mind Matters, Am I 1?, One Thought, Senses Tied and My Negation.\n",
        "\nI hate you all, seriously all of you. Well most of you, if the scores for this album are an accurate survey of the opinions of this 'album'. Thanks to people like you I had to go out of my way to STOP listening to Destroyer 666, a band who is infinitely more talented than these keyboard-laden fucktards, then find a copy of this album, listen to most of it and then get irate enough to write this review at 2am in the morning instead of sleeping. I listened to this album earlier in the year and remembered dismissing it very early on, thus we arrive at now where after reading some reviews I thought \"Maybe I was hasty, best listen to the album again to make sure\". It sucked then and it still sucks now. In fact it sucks more because it's 2am at night and instead of skipping through ethereal adventures in my subconscious in my shitty, college-issue bed I'm sitting in front of my computer on a shitty, plastic, college-issue chair.\n\nHow this release has been considered as 'Album of the Year' is troubling. Off the top of my head I can rattle off a few albums, hell even an EP that is far more deserving of this title. Unless the criteria for 'Album of the Year' is; \"Beguiles fucktards into believing that it's a well-constructed album with decent riffs and controlled use of keyboards\" then this album is the equivalent to Lance Armstrong in the past seven \u2018Tour de France\u2019. Nile's \"Ithyphallic\" would most certainly take runner-up simply for being a piece of over-rated shit. To think that only two years ago we were going through the same song and dance with their previous release, \"Character\" which was hailed as album of the year, and in a few cases I had heard it mentioned as a milestone in melodic death metal or paragon of what melodic death metal aspires to be. When people want to express their love for an album they go straight for the hyperbole and pour it on as thick as molasses.\n\nThe problem with both of these releases is that the keyboards are far too prevalent. Since when did Dark Tranquillity turn into a death metal version of Sonata Arctica? Oh sure the keyboards aren't as flowery but they've practically turned into a forefront instrument and have a disturbing tendency to outright replace them during the choruses with the occasional quick bash of a guitar every couple of seconds. For the most part the gothenburg scene seems to be stuck within a state of arrested development, ever since At the Gate's swansong \"Slaughter of the Soul\" we've been given a set of simple but catchy riffs that the other two progenitors of the genre, In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, chuck into a blender with a few other chords or notes to produce their own riffs and perpetuate this stereotypical sound that everyone seems to think is ground-breaking and revolutionary. The next landmark in 'evolution' was the inclusion of keyboards which allowed these bands to write riffs that a seal having an epileptic fit could play and simply layer the whole section with keyboards.\n\nThat's not to say all their riffs are shite; there are moments that recall their early days and they manage to compose a good. Unfortunately the life expectancy of these riffs is a little less than that of a drummer for Spinal Tap. During 'Terminus (Where Death is Most Alive)' after wading through a terrible groove-based riff and some incessant keyboards we reach a decent little riff and in about 5 seconds they cock up the entire thing with a terrible riff. They return, yet again to that same good riff and then drive it into the ground and go back to the initial groove-based riff. Are these 5 seconds snippets of occasional brilliance supposed to be the selling point of an album? For metalheads with more than two brain cells to rub together there is only a stick and no carrot. The other problem in the guitar department is the lack of guitar solos. I can understand if they don't want a solo on every song but the fact is by the time I reached 'Empty Me' I can only remember two parts that were POTENTIALLY solos. Yes I'm not actually sure if they were trying to solo or if they just wanted to display that they had knowledge of the high E string and the frets lower down the bridge. They are a melodic death METAL band right? I just want to emphasise the metal constituent of their genre pigeon-holing because even the basic genre of heavy metal demands at least one solo every two songs, the more the fucking merrier I say. \"Hangar 18\" has something like 11 solos, that's more than this entire album. To be fair the two guitarists (they don't deserve names until I hear fucking solos) will probably never be Marty Friedman and Dave Mustaine, but you'd think a band that's part of genre infamous for bludgeoning Iron Maiden harmonies could at least pump out a solo every now and then.\n\nOf course I could be completely wrong, is there something I'm not getting? I may have only passed Year 12 English by 4% but even I can appreciate well-used keyboards and emphasis on atmosphere and melodicism as a means to convey ideas and stimulate thoughts. However Dark Tranquillity aren't Summoning, Burzum or any band who achieves such things. Therein is probably the most polarising thought about this album; what are they trying to achieve? Was the aim to produce something that was deep and reserved for pseudo-intellectuals who like to spout large words from thesauruses as they stroke their pre-pubescent facial hair? Or was this supposed to be balls to the wall metal album that just so happened to make use of keyboards to assist their perceived sound? If either or both was the intention then they've failed, but thanks to mindless fanboy-ism they've still made some money and people will sing their praises from the highest rooftops/message boards/whatever.\n\nIt's not to say that melodic death metal as a genre is completely devoid of talent, bands such as Arsis and Neuraxis manage to produce some amazingly talented songs. The gothenburg scene is running out of steam and its creativity was long ago exhausted, one can only hope these bands finally collapse in on themselves soon enough before they plague the world with yet another disposable and lack luster album. Don't buy this album, just because it's not as bad as In Flames' \"Come Clarity\" or Soilwork's \"Stabbing the Drama\" does not make it the best thing since some bored Thai hookers found a bag of ping pong balls lying around.\n",
        "\nThis album is a classic. An amazing classic, even if it is often underrated. \n\nThe first thing you will notice is the drumming which is powerful and never lacks of originality and technique. The guitars play a heavy and very melodic kind of death metal and sometimes leave place to an acoustic guitar intro or intermezzo (like in \"A Bolt of Blazing Gold\" and \"Through Ebony Archways\"). The acoustic guitar never sounds cheesy or out of place, it gives a note of sadness and melancholy, instead, and melts very well within the songs. I can say the same thing for the beautiful female vocals, which also appear in the songs above and sound quite tragic rather than meek.\n\nI suppose the hard point of this album is its complexity. Yes, because even if melodies could sound easy to catch by their own, in fact they get interlaced into each other in a tight frame. The music build is very complex and needs a siege of a few attentive listens to get really into it (or, however, that's how it worked for me). My supposition is also supported by some bad comments I found about this album from people pretending to do a dissection of each song, looking for nice pieces here and there.\n\nThis is the best way to kill this album. \n\nEvery song is filled with a great variety of melodies and each melody is important for the mood of the song. Usually riffs aren't repeated but they're often subjected to variations and trasportos. You really can't get bored of this music. If DARK TRANQUILLITY had released this album without lyrics, leaving just the istrumental part of each song, this would have been the same great album it actually is.\n\nIn fact the best adjective to define this album is baroque. You will hardly find something alike elsewhere.\n\nEven lyrics are elaborated and really hard to follow sometimes. As an example, take the lyrics on \"Shadow Duet\". In this song Mikael Stanne and Anders Friden play two consciences, residing in each man's mind. They undertake a (vocal) struggle for supremacy giving place at a kind of theatrical piece. \n\nThe last song, \"Alone\", is quite different from the average of the album. Slow death metal melodies and powerful depressive lyrics... a kind of doomdeath song (the strongest track in this album in my opinion).\n\nFinally, the production is the only thing you may dislike, being not raw but neither elegant enough to let the music completely unleash its power.\n",
        "\nHaving never released a weak or uninspired album since 1995, Dark Tranquillity comes back with another melodic metal masterpiece in 2005's Character. This new release is in a way a back to the roots album for the band. The speed of their first three albums comes back to the songwriting together with Stanne's higher pitched death metal vocals. The album grabs the listener from the first seconds and never let's go. Fast druming, with the inclusion of double bass and blast beats, melodic-sharp-heavy and thrashy guitar riffs, memorable guitar leads and solos, some memorable bass lines and screaming vocals, characterize the direction of this album. \n\nThere are some really outstanding tracks to be found on Character. \"The New Build\" is the perfect album opener as it features blast beats backed by heavy yet melodic riffing, screaming vocals and a strong chorus. \"Lost To Apathy\" is certainly the most catchy track to be found here as it is fast and aggressive, but greatly enriched by infectious melodic riffing, some remarkable vocals and an amazing chorus. \"Mind Matters\" is another catchy tune with a strong melody and a nice groove throughout. \"Dry Run\" features sharp riffing, varying drumming, atmospheric keyboards and Stanne's most memorable vocal performance on the album. The furious \"Through Smudged Lenses\" and the varying \"Out of Nothing\" are other album highlights.\n\nCharacter definitely has its weaknesses and the main one is that the remaining songs fall a little short, but that might be because they follow some truly amazing numbers. The album also sounds a little monotonous at parts, due to the fast pace of the majority of the tracks and the sharp guitar riffing. The last flaw lies with Stanne's vocal delivery which is not as deep and heavy as on the two previous albums as he rather follows the approach he used in The Gallery, which is higher pitched and more screamy. Although I believe that the guy is the most outstanding vocalist in the genre, he doesn't impress me that much on this release.\n\nSomeone might argue that the mentioned faults are nit picking, but they do hold back Character from being better than Damage Done. Nevertheless Dark Tranquillity should be applauded for making a back to the roots, heavier, faster and rawer album and thus keeping the tradition of altering their sound on every release. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.epinions.com website)\n",
        "\nThis here is a great example of melodic death metal done right. These guys have solid riffs, they have an original atmosphere, they have great vocals, and they have found a sound that they can call their own. The layered effects on this album are put to tasteful use and the result is quite simply beautiful.\n\nThe production and mix here is perfect! The atmospheric effects and the riffs are both brought out in tasteful equilibrium for the purpose of the album. There's a lot going on during each song, and it just adds to the song as a whole. Icipher, for example, is a song that features death metal riffing and harsh vocals, but also has a subtle piano playing in the background. The piano really adds to the atmosphere, emotion, and feeling of the song while not subtracting from the experience. \n\nThe song structure and the melodies on this album are tasteful as well. There's a lot of memorable lines here (on guitar, keyboard, bass, or anything else that does the job) that gives the song a more 'epic' feel. The vocals are all harsh, and behind them comes beauty with the instrumental layering and the band's excellent feel for song construction.\n\nIn conclusion, the only thing that needs to be said about this album is that from start to finish it's an enjoyable listen. There's 10 tracks on this CD, and 10 songs. There's no bullshit interludes or semen guzzling static intros to beef up the song count, which I really like in an album. Each song features great harmonized riffs, catchy vocal hooks (and guitar melodies), and most notably: a seriously epic atmosphere brought to life by tasteful keyboard use. \n\nI recommend this album especially for fans of Nightrage, but also to fans of melodic death metal in general, or to the open minded metal head for any genre. It's quite simply an enjoyable and well written album that belongs in a good metal collection.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity is one of the few bands that manages to alter and improve its sound on every new release. Each release since their \"The Gallery\" sounds different from the previous one but is still easily distinguishable as a Dark Tranquillity offering. \n\nTheir sound follows the Swedish melodic death metal recipe but it is still different from the other bands playing in the same genre (At The Gates, In Flames, The Haunted, etc). Fast, aggressive yet melodic guitar riffs and leads, pounding but also varying drumming, the perfect use and amount of keys and Stanne's low and high death vocals. The good thing about DT's songwriting is that it is not predictable. All songs are versatile, aggressive, melodic, progressive and technical all at once. \n\nSome fans and reviewers claim that 2005's \"Character\" is the bands strongest release since their 1995's classic \"The Gallery\"... well, I strongly disagree. Although \"Character\" was another masterpiece, it was fast paced throughout, rawer and not so versatile. It was definitely more 'death' than 'melodic death' and that similarity of tempo in most tracks resulted in a monotonous sounding release, in a way. \"Fiction\" IMO perfected \"Character's\" sound. There are still plenty of fast songs with outstanding drumming (with the use of blast beats aswell), down tuned and heavy guitar riffs and death vocals, but there are also passages within these same songs that are more atmospheric and incorporate wonderful melodies provided by keys, guitar leads and solos. \n\nSongs like 'Nothing To No One', 'The Lesser Faith', 'Inside The Particle Storm' and 'Focus Shift' are some of the best songs that the band has ever written. Even 'The Mundane And The Magic' which is the most simplistic and slow song manages to sound amazing due to the use of beautiful keys, varying drumming and the application of both female and clean vocals in the chorus. You will be certainly amazed by this album, it contains some of the best guitar riffs I have ever heard (you will be forced to head bang), melodic and technical guitar leads and solos, truly amazing (and not over the top) drumming and the best vocals of the genre! \n\nI honestly believe that \"Fiction\" is Dark Tranquillity's strongest release after the brilliant \"Damage Done\" and the experimental masterpiece \"Projector\". For any fans of the band and for any fans of metal this is a must buy. DT are still going strong after being active for over 15 years and haven't released a weak album yet. Congratulations to them... \n\n\n(Originally written for http://www.epinions.com website)\n",
        "\nRECENT EDIT: So, after several months of having Fiction, it has grown on me significantly and I consider it to be DT's greatest work to date. The score reflects this and most of the things in this review still stand in my opinion, it's just that the similarity between Character is there, only Fiction is MUCH BETTER.\n\nDark Tranquillity's previous effort, Character, propelled them back into widespread metal fame, truly making them the kings of melodic death metal, certainly compared to recent efforts from In Flames and other gothenburg bands. Ever since 2000's Haven, you could tell Martin Henriksson & co were searching for their sound, and it seemed that they found it on Character.\n\nNow they've found it, they clearly don't want to throw it away. While Character was indeed a fantastic album, this new effort is just too similar.\n\nSo, when I bought this CD, I popped it right into my CD player and laid back. At first I thought I was listening to a new Velvet Revolver album, which scared me for a second, but obviously after that in comes those ever-so-gorgeous sounding guitars, and we're off. Even from here you can tell that this album will be in a very similar vein to Character. Aside from some production changes (particularly to Mikael's voice), this could be stuck on Character, anyone could deeply analyze it and not notice a difference. The technical proficiency shown on the first track, 'Nothing To No One' is actually quite impressive, with Anders Jivarp whipping out a really tight blast and some strange timing.\n\nOverall Anders has polished up his craft. While most of the beats are very similar to things he's done before, when you compare between then and now, he's definitely better, with some more use of toms than before. However, he still keeps using a rather irritating splash (I think it's splash...) cymbal, it may just be taste but I really don't like the sound of it (listen to the second half of the chorus of The New Build to see what I mean). Of course this is a minor complaint, his blasting in particular has improved no end. Anders has definitely got his part in the band covered.\n\nMain songwriter Martin Hendriksson and art director Niklas Sundin have to do a good job on guitars for this record to live up to expectations, because they actually wrote most of the music, and because guitar work is really what shines in this genre. Unfortunately the solos on this album are very short, and while most are quite good (absolutely great lead tone) there is so much potential to extend them. Instead they often go into a breakdown of sorts, with a semi-nice rhythm to give the keyboards a nice hearing. While I am in no way criticising the use of electronics on the album, the breakdowns do get a little repetitive. I know they were used on Character as well, but normally to much better effect. The riffs are your standard fare DT, normally a quite low riff, a simple rhythm part and then the keyboards playing the main melody, but there are times where it is the guitar standing out (and normally this is how the best riffs are).\n\nMartin Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m and his 'electronics' playing (which basically means keyboards and synth) are not something that I normally pay attention to on DT albums (aside from the obvious parts like in My Negation), but here I'm forced to quite a lot, but this is not a bad thing, not at all. His melodies are always nice and the synths add an awful lot of power to the songs, especially when Hendriksson and Sundin are playing leads together. He has some nice sounds, which can always help keep the atmosphere and mood of the song (see: Icipher). The guy fucking owns on Terminus (Where Death Is Most Alive).\n\nMichael Nicklasson's bass peformance is solid. Again, the production gives him plenty of space to be heard, but unfortunately he rarely strays from the guitars (an exception is a moment in Nothing To No One which astounded me). If you listen closely though, you can tell his picking speed is very nice, especially when keeping up with the string skipping some of the riffs involve.\n\nMelodic death vocals are very much a love it or hate it affair (see Omnium Gatherum's new album), some trying very high pitched screams, others going for very brutal sounding growls. Mikael Stanne has always been a nice mix of the two. He can rip out a terrific yelp when he wants, and he always has nice variety, even when the rest of the music doesn't (more on that later...). The lyrics he has written are actually bloody astonishing. I've never paid much attention to the lyrics before, but the lyrics here are incredible. He addresses some important subjects, like war, religion and the environment, as well as some personal-sounding songs which I couldn't expect to really understand. Also, something which he's brought back to nice effect is clean vocals. They only appear on the song Misery's Crown (if you don't count Nell's beautiful guest appearance on the closer, The Mundane And The Magic). He has a great voice, and I hope he uses it more on the next album.\n\nThe song title 'The Mundane And The Magic' really does sum up this album. There are some dull songs (though I must say, a couple less than Character), and some flaws from Character that still haven't been sorted (too many breakdowns! Not enough lead guitar!), but the lyrics, vocals, drumming are absolutely brilliant. As I write what my overall opinion of Fiction is, it all depends on what song I'm listening to from it. If I'm listening to songs like Terminus (Where Death Is Most Alive) or Inside The Particle Storm, I'll say it's another top-notch effort from Dark Tranquillity, but if I'm listening to songs like Empty Me or Focus Shift (which isn't a good sign, considering it was the lead single) I'll say it's solid, but dissapointingly not enough of a change from Character. So, to decide I'll listen to a song which has its mundane moments and magic moments (The Lesser Faith, if you're curious).\n\nFiction is a good album. It has everything I expected, but unfortunately that's about it. Of course I had high expectations but unlike Character, they haven't been exceeded in such a wonderful fashion. Then again, Character is a tough album to beat. It's a great album to just listen to, but if you think about it too much you'll see it has some flaws.\n",
        "\nTo those of you who were thinking or maybe even hoping melodic death metal/Gothenburg was on the edge of extinction - how wrong you were! The legendary Dark Tranquillity, pioneers of the above-mentioned genre, has with their latest effort once again proven that melo-death is perfectly alive and kicking, even though their journey throughout the years was tough. A great deal of fans feared that the band\u2019s creativity and talent died together with \u2018Projector\u2019 in 1999, but refusing to give in the band continued along their experimental path all the way up to \u2018Character\u2019 (2005), which was proclaimed as one of the new masterpieces and milestones in the band\u2019s history. \n\nLuckily, \u2018Fiction\u2019 picks up just where \u2018Character\u2019 left us. The sound is carried by a pair of crunchy, down-tuned guitars and some extremely catchy riffs, which are being accompanied by Mikael Stanne\u2019s distinct throat instrument, and one can be content with his effort. \u2018Fiction\u2019 is the first album since \u2018Haven\u2019, where Mikael dares to make use of his clean vocal, which this time actually blends perfectly well with the rest. There is one development one can thank the \u2018Projector\u2019 era for; and that is the new dimension it brought to Dark Tranquillity\u2019s overall sound, namely the keyboards. But fortunately not the type, where the poor instrument undergoes rape and torture. No, it is being used to underline or add a haunting atmosphere, even a melancholic one at times. The drumming, although not as imaginative as one might wish for, completes the musical circle. \n\nFor me it all collide half-way through this piece of art; more precisely at \u2018Inside the Particle Storm\u2019, which can be seen as the epic track of the album. - Mellow, dark, but at the same time brutal in its beauty, it kicks off with slow guitar passage and quickly evolves into a more up-tempo, but sinister piece. The grandiose, melancholic atmosphere is recurring through the album. At the end it left me with an empty feeling inside, and when a band is capable of affecting me in that manner, they must have done something right.\n\nThe utter lyrical brilliance is also worth mentioning. I\u2019m willing to go as far as to proclaim Dark Tranquillity as the masters of composing brutal, haunting and gloomy lyrics. The band treats themes like death and despair and is therefore quite of a party killer lyric-wise. Nevertheless is \u2018Fiction\u2019 a must-have of 2007. Listen to it on a rainy Sunday, or just when you are in the need of beautiful, catchy yet edgy musical ride with genuine quality to it.\n",
        "\nBeing one of the few bands that emerged intact from the 90\u2019s Gothenburg scene, DT can be held up as a model for integrity. They continue to put out albums at a good pace and their material maintains the core elements of their sound mixed with just enough experimentation to keep it interesting.\n\nFiction, as expected, is made up of harmonized thrash riffs, melodic breaks, and dark ambient arrangements which create a sombre mood. If you\u2019ve heard even one Dark Tranquillity album none of this will surprise you. Tracks like Blind at Heart and Empty Me could have gone on any of their past releases. \n\nThe added spice on Fiction lies mainly in some experimentation with power grooves, most notably the intro riffs to Icipher and Focus Shift. These are really memorable songs, most of all because DT are masters at fitting new things into their sound, making you feel like these are simply classic tracks you had never heard. Drummer Jivarp freshens up the album as well with some well-placed blast beats. This is great because in the past the band floundered somewhat in the mid-tempos.\n\nStanne\u2019s vocals are solid and as always firmly rooted in the mid-range growl. His lyrics are the usual poetic fare, not really telling you anything specific but leaving you to contemplate while immersed in the aura of the band. A few clean passages are offered up on Misery\u2019s Crown and The Mundane and the Magic, and while welcome, are less effective than those on the band\u2019s B-side release Exposures. The female vocals on the latter mentioned track were a welcome surprise though, closing the album with a memorable and beautiful arrangement.\n\nIf you\u2019re already a DT fan, you\u2019ll love this album. If you\u2019re not familiar and are looking for a slightly (emphasize that word) more melo and atmospheric release to counterpoint your more brutal leanings, then this is for you. Dark Tranquillity are musicians of the highest calibre, delivering quality music with no gimmicks, presented directly and honestly.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity have returned once again and put forth yet another great slab of melodic Death Metal to help keep the scene alive. Throughout their illustrious career, DT have been at the head of the Gothenburg scene out of Sweden and unlike many of their counterparts(In Flaymez, Soilwork), they have stayed true to what they are about. Their style has significantly changed since their first couple of albums but not in the same commercial, trendy way of the two said bands. This change in direction sparked mixed reviews in some cases but in most cases, it is when their career really took off and they gained worldwide praise for their efforts. Thier 8th release entitled \"Fiction\" does not sway from this path. It incorporates many of the same elements that have been present on their past couple albums but yet, they have managed to mix it up much more here than before. There are noticable differences in style between albums like Haven, Damage Done, and Character and Fiction seems to take the best of each and combine them into a whirlwind of melodic death metal madness that will pull you in.\n\nThe opening track \"Nothing To No One\" grabs your attention from the start with its cutting edge riffs and then continues to draw you in until the chorus explodes in amazing fashion with an almost breakdown like section that manages to work quite well, with some great keyboards in the background to support it. The album continues in a similiar fashion as the keyboard layden tracks provide crucial elements to the music which form each songs base in a very emotional, catchy manor that will have the listener putting this album on repeat as you begin to pick up more and more from each song. The album continues to pick up speed as it goes and hits an early defining moment on the \"Terminus(Where Death Is Most Alive)\" that will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next as the song shows the harshest side of DT with great backing vocals during the chorus that is not heard too often from this band. \n\nHowever, this strong start is only the begining of what is to come when you are suddenly immersed by the albums climax just over the midway point on \"Inside The Particle Storm\" which opens with a beautiful guitar passage that leads the listener into thinking this could possibly be the most toned down song on the album until you suddenly hear the main riff come into play while the drums pick up speed and then are suddenly hurdled into a brutal but catchy series of vocals and atmospheric riffing that cultimates into an unforgetable song. After catching your breath from such a song, one would think that the album could not surely could not get much better and yet, DT suprises you and every song from this point on is nearly as strong as the last one. They continue with \"Miserys Crown\" which introduces more variety to the album with short passages of clean vocals that lead into a well crafted, brutal chorus that will have you wanting to join in. Next, their single from the album \"Focus Shift\" keeps the pace going with more hardlined riffing with quick changes that keep the listener on edge and fully enthralled in what is going on. And finally, the album closes with \"The Mundane and the Magic\" a song of emotion, intensity and variety, the perfect way to sum up the album and each of these elements cultimates in the final song to make it the perfect closer as the brutally and melodic riffing is still present while the chorus catches the listener off guard with female vocals(The first in quite a few albums) that provide a beautiful sense of melody and wonder as the album comes to an end while never missing a single step. Another masterpiece from Dark Tranquillity, essential listening.\n",
        "\nIf you're into any sort of melodic death than Dark Tranquillity is a band you've more often than not have heard. Most people even tout The Gallery as one of the best melodeath releases of all time. If you listen to The Gallery, and listen to Fiction you could say to yourself \"Is this the same band?\"\n\nThe fact these two releases sound so different yet are the same band, is bewildering. And might I add, they have had only one change in the line-up, and one addition to the line-up since releasing The Gallery. The progression they have tkaen between these releases (12 years), is amazing. Many bands lose their swagger and make really mediocre cd's, or simply just sell out to make some money (which for the record is ok, they need to make a living). Dark Tranquillity has managed to keep a style all their own, but craft a fresh, original sound. This release had the atmophere of Haven and Character, with the music sounding like a combo of Projector and Character. They carry over lots of elements from Character which is the best thing they could have done. The rather Gothenburg sound on Damage Done is present, but not overwhelming. The thing I'm really trying to get at is, they have combined all previous sounds and altered them into a new, simply fantastic release.\n\nSongs that have to be noted are Icipher, Inside the Particle Storm, and Empty Me. These songs oddly enough are right in a row. What makes these songs highlighs? Icipher gives you that Damage Done feel, but brings the presence of Character. It starts out with a really catchy melody, and quickly evolves into a darker, more depressing feel. The chorus is one youll want to growl along too, as with most of Stanne's vocals, they are very clear for a growl and really allow you to get into them. At the 2:50 mark, its just what separates these guys from the rest of the pack. A heart filled passage that perfectly blends the elements that make them famous. Inside the Particle Storm is by far the most atmospheric track they have done. Think of My Negation from Character and make it more sinister. It plods along in the most delightful manner. The piano in it greatly adds with its low keys and depressing tone. The chorus erupts suddenly, once you learn the vocals you will sing along the entire time, great song. Empty Me give off a Haven and Projector feel throughout. Mainly Projector with it's overall darker tones, with the Haven part being at the chorus, which is a slow yet brutal feel. This song highlights a part of their career where most people thought they had sold out because they introduced a few electronics and clean vocals. This song greatly reminds me of that era. The bridge and solo in this song is also my favorite off the album\n\nOn a side not, Mikael brings back his clean vocals in two songs, and they sound phenominal. \n\nAll in all, this release will be one my tops in 07, and features a ever-evolving side of Dark Tranquillity that I for one love.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity is without a shadow of a doubt the best band to come out of the much disparaged Gothenburg melodic death scene. The Gallery is an undisputed classic, whether you happen to like the album or not there is no denying the fact that it is a landmark release in the genre. To me it's among the best (or maybe even the best) melodic death album ever released. Character, released by Dark Tranquillity in 2005, comes very close too. That is not to say that everything they've come up with is solid gold by default, far from it. For example, The Mind's I and Haven aren't close as enthralling as what they can and have achieved. Still, even if most of their albums are not particularly amazing, they don't have any truly awful releases either and always manage to produce at least a few entertaining moments. This put together with the fact that they change their sound on every album makes every album release something to look forward to.\n\nAfter the very aggressive Character, Dark Tranquillity have chosen to take a step back and mellow out a little. Fiction is basically something of a mix between the highly melodic, keyboard-driven Haven and the easily accessible, song-oriented Damage Done, yet it is much more atmospheric than either of those albums. Songs like \u201dIcipher\u201d and \u201dInside the Particle Storm\u201d are perfect examples of this. The production kind of blends everything together into something that could almost be called a wall-of-sound, making it quite hard to distinguish some elements of the music, with one element rising over the rest to gather the attention, usually in tandem with the vocals which are the obvious main attraction in the music. One example is the way the piano melody accentuated by Stanne's growls take prominence over the nondescript and uninteresting mess during the choruses. In this case it creates a lovely atmosphere but it isn't the case with all the songs. How annoying it gets varies from time to time, and depends on both how much is going on and of what quality the \u201delement of interest\u201d is. Usually the simplicity is quite pleasing, but offers very little musically as the other instruments are overshadowed. Not that Dark Tranquillity are or have ever been a \u201dtechnical\u201d band to begin with.\n\nThe first track \u201dNothing To No One\u201d is a very good example of what Fiction has to offer. It starts off with a mid-paced pompous riff that along with the drumming has an almost symphonic feel to it and grabs the listener immediately. Upon hearing this the first time you'd think what follows is just as awesome but it becomes evident that the ideas end here and they repeat the same theme over the course of the song. Still not bad, but not stunning either. Same goes for \u201dThe Lesser Faith\u201d and \u201dBlind At Heart\u201d. The genuinely bad songs are \u201dEmpty Me\u201d, which has nothing to offer after the nice atmospheric pieces \u201dIcipher\u201d and \u201dInside the Particle Storm\u201d that are quite similiar to it, only done better, and \u201dMisery's Crown\u201d which reintroduces clean vocals we haven't heard since Haven and ends up sounding not only horribly out of place, but also terribly boring. Not everything is bad though, \u201dTerminus (Where Death Is Most Alive)\u201d with its insanely catchy keyboards (reminiscent of \u201dSenses Tied\u201d from their previous outing) is nothing short of being one of the great Dark Tranquillity tracks along with \u201dThe Mundane And The Magic\u201d which is easily the best closer they've done in a long time. This time even the clean vocals work well, both Stanne's and the guest female vocalist's.\n\nBottom line: great melodies, great vocals, and at times great atmosphere somewhat flattened by a bit tired songwriting effort. Though they are far into their career, Character proved that they are still capable of reinventing themselves and producing great material. But Fiction is not Character. It isn't even Damage Done, and providing the band will keep making music it will go down in the annals of metal as a work of lesser importance, just like \u201dThe Mind's I\u201d and \u201dHaven\u201d before it. Still, like those two albums, it has some value to offer and though it is not an essential purchase it will be enjoyed by any fan of the band. It has it's moments and also shows that even though the rest of the Gothenburg scene has sold out and the genre is filled with interchangeable worthless bands and copycats they still stand tall making albums worth listening to.\n",
        "\nWhen one is attempting to get into more extreme styles of metal, there are a series of paths which he or she could take. One could delve headfirst into brutal blackened tech death metal with some grindcore influences. Or they could ease themselves slowly. If the latter path is to be taken then there are several essential bands to start out with. Two of these acts are old-era In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. No, neither of these bands are really all that heavy or extreme, but it is a step in that direction. And though I would take The Jester Race over Dark Tranquillity's better albums, In Flames hasn't really done anything worthwhile in seven years (when they released Clayman). So that leaves only Dark Tranquillity as a source for some of the genre's more consistent works. And with their latest album, Fiction, they definitely deliver.\n\nTo be honest, Fiction isn't all that different from its predecessor, Character. Both in terms of quality and the actual music, the two albums are very similar, and to consider Fiction a continuation of the exploits found on Character wouldn't be a stretch in any imagination. But what does this Character-Fiction musical hybrid actually sound like? While it is not really all that complicated, as some of metal's more progressive acts, it isn't all that difficult to realize that there are multiple dimensions to the music. Songs like Nothing to No One and Inside the Particle display this characteristic, incorporating both ferocious, aggressive overtones along with a softer, more soothing atmosphere. Other songs, such as Misery's Crown for example, focus more on the sombre, heartfelt aspects of the band's writing. To accomplish such a sound, Dark Tranquillity taps into the talents of guitarists Niklas Sundin and Martin Henriksson for the dark, relentless riffing which for the most part compliments Martin Brandstrom's spacey, electronic work. The result is quite interesting and rather superb, as it catches the listener's attention and does not let it go for, well, the entirety of the 45 minute recording. Despite sounding similar to the band's past works, Fiction also manages to sound fresh and new, which is hardly a negative characteristic.\n\nSo, so far I've done nothing but praise Dark Tranquillity for their efforts on the new album. Yet, while a 85 is definitely a strong score, Fiction contains certain elements which prevent me from rating it higher. Though while one can go listen to it for the first time and love it instantly, the album still somewhat takes awhile to truly appreciate. None of the songs really stand out and grab you by the neck upon the first few listens. The aforementioned Nothing to No One along with perhaps Focus Shift should definitely impress first time listeners (of the band or the album), but it's difficult to immediately pick one particular track which is catchy and memorable right off the bat. Another issue that Fiction sometimes displays is the lack of individuality (for lack of better terms) between each track. It sounds as though Dark Tranquillity was resting on its laurels, as many a song has similar structure and, well, sound as another. Now, the famous quote which reads \"if it ain't broke, don\u2019t fix it,\" may ring true, as I did mention Fiction sounding fresh and interesting, but a little more variance wouldn't have hurt the album. All and all, these are just minor qualms and do not really distort my views of the album, but I feel if they were improved upon, that Fiction could be a better album.\n\nOverall, Dark Tranquillity's latest album, Fiction, does not really explore any new territory. Fans of the band (especially Character) will love it. Detractors (especially of Character) will hate it. All is right in the world. Ultimately, I feel that Fiction is a quite enjoyable, worthwhile collection of music and definitely an album to listen to if you want to get your feet wet with some of the more extreme metal genres. Perhaps one of the metal's stronger releases this year, Dark Tranquillity's eighth full length album is definitely an interesting album to check out.\n\n(Originally written fro Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nAll undisputed classic albums will inevitably have one or two reviewers that will pick it apart in a stubborn desire to go against the norm. A few people said this album was overrated, but note how few truly poor reviews there are. Ignore the naysayers, this is Gothenburg's best, and Dark Tranquillity's best. From start to finish every riff is epic melodic perfection, to say that this is all technicality and no songwriting is incredibly inaccurate, and there is in fact not much soloing or extraordinary technical guitarwork, if at all. Niklas Sundin and Fredrik Johansson are not Yngwie Malmsteens (who I happen to actually love). The vocals are perfect. Mid-ranged and raspy, there is nothing annoying about them, and you can understand almost every word. Accessible? Hardly. Progressive rhythms are present and scattered throughout the songs, especially in tracks like The Dividing Line. The drumming is fast and aggressive, this is not The Jester Race. This is melodic DEATH metal, not power metal with raspy vocals. And it is far better than The Jester Race, or Slaughter of the Soul for that matter. You wouldn't ever see Dark Tranquillity at Ozzfest or in Hot Topic, or in some mallcore kid's walkman. They are not In Flames, they are not Soilwork. This is what Gothenburg should be. \n\nPunish My Heaven is a great fast opener with beautiful finger tapped melodic guitarwork making an epic, almost neoclassical feel to the music, as Stanne growls along with his always melancholic and beautiful lyrics. The second track is more mid-paced, and leads into the similarly fast, aggressive, melodic, and epic Edenspring, one of the best songs on the album. The Dividing Line is melodic and progressive, highlighting rhythmic experimentation that would also be present on The Mind's I and occasionally on many further releases. The title track brings in some folk influence, with acoustic guitar and female guest vocals that were the highlights of Skydancer. The One Brooding Warning is a bit of a faster track that has its share of progressive tendencies, as well as a particularly nice guitar melody. Midway Through Infinity starts off with some blast beats and finger tapped melodies; now this is melodic death metal! Another one of the best, followed by probably the top track on the album - Lethe. \n\n\nLethe is, in my humble opinion, one of the most beautiful songs ever written. With epic, beautiful, and emotional lyrics that manage, at the same time, to incorporate fantasy and mythology, and music to match it perfectly, it is the defining track of The Gallery. Henriksson starts off with a long and epic bass intro that makes you see why he would eventually switch to guitar, before the other instruments come in, playing the characteristic melodic/neoclassical riffage as Stanne screams passionately along. The end fades again to bass, before exploding out abruptly with the final words. Perfection. The Emptiness From Which I Fed is a faster paced track in the vein of many other Gallery tracks that serves as a good bridge between Lethe and the epic outro, Mine is the Grandeur of Melancholy Burning. Mine is the Grandeur consists of acoustic guitar and tympani, making a very powerful and epic feel, as if the listener was in the middle ages walking through a sunlit grassy field. It fades into Of Melancholy Burning, which switches off between mid-paced but powerful riffs backed by Stanne's very powerful pipes, and faster melodic riffage in the middle of the song. The female vocals again add a nice touch, and as the song approaches its close, it transitions back into the riff of Mine is the Grandeur, and the album closes with a very brief and beautiful acoustic outro. \n\n\nIf you got the re-release, you get 5 great covers as bonus tracks. It seems impossible for Dark Tranquility to butcher a song. I have never heard Sacred Reich's version of Sacred Reich, but I love Dark Tranquility's. Bringer of Torture is a powerful Kreator cover, where Stanne actually greatly surpasses his primary vocal influence, Mille Petrozza. Maiden covers are often done by melodeath bands, and sometimes butchered. But Dark Tranquillity manages to make a very interesting version of 22 Acacia Avenue with death vocals that is a good alternative to the original. Lady in Black was so amazing that it made me want to hear the original very badly. I listened to the original and despised the annoying, whiny vocals. Stanne knows how to make a bad song good. And finally, it closes with My Friend of Misery, where we are treated to death growls instead of James Hetfield's annoying hick vocals. \n\n\nThis album left me craving more, and more, and more. I could listen again, and again, and again and never get bored. It might be a stretch to call it the greatest album of all time, but it is surely my favorite. And it is definitely the greatest of the Gothenburg/Melodeath genre. I would surely suggest it for any melodeath fan, and anyone who really craves a perfect epic blend of melody and aggression. Go out and buy it. Right now.\n",
        "\nI'm one of 'those people' who feel that Gothenburg took a massive turn for the better with the advent of the third millennium. The additional influence of electronics upon the community seemed to work wonders for it, at least in my opinion, primarily by drawing emphasis away from massively overblown guitars and distributed more evenly through the musical space. Of course, one of the highest profile examples of this would me Dark Tranquillity, whose material has improved vastly since their roots.\n\nDespite my dislike of albums such as 'The Gallery', 'Character' is right up my alley. I have no problem with saying that it's pop metal; that's seriously what it is. The music here is unabashedly poppy in nature (a song like 'Lost To Apathy' I could easily see doing well in the mainstream), but by focusing too much on that element, we miss what makes pop music pop: its quality. Obviously, that's a debatable statement, but the majority of pop music is appealing at least on the basest level to our senses because it uses aesthetics almost universally defined as appealing. Dark Tranquillity on 'Character' makes easy on the ears metal without sacrificing artistic and emotional credibility, resulting in beautiful, well-developed music that appeals to a very large audience.\n\nThe album seizes your attention right out of the gate with 'The New Build', a wonderful piece of highly melodic, modern death metal that, unlike previous Dark Tranquillity albums, is able to make you feel a real connection with the music. Lyrics that would seem cheesy otherwise seem compelling with Mikael Stanne's undeniably passionate delivery. \"I don't ever want to see you/Doing all the same things as me/Don't ever let this be you/Knowing what it is that drives me.\" Melodramatic? Hell yes! But Dark Tranquillity pulls it off, presenting their ideas and feelings with a drama that is clearly over the top but highly resonant and articulate in its careful construction. There is no understatement to be found on this LP, and it's all the better for it.\n\nPerhaps the most massive, dramatic, flawless moment on this album after 'The New Build' is closer 'My Negation', the bombastic, romantic production of which makes the exquisite melodies that much more potent. It's a highly tactile music, full of riffs (such as the chorus of 'My Negation') that cannot be played normally, but must be drawn from a pick being smashed across the strings in pure agonized artistry. Even if it is pretense, it's a pretense that makes you believe, which is the very most important aspect. The technical performances here are all highly stylish and capable, with highly developed sense of melody and rhythm that will ignite the heart of any metalhead that listens.\n\nWhile many will disagree with me, saying that Dark Tranquillity has fallen away from their roots, I'd agree with such a conjecture: Dark Tranquillity has indeed left their roots. And all for the better.\n",
        "\nYou have to realize that the derision that Gothenburg experiences is in no way unreasonable or senseless, and stuff like Dark Tranquillity's 'The Gallery' is precisely what causes such negative opinions of it. What's the typical Gothenburg stereotype: too much sugary melody, melodramaticism, dueling solos, tom fills, too much every damned thing without any restraint whatsoever. 'The Gallery' is the biggest walking stereotype of Gothenburg melodeath after 'Lunar Strain', and it's no wonder that I hold so much resentment towards it.\n\nEverything is soloing. There are no 'riffs' on this album, just an endless series of more or less complicated soloing that taps out melodies of Sweet 'N' Low flavor that causes most people to jump for joy but me to retch. The guitar tone is sickeningly sweet and jangly, just like the production which retains a crystal clarity with almost zero personality. The name of the genre is completely illegitimate. There's no 'death' to be found here, and omitting that word seems to result in a much more logical label: melodic metal. So melodic that any trace of brutality or intensity is conspicuously absent.\n\nA modicum of aggression does not death metal make, and it applies quite easily to the drums and vocals here. The former taps away with a predictable series of skank beats and tom fills, while the latter, despite 'growling' in a mildly inaccessible way, seems to be halfway pop crooning with an overly emotional delivery that doesn't quite mask the inherent sterility of the music on this release. Why the hell is this legendary? There's too much technicality and melody and not enough genuine songwriting. Dark Tranquillity on this album has a massive case of Opeth Syndrome; beautiful portions that have absolutely no connection to each other.\n\nEnjoyable parts are few and far between. 'Edenspring' is probably the best, packing the most logical and quality riffing. 'Midway Through Infinity' is also enjoyable for similar reasons. However, on the exact opposite end you have stuff like 'Punish My Heaven' with its constant atonal noodling, or '...Of Melancholy Burning', with its horrifically warbling female vocals that add nothing but horror to proceedings, and not in a cool way. No matter how many times I listen to it, it stays just as underwhelming and boring play after play, offering nothing new, despite the 'depth' of the music here.\n\nIf you get the 'Deluxe Addition', you get to wander through an additional five cover songs that are truly hit or miss. The good: 'Lady In Black' and '22 Acacia Avenue', both of which maintain the intensity and beauty of the originals. The rest are rather average renditions that just play through the tabs without retaining any of the meaning.\n\nI've never understood why 'The Gallery' is viewed as a classic of the Gothenburg scene. Granted, my position against the scene in general may give me a predisposition against it, but there are numerous examples of melodic death metal that is far better than the material on this album. While some who are infatuated with the genre may enjoy it, it's simply not my thing. Make of it what you will.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity are in full stride now \u2013 with the fan and critical acclaim of Character it was up in the air on whether or not they would be able to match or overcome the success. Dark Tranquillity definitely proved that they are willing to even try to match but that they can. \n\nFiction is full of both melody and ferocity as only Dark Tranquillity can write. The music is written in a way that is catchy and heavy. When listening to Fiction, one will find themselves really getting hooked on the melodies (both guitars and keys) but head banging to riffs and drums.\n\nThe guitar work is faster and choppier as it was with Character but there are also songs with breakdowns that sound borderline Fear Factory (Terminus comes to mind). The leads and solos are well placed in the music \u2013 and very emotional. Emotional and heavy music has always been something that Dark Tranquillity could pull off \u2013 but this album feels both angry and sad at the same time \u2013 just by using their guitar tone. I found myself really getting into some of the speedier riffs. Although the melodic tones of Inside the Particle Storm and The Mundane and The Magic are amazingly catchy.\n\nThe drumming and bass work is well written although both have their faults. The bass is well done but is lost a lot of the time within the music (not to too much dismay) and is overridden by the drums and guitars. The beginning of the album started off with a killer bass line and drum part and I expected that to continue as a theme throughout the album \u2013 but it didn\u2019t. The drumming is well done death drums without too many blast beats but without sounding outside of the death metal realm. The one complaint about the drums is production wise. Sometimes the snare drum sounds very hollow and it would pull me out of the music. It\u2019s a nit-picky thing that one shouldn\u2019t take too seriously.\n\nVocally, Mikael Stanne is still one of the most talented death vocalists in the scene. He sounds heartfelt in his vocals without losing that death edge. His voice is relatively understandable in the death metal world and borderlines thrash harshness at times. Two particular vocal moments caught me off-guard on Fiction. One was the return of Mikael\u2019s singing (Misery\u2019s Crown) and the inclusion of a female vocalist (The Mundane and The Magic). Both are good contrasts to the normally harsh vocals that Dark Tranquillity uses \u2013 and both do not falter the music in any way.\n\nOn a final note, this album has some of the best flow for an album that I have heard in a long time. Songs seem to flow into one another well but they don\u2019t really overlap and meld. It\u2019s a well constructed album without losing the individuality from track to track.\n\nDark Tranquillity has definitely matched the musicianship presented to us on Character. This album is not as harsh or angry (in general) but it definitely is matching to the glory that was Character.\n\nSongs to check out: Nothing to No One, Terminus (Where Death is Almost Alive), Focus Shift.\n",
        "\nZodijackyl Light is a great simultaneously speedy, aggressive, and melodic song. It's a very strong opener and a good song choice for DT to make a video for, and repeat on the next album, The Mind's I. It's obviously the same band that made The Gallery, with melodies that are just a bit less epic and a bit more dark, and some progressive rhythms thrown in for spice. Cool. The ending is weird, it's some weird techno programming that fades in between the first track and Razorfever. But in the context it actually sounds pretty cool, and manages to be powerful and effective when the thrashy opening riff to Track 2 comes in. Razorfever even manages to have some Gallery-esque real epic leads thrown in. It definitely sounds like it could have been something off it, or the Of Chaos and Eternal Night EP. That plus the aggression makes a really great song - the clean part also sounds really awesome. Both the first two tracks are kind of new and experimental but both get a 10/10 in my book. The third track, Shadowlit Facade, continues the strength of the first two. This is a mid-paced ballad type song that, in fact, sounds like it came right of The Gallery. That's probably why it was put on this EP and not The Mind's I. Though I have not yet written a review for The Gallery - know this: sounding like it is a good thing. This song has no flaw. \n\nNow we get to the WTF part. After those three extremely strong songs that should have been either the entire EP or a single for Zodijackyl Light or something, we hit Archetype. This is the worst Dark Tranquillity song ever made, unless they somehow get really bad in the future. But as of 2007, it's the worst. It is techno. Straight up techno, with a programmed drum beat, some stupid synthey bass and programming crap, and samples of some of Stanne's screaming from earlier songs. Now, it's kind of a fun song, and not completely unlistenable, but it is a complete bastardization of the epic beauty that is Dark Tranquillity. I am glad the most experimental they ever got was Projector, and they never went this far *shudder*. So if the EP was only three tracks, it'd get an 100. But for that last one, I have to downgrade to an 85. This is worth getting for a hardcore fan I guess, if you get it on The Mind's I re-release. Otherwise just download the first three tracks and go buy The Gallery.\n",
        "\nI managed to get this album from my friend before it came out, and being a real die-hard Dark Tranquillity fan, I had to listen to it. After hearing \u201cFocus Shift\u201d on myspace, watching the studio report video, and the live video of new material, I had pretty high hopes for this album. But I didn\u2019t think it would be as good as it actually was. There is no question that I am buying this album when it comes out despite having the mp3s previously. Overall, the sound is very Character-esque. Some people like me prefer the older, more classical/folk type material, and some prefer the new. If you prefer the new, this will probably be your favorite DT album, and if you prefer the old I don\u2019t think you will be terribly disappointed. On this album, it seems like Dark Tranquillity took all the highlights of each album since Projector and combined them into a very impressive new sound. This album is as heavy and thrashy as Character, while remaining more melodic and as catchy as Damage Done, with some of the gothic atmosphere of Haven in calmer songs, and what is this? Projector clean vocals? And even that female guest vocalist returning on the last track? This is pretty exciting, and for those of you who don\u2019t like Mikael Stanne\u2019s clean, it has not only improved, but isn\u2019t overdone, appearing only on two tracks. \n\n\nThe opener, Nothing to No One builds up with first bass and drums, and it\u2019s nothing incredibly technical, but the power of the bass and the fact that it was actually quite prominent really impressed me. From there it starts to sound very Character, with Mikael Stanne\u2019s always great death growls; tight, aggressive drumming (yes, blast beats), atmospheric keyboard, and thrashy rhythm guitar with melodic leads. This and the next track, The Lesser Faith, share this sound of more melodic Character. Something I also noticed that I really like is their keyboardist/electronicist has been using more piano type stuff and less techno. Dark Tranquillity will never sink to the level In Flames has. Terminus (Where Death is Most Alive) is very reminiscent of Damage Done, being extremely catchy, with techno background that doesn\u2019t take away from the guitar lines, and the type of chuggy riffs that were in songs like Monochromatic Stains. Blind at Heart has to be my favorite song off this album. It has some very impressive lightning-fast picking patterns in the rhythm guitar, blast beats, and an addictive, catchy chorus. The harmonics sound cool too. Then something surprised me. Sundin breaks into a typical DT melodic lead, but then\u2026what is this? Shredding? Yes, shredding. It doesn\u2019t last very long, but he actually does a nice short thrashy solo here that is completely not typical of Gothenburg. Icipher closes off the first half of the album as a more mellow mid-paced track with an atmosphere reminiscent of Haven, but chuggy and powerful guitar unlike that album, and a good melodic lead. There are also some progressive rhythm patterns that appear on most DT albums that spice it up (good examples are Mind Matters from Character, Of Chaos and Eternal Night, and Zodijackyl Light from The Mind\u2019s I).\n\n\nInside the Particle Storm continues with the mood of Icipher as an atmospheric gothic song that manages to be far more effective than anything off Haven, with the clean guitar and keyboards being especially beautiful and epic. Empty Me wakes up the listener by returning to the Character/Damage Done melodic thrashiness with blast beats and catchy choruses. Misery\u2019s Crown is the Projector-esque song on this album. And I must say, I really like Stanne\u2019s clean, but I really love them in this song, it seems like he has improved a lot since Projector. It\u2019s very nice, melodic, and soothing. The second-to-last song is Focus Shift, a great modern melodeath song that was the first one to be released from this album. As the shortest song on this album and one of the catchiest, it\u2019s a good choice for \u201csingle\u201d material \u2013 in a good way. Although it is odd that DT puts it so late on the album, it\u2019s good to have something upbeat among the calmer, more gothic second half. The Mundane and the Magic is an appropriate closing song, calm and more gothic like some of the others in the second half, with those Projector-esque clean vocals. They also seemed to have saved the biggest surprise for last \u2013 the return of those female vocals that appeared on all the early albums but hadn\u2019t since Projector. It works well. \n\n\nOverall, this is a good mix of newer DT material and as good as any modern Gothenburg is gonna get. Fuck In Flames and their horrible experimentations with nu metal, techno, and emo, fuck the shattered remains of At the Gates that play mallcore with The Haunted, and fuck all the copycats, DT is the way to go.\n",
        "\nThe Mind\u2019s I\u201d represents an unusual period for Dark Tranquillity. After the release of the masterpiece The Gallery, the band began to head away from the epic classical-influenced melodeath sound of that album towards more progressive and gothic tendencies. The Enter Suicidal Angels EP features some experimentations with electronic programming (transition from Zodijackyl Light into Razorfever) and even a straight out techno song (Archetype). A very strange release indeed, after The Gallery. The Mind\u2019s I finds the band not taking such an extreme approach as the EP did, but it can be seen that the epic melodies are being dumbed down a bit in favor of a darker, more progressive sound. Make no mistake, this is the bridge between The Gallery and Projector.\n\n\nThe first track, Dreamlore Degenerate, is a short burst of aggression, with some slower parts thrown in. The subtle tempo changes in this song prepares the listener for much more extreme ones that follow. Zodijackyl Light, a track from the Enter Suicidal Angels EP, isn\u2019t too far removed from the sound of The Gallery, but is a bit stranger and more experimental. During the chorus, there is an extra half beat every other measure, making the tempo rather strange and confusing. Near the end of the song, a typical hi-hat/snare beat is played against that riff for a very strange feel. It\u2019s almost \u201cmath metal\u201d. The third track, Hedon, is definitely my favorite on the album. A darkly epic masterpiece, Hedon has bizarre tempo changes coupled with multiple leads and great vocals and lyrics. Unfortunately, Dark Tranquillity doesn\u2019t manage to make all the rest of the songs on the album as interesting. Scythe, Rage, and Roses is another short burst under three minutes, like the opener, that is a bit faster than the other songs. However, the thing about these short bursts of aggression, is they don\u2019t feel all that heavy or powerful, and aren\u2019t quite as effective as they could be.\n\n\nConstant is a slower track with some decent leads and not many interesting tempo variations that ends up being pretty good but nothing too special. Here comes another one of those token shorter faster songs to keep you awake\u2026Dissolution Factor Red. Starting to get a bit redundant here, unfortunately. To keep your interest, Dark Tranquillity throws in one of those classic half-acoustic songs with female guest vocals, Insanity\u2019s Crescendo. And for a while it\u2019s pretty, but isn\u2019t executed nearly as well as earlier epics like \u2026Of Melancholy Burning. In fact, 7 minutes of it is a bit much. I tend to get a bit bored after that. Still Moving Sinews is a decent song with some decent leads and such, but a bunch of decent songs put together to make a decent album doesn\u2019t do much for me. Atom Heart 234.5 has a bit more of that fast stuff, but overall none of these tracks nearly match the power of anything on The Gallery. Tidal Tantrum\u2026mid tempo melodic leads and switching off between clean and distorted guitar\u2026not bad on its own but I\u2019m really getting bored here. Tongues isn\u2019t much different either. The closer and title track is a great track, but by the time you get to it you\u2019re more than a bit bored. A good mix of old and new, The Mind\u2019s Eye is acoustic with sampling and electronics in the background. Definitely a good way to bridge the gap between The Gallery and Projector.\n\n\nOverall\u2026the first few tracks are pretty damn good, but then the damn album just starts to drag. It\u2019s not that these songs are bad, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re not that amazing. Pretty good for a transitional experimental album\u2026but I\u2019d take any other DT album except Haven over it. Skip this one unless you\u2019re a real hardcore fan (like me).\n",
        "\nThe one thing about Dark Tranquillity is their uncanny ability to change the slighest aspect of their music on every cd and sound different. This would be called progression of music. And like most successful bands they do this a lot. After Projector (which was a most unique and amazing release in its own right), Dark Tranquillity went heavy on keys with Haven. Not for everyone but it gained, lost, and kept fans. Next was Damage Done that was more of that trendy Gothenburg sound. Again although it followed a trendy sound it was not a bad release. Now we have this slab of Dark Tranquillity, Character.\n\nTo put it simple. They took the Gothenburg sound from Damage Done, made it darker and heavier. Combined with watered down, but never boring key passages from the likes of Haven.\n\nEssentially altering their sound. Best of all it works, it works damn well. Everything about this cd screams they still have a long career ahead of them. Almost 20 years in the business and constantly changing sounds, keeping up with the young guns and best of all making music worth while. Songs like Out of Nothing just show a side of Dark Tranquillity not present in a long time, if ever. The sound is mean, the bass is stuck in your head. The riffs are catchy as hell, yet never get to cheesey, hell they use riffs at times only 3 times than discard them. The keys are tastefully done, they don't have that power metal feel that Gothenburg bands seem to love. If anything they add to the modd and atmosphere as they should. Vocals as usual are top notch ranging from low to mid to high. There's no words that havent already been said to describe Mikaels steller vocal performances. The drumming at times gets boring, but never to the point where you notice it. Only if you're being very picky reviewer. \n\nMind Matters is another song that will take you deep into the musical world of Dark Tranquillity. This song in particular is how I think they will progress forward in their next effort which is due out later this year. The music is agin dark, yet maintains that sublte calmness. It almost feels as if this song could go to a sci-fi movie. The overall tone of the song give you that futuristic atmosphere. Again all the instrumentation performances are top notch, I really hear no flaws whatsoever. Best of all this song stands out on an already stellar album.\n\nMy Negation has to the standout song on the album. It's not the best song., but just not the style song you would expect from Dark Tranquillity. From listening to the rest of the album, you do hear a decline in speed from the band. But when you hear My Negation it's almost ballad type slow. The darkness and dispair combined with the melodic death metal elements ar still present tohugh, just toned down to a slow tempo. Some might love this others might not because this type of song is usually reserved for Doom metal. Yet this is far from a typical doom metal song.\n\nAll in all this album is thier most complete since Projector. They incorporate new elements every cd, and hit a gem with this one. With another release of this caliber Dark Tranquillity will solidy their place in metal history.\n",
        "\n(Note: I originally write this on Amazon.com on June 1st, 2006.)\n\nI believe I'm not alone when I argue that Dark Tranquillity's '95 album \"The Gallery\" is the cornerstone of the Gothenburg melodic death metal sound, as well as the album that took it into a different dimension. This album has the trademark harmonies, melodic solos, occasional female vocals, and a stellar production; but at the same time, it's not \"straight-up\" melodic death like In Flames early albums or old Arch Enemy. No, \"The Gallery\" has a progressive feel to it, and a somewhat Gothic atmosphere to it. (I would connect this to Stanne's lyrics.) Dark Tranquillity use a technical flair on this album not found in many metal bands; meaning that the transitions between the riffs are kind of weird. You know, the type of thing where just as you're getting into a nice riff, it switches up on you, and you're taken by surprise, finding yourself saying, \"Woah, didn't see that coming!\" However, it's not self-indulgent and the technical moments seem to make the album deeper and keep things interesting, rather than just trade riffs back and forth. For instance, \"The Dividing Line\" starts off with a strange, amorphous drum pattern leading a jagged guitar lead, but right after this, the boys kick it into high gear with ass-kicking harmonies in true Gothenburg style. \n\nMy love for the guitars on this album is unfathomable. From the gorgeous interlude \"Mine is the Grandeur\", which tastefully utilizes three classical acoustic guitars (harmonizing with each other, of course) and booming timpani drums, to the epic yet somber \"Lethe\" and the frantic neo-classical solos on \"Punish My Heaven\", it's total perfection. The display is not totally virtuostic, and the harmonies add so much impalpable atmosphere to this record. The bass playing is superb as well. Instead of playing regular root notes, the bass seems to be a totally independent instrument by itself, as seen on \"Edenspring\". \n\nOne of the greatest things that grabbed me about this album was the drumwork. The listener doesn't get pummeled to death with double bass overhauls or endless thrashfests, but the drumming firmly supports the music. To sum it up, it's technical, intricate, but not over the top. Anders allows to music to breathe, and his odd patterns add a lot to the music. \n\nStanne's voice here is his best, I think. His raspy screams are at his emotional heighth on \"...Of Melancholy Burning\" and the vicous \"The Emptiness From Which I Fed\", and his lyrics are far from the metal norm. You can feel the sorrow through his screams, and he doesn't try to be another Anders Friden clone. There are some occasional clean vocals, and the female vocals on the title track work perfectly, giving the album even more of an epic feel. \n\nThis is definitely an essential metal album, and I would place it in my top 5 of the 90's. Pick up at all costs.\n",
        "\nDon't get me wrong, I can see where a lot of folks go wild over this album, as it is indeed varied and well-played/produced. But at the same time, I fail to see why it's considered so great. I much prefer DT when Mikael Stanne is snarling and the riffing is there and the drumming is spot-on, that is, when they are in full-on metal mode. \n\nAnd there are moments of that for sure on this album: \"There In\" has an ear-grabbing flanged opening riff that should've been the album starter as opposed to the slow and moody \"Freecard\", and it brings the heaviosity but good with a slamming beat and--for once--a solid and audible bass presence. \"Dobermann\", well, like most other folks, that lovely Iron Maiden-like opening guitar part gets me going every time, and the lyrics are fascinating, cryptic though they are. Those two songs are my absolute favorites, and while there are a couple of others I can get into at the right time, the rest of this album tends to be too soft and restrained for my taste. Too many mid tempos and not enough variety; too much \"groove\" sounding riffs for my taste, unfortunately, are on this album. \n\nAnd I really prefer Mikael's menacing snarl on the vocal front, he sounds distinctive and more coherent than the average grunter/growler. He sounds entirely too goofy when he goes into clean vocal mode. Too much like Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan, and I never got into DM, so this is a bad thing for me. Fortunately, he alternates that with enough growling to make it somewhat bearable. \n\nAgain, this is not a bad album by any means. The guys can obviously play well and the production is perfect (thank you, Fredrik Nordstrom), but the material is lacking variety and energy in my opinion. The albums that followed this were much better, IMO. I just prefer my metal to have light AND shade as opposed to all shade (too boring) or all light (too happy), you need to have dynamics to make this work. And \"Projector\" unfortunately lacks the kind of dynamics that would make it a really killer album. Sorry to say it, but it's too soft for me.\n",
        "\nWith the 1993 debut Skydancer, Gothenburg death-metallers Dark Tranquillity showed they were competent musicians of the emerging style of melodic death metal, along with their contemporaries At the Gates. With the departure of vocalist Anders Friden to In Flames, the switch of guitarist Mikael Stanne to vocals, and the recruitment of new guitarist Fredrik Johansson, the classic lineup that would create the masterpiece The Gallery, the progressive The Mind's I, and experimental Projector, was formed. \n\nThough stylistically not much different than Skydancer, this EP would end up being better in every way, and setting the foundation for the pretty much flawless The Gallery. Mikael Stanne is a far better and more powerful vocalist than the relatively weak and mediocre-at-best Friden (who would go on to destroy In Flames), and Johansson was a more than worthy replacement for him on guitar. Another noticeable thing about Of Chaos and Eternal Night is the improvement of Jivarp on drums. He no longer sounds as awkward and sloppy as he does at some points on Skydancer, executes his blast beats pretty well, and keeps the beat to mind boggling tempos. \n\nThe first track and title track, Of Chaos and Eternal Night, is a masterful blend of melody, aggression, and technicality. Most of the drumming is blast beats, and it is chock full of Gothenburg-style melodic leads, at a faster pace than In Flames would ever do. The vocals are quite powerful, as Stanne's death vocals always are, and near the end of the song it enters a series of mind-boggling tempo changes, which Jivarp astonishingly manages to keep a beat going to. Particularly cool is the brief transition into a relaxing 3/4 waltz-type beat, before exploding into the end of the song, and stopping abruptly. The second track, With The Flaming Shades Of Fall, moves at a much slower pace, and manages to be a very relaxing and melodic tune, still with Stanne's harsh vocals, and some nicely done spoken word near the end. Away, Delight, Away speeds it up again, not quite to the pace of the title track, and focuses more on melodic lead guitar work than strange progressive tempos. Stanne executes his spoken word rather well again, and the beautiful melodies carry the song along.\n\nThe final song, a remake of Skydancer's closing ballad Alone, is my favorite Dark Tranquillity song of all time. Written with beautiful counterpoint-style guitar work and deep, powerful lyrics, the only flaw of the original was the horrendous vocals by Anders Friden. Indeed, the only thing changed about this version is the vocals, and it is quite a difference. This song clearly illustrates the superiority of Stanne as a vocalist, and closes the EP well, as the previous had closed Skydancer. \n\nOf Chaos and Eternal Night is a short EP with a long name, but it is not to be overlooked. Fans of The Gallery, or classic melodic death metal in general, should check this out. As the first release of the classic DT lineup, and the forging of the epic sound that would define The Gallery, it's quite a milestone.\n",
        "\nThis album is one of they defining moments in the melodic death genre. The three main bands that sprouted this type of music (Dark Tranquillity, In Flames, and At the Gates) all sounded completely different.\n\nAt the Gates had the thrashy sound. In Flames had the power metal sound. And Dark Tranquillity had the most unique sound. A mix of several sounds combining to have a most epic and grandeur sound.\n\nThe Gallery for that latter half of the last paragraph was born and dead with Dark Tranquillity. Even the band now has all but abandoned their old sound. The Gallery never got boring. It drew folk influence at times, it never recycled riffs a repeatedly throughout a song, and futures dynamic vocals. Get this; the bass was AUDIBLE, strange for a metal release. The drumming had blast beats and double bass, but maintained a more controlled pace. Everything about The Gallery was perfectly done.\n\nPunish My Heaven is the opener. This song alone would make you fall in love with this album; the opening riff feels so powerful. Not only that but the lyrics to the song feel like a medieval poem, a struggle between God and man. Heaven and Hell. The self and the universe. It's just empowering to say the least. The last two minutes are what sets cd's this apart. Most songs end in typical fashion, but Punish My Heaven ends with an epic closing two minutes that never get boring, no matter how many listens you take. No amount of words typed can justify the completeness and grandeur of this song.\n\nThe title track is another track much like the opening track. It has several passages that you wouldn\u2019t expect, and even has some female vocals that really assist in making this song one worth noting. Dark Tranquillity really set in this song to capture the atmosphere of The Gallery as a whole. Well-composed music, intricate song writing and the talent of the band helps this song really set you in the mood Dark Tranquillity intended. The bass lines stick with you and aren\u2019t always used for rhythm. The riffs constantly change to keep the dreaded monotony at a low. The guitars are crystal clear. The Gallery is a perfect example again of what melodeath used to be.\n\n... Of Melancholy is the closer track. A closing track should do just that. Bring closure to an album. This fails to live up to that. But don't think that's a bad thing. For it just lingers on long enough and ends in such an epic fashion it begs the listener wanting for more. Just like any great movie or book does. Dark Tranquillity has succeeded on doing this through music. The song structure of this album really makes it a great listen. Of Melancholy never follows any sort of systematic formula. It had continuity through good writing, and some mind-blowing melodies. Whether it\u2019s the leads, rhythm, bass, or drums carrying you through the song. Female vocals kick in a bit to help set the mood at one point. Just as you feel it may get to be a little repetitive. They kick off with the best closing 2 minutes to a cd. It has you pumping your fist in the air, humming the melody, and feeling every message the song is attempting to convey. Through all this they close it out with about five seconds of an acoustic melody that just really lets your mind take in the album you just listened to.\n\nIf you got the re-release you get some covers, of which I wasn\u2019t to thrilled about. Their Uriah Heap cover of \"Lady in Black\" wasn\u2019t too bad. Only because it reminds me of the Projector album which I highly approved of.\n\nOverall this cd is for the music fan that is looking for more than sheer brutality and gut wrenching speed. This is for the music fan than sit back and take in the atmosphere.\n",
        "\nIt's safe to say that \"Damage Done,\" the supposed big comeback album for one of Sweden's best bands, fell short... Just like the rest of melodic death metal albums that came out in 2002. It goes without saying that \"Damage Done\" was cluster-fucked in with every other big release of 2002: In Flames, Behemoth, Soilwork, etc. While it's not a total flop, and does have a damn good share of moments, Dark Tranquillity didn't really usher in anything outstanding on this album. \n\nFault #1 is the songwriting department. Compositions are pretty linear and don't offer much outside of the \"ear-candy\" factor on first listen. While songs like the opener, \"Final Resistance,\" offer up some solid neo-thrash verses and catchy-as-hell choruses, it's not anything to write home about in the end. By the time the band reaches the 2nd chorus of a song, you're ready to press the skip button. \n\nTo add on, there's not much complexity; don't expect any solos or technical flair, because that's a search you'll never complete. Anders' drums are a little TOO simplistic, and while the guitars definitely have a lot going for them, the uninspired structures bring everything down. \n\nFear not, though; we are, after all, talking about one of Sweden's better bands. Mikael Stanne's lyrics are the strongest point of this release, which I attribute most of the points to. His lyrics examine the human mind and emotions with a certain beauty that can't be described, (without being overly pretentious) and his vocal patterns are far from typical. On an actual level as vocalist though, this is not Mikael's strongest performance. Here, he uses a deeper pseudo-growl rather than his trademark rasp. Listeners are still able to decipher lyrics, and the gut-level punch adds to the album's more emotional moments; but his voice doesn't change tone much, and can become rather irritating through the course of the album. \n\nThe album's production is also another high point. Guitars and clear and crisp, while maintaining a healthy amount of low end; drums have a fresh and modern sound without resorting to triggers; and the electronic aspects come through beautifully on \"Cathode Ray Sunshine\" and \"Single Part of Two.\" \n\nWhile not the band's most memorable or technical offering, \"Damage Done\" is still fairly consistent; maybe a little TOO consistent. \n\nFavorite tracks: \"Final Resistance\", \"Single Part of Two\", \"Format C: For Cortex\", \"Cathode Ray Sunshine.\"\n",
        "\nAs a previous contributor noted the music and images in the main concert section of this live DVD are out of synch. To be more accurate, if you look closely, SOME of the images are out of synch. Hmmm.\n\nReading another contributor\u2019s comments about the annoyingly rapid shot edits made me think about the synch issue. I began to wonder if DT performed the show at least twice and spliced later shots from different angles into the \u201cmaster\u201d version. I conclude this because you\u2019ll see shots that are in synch cheek by jowl with shots that are hopelessly out of synch. In all honesty, if that is what the producers have done, they\u2019ve made a pretty good job of it. The (yes, annoying) rapid edits whip through most of the dodgy bits so you don\u2019t notice them all that much.\n\nI can only guess they\u2019ve done this to give the show some pace and energy. Let\u2019s face it, the audience is definitely not involved and poor Mikael Stanne is having a hard time whipping the Polish punters into anything remotely resembling a frenzy. If you\u2019ve seen DT live or flip to the bootleg sections of the DVD you\u2019ll see the band, and Stanne in particular, in their element. So the edits are there to give the main concert \u2013 shot in a TV studio for heaven\u2019s sake \u2013 a bit of kick.\n\nOnce all that is considered, you\u2019d have to admit that the music in the main concert is first-rate. Tight as a fist and very well recorded. To get a bit of real concert vibe the bootleg sections, also shot pretty well and with decent sound, make up for the lackluster atmosphere of the main show. Better than most of the stuff on YouTube, at any rate.\n\nAll in all then, it\u2019s not a bad package. If you love DT this is a terrific \u201cbest of\u201d collection and, as far as I know, the only DT DVD. As such it\u2019s definitely worth having, in my book.\n",
        "\nI've been a mild fan of the Gothenburg scene since my introduction with At The Gates. Once I began to understand the sound of Gothenburg, I started to search for other bands that were built upon the same structure as At The Gates. My search for more Gothenburg bands led me to Dark Tranquillity, a band who many praised as the best Gothenburg band. I became interested with Dark Tranquillity, and that's when I heard of the \"The Gallery.\" Many Dark Tranquillity fans called \"The Gallery\" the best album Dark Tranquillity has released, some predicted Dark Tranquillity would never top it, and some even went on to say it was the best Gothenburg album ever! I anxiously went to a CD store and bought \"The Gallery,\" and after a few listens, I was kinda disappointed. \"The Gallery\" is a good album, but it's nowhere near the masterpiece it is said to be.\n\nBefore the recording of \"The Gallery,\" former Dark Tranquillity vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n left the band for In Flames and guitarist Mikael Stanne was selected to perform vocals. After recording \"Of Chaos And Eternal Night,\" it was clear Stanne was ready to record his first full length album as a singer. Stanne's vocals could not fit the melodic madness of Dark Tranquillity any better. Stanne commonly uses a harsh, yet different kind of death growl. Instead of the incredibly low vocals used by most death metal bands, Stanne uses a clearer kind of growl that is easier to understand and seems a bit lighter. He also uses a clear voice on \"Punish My Heaven,\" which shows he can both sing and growl. His voice does get a bit annoying when he screams during the opening seconds of \"The Dividing Line,\" but his vocals usually seem to be a great asset of \"The Gallery.\"\n\nThe one thing that usually brings down a bunch of Gothenburg bands is the lack of variety in the music, and this is present on \"The Gallery.\" When speaking on a musical level, this album has \"Punish My Heaven,\" \"Silence And The Firmament Withdrew,\" \"Mine Is The Grandeur...\" \"...Of Melancholy Burning,\" the title track, and one song that sounds exactly identical to the rest of the album. The songs previously listed sound like something totally different then the rest of the album because of the riffs, vocals, and overall texture of the songs, but the rest of the album sounds like one melodic riff played for half an hour. The minimal variety in the music makes \"The Gallery\" get pretty old after a couple of listens.\n\nOne thing I really enjoy about \"The Gallery\" is the experimentation. The female vocals used on \"Punish My Heaven,\" \"...Of Melancholy Burning,\" and the title track help make these songs seem more interesting. The soft intro on the title track and \"Lethe\" help build up an emotional mood for the listener while \"Mine Is The Grandeur...\" is a swell instrumental orchestral breather that turns the album into a more progressive direction. There is little experimentation on \"The Gallery,\" but it still adds a powerful punch to the album.\n\nEven though \"The Gallery\" is a good album, it doesn't live up to all the hype it gets. I've grown more fond of the present day Dark Tranquillity rather then \"The Gallery.\" Even though I like this album, it has to be one of the overrated albums I've ever heard. Sure it's a good album, but a masterpiece? I think not.\n",
        "\nOn this release, Dark Tranquillity demonstrates that even the stuff they cut from the studio albums kicks supreme ass. Composed of unreleased tracks and their releases prior to \"Skydancer\", \"Exposures..\" succinctly spans the memorable career of the \"Gothenburg\" pioneers. Falling directly in line with their middle era, tracks one through seven offer thoughtfully composed melodic leads and riffs combined with a tendency towards electronically influenced choruses. I admit that the addition of their keyboardist was a good move, although a number of \"Gallery\" and \"Skydancer\" fans will disagree. Aside from the relatively shoddy \"Misery In Me\", the first part of this disc is all strong.\n\nAlmost like a primordial belch from the forgotten early 90's Swedish scene, the remaining five songs on disc one paint a clear picture of the band's early influences. \nWith a penchant for unnerving leads interspersed with forceful riffing and drumming, the \"A Moonclad Reflection\" tracks anticipate the hymnal odes to paganism and nature found on \"Skydancer\". Then, reverting even farther back to the sounds of Entombed and Carnage, the \"Trail of Life Decayed\" tracks are easily the darkest and heaviest material produced by the band (Septic Broiler material included). \n\nDisc 2, the audio taken from \"Live Damage\" is a nice bonus, but not exactly the selling point of this release. Any fans of DT or similar bands would do good to find this.\n",
        "\nI was surprised by Dark Tranquility's new album. I wasn't expecting much from them, however what I got the first time I listened to it satisfied me. This is by no means perfect and I have some complaints about it but other than that, it is above average melodic death.\n\nThe drums here are actually probably the best feature. They are fast, and they are heard well. The guitars aren't as great. There are many riffs, probably several per second at times, however they are all incomplete and very choppy which is a mistake many melodic death metal bands make. The vocals are also decent however 90% of the time it sounds like the vocalist has a touch too much saliva in his throat.\n\nThe first seven songs are what's really good on here. There are definately some memorable melodies and they make the choppy riffs less painful to listen to. \"The New Build\" has some great drumming to start the song. \"The Endless Feed\" starts off with some very good melodies and the \"wet\" vocals actually sound pretty good here. \"Lost to Apathy\" also has some very good melodies. However once we start getting beyond the seventh song which is \"One Thought\" the album starts losing my attention. It sounds very similar to all the songs before it, the drums start to get a bit repetitive and the riffs are choppier than earlier in the album. \"My Negation\" is rather long, 6:29, and boring because it starts off with a very quiet acoustic guitar. \"Dry Run\" also starts off with a rather quirky melody. \n\nOverall this is a very good album for the melodic death genre, however I have heard better, and while this does sound good, it does sound slightly generic. Recommended to melodic death fans, all others, stay away.\n",
        "\nMany people were dissapointed by the release of the Live Damage DVD. It's of poor quality, it has very messy synch work and the extras leave much to be desired. Hence, this was released. This was originally was supposed to be the CD version of that Krakow performance, but, they realized that much of their early EPs and bonus tracks were unavailable in some areas...\n\nThe first CD is full of gems. The album has the first two Dark Tranquillity EPs circa 91-92, with Anders Friden on vocals, as well as bonus tracks found in European and Asian versions of The Gallery, The Mind's I, Projector, Haven, and Damage Done. The first CD is very enjoyable, going from present to past in a backward progression through Dark Tranquillity's electronic Gothenburg, through their experimental stage, their melo-death Gothenburg sound, and back to their prog melo-death roots. It's an amazing retrospective, and many of these songs should have been included in their original albums.\n\nThe second CD is the Live Damage audio, and it's the only great part of the DVD, because it's a very good performance. Granted, Mikael Stanne sounds funny on Zodijackyl Light, but it's still great. All in all, this is a great release, and a must buy for DT fans.\n",
        "\nIf you are new to the melodic death scene, or just want to get an overall view on the works of Dark Tranquility, I would recomend picking up \"Exposures in Retrospect and Denial\". If someone asked me to show them what melodic death is about, this would be one of the CD's I would play, along with some At The Gates and a few other bands. The first CD consists of a bunch of unreleased tracks, as well as some songs that were only available on the japanese versions of the albums. After hearing it, I was left wondering why they would not release these tracks on the original albums, or for a larger audience. It is very enjoyable, and ranges from up-beat headbanging metal to slower tracks. I am generally not one to listen to slower metal, however I enjoy how dark tranquility puts it together. They can be a nice break every few songs.\nThe next CD is a live recording from when the band was touring in Poland. There are some classics here, Monochromatic Stains comes to mind, as well as many other good songs. They are the audio portion of the \"Live Damage\" DVD that was released a little while back. As I previously stated, if you want to check out this scene or band, then this is CD to pick up. Even long time Dark Tranquility fans would be wise to purchase it for the unreleased tracks. Well worth the money.\n",
        "\nWhy is this album so overlooked? I'd like to know that. I talk to many Dark Tranquillity fans and they don't mention this album that much. What is so wrong about this album? This is so vastly underrated it's not funny. It expands the formula they used on The Gallery to include more melodic parts, which is what they still use now. \n\nThe album jumps out with Dreamlore Degenerate, one of my absolute favorite DT tracks ever. It's too well made. Then, the one-two of Zodijackyl Light and Hedon hit you with some of the best DT material out there. The other standouts include the next track, Scythe Rage and Roses, as well as Insanity's Crescendo, Atom Heart, and the closer, The Mind's I. They are all very well made, each having a melody section that stands out. It's very catchy in it's own form.\n\nMikael Stanne's vocals are the best to me in this album. Everything is done right with his vocals. I'm not a huge fan of his clean vocals that are on Projector and Haven, so I think these vocals are perfect. The drumming is amazingly good, with Anders Jivarp also giving his best recorded performance in this album. My problem is the lack of Niklas Sundin's leads. Later material take advantage of his talents, but not this. Sad, because some of the songs could have used an embellishment. That's alright though. It's a damn good album still, and every DT fan should own it. The bonus tracks from the Suicidal Angels EP are good as well, with Archetype being my favorite, it's so quirky and fun.\n",
        "\nApparently there were no reviews for this DVD, and I just bought it (well, actually two months ago), so why not make an own review? \n\nI first discovered Dark Tranquillity when they released their Character album, and I enjoyed it. I got the other albums and listened to them a couple of times too but none of them was, in my opinion, as good as Character; the only one that could compete with Character was The Gallery and Projector. Sadly enough, they don't play any Character material (but that's pretty easy to understand because this DVD was released two years before Character) and not especially much of The Gallery material either (just one track: Punish My Heaven). I'm not saying that Dark Tranquillity's other albums sucks, because they rule... but not as much as Character, The Gallery and Projector. Ok, now to the DVD.\n\nThis it starts with a keyboard intro, and the Dark Tranquillity logo and a sign that says \"Staining Poland, Live in Krakow 2002\" rolling on the screen closely followed by the DVD cover panning over the screen from the left. It looked fine untill the Staining Poland sign appeared, which looked like something done in Paint in one minute. And it's the same thing when the DVD cover appears, it looks very unprofessional. Well, enough about the unprofessional video editing. The intro bursts into the track called \"The Wonders at Your Feet\" and Mikael Stanne, the second greatest metal vocalist (after Tomas Lindberg), jumps up on the stage and starts with the ordinary brutal scream, \"Alright!\". The performance and sound quality is great and Mikael Stanne looks happy as usual. But something strikes my already from the start, do they have to make those extremely fast clips between the band members? That's bad because of two things, 1. I wanna see how they play and how they make anything sound so perfect, and 2. It's pretty fucking annoying. And the worst thing in the whole song (maybe on the whole DVD), when Niklas Sundin does his solo, isn't you supposed to see him then? It seems as they show everyone but Niklas Sundin. That's the third annoying thing on this DVD, and the first track isn't finished yet?! \n\nThe next track is \"The Treason Wall\" which is in my opinion one of Dark Tranquillity's worst songs. Nothing special here, only Mikael's fantastic vocal performance. It still seems as the video editing guys don't get it, it isn't cool. I also notice the white flashing lights, for gods sake, please lay off the fucking lights. It looks really weird if you watch it on the TV or the computer because it looks like the lower part of the monitor/screen updates later than the upper part and it makes the whole movie to look \"laggy\". I don't think that I have to descibe every track one by one, so I just pick the best ones or the ones I feel that it's worth to comment. Two tracks after \"The Treason Wall\" is \"White Noise/Black Silence\" which is one of my favorite track of the Damage Done album. I actually think it sounds better live, so this one is really fantastic. After this great song comes Haven, the mediocre title track of the album with the same name (damn, that sounded stupid). Finally a The Gallery track! \"Punish My Heaven\" is a great track, but I would prefer Mine Is The Grandeur Of Melancholy Burning instead. I gotta say, this track really spanks ass live, but Mikael Stanne messes up one of the cooler parts of this track, the \"That's right! You'll suffer my punishment!\" part with some other style (or whatever you should call it) of saying it. When the Spanish-like sound that reminds me of tap dancing (even if I'm pretty sure it isn't) kicks in it's a shame it's set to a so low volume. \n\nThe next one is \"Monochromatic Stains\", the best track of the Damage Done, which sound better recorded in the studio even if it also sounds good live. Nothing special here. The following track is from Projector, yay! \"Undo Control\" starts as the usual with the string picking and then Mikaels calm singing, instead of the female vocals on the orginal. When the song really starts with the \"I resist without control\" part that sounds really heavy on the studio recording but live it sounds really lame. It gets better, the killer riff (when Mikael sings \"Claws that set in sleep\u00b4 December\"), but that doesn't save the track from being shitty live. I don't understand why they choosed to play this one live, it sounds much worse live than on the album, why didn't they pick \"Auctioned\" instead? It's 100 times better, and would be cool to see live. After this disappointment the great track \"Indifferent Suns\", my favorite from Haven, beggins. It sounds really good live, with those kick drum hits so perfectly fitted to the melody. It sounds as good as one the record, and probably the best track on this DVD. Only one bad thing about this, the camera man that shoots Anders Jivarp (the drummer), and filming like he was drunk or something. After this \"Format C: For Cortex\" follows, one of the better Damage Done tracks. It sounds great live, and Mr. Stanne sings (and growls) great as usual.\n\nNow my favorite track of all time, \"Lethe\" from The Gallery! The most disappointing things about this one, is that Mikael doesn't sing those \"despair-ish\" vocals (something like that) as good as on the record. I've seen a live video from '96 (or maybe '97), and on that one he sings those completely perfect. Well, it's still really good. The last kick ass track on this DVD is ThereIn, which is performed really good and Mikaels fantastic clean vocals sounds perfect live. \n\nAnother very annoying thing that I forgot to write about earlier is that the audio isn't synced with the video especially good.\n\nThis DVD also includes the \"Monochromatic Stains\" and \"ThereIn\" video together with some bootleg tracks recorded with a decent video camera, and it sounds really cool, more \"raw\". There's also some photos, pictures and desktop images included and a pretty interesting Interview with Mikael Stanne. In my opinion they could replace the photo gallery, the bootleg videos with some studio footage. It would be really cool to see how they work in the studio.\n\nJust a quick summary: Good performance, shitty editing. It was pretty hard to decide a rating for this one, but I think the performance compensates for the lousy editing.\nBest tracks: Lethe, ThereIn, Punish My Heaven, Indifferent Suns.\n",
        "\nThis DVD suffers. It wants to die. It begs for mercy. The only problem is that the music is good. Don't get me wrong at all. But just the way this show turned out was amazingly fucked. \n\nThe concert's got a great setlist, covering everything that DT has done for the exception of their collection of early EPs and Skydancer. The actual performance of the songs is great and spot on. So what's the problem? I'll give you two.\n\n1) The crowd ain't into it. I don't know how many people were there, but after every song, it seems only 5 people cheer at a time. What the hell? It looks to be a closed set type deal, which really hurts the crowd interaction. And if you've been at a Dark Tranquillity gig, you know that Stanne likes to interact with the crowd. Case point, when the bridge section to Hedon comes on, and Stanne is doing the \"Hedon...Hedon...Hedon...Hedon\" part, he lets the crowd sing half of the Hedon chant...well there's no chant. Barely any clapping. There's no life.\n\n2) This is the bigger problem. The video images and the audio are not synched correctly. Therefore, the song is playing, but the images are at least 3 notes behind, and at first, for the first part of the show, you can't really tell, but once it gets to around 'Lethe', you begin to notice it a whole lot more, especially with Stanne's vocals and Anders Jivarp's drums. It's horrible. And afterward, you'll LOOK for it yourself, and you'll notice that Niklas, Martin and Peter are all off as well! It's really no fun.\n\nThe extras are pretty decent, with a whole bunch of bootleg songs, and my only complaint is that they put boots of the same songs already on the DVD. Couldn't you guys at least put some other songs? The interview was crap though. It was so cut and pasted it wasn't funny, and the interviewer was not very fluent in speaking English, so his questions were a bit hard to understand.\n\nNow onto the gig itself (the sound at least). The first few songs sound great. Wonders at Your Feet, Treason Wall, and Hedon (for the exception of the chorus Hedon part) sound great. It flows pretty well until you hit Punish My Heaven, to which you end up alternating between a slow and a fast song, and it gets pretty sluggish. This goes on up to Lethe, where you hit this cog of songs that are pretty slow, and depending on how much you like their slower, clean vocal stuff, you'll have a different reaction. Although I don't mind those songs, I think the setlist could have been a bit better put together. The final two songs do rev up the spirit of this show, but it's a bit too late don't ya think guys? \n\nIf you are a hardcore DT fan like me, this is a decent buy, but for \"normies\", nah, you might want to save your money unless you find it used for cheap.\n",
        "\nI never thought Dark Tranquillity\u2019s newest opus, \u201cCharacter\u201d, could be so impressive. After watching bands like In Flames and Soilwork fall into the commercial world of almost Nu Metal, I was afraid that the forefathers of the Gothenburg Sound were going in the same direction. Apparently I was wrong. Very wrong. Everything is better than before on this album, it\u2019s like a second \u201cThe Gallery\u201d. From start to end the sound is heavy, melodic and flawless.\n\n\u201cThe New Build\u201d which I can describe as \u201cone damn good opener\u201d, is presenting the new sound of Dark Tranquillity. First, the guitars are playing heavier and more technical riffs than ever before. The bass keeps the pace in an unbelievable effort to add deepness to the overall sound. You can tell that Anders Jivarp has been improving his drumming for this album or he\u2019s simply showing the world the full extent of his talent. Finally, the keyboards have definitely caught my attention. Unlike most (if not all) bands of death metal these days, they use the synth as an instrument not just an atmosphere-maker. That is simply bringing more variety and complexity to Character\u2019s refined sound.\n\nThe third track \u201cOut of Nothing\u201d is mesmerising; a deep and catchy bass intro followed by a groovy yet heavy riff. The keyboard is making a great transition between the verses and chorus and a fast and technical solo accentuates the song\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThen after the slow-paced and very dark \u201cThe Endless Feed\u201d and the single release \u201cLost To Apathy\u201d comes \u201cMind Matters\u201d. This song carries the essence of \u201cCharacter\u201d, heavy, deep and fast-paced riffs, technical and stable drums, a deep and intense bass, a rich and developed keyboard presence, all that completed by Mikael Stanne\u2019s vocals. His, voice already my favourite around the Death Metal scene, has just improved on the album. Stanne seems to use a more brutal growl just like he used to in the \u201cThe Gallery\u201d and \u201cThe Mind\u2019s I\u201d days. It simply makes the whole thing even better. Moving onwards, the last song I will talk to you about is \u201cSenses Tied\u201d the tenth track. Once again this song is fast and truly impressive. This song is probably Stanne\u2019s best performance of the album; he sings fast and articulates so damn well that you don\u2019t even need the booklet to read the lyrics. What also struck me was how the keyboard was almost playing the role of a guitar on the whole piece. It practically leads the intro riff and it\u2019s definitely leading the chorus. That\u2019s something you don\u2019t see every day. Yeah, it has been done a few times before, but never was it sounding so good without changing the true metal sound of the song.\n\n\u201cCharacter\u201d is definitely on the list of the possible Best Metal Album of the Year. It\u2019s a proof that Dark Tranquillity is not planning to stop breaking the barriers of metal. Since their beginning they have constantly changed style, exploring the musical world in a way few ever did. This new album is a flawless masterpiece and just like all previous DT albums, way ahead of its time. It\u2019s defining new standards for Melodic Death Metal.\n",
        "\nThe Gallery is, without any doubt, the best Dark Tranquillity album, and a true classic of the so called Gothenburg Melodic Death Metal. It was released by the time this gender was still developing, when In Flames wasn't still the band that all other Gothenburgers wanted to be. \n\nDark Tranquillity were threading new ground here, joining classic metal riffage with beautiful harmonic and neo-classical inspired solos, and an amazing vocal performance by Mikael Stanne, who is IMO the best singer within this genre to ever exist - instead of the whinning \"trying-to-be-black-metal\" of And\u00e9rs Friden and all his clones, Mikael uses a darker, yet cleaner sound, even alternating with clean vocals in some parts (like in Punish My Heaven). The guitars have a neo-classical feeling, and are amazingly harmonious, with an excellent interplay between the two. None of the guitarists tries to do anything too ambitious or beyond his capacities, preventing the album from reaching an ultimate wankfest. The acoustic guitar parts also give an amazing atmosphere that just improves an already amazing album. The drums are very well executed and technically almost perfect, sometimes leading the music instead of just serving as a rythm. Even the bassist has an opportunity to shine here: the synthetised bass rythms give that finishing touch to the guitar interplay. \n\nSo, there is nothing missing on this album: everything from top to bottom is perfect, and the only flaw I can think of is Stanne's lack of vocal variation: no matter how good his growls are, he sometimes can get a little annoying. Also, that female vocal part on The Gallery could have been a little well more interpreted. But that won't prevent from apreciating the amazing display of songwriting and playing talent that DT show here.\n\nBest tracks: Punish My Heaven, Edenspring, The Gallery, The One Brooding Warning, Lethe... all of them are great.\n",
        "\nIf Dark tranquillity have an album in their regular discography that has been overlooked, it's for sure 'The mind's I', which had to carry on the difficult task of being the heir to the 1995 classic 'The gallery' and set the ground for the groundbreaking 1998 release 'Projector'. In addition to being between such two relevant works in the career of the band, the very fact that Dark tranquillity decided to go for a much darker sound just makes this album more of a rare bug.\n\nMake no mistake, 'The mind's I' is undoubtedly a Dark tranquillity album, sporting the same level of technical finesse of the rest of their works, both in lyrics and music, and all of it finished with an exceptional execution. 'The mind's I' is still in the pre-electronica age of the band, which means that we don't have keyboards, and instead there are acoustic guitars and female voices at some points. I particularly don't prefer one age over the other, but some may like more the old sound of the band. The general sound goes into a much darker tone than 'The gallery', leaving the almost-pseudo-jazzy guitar work of most themes that album, and going into heavily distorted guitar sound accompanied by Mikael Stanne's magnificent as ever voice. The band still preserves its melodic tendence, but it's definitely a much darker album than the previous two.\n\nIn terms of lyrics, 'The mind's I' still has lyrics written by both Sundin and Stanne, and Sundin's writing is recognizable in themes like 'Hedon' or 'Tongues', that feature his characteristical bizarre and surrealist poetry. Stanne writes more or less in that fashion too, and it's nice because his lyrics are much more complex than seen in Projector, for example. The lyrics to this album are definitely magnificent and really give it a second dimension rather than just the sound, what has always been a very good thing about Dark tranquillity's work.\n\n'The mind's I', in its original version (not the new re-release) includes 12 tracks, all of them in the level Dark tranquillity has its fans accustomed to. The best tracks in my opinion are 'Dreamlore degenerate' (a very good opening theme), 'Hedon' (long-winded and semi-progressive theme with Sundin lyrics and a vocal contribution by Anders Frid\u00e9n), 'Scythe, rage and roses' (a short and rather brutal trash/death headbanger with a drum-killer of an ending), 'Insanity's crescendo' (long and magnificent theme with lots of acoustic guitar and female vocals by Sara Svensson) and 'Tongues' (very good ending theme with some spine-tickling moments). The rest of tracks are very good by themselves, but wind up as a bit boring in the context of the whole album.\n\nAll in all, 'The mind's I' is a rather different approach on melodic death metal with some new musical features, magnificent songwriting, and the exceptional execution provided by these Swedes. It'll be an interesting album for those who want to see Dark tranquillity at full power without resorting to their last electronic headcrusher, 'Character', and it's definitely one of the albums they can exploit for concerts, since most of its songs are real headbangers. On the dark side of things, it also gets boring at times. Oh, and the prints in the booklet are almost unreadable (wonderful booklet design otherwise).\n",
        "\nWith each step that this band takes, they confirm why they are one of the most important bands in the metal scene. It\u2019s sad to say it, but as one of the creators of the Gothenburg Sound, maybe DT is the only left flame holders of this trend. Sincerely I liked more Damage Done, but I must recognize Character is a great album, because DT returns to some of their death metal roots in the way of The Mind\u2019s I era, but they still continue experimenting with the electronic part (I say \u201cthank you\u201d to Martin B.). Character is not as melodic as Damage Done, but it doesn\u2019t have the \u201cindustrial sound\u201d performed on Haven. I just can say that they found the perfect tuning for the keyboards and now they are a vital part of the DT organism.\n\nCharacter kicks off with The New Build, reminding us that Dark Tranquillity is one of the heaviest acts nowadays. It\u2019s just the perfect opener for the album, just as Final Resistance did on Damage Done. With Through Smudged Lenses heaviness continues; it seems that these guys don\u2019t want to give us a rest for while until this track ends with a slow and dark outro. DT retakes the curse with Out of Nothing, which has nice piano parts and one of the most memorable guitar solos on this album. Lost to Apathy gives you a general idea of the main sound of DT. If you liked Monochromatic Stains performed on Damage Done you must like this song. And from this point I would say that the following songs define the trend of the whole Character album: highlights like Mind Matters, One Thought, and Senses Tied are part of the heaviest side of this band, but I must give a special mention to Am I 1?, which has a nice main riff, with kind of Projector and The Gallery stuff mixed with the new sound acquired in the last two albums; and of course, the closing track My Negation, perfect to end the album: acoustic intro but more heavy later, maybe it will remind you of Mine is the Grandeur\u2026 Of Melancholy Burning (the 2 closing tracks from The Gallery album).\n\nCharacter is one of the strongest albums from Dark Tranquillity, maybe not the best but as always with this band, another face they have recently unveiled and that\u2019s one more reason to hail them and to pay attention to their past and future works.\n",
        "\nAfter the completely experimental \"Projector\", Dark Tranquillity decided to go metallic again, at least somewhat. The vocals are all growled this time but keyboards are still used pretty much everywhere.\n\nThe songs on here are all focused on being catchy and straight-forward more than anything else. It works in the beginning as the best tracks are in the beginning. Opener \"The Wonders At Your Feet\" is nice by Gothenburg standards and \"Not Built To Last\" ain't really bad either. However, after these tracks that already were sort of blend, we just get an even higher dose of it. \"Indifferent Suns\" is keyboard driven as fuck and quite slow, while the vocal patterns are undeniably quite nice. \n\nAfter this the quality drops frequently. \"Feast of Burden\" could have might as well have been called \"Feast of Genericness\" and the title track lacks in getting anything going. The second half of it is more of the same shit. A bunch of keyboards and pedestrian wanking, \"Fabric\" being the only worthwhile track.\n\nWhat makes \"Haven\" a definite loser of an album is that it is so god damn Gothenburg, in every negative sense of the word. I can only take this kind of pedestrian-ness and keyboards in low doses. Something cool is rarely going on guitar-wise and it all relies on vocals and keyboards. It turns into something best defined as \"elevator metal\". \n\nYes, it's that casual. Sure, it's nicely produced and slick. That's what kills it, dammit. After listening to it I just need something raw and aggressive that doesn't plod in mid-tempo for 45 mins.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquility has done it once again. This is a band that just never ceases to amaze their listeners release after release, constantly re-shaping and re-inventing their style yet remaining distinguishable in every way. Character is perhaps the band's best work to date and serves as a testament for all bands labeled under the \"Gothenburg sound\". Although the band doesn't like that label which many place them in, they truly blow practically every other band out of the water today when it comes to melodic death metal. Imagine the melodic aggressiveness of The Gallery combined with the luscious atmospheres of Projector and Haven, and you may have an idea of what Character is like. However, I doubt anybody will be completely prepared for what DT has in store this time around regardless of previous listening experience. With every consecutive release, Dark Tranquility always come up with something unique from anything else they've done before and this album is definately no exception. \n\nThe first track \"The New Build\" immediately kills you from start to finish, leaving no mercy for your soul. Perhaps one of the most catchy and aggressive songs the band has ever made with everything being top notch. By listening to the first song, you already know that this is going to be one hell of an album, track after track. Stanne's vocals are better than ever, growling and screaming his lungs out in a much more matured way than his days on Lunar Strain with In Flames. The guitars create bone-crushing melodies and incrediblely aggressive riffs combined with the fantastic drumming of Anders Jivarp. This is the way melodic death metal was meant to be performed. Rather than taking the nu-metalish mainstream route former Gothenburg bands have chosen (In Flames, Soilwork) , Dark Tranquility continue to tread their own path, innovating their sound constantly, staying true to old fans while gaining many new ones with a sound that is catchy yet still complex as it was when melodic death metal was at its prime in the early 90's. While other bands think otherwise, DT care only about the music, not cash. They deserve every penny they get for their passion to create such brilliant music. \n\nIf you are a fan of Dark Tranquility, then Character will definately please you. Even if you haven't heard any of the band's stuff you'll most likely become addicted to this release. This is one of their best albums and it is amazing that they are still just as strong as ever since '89. Character is incredibly aggressive, catchy, and melodic. It's not mainstream metal by any means yet still deserves much acclaim just for being such damn good music. This, in my opinion, is a big step up from Damage Done, which I thought was a great album alone. Although it is very early 2005, I can definately see this topping my list as one of the best albums of the year already. Character is more addictive than crack and will be constantly spinning in my stereo for a long long time. Long live Dark Tranquility. They must come to the states soon. I must see them live.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity's newest release Character is a huge surprise from a band that has been fairly \"hit and miss\" throughout their 13-year career. It is nothing new to suggest the Gothenburg melodic death scene has died an ugly death. However, with this album, Dark Tranquillity have proven to outlive the scene. Character is certainly a stronger album overall than past efforts, and while it has its great moments, it also revisits why some of the other albums don't stand out as excellent. \n\nThe opening track The New Build is a mover. It just keeps going with riff after riff, never once getting boring. Even the half time sections keep you moving. The first weak point of the album comes with The Endless Feed. Although some of the effects in this track are well placed and interesting, we get a sense of that mallcore whispered vocal during a soft synth section with no guitars. The album quickly returns to form with Lost to Apathy. This is arguably the most memorable song I have heard from these guys featuring very well constructed melodic guitar passages and very tasteful keyboards. Again, for some reason, at 4:00 we have the return of the hushed whipsers. At least they were at the end of the song and not a long middle section. \n\nMind Matters is a song that starts off kicking your ass, but then takes a unnecessary turn at 2:00, slows down for no reason, and the picks up again. The following track, One Thought is example of how to use keyboards in a metal band. In the past, a song such as this would have likely gone down the tubes for Dark Tranquillity, but the song structure works very well here. The slower sections have a purpose and don't leave you going \"what the fuck?\" Dry Run is just more of the same with a serving of more whispered vocals. Again, why do they keep doing this? It's not scary. Am I 1? offers a change of pace with more interesting varied parts that involve heavy keyboard work and tempo changes, and makes for one of the more interesting songs. \n\nThe album's closer, My Negation, is slow and seems to take forever. It has great potential and the music touches on some interesting melodies, but they never go anywhere. This song should have been placed in the middle because an album with very little significant down time should not closed with such a droner. The keyboard outro is probably the best part of the song. \n\nThe album is fairly strong and a good representation of the melodic death metal genre. The qualities are the overall heaviness and greatly improved song structures. The album loses points for repeating itself in several places and those horrid whispered vocals. It's a very accessible album, and would make a better commercial album than any of the current radio friendly nu-metal bands. \n\nBest tracks: The New Build, Out of Nothing, Lost To Apathy, One Thought\n",
        "\nI wasn't expecting that much from this album actually, but man when I heard it for the first time I was in complete shock. With all of the Gothenburg bands \"selling out\" and totally overhauling their styles, I just expected DT to follow suit and write shorter, catchier less intelligent material. I felt Damage Done was a solid CD, but lackluster for such a talented band such as DT, no where near their older stuff in terms of technicality, depth and intelligence, but this disc gave me a new found respect for this band.\n\nThe one word I would use to sum up this album is aggresive. DT is known for mostly very intelectual song structure and really involved lyrics and complicated music, but this CD just kicks you in the ass and never lets up, but still remains technical and impressive as fuck. Only a few breaking moments are reserved for clean interludes or a break from the non-stop thrashing. I absolutely love the approach they took for this new album, it just completely surprised me and blew me away. The songs on this album are by far some of the best the band has ever written, which is incredible that they can continue to remain true to their original style and still evolve as a band and write great music.\n\nI was really impressed that the band didn't sacrifice any of the things that made them one of the orignal and best Gothenburg bands. I would compare them to Iron Maiden in the sense that they have never sold out and wrote a song to get airplay or to gain fans, their music has for the most part remained extremely consistent and yet still refreshing and enjoyable. They're writing music that they love and that passion really shows on this disc. My favorite tracks are probably Mind Matters and Am I 1? (despite the lackluster song title, the actual song owns). I love the use of the keyboards in here as well, which have always been very well done, not overdone like some bands. When the keys are used they make for a refreshing break and usually a pretty badass hook that you won't get out of your head for a long while.\n\nOverall if you're a DT fan, you're going to absolutely love this, and even if you aren't I would recommend giving it a listen. The band may actually gain some new fans just because of the sheer tempo and speed that they keep up for the whole CD, but old school DT fans will not feel neglected at all. This CD is fucking brilliant, when it officially debuts in January 2005, it will automatically be one of the contenders for best metal CD of the year.\n",
        "\nRarely am I impressed. Even more rarely am I impressed to such an extent as this. Dark Tranquillity has been nothing but consistently good, if not utterly great, for over a decade of album making. In this very admirable and accomplished attempt, Dark Tranquillity manages to change up their sound, without losing the distinction of their sound. It's a tad bit more on the tenebrous side, more punchy and more atmospheric than previous releases. What they've done here, is created a new sound, while still remaining grounded.\n\nMikael Stanne still remains one of my favorite vocalists, and he's still doing what made him good in the past ... he's not traveling the road of his peers, Soilwork or In Flames, thank goodness ... the drummer has done some practicing - and it never hurts ... he's become more precise, and his parts accent the music perfectly. Even though this CD starts out with a blast beat, the main complaint I have on the drummers part, is he just needs to do a few more 4th note, and 8th note beats ... but, no damage done. (hehe ... *cough*)\n\nScattered throughout are riffs reminisent of Gothenburg's glory days ... melodic yet punch-you-in-the-face heavy, great riffage. The keyboards add a superb touch of atmosphere where it's called for, and compliment the guitars very well.\n\nThere is little going on in Gothenburg that people pay much attention to anymore, but Dark Tranquillity is proving to me, to be something that will stand the test of time. They completly outshine their peers, and continue to travel new territory.\n\nOver all, I have no real complaints about the CD. Mikael's performance is dead on, and as far as I can see, Martin (keys) and Anders (drums) have stepped it up a notch. I'm very, very impressed with this album ... I don't just recommend it - I DEMAND YOU GET IT!\n",
        "\nAfter a long abscence from my playlist I decided to once again listen to this album and give it a review. \"Projector\" used to be one of my absolute favourites before I got sick of easy listening metal. However, despite my hate for Gothenburg-sounding bands this CD still leaves me impressed. Of all the albums labeled experimental, this is clearly the best of the bunch. \n\nNow, one would instantly think that the pussy side of a melodic band like this would be terrible at best. But the things is that the more they depart from playing metal, the more they excel. Many times this comes of as sounding like a depressive hard rock version of Depeche Mode. And hell, I like it.\n\nA big reason for this is that Mikael Stanne is a clean vocalist of high class. He puts much sincere emotion into the deep vocals. To this day I've never understood why he just doesn't go for it full time since his growling is mid-class at best. Especially live.\n\nWhere this albums successor, \"Haven\", has very little appeal beyond catchiness, this has depth. And the more they depart from growling and riffing, the better it gets. The knockout combo (or should I say regression combo?) of \"Undo Control\" and \"Auctioned\" is definitely the best couple of songs this band ever wrote.\n\nTracks three, four, five, seven, eight and ten has that great feeling going, while \"Freecard\", \"There In\" and \"Dobermann\" are on the mediocre side of things. \"The Sun Fired Blanks\" is the most classic sounding track on this album, and actually pretty good. It's pretty punchy and a fine party metal song.\n\nDark Tranquillity could probably sucker me in as an all time fan if this would be their sound. I can't say their metal music gives me much. Some of the music here is undeniably superior to everything else they've done.\n",
        "\nAs a taster for the forthcoming album, this four-track mini works Ok. Not so much because the standard of the songs here are revoltingly high, more for the fact that leave you wanting more.The disc starts off with one brand new original track, \"Lost to Apathy\" itself, that is quite good.It song that bears great resemblance to the ones found on \"Damage Done\", a medium paced riffer with slighty darker vocals than usual from Mikael Stanne. Gets better as it progresses, with a nice finale. \n\nSecond track \"Derivation TNB\" is noted in the inlay as a song \"featuring severely altered bits& pieces from various songs from the upcoming album\". This may seem bad, but it holds together rather well, a mellow, slow piece with whispered vocals. \n\n\"The Endless Feed\" is a remix of an original track that will appear on the new album, and you can sense that the album version will probably be better,here\u00b4s a bit too much electronics for my tastes, but the song contains some weighty riffage that makes it acceptable. \n\nFinally, we have a live version of \"Undo Control\". There must be at least 30 songs in their repertoire that would be more suitable for a live performance, I\u00b4d rather listen to the album version of this song any day of the week. \n\nIt\u00b4s enough to keep me occupied until the album hits the stores, anyway.\n",
        "\nWhen I first bought this album I didn\u2019t quite get it. It was so far removed from their previous efforts, so complex and twisted at first listen, that I didn\u2019t know what to think. One of my friends said it sucked big time. Today he worships this album, and so do I. It\u2019s one of the most fascinating pieces of metal art I\u2019ve ever laid my hands on, even though it took me a few listens to fully grasp how good the album really was.\n\nThe changes made from previous records are partly in their song structure, with more open arrangements, more space in the songs, a slight change of pace and overall shorter songs. The most recognizable change however, is in Mikael Stanne\u00b4s singing. Here he performs growling as well as a lot of very expressive clean vocals, a very pleasant surprise indeed. Hell, on the two tracks \u201cDay to End\u201d and \u201cAuctioned\u201d he sings clean vocals throughout, and with great result. On the other songs there is more of a mixture of the vocal styles, and it sounds magnificent all the way.\n\nA permanent keyboardist has also been employed, and he does his job well all through the album without taking too much place. The guitars complement each other nicely, and have become more and more riff-oriented for each album, without losing the special DT melodic type of playing. They particularly excel in some solo parts on \u201cThe Sun Fired Blanks\u201d and \u201cTo a Bitter Halt\u201d where they really get going.\n\nAs the album progresses, it just keeps growing on you. Once you have reached final track \u201cOn your time\u201d and it mesmerizes you with its sheer tempo and fury, you are well and truly on your knees, worshipping at the altar of \u201cProjector\u201d. Every single song on offer here is so magnificently crafted and powerful in its own right that it makes your heart pound faster, but they also make each other and thus the album stronger by complementing each other in such a fantastic way. A true masterpiece for all ages.\n",
        "\nHaven is often a very overlooked album by a generally underrated band. In a genre where In Flames and Soilwork seem to gain the most general acceptance, its bands like Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates and Sentenced(arguably) that put this genre on the map and wrote consistent kick ass melodic death. Haven has been labelled a return to their heavy sound. Which while true is also incorrect. Much heavier than their experimental gem Projector, with the vast majority being distorted growls although not quite as heavy as The Gallery era. Still enough softer more atmospheric influences to be considered a true return. But outstanding nonetheless. The guitar riffage is excellent as always on this album whenever present but what differentiates this album is the heavy use of keyboards mixed with the aggressive stylings of Dark Tranquillity. \n\nThere is a fair share of complex guitarwork here but most of it just fast pace and the guitar melodies cannot stand with The Gallery but they are outstanding nonetheless. Not much to say about the drum and bass section as usual. Creates a unique sound which really beats Soilwork's attempts with keyboards in my honest opinion. To top it all off Dark Tranquillity managed to incorporate dare I say catchy choruses with deep growls. I could list each song in its greatness but most revolve around fast paced/epic riffs, memorable guitar melodies(many dual guitar parts) and gorgeous keyboards and Stanne's usual growls giving this album a unique touch for Dark Tranquillity. This is more of a personal favorite for me. Most people seem to think The Gallery and Damage Done are better for an introduction to this band. Well, if the description is more to your fancy than traditional melo death maiden worshipped guitar harmonies and harsh growls without the atmospheric presence stick with the other recommendations. It is very hard to go wrong with Dark Tranquillity.\n\nFavorites: The Wonders At Your Feet, Feast of Burden, Fabric\n",
        "\nI'm going to give Dark Tranquillity a little credit here. While I cannot say I really enjoy this release or anything, it does not pain me to listen to, and it was enjoyable for a listen the first few times. \n\nMany of the songs on this album do not sound very different from one another, they all use a similar riff type which is fast and of a more simple nature, the drumming also doesn't really standout, it, along with the bass just follow the guitar. Even though none of them standout, it does give it a complete sound which is nice. \n\nThe vocals never really change much, on all the songs Mikael Stanne uses the same type of growl, it does make sense that he would do this, seeing as it is the typical vocal type of melo-death, but some clean vocals or maybe some different type of growls or even some screeches could have at least given a little more depth to the songs. \n\nI can say that this cd should at least get a listen from people, especially if you have never heard melo-death before. This could serve has a fine example of what melo-death is all about, fast guitars, bass and drums and growling, there are more parts to melo-death, those are just the more common things. \nIf the songs were a little more different from eachother, this would be a better cd all around, but as it stands, it is just average.\n",
        "\nDark Tranquillity\u2019s fourth studio album is, in my opinion, their best. Projector is their most melodic album yet released. I just love Mikael\u2019s vocals; he can sing with a clear voice and do some nice growls, so it really leaves to the atmosphere of the album something great. \nProjector starts off with Freecard. It starts off with a nice piano introduction and then goes on to the heavy guitar riffs, and returns in the end to conclude with the same piano as in the beginning. Freecard was a great song to begin the album, but then it just gets better. Therein, easily the best track of the entire album is absolutely wonderful. It starts off with a nice and heavy guitar riffs, then Mikael comes in with his beautiful deep voice and changes from growling vocals to clear vocals a few times. The main riff of that song is very catchy; it is what made me like this song and what made me want to get further into Dark Tranquillity.\n\nUndo Control is also an excellent song on the album. The intro riff is also amazing in this song, it really gets you into the song. Then the female vocals get in and leave the song with, not a thoroughly dark atmosphere, but definitely an atmosphere. It practically follows the same pattern as Therein. Then, my favourite slow song of the album: Auctioned. There are absolutely no growls on that song, Mikael\u2019s voice remains clear from beginning to end. He sings it with a kind of complaining voice, which renders the lyrics more credible and plunges you into the song. Four minutes into the song is where it gets even better. You can clearly hear the nice job Michael Nicklasson does on the bass, and then the excellent slow dusky solo.\nThe streak of excellent songs does not end there; To A Bitter Halt is another nice heavy song. The vocals never get soft and same goes for the guitar, it is always heavy and the guitarist throws in a nice solo halfway through the song. The Sun Fired Blanks just did not do it for me. I never was able to get into that song, in my opinion; it is the weakest of the album. Good, but nothing exceptional. The next song, Nether Novas, is one of the most solid tracks of the album. The dark, deep, powerful and ingenious lyrics of this song are definitely one of a kind. The best part of the song is when there is the slow guitar riff (I wouldn\u2019t call it a solo), it is so catchy, I heard the song once, and a week later, I was singing that small guitar riff, but could not remember where I heard it.\n\nThe next track, Day To End, is the softest song of the album along with Auctioned. It is not excellent, but still is a good song. Mikael keeps a clear voice, and the guitars don\u2019t get heavy at all. Dobermann and On Your Time are both good songs too. Using the clean and \u201cgrowly\u201d vocals, these are nice songs to end Projector.\n\nOverall, the album is excellent. Practically all songs have an incredibly catchy introduction riff and most of them contain a gloomy and slow solo, nothing incredible, but they really grow on you. So the stand-out tracks on the album are: FreeCard, ThereIn, UnDo Control, Auctioned, and Nether Novas. People who love melodic death metal should definitely buy this album; I give it 93/100.\n\nDarkDryad\n",
        "\nLots of keyboard, a well distorted aggressive guitar, scorching rhythm \u2013 so begins the first song \u201cthe wonders at your feet\u201d. Death harsh vocals follow. All that in some unexplainable way woven with lyrical, soul moving motives, such \u201clyrical pauses\u201d as if the rough riffs were especially made to lay bare your soul and then slow down to touch it with the bitter balm of regret, sorrow or love\u2026\u2026\u2026and then Strike again!\n\nThis way the other songs go as well, an exceptional melodic diversity (Melodic Death was called so not in vain) doesn`t leave you indifferent. By the way, \u201cIndifferent suns\u201d is a fine song about the impuissance of mankind to face Disaster(? Apocalypse of in general?).\nBeing honest I won`t hide that I never totally understood the sense of this albums songs \u2013 the texts are so altisonant and unclear that there`s either a deepest sense uncomprehensible for mortal minds OR just a compilation of high-sounding words (anyway citing from these lyrics will make you sound Spinosa or else - a fool).\n\nIt is difficult to point out ONE song from the album \u2013 they all are at a very high level, there are some very remembering guitar and keyboard passages in \u201cFeast of burden\u201d, \u201cNever built to last\u201d etc,really, the great riffs, an small moments are so numerous you simply can`t figure out single ones \u2013 the songs are literally tissued of them. \n\nThe title song \u201cHaven\u201d has a very prominent beginning, unfortunally those \u201clyrical\u201d slow passages are spoiled with a muted whispering lamenting voice, which produced a very unpleasant effect. The crap repeats in \u201cEmptier still\u201d \u2013 maybe the worst song because of that (you may have a great desire to push the skip button before the well-wrought part begins)\n\nThus, we have a 1st class album here, the interlacing and combination of guitars and keyboard, of aggressive and lyrical passages, of different, not to say opposite, emotions will wonder-stike, astonish, emmarvel. Just don`t be afraid of being invaded by feelings, and you won`t have the desire to search for the defects of the album\u2026.Just Enjoy it\u2026\u2026.\n",
        "\nCrazy to see the mix of reviews on this one but I guess it comes down to whether you're a purist of the genre or an every-once-in-a-while listener. I, for one, fit the latter. \n\nI find Haven to be the most accessible album of the whole Swede Growl sound. It is an ideal blend of semi-coherent mutterings and melodic, black metal. I can see how die-hard fans of this genre might label it too wimpy but if you're a listener of more mainstream metal then you'll find this album to be the perfect entree into the world of melodic death metal.\n\nThe music is pure metal symphony but not to the point of Therion or Symphony X. This is mostly attributed to the different guitar layerings and the generous, but not overdone, keyboards. The guitars frequently change up from speedy chugging to hard power chords to tranquil strumming and are always perfectly cranked up or toned down in unison with the rest of the instrumentation. Given all this, I think what really makes me rave about Haven more than other melodic death offerings are the vocals of Stanne. Unlike other bands and some other DT albums, he doesn\u2019t abandon the requisite growls of the genre but somehow manages to make them melodic to the point where they\u2019re (dare I say?) singing-like without really being singing. I think it\u2019s tough to compare and that\u2019s what makes Haven an exceptional album.\n\nAs for the songs, there\u2019s not a dud in the bunch. Every track is worthy of being a top track on many other albums. Of the lot, \u201cFabric\u201d has become my favorite here. The anthemic SUCK IT IN... TAKE IT DOWN (wow, that don't look right) wakes a person up from their matrix-laden coma. \u201cThe Wonders at Your Feet\u201d opens the album at a strong gallop and sets the stage for what\u2019s to follow. The tempo and guitar change-ups don\u2019t take long to come and are in full-force with the 2nd track \u201cBuilt to Last\u201d. From there the album continues to outdo itself right through to the end. \u201cEmptier Still\u201d is the one track containing a non-growling vocal which I would normally find a relief when listening to a full At The Gates album for example. Not so with Haven, it defies my standard reaction to the genre.\n\nI will admit that there\u2019s not a ton of variety on the album but who needs sapphires and emeralds when you\u2019ve got a bag full of diamonds? Other DT albums I own: The Gallery, The Minds I, Projector and Damage Done. They all have their own merits but Haven is the one that consistently delivers.\n",
        "\nThis album awakes contradictory feelings over me: For one side, I find all the songs following the same 4 x 4 rythm, all along, since the very first note to the ending one (even when it is a hidden variation of it or it seems to relax at times, just keep on counting steps on your head, and it never changes. The album can be used as a clock). But for the other side, they do wonderful things only using that structure (and also, to be sincere, most metal bands use also only that rythm). So my question is, should a band be required to variate what they do, when they do it perfectly? \n\nAnd two answers come from my heart. The first one, \"I would like to see some pace changes here and there\", and the second one \"I could keep on listening to this for hours\". Being both of them true, I guess I can bear them even if Jivarp never goes out of his well known paths.\n\nAlso there is something charming with this album, because even when Dark Tranquillity had their experimental times albums ago, in Projector, they assimilated that without denying or refusing their paths and without sending to hell their roots, like other bands had done (hint: something about flames). I see it kind of symbolic, to go back to the roots and leave the experiments away, even if the results were as brilliant as Projector and Haven were. So, by leaving that in the past, this is Gothenburg stuff at its best: The guitars sounds fierce and clear, with wonderful riffs and those brilliant breaks and silences that sound just as part of the main melody (like the one at 3'51'' of Hours Passed in Exhile), one can heard everything the drum does, there are wonderful melodies, and the trademark Dark Tranquillity's keyboards add deepness and colour to the music, always interchanged with the guitars in the main melody of the song, always giving a dark layer to the music, sometimes holding the music just to leave the guitars tear that slowness down at the next step. And if you add to that Mikael Stanne's brilliant voice (and oustanding lyrics), you have a very very good album, that is a pleasure to listen.\n\nSo yes, they have a recipe and they keep it everytime. But the resulting dish tastes very good and it's highly appreciated in these times where ancient metal gods poison their reputation with each new release.\n",
        "\nThis album hardly breaks any boundaries and is the most unoriginal album of Dark Tranquillity's career, yet I feel it is quite possibly their finest piece of work.\n\nThe biggest problem with the album is that the songs sound very similar to each other, which causes the album to lose steam over time unless you are obsessed with the style. Thank god the songs here are generally pretty good, or we would have one crap of an album. The style for just about every song is traditional gothenburg with some added atmospheric effects. All songs typically have a strong minor key, and this along with the artsy, melancholic atmospheres provide for songs that are a bit sad sounding yet are full of melody. Occassionally the band breaks out with a puching, half-thrash riff (see intro/main riff to \"White Noise/Black Silence\" which is an AWESOME riff), but most of the time the riffs move along on a single string in a minor key, a la traditional gothenburg. The main difference here is how polished this album is. The production is great, all instruments are very clear, the guitars sound pretty heavy, even Stanne's voice is mixed well enough that one can make out most lyrics. The best comparison I can think of in production is In Flame's \"Clayman\" album, but here the drums and guitars are both turned down a bit lower. \n\nBasically, we have a solid, consistent, gothenburg album throughout. The only song that doesn't fit the mold is the last one, which is a slow, haunting, almost doomy instrumental song. It's a decent song and sounds good when it's on, but it's nothing I would go out of my way to listen to. The only thing this album adds to the traditional gothenburg sound is that the songs have a more sophisticated/artsy feel to them. Normally this is not something I would care about, but here it adds just enough to keep the songs fairly interesting and forces me to come back to the album on an occasional basis. This album combines Dark Tranquillity's artistic ideas with their better songwritings ideas, easily making it one of their strongest efforts.\n",
        "\nAfter the very experimental Projector, DT came back with Haven. This album takes the experimental aspects of Projector and lessens them a bit and returns more to a gothenburg melodic death approach. Obviously, this would lead to the excellent Damage Done.\n\nBut, Haven is quite good on its own terms. A lot of melody is the constant factor with DT. And here you have tons of it, starting with \"The Wonders At Your Feet\". A curious title for a metal song but it works well and is a very good opener. \"Not Built To Last\" and \"Indifferent Suns\" follow the same path. One thing you will notice that there is not the variety you find on Projector. That is a good thing for some fans and bad thing for others.\n\nNext is \"Feast of Burden\" and with this song you realize the Maiden riff fascination with the gothenburg style. The title song comes next and brings some of the experimental aspects of Projector (along with \"Emptier Still\" towards the end of the album). Slower pace with electronic sounds and distorted vox. Its ok.\n\nThe rest of the album is pretty much in the same vein as the first few songs but I do want to state some standouts - \"Rundown\" is a blistering song and Stanne proves why he is one of the best vocalists (if not the best) in this genre. He oozes emotion and turmoil. The other standout song is the closer \"At Loss For Words\". The longest song on the album and a great mix of brutal and melodic parts. \n\nHaven, although not a great album, is much more digestable for metal fans than Projector and I can recommend this one with much more ease than its predecessor. However, personally, I like Projector is a tiny bit more.\n",
        "\nYeah, thats what I thought of when I recently pulled out this cd which I have not listened to in a long time. They remind me of that band for 2 reasons: Stanne's clean vocals and some of the keyboard atomosheric material on the album. Now, I know that the mention of that band in the same breath with the great DT will scare many metalheads. Well, it should. This is NOT for everyone.\n\nHeck, the first time I listened to the piano intro that starts \"Freecard\", I raised my eyebrow like the Rock and when the clean vocals of \"Therein\" kicked in, I put this thing away immediately. I did listen to it a couple of more times but never really dug the album. Until now.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, this does not compare to the greatness of Skydancer, Gallery, or their latest, Damage Done. But, its pretty good for what it is..........a metal Depeche Mode. Even the gothenburg tag fits loosely here. Keyboards, atmosheric sounding guitars, clean vocals, ....not what you expect from a metal album.\n\nI will say this - Stanne is one my fav vocalists of all time (at least his growling vocals). His death vox are unique and carry an emotional quality that is uheard by any other vocalists of this genre. He, alone, makes this album worth it. \n\nIn addition, the abstract lyrics are quite cool and always a stong point of DT albums. For example in the haunting and very melodic and Metallica/\"The Unforgiven\" sounding song \"Auctioned\" you have \"...my lip was venom/words formed in my mouth/hid beneath the tounge/never to be seen.\"There is also some female vocals as seen in \"Undo Control\". But it works when mixed with Stanne's incredible death vox delivery of \"I resist without control\".\n\nAgain, proceed with exteme caution with this one, even if you are a DT fan. But, I must admit that this did grow on me where I now enjoy spinning this disc quite often.\n",
        "\nGothenburg is to avant garde melodic death metal as San francisco was the thrash... indeed rarely does a single town yield such a multitude of cutting edge bands. DT are the guys who started this thing, and almost ten years after Skydancer comes Damage Done, their magnum opus. Damage Done is DT with all the fat trimmed off... elements from its predecessors are streamlined to an airtight malestrom of soaring, majestic melodies and superb songwriting (hows that for pretentious?). Along with Whoracle and Slaughter of the Soul, this belongs on any self respecting Gothenburg junkie's list of necessities. \n\nFinal Resistence opens off, shredding through monster riff after monster riff... of course there are cheesy keyboards everywhere, but Mikael Stanne's vo-KiLz provide an adequate check. Every song on Damage Done is memorable.... potentially mainstream without neglecting it's roots. The bombastic melodies and choruses have arena-rock power and mosh pit ferocity at the same time. \n\nA couple of my friends who like the Deftones more than Darkthrone have fallen for this disc. Regardless of ones preference for melodic death, Damage Done is just a damn good album.\n",
        "\nI had to write this review after checking the previous one. Rarely I come over reviews I so disagree about, and this CD is by far my favourite from DT. It's not that I don't like heavier Metal, or I didn't hear previous Dark Tranquility CDs. I do and I did. I rarely judge albums solely by heaviness, but always by quality of the songs, and I think that here DT reached the peak of their songwriting abilities. 'Haven' is still good, but I prefer this one, but I can understand why it was met with such hostility. I would not like it too if I was a hardcore fan of them _before_ hearing this album, but I became a fan _after_ hearing it, and that explains the difference of this review from the previous one.\n\nSo, assuming that whoever reads it doesn't know who DT are and what do they play on this album, I'll try to give a brief description. The style here is extremely melodic Death Metal bordering on Gothic, Stanne does excellently both harsh and melodic vocals, while keyboard takes the center stage at least a couple of time with melodic and sorrowful riffs. Guitars mostly follow vocals' style, they're more death-ish when Stanne is, and more laid back in other parts. The solos where they pop up are usually more moody than technical, and the whole atmosphere of the album is to combine the sorrow with aggression from previous albums. \n\n'Auctioned' shines here with incredible piano riff and mood and only clean vocals, and actually all the first 4 songs are good to great. One song that only I seem to like is 'Day to end'. Totally unlike everything DT done before, here and after, it has only clean vocals with very bare arrangement while guitars kick in only in the end. Very emotional song.\n\nThere are a couple or more songs here towards the end of the album that I like less, but I very rarely come upon albums that I like from start to finish. So that's it, a very good CD, with a quite unique style and at least 2 great and 4 good songs. Also a great introduction to whoever wants to approach Death Metal from its softer side.\n\nHighlights : Freecard, Therein, Undo Control, Auctioned, The Sun Fired Blanks, Day to End\n",
        "\nWell as with most bands, evolution and change takes place eventually. Some bands do it basically every cd, like Amorphis or the Gathering, while others take a few cds, like In Flames. Such is the case here, as the band's previous cds are different than this. \n\nThe band decided to go in a more mellow & melodic direction with this cd. They still have a bit of melodic death influences, but this is a very different release than the gallery or skydancer. Though its a not really a bad thing. I like to see a band evolve and try new things, as long as its not totally awful, like slayer attempting to be slipknot. So now onto the cd itself\n\nIt opens with Freecard which is a pretty good song and its DT the way we know them, just slowed down. Though it does open with piano, so this might turn people off right from the very start of this cd. ThereIn is next and this is pretty good at the start. Ok things aren't looking too bad for this cd, but wait, whats that. Clean vocals, thats what. While not a pitiful attempt at clean vocals like ohh in flames have just done, its somewhat cheesy, as its a sort of operatic & overdone clean style. Its standable, but not all that likable. The next song, well this is where the longtime fans will most likely be throwing the cd across the room. It opens with female vocals, until the usual DT vocals kick in, but only for a short period before the female vox come back. \n\nThe cd basically is like the songs I've already talked about, ranging from some old DT elements, to new stuff, like clean vocals, piano and other varities of \"going soft\". Regardless, I respect the band for this, as they wanted to make a cd that was different from their old cds and actually put more melodic elements into their music. For the most part it works, except for the clean vocals. They are better than the recent in flames attempt, but not all that enjoyable. The good news is, the band moved on after this cd back into a heavier direction, as evidenced by Haven and Damage Done.\n\nSo if you love DT, get this and you'll probably come to like it after a few listens. I'm a little mixed on the rating for this, as I do like the cd in the general. I'm going with a 50, as its right down the middle. This cd shouldn't be totally slagged nor loved. Take it as that, a mediorce release, but followed up by 2 good cds.\n\nbest songs imo: freecard, the sun fired blanks, on your time.\n",
        "\nAfter lingering in a more electronic direction with their release Projector, and coming back with a cleaner and more powerful sound on Haven, Dark Tranquillity successfully combines both elements into their recent masterpiece, Damage Done. Damage Done laces intense lyrics into their already strong music. \n\nBeginning with \"Final Resistance,\" Mikael Stanne navigates you through worlds of pain and anger. Through doubt and reistance: \"Hours Passed in Exile.\" Through lost love: \"Single Part of Two.\" Through (my personal favorite) loss and choas: \"The Treason Wall.\" Through realization and dissapointment: \"Damage Done.\" Through deception: \"I, Deception.\" And though infection and ideals: \"The Poison Well.\" \n\nThe power in the lyrics is only matched by characteristic intense guitar riffs and drum sequences. Damage Done also includes one intrumental track, Ex Nihilo, containing similar elements of the bonus track, \"I, Deception\" which encompasses, almost randomly, a distintly techno interlude half-way through.\n\nPowerful and meaningful, Damage Done remains at the top of my list.\n",
        "\nI thought Haven was decent, certainly was original, but it was lacking as far as riffs go and it all sounded the same. This cd however, is excellent. Ity mixes everything that was good about Haven with the intensity of their older material. The riffs on this album are much more intense, technical, and melodic. The singing is excellent as is expected of Stanne, he really has a unique voice that is instantly recognizable. The songs on this album change tempo and feeling quite often, unlike the previous release.\n\nMy favorite tracks on this album include \"Final Resistance\", \"Format C: for Cotrex\", \"Cathode Ray Sunshine\", and \"The Enemy\". The album is very consistent so all the of the songs are very good. \"Final Resistance\" is one of the faster, more crushing songs on this album. A great start to a great album. \"The Enemy\" is a slow-paced, emotional, and highly melodic song that offers a very good change of pace. \"ex Nihilo\" is an insturmental song that closes the album very well. It has an eerie feel to it, primarily due to the excellent use of electronics/keyboards in the song (which are used tastefully throughout the album).\n\nThis album can be reccomended for anyone into the Swedish Melodic Death style. This album is a breath of fresh air for the scene which I feel is still good but drifting from its roots (In Flames, Soilwork, even though they are still pretty good).\n",
        "\nAfter hearing about the band a couple years ago, I finally decided to check them out. I had heard a bit of Haven and I thought it was pretty good, so I decided I'd start from the beginning and purchase DT's first cd, Skydancer. I was very surprised to find that i was listening to an almost entirely different band. They had alot of the same members they have now, but they have changed greatly since 1993, to the point where they have almost no resemblance to their former sound. Here we have some fast, emotional, and powerful melodic death metal.\n\nThe playing on this album is all very tight and melodic, and the drums and bass compliment the guitars very well. The vocals, however, are somewhat strange at first. Anders Friden (now In Flames) is somewhat lacking on this album compared to his work with In Flames. However, the vocals still fit the music fairly well and on some places he does a very competent job. There is a female singer that appears here and there on some of the songs, and it fits in very well. The lyrics are all very poetic and good, even though i don't understand a word of it. Also worth mention are the excellent acoustic guitar parts that come in at very appropriate times, and end up sounding very beutiful.\n\nThe album opener \"Nightfall by the Shore of Time\" is a speedy track with some fast melodic parts. \"Crimson Winds\" begins with a beutiful duel lead that quickly becomes intense melodic death. My favorite on the album, \"A Bolt of Blazing Gold\" is next, with a nice acoustic intro that builds into an intensely emotional masterpiece, and ends with another fine acoustic piece. Another of my favorites on the album is \"Shadow Duet\", with its great melodic riffage and excellent gothenburg screaming duet by Anders and Michael Stanne.\n\nIf you are interested in the Gothenburg sound and want something that is more about melody and emotion than headbanging aggression, then I highly suggest you purchase this album. Although I greatly enjoy the latest offerings from DT, they are an almost entirely new band, and this form of Gothenburg style Death Metal is nearly extinct.\n"
