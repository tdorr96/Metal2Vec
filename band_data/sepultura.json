        "\n\u201cAfterburner\u201d is an album from ZZ Top. But this term also describes the relation between \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d and \u201cArise\u201d in an almost perfect manner, because the obvious intention behind \u201cArise\u201d was to continue the success formula of its predecessor. Okay, this is more than understandable in view of the fact that \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d lingers at an average of gigantic 93% after 28 reviews. And \u201cArise\u201d is also a great album, but the \u201cwow\u201d-effect of its older brother does not show up again.\n\nSepultura still stand with both feet firmly on the territory of thrash metal. No indigenous sounds, no endless percussion sessions and no excessive sense of mission dilute the pure metallic art. Of course, this does not mean that the output lacks diversity. But elements like the atmospheric guitar intro and intermezzo of \u201cDesperate Cry\u201d do not intend to take away the album its thrashing character. However, pure, straight and merciless neckbreaker like the opening title track or \u201cInfected Voice\u201d are rather a minority here. Nevertheless, the riffing of \u201cArise\u201d (the track) impressed Germany\u2019s Exumer so much that they recycled it on their 2016 album \u201cThe Raging Tides\u201d. Funnily enough, this riff also appears (in a very similar way) on their opening title track. Once again we learn that some riffs withstand the test of time with great ease.\n\nSepultura were already a lucrative brand after their third full-length. It comes therefore as no surprise that \u201cArise\u201d scores with a sharp, precise and powerful production. The guitars saw restlessly, the angry voice is neither dominant nor sidelined and the band increases the intensity always at the right moment. Maybe Scott Burns and Andy Wallace saw the border to sterility during the recording sessions, but they never crossed it. Not only the atmospheric beginning of the partly mild but steadily intensifying \u201cAltered State\u201d confirms this statement. Moreover, Burns and Wallace equipped the band with guitars that always convey a menacing undertone. For me, this is a very coherent and fitting mix.\n\nThe songs do not show off their progressive structures. Nevertheless, Sepultura have integrated some twists and turns. Especially the most opulent tracks (\u201cDesperate Cry\u201d and \u201cAlterer State\u201d) profit from this fact. But even the somewhat predictable songs do not fail. \u201cArise\u201d is totally free from stinkers and its configuration (nine songs in less than 43 minutes) is pretty perfect for their music. Thus, it is only logical that all songs work. Sometimes a bit better, sometimes a bit weaker, but the overall impression is really good. Today my favourite songs are the opulent and sinister \u201cDesperate Cry\u201d as well as the somewhat spooky \u201cUnder Siege (Regnum Irae)\u201d, but in view of the homogeneous design of the material, it can change already during the next days. Maybe this indicates the quality of the here reviewed work in the best way. To sum up, I still see \u201cArise\u201d as the afterburner of \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d, but is it a very hot one \u2013 and it still makes fun, even after more than three decades since its first release.\n",
        "\nIt's difficult to dislike this record. Thrashy enough to gather up all the thrash-heads in the universe for senseless mosh pitting spontaneously, it's also dark enough to satisfy the interested death-metaller in search of a more grisly quality to the music. Spiteful by nature and irreconcilably heavy, 'Arise' harkens back to the days of molten metal magma, when all the influences were pouring in from different scenes and grabbing the listener by the gut with its effusion of raw energy and contagious drive. It belongs to an era of extreme metal that is widely recognized as a golden age for the field, with bands releasing what is often seen as the most honest and raw version of death metal, as tons of emblematic records came out around that early period from Deicide, Obituary, Morbid Angel, Entombed, Hypocrisy, etc. Each of those bands had their own distinctive sound, their own take on shaping death metal, and were then free of the all-conforming influence of vastly enriched, autocratic labels. Sepultura, with 'Arise', was one of those pioneers.\n\nHistorically, Cavalera must be seen as one of the main guys that brought about that groove-metal spirit, with these big breaks on here that signal to the listener shit's about to go down (middle part in 'Dead Embryonic...', the end of 'Desperate Cry', among a myriad all across the record) - that jumpy, infectious energy that just made the listener headbang on the spot. They'd develop that dynamic more on the following 'Chaos AD' and even more so on the alternative and controversial 'Roots', with other main precursors Pantera and the earth-shaking breakdowns they were introducing to metal. This would later turn into post-thrash and full on groove-metal (Machinehead's 'Burn my Eyes'). Instead, the extreme bands were busy getting more brutal and explicit (growls, imagery, blast beats...) while a lot of the acts generally associated with groove at the time were probably more of the crossover bands like Prong, or even early Primus (that infamous giant breakdown groove from 'Jerry Was a Race Car Driver'). \n\nThe guitars (given a delightfully dark and heinous tone) have that sharp-edged, clinical precision from death metal with the better example probably being that stingy main riff to the opening title-track, which you'll probably remember the rest of your life. Most of the way though, it's the genre standard palm-muted shredding/power chords combo, eventually culminating in a rhythmic climax as described earlier. They also like to venture from time to time into these more peculiar riffs and leads, often of an exotic kind with lead guitarist Kisser instilling a bit of that Latin flavor into the mix to create melodies that sound unique to the band. The rebellious punkish component often present in Max Cavalera records can be recognized as the spine and drive to some of the parts, and there are probably more separate influences in this album than most people realize. Acoustic guitars and cinematic interludes play their cameo role tastefully for pacing.\n\nAll in all a real effort was put into crafting original tracks with distinctive features and a very impressive production for 1991, blending in different sub-genres to form a cohesive classic record with, notably, a seamless and powerful marriage of energetic heads-up thrash with darkened heads down death metal, in association with occasional atmospheric breaks. Finally, it's certainly one of the albums from the death metal spectrum that could usher in the realm of metal into a novice's life and must've served as a gateway for a great many once-curious minds about this most potent form of musical expression we call \"metal\".\n",
        "\nOut of Sepultura's early streak of thrash albums, Schizophrenia seems to be the one that's talked about the least. I see this usually getting little more than a passing mention in comparison to Morbid Visions or Beneath The Remains, generally called a transitional album between the two, and a glorified prototype of the latter. And to be fair, there's some truth to that. This album does not have the raw proto-black appeal and influence of the debut, nor the wider spread and streamlined aggression of the followup, which was actually their first album to be released on a major label, and, due to this, saw much wider exposure to the public. What it does offer, however, is a more unrestrained and, surprisingly, sophisticated take on that same approach to thrash metal that later became their claim to fame. Schizophrenia saw the light of day right around the time when thrash really began to expand beyond its basest conventions, incorporating a much wider range of heavier sounds and creative arrangements, and it pays heed to both in a way that gives it its own identity.\n\nSepultura's take on thrash is one that concentrates on a bludgeoning guitar sound, muted chugging and tremolo riffs, explosive drumming and punishing rhythmic breaks at appropriate moments. All trademarks of their thrash sound are present here: crushing, yet catchy riffs, chaotic shredding solos with a tinge of trad metal melodicism, and Max Cavalera's gruff, howling vocals. If you compare this to Beneath The Remains, however, you'll find that his vocals here are much lower in the mix, and they sound far more filthy and distorted. It gives the impression that he's calling out to the listener from some sort of deep chaotic abyss. This is further compounded by the lyrics, which are far more gruesome, but also less coherent and more of what is commonly known as \"Engrish\". \"From The Past Comes The Storms\" is all that needs to be said.\n\nHowever, there's far more to Schizophrenia than what initially meets the ear. This album's secret weapon lies not only in the increased emphasis on melody and busier riffing (\"To The Wall\" is a fine example of this), but specifically in the arrangements of the songs. You see, this album is a prime example of a songwriting approach known as the \"riff salad\". What this means, simply put, is that the songs do not possess clearly defined verses, choruses and bridges. Instead of having a set of rigid, recurring structural elements, they function largely as linear progressions of different riffs. This is the very same approach which would later become a staple of death metal.\n\nIndeed, this is the final piece of the puzzle that ties it all together while also reinforcing their \"death/thrash\" credentials. Though this album is already chock full of impressive riffs, they're structured in such a way that they just KEEP COMING, hitting you from every direction and giving the songs an added air of menace - again, something that death metal would grow to rely on extensively. Songs like \"From The Past Comes The Storms\" (bonus points for the tasty Engrish), \"Septic Schizo\" and especially the instrumental \"Inquisition Symphony\" rely heavily not just on the impact of the riffs themselves, but on how said riffs transition into and compliment each other without repeating themselves. This approach also draws you to the sheer number of said riffs, and it creates an epic and, dare I say, progressive feel to a lot of these songs, despite this being as far away from prog metal as most other old-school thrash albums. For a demonstration, listen to \"To The Wall\" or \"Inquisition Symphony\" - those songs manage to feel like an entire journey through their pacing and phrasing, and Sepultura accomplishes all of this with JUST RIFFS. No clean sections, no dedicated epic buildups, no uncommon time signatures, no real attempts at subtlety - just three Brazilian barbarians playing their asses off.\n\nThis kind of sound is something Sepultura never really recaptured later in their career. Their next two albums did this too, but to a much lesser extent, only really doing something similar during dedicated middle portions. The riffs on those albums are still quite effective at wrecking your neck, but here they are arguably even more impactful, adding constant anticipation and sudden changes to wholly different keys and tempos to create a constant assault on the senses that was rather unique for its day. The only notable thrash bands at the time that frequently used similar arrangements were Megadeth and, fittingly enough, Possessed, and even they weren't this overt about simply throwing riff after riff after riff at you.\n\nWhen all is said, Schizophrenia is a fine example of how relatively simple, barbaric riffs can be used in unique ways to create a distinct and memorable album. It is one that requires many listens to get the most out of it, but at the core, this is so much more than just a beta version of Beneath The Remains. Even then, speaking of said followup, its success can largely be attributed to taking the crunchy, pummeling aggression of this album, then adapting it to a more conventional songwriting approach. This is not the best of Sepultura - I'd say what came two years after barely wins out by having a more consistent set of catchy riffs - but it's very close, and still destroys the majority of other thrash albums of its time in both riffing dominance and creativity. Go and get it now, lest you be smashed by a holy shit. Don't worry, that's just Cavalera's epic Engrish poking its head out of the text.\n",
        "\nSplit from Steamhammer was released in 2006 to promote three albums released that year - \"Dante XXI\" from cult Sepultura was due out in March, \"Memorial\" from Portuguese band Moonspell in April, and Beyond Fear (Tim \"Ripper\" Owens' band) debut in May. There's no problem with getting it at the moment, and the prices are reasonable - I bought my copy on impulse many years ago, and since I did it without reading the description, I was quite surprised when I opened the package... \n\nThe CD was released in a paper envelope (personally I don't like such things), but what is surprising is its size: the carrier itself is only three inches long - the same size as e.g. USB modem or Wi-Fi router driver CDs. Such a small release is easy to misplace, and the CD itself almost falls out of the paper envelope at every opportunity (standard-size packages hold the contents much more securely); in addition, due to its size, the Steamhammer split does not fit anywhere: a traditional CD stand is out of the question, as the package flies through the ribbing, and gets lost on the shelf among its more grown-up brothers and sisters... Not much good can be said about the aesthetics either, as the cover is bland: really, they couldn't come up with anything more interesting than the first better Sepultura photo with a thumbnail of the upcoming album? It's very cheap. The back is ascetic: miniatures of \"Memorial\" and \"Beyond Fear\" with logos... and that's it.\n\nIt's good, though, that after putting the disc into the player there is something to listen to. Of course, the main star here is the Brazilian legend. \"Convicted in Life\" is the track thanks to which hope could be revived - hope that after the average last two albums we will get at least a solid disc. The song is fast and dynamic; it rushes at breakneck speed driven by a simple but catchy riff, Cavalera pounds the drums like a madman and Derrick spits out his next words with genuine fury. 20 years have passed since the debut \"Morbid Visions\" and the musicians have managed to find a youthful, almost punk-like energy, which was severely lacking on their previous releases. After this great, short number we jump to \"Finisterra\" by Portuguese Moonspell. The song heralded one of the heaviest LPs in the band's history: forget the earlier gothic rock/metal records - get ready for dark, almost death-like playing. The Wolves are back and they're bloodthirsty: the number lasts just over four minutes and doesn't get boring even for a second. Changes of pace, Gaspar's double foot, great guitar work, Ribeiro shouting as if he wanted to tear someone apart - it's hard to believe that this is the same band that wrote \"How We Became Fire\", \"The Antidote\" or \"The hanged Man\". What can complement punk/thrash and death metal laced with gothic sauce? Of course... heavy metal? Tim Owens' band fits in here like a fist to a nose and it would be better for the listeners if a band representing a slightly stronger style appeared in their place. Of course the number is not bad; it reminds of what \"Ripper\" did with his Judas Priest bandmates on \"Demolition\" and \"Jugulator\". If you like low guitars, medium tempos and Tim's high voice - check out the full album. It's solid.\n\nAll labels release such CDs for promotional purposes and many of them later become a kind of \"white raven\" sought after by fans of a given group. However, the discussed album does not belong to this category, because from a collector's point of view it is for nobody. Beyond Fear released only one album, so no one will build their collection, while \"Finisterra\" got its own single (and it's worth looking for). Considering the fact that Sepultura is on the cover, maybe the split will interest their faithful fans, but don't they have more interesting (and rarer) releases to find? It seems to me that it would be better for them if this promo included only the first track and was released in a normal size - then there would be some collector's value. This split CD is just a curiosity.\n\n(Originally written for www.metalside.pl)\n",
        "\nSepultura's career certainly had its ups and downs, from their brutal death metal roots to their forgettable nu metal and tribal-influenced days, but the band's thrash metal era was definitely their peak. Beneath the Remains and Arise are the two pure thrash records, released during the tail end of thrash metal's golden age, but they are two pillars of South American thrash that perfectly embody the region's sound. Brutal. Technical, but not overly polished to the point that any emotion is sucked out. And most of all, fun as hell to listen to. \n\nAfter a warm intro, the band gets right into the carnage with pummeling riffs and Max Cavalera's growls. The guitar tone sounds tough and chunky, and as the band transitions from one riff to another the intensity never lets up. All of the songs on this album are perfectly crafted to showcase the sheer heaviness the band's sound was birthed from. The most comparable sound would be Sarc\u00f3fago's debut, but Sepultura executes deathrash to a caliber that very few other bands can match. The tremolo picking from Max's riffs glides smoothly over Andreas Kisser's bass lines to create this uniform beam of riffing, and it's a sound that feels very unique to the band (even if the band utilizes some Metallica-esque chugging every once in a while).\n\nThis album is loaded with little tricks that add a haunting effect, like the guitar lick at 2:20 on \"Inner Self\" (and elsewhere on the album). Max uses an echo on some of the vocal passages as well, creating this distant, ghostly delivery. Most of the songs sound like they don't have a hook, even if they do, but they're dynamic enough to where it actually helps. A distinct hook would soften the sound, and Sepultura keeps the focus on the riffs, the core of the genre. Any good thrash band knows an album isn't built on hooks, it's built on riffs.\n\nThe strongest songs are on the A-side, but the B-side is far from a slouch. \"Lobotomy\" has some epic drum fills, especially on the bridge, and the soaring guitar solos on this song and the rest perfectly contrast the solemn atmosphere that's created. The songs feel well-written, tight, and meaningful. It isn't that the lyrics are anything atypical for the genre (death, hatred, suffering, the usual), but the music behind them is so forceful that they come across incredibly harsh, in a good way.\n\nOf course, no thrash album would be complete without exquisite production. The mix on this album is very clean, all of the instruments are loud and the precision playing is reminiscent of the remastered version of Bonded by Blood from Exodus, but Sepultura doesn't go overboard. This record is produced with enough clarity to let the technicality shine, but it still maintains that edge that made Schizophrenia (their previous release) such an uncompromising listen. The songs are heavy and thick, but the band seems to have mastered translating the rage of their previous releases into brilliant songwriting. There are very few albums in thrash (and even in death metal) that come across with this much ferocity while keeping the clever song structures and catchy rhythms intact. Arise is a great album too, but Beneath the Remains was the best thrash album of 1989, and makes a case for the best thrash album ever recorded.\n",
        "\nWhen you ask any metalhead, or at the very least someone with a general knowledge about heavy metal and thrash metal, how much they know of Sepultura, usually the first albums they speak of is their classic thrashers such as \u201cBeneath The Remains\u201d and \u201cArise\u201d or their more popular groove metal and nu-metal outputs \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d and \u201cRoots\u201d. Very little do I hear \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d being talked about and even to a lesser extent do I hear others talk about the album I\u2019m reviewing today, \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d. I guess to make things direct, I do not care for this record very much. I assume, at least here on Metallum, I seem to be in the minority that finds this record to be of poor quality, though I will say it\u2019s not very bad.\n\nThe first thing I always read or hear is how \u201craw\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d sound, which I wholeheartedly agree with. It does sound evil, it does sound raw but that isn\u2019t verification to quality. I like to take into consideration all the components whenever I form a critique about music, or anything in general, and the thing about \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d is that, when I take all sums of its parts, the album as a whole is of lower quality that some don\u2019t necessarily would like to admit. Again, I don\u2019t think \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d is that bad of a record, it\u2019s just a half-way decent debut.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything really positive I can say about \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d is that it does have some fairly interesting moments. One of the things I\u2019m pleased about about the record is that it does a great job at creating a, no pun intended, morbid sound and sinister atmosphere all around. Like I agreed with earlier, the whole album drips a raw evil that is comparable to your early black metal records you\u2019d find in the darkest corners of your local record store. Matter of fact, the record feels much more in line with early black / death metal more so than thrash, though that\u2019s a topic I\u2019ll come back to shortly. There are also some interesting drum fills, riff and tempo changes, and even some nice solos here and there. I do like some of the more technical aspects in songs such as \u201cWar\u201d and \u201cFuneral Rites\u201d, but that\u2019s where most of my positive comments lie. \n\nOverall the record is full of amateurish writing, simple riff structures, poor production (even for 1986), and some really sloppy performances all around. Max Cavalera vocally is very much more on the side of early black / death metal, with the echo effect enhancing more of those black metal characteristics, but it\u2019s clear at this time he was not much of a singer, coming off key and odd at a number of instances. Even with some impressive speedy and hectic guitar playing, Max and Jairo T. are overall particularly sloppy, missing notes in both the main riffing and solos. The same can be said about Max\u2019s brother, Igor, on the drums as he beats the living hell out of the kit though missing some beats and having some odd fills here and there. What it feels to me is that the need for speed and aggression out weighed their actual skill that they were able to produce. Max, Igor, and Jairo can, for most of the album, keep a standard sense of rhythm and pace but majority of the writing is very straightforward and simple in structure. \n\nIt\u2019s so straightforward that a portion of songs begin to sound like runoffs or using riffs from their other songs with some minor tweaks. Listen to both openings to \u201cTroops Of Doom\u201d and \u201cEmpire Of The Damned\u201d and tell me they don\u2019t share some similarities. Lyrically it\u2019s also fairly straightforward. You got your songs about death, satan, total destruction, war (literally the song name), and so on and so forth. I\u2019m not going to criticize much regarding the lyrics as it is well documented that our Brazilian friends here didn\u2019t know too many English definitions, and usually imitated the lyrics from their influences and used dictionaries to look up words. All I will say is that the lyrics are pretty simple and have some grammatical issues throughout. \n\nProduction is really poor as well. As I mentioned a few paragraphs before regarding \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d obvious influences from the realm of black metal and feeling more like a black / death record than thrash at this time, I\u2019ve seen people use this as a justification for a positive critique. To counter that point, I like to look at other works, from either early black metal bands or thrash metal bands that start off with some black metal influences during their beginning. Bands like Bathrory, Celtic Frost, and Venom (which seem to be clear influences to the band) have released black metal records almost a year or more before \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d, with a better utilization of their respective sounds. Even Sodom\u2019s debut that came out the same year as \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d, \u201cObsessed With Cruelty\u201d, had a much fairer production. Those records still had that grimy, sinister, evil feel to them with atmosphere dripping at every second without sacrificing their overall sound. \n\nOne of my biggest issues is how thin the guitars sound. They lack no punch or definition and come off fairly weak. As I mentioned with the bands above, their records during this time still had a heavy, distorted sound to their guitars and carried weight. Here, it's all too muted, which is odd as I found their guitar sound on their ep, \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d to be much better with a more meaty guitar sound. The bass really is just there, not too high in the mix but at least noticeable, but unremarkable. The overall sound of the drums isn\u2019t too bad but it really tries to dominate the mix, coming off too loud. I\u2019ve read someone compare it like a battle between the guitars and the drums to be the centerpiece in the mix in a much more positive light and I will agree with that observation, though I\u2019m on the opposite side and think it\u2019s an outright negative as being able to hear all the instrumentation and singer equally will elevate the music as a whole. You can still have that same chaotic and evil feel without sacrificing the overall quality. \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d just has a really poor production and mix, regardless if it\u2019s influenced by early black metal production as they miss the mark that those records were able to accomplish. \n\n\u201cMorbid Visions\u201d sets the groundwork for what is to come for Sepultura yet it\u2019s not a record of tremendous quality some deem it to be. There\u2019s some skillful pieces to be found across the record, and some satisfactorily drum and guitar work but what really brings the whole record down is the combination of sloppy playing, poor production, and some straightforward and simple writing that comes off highly amateurish. I mean, compare other debuts from their thrash peers and their influences from within the heavy and black metal genres. \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d just does not hit the highs those records set forth. I personally don\u2019t find \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d to be a noteworthy album to discuss, which may be a reason why it doesn\u2019t pop up in discussions much, and would rather start with \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d when I\u2019m talking about Sepultura or recommending where to start with the band but if you really need to be a completionist in regards to hearing all that a band has produced, \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d isn\u2019t a terrible listen, it\u2019s just very \u201cmeh\u201d or some what decent. It\u2019s clear the band tried to imitate their heroes and influences and I think it resulted in a poorer record. Luckily their sophomore material results in a much better effort and fully realized album.\n",
        "\nI've listened to plenty of albums that have been hated on for a change of style. Some are justified, others seem unfair. Regardless, \"Roots\" may be a more extreme example of this type of hatred for an album. Coming from the Brazilian band Sepultura, these guys were huge in the late 80s and early 90s for their death and thrash metal albums, with \"Beneath the Remains\" in particular being a landmark of the death/thrash metal genre. Starting with \"Chaos A.D.\", however, they began to add in some groove metal elements. By the time we got to \"Roots\" in 1996, they went all out in the nu/groove metal style, and that didn't suit well for fans of Sepultura to say the least. At least with stuff like Celtic Frost's \"Cold Lake\", the hate eventually died down, and people started to like some portions of it. 25 years later, the hate wagon for \"Roots\" is still going strong. Even those who liked the album just \"liked\" it, and never loved it.\n\nSo where do I stand on this issue? Well for the most part, you either like \"Roots\", or loathe every second of it. There is no in-between. For me, personally, I'm more in the middle, but I do lean a lot on its positives. Sure, it has its rather dumb moments and it is one of the weaker nu/groove metal projects at the time, but generally, this album is pretty good.\n\nLet's start off with the instruments. The instrumentals of \"Roots\" may be a far cry from the ones in previous albums, but they're still great. The guitar riffs are really bouncy, and they have a nice groove to carry a variety of emotions. The drums are also pretty good, as its beat patterns are very groovy and rhythmic, further executing the crazed atmosphere of the tracks. The bass is rather mundane and doesn't do much for most of the tracks, but when it's good, it does provide the foundation for the tracks well. One of the best examples of the instruments would be in the hit single \"Roots Bloody Roots\". While not their best song ever, it is one of the best songs off the album, with the tribal themes being executed very well and the guitars playing harsh, yet ritualistic riffs. Others tracks that have good instruments would be \"Attitude\", \"Spit\", and \"Ambush\". They're one of the best parts of the album, and have some genuinely great moments.\n\nBut one of the weaker portions of this album would be the vocals. Max Cavalera has done the vocals for Sepultura before, and they've been great. Here, however, it's been downgraded a lot. Like many other nu metal projects, Cavalera's vocals are very whiny and groan a lot. This won't be a problem if his voice was fitting to the instruments, but they aren't. For example, in the track \"Breed Apart\", the song goes for a more harsh and crazed atmosphere, and it works. However, Cavalera begins to groan very softly to the lyrics, and it sounds awful. And when he does scream, it sounds forceful and is completely out of place from the instruments. They're not the worst things ever, but the vocals end up dragging down the tracks. And don't even get me started on Jonathan Davis and Mike Patton's vocals on \"Lookaway\". Their vocals are very degrading and make this rather average song sound unbearable. And that's not to mention the rapping part in \"Ratamahatta\", which is terrible and out of place with the tribal sounds. Even with some of the more tolerable vocal moments like in \"Roots Bloody Roots\", they are poor overall.\n\nWhile the vocals are garbage, the lyrics are okay. They may not be that impressive, but they can be worded fine and tell a story just fine. For example, in the track \"Cut-Throat\", this verse quotes:\n\nTelling lies right into your face,\ngrab your soul and make a disgrace.\nMake you believe you're bigger than life,\nno one cares if you'll live or die.\n\nCavalera talks about someone lying and thinking they're better than everyone else. The lyrics are decent, but the main problem is that the vocals are horrible, and Cavalera screaming his head off make the lyrics look like he's making a big deal out of someone making up lies. And sometimes, even the lyrics are the main problem. Going back to \"Ratamahatta\", the lyrics are just random chants of Portuguese words. While it is about living in Brazilian slums like favela, the abrasive instruments and whining vocals ruin whatever storytelling Cavalera was going for. The lyrics can be okay, but it's either ruined by the vocals or the poor wording.\n\nAfter all of those years, \"Roots\" still remains a rather odd album in Sepultura's discography. The vocals are awful, and the lyrics are downgraded by their poor execution, but the instruments are mainly nice and are unique with its influence of tribal sounds. Max would go on to leave Sepultura and instead start up a new band named Soulfly, and while he still views this album as an important record, fans still have a hard time listening to it. It does have its problems, but it's still harmless overall, and it's worth checking out if you're interested in some nu/groove metal combined with tribal sounds.\n",
        "\nWhich thrash metal fan wouldn't be familiar with the amazing thrash records that Sepultura released earlier on during the 1980s? Schizophrenia and Beneath The Remains deserve to be called some of the greatest thrash records of all time. That makes me ask the question a thousand times, how did we go from there to here? There, from the ripping, intelligent riffs, pretty damn good speed, respectable vocal work, unsurpassed energy to here, where nothing, NOTHING is worthy of being called \"music\".\n\nMaking a difference between songs becomes quite difficult, as every single song is based on the exact formula, except for the so-called \"Canyon Jam\" which has nothing to do with the rest of the record. Riffin' for dummies, the riffs are consisting of the most basic ascend-descend bullshit, the same FUCKING drum beat that in their opinion, never gets old, and the idiotic screams that sound laughable (later depressing, 'cause they were serious about it). To make this even more enjoyable, most of this takes place at roughly the same exact pace. This never changes. \n\nMusicianship? Pure garbage. These guys were some of the greatest thrash musicians that would wipe bands like Sodom and Kreator off the stage during their prime. They clearly knew what they were doing, they were extremely talented that was proven by their very sophisticated albums. Here? As if they were purposefully trying to sound as bad as possible. The riffs have no variety, nor any aggression. They are extremely simplistic, boring, dry, and extremely repetitive. I do not think I ever heard riffs being repeated this many times during one album, though this would stand out less if the riffs were any good. But they are not, and things only get worse. \n\nAfter the guitar work that can be compared to that of a beginner drunk scene kid, the percussion also fails. If I did not know this was Igor Cavalera, I would have laughed my ass off and said \"You're joking, right?\". Unfortunately, no. This is not only a bad dream. Igor Cavalera was a great drummer. He was not the best, but his fills were on point, he was able to play very tightly on very high speeds, might I add. Here, he is on one single drum beat, on this slow, sluggish idiotic pace, that's determined to annoy you as much as it possibly can. You would expect some twists and turns in the pace, the beat, the fills, etc. Nope, not on this album, my friend. \n\nWhen you add all of these things together, you get something so unlistenable, so repulsive, and disgusting that it is literally painful to listen to. There are no melodies on the album. Okay, fine, there are a lot of great albums without melodies. There is no aggression either. Alright, maybe there is some punk-like energy where the music is simple, but at least it has a decent pace to it, and there are some catchy moments. No, the pace is way too slow for that, and the music is not sophisticated enough. What is there on this album that makes it enjoyable!? Is there anything that the album is trying to communicate besides these idiotic, boring, dry caveman riffs that can be written in minutes, and Max Cavalera's horrible moaning that's worse to listen to than a cat's agony? \n\nNothing on here works. The riffs are empty, they don't try to communicate anything. There is no meaning to them. When I listen to these riffs, I don't tell myself \"Wow, man, this must have taken some brains to come up with. It's philosophy in the form of notes.\" I tell myself \"Just put that fucking guitar down and end my suffering.\". The percussion is boring, dull, repetitive, and sounds like a free downloadable drum beat from YouTube that's basically a 15-second loop. No variety in the drumming either. The vocals are \"fragments of what used to be\" Max Cavalera's vocals. The production is horrible, none of the instruments sound clean. This has been the most painful listen I ever endured in my entire life. This is the first album that managed to cause physical pain while I listened to it. This level of musical carpet bombing on the ears (and on the psyche) should be a crime.\n",
        "\nSepultura are the first Brazilian, and also the first South American band, that I ever got to hear. 'Arise', the band's fourth full-length album, is one of the first thrash metal albums I ever got to hear, after Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Kreator and Suicidal Tendencies. It was like from another planet. I remember its aura was mystifying, otherworldly and \"something else\".\n\nA few days ago 'Arise' turned 30 years old. The album haven't aged a bit. The music is classic yet still absolutely vital, and the lyrics never get old, sadly. Eerie industrial sounds open the album before the band blast into action. Industrialism really entered metal music after the change to 1990s, and thrash metal was its true harbinger. State of the dying world had been noticed and these \"childish metalheads\" (as I've so often heard metalheads called as) did not want to be silent about it.\n\n\"Laboratory sickness, infects humanity. No hope for cure, die by technology.\" - 'Dead Embryonic Cells'\n\n\"Terrorist confrontation. Waiting for the end. Wartime conspiracy.\" - 'Arise'\n\n\"Censored ideas, counterfeit answers.\" - 'Altered State'\n\n\"I can't trust anymore. Criminals within the law. I have something to say. Where I live, don't believe in another day\" - 'Murder'\n\nBrazil was and is partly a very brutal place, and these young fellows at their early twenties were more than conscious about it all. Politicians, religions, and religious decision maker, and generally belligerent and people causing devestation all get their shares of wrath. The lyrics are straight-to-the-point and lurid. Max Cavalera's beary thras-throat vocals are filled with anger. The fantastic surreal Michael Whelan artwork cannot be ignored. It certainly reinforces the ominous atmosphere of the album. One of the legendary album cover artworks.\n\nWhile 'Arise' isn't only a thrash metal album but a death/thrash metal amalgamation, it does not include very fast thrash metal, even though it is a bloody enraged album. The title track's riffing, drum kit-bashing and rapid vocalization together with 'Infected Voice' are only full fast songs here, since the band often pull into mid-paced whacking. The band effortlessly fluctuate between (around) 76-161 beats per minute (on 'Beneath the Remains' 2 years earlier the tempos were 106-226 BPM, but even slower on earlier albums!). The atmosphere is totally thick throughout.\n\nThe riffs are often ugly and nasty, as are lead guitar melodies. There's some rapid good old thrash riffs, and generally the slower ones are just good old thrash riffs in slower tempo; from ripping to slower ripping, hah! They just have more space to breathe. Warped soloing is essential part for building up the bent vibes. The guitars are simply catchy, thanks Max Cavalera's and Andreas Kisser's sharp pens. Kisser's melodiusness reminds me of 'Testimony of the Ancients' by Pestilence, but that album was created simultaneously with' Arise'... Just like the industrial sounds on here, some acoustic guitar bits add to the ominous tone. There's some truly out-there parts in the songs, e.g. how the music sounds like it was played backwards ('Desperate Cry') and the highly moody tribalistic start of 'Altered States'.\n\nThe Scott Burns production here was one of the heaviest ever back in the early 1990s. The guitars are crisp and extensive, very much skull-drilling. The bass guitar, played by Kisser (Paulo Jr. actually played bass first time on album on 1993's 'Chaos A.D.') isn't outstanding due to its guitar-ish tone, plus it follows guitars and drums closely, but does its job in the end. However, Igor Cavalera, Max's younger brother, plays some recognizable beats. His style is sometimes very tribal-ish, meaning simplistic yet powerful, but also there's some Latin drumming elements in his playing.\n\nSepultura never created two similar albums with their classic line-up. Some didn't like the slower song material on 'Arise', but then again, it became a bonafide classic for multitude of metalheads. It still sounds very unique to this day, and it is a fucking oppressive, a dangerous one, and I love it to bits!\n\n(Originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com)\n",
        "\nTwenty years ago, Brazil's most famous metal exploit Sepultura continued their ascent into the 90s as expected, after a clockwork-steady improvement was shown from release to release since their 1985 debut to 1989\u2019s tremendous deathrashterpiece Beneath the Remains. Already bringing out two exceptional metal super powers in Scott Burns' sound and Michael Whelan's art inherited from said album, the band's fourth LP, Arise was bound to succeed and continue that ascension. And for the most part, it did. While Arise features an even better sound and mixing than Beneath the Remains, the band did choose to simplify some of their musical traits, in particular some of their rhythmic riffs and drumming patterns, while adding more atmospheric traits to some of their compositions. This was done consciously, as the quartet was already in top form in terms of musical proficiency. The result remains quite enticing, though sometimes the simplicity can lead to predictable moments within the album, and that's why I think this is a slight step back in overall quality in comparison to its predecessor. \n\nBe as it may, Arise sounds as monstrous as foreshown by the Lovecraftian monstrosity on the cover. Andreas Kisser's rhythmic riffs crush as if entire buildings are being pulverized by the action of Great Old Ones' tentacles as they bring an unholy and violent end to Mankind's Age. The solos and melodies cut like red-hot giant tendrils piercing the soft throats of hapless victims. The drums have a special sound to them; the snare hits seem to be produced by a wooden device for crushing limbs, while the dual drum basses have a more subdued clicky sound. The air toms also appear to have begun adopting the tribal quality that Sepultura would explore even more in their future material. It's a very organic affair and I really dig the sound, even if all the plates appear to be compressed and somewhat muted. While the bass guitar is not that prominent, the lines can be heard at all times, and sometimes, even the plucking of its strings. As for Max's voice, he's just as dominant as usual, with his trademark ferocious grunts between a thrash metal shout and a death growl. \n\nAs for the compositions within, I feel the record's a bit lopsided starting with the best and leaving the lesser for last, though the differences in quality and memorability are not too pronounced. The iconic title-track begins with a brief industrial intro and then explodes, going straight for the head of the listener and pummeling its brain into pulp with an aggressive fast tempo. As I mentioned earlier, some of Igor's drumming patterns here are quite simple, if fast and precise, with a lot of d-beat hardcore influence. The song has a terrific breakdown in the middle, a short and squeaky solo and amazing set of riffs. It is soon followed by an even better track in \u201cDead Embryonic Cells\u201d, one of my favorite Sepultura tunes and my top one here. It has its own cool industrial intro, and traverses more tempo changes than the straightforward opener but just as punishing, only with more varied riffs, all of which remain stellar. It also features a great breakdown with Igor abusing the crash (or is it the china?) plate and some twisted melodies before giving way to the final appearance of the bridge and chorus. Prime deathrash right there. Track number 3, \u201cDesperate Cry\u201d is my preferred one of the two six-minute cuts, with vintage thrash rhythmic riffs, yet another amazing breakdown that's longer and more complex still than the one in the preceding track, and a twisted, melancholic Kisser solo. It has more double bass as well, and aesthetically, appears to have more in common with Beneath the Remains.\n\nThe rest of the tunes continue to assault the listener in the same fashion, though some atmospheric respite is provided from time to time, like the Amazonian intro and the haunting clear guitars in \u201cAltered State\u201d, or the phantasmal narration in \u201cUnder Siege\u201d. \u201cMurder\u201d, \u201cSubtraction\u201d and closer \u201cInfected Voice\u201d are more straightforward thrashers, albeit with enough tempo changes in them as not to become boring. Those are the tracks I prefer the less, but they'll make you rattle your skull nonetheless. \u201cMeaningless Movements\u201d is my preferred song from the second half, with varied array of rhythmic riffs and different sections, as if Voivod had somewhat helped with the composition. The lyrics for the whole album are simply, but expose the usual Cavalera themes; world chaos, political trickery, emotional and psychological turmoil, the degradation of society and the natural environment, sometimes from a general view and other times from a more subjective perspective. These themes would be greatly expanded upon for their divisive next record, where the band embraced groove metal, seemingly for good. Thus, Arise is perceived by many as the final chapter to classic Sepultura. I might be in the minority of holding Chaos A.D. in even higher regard, but that's a story for another time.\n",
        "\nLet me start with a little statistic. At the time of this writing, the first four Sepultura albums have an average rating of 88.75%. \"Chaos A.D.\" still reaches 70%, while the ten long players from \"Roots\" to \"Quadra\" are at 61.1%. The average would be even lower if the number of reviews of the individual albums were taken into account: 20 people reviewed \"Roots\" with an average of 50%, whereas the 87% of \"Quadra\" is based on only four opinions. What I want to say is: apparently it's largely consensus that Sepultura have only produced lukewarm shit since \"Arise\". \n\nWell, when I hear \"Kairos\", I cannot disagree with the prevailing opinion. It's rather shocking that this album is still ranked at 74% today. The 2011 work starts quite solidly with the sawing guitars of \"Spectrum\" and the opener quickly develops an apocalyptic dark tinge. Although the track remains stuck in the mire of mid-tempo, the threatening melodies do not remain without effect. The following title track is in a similar vein. With the one-word chorus of \"Kairos\" I always think it is the little brother of the chorus of \"Nomad\", but that is a venial sin. Again, the song bumbles along at a medium tempo, but otherwise shows its teeth. From the third title onwards, even I recognise a clear pattern. \"Kairos\" does not emphasise speed, even if parts of \u201cNo One Will Stand\u201d try to score with high velocity. The record is more about creating a dense darkness. This works reasonably well at the beginning, but it wears out quickly - and the album only ends after more than 53 minutes. The Ministry cover, for whose performance there is absolutely no reason in my view, and the completely pale, meaningless \"Dialogue\" do their best to throw \"Kairos\" off track. In fact, the album doesn't really find its way back on track either.\n\nThere are hardly any moments of suspense, inter alia because of the little variety concerning the riffs. A quite decent solo here (\"Mask\", a track that is, by the way, at least in phases fast and dynamic), and every now and then a deadly melody that makes you sit up and take notice (the beginning and the end of \"Born Strong\"), that's it. But in addition there are the weak vocals of Derrick Green, who has the dynamic and the charisma of a bridge pillar, and rather lifeless drums. You can listen to all that, but it's not very exciting. \"Refuse / Resist\", \"Beneath the Remains\" or \"To the Wall\" were in a different league, just to name three of many.\n\nThe result is a relatively powerful, but also somewhat dully produced album, whose creative potential is exhausted after 35 to 40 minutes. You get the feeling that Sepultura want to prove through quantity that they are still relevant, but that's not how the game works. Very few metalheads will fall into endless enthusiasm to the droning guitars of tracks like \"Embracing the Storm\". What's the average since \"Roots\"? 61.1%? I am generous. \"Kairos\" is worth 62% to me.\n",
        "\n\u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d has become a prime example for the positive part of the make-it-or-break-it slogan which is omnipresent when it comes to the third album of a promising band. It catapulted Sepultura on the global map of thrash. Of course, \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d had already been a big step forward after the pretty crude \"Morbid Visions\", but \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d marked a real quantum leap, maybe not in terms of the musical quality, but with respect to the degree of attention the dudes received. It was amazing. Sepultura were the new darlings of Metal Hammer and further metal \u201cmass media\u201d.\n\nAnyway, \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d was and still is a good album. It does not have the explosiveness of its precursor. Moreover, \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d scores with a higher level of juvenile defiance. Honestly speaking, I am sure that the more controlled approach opened the quartet the door to the metallic high society. Doubtlessly, tracks like \u201cLobotomy\u201d or in particular \u201cPrimitive Future\u201d are fiery thrash projectiles. Their jagged riffs, their cool melody fragments and the average velocity make it easy to enjoy them. I just miss one iota of madness, the ingredient that made tracks like \u201cEscape to the Void\u201d that fascinating. On the other hand, the album from 1989 proved evidence that the Brazilians had learned to write catchier and more compact tracks. It goes beyond my imagination that Sepultura could have thought about putting another seven-minutes-instrumental in the centre of the album.\n\nFrom the beginning to the end, the entire material scores with great riffs and especially the first three tracks are absolutely terrific. Sepultura create long-lasting effects with simple means. Single parts like the bridge of the opening title track (\u201cWho has won? Who has died?\u201d) need exactly only one spin to keep sticking in the ear. \u201cInner Self\u201d convinces with its dynamic tempo changes, its great riffs and the evergreen outlaw attitude of its lyrics. \u201cStronger Than Hate\u201d mixes intensive high velocity sections with some less furious sounds. It has some rather melodic guitar parts that give the song an individual note, although it possesses a lot of generic thrash riffing as well. This triple strike at the beginning of the album shows impressively that Sepultura were not just the next media hype. Of course, Roadracer Records guaranteed them a better distribution, a higher budget and an almost omnipresent lobby than Shark Records or any other company before. Nevertheless, it would be wrong to call them just profiteers of the next hype.\n\nOf course, a little bit of criticism is also necessary. \"Beneath the Remains\" could perhaps use a little more variety. But taken on its own, every single song scores. Even \"Mass Hypnosis\", which only has rather flat verses and a relatively weak chorus, improves considerably in the middle part and serves up many good melodies out of nowhere, with a surprising break thrown in for free. Apart from that, there is nothing to complain about. The production deserves no extra praise, but no criticism either. Without the charm of the underground, but with a good portion of clarity, directness and guts, \"Beneath the Remains\" pounds out of the boxes. Whether due to conviction or zeitgeist, here Metal Hammer and Co finally promoted the right ones.\n",
        "\nSepultura's 3rd album is just bludgeoning and for me the best album to ever come out South America period, there is no competition from any other band from that continent past, present, and future that could even pump out something that even stacks up to this. This album is just that damn good and Sepultura put Brazil on the map for thrash metal and basically started the scene there back in the mid 80's paving the way for bands like Attomica, Acid Storm, Korzus, and many more. Beneath the Remains is one of the best representations of when thrash metal meets death metal and Sepultura had perfected this formula by this release. This album is packed with some of the most primitive and violent sounding riffs that just create the unique barbaric atmosphere this album carries. Majority of the barbaric just straight up primitive thrash was never my style as most of it was just horribly produced or the band was just trying to be overly heavy to where the album just turns into a muddy mess of nonsense. Beneath the Remains however is barbaric and primitive done at its absolute best and also features some pretty atmospheric clean guitar moments as well. This album sounds super professional compared to the previous 2 releases from the band but still keeps that brutal vibe and pacing throughout the entire album and never lets off the gas. \n\nThe production/mix on this release was definitely a massive step up from Schizophrenia and Schizophrenia was just monstrous even with the sub par production that record was still crushing especially with the addition of Andreas Kisser. Beneath the Remains just ups the intensity several notches and with a cleaner more vibrant sounding production. The guitars are downright savage and have that scooped mids sound of the day. Kissers lead tone here is the best in his entire career saturated in reverb and delay and despite the primitive atmosphere of this album his leads are really emotional and packed with immense amount of feeling. The lead in \"Mass Hypnosis\" is just immaculately phrased and will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. The bass tone here is crisp and sleek the outro of \"Stronger Than Hate\" showcases the beautiful bass tone and it's pretty much just Kisser laying down a beautiful melodic piece of bass playing that ends the song. Yes as odd as it is Paulo did not record bass on any of the classic Sepultura releases as he started recording with the band when they started to suck in 1993 which I did not know for the longest time. \n\nMax and Igor are at their peak here both are honed in on their craft at a staggeringly brilliant level. Igor is at his prime and is one of the tightest drummers in the metal genre as a whole. The drum sound is amazing here as you can hear every piece on his kit being used with extreme clarity throughout this record and he puts on a drum clinic for the entire album. The most mind blowing thing about Igor here is that he was only 19 at the time of this albums release which is just ridiculous the dude is still one of my all time favorite drummers no matter how bad Sepultura would get with the release of Chaos A.D. in 1993. Max is also in his most evil sounding form on Beneath the Remains. His vocals here are just menacing and while his vocals are more clear here it still somehow tops the brutality of the first 2 releases. Max also stepped up his guitar playing here immensely. His song writing on this album had evolved to incredible heights not saying Schizophrenia wasn't rad because it's just a smidge behind this beast of a record. The whole band hit their stride with Beneath the Remains and delivered one of the most crushing albums of 1989. \n\nThis album starts with the title track and begins with an ominous clean chorus laced guitar that sets the atmosphere and bridges into the barrage of riffs this record contains. \"Inner Self\" is just classic a mid tempo rager about nonconformity and was a staple song in their live set at the time. \"Stronger Than Hate\" starts at a crazy fast pace with Andreas just ripping a fast lead right at the beginning the track. \"Sarcastic Existence\" and \"Lobotomy\" starts off with Igor demonstrating his skills right off the bat before kicking into the heinous onslaught of riffs this album has. I can't stress that enough this album has memorable brutal thrash riffs for days like this record has some of the most vicious and primitive riffs ever recorded. \"Slaves of Pain\" , \"Hungry\", and \"Primitive Future\" are all classic and I could go on and on about what goes down in all these tracks and how good this record is but this whole album is a must listen for anyone into any form of metal. Every single song here is just as good as the one after. Beneath the Remains never loosens its grip on you and just destroys what bands like Slayer, Dark Angel, and Kreator were doing at the time. \n\nOverall this is a straight up thrash masterpiece and my all time favorite Sepultura album. The band and members of the classic Sepultura lineup in all their projects throughout their careers have never topped this release and this is the most intense Sepultura ever got musically. This was the entire classic lineup in their prime and features their best songwriting on any of their albums. Beneath the Remains is a skull crushingly fast thrash release that still contains slower mid tempo moments and packs in a lot of atmospheric acoustic and clean guitar moments that contrast the brutality on an extremely haunting level. The amount of influential and inspiring riffs here are off the charts and this album is a must listen for anyone into heavy music. I'd highly recommend Beneath the Remains to anyone as it is one of the best thrash metal albums from the golden era of thrash back in the 80's/early 90's and in my opinion the best album to ever come out of South America as a whole. Beneath the Remains is a downright classic and your library is incomplete without it.\n",
        "\nWhy is this fantastic album never given the attention it deserves? Why isn't it talked about much? And most of all, why is it never credited as one of the first death metal albums??? I'll never know. But I myself am so glad I've always been giving the almighty Morbid Visions the attention and appreciation it truly deserves.\n\nI remember back in the day I kinda hated this album, because the guitars sounded cheap and tinny, the production on them I was confused by. That's pretty much the only reason why I disliked it a long time ago. But the more I've listened, the more I've started to love it and realize how wrong I was for disliking it and thinking it was trash. For a first timer on this album, one might react with \"what the fuck\" because of how the guitars sound, but you may eventually get over it. After all this is 1986, so it should get a little break from negative critical reception on how the guitars sound. Speaking of 1986, this was released in fucking 1986! THIS. I'd myself say this is ahead of it's time, because this is a pure, heavy, evil, bitchin' death metal album in 1986. Sepultura themselves managed to figure the genre out even before it found it's fixed sound and was properly founded.\n\nThe drums; filled with energy, power, and fury. The vocals; raspy, growly; just perfect. The guitars; awesome, raw, evil, and satisfying. The bass; present and hearable, and not overpowered by the guitars. The first track (also the title track) Morbid Visions, which is my favorite off the album, immediately shows the listener what they're about, and how raw and kickass this album is overall. Catchy fast drum beats and blasts at the beginning, fast riffs, repeated raspy growl-screams, what else is there to ask? This is incredible for 1986. The other best tracks are Mayhem, Troops of Doom, and War. The four tracks I've just mentioned are the best on the album, but every track is good; Morbid Visions is an album that's good from beginning to end.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why I love this album is the fact that this was released in 1986, and it's really heavy and brutal for an album put out at that time. The main aspect that makes it heavy are the drums. They have a super strong, solid, brutal sound to them. The snare drum and kick drum don't fuck around, neither do the toms and cymbals. The guitars, once you get used to them, are great and sound fantastic. They sound evil, run-down (in a good way), and remnant of an ongoing fire. And the riffs are on point and of quality, I adore the guitar work on this release. Max's raspy growl-shouts are a cherry on top to taste. This is definitely one of the very first death metal albums, I'd say the second \"death metal\" album after Possessed's Seven Churches. Death's Scream Bloody Gore is most definitely NOT the first death metal album, Seven Churches is, followed by Morbid Visions. Scream Bloody Gore DEFINED what death metal truly is, it didn't INVENT the genre. Scream Bloody Gore is EXTREMELY overrated, go give Morbid Visions the attention instead, which it truly deserves and needs more of.\n\nThis will always be my favorite Sepultura record, Beneath the Remains or Arise will never come close to this in my opinion. Morbid Visions is great because: #1: It's raw, brutal, and heavy. #2: An album this brutal and ahead of it's time came out in 1986. #3: It simply just has very good and catchy songs. I may also like albums like Roots and a good chunk of the Derrick Green era of Sepultura, but this album will forever be my #1 of theirs.\n\nBest Songs:\nMorbid Visions\nMayhem\nTroops of Doom\nWar\nCrucifixion\n",
        "\nPeople who have seen nothing of the world have a strong tendency to think in stereotypes. Alas, I speak from experience. When it comes to Brazil, I see a strange mix of barefoot boys playing football on the beach, big Favelas and the Sugar Loaf Mountain. Not to mention the scantily dressed young women of the famous carnival in Rio. I have heard they look very cute, but due to the fact that my liaison with the most beautiful girl of the world still is existing, I am not really interested in the female dancers in Brazil. However, dancers usually need music and some of the best music from the South-American giant comes from Sepultura. Too bad that \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d from 1993 marks the last thrilling album of the band. Afterwards the guys released more albums than good songs. The legendary semi-final of the World Cup 2014 was the justified punishment for the shit the band had released for more than two decades.\n\nBut back in 1993, the sun was still shining and everything seemed possible. \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d is a diverse, but not heterogeneous album. It\u2019s the answer to the pretty predictable \u201cArise\u201d, which was free from any experiments. Its only function was to draw back on the success formula of \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d. The result was a good album without any surprising elements. \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d is different. It has an apocalyptic touch that shimmers through the vast majority of the tracks. The sinister and wicked element ensures an homogeneous basic mood. Nevertheless, aside from this consistently dark aura, the brutal songs at the beginning (\u201cRefuse / Resist\u201d, \u201cTerritory\u201d) have not much in common with the mysterious nearly-instrumental \u201cWe Who Are Not as Others\u201d. The experimental, somehow superfluous but not annoying \u201cKaiowas\u201d has no interface with the hardcore-influenced eruption of anger called \u201cBiotech Is Godzilla\u201d. Finally, \u201cThe Hunt\u201d puts the focus on a smooth flow with pretty normal vocals, while \u201cClenched Fist\u201d sounds comparatively bulky and hysterical.\n\nThe production plays an important role with regard to the overall impression. \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d is based on a shady mix that combines the resistance of the underground with the technical opportunities of a successful metal unit. Sepultura do not exhibit their financial power by presenting a high-end sound. Their fifth work still mirrors the slums, poverty and aggression. Unlike the beauty I call my girlfriend, Max Cavalera prefers aggressive pitches. The riffs are heavy, cutting and crunchy and the drums serve the songs instead of wallowing in tribal figures. Also unlike my ever-busy beauty, the general velocity remains on a manageable level and with a little tear in my eye I realize that the days of \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d are long gone. Yet even though there is only a vague connection between the albums from 1993 and 1987, Sepultura convince with unambiguous attitude and penetrating power. No doubt, \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d shows a more courageous band than its predecessor did.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s time for some very wise words: sometimes it needs courage to go for new horizons\u2026 but hopefully one gets rewarded afterwards. In 1993, Sepultura were still flying high and it is a pity that their downfall was not long in coming. Be that as it may, the perfectly costumed girls in Brazil are probably still dancing and the girl I love is still at my side. \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d could be much worse and the same applies \u2013 I beg your pardon, Corona virus \u2013 for the whole situation.\n",
        "\nIn the early 2000's I thought there were two bands called Sepultura that even shared the same band logo. From today's perspective that sounds more than stupid, but I was only 13 years old when I saw the video clip for \"Mindwar\" and I didn't know any better at the time. I thought that each band would split up as soon as the current singer left the band. I was confused to see a Sepultura video clip with a singer other than Mr. Cavalera. Today I know the career of Sepultura, their glorious rise and so-called downfall from grace after Max Cavalera threw in the towel. \n\nIn a way, I understand the many opinions of most Sepultura fans when it comes to the Cavalera era, but I can't understand the hatred Derrick Green gets, despite being in the band almost twice as long as Max Cavalera ever was. Derrick is a great front man, although his vocals are more rooted in the hardcore scene. In my opinion, Max Cavalera was terribly overrated in his time at Sepultura as both a songwriter and a singer. I have to admit that I think that he has only developed his full potential with his band Soulfly since 1998. Yeah, I know I'll be stoned to death, but it's the truth. I'm a fan of Cavalera, but he's really better off with Soulfly.\n\nI generally had the wrong idea about Sepultura at the time I got to know them because the first album I heard was \"Roots\". Anyone familiar with Sepultura knows that \"Roots\" is not representative of their sound. I still like the album a lot, even if it lacks substance from today's perspective. I didn't have this problem with \"Roorback\". In contrast to \"Roots\", I found \"Roorback\" to be insubstantial at first, but today it is a small forgotten diamond for me. Is it their best? I don't know, but it is the Sepultura album I listened to the most. Although \"Roorback\" seems to be one of the most hated albums among Sepultura fans, including \"Against\" and \"Nation\", it is nonetheless the first album that comes closest to the original Sepultura sound at the time since \"Chaos A.D.\", although it still contains punk and hardcore influences.\n\nAs of 2003 \"Roorback\" is their strongest effort in years and their most consistent and energized album. Many fans complained about the lack of ideas, but what exactly do they mean? The topics, the riffs? What? I'd read a lot about the lack of good riffs, but I can't understand it. The riffs seem very energetic and invite you to headbang. No matter if fast and powerful like in \"Come Back Alive\", hard grooving like in \"Urge\", or wildly whirring like an annoyed swarm of bees in \"Apes of God\". Basically, \"Roorback\" has everything that makes a Sepultura album. I think the problem is the hardcore influence for many fans, the sterile production of this album could also contribute to the displeasure of many fans.\n\nAnd you can't even accuse Sepultura of stagnation. \"As It Is\" and \"Bottomed Out\" impressively show how versatile this album can be in its self-designed framework. Derrick Green's talented singing skills are particularly evident in \"As It Is\" and \"Bottomed Out\". Not only can the guy roar like a wild boar, he can also sing wonderfully without sounding gay. Always serious but melodic, he refines these two songs with his dark timbre. \n\nLet's quickly talk about drummer Igor Cavalera. Somehow I have the feeling that the guy is underrated, but right here he sounds like an octopus. I can't explain otherwise how to get the drum patterns he produces with only two arms in a row. In \"Urge\" he beats up his complete kit in the chorus in order to create an atmosphere between the verse parts that is equally addictive.\n\nI really like this album! It could be because of the time I heard it, because I was still a teenager and all kinds of things shaped me. But I still like this album a lot today and in my ears it just got better. To be honest, I can't answer if it's the best Sepultura album, but it's one of my favorite albums. It might not have been revolutionary for metal, it might even have been forgotten by many people, but for me it was groundbreaking and one of the albums that survived my taste development and still inspires me today. Thank you for your time my friend!\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not a big fan of \u201cChaos AD\u201d but I think the groove elements they tried to incorporate were still heavy somehow and even if it showed a clear intention to leave the classic thrash metal period of the band behind, it\u2019s a decent transition to the modern sound that would eventually keep the band updated with the taste of the constantly changing music business\u2019 market. \u201cRoots\u201d on the other hand, added lots of groove with the latino influenced percussion style and exotic drums but the final result is disgusting. The ethnic elements didn\u2019t mixed well with the inherently rough and tinny edge of extreme metal and eventually the band moved to a safer but still boring, more industrial and n\u00fc oriented proposal for the next releases. Almost 25 years later they release \u201cQuadra\u201d, and it feels like a revindication of those ethnic elements as the album is incredibly solid and their best output in all this time. Apart from the ethnic percussive elements there are also orchestral arrangements, female vocals and choirs\u2026\n\nWhat appears to be a new height regarding maturity in composition also enjoys the benefits from a world class production. The orchestrations are virtual instruments as you can check on the credits but you couldn\u2019t tell just by listening, some were arranged by Franceso Ferrini, the pianist from Fleshgod Apocalypse, and others done by Renato Zanuto, keyboardist for Andreas Kisser solo project; very good mix\u2026 you can trace the latin influence back to the Roman Empire in this record -it\u2019s way more than just samba metal- and the heavy and obscure parts include exquisite riffing. The drums sound acoustic and to be fair, Eloy Casagrande is a hell of a percussionist and songwriter. The use of exotic drums and the cymbals is extremely refined, and his style in general gives so much more than the tempo keeping role of a drummer in a band, it also adds a tribal atmosphere to decorate the groovy riffs and in some of the most epic parts he sounds almost medieval. The bassist Paulo Jr. just fills with simple bass lines the space between the rhythm guitars and the drums, nothing special either.\n\nThe guitars are lead instruments in the riff driven sections of the record, in which different styles of guitar playing are combined. Some fast parts sound like modern Overkill, but don\u2019t ressemble classic thrash or Sepultura at all; they still kick ass though. Andreas Kisser\u2019s trademark guitar lead sections with repetition of obscure and technical guitar licks are obviously also present, adding a haunting touch to the record. Soloing is exquisite too, technical in the large sections and pragmatic when just a floyd rose high pitched scream is needed to destroy everything in sight. Mid paced sections are super heavy, I\u2019d say that some riffs are on the edge of thrash and death metal. Some sections include classical guitars too, and when the orchestral instruments take the spotlight the rhythms are also interesting on the low end.\n\nThe album is so varied in terms of composition, there are some progressive parts with ultra weird jazzy drum patterns and outer space sounding progressive arpeggiated scales, Voivod influence perhaps. The second half of the album is more experimental, the first one is heavier but the whole spin is interesting. Vocals by Derrick Green consist on powerful screams like any metalcore vocalist, technical or tuned clean singing is done by the choirs or the female guest vocalist, adding more textures to the already theme varied album. I\u2019d say the second part of the album is even more touching than the first one, that also kicks ass. It\u2019s a very pleasant surprise for a fan of 1987-1991 Sepultura to enjoy another album released under this moniker, but any instrumentalist of any genre will surely enjoy this.\n",
        "\nSepultura made itself one of the most influential band of the early extreme metal scene with their first material like Morbid Devastation in the 80s, along with Exodus and Sodom for example. When the Black Album was released in the early 90s and Metal started to get into the mainstream, Sepultura kept releasing heavy records like Arise and Chaos A.D. The fabulous and powerful riffs, the vocal delivery of Max Calavera, it was really one of the biggest, if not THE ONE band carrying the extreme metal genre upon it\u2019s shoulder in the 90s (with Pantera maybe), kinda like Metallica with Thrash the decade before they sold themselves and became rock stars.\n\nWe are in 1996, Sepultura decided to change their sound, more focusing on the vocals and tribal percusions and furthering away from their extreme metal roots, ironically (b\u2019cause the name\u2019s Roots, you see?). As a fan of everything Sepultura did before, I knew this ablum was different, but I was not underestimating it. I heard good comments about it, already knew and liked the first song Roots Bloody Roots, so I was curious without prejudice, aside that I was expecting quality.\n\nThe first track is an absolute classic, being porwerful and aggressive, having this weird eerie guitar sound, they achieve to create a down and heavy mood without a breakdown-friendly riff, but that\u2019s why I get tired of it easily. There\u2019s isn\u2019t much else to find to this dark and heavy melody, and thus it is the main problem of this record. While the album is full of energy, how can you make heavy songs and breakdowns without powerful and badass riffs? Well they certainly tried. Attitude keeps the energy up the ceiling, having good hooks and breaks but again: while the riff isn\u2019t bad, it is extremely simple and the whole song gravitates around it. They put on a dark mood with the bassline and percussions, but this formulae will get real old real fast. \n\nCut-Throat is the closest song from the sound of their previous records, being only 2:45 long, but having 3 different riffs, a small breakdown and a small solo. Max rarely matched before the vocals I heard on this song, making worth the detour! Next on the tracklist is Ratamahatta, where Sepultura will use inspirations from world music and their Brazilian origins to make a definetly strange but really fun song, having those portuguese lyrics, tribal percussions, and a contagious groove. It is definetly a bizarre song to hear the first time you do, but all all of this results as the black sheep of the album, really a small jewel.\n\nAnnnnnd that\u2019s really it. Past the 4 first tracks, the album will still try to install a dark and heavy mood with bass and drums but it\u2019s just not interesting, with the highest boredom point not being this almost 5 minutes long acoustic track that no one cares about \u00be through the album (Itsari), but this 13 MINUTES jam at the very end containing nothing but tribal percussions and crickets (Canyon Jam). While there are some good parts like Born-Stubborn, this album is full of powerless riffs without any groove or thrashiness or real and satisfying breakdowns. You can hear the premises of the nu metal genre with those simple and boring riffs, Sepultura trying to change their sound to a more accessible/radio-friendly metal. The album didn\u2019t feel forced tho, I felt a real angriness behind this project, and it\u2019s also really possible that I missed something big about this album, maybe there is a whole artistic dimension that I didn\u2019t understood (possibly the part about being Brazilian). I would recommend this album to fans of Slipknot, Korn, System of a Down, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend those bands.\n",
        "\nSepulture has always been a staple in metal, particularly thrash metal, since their conception in the early 1980\u2019s where they were the sound of metal in Brazil and among the few who could compete with the metal scene growing \u2013 maybe even unproportionally \u2013 in the world-renowned Bay Area, with such acts as Exodus, Metallica, Testament, Death Angel, Megadeth and Blind Illusion. The original line-up of the band, with Cavalera Brothers, is still highly idolized and their work is often deemed superior to the more recent offerings of the band. I, admittedly, was one such person. Well I was until I heard this new release. I\u2019m not saying The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart and Machine Messiah were inherently weak performances, I\u2019m just saying this work is a cut above them. \n\nLet me come clean first; Sepultura is yet to be what they can be and sound as they should. After years of miscalculations and unfeasible measures, wrong decisions and missteps, they are finally pulling themselves together and taking their music to a plateau even higher than they have ever been; particularly, I have their classic thrash/death era in mind. They are not there yet, but they are up and moving toward that goal and I would say right on track. I can mention the symphonic sound they have recently infused into their music more proactively, or their departure from their nu-metal weight of past years and moving toward progressive metal as some illustrations of Sepultura trying to make amends. \n\nQuadra is a 12-piece thrash fury which keeps the listener at the edge of their seat. It is surely more than simply thrash and it aims higher than your average, albeit classy, albums within this genre. It opens with a spacy ambience (intro to Isolation) and later on becomes and remains for most parts during the course of the journey proggy, it gets acoustic (Guardians of Earth intro) and above all, here and there, symphonic (Agony of Defeat). Be not mistaken, I am not saying that these innovations and variations have all worked out. Quite contrary, they have missed the mark, by miles I would say, in some cases. But the fact that they have displayed the courage to do so, to break new grounds in their music, is respectable. One example, and maybe the major flaw with this album, is that their incorporation and execution of progressive pieces has, in the main, failed. They haven\u2019t found the wrench to put the gears on their new cogwheel well into place\u2026 YET. The pieces feel jagged and serrated and they squeak while operating. The time signatures, the tempo changes, the riffs (the ones which were supposed to be proggy) and all sound sort of out of place and need some greasing. Take Raging Void as an example. Listening to the song, one might feel that there is no chemistry between the band members; it\u2019s like the guitar is playing for himself and so do the drums. It could be even titled the weakest song on the album. But on the whole, I am positive about what they will do on the upcoming albums. \n\nOn the plus side, this album overflows with headbangable, mosh-pit-friendly riffs, all thanks to Andreas Kisser\u2019s masterclass art of guitar. Except for said Raging Void, almost all the other riffs have this aspect of forceful guitar lines. Add to this, the solos which are a sight for sore eyes (or a tune for sore ears!) whenever they appear on a song. They are clean, fast, technical and to-the-point. Kisser has established himself as a reputable guitarist throughout these years, and so has Paulo Jr. on the bass. The bass lines are not negligible at all; in fact, they are on par with guitar pieces; however, they are not easy to pick while passively listening to the music. The youngest member of the band, Eloy Casagrande, who was born years after the band had made their first release, shines dazzlingly bright behind the drumkit and demonstrates his prowess and skill. But the member whom I would pick for the top artist on this album is Derrick Green. His voice is damn strong and had it not been for some effects on his voice (such as the ones on Ali), which have actually tarnished his otherwise robust vocals, it would have been much more impactful than what it as a whole is. Also, Emmily Barreto of Far From Alaska, who provides guest vocals on Fear, Pain, Chaos, Suffering does the best she can in order not to be overpowered by Green, but she is incomparable. \n\nOne more thing which may leave the impression on the listener that it needed more diligence is the lyrics. The topics they have touched upon are similar to their recent albums: politics, addiction, social injustice, and inner struggle, as some examples. On a good handful of songs, they are thoughtful and artful at the same time (Isolation). On some others, regrettably, such as Fear, Pain, Chaos, Suffering, they seem inadequate and underwhelming. \n\nOverall, this album is a beacon of hope. This Sepultura is a band which was desired for a while and finally surfaced and this album is a turning point in their career. The symphonic sound of the album, in particular, is much to my liking and I hope they integrate it more in the albums to come. If the band manages to hone their saw-edged proggy sound and make it flow more smoothly, grander works are upon us and more glorious days upon the band. \n\nHighlights: Isolation - The Pentagram - Agony of Defeat \n\nRating: \nLyrics: 7.0\nArtwork: 8.5\nMusicianship: 8.0\nVocals: 8.5\nOverall: 8.0\n\nOriginally written for and published on www.NoobHeavy.com\n",
        "\nWhat\u2019s the deal with Brazilians and their contribution to the metal world? Looking back at the amount of bands signed to Cogumelo Records back in the 80\u2019s, it\u2019s as if the country was unstoppable for a while. Sepultura were one of those bands to get picked up by the label and it didn\u2019t take long before they\u2019d put out a series of high quality albums.\n\nWhile the cover artwork looks more frightening than that of Bestial Devastation, I can\u2019t help but think that Morbid Visions is a slightly inferior successor. Max Cavalera still sounds possessed due to his raspy growl echoing with great effects, but occasionally it\u2019s as if he runs out of a breath during the album\u2019s faster bits. I also wish Sepultura continued to use the death metal guitar tone they had discovered on Bestial Devastation instead of the guitar tone that was used here \u2013 that is a thinner buzzsaw sound more along the lines of Hellhammer. The guitars still sound out of tune here, but I\u2019ll be lying if I said that would actually bother me, as this is one of those albums were plenty of such \u2018\u2019off\u2019\u2019 aspects somehow work. Lyrically this album is quite a mess but that\u2019s to be expected of a bunch of Brazilian teenagers who\u2019d write about Lord Satan. Indeed, this is Sepultura before were all about \u2018\u2019walking these dirty streets with hate in my mind\u2019\u2019 but then again, the cover artwork should hint you\u2019re in for a hellish experience \u2013 it features a demon being that doesn\u2019t look too happy (I\u2019m not sure whether they could stare at one otherwise; I\u2019m not an expert on these things).\n\nAlthough the occasional nods to Celtic Frost have pretty much vanished here, there are still some raw edges part of Morbid Visions, preventing it from emerging like a pure thrash metal record. ''Troops of Doom'' exemplifies how far Sepultura were ahead of their time with its hidden diabolical tremolos appearing between these choppy thrash riffs, demonic roars and guitar tones crafted in hell \u2013 something the later version from 1990 unfortunately lacked. Likewise, \u2018\u2019Crucifixion\u2019\u2019 explodes into some tremolo-driven madness after that silly interlude and doesn\u2019t that one specific riff (you'll recognize it) near the end sounds like a black metal riff? I doubt that even the band had a clue about what they were exactly trying to create at this point in their career, but it's quite a shock considering the year this came out. Having that said, Morbid Visions features plenty of thrash metal-breaks and crude riffs do hint the direction Sepultura would take with Schizophrenia. \u2018\u2019Mayhem\u2019\u2019 for instance, has more death metal overtones than main characteristics, even if it's still disguised due to the harsher vocal delivery and the not-quite-thrash guitar tone. While not being masters of their instruments just yet, the band really gives it all here and not even the out of tune guitars withhold Max Cavalera and Jairo Tormentor from unleashing the winds of damnation. Just hear how \u2018\u2019War\u2019\u2019 undergoes plenty of tempo changes and just when you think it\u2019s to end, surprises you with one sudden impulsive riff that emerges itself with velocity, cranking the intensity levels up even more than that that the first three tracks on Morbid Visions are capable of.\n\nAlthough I used to consider Morbid Visions to be too one dimensional compared to Bestial Devastation, over time I\u2019ve learnt that there\u2019s more to this album than meets the eye. \u2018\u2019Show Me the Wrath\u2019\u2019 is the most melodic number on here; only so due to that built-up before relying on that violent, yet earworm kind of main riff. Sepultura would get rid of unconventional songs as time went on and part of me wonders what they had could turned into, if only they progressed as musicians while retaining their rough edges. I\u2019m also aware some introductions do feel familiar, as the aforementioned \u2018\u2019Troops of Doom\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Funeral Rites\u2019\u2019 almost start off identical, but they\u2019re otherwise quite easy to distinct. The former almost sounds like a thrash/death metal hybrid of \u2018\u2019Symptom of the Universe\u2019\u2019 and the latter appears as something foreboding before turning into yet another infernal ripper of a track. Having that said, I\u2019d argue even the two albums that followed weren\u2019t exactly the most elaborated albums from a songwriting perspective either \u2013 something that worked well on Schizophrenia but became more of a disadvantage on Beneath the Remains (hold your pitchforks, I still like that album quite a bit).\n\nThose looking for a tight thrashing experience might find Morbid Visions too much of a rough piece of work for its own good, but if you\u2019re looking for a dirtier variant of the style, this album should be up your alley. Forget about cities in ruin, tanks on the streets and tribal violence everywhere...only death is real.\n",
        "\nIts 2006 - 10 years after Max Cavalera\u2019s departure from the band \u2013 and Sepultura was still trying to reinvent itself after one of metal\u2019s most prominent frontman quitted the band. After their average releases, Against and Roorback, and the poor Nation, the band was starting to fall apart and disappear from the mainstream. They needed a new beginning, since metal magazines were already talking about how much time the group had left.\n\nAs usual, Andreas wanted to try something different: Dante XXI is entirely based on the Divine Comedy written by Dante Alighieri on the 13th century. The band respected the poem\u2019s thematic and division, writing the album in the sequence of the three books: the first part, that lasts until Fighting On, represents Inferno (book 1); the second part, from Limbo to Repeating the Horror, represents Purgatory (book 2); and the last part, from Euno\u00e9 to Still Flame, represents Paradise (book 3). The lyrics were adapted to discuss modern issues under the spirit of the poems, approaching issues like animal abuse, veganism and even nuclear power.\n\nThe instrumental work also deserves respect and appreciation, as it showed (at the time of the release) that the band still had energy and creativity to keep doing relevant music, as Convicted in Life was the first song from the Derrick Green era that drew attention from the metal community (as well as Ostia, with its violin solo). The guitar and drums showed a great technical improvement, and Andreas guitar solos resembled his earlier (and angrier) work on Beneath The Remains and Arise, as did Igor\u2019s drum work (sadly his last work with Sepultura). Paulo Xisto\u2019s bass lines made the perfect base for Andreas guitars, making the instrumental more heavy and groovy.\n\nDerrick improved his vocals as well, evolving from a high pitched scream on Against to a more low voice tone, more controlled and technical screaming. He also improved his songwriting, getting most of the credits for the lyrical content, finally assuming his position as one of the band\u2019s most important members - a position he shares with Andreas until this day.\n\nLooking back at the band\u2019s history, we can probably say that Dante XXI saved the Derrick era of Sepultura from collapsing and splitting, as the record even made them survive Igor Cavalera\u2019s departure, of which Paulo Xisto became the last founding member still playing with the group. The album is one of the bands most solid works, with songs like Convicted in Life remaining on the setlist on the bands most recent tours. It re-started the Derrick Green phase for most fans and opened for the band doors that looked permanently closed.\n",
        "\nA lot of people hasn't get over the fact that the Cavalera brothers left sepultura a long time ago: Igor 14 years ago and Max 24 years ago. Since those line-up changes, the band style has mutated a lot, merging groove, hardcore punk and elements of Brazilian music into their sound.\n\nTheir hardcore/groove/experimental phase, still with Igor, reached it's creative peak on Dante XXI. The second phase, trying to recapture their old thrash sound with their groovy riffs and their experimentalism, lasts until this day, with their new album Quadra. \n\nSince 'The Mediator', another factor has contributed to a shift towards a more extreme sound: the addition of Eloy Casagrande to the band. Though he is mostly unknown outside of brazil, Eloy is not new to the country's metal scene. He has worked with Andre Matos and Gloria in the past, and has appeared in many drumming magazines in Brazil as the 'new face' of Brazilian metal. The man is a demolition machine, and he has added groove and precision to the band's sound. And a lot of energy as well. His groovy drumming matches prefectly with Paulo Xisto's bass lines (probably because they have a lot of chemistry and camaraderie outside the studio as well).\n\nQuadra is a concept album, based on numerology, the quadrivium and the meaning of the number four. That concept is used to discuss the subdivisions made on society by economical, political, religious and social patterns. All lyrics were composed by Derrick Green, showing that the vocalist is one of the main sources of sepultura's creativity. He also delivers a breathtaking performance, balancing melodic and raw vocals throughout the record.\n\nThe concept of the album influences not only the lyrics, but the album tracking: it is divided on four sides: the thrasher side; the mid-tempo groovy side; the third side, with heavy songs mixed up progressive elements and tempo shifts; and the last side, acoustic-driven, slower and more melodic than the others.\n\nOnce again, mr. Andreas Kisser proves he is one of the most versatile guitar players on this planet. Revising his acoustic/melodic intros and sections from earlier albums (like Beneath The Remains), adding classical instruments and unusual tempo changes on his heavy riffs, Andreas shows that the loss of the Cavaleras wasn't as impactful as people having been talking over the years. He captures the ever-present spirit of curiosity and change that sepultura has, without losing track of their essence.\n\nBeing the top spot on a creativity curve that started on Kairos and went on to Machine Messiah, the new album allows the listener to enjoy all sides sepultura has shown over the years while still showing they can push the boundaries forward, even having almost four decades of career on their curriculum. Along with Dante XXI, Quadra is surely their best effort without the Cavaleras and with mr. Green on the microphone.\n",
        "\nNot unlike the bulk of iconic bands associated with the original thrash metal explosion of the 80s, Brazil\u2019s own Sepultura has experienced a career defined by soaring peaks and abyssal valleys that have left their core fan base with a nasty case of whiplash. Opinions vary regarding the efficacy of their less conventional fair in the mid-1990s up until the recent present, though there is a fairly broad consensus among their old school followers that the trajectory immediately following the release of 1993\u2019s Chaos A.D. (itself a somewhat polarizing album among thrash traditionalists), has been a downward one. Nevertheless, the band had already begun to distance themselves from the Korn-influenced grooves of Roots at the dawn of the previous decade, though they never quite managed to recapture the unrelenting fury that typified their seminal studio offerings. Then again, if their latest conceptual thrashing powerhouse of an album Quadra is any indication, the remnant of what unleashed Beneath The Remains and Arise upon the masses have yet to close the door on past glory.\n\nWhile this latest excursion into socially conscious, vertebrae-destroying mayhem doesn\u2019t culminate in a complete throwback to the apex of their early days circa 1989, it represents their closest stride into said former glory, particularly from a standpoint of raw intensity. There is a subtle yet prominent industrial character to the mode of modern thrashing at play here, drawing some similarities to the one-off project that this band\u2019s former front man Max Cavalera delved into via the short-lived experimental project Nailbomb, alongside some remnant vernacular tribal music additives and a newly adopted symphonic shtick that is somewhat reminiscent of Machine Head\u2019s early 2010s offerings, though more bombastic and with a more consistent vocal display. Truth be told, while six-string slayer Andreas Kisser steals the show with a maddened display of bone-crushing riff work and majestic shredding and drummer Eloy Casagrande makes one hell of a racket from start to finish, Derrick Green proves to be in top vocal form here, surpassing his past performances in the Sepultura fold and holding a massive torch to the Cavalera legacy in the process.\n\nPlaying off a conceptual theme of struggle against predetermined cultural boundaries, this album is an exercise in something that has often been absent from the Sepultura formula since the mid-1990s, namely stylistic unity. Most of the aforementioned peripheral elements that augment this album\u2019s thrash foundation are used to tasteful effect, while emphasis is placed upon the metallic fury and dissonant rage that goes into making an album worthy of generating a crazed circle pit. No expense is spared in the speed department, as an impressive assortment of high octane brilliance is on full display in crushers like the epic opener \u201cIsolation\u201d, the unadulterated shred fest \u201cLast Time\u201d, and the somewhat more groovy yet riff happy \u201cAli\u201d. Gone are the days of punishingly minimalistic chugs and fragmented lead drones played to oversimplified beats and incoherent shouts, as these songs cycle through an elaborate array of Bay Area-infused influences with a grandiose melodic backdrop. Even when things seem to lean into more of a groove metal stomp like on \u201cRaging Void\u201d, the specter of nu-metal buffoonery is nowhere to be found.\n\nNaturally man will tend not to live by thrash alone, particularly if he\u2019s already spent a fair amount of time doing that a few decades ago, and there are a solid array of sonic surprises to be found amid the displays of old school thrash proclivities. For those who remember the intricate foray into acoustic tribal music that was \u201cKaiowas\u201d off the Chaos A.D. album, there is some similar elements to be found on \u201cGuardians Of Earth\u201d, albeit intermingled with some epic choral sounds and functioning as a prelude to what becomes a melodic groove-thrashing extravaganza. The entire band ends up showcasing their technical chops and turning it into a cohesive, accessible musical journey on the entirely instrumental thrashing excursion \u201cThe Pentagram\u201d, and this normally hard as nails outfit takes some time to explore their softer side on \u201cAgony Of Defeat\u201d, meshing in some introductory balladry and winding up in musical territory that merges the mystical musings of Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u201cKashmir\u201d with the chunky, metallic fury of this band\u2019s signature style.\n\nIn the grand scheme of this band\u2019s extensive career, which has now come to span 14 full length studio albums, Quadra is the greatest thing to come down the pike since they first began to transition away from their early thrash roots circa 1993. It presents an interesting road not travelled scenario where the atmospheric quirks and nuances of Chaos A.D. are introduced in a more gradual way, maintaining the Bay Area-inspired energy and virtuoso guitar work that was still on full display on 1991\u2019s Arise. As a de facto comeback album, it presents a more complete return to form than the widely hailed recent outing of Metallica Hard Wired\u2026To Self-Destruct, and it manages to provide a more potent and cohesive version of the middle ground between modernity and traditional thrash that Machine Head was going for in the early 2010s, not to mention a more energetic one. It doesn\u2019t quite surpass the seminal brilliance that this band\u2019s elder fans remember from the 1980s, but it\u2019s definitely the most worthy thing to come along since.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nAlthough Arise certainly began to incorporate more groove elements, it was here that Sepultura fully fleshed out its tribal influences. While Roots would keep the tribal drumming and traditional Brazilian instruments, it would eschew thrash (for the most part, possibly with the exceptions of the hardcore-tinged \"Dictatorshit\" and \"Attitude\"), and become a key album in the transition from groove to full on nu-metal. However, on this album, a combination of mid-paced thrash and groove with dissonant Latin melodies and tribal instruments creates a work that Sepultura should see as a second high-point, like a brilliant mid-afternoon sun, in their career.\n\nWhile Beneath the Remains and Schizophrenia are my favorites, I confess that I enjoy this album more than Arise because this album definitely showcases a new direction and exciting sound for the band, whereas Arise, besides the masterful opening three tracks, can sometimes feel like Beneath the Remains 2: Electric Meaningless Movements Being Moved Through (see what I did there?), except at 70-80% speed. In contrast, Chaos AD very much stands up as a diverse musical work.While some may dismiss this as just groove metal, there are many legit thrash moments to be had, whether during the solo on Refuse/Resist, the main verse of Slave New World, the first half of Propaganda, and the end of \"Nomad\". On this album, we begin to see a stronger punk influence; examples include the New Model Army cover \"The Hunt,\" and the hardcore-flavored \"Manifest\" and \"Biotech is Godzilla.\" Then, there are also the grooving, somewhat ambient tracks \"We Who Are Not As Others\" and \"Clenched Fist,\" which add to the protest message of the album. Up until this point, Sepultura's instrumental tracks had been actually thrash (\"Inquisition Symphony\") or classically influenced (\"The Abyss\"), but now, we have the wonderful Brazilian flair of \"Kaiowas,\" a tribute to the people who committed mass suicide in protest of land incursions. In a turn of poetic justice (or irony, depending on your view of the culpability of ancestors vs. descendants, and of Europeans as a whole), Sepultura recorded it in a Welsh castle, obviously no longer inhabited by the European nobles that once lived there.\n\nObviously, all of these elements contribute to the strength, diversity, and cohesiveness of the album as a whole, but the album hangs its hat on the three singles: \"Refuse/Resist\", \"Territory\", and \"Slave New World\", along with the similarly hard-grooving \"Amen\", and \"Propaganda.\" The rhythms on these songs are infectious, the vocals are vicious and righteously irate, the lyrics are catchy and easy to shout along to, and most importantly, they make me want to riot! In terms of message, this is something that both your average metalhead and a political activist can relate to, something that cannot be said about all of Sepultura's previous works. Indeed, this feels like the type of work that, if it had a greater influence, could be inducted into something like the National Recording Registry as a piece of protest music, in a similar vein to Master of Puppets or something by Joan Baez or Bob Dylan. Some might view this cynically, but I think it only adds to the gravity of the album.\n\nOne thing that has set Sepultura apart ever since Andreas Kisser joined the band was his keen feeling for when to use the major scale to create a sense of uneasiness and tension. This is present on Schizophrenia and Beneath the Remains, but often forgotten due to the sheer speed of the solos on there. Here, the solos are much simpler for the most part, often featuring variations on the same melody rather than reinventing the wheel every bar. Consequently, this use of major and/or atonal notes stands out more on this album, and gives Sepultura its iconic, distinct sound. Many bands feel compelled to use pentatonic, minor, or chromatic all the time, but never dare to use major, and this is one of the places where early/mid Sepultura gets the upper hand.\n\nHere, Sepultura keeps the slowed down rhythms of Arise while removing the staleness and rehashed themes of death and nihilism from that record, replacing it with a message that one can be in control of one's own destiny if they just have the balls to stand up for themselves. At the same time, this album has a rhythmic complexity and songwriting nuance that is not necessarily lost on Roots, but is definitely simplified. For these reasons, I feel like Chaos A.D. represents Sepultura at a peak in their creativity. While it's not their best album in my eyes, it's definitely their most innovative, given that Roots was a much less drastic change from this than Chaos A.D. was from Arise. While Beneath the Remains showed that Sepultura could show up pretty much all of its thrash compatriots in speed, ferocity, and technique, Chaos A.D. demonstrated that Sepultura didn't have to just be a heavier, faster, more progressive Slayer or Kreator; it could in fact create something entirely new. For these reasons (along with the kick-ass music itself), I will always love this album, and it will always be an album I will point to as one of the best of groove metal. Maybe part of me wishes that Sepultura had become a full-on death metal band (I consider Morbid Visions/Bestial Devastation more black metal), but something tells me that this album is probably better than what would have resulted if Sepultura had moved in that direction.\n\nIn terms of weaknesses, this album has a few: the relatively bland \"The Hunt\", which I would remove from the album, the cheesiness of the samples in \"Biotech is Godzilla\", and the slightly more monotonous nature of \"Manifest\" and \"Clenched Fist\" in comparison to the rest of the album. That said, I would change nothing about the first six tracks, and I feel \"Nomad\" and \"We Who Are Not As Others\" are very strong as well. The fact that there are four songs I criticized might mean to some that this album deserves something more like a 90, but to me, the first six tracks are so strong, that if this pace had been continued throughout the whole album, I would probably give it a 99. And it's not like these four songs are bad; \"Biotech\" is still a banger, and the other three are just a little less memorable than the rest. I tend to reward albums for what they do well to a greater extent than I penalize them for what they do badly. Chaos A.D. is an album that will always be hated by many because it is a change in direction, which many fans never like, but I happen to think this was a change for the better from Arise, and it's a fantastic album in its own right.\n",
        "\nAs with any band that hails back to the primordial days of thrash, Sepultura has seen their fair share of ups and downs, with most of the latter being typically tied to a stylistic pivot during the sonic wasteland period of the mid-1990s. However, this longstanding Brazilian institution of death thrashing mayhem found themselves being dogged by an ongoing identity crisis following their nu-metal experiment gone awry Roots, one that consumed their generally prolific output throughout the 2000s. However, greener pastures began coming into view during the recently concluded 2010s, as their groove-obsessed rut started to give way to a swifter, albeit still modern sounding thrash assault. Nevertheless, nothing emerged that quite matched the qualitative splendor of their seminal 80s offerings, but the newly born 2020s may well see these elder statesmen regaining their perfect vision if their most recent promotional output is any indication.\n\nThe continual shouts among old school fans for a reunion with the Cavaleras not withstanding, Isolation is the sort of song that one would have come to expect from such a reunion, apart from an unrealistic expectation of a full-on throwback to the Beneath The Remains days with Scott Burns coming out of the retirement to handle the engineering. Despite being often dismissed as the interloper who never managed to full gel with the band, Derrick Green's throaty growls have been growing more and more similar to Max Cavalera's classic shout with each passing album, and here one might have assumed that he was brought in for a guest vocal slot were there not a music video out there debunking such suspicions. Likewise, one-time Andre Matos drummer Eloy Casagrande showcases a degree of youthful exuberance and ferocity that pushes the envelope well beyond the tearing point, arguably matching the raw intensity that Igor Cavalera originally brought to the good old days of primeval death thrash.\n\nAs with any thrash metal excursion, the true acid test of a new classic is the guitar work, and this is truly where things come together. Accompanied by all the aforementioned brilliance and a cinematic overture of sorts with a massive war drum and synthesizer intro, not to mention a massive choir thrown in to make things even more massive, Andreas Kisser just dominates at every turn. The guitar solo segment provided is among the more brilliant marriages of technical shred wizardry and melodic nuance, all the while maintaining that sort of jagged, modernized wail that is along similar lines to Pantera's better moments. But even more thrilling than the technical mastery on display is the highly memorable riff work, essentially taking the high octane approach that Robb Flynn has been trying to replicate from the early Vio-Lence days of late and distilling it down to something far more memorable.\n\nIt's natural to feel a bit of skepticism at the current buzz that Sepultura is on the cusp of recapturing the same spirit that birthed Arise, especially considering that nearly 30 years has passed since that album arguably put Sepultura on the world thrash metal map. Nevertheless, if this song is any indication as to how Quadra will sound as a collective whole, that would be a pretty accurate assessment. It's not identical to the vintage early 90s thrash sound in question, but it matches the degree of poise and intensity right down to the last note. With a growing number of older acts from the likes of Nocturnus A.D. and Possessed reasserting themselves of late, it's looking a lot like 2020 will be another year of the veterans giving the younger generation of metal mainstays a run for their money.\n",
        "\nPursuing my little trip in Brazilian extreme metal reviews, anyone who got into thrash metal discovered Sepultura as one of their first bands outside Metallica, Megadeth or Slayer. Mostly known for having one of the worst musical evolution in their history, the band went down to shit pretty quickly in the mid 90s and every original members leaving the group did not help either. Anyway, most people know the band mainly because of albums such as \"Arise\" or \"Beneath the Remains\". I do like those albums too, but if we go back in the very beginning of Sepultura's existence, we have primitive death/thrash metal that sound way more brutal than those latter albums. They have released their first EP called \"Bestial Devastation\" back in 1985 on the Brazilian extreme metal label Cogumelo Records. With much surprise, that record had a decent sound quality and was aggressive as hell, they of course took inspiration from the German thrash metal scene at the time and Hellhammer/Celtic Frost. That release pushed these guys to go with the extreme attitude even further on their first full-length album, which is the album reviewed here.\n\nReleased in late 1986, the first Sepultura album called \"Morbid Visions\" has never been a much popular album to their audience over the years. Like it did for Sodom's \"Obsessed By Cruelty\", I heard a lot of people claiming that the sound was too dirty or not listenable. At some point when I was younger, I thought the same thing actually, but after getting your ears used to the black metal sound, that record sounds beautiful. The primitive feel is what is making the charm of this album, every instruments (except the bass of course) sounds like they are fighting each others to see who does the loudest noise. The guitars tone is the classic, but great buzz saw that you can hear in many other underground extreme metal albums. The drums of Igor Cavalera are devastating and includes nice fills and techniques, even if these guys were still young, the tempo is followed decently. The vocals of Max Cavalera here is what should be considered as the typical death/thrash vocal tone, unlike the thrashier approach took in the subsequent albums. Although \"Morbid Visions\" has not even 35 minutes of play time, the speed at which they play is quite notable for 1986.\n\nOriginally kicking off with an introduction that got removed, the self-titled song \"Morbid Visions\" is pretty much what you should expect the entire album to sound like. It's straightforward, and it doesn't really allow us to breathe much, despite the presence of some cool rhythm changing riffs. At this point, the guys of Sepultura were not musical genius, thus the album containing mostly simple guitar riffs. However, they knew how to create a dark and sinister atmosphere with introduction riffs like in \"Funeral Rites\" or the classic \"Troops of Doom\", which the original version is on that album. While the track \"Mayhem\" fits perfectly its name with how fast and brutal it is, the more structure varied \"War\" has the most interesting parts technically speaking. Through the 80s, the band never ceased to progress on that side, which can obviously be noticed on each albums. For the vocals though, we can see how furious and evil that it sounds on tracks like \"Empire of the Damned\" and \"Crucifixion\". Max Cavalera unleash those intense hellish screams that fits the mood of the music flawlessly.\n\nYou might notice that there are few guitar solos on this album as well, and those solos like heard in \"Show Me the Wrath\" for instance, are kind of messy, but at least fits within the music. On the lyrical content, \"Morbid Visions\" is basically the same Satan related topics as many other bands did at the time. Nothing really special there, except the funny aspect that the lyrics are translated from Portuguese to English, thus the presence of mistakes. Overall, to be quite honest, this album is really good, but can get tiresome to listen to if played too many times as the material is not that memorable, even if it's still great. Of course, if you like primitive old school extreme metal, you will dig this album as much as I did, and it also allow to discover the evil past of Sepultura. It's definitely a record that I recommend giving some play through, as it may take some times to grow on you. That is what happened in my case, and I do not regret it as I even prefer this stuff over the other classics of their discography.\n\nFavorite tracks: \n\nCrucifixion\nEmpire of the Damned\nMorbid Visions\nTroops of Doom\n",
        "\nFor many, Chaos A.D. marks the beginning of the end for Sepultura - this highly divisive album is seen as their fall from grace and their first step into the pits they inhabit today. While sonically it did pave the way for the slop the band would put out after it, the transition made here is a successful one. On this album, Sepultura underwent a fairly drastic shift in sound to groove metal - obvious comparisons to Pantera can be made, with the riffs here being much simpler than on previous efforts. The band relies on texture, directness, percussive heaviness and simplicity for impact as opposed to an assault on the senses through speed and technicality. Max's vocals always tended more towards shouting than growling but here he sounds higher pitched, a bit more monotone, consistently louder and more angry sounding. The soloing and drumming meanwhile is in fact more active and technical than on past efforts - in a similar fashion to Pantera the reduced technicality of the riffs means the soloing and drumming has been spiced up to provide more variation to the songs. \n\nHowever, the feel of this album certainly isn't merely that of a Pantera clone, as there is a distinct punk spirit running throughout the album, which manifests mainly in the focus of the music. The various songs here are much more stripped down in presentation than even something like 'Walk', with a lot more focus going towards big and simple messages and motifs within the songs, with anything else taking a back seat. The soloing for instance has been stripped of most of its melody, and as such they exist solely to serve the song by being a point of contrast within them for some variation. While there are a good few riffs in any given track of varying types, they are the principle motifs of the songs and exist to be as memorable as possible, with the band stripping them down to the bare minimum to make them and thus the songs as immediate and high-impact as possible. The drums exist to accentuate those riffs and give them impact by doubling up their percussive nature. The songs are built around verse-chorus song structures with very catchy, simple choruses usually consisting of just a few words, as well as simpler verses. The vocals are more straightforward too - they are there simply to relay the lyrics and as such are stripped of what little tonal variation they had. Everything exists solely to turn each song into an engaging and memorable vehicle for the band's anger and their messages - it's all been stripped down to the bare essentials.\n\nMusic this focused and stripped down requires a great deal of passion and creativity to get by, in a similar fashion to punk and alternative rock, and it is here where the band succeeds. They have a knack for making things stick by picking only the most memorable riffs to put in a song, as well as penning the most memorable lyrics (this album's lyrics are full of earworms and quotables - this review's title being one example.) The solos, while noisy, atonal and technical, never go overboard and start noodling or otherwise detracting from the focus of the songs. The drums are hit hard, and despite the simple nature of the music the drum performance is loaded with lots and lots of interesting fills (often influenced by tribal music) to back the riffs up. The guitars sound heavy, textured and thick, and the riffs are played with a great deal of conviction. The vocals too sound righteously angry, with Max making for a convincing, truly captivating frontman. It sounds as if he put his heart into the messages he is shouting forth which makes it much easier to take them seriously, and the general passion of the performances all around results in songs that feel very crucial, as if the band have to get their sounds out there. The band also does well to mix it up in songs too, with very few tracks ever stagnating on one idea for too long. There's always a faster thrash/hardcore influenced section, breakdown, solo or some other contrasting section around the corner, with each part consistently bringing its own memorable ideas to the table (a riff, a set of lyrics, a drum pattern or another idea entirely.) For all the deliberate stripping down Sepultura's music has undergone, most of these tracks are as energetic and dynamic as before and due to their simplicity have a much more immediate impact on the listener as the band waste no time in getting to the meat of a song's ideas and messages.\n\nThe album mostly remains within the realm of hardcore/groove/thrash, with some songs leaning more towards one or two of the three. The opener, title track and most famous song here 'Refuse/Resist' is a perfect mission statement for the album as a whole. The song drips with a rebellious, angered spirit that translates into how furious and strong the performances are, with its mid-tempo verses and undeniable hook backed up by a set of fantastic groove riffs, before the band break into a speedy bridge as Andreas solos away like there's no tomorrow. Tracks like 'Territory', 'Nomad' or 'Amen' go for more mid-tempo, crushing grooves while 'Biotech is Godzilla' is excellent and to-the-point crossover thrash song and tracks such as 'Propaganda' and 'Manifest' mix up faster and more mid-tempo sections. 'We Who Are Not As Others' in an interesting, mostly instrumental, piece that continuously builds up from a slow groove riff to the climax of the band shouting the title, with an increasingly frantic drum performance, strings and leads accenting the song nicely. The New Model Army cover is a successful translation of the song to the album's style, creating a rather dark track that thematically fits in quite well and provides some variety to the album. Another interesting track is 'Kaiowas' - an acoustic jam with pounding tribal percussion that functions as a protest song of sorts, one that fits in perfectly with everything else here in spirit if not in style.\n\nWhatever it may have represented for the band and metal as a whole, Chaos A.D. will remain as a truly remarkable milestone and one of the genre's crown jewels for years to come. It's an extremely creative, potent and cohesive blend of aggression, memorability and passion, one that remains virtually unrivalled in metal to this day. It's not for everybody, but giving it a chance and allowing it to grow on you might just turn out to be very rewarding.\n",
        "\nIn a way the pre-Andreas Kisser era of Sepultura reminds me of what Hellhammer was compared to Celtic Frost \u2013 meaning we\u2019re dealing with a band that tried to sound as dark and heavy as possible and ended up influencing plenty of extreme metal bands to come.\n\nBestial Devastation has what I like to call that blasphemous Brazilian thing going on - if \u2018\u2019Antichrist\u2019\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound like the inspiration source for all those blasphemous goat worshipping black/death metal bands that appeared years later, then I don\u2019t know what does. With those grinding riffs and blastbeats banging against each other it\u2019s certainly ahead of its time. What\u2019s interesting is how certain mid paced moments on this EP seem quite Celtic Frost inspired which you couldn\u2019t say about Sepultura\u2019s later works. \u2018\u2019Necromancer\u2019\u2019 is easily the most groove-y track the band had written in the 80\u2019s and relies on a huge behemoth of a main riff before the track speeds the hell up. \u2018\u2019Warriors of Death\u2019\u2019 falls somewhere between Possessed and Celtic Frost where Max has no chorus to fall back on while the title track demonstrates a young Max barking at his frenzied that even the slower sections end up sounding like total mayhem.\n\nWhat strikes me as odd is how Bestial Devastation sounds somewhat superior to its successor. Morbid Visions had a buzzsaw guitar tone not unlike Hellhammer, but here the guitars sound downright heavy and dare I say death metal-like. I know the guitars aren\u2019t exactly in tune here, but to me that\u2019s more of an unintended strength than anything else. By the time you hear that melodic solo in \u2018\u2019Warriors of Death\u2019\u2019, it\u2019s clear even the prettiest sounds on Bestial Devastation come off more morbid and messed up than what one expect. The vocals too, are quite something. This is before Max developed that one dimensional shout or sounded like a pissed off bushman like he did on Schizophrenia. Here he roars like a demonic being with great effect; the amount of reverb on his voice really helps and unlike Morbid Visions he doesn\u2019t sound rushed but more grounded instead.\n\nSo yes, Bestial Devastation is a great EP. That goofy growled introduction is quite something and the cover artwork reminds me of that final battle of Yoshi's Island (the SNES game if anyone wonders), but otherwise this is some serious great evil stuff of a once great band.\n",
        "\nDante reckoned the lowest level of Hell is for betrayers, likely because Arch Enemy fans didn't exist back then. If he's right, I think I'm being pretty bold with this confession. Sepultura was among the many bands foolish enough to open the Pandora's box of nu-metal flatulence in the mid-90's, dumbing down their surgical thrash savagery until all the bald guys with \"\u9e21\u86cb\u9762\" tattooed on their biceps could enjoy it. Starting with Roots, it felt like every subsequent album was somehow getting worse and worse. That is until Dante XXI gave this unlikely formula a solid endgame.\n\nA pivotal moment in Sepultura's career, Dante XXI paved the way for more focused, introspective aspirations. It almost feels like a series of New Year's resolutions for Sepultura. In between sips of alcoholic egg nog, they vowed to ditch the preachy Captain Planet politics, not to mention most of the slow, atonal chugging that made Roorback as interesting as an actual history lesson on the presidency of James K. Polk. And against all reasonable expectation, Dante XXI manages to uphold these resolutions. From start to finish, this album feels vigorous, engrossing, and, for the first time since Chaos A.D., organic.\n\nThe slurry of atmospheric, quasi-tribal tracks hardly detract from the cold, venomous, down-to-earth riffs and Igor's awakened drumwork in 'Convicted in Life'. 'City of Dis' breathes new life into the utilitarian trappings of groove and hardcore, where riffs thresh and writhe like ensnared animals, and set the stage for a warped, unpredictable countenance not unlike Sodom's 2006 self-titled return to form. But, I suppose I should've said this a while back: Dante XXI is not a return to form for Sepultura. It's not even a 'modern reimagining'. As happy as I am to extol the virtues of this album, there's one slight hitch.\n\nSo hey Derrick Green, what's happening. For many, post-Max Sepultura is dead on arrival thanks to Green, and to be honest, I feel bad about that. Watch some Green interviews, and you'll understand how he was influenced by legendary crossover and punk vocalists, and had the reasonable idea to explore similar avenues with Sepultura. And you'll also understand that his normal speaking voice is far more intimidating than his screams. Behind the mic, he's an unreasonably angry goat bleating about how dry its hay is. This is in no way helped by the deluge of unnecessary vocal effects, sadly in keeping with the trope of over-produced metal in the mid-00's. Derrick remains in the exact same register throughout entire songs, and frankly the entire album. HR, Derrick Greene is not.\n\nBut if you condition yourself to overlook this shortcoming like I have, Dante XXI proves to be a pleasant bludgeoning from start to finish, and a trebuchet-launch in the right direction for the maligned band. Sorry folks; I get consistent enjoyment out of Dante XXI's primitive sawmill riffing, even if it means a prolonged, shameful conversation in an extreme metal confessional booth afterwards.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m almost positive that if a thrash metal album has more than 25 reviews, at least a few of them should be negative, so this is the antidote to all the people who think Sepultura was great on Beneath the Remains and begin sucking not long after. It should be remembered throughout that I do think this is a pretty good album, but that there are some major flaws in the thinking that it could possibly be worthy of 100% or rank among the best albums in our genre.\n\nFirst up, and this is the biggie for me, is creativity. Sure, thrash is not supposed to be a subgenre where experimentation or eclecticism is to be rewarded, but how Sepultura made their name on this and not the more diverse Schizophrenia is slightly beyond me. (Well, actually, it's because of the label, but you know.) All of the songs across 42 minutes cover similar ground with similar degrees of effectiveness and \u2013 though there are some atmospheric intros and interludes thrown in to make sure this doesn\u2019t become totally monotonous \u2013 the Brazilians just didn\u2019t have enough great ideas to make it work all the way through. There are some superb riffs, but there are also some really dud ones too and these are the places where Max Cavalera and Andreas Kisser should have changed the formula. Take \u2018Stronger than Hate\u2019 for example: the first riff is super simple but kind of hooky, after which the band go off on more of a death thrash bent, scrambling the guitars over with a semi-blast from Igor Cavelera on drums, which takes in a decent melody as it ends; however, the horrible chug that begins at 3:05 is exactly what I\u2019m talking about, going absolutely nowhere and even returning more than once afterwards. There are too many filler riffs in several of the songs to make the experience anything like as consistently destructive as many claim.\n\nAnother problem that compounds the mixed quality of the riffing is the production, which is pretty dry on the rhythm guitars and a little clattery from the drums (I\u2019m reviewing Roadrunner\u2019s remastered edition from 1998), meaning that the power of the riffs is sometimes questionable, though a product of its time, and the boring ones are emphasized all the more from having no momentum. Scott Burns was a great guy for Florida death metal, but didn\u2019t do the Seps many favours here. This issue is largely solved during guitar leads and in the clean sections that showcase more of the bass, yet the bass solo that ends \u2018Stronger than Hate\u2019 at 5:31 is slapped carelessly onto the end of the song and appears horribly out of touch with the rest of the experience. It may not be the band\u2019s fault, but it certainly spoils the listen. If I\u2019m allowed one final piss on the riffs, too much downpicking (the band\u2019s main playing technique) results in quite a lot of similar rhythms in the guitar playing, which this time creates the problem of a great similarity between parts of songs, though admittedly not of songs as a whole.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like Max Cavalera himself and becoming repetitive, there is a large niggle with samey vocals as well. In all honesty, I\u2019m not the strictest policeman of vocals in thrash, because there aren\u2019t that many bands where the vocalist can do much more than keep pace with the band, choose suitable subjects, and occasionally drop a quick surprise, as with Tom Araya\u2019s screams. Old Camouflage Max certainly doesn\u2019t attempt to inject much drama into his vocals, opting for a low-pitched approach with the same kind of gruffness and approximate pronunciation as early Sodom, which is all very correct for lyrics about \u201cCities in ruins, bodies packed on minefields\u201d, though doesn\u2019t make for a terribly interesting experience, especially given that he often \u2013 unaccountably \u2013 sings over the better riffs and leaves the boring palm-muted chugs blank.\n\nAndreas Kisser, playing lead guitar, benefits from giving songs the most definition and tossing out some nicely crazed solos, but also trips up by playing very similar \u201cintro melodies\u201d in most of the songs, all of which are based on the same technique. These appear at the beginning of \u2018Hunger\u2019, 2:16 in \u2018Mass Hypnosis\u2019, 1:38 in \u2018Lobotomy\u2019, 1:23 of \u2018Slaves of Pain\u2019, 1:28 in \u2018Primitive Future\u2019, 0:38 in \u2018Stronger than Hate\u2019, 1:49 in \u2018Inner Self\u2019, 1:18 of \u2018Sarcastic Existence\u2019, and there\u2019s even a non-melodic version after the solo on the title track. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think that\u2019s one in every song\u2026lame, wouldn\u2019t you say? So even the lead guitar is pretty monotonous too.\n\nThat seems like an awful lot of problems for one album to contend with and there is indeed a part of me that wants to say that Beneath the Remains plain sucks, but actually it's still quite good. The reason for that is Sepultura more or less perfected the formula for non-melodic thrash on the title track to this album and then repeated it too many times with too little variation and minor grumbles about the vocals and production. As such, it's hardly surprising that some thrash fans worship at the altar of early Sepultura, though it's not really the kind of thing we should be telling our children about if the band couldn't flesh out an album to its full potential. For my part, I think this is a great deal of fun and maybe the quantitative best of Sepultura's career, though I wouldn't even put it in my top 10 or 20 thrash releases. Truth be told, it gets a little bit boring before it reaches its conclusion and that's certainly not a good thing.\n",
        "\nPeople have dismissed this classic album for it's sloppy performance and poor production, but I believe that's what gives it so much character. It sounds like a few angry, repressed youth playing extreme metal, pretty impressive for their age. \n\nIgor's drumming on here isn't nearly as tight as it would become on later releases such as \"Beneath The Remains\". It is particularly sloppy and almost dragging the faster songs like \"Mayhem\". The guitar solos are pretty decent and add to the wickedly intense and evil vibe that oozes from this album. But Jairo is no Andreas Kisser for sure. Max's vocals here are unlike anything you've ever heard from him on the post-Schizophrenia releases. He does demonic growls that make him sound possessed, as his nickname for this album suggests. Paulo on the other hand has never usually done anything notable in his bass playing for Sepultura and this album is no exception. The bass is not even all that audible or present in the mix.\n\nAs for production, I think it can be excused. If people can dig \"Under A Funeral Moon\" and \"Filosofem\", then what's wrong with the sound here? Isn't black metal supposed to sound bad? This is also one of the earliest blackened death metal albums ever made, from Brazil no less, and at the time no one really knew how to produce such an insane, busy sound. So give it a break, the songwriting should count more than the production.\n\nThe songwriting here is pretty solid for the most part. Some tracks are really good. The opening title track has sick and twisted riffs that give you a taste of what this album has to offer. \"Troops of Doom\" became a live staple in Sepultura's setlist for years. \"War\", \"Show Me The Wrath\" and \"Funeral Rites\" are other noteworthy tracks that get regular play from me. \n\nThe lyrics have also received some ridicule, and some of the lyrics here are admittedly cheesy and amateur. But English was not their first language and they learned English from Black Sabbath lyrics, and that is pretty badass! So I'd give those a pass too, plus it's death metal, how seriously are you really going to take the lyrics? \n\nI would not say that it's anywhere close to being Sepultura's finest, but I think a lot of people are being harsh on this one. It was very influential and ahead of its time. It deserves some respect, even if you don't really like it.\n",
        "\nSometimes reasonably decent things can arise in spite of springing from a pretentious root. This is not a reference to the pretentious tough-guy nonsense that the subject of this excursion, Sepultura, became known for from the mid-90s up until the turn of the last decade, but rather the source material for the libretto of this groove-thrashing opera of an album with a title far too long to reference in its entirety. Appeals to the irrational and sentimental were all the rage in the first half of the 20th century, which should clue the critical observer in on why so many people died so violently during said time period, but even among left-wing idealists like H.G. Wells and a slew of film critics of the day, the overlong epic Teutonic and dystopian chunk of cinema Metropolis was received with jeers rather than cheers. Indeed, despite the brazen communist themes steeped upon it, the film in question became a favorite propaganda piece of the Nazis, was given a glowing review by Goebbels himself, and even saw the author of the screenplay avidly support the rule of said persons. But time can cure many things, including the principles of present day film critics and politically oriented bands like Brazil's favorite groove/thrash sons, thus stands a renewed interest in the Metropolis phenomenon and an album with 14 syllables in its title inspired by it.\n\nBe all this as it may, The Mediator presents a curious musical prospect amid its philosophically confused message, namely a band that has begun to rediscover the meaning of thrash metal, albeit in a highly modern and industrial context. The mixture of stylistic influences is still tilted in favor of a groovy, screamer-centered mode of heaviness in line with Pantera and Machine Head, and coupled with a healthy degree of tribal percussion additives and jazzy beats, but the potency of these elements is far more elevated and accompanied by a greater degree of speed and technical prowess. Guitarist Andreas Kisser, who had been largely relegated to stagnant minimalism on either the low or high end of his instrument's range, has now come to a more dynamic place where his competency as a melodic soloist and a shredder is given more sunlight, spearheaded by a series of wild solo sections on songs such as the harmonized shred-fest on \"The Vatican\", itself a partial retread of Sepultura's early death thrashing influences interpreted through a quasi-symphonic, modernized lens. Similarly auspicious episodes of guitar wizardry occur on the mid-paced \"Impending Doom\" and the high octane thrasher \"Tsunami\" that conjure up pictures of Alex Skolnick's masterful melodic flurries and Dimebag Darrell's noise-driven mayhem.\n\nThough the greater technical emphasis is a jarring change of pace from the plodding of yesteryear, the greater degree of focus in songwriting proves to be the most welcome change. Where just a few years ago it was near impossible to get a straight for the jugular thrasher out of this band, several are presented in all their Slayer meets Exhorder fashion in \"Trauma Of War\" and \"Obsessed\", hitting levels of power not seen since prior to Chaos A.D. at times, and vocalist Derrick Green's Anselmo-inspired hardcore roars function quite well in this capacity. Likewise, more modernized and bottom heavy fair like \"The Bliss Of Ignorants\" and \"Manipulation Of Tragedy\" lean a bit more towards a Cavalera Conspiracy sound, yet prove to be a solid step up from the meandering and directionless songwriting that has plagued this band for more than a decade. It's not a perfect departure as there are times where things get a bit bogged down, particularly when going into mid-tempo land, with this album's lone bombs being the plodding \"The Age Of The Atheist\", which ventures a bit too close to Roots territory despite being a bit busier, and a quasi-rapping hardcore-steeped cover song \"Da Lama Ao Caos\" that gets even closer to the aforementioned 1996 nu-metal abortion and comes off as more comical than dystopian.\n\nOverall, the musical picture here is a bit brighter than before and a pretty clear signal to better things on the horizon, even if the album's message is a bit reaching and conspiratorial. Andreas was probably not fully aware of the history behind the film that got his creative juices flowing for this effort, and irregardless, the album's message itself presents the opposite scenario of men being made into automatons rather than the other way around, a concept that would be given even more attention a few years later on Machine Messiah. It is mired in some baggage from the last couple albums, but it is a clear shift in direction that all but mirrors the one that was underway a year prior with Soulfly and with Machine Head yet another year before that. That's perhaps the one Persian flaw that has continued to haunt Sepultura even going back to their early days in the mid 80s when they were at the top of their game; they seem to be locked into the habit of following the latest trend that has dragged off a number of their original contemporaries. Still, the modern groove/thrash trend of late has proven superior to the ones of the 2000s and before, and so too has Sepultura's output in light of this.\n",
        "\nTo some, the concept of a cyborg, android, or other variants of the automaton present themselves as a mockery of the original, a sort of cheap imitation that conjures up images of humanity delegating its own responsibilities out of sloth or covetousness. This viewpoint is, to a great extent, analogous to the way that traditional fans of thrash metal and its death-tinged cousin view the groovier, simplified variation of the original that cropped up in the mid-90s thanks to the efforts of Machine Head, Pantera, and former Brazilian death/thrashing powerhouse Sepultura. In the case of the latter band, they were arguably the linchpin in ushering in one of metal's most loathed bastard creations not long after their controversial 1993 offering Chaos A.D.. The road since the vernacular metal abortion Roots and the exodus of vocalist Max Cavalera for Sepultura has been a very slow one, as they'd seemed just about as wont as their former front man's project Soulfly to cleave to the vapid nu-metal craze long after Limp Bizkit turned it into a bigger joke than it was to begin with, but it has seen some progress in recent years, culminating in what is arguably their finest studio offering as a band since Arise.\n\nTo state the obvious, Machine Messiah is not a return to the death/thrashing glory days of pre-1992, but rather a more refined and intricate take on the groove/thrash style that Max Cavalera opted to take up with his brother in their project Cavalera Conspiracy and also the last few Soulfly efforts. It takes a number of the stronger elements of what was attempted on Chaos A.D. and mixes in a sizable assortment of progressive, tribal and even some doom elements to create a far more varied array of songs that rival the surprisingly strong Machine Head 2011 effort Unto The Locust. Alongside a busy collection of heavy riff work and thundering drums is an unusually high concentration of orchestrated and keyboard sounds, particularly on prog-leaning excursions like the instrumental \"Iceberg Dances\" and the driving thrasher \"Sworn Oath\", all the while systematically avoiding the annoying high-end lead drones and stagnant 2 note chugs that were imported from KoRn 22 years ago. Long time lead guitarist Andreas Kisser has likewise decided to step out of the shadow of the 1990s \"guitar solos suck\" mindset and offers up an array of shred happy nods to Alex Skolnick and Dimebag Darrell that put Phil Demmel's recent work with Machine Head to shame.\n\nThis is obviously not an album without flaws, as often times the groove elements will occasionally result in stagnation/awkwardness, but it is surprisingly less of an issue than it usually proves to be. The opening number and title song \"Machine Messiah\" never really moves beyond a slow-paced drag, yet the charming mixture of influences from Slayer's \"South Of Heaven\" and the more doom-oriented side of Black Sabbath's history works well for the band. Perhaps most surprisingly of all is Derrick Green's reliance upon a low-end bass/baritone croon for most of the listen, drawing heavy similarities to the sadly departed Peter Steele, which he reprises on the closing number and similarly dystopian \"Cyber God\". Most of his vocal work is still lodged in the same hardcore infused shouting and shrieking that typifies the handiwork of Cavalera and Anselmo and is a bit one-dimensional, but plays well through most of the listen, and particularly in the faster-paced thrashers like \"I Am The Enemy\" and \"Vandals Nest\". Truth be told, other than the plodding and meandering that dominates \"Alethea\" and the somewhat djent-influenced yet symphonic \"Resistant Parasites\", every song on here is generally solid and memorable.\n\nIt is a foregone conclusion that anyone looking to hear the sort of archaic death thrashing mayhem that typified Schizophrenia and Beneath The Remains would be better served by looking to one of any number of retro-bands that have been cropping up in South America of late, as Sepultura has essentially drawn a line in the sand in favor of modernity comparable to that of Machine Head and Max Cavalera's various projects. Having said that, this is a far cry from the dregs of nu-metal lameness that has haunted this band for about as long as KoRn has been bastardizing the 7-string guitar as an instrument, and is definitely a metal album in the sense that the term ought to imply. It's about as busy and intense as recent outings by Exodus and Testament, though a bit more bent towards an eclectic mixture of industrial, symphonic and world music influences that don't quite move it into all out thrash metal territory. But for those who are looking for a groove driven album with some actual gusto, the future dysoptian nightmare presented by one of Brazil's most well-known musical exports in Machine Messiah is a cut above the rest.\n",
        "\nSepultura were still very much in their early, grimy, and bestial form when Schizophrenia rolled out in 1987. They were still with Cogumelo at this point, but their sound had managed to congeal into something more solid, vicious, and dark. The primitive and underdeveloped production and instrumental skills displayed on Morbid Visions are improved to feel more capable and mighty. Schizophrenia is where we see Sepultura come out of their infancy and develop into the musical demons who would terrorize far beyond the dark jungles of their tropical homeland. This album is a beast that grips you by the shoulders, carrying you through a cyclone of evil, never loosening its grip.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice after the goofy intro consisting of the sting music from the film Psycho, is just how fast, shadowy, and ripping this is. This is dark-as-hell, demonic thrash metal with the primordial, blood-dripping rage of early death metal thrown in. This is barbaric stuff, but not without skill, far from that, with the songs on here having riffs that eviscerate, but still manage to grow on you like a possession slowly taking over your mind. Speaking of possession, Max's throaty, demonic growl sounds like a menacing presence that exists just to torment unfortunate souls. The guitars call to mind bands like Slayer and Kreator, matching them on terms of darkness thanks to speed, tones and riff patterns of pure menace. \"From the Past Comes the Storms\" and \"Rest in Pain\" are downright sinister moshpit starters and are perfect choices to respectively start and end the album with. With everything between offering up a new pitch-black tornado of riffage and screaming, hair-raising solos at top speed with hellish barks describing the morbid scenarios. It is insane just how wicked Schizophrenia feels, and how they make their speed work without everything sounding too similar. There's not a lot of stylistic shuffling, but at least the songs are generally strong on their own.\n\nYou can also even hear how Sepultura have a little more ambition and creativity in them at this early stage. The wild, filthy, and deranged guitar soloing throughout the album, and the monumental, sinister, seven minute long instrumental \"Inquisition Symphony\" with atmosphere and riffs as blissful and as ominous as the onset of madness, are pieces that do a lot to show that Sepultura were aiming high, and they weren't playing around. While still very gritty and dirty, Schizophrenia shows more of a propensity for more focused songwriting and more planned-out aggression instead of going it 100% raw. It's the kind of shadowy and razor-sharp thrash that maintains a lot of rawness, but makes it so listeners will want to return to for the songs.\n\nFrom start to finish, Schizophrenia by Sepultura is the kind of insidious thrash that gets a grip on you, and sends you flying hard and fast through its guitar assaults. With impressive speed, evil atmosphere, sinister riffs, and improved production and musicianship, Schizophrenia is the kind of album that shows that this band is ready and eager to shred your face off and keep you coming back for seconds with its songs. The music manages to exude a downright evil and malicious aura that gives this album a lot of its fuel. It's a sign that Sepultura will go even further towards adding more death metal to the mix on their music that you'd hear in their future albums. For a blend of wildness, whipping riffs, and wickedness that will rip you to pieces, Sepultura's second album, Schizophrenia is something to seek out.\n",
        "\nI was 14 years old when I first heard a Sepultura tune. It was back the summer of 2003, and I was back at my hometown in the island of Olutanga Zamboanga Sibugay, when my cousin from the city visited us and introduced me to the music of Sepultura. My cousin had a cassette of the band's sixth studio album, Roots, and he always played it every day during the time he was with us. I got hooked to it and Sepultura became one of the first metal bands that I had known. Back then my hometown had no access of the internet, as it is located far south in a remote island in the Philippines, that is why getting information about bands was really difficult.\n\nIt was not until my freshman year in college that I started to dig more deeper into the realm of metal that I discovered Sepultura's \"Morbid Visions\", \"Schizophrenia\", \"Beneath the Remains\", \"Arise\", and \"Chaos A.D.\". The moment I found out about those albums, I lost interest to \"Roots\" and started collecting their old records. With what I discussed above I think it's pretty clear that outside the mentioned albums earlier, I never picked up any later records from this band. And after listening to their latest \"Machine Messiah\" offering, it reinforced my satisfaction of having no regrets in not following the band.\n\nMachine Messiah summarizes the reason why a lot of metalheads -- who once followed Sepultura -- do not purchase any of the band's releases anymore. The album carried on the band's more 'groove-laden merged with modern djent' style of metal. Andreas Kisser's repetitive usage of grooves and unessential utilization of djent tunes are very well documented in this album. Grooves and high-gained distorted palm-muted low-pitch guitar sounds are only good when the musician who is using it knows where and when to insert it. But utilizing them ceaselessly in an album will only make the whole output dull. The drum work is decent, when we talk about the technical section of Eloy Casagrande's drumming, but then as the record goes on it gets a bit of a clich\u00e9 and unvarying.\n\nI can continue to talk about how unforgivably cringe-worthy the album is, but I know that it isn't going to change anything. Modern mainstream fans might buy this kind of release, but not me. I am pretty sure that the connoisseurs of true extreme metal music, and old the old guards, will find this album unworthy to even just waste the time of discussing.\n\nSepultura might have stood up for what they believe when they took this musical path, but it's clearly not working for them when it comes to creating a solid and memorable album. It might work for kids these days and sell a couple of copies, however it failed to impress those who have seen the band's true potential supposing they stayed genuine to their old (\"Morbid Visions\" to \"Arise\" era to be precise) musical style.\n\nTo sum it all up, I suggest that you stay away from Machine Messiah as far as you can. This record is very dreadful and it's not worth the spin if you want to enjoy good old metal music. Somebody please tell Andreas and the rest of the band to just stop making new unnecessary releases and just call it quits already.\n",
        "\nJust for a little bit of context here, I have absolutely no familiarity with Sepultura's career in the 21st century. Beneath the Remains is a cornerstone thrash album for me and one that truly made me appreciate the genre, but I wouldn't exactly call myself a Sepultura fanboy. I also own and enjoy Schizophrenia and Arise, I've heard a little bit of Chaos A.D. and thought it was alright, and that one \"Roots Bloody Roots\" song is honestly one of the better nu-metal songs I've heard with the pop-tribal feel to it. I mostly fell in love with the intense, ripping thrash, and while I can appreciate the groovy direction for what it is, it just doesn't turn my crank as much. I saw Machine Messiah available used, and figured at least the cover art was kinda neat. I had no idea what this was going to sound like, but this band was responsible for me seeing why thrash was actually good, so I could at least give it a shot. \n\nI probably should have taken the fact that someone traded back a 2017 release by a large metal band on a major label so soon after buying it as a clue that something was up, but, well, now we're here. It starts off with a ballad-esque intro featuring some sightly croony singing, but it's not horrible or anything. The production's nice, although the harsh vocals aren't my favorite. This is my first exposure to Derrick Green, and I gotta say I definitely prefer Max's caveman grunts over Green's strained yelling. It's competent enough that I can tolerate it, but I just can't really dig the tone. \"I am the Enemy\" is promising enough, baiting you in with a no-frills thrash ripper trying its absolute best to sound like the heaviest thing the band's ever done, but it loses a bit of momentum around the breakdown. It still gets your hopes up for the rest of the album. Traditional thrash metal is in vogue now, so it's not too much of a stretch to think Sepultura went back to their roots (no pun intended) in order to cash in on the trend...\n\nHowever, for the next few tracks, Machine Messiah pulls a 180 and sounds completely different. It's got a lot of syncopated rhythms (which combined with the groovier riffs leads to a lot of indirect similarities with djent) Maidenesque guitar leads and solos that just kind of trail off, and random orchestral flirtations that show up and exit without any major purpose. All of this put together forms a style I can only refer to as \"pseudo-prog\". It sounds equal parts Iron Maiden, Metallica, Dream Theater and Pantera, but there's never any apparent direction to the influences. This is best exemplified in \"Iceberg Dances\" which does everything and nothing at the exact same time. It's an instrumental piece that just throws a bunch of leading b-grade prog metal riffs together in the hopes that it will go somewhere. It has no reason to be instrumental, either. Overlooking the fact that the vocals on Machine Messiah are inconsequential to begin with, there's not really a level of structural depth to \"Iceberg Dances\" that necessitates a purely instrumental song. You can tell Sepultura just wanted you to hear them wank for a bit. But that's the thing: they don't even wank that hard. I call this \"pseudo-prog\" because despite grasping at straws for any novel ideas to bring to the table, nothing on Machine Messiah feels particularly heady or challenging. I just want to emphasize again how useless an orchestra sounds in this band. It adds an extra layer of sound that muffles the impact of the riffs, and it's not like anyone was craving an extra layer to this anyway. \n\nI do have a tendency to give a bit of extra flak to any thrash band that tries to shoehorn more progressive and groove elements into the music where they don't fit, but there are a couple of times where it works out okay. \"Sworn Oath\" is an okay track - the synth stuff sounds like more than an afterthought, and there's a bit of grandiosity in the melody. Makes me wonder if the band might actually benefit if they just pulled a Fleshgod Apocalypse and went all-out with the symphonics, but Sepultura would never double down on something like that. Fact of the matter is, this is a band that still has to appease their fans, and I guess their fans want a 50/50 hybrid of Dimmu Borgir and Pantera? If Sepultura fully committed to one vibe, this might be something worth hearing, but for the most part, this just sounds like a bloated, purposeless mess from a band desperate to create something relevant. They're trying everything and nothing's working. It's not like the band gives a fuck, either. They probably still sold a shitload of albums and will be content to pump out another haphazard mishmash of mediocre ideas in a few years' time. This review isn't gonna change anything, but I still think Machine Messiah sucks.\n",
        "\nSepultura still has it. Legendary Brazilian extreme metal act, that has dominated the South American heavy metal scene, still comes out on top with this new album. The departure of the Cavalera brothers proved to be controversial among fans but I believe they have still put out some solid material. This album however, is on another level.\n\nThis album is clearly aiming for a more progressive sound with longer songs, more diverse instrumentation and a sort of concept album about the robotization of our society that posits that we may one day worship the machines we created. These things aren't that new to Sepultura necessarily. They just manifested in a way that feels fresh and compelling. The instrumental Iceberg Dances is epic with its driving drumbeats, guitars that alternate between heavy and dissonant and some nice organ sounds backing them up. The songs Chosen Skin, Silent Violence, Vandals Nest and, my favorite, I Am The Enemy all showcase Sepultura doing what Sepultura does best: thrashy, speedy, energetic metal bangers. But they slow down and show a more Pantera influenced groove metal direction on tracks like Sworn Oath, Phantom Self and Resistant Parasites that also bring down the house. Watching them play these songs live was an intense mosh fest. Phantom Self is another favorite of mine with its heavy guitars riffs, sick solo, amazing percussion intro, icy strings and its lyrics dealing with identity in the digital age. Creating a fake self on the internet. It's such a uniquely Sepultura song. My least favorite track is Alethea. The technical drumming and groove patterns are overwrought and it does get a little repetitive and stale. It lacks the exciting hooks of songs like Machine Messiah, Phantom Self and I Am The Enemy. Their cover of the Ultraseven theme was novel and it made me laugh, but hearing this metal rendition was also pretty badass. It really does sound like the theme song of a giant superhero that fights giant monsters.\n\nThe Songwriting is fantastic overall. They didn't reinvent the wheel or anything, they just set out to make a badass metal record and mission accomplished. Derrick Green's vocals are as savage and animalistic as ever and he shows that he can go toe to toe with the mighty Max Cavalera on this record. Andreas Kisser still kills it with some heavy, throttling guitar work but also some dissonant and melodic moments. The drumming was very unique and technical but still generally energetic and fun to listen to. The bass work holds up the rest of the music very well with some driving rhythms backing the utter insanity surrounding it. The occasional industrial synths and South American percussion sections really give this album a unique sound that contains some of Sepultura's most memorable tracks in years. This is easily the best post-Cavalera Sepultura album and it was a great and memorable listen. Severely underrated. 8.5/10\n",
        "\nThis is has to be one of the heaviest thrash metal albums to ever be released by a band. Seriously, the first time I heard this album, I was blown away and to be honest, quite shocked to be honest. I'm one of the few people who actually enjoyed Chaos A.D. and Roots. Those two albums were my introduction to not only Sepultura, but also Max Cavalera. So, imagine my surprise when I heard the title track for the first time. Arise is the heaviest thrash metal song I've ever heard in my life, and I'll fight anyone who disagrees with me. Seriously, the build up to the first minute of actual music on this song is so worth it, because after waiting for what feels like a lifetime, those blazing fast riffs coming flying right out the gate, and then Igor ABSOLUTELY FUCKS OUR FACES with how fast he plays on this song. LISTEN TO THAT DOUBLE BASS! Any drummer who can play that fast is automatically someone I'm gonna look up to, because I still can't do the double bass that fast even after a year of building up my chops. But anyway, back to the review. Arise is the perfect indication for what we're in for when one listens to Arise. Fast, skull-crushingly heavy riffs, and a vocalist who sounds like the perfect bridge between death and thrash metal. \n\nWhen listening to Arise, there are defiantly a lot of songs similar in vein to the title track. However, this is also when the boys decided to experiment a little more in their music, as demonstrated by the number of mid-tempo tracks on this album. Now as much as I loved Beneath The Remains, this is a VERY welcome change of pace, for Beneath The Remains begins to drag by the time you get to the end of the album, while this album has more of a \"flow\" so to speak and variety than Beneath The Remains does. One of my favorite songs off this album is Desperate Cry. This song is simply perfection, and it's probably one of my favorite songs in general now that I think about it. What starts off as a simple mid-tempo thrash song with plenty of aggression and plenty of blistering double bass, eventually evolves into yet another thrasher with a melodic solo, then evolves into something truly amazing. Half way through the song, all the anger, pain, and frustration stop for a minute, and we hear something truly beautiful. The tempo slows down, Andreas or Max (don't really know which one comes in first) play a solo that one could sum up as Iron Maiden-ish, and then both guitarists come in, creating one of the most beautiful harmonies I've ever heard in a solo, before returning to a fit of rage. To me, this song is the highlight of the entire album, and is worth a listen based on that song ALONE. Seriously, if I could recommend one song the most off of Arise, it would be Desperate Cry. \n\nLyrically, this album is VERY different than what Max would go on to write later with albums like Roots and even in Soulfly. This album is dark as hell, make no mistake about it. This isn't something you'd put on if you wanna hear some happy metal. No, these are straight-up realistic lyrics talking about a lot of messed up political stuff. While Max may not be an amazing lyricist to some, I've always felt his lyrics were awesome, and albums like this only prove my point. It isn't afraid to touch upon subjects most of their peers may have been reluctant to talk about such as poverty. This album is real as hell, and doesn't try to be something it's not. \n\nThis right here is Sepultura's crowning achievement during the Max Cavalera years. It has plenty of furiously fast songs that'll appeal to fans of albums such as Morbid Visions, Schizophrenia, and Beneath The Remains, while also appealing to those who may have only listened to their groove metal albums with the numerous mid-tempo tracks found on here. This is essential listening here people, do not miss out on this album if you haven't already heard it. This ain't no Reign In Blood, this is Arise, and it will destroy your existence.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s that time again, another year, another Sepultura album and you know the drill, the \u201cSepultura isn\u2019t Sepultura without Max Cavalera!\u201d brigade are always out in full force. These people have been banging the same drum for 20 years now, Sepultura are shit without Cavalera, wah, wah, wah, wah, blah, blah, blah. Truth is, Cavalera departed and since then, Sepultura have done their best to continue, granted they\u2019ve never managed to scale the heights that Sepultura managed in the 1990\u2019s with 'Arise', 'Chaos A.D.' and 'Roots' and their post 'Roots' output can be described as patchy at best. Despite this, there are some true gleaming gems in within the Derrick Green era with the big man at the front just as important in Sepultura\u2019s history as everybody else.\n\n'Machine Messiah' grinds into action with the brooding title track, in which the music has that gothic slow burning feeling, coupled with Green\u2019s deep melodic vocals that wouldn\u2019t be out of place with the likes of Paradise Lost before breaking into the familiar sound of Sepultura for the chorus. The iconic guitar sound of Andreas Kisser has been the stalwart, instantly recognisable tone of Sepultura for the best part of 30 years now and has somehow always managed to stay relevant. With 'Machine Messiah', between the guitar tone of Kisser and the phenomenal drumming of Eloy Casagrande, particularly during 'I Am the Enemy' makes this album sound fresh and full of the vitality of a younger band, than a band already hugely established.\n\nConcept album. In the 21st century, it can be a bit of a dirty word, conjuring up images of overblown, bloated 1970\u2019s progressive rock bands over 6 sides of vinyl. However, Sepultura themselves have stated that 'Machine Messiah' is a concept album, based on the human reliance upon technology these days. You won\u2019t find any epics here and no sagas, what you get with 'Machine Messiah' is pedal to the floor heavy metal. In an ironic way, Sepultura have come full circle and are embracing a more thrash metal sound again with Green able to provide the band with the hardcore sounding voice where he cut his teeth. There are glimpses of what made Sepultura famous though, the Brazilian samba ethnic feel that begins 'Phantom Self' develops into a groove metal masterpiece that certainly wouldn\u2019t be out of place on 'Chaos A.D.' or 'Roots'.\n\nThe highlights of 'Machine Messiah' are the extremely rhythmic groove of 'Alethea', 'Alethea' attacks the conditioning of the masses to believe everything they see and hear, the mesmerising chorus with its orchestrated heights of 'Sworn Oath' and possibly the best track on 'Machine Messiah', 'Resistant Parasites'. 'Resistant Parasites' builds up to a simple chorus riff that is actually extremely reminiscent of 'Pride In Prejudice' from Slayer\u2019s latest album, 'Repentless', but we won\u2019t say anymore on that one! Alas, 'Resistant Parasites' attacks the rampant hyper-consumerism that requires getting the cheapest quality for the highest price and the consequences that these actions bring.\n\n'Machine Messiah' is the best Sepultura album released with Derrick Green on vocals. 'Machine Messiah' is fresh and given the strength of the songs on this album, it wouldn\u2019t be highly surprising at the end of the year if 'Machine Messiah' was riding high and hopefully, Sepultura will follow this album with something equally as good.\n",
        "\nMy thought when I think about bands that have been out there, touring and releasing albums year after year for like two or three decades, is only: is there still any passion? Or are they just doing this because, you know, they have to feed their children? Bands start as fun and suddenly become business, it\u2019s always something like that and, as natural as it may be, a dozen or more years after your favorite band from the 80\u2019s changed almost one hundred percent of its original lineup, you don\u2019t feel like you are listening to the same band anymore. \n\nSepultura, the legendary Brazilian thrash death metal band, is no exception. It remains with only fifty percent of its original lineup, and has changed its sonority a lot, including ambient elements from Brazilian culture, tribal percussion, groove and hardcore riffing. The band has been in the scene for 33 year now and still releasing albums every two or three years like they just don\u2019t fucking care. But\u2026 is there still any passion for metal music left in the guys? Well, Machine Messiah tells me that, yes, they still have the feeling for it. This album is by far one of the best they have released in many, many years. I have to mention that I really liked Kairos, but despite two or three really good songs, it lacked consistency. \n\nMachine Messiah is an astronomical improvement and already stands out as a landmark in Sepultura\u2019s long career. The album has a clean production, focusing mainly on the basic instruments, but there was also space for many additional elements like classical orchestrations, tribal percussion and a lot of vocal variations. This is Derrick Green\u2019s best performance to date and even his clean vocals sound really enjoyable in Machine Messiah. \n\nThe instrumental part is nothing but memorable. Andreas Kisser presents us with a variety of riffs that range from the classical thrash metal chugs to the most complex progressive patterns and his solos are just beyond impressive. The guitars on Machine Messiah play a big role in setting the pace for the album. Drummer Eloy Casagrande does an amazing job with an incredible display of technique and speed. His presence in the band was fundamental to suppress the lack of power left after Iggor Cavalera parted ways with Sepultura. Bassist Paulo Jr is consistent in making a solid background for the guitar work and again does his homework brilliantly, even having some highlights like in the title track.\n\nAlso, Sepultura\u2019s songwriting is complex and creative, choruses are catchy (listen to Phantom Self) and each song is pretty different from each other, which makes the album interesting to listen in its entirety. Machine Messiah is a definite proof that Sepultura still have the skills to reinvent themselves and deliver something really good. I am really excited to see what will happen to these guys in the future and really hope that they can still produce good albums like this one.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.naturezadocaos.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nWhat do once glorious bands like Flotsam and Jetsam, Dimmu Borgir and Sepultura have in common with the Third Reich? They just cannot stop until the reputation and everything else is completely ruined. Thank God, in sharp contrast to Hitler's domain, the glorious beginnings of the aforementioned groups were not based on a dangerous ideology. Sepultura's second full-length shows an aspiring thrash band that offers everything in order to storm the top of the bill. Fury and control are well balanced, ferocity is of high relevance, dynamic plays a main role as well. The high class riffs are a chapter by itself. Not to mention the powerful, rapid drumming. Please recognize the perfect double bass! Finally, the different song structures ensure a long-lasting joy of listening. In short, the pictures of the single band members on the back of the cover capture the energetic, horrifying and sinister atmosphere of the music very exactly.\n\nThe relatively crude sounds of the predecessors of \"Schizophrenia\" have made way for masterly flowing tracks. \"Inquisition Symphony\" is an instrumental with a duration of more than seven minutes and we all know that this configuration bears the risks of repetitiveness and mediocrity. Yet Sepultura pass the test with flying colours. The track presents a long chain of excellent riffs and the abrasive guitars, the tempo changes and the unbridled power of the restless horde create a great song which does not lack anything. This is not to say that the roughshod vocals fall short of expectations, but they are also not an elementary component for the success of the album. Max Cavalera does not reveal an overdose of charisma. Nonetheless, he fulfils his task in an acceptable manner. The entire second half of the full-length is acceptable as well, there are no throwaway tracks and Sepultura do not integrate any stylistically inappropriate elements. Nevertheless, the highlights have been bundled on the A side.\n\nObviously paved with good intentions, the Brazilians have forged three tracks that shine with maturity, musicality and velocity. \"From the Past Comes the Storms\", \"To the Wall\" and \"Escape to the Void\" surpass the more or less clumsy tunes of the first outputs with great ease. These tracks have a gargantuan inner strength due to their brilliant, Slayer-influenced riffing, catchy sections (for example the chorus of \"Escape to the Void\") and an adequate number of surprising breaks (inter alia at the end of \"To the Wall\"). This does not mean that the breaks kill the power of the songs. There are many relentless, straight and angry parts which have the potential to defoliate the Brazilian rainforest. No doubt, Sepultura prove their capability to write more or less sophisticated songs that do not lack of accessibility. The crucial factor might be that the band does not aim for overly non-conventional patterns as an end in itself. They just form the songs the way they like it and a fairly conservative pattern is not forbidden as well. \"Escape to the Void\" proves evidence in this context.\n\nThe production is better than the artwork and worse than the music. Stupid information? I agree. Okay, in other words: the sound is neither heavyweight nor very voluminous, but the guitars possess the right degree of sharpness, the drum sound does not split skulls, but it reaches a solid level and the overall impression is free from severe signs of weakness. Last but not least, \"Schizophrenia\" was the last album of the band whose mix scores with the charm of the underground. Its successors did not lack of a sterile high-gloss productions, but they showed a more professional approach. However, to listen to this work is always a good idea. It gives the listener a glimpse of hope that Sepultura will return to strength some day. And right now, you can call me a pretty crazy optimist, a \"Septic Schizo\" or whatever else, I don't mind. The long-term impact of \"Schizophrenia\" feeds my soul.\n",
        "\nGreat opener! \"Sepulnation\" creates a dense and sinister atmosphere, it possesses a high degree of intensity, sharp riffing and an eerie part with strange background vocals. Moreover, it seems to be a promising attempt to stop the identity crisis of the meandering formation in the post-Max times. The artwork with its archaic, communist charm and the almost eponymous title of the album point in the same direction. Is this the output which builds a bridge to their classic works, not in term of style, but in terms of quality?\n\nA brief glance at my rating gives the answer: no, definitely not. The remaining songs show blatantly that the formation has no clue what it stands for. Expressionless outbursts like \"Revolt\" and \"Human Cause\" are manageable for the sorely afflicted listener. But the confusing mix of comparatively heavy riffs, whiny sections and industrial elements makes it hard to listen to the entire album. In particular the vocals go in the ditch. Derrick Green delivers many different pitches. He provides spoken word sections, he screams and shouts and he tries to create emotions while singing in a more or less melodic manner (\"Saga\", \"Water\"). Verdict: willing, but not able. I cannot identify an overarching goal of his performance. He fails on all fronts.\n\nThe same applies for the music. Psychedelic parts like those in \"The Ways of Faith\" are not total bullshit, yet this is not the music I want to hear when listening to an album of a thrash band. One can use these sounds when they match the concept. To make a hazardous comparison: Sepultura fail where Melechesh hit the bull's eye. The oriental ingredients of the latter constitute an integral component of their offering, while Sepultura expand their musical horizon at any price, but without any underlying strategy. The subdued \"Uma Cura\", to give but one example, wants to be one of many experimental highlights, but it is just to blame for being insubstantial and stupid.\n\nThe guitar work is not so bad, but whenever the band gets back to its metallic roots (I mean their first works, not the eponymous album), it seems as if the guys use the same grinding riff again and again. Is this still \"Roots, Bloody Roots\"? Not to mention the discreet tribal drumming that appears every now and then. Yet the song writing remains the main problem of the album. Songs like \"Tribe to a Nation\" just suck in view of their miserable one-tone-chorus. Instead of forging a comparatively solid album with a duration of 35 or 40 minutes, the guys disclose the fact that they are not able to write an adequate amount of strong material for a more or less excessive full-length. No doubt, Kisser and the other guys had taken the wrong pills while composing and recording this work. By the way, the production is okay, but this fact is totally irrelevant in view of these songs. Roughly speaking: one killer, 19 fillers (maybe with the exception of the slightly dramatic outro of the regular edition, which was co-written by a guy of Apocalyptica). Recommended only for those Brazilians who had fun while watching the semi-final of the Football World Cup in 2014.\n",
        "\nNumerous bands have gone through stylistic alterations in their musical career, which ultimately leads to fans questioning whether the new material will live up to any music prior to this definitive change of sound. \n\nThis bridge between the \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 may be found after a number of factors: members may depart (like In Flames, Metallica, Iron Maiden and Anthrax), the band might branch out to other genres (Opeth), or the record reflects the era it was released in (Machine Head). For whatever reason, there always seems to be this illusive line in a band\u2019s career that dictates how successful their new music will turn out to be. Doubtless, the question surrounding Sepultura\u2019s 14th album, \u201cMachine Messiah\u201d, will be: \u201cIs it as good as the Max Cavalera era?\u201d\n\nFirstly, this album is easily the best album Sepultura have created that feature Derrick Green\u2019s contributions. The Brazilians cram ample amounts of nostalgia into their 14th album that hearken back to the band\u2019s thrash and death metal roots. \u2018Silent Violence\u2019, \u2018I Am The Enemy\u2019 and \u2018Vandal\u2019s Nest\u2019 are both maelstroms of frantic riffs and Eloy Casagrande\u2019s hyperactive blastbeats. Consequently, the sheer bluntness that each song executes enhances Sepultura\u2019s punk influence, which significantly rose during Green\u2019s enlistment in 1998. Jens Bogren (Amon Amarth, Kreator, Soilwork) also concocts a broad and crisp production that makes these vicious songs appear all the more monstrous.\n\nHowever, this album isn\u2019t just some blatant effort to return to the band\u2019s origins. Upon hearing \u201cMachine Messiah\u201d, you can tell that the members of Sepultura are comfortable with the altered appearance they made to the band since 1998 and, presently, continue to explore their stylistic capabilities. So many curveballs are thrown around in this album, signalling that the band is pushing themselves to remain significant. \u2018Phantom Self\u2019 is a typically jagged groove metal song, with an infectious chorus, while Eastern, symphonic elements stands parallel to the staccato menace Andreas Kisser simultaneously conjures. At times, this fresh progression occasionally sounds alien. The title track is oddly mellow and generally directionless, \u2018Cyber God\u2019 has a suitably mechanic djent method, and the wild instrumental track, \u2018Iceberg Dances\u2019, twirls around prancing riffs, jittering acoustics and bubbly keyboards. Call it shocking or call it inventive: this is the sound of Sepultura, once again in their career, wildly expanding their traditional sound.\n\nSo, is it as good as the Max Cavalera era? The short answer: No. Primarily, this is because every year that passes is another year for the value of Sepultura\u2019s classic albums, \u201cArise\u201d, \u201cChaos A.D\u201d and \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d, has to mature even further. A more reasonable question: How does this album compare to the post-Max era?\n\n\u201cMachine Messiah\u201d is a revitalising reason to continue caring about a band, who were once irrefutably paramount in metal, that many fans have elected to abandon.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/72655/Sepultura-Machine-Messiah/\n",
        "\nI can't sit here and tell you that Machine Messiah has rid itself of all the vapid, bouncing, predictable hardcore grooves that the band more or less mastered and subsequently exhausted with the albums Chaos A.D. and Roots back in the mid 90s. I also can't promise you that I've suddenly become a fan of Derrick Green's vocals; granted, the guy's been with the Brazilians now for almost 20 years, and his style has never deviated too far from the original, roughshod and grunting and barking aesthetics of his predecessor. No, despite the fact he has always been technically sound on the many releases he has fronted, his harsher vocals have always felt played out to me, lacking individual distinction against the hundreds or thousands of other groove metal or nu-metal growlers you'd have found at the corner bars during the Ozzfest era and forward. His sound has not changed much here, and it simply lacks the viciousness or raw, murderous quality that I associate with and love from early Sepultura.\n\nBut here's what I CAN tell you...\n\nThis is the most engaged I've been with a Sepultura record since 1993. That's not to say that albums like Dante XXI, Kairos and The Mediator Between Head and Hands Must Be the Heart lacked any semblance of highlights. Sure, I could string together a solid album's worth of content between 1994 and 2013. Maybe even a double disc set. But Machine Messiah manages to strike an eclectic range between the band's tribal instincts, their LCD grooves and then a slightly tighter and more technical Sepultura which offers a lot more candy for the ears. A lot of this comes directly through Andreas Kisser's writing and performance...when he leaves behind the stolid attempts to ape the success they had with such simple mosh components in the 90s post-Arise, he explores some more compelling and busy picking sequences that really tipped the balance for my desire to listen repeatedly. It makes me wish this were the norm for this band in the 21st century, that they had expressed a desire to become increasingly more progressive like a lot of their international peers had already achieved by the late 80s. I realize that would seem anathema to a core of their audience that just wants to reel around violently and crush each other, but it's a damn shame...\n\nIt even carries forward to the leads, which are very well executed, never extended beyond their welcome and almost unanimously catchy whether they just be frenetic and spontaneous, atonal, Eastern inspired and exotic, or all of the above. Having these licks riding atop even the most banal of rhythm guitar breakdowns instantly adds some levity and depth which I feel a lot of albums they've put out have largely lacked. Eloy Casagrande also turns in a spotless performance here, effortlessly putting up a level of energy that would be fit for most modern thrash or death metal records, but constantly applying that primal, ethnic, 'jungle' spread of fills and rumbling grooves that will remind many of the more (and only) interesting moments of Roots; only here, I like the riffs better, and that goes a long way. Bass-lines are perfectly mixed, just fat enough to register against the clean but punchy rhythm guitar tone and often a little busier than you've come to expect from that area. In truth the album sounds really great overall...polished but not lacking some force where required, and also leaving some room for the more elegant lead tone, cleaner guitars and so forth.\n\nSo with so much going for it, the few flaws here are quite easy to forgive. The vocals are acceptable, even when he's doing his lower range Layne Stayley-meets-Nick Cave crooning like in the titular intro or \"Cyber God\". Would I like it better with Max? I'm sure a lot of folks would, but that's not to discredit a reasonable effort from Green. The grooves in tunes like \"Iceberg Dances\" are straight from the Chaos A.D. playbook, or reminiscent of other bands from Machine Head to 90s Ministry, and even if a lot of them weren't so interesting, they do at least tap into that same, sweltering testosterone center in the brain that makes you want to riot a little. The lyrics are honestly pretty bland, the usual self-help sociopolitical stuff which is supposed to make you feel good but just doesn't possess enough grasp of imagination, metaphor or catchy phrasing to make that difference. Also it has a song called \"Cyber God\" and I really wish we were through with everyone having a song dubbed \"Cyber\" something. That feels 1998 at best.\n\nBut it's the strong variation in pacing between thrashers and slower bruisers, and the willingness to toss out a few new ideas like the colorful orchestration synthesized into \"Phantom Self\" that kept me paying attention through the entirety of the disc, and that give me some further hope that all sparks of inspiration and creativity have not fled the band across the decades, and maybe they're on the verge of producing something great again. That said, I'll gladly take stuff like this in the meantime.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nA torrent is probably the best word I could use to describe this. Mediator is Sepultura's album for 2013 and this album is one with just a bit more energy placed in the mix. The addition of young drummer Eloy Casagrande and the return of producer Ross Robinson must've really helped some vigor return to Sepultura because out this is the first of the albums with Derrick Green that caught my ear and managed to stick. It's got a unique sound which I can only describe as a beefy, groovy thrash album with Roots-style production. Sure, it's no return to form hearkening back to 1991, and it's not some new classic sent to shake the metal world up. But it's damn heavy, damn punchy, damn fast, and damn nice.\n\nThe sound on Mediator is ultimately a continuation of their post-Cavalera sound with extra speed and tighter riffing than on previous output. The songwriting and riffs still feel rather standard, but there's much more of a kick this time around. Ross Robinson's production style is known for its bass and that extra bass plus the downtuning gives an extra punch to the guitar grooves as well as a massive, sludgy feeling to the mix which makes Mediator and its nasty grooves sound all the more gnarly and all-engulfing. Fast riffing mixes well with the muddy production to create a sound bigger and thicker than a volcanic mudslide. This mixture is developed the most on songs like \"Trauma of War\", \"The Age of the Atheist\", and \"The Vatican.\" Tribal percussion from Casagrande continues Sepultura's unique flavor of percussion, and thanks to his youth, adds a much needed injection of speed. Many songs sound generic, but serviceable while they're there. Musically, it's no tour de force, but if you want an album full of brutish thrash-and-bash tunes with an undercurrent of sludge, you're in the right place.\n\nThis is decent stuff, not anything that would set the world on fire, though \"The Age of the Atheist\" is one of the most solid post-Cavalera Sepultura songs recorded. Mediator gets the job done hard and heavy like concrete. I would say it's worth at least a listen.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing one concept album after another, Sepultura returned to a more conventional approach to making music on Kairos. No more inspiration from books, and no more obsession with experimental integration of sounds like tribal drumming or symphonic orchestra. On Kairos, they go back to simply being a 4-piece band, and the music is all about what they can do with strictly their own instruments and themes they come up on their own. \n\nThe end product of Sepultura's back-to-basics approach on Kairos was not a material worthy of an inclusion in any year-end lists, but nonetheless showcases a solid songwriting chops and tight musicianship. Here, Andreas Kisser and co. dropped the nu-metal/groove metal vibe and refrained from flirting with classical or ethnic arrangements. Songwriting is consistent at a relatively high standard, and they are focused on keeping songs to-the-point - no segments or riffs overstay its welcome. I honestly cannot think of a single song that felt like it had extra baggage, so a big congrats to the band for keeping the album lean. But Sepultura is not really Sepultura without some sort of experimentation; on Kairos, the guest concept is industrial metal. This influence is most evident on \u201cJust One Fix\u201d, \u201cFire Starter\u201d (both of which are cover songs done well), and \u201c4648\u201d, and provides a subtle undertone on other songs like \u201cKairos\u201d, \u201cDialog\u201d, and \u201cEmbrace the Storm\". \n\nThe problem with Kairos is that there\u2019s not a lot that stands out; if Kairos was a school, then the songs are a bunch of great students, with only a few that actually stand out with a unique character (that would be \u201cSpectrum\u201d and \u201cKairos\u201d, and \u201cNo One Will Stand\u201d, the last of which is a great song that takes you back to Beneath the Remains/Arise era). It's comfortable, it feels good listening because the quality is there, but it just doesn't have that extra bite to make it memorable as a whole. This is why the album deserves all the praise it gets and yet fails to reach a wider audience beyond patient Sepultura fans. \n\nLyrics on Kairos is a curious element on this particular album. Derrick Green was never a great lyricist, and unlike the previous two albums where he had an actual piece of literature to base his words off of, Kairos suffers from mediocrity (\u201cRelentless\u201d is a prime example) in this department. At the same time though, Derrick is delivering a very determined statement - 15 years since Max Cavalera departed, Derrick has been in the band longer than Max has been by the time Sepultura was writing Kairos, and his lyrics here are an honest reflection of his determination to carry on through hostility and ridicule he receives time and time again for the simple fact he isn\u2019t Max. Listening through this album, it's hard not to admire his will to keep going. \n\nIn all honesty, I\u2019m surprised by how people are \u201csurprised\u201d by the quality of this album and the following album, The Mediator..... I\u2019m the opposite - I was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the quality when I bought Kairos, and I still feel that this is their least impressive album since Roorback. That being said, I\u2019m only disappointed relative to their other recent outputs, and Kairos is still light years ahead of Sepultura\u2019s late 90s/early 00s stuff.\n",
        "\nSepultura were on a big experimental high, looking for new sounds to add to their own, Brazilian tribal music, punk rock, and Pantera-style groove metal were added to their repertoire of influences with Chaos A.D. and with all of that supported by a thrashy backbone, it worked extremely well, bringing us a riot starter of an album. As the 1990's dragged on and thrash metal had effectively died off for a time, the bands who adapted best to the new alternative landscape were the new big names in metal during this time, bands such as Faith No More, Pantera, White Zombie, Machine Head, Tool, Alice in Chains, and of course Sepultura. Sepultura was the one among these bands (aside from Pantera) who'd gone through the biggest number of changes stylistically, and were the ones looking for new sounds the most voraciously. Max Cavalera's experiments with the industrial metal project Nailbomb would further emphasize their desire to look for new sounds. This would lead them towards Korn, who were a strange specimen and relative newcomers in 1995. That would lead them towards the making of Roots.\n\nAt the point in time when Roots was being made, nu metal wasn't a fully formed genre yet, and certainly wasn't the horrendous trend it would become later. The only two nu metal bands of note who had released anything of significance were Korn and the Deftones who had only released one album each before Roots was made. I'm not going to levy accusations of bandwagon-jumping towards Sepultura because at that point in time, there was no bandwagon to even jump onto. Roots, while dumbed-down compared to their earlier work, feels more like genuine experimentation than outright trend-hopping (Soulfly on the other hand... yuck), it still feels like a natural change next to Chaos. The Limp Bizkits, Slipknots, and Stainds of the world had yet to even show their faces, and Korn and the Deftones were still fairly low-profile, not reaching their later fame yet.\n\nHowever, just because you do something different does not automatically make it good. This album was influenced by Korn, and that band has plenty of problems on their own. The drumming is probably the only thing that is strong on this album, that and the guitar tone (thicker than the smoke from burning rainforests), but the actual guitar playing, the vocals, lyrics, and song structures all suffer on Roots. There's a small number of decent songs like the combat-ready beatdown grooves on \"Attitude\" or the thrashy \"Spit.\" Much of the rest of this album is just lacking. Kisser and Paulo just lay down a lot of chugging, which can work if varied a bit and mixed with something else, but here almost every song does it, and many songs just end up sounding stale, with any activity in the songs feeling lethargic. Sure, it sounds really angry, but it gets to the point that it all feels very constipated. Max is also no saint here, since he's just shouting at you, and his voice lacks the depth that someone like Robb Flynn or Phil Anselmo would have to make that style work. He sounds strained like he just pulled a muscle. He also scat-sings on some songs, and that just sounds like he has rabies from hanging out in the jungle for too long and degrades his lyrics into slurred gibberish on \"Breed Apart\" and \"Ratamahatta\", which also has Carlinhos Brown babbling a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that doesn't even sound like Portuguese. Most of the lyrics have also degraded from Chaos A.D. from rebellious social commentary to \"FIGHT ME, MOTHERFUCKER! YOU BETRAYED ME! FUCK THIS SHIT!\" Now I see why this was so influential with Slipknot. Damn, this album has problems.\n\nEven with all that, there are some redeemable things about Roots. On faster and groovier tracks, the guitars do very well. I already mentioned \"Attitude\" and \"Spit\", but there are other tracks that work like \"Dusted\" which is very simple, but has a groove about it perfect for caving another man's face in with your fist. \"Ambush\" is also pretty fierce too. The tribal pieces are nice to hear even if they are more jarringly different from the other songs than on Chaos A.D. Tribal instrumentation is nice to hear, and makes even the more mediocre tracks contain something interesting to accent them. If only these elements had been used in better songs. The fight-groove songs are the ones that work, since the other songs either drag on one riff for too long, or have some obnoxious scatting to slather all over. They work since their rhythms are appropriate for the tone of Roots. A lot of filler and bad ideas could have been canned and this would have been so much more satisfying.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a huge step down from their earlier albums and the oversimplified nature of Roots doesn't help it's case. It also introduced a lot of new ideas, only a few of which work. The tribal pieces, nice. The scatting and nu metal, don't bother. If these guys had just kept the complexity of Chaos A.D. or Arise, this could have amounted to so much more. I guess that's the thing about experimenting with new sounds, you think it's a cool idea for a while, you get on an \"experimenting high\", but then you just don't know when to stop yourself if you end up devolving your sound instead of evolving. Granted it's bearable compared to many other nu metal albums, but it's embarrassing compared to older Sepultura.\n",
        "\nSepultura had grabbed international attention with Beneath the Remains and they had gone faster than ever when doing so. What happens when you hit peak speed? You find the need to focus that speed. With Arise, these Brazilians had started to slow just a bit to allow for a more focused, riff-centric performance that turns the blinding speed of earlier releases into songs that could rip the skin off a mastodon in 2 minutes flat and have several riffs and a solo worth discerning throughout that time. Many of Sepultura's most notable songs are on this album and it could easily be seen as Sepultura's equivalent of Slayer's Seasons in the Abyss another album where blistering speed and slow, deliberate focus compromised to build something much more memorable, devious, and riff-filled.\n\nArise is a blisteringly fast album that banks on its riffs and songwriting more than anything else. You can tell from the very first notes of the song \"Arise\" that this is a savage album that basks in destruction and hellfire to bring forth a warped, dying vision of our world where the pulse of the drums and the shredding guitars are the only rhythm to the chaos. The lyrics are still focused around death and terror, but political subtexts come in where authority and nationhood have their disgusting undersides examined through the terrifying lenses of Sepultura's eyes. Cavalera and Kisser's riffing is blinding, but also discernible and unique to every song. The guitars have a perfect tone for this, as it all sounds so menacing and evil, which is accented by Max Cavalera's spine-chilling barks which are still very easy to understand, exposing the full power of their lyrics. \"Arise\", \"Desperate Cry\", \"Dead Embryonic Cells\", and \"Altered State\" have some of the most insidious thrash riffing and ear-shredding solos ever produced to give them all an iconic, imposing presence. These songs make you know their identities loud and clear simply from their rhythm. It's catchy and full of virtuoso at the same time. When the rhythm is somewhere between a march and a charge like it often is on Arise, it transitions smoothly enough to feel innate, but it changes enough in tempo and rhythm to never become monotonous, despite their almost constant barrage. The few softer moments are still evil and oppressively dark like being stranded in a smoke-filled jungle with no idea what's coming out to get you. Every song makes great use of iconic riffing and evil melodies with a bit of catchiness a la Metallica tossed in. Sepultura's barrages leave us an album without even a shred of filler and solid rhythms upon solid rhythms. This is the perfect blend of catchy songwriting and downright vile riffs. This is Sepultura at the strongest balance of all of their abilities overall.\n\nArise is the definitive Sepultura album, and arguably one of the best thrash albums of the 1990's. It cuts deep and focuses hard on what makes a fast song truly powerful. It takes the speed, the riffs, the grooves, the evil, the catchiness, and the rage, to weld together a sound so memorable and so deathly that it outmatched all others. Every song on here is worth a listen and hits harder than the arsenal of hell itself. I recommend this wholeheartedly, this is a classic that's not worth missing.\n",
        "\nThe late 1980's and early 90's were a time of massive upheaval, the Soviet Union had started falling apart, massive protests were rocking Asia and Eastern Europe, threatening the communists with their eventual removal, Latin America was seeing a massive crime wave in some nations and the last of its US-backed dictators being deposed in others, and thrash metal was using up all of its old ideas and looking for new ones. Sepultura had been taking note of all this happening around them and over time their focus had shifted from simple speed and brutality with lyrics about the occult towards slower and more crushing fight-grooves with songs about the much more real horrors of pollution, illness, callous businesses, abusive and corrupt governments, unreliable media, bigotry, and war. With all of this going on, not just in the news, but with some of it even happening in Sepultura's own backyards, they're bound to want to lash out at all of that. Their music had been getting slower, scrappier, more pissed off, and more socially aware, even on Arise, but Chaos A.D. is where the riot-groove laden metal protest anthems come into their most complete form.\n\nChaos A.D. has a very vicious \"rise up and beat down your oppressor\" feeling about all of this. Punishing grooves that would rile a crowd into a frenzy abound on this album, and build tension as Cavalera shouts out his rallying cries of \"REFUSE... RESIST!\", \"WE'RE NOT SLAVES, WE'RE FREE!\", and \"WAR FOR TERRITORY!\" This is likely Sepultura's most quotable album with so many brutish, memorable grooves matching choruses that many a dissident could rally behind. This is also Sepultura's most diverse album, aside from the much more derided Roots. This not only has to do with the introduction of tribal and traditional Brazilian instruments in some songs, but also in the structures of the songs. There are slower, more atmospheric, and brooding songs like \"Amen\", fast, pure thrashers like \"Biotech is Godzilla\", and some oddities such as a tribal piece like \"Kaiowas\" that provides a nice, easy, but still stoic respite from the protest-stomp songs surrounding it. Other oddities include the use of industrial effects to create a tense \"news report\" styled description of a massive prison massacre and police cover-up in \"Manifest\", which makes it stand out as a blistering and unique experiment on Sepultura's part. These more unusual songs keep Chaos A.D. from becoming monotonous and allows Sepultura to show off just how extensive their musical abilities were. Every one of these tracks is fierce and uncompromising in its riffing and its devotion to revolution.\n\nChaos A.D. shows Sepultura's ability to be agile about their craft and still make it seem consistent. If you can get diversity and make it feel consistent, you've succeeded at crafting an album, especially one with such iconic songs as this. They're all concise, memorable, and are fueled by undiluted rebel anger. You've also succeeded if you can even best one of your influences with a cover of their work. New Model Army's \"The Hunt\" is made into something that feels much more like a rally to mob justice with its heavier take on the original's tense melodies. Every song rings with a desire to bring the world and all its governmental and business nonsense down to rubble. With all of this revolutionary rage spilling forth from my speakers, it's hard to contain my urge to just mosh. This is Chaos A.D., Sepultura's strongest usage of the almighty groove.\n",
        "\nAhh good old thrash! Quite a few thrash classics to choose from back in the 80s, but if I had to pick a list of my favourite albums from that era that still ring the nostalgia bell every goddamn time, this album would definitely be right up there. No two ways about that folks. This is Sepultura at their most bestial and primordial. Of course there will be that never-ending debate of \"This band immediately started to suck the moment Max left the band\" and let me clarify, that debate is for another time. This along with their other classic Beneath The Remains has officially been certified to obliterate your sorry ass and abandon your senses as you look for the nearest inanimate thing to pound into visps of nothingness. \n\nEnough people have spoken about these guys and Slayer side by side, but I will say this - With this album and Beneath The Remains alone, it\u2019s safe to say that Sepultura completely obliterate the significance of the dreadfully over-rated Reign In Blood leaving it choking on the dust of the mega-moshpit generated in homage of these two thrash classics. With the level of musicianship and talent on display, it\u2019s quite to believe that this was just their second album. The creepy intro gives way to an epic thrashout in the form of the excruciatingly brilliant gut-punch of a thrasher \u201cFrom The Past Comes The Storms\u201d. Hands down one of the best thrash metal songs ever and don't anybody else tell you otherwise. Don\u2019t even tell me to pick standouts on this one, there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019ll be able to do it. At first, hearing about a 7 minute instrumental immediately got my guard up. Hell, Metallica tried that with \u201cOrion\u201d and we all know how that turned out. However by the first listen itself, I was truly glad to discover how wrong I was. With eerie clean guitars parts and searing riffs along with some really psyched-out twists and turns in the realm of songwriting, \u201cInquisition Symphony\u201d is one of the best metal instrumentals period, even rivaling Metallica\u2019s \u201cThe Call Of The Ktulu\u201d which is no mean feat. Also who can forget the darker and more morbid feel of \u201cEscape To The Void\u201d and \u201cScreams Behind The Shadows\u201d providing a nice dose of variety, desperately craved in most other thrash metal albums out there. If you\u2019re looking for the more straightforward Bay Area inspired variant of thrash with a darker twist in general, \u201cSeptic Schizo\u201d and \u201cR.I.P (Rest In Pain)\u201d are sure to hit the spot for you and even the minute long \u201cThe Abyss\u201d fits in the album perfectly. Finally, what more can I say?? This is one heck of a nasty rotten thrash feast that absolutely no metal fan worth his/her salt should be without. \n\nThe searing guitar tone is raw as fuck but at the same time, avoids sounding like a chaotic wall of sound where you're barely able to differentiate between the notes. (cough*Dark Angel*cough). No worries of that happening here. In terms of sheer riff-craft and songwriting genius, this album arguably manages to surpass a lot of the classic bands at the time, namely Kreator, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax to name a few. Of course all of the bands had their share of classics back in the 80s and never-ending debates have ensued on that, but in terms of sheer viciousness and obliterating intensity, this album sends most of them right to the bottom of the totem pole. Okay maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration, but surely you get the drift. \n\nThe final verdict? THRASH TILL DEATH!!\n",
        "\nI'm going to choose to ignore the fact that Sepultura used to be a thrash metal band, since it seems that their roots become redundant somewhere between Arise and Chaos A.D, the latter of which remains their most famous album and disputably their best, depending who you ask. However, it's also disputably the moment that everything went horribly wrong for the Brazilians and they plunged into a sort of groove metal slump as characterized by the other big bands of the time, such as Pantera and White Zombie. I'm not here to tell you which story to believe, but I will say that I stand somewhere between those groups.\n\nChaos A.D. is not an album that lacks heaviness. It isn't heavy like thrash or death or sludge metal, but it delivers the heavies in more than one way. The first way is the one that you would usually consider most important on a metal album: the music is bold and loud and contains both memorable riffs and plenty of aggression. The overall style of those riffs is not really dominated by one particular metal subgenre, which may have thrown a lot of people off the scent in the past, getting titbits from many areas to create what I would say is an amalgam of all that was \"modern\" in 1993 without playing to the commercial. Remembering that this came out before nu metal, before Machine Head, and way before the NWOAHM is significant because this album could be seen as an influence on all of those, yet - and this is important to grasp - it is much more extreme. The sonic dirt of the production helps, as does the fact that the pace is higher than any of Pantera's work, while there are sections that move close to blastbeat territory or flat-out riffing, as one can hear on the closing 'Clenched Fist' and 'Propaganda', not to mention the latter half of the unfairly maligned 'Refuse/Resist'. Sure, 'Territory' grooves just like Pantera's 'No Good (Attack the Radical)', but that's the kind of groove metal that doesn't sacrifice either of those two words - it includes both groove and metal.\n\nThe second way in which Chaos A.D. is a heavy album comes from its atmosphere. Why Sepultura decided to record in Wales is a mystery, though the studio clearly did some good work, giving a grubby yet biting sound to Andreas Kisser's guitar and a clear if slightly floppy sound to Paulo Jr's bass. The drums are not quite as sharp as you might wish and a little distant, but there's a great ambience to the sound of the band together that feeds off the sinister themes of the amazing artwork (it really is one of the best covers I've seen) and sets songs like 'Amen' and 'We Who Are Not As Others' thrilling against the nerves, especially when Kisser plays those eerie high chords. I must say that I have never felt any atmosphere while listening to groove metal, nor do many of the 80s thrashers have much to boast in most cases. Here, 'Manifest' could easily have been a total throwaway track included to serve a political point, but the sense of unease I get while listening to the narrative and the backing instrumentation is very real and shows the band had grasped how to craft songs beyond mere surface details.\n\nThe other thing that adds to the quality of Chaos A.D. is the attention to detail, which is usually missing from any kind of music that aims to possess an instinctive appeal. I remember listening to this for the first time many years ago and shying away from it as something that was a bit ugly and oppressive: now I'm coming to realize that is exactly what made this good, since there are some songs that seem simple yet actually include plenty of changes to prevent them becoming too easy to digest. 'Propaganda' starts off as quite a fast-paced thrash song, slowing down in its second half and cutting away the guitars on occasions to expose the bass twisting and turning like a worm in the dirt. Then there's 'Amen', the middle section of which totally goes off the beaten track and plays out several intriguing instrumental ideas in succession. \n\nThere are a few cuts that don't make it in terms of quality and it's a big blow for the album that they come grouped together towards the end. 'Nomad' is a fairly nasty groove song with big lumpen riffs that don't do much for me; that's followed by the (basically) instrumental 'We Who Are Not As Others', which has atmosphere but not the riffs to sustain interest; 'Manifest' I have mentioned already as being a risk, while the cover of 'The Hunt' is passable but lacks the gravity that the rest of the album possesses. In general, I would praise the album as strong and heavier than most people think; influential, but not so much of a bold stride forwards as some would have you believe; classic, though not really excellent.\n",
        "\nAh yes one of Sepultura's albums that divided some fans, albeit not as many as Chaos AD did, but a decent amount. This album has the first signs of Sepultura incorporating groove elements into their music. It fits very well into the music and the people who hate this album seem to only like the most underground of underground metal. Yes, correct this album is slower than Beneath the Remains and Schizophrenia but it's very crushing and powerful. Beneath the Remains was extremely fast and consistent but the bigger budget in the production of Arise helped them get a more crushing sound (BTR was made for $8000 U.S dollars) as this album was made for $40,000; a budget five times larger. The album starts off with haunting tribal sounds in the opener \"Arise,\" the tribal sounds gradually keep building and keep building for 25 seconds and then boom the hammer smash of \"Arise\" starts off with very fast, frantic riffing, and assault rifle like drumming. No remorse or mercy is shown to the listener as this song consistently slays everything in its path. The next couple of tracks like \u201cDead Embryonic Cells,\u201d \u201cDesperate Cry,\u201d and \u201cAltered State\u201d feature slower passages with less emphasis on brutality and violence but more emphasis on groove and the feel of the song. It is groove but in a good way not in a bad way (Lamb of God, Hellyeah). \n\nThe production heavily reminds me of Metallica's And Justice for All album in the way that it's the band's fourth album and it has this very dry, scooped out mid sound to it. The band was on the verge of changing their sound and the production while suffocating is also pleasurable unlike AJFA which has a very thin sound to it and it is presented in a very unwelcoming approach in its production. This album features a heavier low end then their previous albums. Schizophrenia had a very strong low end but the production was very muddy and unstable, and BTR was more about frantic, high speed intensity then groove. The drumming displayed by Igor Cavalera incorporates tribal sounds, industrial sounds, heavy use of double bass, and very hard hitting snare drum attacks. On this album there is heavier use of experimentation than their previous albums and it incorporates far more use of different elements (industrial, tribal) which Sepultura would even further display in their later albums. The bass playing by Paulo is buried under Andreas' and Max's heavy guitar playing but he has some stand out moments (for example the solo in Subtraction). Max and Andreas made a great guitar duo with Andreas throwing in beautifully composed solos while Max would hold down the rhythms under the great soloing by Andreas. The riffing they made on this album and back in their early days was magical. They always performed to the best of their ability and they worked together like peanut butter and jelly. Unfortunately all good things come to an end and Max left the band for Soulfly. Sepultura to this day continues on in a very weak and lifeless direction.\n\nThe negatives about the album though are the filler songs. The first three tracks are some of the greatest Sepultura songs ever written being a turkey (bowling term for three strikes in a row), but then the weaknesses started showing. The song \u201cMurder\u201d is just a typical thrash song with nothing interesting going on and \u201cUnder Siege\u201d is just a boring song with very annoying vocal effects placed on Max's vocals. \u201cMeaningless Movements\u201d displays yet another generic thrash song. Other than that the standouts are the first three tracks, \u201cSubtraction,\u201d and \u201cAltered State\u201d with its tribal effects and great grooves. This album was featured in the book 1001 albums you must hear before you die (2006) so I insist as well as the book to hear this great album.\n",
        "\nWell, well, if it isn\u2019t Sepultura. Yes, this is the band that arguably led the march of early 90\u2019s thrash metal and less arguably led their own death march around the time the first reviews for Roots started coming in. As I\u2019m sure many will agree with me, Sepultura\u2019s releases after the resignation of founding member Max Cavalera can be described like so; a shaky half-step backwards, followed by a full-tilt backflip down a flight of stairs. As they swum in the waters of cat urine and razor blades that was Sepultura\u2019s 2000\u2019s releases, they occasionally rose to the surface now and again and spat out something halfway decent \u2013 a couple of songs from A-Lex had potential and I could have sworn there was that one good song from Dante XI. My early Sepultura fanboyism non-withstanding, the recent lineup are actually pretty good musicians and they can play the old classics live with the best of them, but it wasn\u2019t until 2011's Kairos when they finally escaped the harsh mediocrity that made up their writings of nearly 20 years of the bands existence. While still a little uninspired, Kairos was a step in the right direction. When the band announced a new album in 2012/13, I was interested to see if they\u2019d continue the same way, and by God was I pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe first thing to mention is that TMBHaHMBtH (needlessly long title aside) is a lot heavier than anything they\u2019ve done since Arise, and when I heard the opening riff to Trauma of War, I knew this album would be something to behold. Throwing aside the nu metal and plodding grooves of the last handful of albums, they go into full thrash-mode here, with a little death metal influence to give some added edge to their sound. Hell, there are numerous moments here that if you put Barney Greenway\u2019s vocals over them, you could convince me it\u2019s Napalm Death. The guitars riff at furious speeds, and the drums follow suit with an array of sick grooves and blasts. Here we also witness the outright best performances Derrick Green has ever recorded, as he belts out some seriously crushing screams that could compete with any A-list thrash/death band around. The whole of the first track is just brilliant and a fantastic starter for the album. There\u2019s some great drum embellishments here and there, nice guitar licks and a good song structure \u2013 it summarizes what makes thrash metal great. All killer, zero filler; complete fucking chaos. This beginning is far from a red herring either; the whole album continues the trend of sick sounding riffs, brutal drumming and ferocious vocals with no tolerance for bullshit.\n\nBeyond just the bludgeoning brutality that dominates this album, Sepultura show how creative they can be \u2013 for example in Tsunami, the song starts off with an intro that again, sounds like it could come from Napalm Death, and then goes into a kickass rhythmic barrage of brutality. I have no idea what time signature it\u2019s in (or if there\u2019s some polyrhythmic stuff going on), but it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it sounds WICKED. Age of the Atheist sounds a little more on the side of mid 90\u2019s Sepultura, with a bit of that tribal influence coming through, but it still sounds better than anything they\u2019ve put out since Against onwards. It\u2019s pretty short and probably the weakest song on the album, but still pretty good. Impending Doom has a couple of cheesy vocal lines, but the riffs make up for that in spades. There are some great solos thrown around the whole tracklist, and there are some weird recurring guitar effect that sounds like a delayed something-or-other. Whatever it is, it\u2019s all good, and although I would have preferred to hear a more diverse range of guitar effects, if they had to choose one recurring one that wasn\u2019t a bad one to choose.\n\nThe instrumentation itself is more skillful and technical than one might expect for a Sepultura album (let alone a MODERN one). As I\u2019ve mentioned many times, the drumming here is exquisite. Listen to just about any of these tracks and you\u2019ll see what I mean \u2013 thrashing and brutal, but with some cool and creative fills thrown in all over the place. It always fits what\u2019s happening in the song. The drummer knows when to go fast, when to slow down, when to just play the rhythm and when to throw in some variety. The guitar while more often than not is tremolo picking or grooving out sometimes tones it down and goes for a more moody approach like on Grief. Speaking of which, Derrick switches things up a bit on Grief and adds more of a melodic singing style. It borders on being a little whiny, but not so bad. It shows that Derrick can change things around when he wants to and give a little bit more of a dynamic edge, so far be it from me to complain.\n\nUnfortunately, this album isn't all gold and candy. I didn\u2019t want to have to talk about the production, but here we go \u2013 distorted, brick walled and poorly mixed. That\u2019s all I have to say. It really doesn\u2019t do justice to the album itself. I don\u2019t know who decided to make it sound this fucking disgusting, but whoever they are they should be barred from production by law, or preferably taken out back to \u201clook at the flowers\u201d Of Mice And Men style. It sounds like there\u2019s clipping and stuff going on all over the place like I\u2019ve never heard on a professionally produced album. It\u2019s one thing to say the bass is inaudible, but I think this kind of takes it to a new level of undermixed; or, more aptly, everything else being overmixed. There are very few times it rears its head from behind the wall of errant signals and distortion, and when it does it\u2019s almost always when the band is either playing at their quietest, or they\u2019ve stopped playing altogether. In a more general sense, it sounds like someone's taken sandpaper to the mixing desk and forcibly \u201croughing up the sound.\u201d Needless to say, it doesn\u2019t work. I\u2019ve never heard a great album made so hard to listen to by production this poor. News flash \u2013 you can make an album sound heavy and abrasive without making everything sound like garbage. Take a hint from The Black Dahlia Murder or something for Christ\u2019s sake. I mean, I could totally let it slide if it was a small time band making their first record, or one of a million poorly mixed black metal demo from the back end of buttfuck Norway (which sound more appealing, more often than not), but we\u2019re talking about a former legend here! If it weren\u2019t for the horrific production, this album would have been damn-near amazing. Despite this, I can still easily say it's the greatest thing of worth the band has produced since the 90's, which is certainly a big step up.\n\nAll in all, if Against and Nation were a fall from grace, this is the closest thing to Sepultura\u2019s redemption as we\u2019re going to get. They\u2019ve shown they can really write some killer tunes with some pretty sick ideas in there, and when they release their next album, we\u2019ll see if they can keep their momentum and deliver the pain again (and perhaps if they can hire an engineer who knows how to do their damn job). If they do, I think it\u2019ll be safe to say the Sepultura we know and love has returned \u2013 or at least, a different mutation of the same spirit. I guess we\u2019ll see if I should start tying the noose when the inevitable announcement comes, but I\u2019m vaguely optimistic that they can do it. That said, writing a non-album single called \u201cSepultura Under My Skin\u201d as a tribute to how good they are isn\u2019t a good sign. It\u2019s like watching someone who used to be cool pat themselves on the back in an awkward display of smug gloating bordering on limpwristed egowank, despite the fact they've done dick-all for the last 20 years. It\u2019s that sort of perverse self-congratulation doesn\u2019t exactly put my faith in them to keep the ball rolling. That and the song wasn\u2019t great either, so there\u2019s that.\n",
        "\nI have had a bone to pick with this fucking album since I was 16 years old. This album gets every pass in the world from metalheads for being so \u201craw\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201d Yup, it\u2019s definitely both those things, but it still sucks. If I had to pick just one album that\u2019s praise is entirely undeserved, \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d would be it.\n\nFirst things first: The music here is completely uninspired. Yeah, I said it. This shit sounds like a third rate Slayer clone tripped over a shitty Venom cover band. The lyrics are dumb as hell, but whatever. They were translated from Portuguese, so I\u2019m gonna let about 25% of my beef with them slide. The remaining 75% of my beef is about the subject matter. Seriously, how many generic songs about Satan and how poopy Christianity is do you assholes need? Here\u2019s a hint: not a whole album\u2019s worth. But that lack of originality and imagination in songwriting pales in comparison to the amateur hour musicianship here. \n\nI am at a complete loss to how Sepultura forgot to even tune their fucking instruments on this album. That\u2019s like the first lesson in Guitar Playing 101: Tune your fucking guitar. Like, what? No one started playing and though \u201cHey, this sounds like total ass\u2026what\u2019s up with that?\u201d And as much as Igor Cavalera would improve on later albums, his performance here suuuuuucks. It\u2019s like he thought that keeping on beat was more of a suggestion than a hard and fast rule of drumming. The vocals are, I don\u2019t know. Raw? Fuck it. I don\u2019t want to talk about the vocals. They\u2019re not that interesting. Also, I would talk about the bass, but I think they probably forgot to add it into the mix. It is literally almost entirely inaudible. \n\nAnd now, here to talk about what is inexplicably considered the crown jewel of \u201cMorbid Visions,\u201d me! Let\u2019s talk about the production. It\u2019s bad. Awful. Terrible. Grab a thesaurus and find more negative words, because it is the straight worst. It\u2019s so RAW, right? Like an evil tin can. The guitar tone is thin and squeaky and pretty grating all around, which is equal parts production and (again) forgetting to tune the fucking things. The most you can hear of the bass is a vague sense of a low end here and there. The drums sound like they\u2019re made of cardboard that\u2019s starting to get kind of wet from a leak in the roof of the cut-rate studio that obviously oversaw production of this album.\n\n\u201cMorbid Visions\u201d is a C- album that gets dragged way down by shitty production. It actually gets to a point where it\u2019s fucking punishing to listen to. It doesn\u2019t even point in the musical direction that Sepultura would be heading by the very next year with \u201cSchizophrenia.\u201d The ONLY redeeming quality this album has is that it isn't that long, so I didn't have to suffer too long re-listening to it to write this review. \n\nUnless you have a compulsion to listen to a band\u2019s complete discography, or are just kind of brain damaged, there is absolutely no reason to listen to this. Oh, you don\u2019t agree? Go ahead, then. Give it a good, solid, honest listen and tell me if there\u2019s really anything redeemable about \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d beyond it sounding \u201cevil.\u201d (There isn\u2019t. Basically all extreme metal sounds \u201cevil.\u201d You\u2019re an idiot.)\n",
        "\nWhen I came to the Sepultura page here on the Encyclopedia, I was absolutely appalled to see that this album had a rating of only 62%. I had no idea so many people hated this. I guess it should come as no surprise, because when any band even slightly changes their style, the metal world has an absolute meltdown. But I have loved this album dearly for many years, so when I saw this album's low rating, I decided it was necessary that I give this album the review in truly deserves.\n\nOne of the greatest things about Sepultura is Max and Andreas' incredible riff-writing skills, and this album has some of their best. The riffs are heavy, catchy, and while they may have some more groove to them than on previous albums, many of them are undeniably thrash. And the breakdowns on this record... holy shit, I have never wanted to mosh so hard in my life! While I will admit that the guitars are relatively simple here, that does not detract from their quality. There are dull moments occasionally, but only a very small number of them, and it certainly doesn't outweigh the incredible riffs in songs like \"Manifest\" and \"Propaganda\".\n\nAnother thing I love about this album is the slight implementations of Brazilian music into the songs. Of course, when they did this to a much larger extent on their album Roots, every metalhead in the world lost their fucking minds over it, and not in a good way. However, I adore it on this album, because they did it in a such a way that doesn't distract from the overall heaviness and catchiness of the album, but rather it adds to it. The occasional instance of Brazilian influenced playing on the record only makes it more unique. And who could forget the song \"Kaiowas\", a short, acoustic instrument piece with a clear tribal influence throughout? Again, Sepultura can throw in some major Brazilian influences without taking it overboard, and use it to write some phenomenal riffs.\n\nThis wouldn't even be a proper review of Chaos A.D. if I didn't talk about Igor's drumming. This album is his best performance yet, littered with catchy fills and technical beats throughout. The drums also do a great deal to add the Brazilian influence to the record, more so than any other instrument really. Overall, Igor Cavalera's drumming was at an apex on this record; whether the riff is a blazing fast one (think \"Biotech is Godzilla\") or a slower breakdown passage (\"Propaganda\"), Igor knows exactly how to play along and accentuate the riffing and vocals. Even the copious amounts of Chaos A.D. haters could not possibly deny the incredible performance of Igor Cavalera on the album.\n\nOverall, this album is fantastic through and through, and while it is not my favorite Sepultura album (that prestigious award belongs to Arise), it is certainly a close second. Chaos A.D. is a beautifully crafted masterpiece stocked full of catchy, speedy riffs, incredible drumming, and a certain uniqueness with an added Brazilian tribal influence. I can only hope that someday this album can overcome its ridiculous and undeserved stigma.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to heavy metal music, there seems to be a growing trend in the underground. That is, to criticize bands who choose to depart from the original sound they pioneered on earlier releases. I don't really like this at all, I think regardless of whether or not a band chooses to embrace a more classic rock stance on a death metal record or a more progressive rock stance on a doom metal record, the band can still be good if they execute this new sound properly. Unfortunately, it is for that very reason I have chosen to christen this review \"Wasted Potential\", because Sepultura had so much potential with this new sound they pioneered, regardless of the fact that I still think nu metal is the worst metal genre of all time.\n\nLets start off with what they did manage to do right on this record, shall we? First off, we have a unique experimentation with ambient, folk, and industrial sounds combined with groove metal that only Korn (as mediocre as I find both them and the entire genre of groove metal) was doing at the time. I myself am an avid fan of genres outside metal such as ambient, folk, and industrial, so when these elements were used on tracks such as \"Jasco\", \"Itsari\", and the uncredited \"Canyon Jam\", they became the highlight of this record; and while I myself may incorporate elements of ambient, folk, and industrial into the sound of my own metal band, Purple Haze, this is unfortunately where the good news ends.\n\nThe critics of this record mostly cite the fact that it is unoriginal as the reason to dislike it. In reality, this record is very original, and had a lot of potential. Saying the riffs on this record are indistinguishable from each other should be applied to metal records you do enjoy, or maybe a hardcore record, next time you choose to write a review. The songs sound like groove metal, so naturally they're all going to sound like groove metal stylistically. However, they aren't just groove metal, they're an even worse caricature of this already loathsome genre, i.e. \"nu metal\".\n\n\nThe fact that \"nu metal\" alone sounds like the way the would spell something in rap music immediately raises flags for the die-hard headbanger. While I don't necessarily mind the simplicity, there's no denying that your average metal elitist wants his riffs to be complex and demanding, and that's where this record fails. There's absolutely none of it here, and instead we are left with riffs that are more rhythmic in attack, and while rhythms can certainly be complex, the songs on this record are not demanding whatsoever riff-wise. Combine that with the strained, screamo rap vocals that themselves don't have any \"flow\", and you have the record titled \"Roots\", a terminology that within itself that has since become an insult to devoted headbangers AND hip-hop fans alike.\n\nLets face it; even Max admitted in an interview that the band completed two songs in less than a week, which usually means it wasn't well thought-out, and this record went on to sell 2 million copies, which sounds about right for a really big \"rock\" record at the time. Simultaneously, it spelled the end for metal as we knew it, and thanks to the metalcore bands continuing this style of music in a largely similar and just as atrocious way, this \"mallcore\" genre is coming up on its twentieth anniversary as the go-to genre for washed-up metal sellouts. The riffs would've been so much better if only they were more traditional groove metal, and the vocals are soulless, like a teenager screaming at his parents for not giving him an allowance. The singles \"Roots Bloody Roots\", \"Ratamahatta\", and \"Attitude\" do nothing to change the pace of the record, and only continue the aforementioned infractions in an even more commercially oriented direction (as is the point of writing a \"single\"). Avoid if possible.\n",
        "\nAfter finding huge success with Chaos A.D. and Roots, the band got in a bad habit of doing too much with their music. Mediocre Against, Nation, and Roorback predictably failed to impress the world, and the band was steadily losing its position as one of the greatest voices to represent the global South in a US/Europe-dominated heavy metal community. They were in serious need of going back to the basics to reset their minds, anchor themselves to a clear and simple concept, and make a concise statement of what they are all about. \n\nIn this context, writing music based on a classic literature was a brilliant decision - outsourcing the spinal concept of an album presented the band with a golden opportunity to take a step back and concentrate solely on fleshing out the music, while at the same time do it in a simple fashion (and do it well). Choosing Dante Alighieri\u2019s The Divine Comedy was equally crucial. With a literature that passed the test of time and written on a simple and archaic theme (it describes hell, purgatory, and heaven), it was going to guarantee familiarity for the listeners. \n\nNot having to worry about sewing together a thematic framework worked, and the music is a huge improvement compared to the past. The band really trimmed the fat with this set of songs - from entrance into hell in \u201cLost\u201d and exit from heaven in \u201cPremium Mobile\u201d and \u201cStill Flame\u201d, Dante XXI is very straightforward and only 39 minutes long, and it is their shortest album since Schizophrenia. Andreas Kisser in particular deserves credit in this regard. Like in Roorback, Andreas takes stylistic inspiration from hardcore and thrash, but this time no riffs overstay its welcome. His furious and precise chugs sound the most focused since he joined the band, showcased immediately with the first proper song \u201cDark Wood of Error\u201d (\u201cConvicted in Life\u201d, \u201cFalse\u201d, and \u201cCrown and Miter\u201d are some of the other highlights). Similarly, Igor Cavalera also sounds reinvigorated on his drums, packing more punch to his craft than he has in years - his relentless and meticulous use of bass drums across the entire album is greatly satisfying for fans of extreme metal, especially on the first two songs (not counting \u201cLost\u201d) where he, accompanying the guitar, sets the tone of the whole album. Although Paulo Jr.\u2019s bass contribution is usually minimal because he merely copies whatever Andreas plays, but even he is making his presence felt this time. His moments to shine are rare, like a brief interlude in \u201cNuclear Seven\u201d and intro to \u201cRepeating the Horror\u201d, but they are there. \n\nPast outcomes in Seputlura\u2019s attempts at converging diverse musical elements have been questionable, and they once again meddle with the same trickery here in Dante XXI. But they pull it off this time, borrowing wisely from Western classical music without compromising the commitment to keeping things simple. Cellos that announce the arrival into Purgatory (\u201cLimbo\u201d) and Heaven (\u201cEunoe\u201d) adds a medieval finesse and segments the album without compromising its overall momentum. The horns are also thrown in to engineer hellish and heavenly mood on \u201cFalse\u201d and \u201cCrown and Miter\u201d, respectively. Such additional instrumentations are not innovative by any stretch of the imagination, but they are the right cosmetic choice for enhancing the charm of this album. \n\nThe Divine Comedy also serves as an allegory to the band\u2019s struggles since the departure of charismatic and popular Max Cavalera in 1996. In one of his best vocal performance to date, Derrick Green triumphantly shouts \u201cThere is a way out! / It took a long time to get where we are / it wasn\u2019t easy but it never is / Big steps, keep moving on / I have my own two feet; don\u2019t need you to walk for me\u201d, as the band reaches heaven in \u201cCrown and Miter\u201d. This labored journey of musical ascent from hell to heaven is also a veiled statement of how there is no turning back for the band - despite the public demand, the days of pure thrash will never come back and neither will Max. Such a statement is not only brave but also convincing because, for the first time, the band is playing music in a way that compliments Derrick\u2019s vocal style. Sepultura's brand of fury is no longer primal, giving Derrick the right stage on which he can play to his vocal strengths and shine and no longer sounding like a failed replacement for Max. Sepultura is finally reborn with a new and convincing identity. \n\nFor the band, Dante XXI is a determined middle finger to the negative campaign against the band from US and elsewhere, and a welcome stake of claim to being one of the best bands from Latin America. 10 years since the release, the album still doesn't feel outdated, and the \u2018less-is-more\u2019 approach to the music and fighting spirit packed therein puts this album among the best in the band\u2019s career.\n",
        "\nSepultura is a band that have not only played in several metal genres, but had a great influence on them as well; namely black, thrash/death, groove, and nu metal respectively throughout their career. This particular release is the second in their trilogy of death-metal influenced thrash albums - Schizophrenia, Beneath the Remains, and Arise, all great in their own right. Compared to previous releases, \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d benefits from more sophisticated song writing and for the first time a cleaner, fuller production courtesy of famed Death Metal producer Scott Burns. The production is a little more sterile, less raw and less evil sounding than that of \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d or their black-metal tinged debut releases - \u201cBeastial Devastation\u201d and \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d, but is still wicked heavy and far more professional. Each instrument is now clear and discernible, and lacks the dirtiness and fuzz of previous releases. Paulo Jr.'s bass could be louder in the mix, but it is passable. Paulo for the most part holds down the fort by following the rhythm guitar, but sometimes throws in a few surprises, such as the concluding bass solo on \u201cStronger than Hate\u201d. The drums are now massive sounding and prominent in the mix. Drummer Igor Cavalera around this time has been more or less a very no gimmicks \u201cmeat-and-potatoes\u201d thrash drummer - pounding the skins like a madman with absolute precision, offering volatile blast beats and slower grooving sections that are never too simple, and never too showy. Max's vocals are gruff and deep as ever, retaining the borderline death-metal grunt of previous releases, but this time is more down-to-earth and less preoccupied with sounding \u201cevil\u201d. Although their English is still somewhat broken, the lyrics are still pretty decent, with imagery dealing with post-apocalyptic matters, war, and oppression.\n\n\u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d picks up in similar fashion where \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d left off \u2013 unleashing a relentless maelstrom of frenetic thrash riffs upon the listener. Although \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d was sometimes a more straightforward blistering thrash-fest with downright evil guitar work, I feel B.T.R. is where the band truly hit their creative peak as the album houses the most memorable and complex songwriting of anything they, or really most band at the time, have released before or after.\n\n\u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d is an album that binds sheer thrash brutality with a stunning display of top notch musicianship. Many points of the album reaches a level of complexity without ever diving into progressive metal territory; and despite the relatively heightened technicality of the guitar-work, at the end of the day they are still an unadulterated thrash band. At the time of this release, Sepultura were a band that were not afraid to show the world that they were just that. Unapologetically fast and vicious as it is virtuosic, \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d make no mistake of this. Do not expect catchy choruses, simplistic sing-along lyrics, or sappy \u201cemotional\u201d ballads.\n\nDo, however, expect a mega shit-ton of riffs. Every song is bursting with a complex battery of riffs, each unique, greatly varied, and technically crafted; patched together by occasional and brief flashes of epic, quasi-melodic passages. Most of the riffs anticipate and work with the next, building off one another - creating a chaotic, yet calculated ebb-and-flow of spastic and unpredictable tempo and rhythm changes that carry each song.\n\nDon't get me wrong, although there are slower parts of relatively mid-paced chugging riffs and melodic sections strategically placed here and there, the tremolo-picked, hyper fast death-thrash mayhem is plenty. But even when the tempos are temporarily slowed down, it is still effective and heavy as hell, and they never lose track of the fact that they are indeed a thrash band. The best example of this would be the fan-favorite \u201cInner Self\u201d, where the obsessive, mid-paced palm-muting in the introductory sections eventually build into a blisteringly fast and somewhat punkish chorus.\n\nTechnical as they are memorable, every solo is powerful and masterfully crafted. Lead guitarist Andreas Kisser often foils Max's relentless riffage and surging rhythms with layered harmonic backdrops. The opening parts of the title track, \u201cStronger than Hate\u201d and \u201cSarcastic Existence\u201d, as well as the rather beautiful bridge/solo section of \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d are possibly the best examples of this. Andreas even sometimes employs the occasional use of clean guitar parts \u2013 never overused. The only really prominent display of the clean guitar is in the opening of the title track, which sounds like a more elaborate version of Metallica's \u201cCall of Ktulu\u201d.\n\n\u201cSarcastic Existence\u201d switches things up, featuring many unusual sounding and dissonant riffs, meter changes, an extended bridge in the middle of the song, and somewhat of a swinging introductory drum section. \u201cSlaves of Pain\u201d is one of my favorite tracks; having distinct, shredding riffs and a rather upbeat chorus. The last three tracks \u201cLobotomy\u201d, \u201cHungry\u201d, and \u201cPrimitive Future\u201d while not as memorable as the first six tracks, are still excellent.\n\nMany consider this release to be one of the greatest the thrash genre has to offer \u2013 a culmination where velocity, brutality, heaviness, technical proficiency and maturity merge into one bonafide masterpiece. \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d was released near the end of thrash's peak in 1989, shortly before the genre's relative downfall. Fortunately, the band managed to squeeze out one last thrash classic before succumbing to the alternative-metal trends of the 90's \u2013 their brutal masterwork \u201cArise\u201d.\n",
        "\nOK, let's get the obvious out of the way first. ATTENTION INTERNET: Max has left the building. Actually, he left a while ago, and he's still not coming back. The vitriol spewed towards Sepultura ever since Max departed, of his own choosing I might add, is something I still don't understand. Yes, there are some really bad albums in the post-Max catalog, namely their first two attempts, but some of the remaining music is actually pretty good, if not instantly recognizable as Sepultura. It seems people just want - wait for it - Max to come back and release Arise 2. Which of course is not happening. At this point I've decided to file the continued complaints away as evidence of an anti-metal conspiracy among former Megadeth, Metallica, and Sepultura listeners. Regardless, Sepultura is a Cavalera-free operation now, and the results are starting to go somewhere. \n\nOh, for the record? Napalm Death. Zero original members. Food for thought.\n\nThe journey to Kairos began with Roorback in 2003. While still all over the place in terms of quality, Roorback started to show flashes of getting past the more tribal nonsense permeating Against and Nation. Unfortunately they lost their momentum with a diversion into concept albums which weren't all bad in and of themselves (A-Lex is pretty amusing if you're a Burgess fan) but weren't the real progression I'd been waiting for. And that brings us to Kairos.\n\nRight off the bat, opener Spectrum indicates that this will in fact be a more traditional thrash-influenced metal album, the track featuring some solid if unspectacular lead work by Andreas as well. This isn't Arise-type thrash with latent death metal influences, but more of a groovy, mid-tempo thrash-influenced sound. I know! This is like Sepultura's Youthanasia; pace reduced, riffs still present. The underlying groove continues throughout the first five songs (not the first five tracks, mind you, #4 is an interlude thing that'll be addressed later). I'm not sure if the jump to Nuclear Blast impacted their production budget, but everything here is solid on that front. \n\nThe first standout track is Relentless. OK, the \"I'm relentless...\" bits are a bit on the cheesier side, but there's catchiness present, a bit of head-nodding inspiration. Plus, there's a dead-cool dual lead section, and a bit in the latter half of the song with a lead segueing into a clean guitar bit that's one of the better moments on the album. Dialog also deserves mention as one of those tracks that seems a bit odd at first listen but does grow on you, spoken word parts and all.\n\nAfter Dialog, we undergo acceleration into something closer to traditional thrash. Until the album closer (and again ignoring the interludes), tempos pick up and things get a bit more aggressive. There's still a decent amount of groove floating around in places as well. The riff in Mask at around 2:38 is one of the better riffs on the entire album. In fact, if Mask was the opener, the album might've been better received overall.\n\nThe closing non-cover track, Structure Violence (Azzes), is an interesting collaboration with percussionists Les Tambours du Bronx. It's the closest thing to any sort of tribal influence found on the album, and the lack of overwhelming tribal influences elsewhere on the disc may make it more palatable. It's an interesting track, best described as a more developed version of We Who Are Not As Others from Chaos A.D.\n\nAt this point, it would seem that we've got a pretty solid album on our hands. In truth it is mostly solid, but it still isn't up to par with the past catalog. A major negative is some of the vocals. Not the performance; Derrick Green's vocal style may not be the thing for everyone, but he fits just fine here. OK, the dude's not a \"vocalist\" in the Dickinson or Ripper sense; he's more of a limited-range type. But it works. Hell, nobody's screaming that Tom Araya needs replacing because he can't sing. That being said, some of the lyrical work is acutely sub-par. A prime example: the chorus to Mask is repetitive, uninspired, and boring. If you fixed the chorus to Mask and the problems with Relentless I mentioned previously, you'd be getting somewhere. Unfortunately those elements are not restricted to just two tracks.\n\nFurthermore, the four instrumental tracks are mostly ignorable, as are the two covers. The former are unrequired and serve to break up the listening experience in irritating fashion, and the latter...well, they're technically not bad, I just could care less about the original composers and so don't bother with them.\n\nThis brings us to the elephant in the room. The biggest fault of the album as a whole is that, while technically diverse, too many of the riffs seem repetitive or similar. A further damning indictment is that while I can hear in my head, hum, etc. a given riff off of Arise or Beneath the Remains, the majority of the riffs here are forgettable. They're executed with a precision worthy of musicians with their experience, but something is missing to take everything over the top.\n\nYou know what? I think I figured out the problem. Something is missing from the equation here, but what may come as a surprise is that it's not a vocalist change. Frankly, Sepultura is in bad need of a second guitarist. Someone who can challenge Andreas musically and help fine-tune some of the band's riff-writing. It's too bad they didn't think to try recruiting Kiko Loureiro at some point, someone of his caliber is just what is required here. You have to wonder how much of Andreas's writing is constrained by the fact that he knows he'll be the main guitarist performing the tracks live, token appearances by Derrick Green as a second axe-man notwithstanding.\n\nSo, there you have it. If nothing else, Kairos is proof that Sepultura can both be viable in a post-Cavalera existence and turn out a solid release. Despite the fact that a lot of the guitar work isn't going to get stuck in your head the album is still a good listen overall. You might not remember a lot of it a few hours later, but while it's playing there's not that much to poke at. Plus, if you go digital, you can fix the experience somewhat by removing the interludes and the covers. I say it rates 7 out of 10, so a 70% seems about right here. Better guitar work and culling some of the unrequired elements would've easily stuck it in the low 80s; the overall package has that kind of potential.\n",
        "\nEven though I'm only familiar with a few of the post-Cavalera Sepultura albums, I have to assume Nation is the absolute nadir of the band's output; I refuse to believe the band could have made something worse than this. I can't help but feel this is what Chaos A.D. sounds like to one of that album's detractors, that being a load of oversimplified, stupid and monotone noise that can't convey anything meaningful in a convincing way. This album is appalling; it's not incompetently performed but the band manages not to play anything inspired or ear-grabbing for its entire duration.\n\nFrom start to finish this is a groove metal/hardcore album with a lot of influence from nu metal. Groove and hardcore influence isn't a bad thing in Sepultura's case, with the band having used it to great effect on Chaos A.D. but here they completely miss what made that album work. What ultimately ruins this album is that while this goes for a stripped down, simplistic punk approach like Chaos A.D there is a distinct lack of passion and inspiration here, with every performance and every song coming across like loud noise made for the sake of making noise. The riffs are one such example - they are a series of very simple, droning grooves with some reliance on more rock-ish chord strums and chugs for some of the slower passages throughout the album. Every last bit of guitarwork on the album is boring, stale and unmemorable; this isn't helped by the overly slick, clean and evenly tracked guitar tone here which renders all the guitarwork sterile and lifeless. These ultimately drive the songs and as they're so played out and tired-sounding the songs end up being that as well.\n\nThe other performances aren't anything to write home about either - the drumming is mostly unremarkable save for some more tribal music-inspired fills here and there; only here it seems horribly out of place as the rest of the music is so dumb and lacking in anything interesting they don't match up to what the rest of the band is doing at all. The vocals are similar to the guitars, being loud for the sake of loud and conveying no aggression at all. Derrick Green's unchanging and monotone hardcore barks sound entirely passionless and unaggressive, with his voice coming across like a load of grating noise that ultimately means and accomplishes nothing as a result. The singing he does during the music\u2019s softer moments isn't technically bad but again, conveys no emotion at all and feels contrived when used in music that shoots for tough guy angst.\n\nThe songs are uniformly redundant and aimless, with the band content to operate at one tempo and coast on one idea for the majority of a song with no change-ups to speak of. A majority of this album operates on mid-tempo grooving with a lot of focus on the big, simple messages in the lyrics and the equally big, simple grooves underneath the vocals. This is a problem when the grooves aren't hard-hitting or catchy at all and the lyrics, as simple as they are, are delivered so unconvincingly that they don't stick even after repeated listens, with their repetitious and simplistic nature only serving to be yet another idea that can be aimlessly recycled throughout a song. Any changes there may be usually don't pan out well; slower, chugging moments like the verses of 'Border Wars' are totally boring, the various acoustic guitar passages here are as aimless and repetitive as everything else here, annoying distortion filters only make Derrick's voice sound even weaker, and the string-laden closer 'Valtio' sounds melodramatic and once again leads to nothing. The lone fast numbers here 'Revolt' and 'Human Cause' are a pair of sub-minute crossover thrash songs that despite implying so much aggression still don't leave any sort of impact, falling far short of 'Biotech is Godzilla' or even 'Dictatorshit'. The politically charged lyrics on display throughout the album come across more as obvious preaching; even if you agree with the message the vocals are delivered so unconvincingly a listener would not want to be on board with them. \n\nThe passionless and uninspired performances are to blame for all of this album's failings, as in a similar fashion to punk rock music as simple as this needs to be backed with attitude, fire and vigour to have any impact, else it comes across as contrived and meaningless. The boring and redundant songs only further dampen the impact and make the music come across like effortless drivel, which only makes it get on the listener's nerves as the music doesn't inspire any real emotion beyond irritation that the band are still riding whatever dumb idea they had with no end in sight. This is a stupid album; it's 50 or so minutes of noisy angst that never amounts to anything but that. It doesn't hit hard like anything off Chaos A.D., instead the band simply put forth the music in a mechanical and lifeless fashion, akin to a propaganda speaker. It's full of nothing but irritating music that's devoid of any truly effective ideas, and even breaking it down into its constituent parts doesn't yield so much as a single good riff or vocal performance, let alone a tolerable passage. This is pointless and annoying music, don't bother with it.\n",
        "\nChaos A.D. was a successful experiment for Sepultura - their stripped down, blunt groove metal/hardcore style on that album was highly distinctive for the time and extremely effective even today. What they did afterwards on Roots can perhaps be seen as the logical conclusion of what was being done to their music on Chaos A.D., as the band take the ethos, feel and atmosphere of that release to an endpoint on this. However, this time their experimentation resulted in this catastrophic failure - Roots was at the time their worst release, being a tedious and dull effort with little to redeem it and a sharp decline from what came before.\n\nKicking things off is the title track 'Roots Bloody Roots' which is honestly a great track, featuring a hypnotic groove to both the massive droning guitar riffs and the pounding drums that is impossible to forget. Max's vocals are an even more blunt and distorted bark than on Chaos A.D.; it works well here when teamed with the inimitable chorus and the similarly stripped down, powerful verses. It's easily the best song here and the greatest example of what the band shoot for on the album - a monolithic, layered, textured, stripped down and dense take on nu metal with tribal inflections through the drumming and some of the instruments used, along with mantra-like socially conscious lyrics and a similarly simplified, shouted/barked vocal delivery. This direction continues the trends seen on Chaos A.D. (simplifying the riffs to favour texture, layers and percussive heaviness, tribal music influence, more active drumming, more socially conscious and simplified lyrics along with a greater focus on slogan-like verses and choruses, and a more blunt vocal delivery) but the problem is the band went so far with simplifying the music\u2019s focus that there is no way to really vary one track from another the next. The music is by design focused on simplicity in its riffs and lyrics and mid-tempo, crushing heaviness, and these ideas are all presented at their strongest on the opening song. \n\nOf the remaining 69 minutes of this thing most of it is devoted to re-stating the title track's formula which makes that sound feel staler and more played-out with each minute that passes. Even Korn, a key inspiration for the music here, had enough going on to stay interesting throughout its run-time. Unlike that album there isn\u2019t any real variation in feel to the music as the band here only shoots for a mid-tempo crush based on fat, layered grooves, the vocals aren\u2019t varied in tone or style, and there isn\u2019t much else intersting going like any particularly interesting bass work. This becomes immediately apparent as the next few songs after the opener start playing, and it remains this way for most of the tracklist - a lot of the material here are just \u2018Roots Bloody Roots\u2019 style songs that are worse in every way; worse riffs, more repetitive and stupid lyrics and less catchy hooks and most notably, piss poor vocal performances. Max's vocals on nearly every track after the opener sound god-awful; his raspy and screechy shout only becomes more grating as the album wears on, with numerous tracks featuring hideous screeching from him that are disgusting to the ear. Compounding his monotone delivery are the uniformly repetitive lyrics that have him repeating one line over and over in this awful voice, along with various distortion filters that only make him sound even worse. There are other annoying ideas here like assorted bits of aimless noise made by farting around on the bass or guitars or adding effects in post-production (like most of 'Straighthate' or the end of 'Born Stubborn'.) \n\nThere are some attempts at varying this formula or dispensing with it completely but none really work at all; 'Ratamahatta' features tribal percussion and a distinctive groove that works quite well, but the absurd scat vocals and Max's increasingly grating shouts on top of it make for a totally irredeemable song. 'Breed Apart' mixes it up with some low spoken word and more tribal percussion at the start before morphing into the same boring sludge that dominates most of this album. 'Lookaway' is the point on the where this release stops feeling like an earnest experiment and like a genuine trend-hop, with record scratching from DJ Lethal opening up the worst song on the album. The first half of this song is taken up by a one-note slow groove that gets tiresome very quickly, and Max's performance here is excruciating with an annoying distortion filter being on his voice throughout, alternating between boring spoken word verses and a hideous screamed chorus. Mike Patton does backing vocals and only serves to make the vocal performance even more noisy and unpleasant. The entire thing then breaks down into an ambient part with Jonathan Davis delivering scat vocals; this part is boring but at least that tiresome groove and the hideous vocals from before have stopped by this point. The successive tribal interludes 'Jasco' and 'Its\u00e1ri' aren't awful; not nearly as interesting as 'Kaiowas' on Chaos A.D. but they do provide a much needed break from the monotony the band continually serves on this album. The 13 minute tribal jam session tacked on the end isn't bad either once it gets going after the first six minutes, with assorted tribal percussion instruments making for an increasingly intense passage that finishes the album off.\n\nEven the songs that are musically decent are ruined by the vocals like 'Spit' or 'Dusted'; the only song that really manages to overcome them is 'Dictatorshit'. It's a sub-90 second crossover thrash song with a few good riffs in there, and while the vocals kind of suck they work with a faster song like this one. The drumming is the only other positive aspect here - music this undemanding doesn't need very complex drumming but Igor still spices it up with numerous patterns and fills in a good few tracks here and he hits hard throughout. Outside of this though, Roots is a failure - the band found a specific sound and decided it was good enough to run with for an entire album, when really they didn\u2019t have enough good ideas to make 72 minutes of music. The ideas that work on the title track get staler and staler as the album wears on as the band don't execute them as well as they did on that song, and any new ideas they throw in only make the music worse as they weren't good to begin with. Even the production that helped the title track gets old fast; the guitars are so fat and bassy the riffs start to blend together into a never-ending stream of sludge.\n\nFinding 'Roots Bloody Roots' as a single (and not listening to the b-sides) will get you the only truly worthwhile material here - it may feature the same ideas that make the rest of this album so monotonous but they sound fresher on this song due to it being the song that introduces them as well as being better executed. Other than this Roots is a gigantic waste of time and talent, as well as marking the start of a long string of boring releases from Sepultura with Derrick Green at the helm and being the spiritual antecedent to Soulfly.\n",
        "\nRiffs.\n\nThis album would be boring and generic (today, anyway), without so many great riffs. Less raw Sepultura\u2019s previous album, Morbid Visions, and not as well-known as its followup, Beneath the Remains, Schizophrenia is a short, punishing piece of Brazilian death/thrash. The band has had other albums achieve more popularity \u2013 may that be the positive attention garnered by Beneath the Remains, or negative, as in Chaos AD and Roots. This leaves Schizophrenia as one of the band\u2019s favored albums, but not the best necessarily liked.\n\nSchizophrenia unleashes a storm of furious, constantly changing riffs upon the listener. In fact, I have only one complaint about the riffs: the last one on the album, not necessarily better than the others, but one with a different guitar tone, is played only once! What a waste \u2013 there\u2019s no telling what they could have accomplished with more of this type of variation. In addition to good soloing, the drummer is decent; he keeps up. The toms have a somewhat irritating, distinctive sound -- when I can\u2019t tell the difference between early Sepultura and Slayer, that\u2019s something I listen for. The bass is difficult to hear, but it\u2019s there. Overall, the songs are consistent, assaulting, and fast, with the occasional acoustic interlude (beginning of Inquisition Symphony and the Abyss). The vocals, while they are bearable and fit the music well, don't do anything to improve it. \n\nInquisition Symphony is the obvious standout here. Unrestricted by Cavalera\u2019s aforementioned mediocre grunted/barked vocals, the instrumentalists are allowed to shine. It demonstrates what the album is all about while rising above it. It\u2019s unpredictable, exploding with amazing riffs, and it\u2019s completely insane. The ominous acoustic guitar at the beginning that returns interwoven into the chaotic ending is a good touch, and it's overall representative of this album and early Sepultura's appeal as a whole.\n\nWhile my major complaint, that the songs sound too similar to each other, still stands, this is classic early death/thrash. Short, sweet, and brutal, Sepultura has crafted a hell of a riff-fest.\n",
        "\nThe Sepultura unleashed yet another album, crushing any and all who dared cross its path. That album is the critically acclaimed \"Beneath the Remains\", which is more or less Sepultura's best effort. It's very easy to see why many would consider it to be their all-time favorite, it's cos it's got the anger and aggression that the earlier albums had, but the sound is more refined than ever. The only album that would ever compete with the might of this one would be \"Arise\", released sometime later. \"Morbid Visions\" would be where Sepultura began, \"Schizophrenia\" would be where they refined their sound, and \"Beneath the Remains\" would be where they would solidify it. Let's dive down \"Beneath the Remains\".\n\nYep, it's that aggressive sound from \"Schizophrenia\" again, except there's quite a few changes, the production quality being one of the most notable. Everything seems to be more crisp and clean as opposed to the first two releases. There's no more plastic bucket drumming, no grainy, old headphone-like vocals, and no buzzing guitars. With this clean production quality, Sepultura can finally convey their aggression and style, using songs like \"Mass Hypnosis\" that contain instances of a blindingly fast pace, without any difficulty. While we're on the subject of the band's style, we're totally used to Sepultura using stuttering e-note rhythms at this point. Even when every song on here uses it, the band makes up for it by using more unusual and unconventional chord patterns that create a frightening and abrasive sound. It's something that we've heard quite a bit on \"Schizophrenia\", but they're more prevalent on this album. Like I said, it's that sound that solidifies Sepultura as a perfectly legitimate thrash metal band and not just another Slayer wannabe.\n\nOf course Sepultura is no stranger to using more than one tempo in each of their songs, it's practically a requirement for all thrash metal bands that at least want to sound good. In some instances, however, they can be kinda slow. One part of \"Sarcastic Existence\", for example, kinda has a slow, lurching pace, but it doesn't sound bad at all when paired up with a more sinister lick. This creates a very dark and disturbing atmosphere, and is also a break from all the breakneck speed that dominates the album. Although it's not all plodding like previously mentioned song, \"Inner Self\" is slightly slower than most of the other tracks when it's at its fastest, yet it still maintains the speed needed for most thrash metal songs. It, like \"Sarcastic Existence\" has also got its slow part, and that's mostly during the verses. If most other thrash metal band around at the time wrote that song, chances are that their songs would be nothing but an extremely fast tempo all the way through, maybe with or without with the occasional different tempo thrown in. Sepultura would use much more than just that one tempo for each song, thus giving us more of a progressive element in their music. \n\nSepultura is proof that a band from Brazil could have as much potential as one from Germany or the US. Their souped up Slayer-style metal made them a few of the catalysts for death metal's reign of the underground in the 90's. It's easy to see why, since \"Beneath the Remains\" contains not only the anger found in all of thrash metal, but also the spirit of more determined musicians. The band would release one more opus, \"Arise\", and after that, let's just say not much good came out of them. It's a shame, really, 'cos the band went the way of Metallica. At least they had no plans of joining forces with any classic rocker to produce a concept album, 'cos that would predictably bomb hard.\n",
        "\nIn 1991-1994 Sepultura was at the height of their power and popularity. It is therefore not very surprising that their then-label Roadrunner Records sought to capitalize on their success after years of heavy touring and recording. In the wake of DVDs in the early 2000s the label re-issued the band\u2019s previous VHS \u201cUnder Siege\u201d and the then-brand new \u201cWe Are What We Are\u201d (compiling the \u201cRoots\u201d music videos) together with a pseudo-documentary and live recordings under the uncreative moniker \u201cChaos DVD\u201d.\n\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice is exactly how crappy and cheaply made the entire package is. The DVD is split into three different sections: there\u2019s the \u201cUnder Siege (Live in Barcelona)\u201d recording from the \u201cArise\u201d world tour, the \u201cThird World Chaos\u201d video from the \u201cChaos AD\u201d world tour and finally the \u201cWe Are What We Are\u201d video from the \u201cRoots\u201d era, featuring all three videos of that album. The \u201cUnder Siege (Live In Barcelona)\u201d segment is the most worthwhile, as it features an entire live show from the mammoth \u201cArise\u201d world tour, interspersed with short interview bits. It is unfortunate that these interview bits can't be skipped (or viewed in their entirety) as the live show is what most fans will shell out hard currency for. Likewise had these interview parts better be given their own separate chapter. This way both interests would have been served simultaneously. Nevertheless this is the only really worthwhile segment of the three present on this DVD. That is less than half of the DVDs content, which is a sad state of affairs considering Sepultura were one the label\u2019s biggest sellers back in the day. \n\n\u201cThird World Chaos\u201d is the most widely known video release of the band, and the way it is amateurishly cut and edited speaks volumes just how skewed metal DVDs generally are put together. It is the usual jumble of random live recordings with uninteresting backstage videos, the band goofing off/being drunk, TV interviews and on-the-road footage spliced together with all of the band\u2019s music videos up to \u201cChaos AD\u201d. The audio and video quality varies heavily from section to section, and there\u2019s no flow (besides chronology) to the whole. That it spents extended time on a scatological joke is the least of its problems, which run far deeper than juvenile humor. It starts off with the band\u2019s then-most recent material and works it way back to the days of \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d, their breakthrough record for the label. Sepultura\u2019s stint with Cugomelo Records is ignored entirely. That is understandable in a way, but Roadrunner had already re-issued the often ignored \u201cMorbid Visions/Bestial Devastation\u201d and \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d albums by this time, which gives them no good excuse to ignore that part of the band\u2019s early history. There\u2019s no possibility to choose and play separate chapters, or only the promo videos \u2013 which begs the question why this was released on DVD format in the first place. That it wasn\u2019t possible in its original incarnation was forgivable, as that was on the dying VHS format. Being reissued later on DVD, it is a headscratcher why Roadrunner Records didn\u2019t bother with chapters for each segment. This would have made the disc more interesting and functional in the long run. As it exists today it a half-hearted and corner-cutting attempt to squeeze more money out of the band\u2019s existing fanbase. \n\nThe segment opens with the encore songs of the Donington show, which is a bit puzzling. Sure, it was a memorable show with relatively high production values and stage design, plus when the band destroyed their instruments at the end, it made for a memorable finale. However, the Donington show was filmed in its entirety, and while it can be argued that not all footage is of the desired quality. An abbreviated cut of this show could have made everybody happy. Now we just are left with a Mot\u00f6rhead cover, a quick Titas cover rendition and the band\u2019s destruction of the stage. All in all fairly pointless and inconsequential stuff considering the wealth of material present in the band\u2019s personal archives. It isn\u2019t representative for Sepultura, or its discography and actually shortsells them in many ways. The opening section sets the tone for the rest of the documentary: corners are cut, history is selectively ignored and subjects that could have added some substance are only mentioned in passing. \u201cThird World Chaos\u201d simply doesn\u2019t do the band the justice it deserved. \u201cChaos AD\u201d might have been the band\u2019s creative death certificate, even they didn\u2019t deserve a limp eulogy like this. \n\nAs Sepultura was a formidable live act you\u2019d be hardpressed to actually notice that from this DVD. There\u2019s no unedited, full-blown live recording to be found here, but truncated edits of the group\u2019s show at Donington, UK in 1994. Granted, the recordings of that Donington show weren\u2019t exactly stellar, but to edit it down to merely a Mot\u00f6rhead and Titas cover is just selling the band short. The show focused heavily on \u201cChaos AD\u201d, arguably Sepultura\u2019s most enduring and popular but creatively empty record \u2013 but it did contain it fair share of early classics. The same could be said of the band\u2019s appearance at Finland\u2019s Giants Of Rock from 1991, which is only briefly mentioned in archive footage of the \u201cArise\u201d period. Overall, there was a wealth of live footage to mine from, and Roadrunner decided to go for this pseudo-documentary and promo video compilation instead? Why? Granted the DVD, especially the \u201cThird World Chaos\u201d segment, is an easy view. Mostly because it never dwells on any given subject for an extended period of time. Which is positive for more casual fans of the band, but leaves long-time supporters on their hunger. Nothing is explored beyond the superficial (very fitting for the dreadful \u201cChaos AD\u201d era, and what it stood for), and the most interesting eras of the band\u2019s history are skipped over for easy entertainment and uninteresting backstage footage. \n\nIt is also completely selectively blind to the band\u2019s early history. Early lead guitarist Jairo Guedz Braga is only briefly mentioned in one of the many interview soundbytes, and there are no mentions of original singer Wagner Lamournier, or session keyboardist Henrique Portugal. The entire early history of the band is in fact skipped over. It would have been interesting to see home video material from the \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d, \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d and \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d days. Even if it was only a crude rehearsal, outtakes from the band\u2019s early local shows or interviews with early supporters and former band members. None of this is present. A segment about the recordings of \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d and especially \u201cArise\u201d (when the band holed up in death metal mecca Morrisound in Tampa, Florida) could have added such tremendous depth to this shallow money-grabbing exercise. Neither of these are accounted for, and only mentioned in passing. Everybody knows that Sepultura were one of the most potent death/thrash units of their day. As the \u201890s set in change was inevitable for the Brazilians. Largely abandoning their riff-based thrash formula of old, \u201cChaos AD\u201d heralded an era of musical simplification and a reliance on groove. We\u2019ll never known what transpired within the band to initiate such a dramatic turnover in style, but it was successful at least financially for the band, who now played bigger touring slots and festivals. Popularity and musical merit aren\u2019t to be conflated, or considered equal. \n\nThe third and final \u201cWe Are What We Are\u201d segment is culled from the then-new \u201cRoots\u201d period and its subsequent fallout. It compiles the band\u2019s three music videos that were shot to promote the album. All three are interesting in their own ways, especially \u2018Rattamahatta\u2019. Not so much musically, but for the fact that it was the band\u2019s only foray into stop-motion animation. The segment is incredibly short, with a fairly pointless introduction by the band after which all three videos follow back to back. The album is its own brand of awful, and the promotional videos show the band\u2019s further regression into mediocrity and irrelevance. That the band imploded at the height of its commercial success is a reminder that even the most promising of bands can falter dramatically. \n\nIn all \u201cChaos DVD\u201d is indeed chaotic (and not in a good way). It is an unorganized mess of a compilation, of which only the \u201cUnder Siege (Live in Barcelona)\u201d part is worth repeated viewings. The remainder of it is crudely sewn together cuts of brief interview bits, backstage footage and the occasional festival recording. In between those the band\u2019s promotional clips are strewn in order to give it some semblance of coherence and chronology. On its face it appears to be a fan-package, but on closer inspection it is anything but. It is shallow and superficial mess that focuses on unimportant trivialities and ignores the impact and importance, both domestic and abroad, of the band\u2019s pre-\u201cChaos AD\u201d era. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise as Roadrunner Records was clearing its artist roster of its commendable death metal past around this time to welcome the widely (and rightly) despised nu-metal movement. Few of the older bands were to remain with the imprint, most notably Fear Factory, Machine Head and Sepultura were able to keep their contracts \u2013 but at a severe cost. \u201cChaos DVD\u201d is an epitaph for both band and label as each would go through its own set of changes. It\u2019s functional for what it is, but hardly commendable for anybody looking for substance and worthwhile content.\n\nReview originally written for Least Worst Option - www.leastworstoption.com\n",
        "\nFor many folks out there, the 90s were a very treacherous time in the metallic world. Thrash was fading away, shred had all but a year's worth of legitimacy, and something new was a'brewin' in the Pacific Northwest. Metal as they knew it was leaving the mainstream spotlight in favor of the \"next big thing\" rearing its ugly head(s) as the years wore on and certain groups who still wished to hold onto their place within the A-List spectrum had to do something Adapt or die, after all. Yet none really fell right on their fucking face with it than our one-time favorite Brazilian troublemakers Sepultura with a little thing called \"Roots\"...\n\nFor as heartfelt as Max and the boys made their material out to be, there's no doubting for a second that \"Roots\" is ultimately uninspired and lifeless. On a musical level, the group's well of collective creativity was bone dry amidst this 70+ minute mishmash. Years after being a bastion of endless riffage, we'd be lucky to get 2 or 3 riffs TOTAL song by song, with many of them mere half-step chord progressions, numbing repetition and that oh-so grating upper register dissonance so common with Korn-clone nu metal acts (the beginning of \"Spit\" is the worst example of the lot). Guitars that once bestowed chaotic butchery now merely shove you about, vocals that literally spat fire now mildly insult and drums that came at the listener in at least three or four different directions break down so heavily and often that it's a wonder the engine could turn over at all. And at the main forefront is Ross Robinson's shit production, which robs a lot of the body from the songs and rendering them flat, unimpressive and drudging from end to end. It almost becomes a chore to continue on the further in you go track by track, with no one song better, worse or really standing out amongst the rest; I swear at least three of the songs therein are so interchangeable that you could retitle them and no one would notice. \n\nThings were already on the down slope for quite a few out there with \"Chaos A.D.\", wherein the band found themselves stylistically painting themselves into a corner, and with the release of this the corner went from being limiting to outright gone. Yet the main problem with many of the opinions placed upon this is that, more often than not, this is singled out as the one definitive moment in which \"metalness\" was cast asunder in favor of commercial excess. Those who would believe that aren't entirely wrong, but it's unfair to only pick on Sepultura. This decade was very unkind to metal, as we're all aware, and as I'd said before bands who were on top of the world years ago had to do whatever it took to maintain focus and attention during this time of social upheaval. Survival instinct if nothing else. For fuck's sake, your beloved Big Four of Thrash Metal weren't immune to the curse of the 90s, either! None of them! \"Cryptic Writings?\" \"Volume 8: The Threat is Real?\" \"Load??\" \"Diabolus in Musica??\" Exodus and Testament dropping off the map? Need I go on? I hope not. But, if \"Chaos A.D.\" has taught me anything it's that, at their core, Sepultura just flat out don't care what you think; they'll do what they feel is right by them no matter the cost. And really, of all the thrash bands the 80s spat at us they seemed to have the most to say, shooting for legitimate societal woes versus \"What if?\" political rantings and Satanic buffoonery. Maybe their survival instinct was the result of them needing as big a podium as can be to showcase the world in all its shit glory. Yet does that absolve the band in any way given how \"Roots\" came out? Not a chance.\n\nAll in all \"Roots\" may have had some deep-rooted (heh...) concepts underneath all the high school angst and blinding blur, but the whole of the work is just too lacking to take it all in. I may have heard worse nu metal bands and albums, but I've heard far better Sepultura. We all have.\n",
        "\nAgainst has been my favorite Sepultura album for quite some time now, it just succeeds where so many have not. Sepultura was left for dead by a lot of 'fans' after their former front man Max Cavalera was forced to leave the band after an argument over the band's management in 1996. While the one leaving was quickly grabbing together all the things he needed to birth his nu metal project Soulfly, Sepultura sought for a new front man and stumbled on Derrick Green not much later. Now, this is where opinions started to differ quite a bit. Many people held firm to their beloved band and gave Green a chance to prove what he had up his sleeve, and others were so fed up with Max Cavalera being forced to leave the band (Although I'm not quite sure whether the spoken word has mentioned the real truth about what happened so far) that they gave the man a warm pat on the back and abandoned Sepultura for the new band Max was putting together, and others just stood in the middle and merely waited to see what both bands would do next.\n\nAgainst is to this day still considered a failure in a lot of aspects. Fans didn't really like it, it didn't sell nearly as much as its predecessor, and it's rarely even mentioned by the band itself. None of the tracks are played live and I get the feeling the band themselves don't really like this. It's a shame, because I'm here to say that Against is a fucking masterpiece. Perhaps, against all odds it is, but I don't care. Against shows a band having pulled itself together and rise above in the process. This is hands down the best groove metal album I have ever heard, even when it's not really a groove metal album. Against marked the beginning of a trio of alternative groove/hardcore hybrids which made the band lose basically 75% of its then-current active fanbase. I can understand why, early Green-era Sepultura is not for everyone, it's rather tasteless music. You really have to like this sort of stuff to even find a smidgen of enjoyment here and basically all Green-era albums released to date. I happen to like later Sepultura quite a bit, with some of the band's best works of all time being among them. \n\nThat's not an opinion many people will share with me, but I really see more in Against than I see in Arise for example. For one, this album shows a band with a completely unique identity, even if the elements of the style they're playing are far from unique on their own. Sure, the band's early albums were something new for their time, but nowadays there are bands who've tried the same thing and came off just as successful as the band themselves did, if not even more. Against is unrivalled, nobody will ever make an album like this again. This is like nothing else, nobody has the courage (or faintest hint of interest, rather) to try and replicate the approach this album takes. This is one of the most recognizable records the metal scene will ever lay its eyes upon. Renewal is another example of an album winning where it was basically predestined to lose. Against (punz) what would seem like perfectly normal logic considering the nature of the bands in question, both this and Renewal are complete masterpieces of metal and outshine anything else in the band's respective discographies.\n\nThe biggest question surrounding this album was of course if Derrick Green was able to make up for the loss of Max Cavalera, basically the beating heart of the band during his stint. Well, I feel he's done more than well and actually outshines Max Cavalera on certain records due to having much more of a personality than his predecessor. Like the band's style with the big American as the frontman, he's someone whose vocals you just have to \"get\". His harsh shouts and yells are relatively 'tuff' in their style and resemble something a metalcore band could have used, but his weirdness and unusual approach always add a certain degree of energy to the music he's yelling along with. I genuinely like the guy here; his aggressive punchy style really fits the nature of the music, which is also pretty pumping from time to time, especially during the album's more hardcore-influenced tracks.\n\nTo explain Against general type of songs is a complete pain in the ass. There are a couple of tracks which are hardcore, a couple are thrashier, but most stick to an alternative groove idea. Yet, while seemingly influenced by metal genres, Against isn't really a metal album. I've seen people calling this nu metal and there's some sense in that statement. There's only a handful of metal riffs found here, most of the playing on this album is something you would rather hear on an alternative rock or hardcore album indeed. Just listen to \"Reza\" for example, this is one of the faster tracks from the album, yet it doesn't even have a lead riff. The guitar plays something you'd more likely hear on a Radiohead album, applying bucketloads of effects to make it sound truly different. This is the case on a lot of tracks; some have weird, dissonant and airy leads that you can't really pinpoint to anything but what Sepultura plays here and on later releases. And when the band actually playing something that could make its way onto a metal album, they're more like the heavily downtuned things you could hear on Roots, only generally faster and not as drowned in its own levels of distortion.\n\nAgainst has the surface aesthetics of a nu metal album. The guitar is pretty low and heavy, the bass guitar is quite inaudible but pretty damn typical once you hear it, there's a lot of emphasis on the vocals and the percussion, and songs generally stay to slower \"easy-to-headbang-to\" tempos. The individual performances are far from impressive technically, but on a sonic basis almost orgasmic in how incredibly memorable and effective they are. This album constantly makes you forget how simple it is, the unusual progression of songs is unlike anything you've heard and will hear. The guitar rarely plays a riff/lead one can't headbang to, and that instead of technically impressive and complex leads is more than accepted because this album seemingly doesn't need any of that to be as effective as it is now. The drumming also isn't very impressive, Iggor does his job of delivering a drum performance that does what it\u2019s supposed to do, but it's not anything more than very fitting for the album itself.\n\nSo yeah, Against represents the peak of a band having found an identity of its own and making the best use imaginable of it. There are loads of albums that are different and unusual in how they sound. But Against is different, man. This is all that the genre \"alternative metal\" stands for, it's so goddamn effective in just how alternative it is that it's by far one of the most memorable pieces of music I have ever heard. Love it or hate it, this is Against, one of the best albums the metal scene will ever bring forth.\n",
        "\nIt's been quite the roller-coaster of musical emotions for the once and future kings of thrash metal Sepultura following the departure of the Cavalera brothers one by one. Rewriting the description of \"hit or miss\", subsequent albums from \"Against\" onward had both moments of unexpected greatness and head-through-the-wall awfulness, more song by song than album by album, but the gods bless these Brazilian goons for sticking it out as long and (questionably) best they can. That being said, the bulk of \"Kairos\" showed promise that the group had more cohesion going within their style, though not in a complete way, which makes even the most passerby of listeners curious to see if they could again gaze upon the vacant throne they once put a single foot upon. That may be stretching it a bit, but you know what I mean.\n\nSo here we have their latest. How have things come in the years since \"Kairos\"...?\n\nFirst of all, I'm gonna get it out of the way...this is one MOUTHFUL of an album title. A strange one at that, and one I do hope makes sense within the context of the album's themes. But other than that, it's probably as close to a return to form as the group would ever undertake. Featuring a stripped down production approach, an increase in focus on blistering thrash rhythms and a very death metal-like undercurrent, this is the band at its most focused since \"Chaos A.D.\", not needing to waste time or energy on bizarre concepts and storytelling in its broadest form. The fractured sense of songwriting and chaotic pacing still shows a bit of their one-time hardcore leanings and avant-garde elements, but all in all I was pretty damned transfixed all throughout. Just when you think you have a song pegged, it veers into a direction you don't/didn't expect; wicked-as-sin grooves, \"Slayer Baby\" leads, bruising drumwork and bestial screams (Mr. Derrick Green is in top, and seemingly rare, form here over anything else he's done...) that beg listens and appreciation in their own little ways.\n\nIt's been quite a long time since the band sounded so spirited, so engaged, laser sight pointed at the heads of would-be listeners and detractors who thought them unworthy without a Cavalera in the line-up (did we forget the doldrums of \"Roots?\" Or \"Nation?\" Did we CHOOSE TO FORGET??). Truly better within the sum of its parts, it's interesting to see the utter increase of more brutal measures and a serious lack of the tribal percussion persuasions they'd utilized for quite a few years and releases. Maybe that was just a phase? Something new to try? Whatever the case, it seems like the 'TURA boys don't have anything to prove in that regard and would sooner just let the heaviness flow out as naturally as can be without needing to resort too much on older gimmickry that, while still a necessary part of their oeuvre, it only appears here and there, mainly amidst the more crawling groove-laden sections that call for it (case in point: the \"Roots\"-y intro to \"The Bliss of Ignorants\"), for the raging deathly sections need not be bogged down by smatterings of bongo blast beats that would only serve to distract. Simply put? This rocks. Pretty damned hard.\n\nAt the end of the day, just when I was ready to write Sepultura off for their lack of creative focus, they decide to throw me for a loop. Far better than much of their latest work, this may not be within the upper echelon as \"Arise\", or even \"Morbid Visions\", with me, but I can see myself enjoying this further down the road.\n",
        "\nAs their third live album, Metal Veins- Alive at Rock in Rio, Sepultura is joined by Les Tambours du Bronx, a French industrial percussion band, for their set at Rock in Rio 5. The hour-long performance includes songs that span Sepultura\u2019s thirty-year career as a band and features quite a few songs from their albums Chaos AD and Kairos.\n\nFrom the very first seconds of the live album, the tribal drums of Les Tambours du Bronx can be heard asserting their role when performing with Sepultura. The percussion band is praised for their ability to defy the bounds of genre, regularly including influences from hip-hop, heavy metal, afrobeat, as well as an assortment of other musical genres. Likewise, Les Tambours du Bronx performs as an imaginative fifth member of Sepultura once you are warmed to their inclusion. Sepultura themselves has also done their fair role of genre-bending, placing a cover of The Prodigy\u2019s \u2018Firestarter\u2019 in the middle of the concert.\n\nIt takes Derrick Green a few songs into the set in order to properly demonstrate the full range of his vocals, but by \u2018Sepulnation\u2019 he is in top form, prompting the audience to chant the lyrics. Each song from Metal Veins- Alive at Rock in Rio carries its own unique demonstration of power and raw energy. The live album is produced very well, conveying the vigorous expression the two bands have established during their set. I am even inclined to feel a little jealous of those who were able to attend the concert and fully appreciate the mashing of drums and the abrasion of screeching guitars along with fellow concertgoers.\n\nBy adding the pounding of fourteen drums from Les Tambours du Bronx, Sepultura\u2019s music is increasingly technical, undoubtedly forcing both bands to remain focused through the entirety of the set. When listening to the live album, Gojira is reminiscent as this performance shares their technical expertise and forcefulness of the drums. Les Tambours du Bronx\u2019s tribal intensity proves to be vital when performing with Sepultura and provides them an additional aspect to their music.\n\nOriginally written for  http://iridescencemedia.com\n",
        "\nI must admit that when I first bought this video at a store in Los Angeles, CA back then in 1992, I knew that I was getting a hold to a masterpiece. This band had caught my attention and had changed my lifestyle in the late 80\u2019s that with my never ending listening to it, I had to get a physical video of them and this video was it! \n\nThis is an excellent home video that captures the moment at when Sepultura was at its rise to glory and fame. It is fronted by Max Cavalera (ex-Sepultura) and also includes their previous drummer Igor Cavalera (brother to Max) along with Andreas Kisser and Paulo Jr. But it is not just a music video with live songs in Barcelona, it has important documentary to it. Each member of the \u201cold Sepultura\u201d lineup comments about his experience with the band in interview. They explain what it was to overcome the hardships in Belo Horizonte, Brazil while growing up. There are several humorous moments mainly at the end that make this video a memorable one. \n\nIt is just amazing how Sepultura provides us with a great set list of songs in this video. It is a compilation of their best songs leading up to and including its Arise album. The video is packed with a powerful punch of thrash/death metal from beginning to the end! \n\nThe video kicks off with an interesting initial intro that leads to the powerful fast drumming song \u201cArise\u201d as the first song in the list. Next is my most favorite song \u201cDesperate Cry\u201d. Another song of the Arise album, but this one starts off with commanding acoustics and later electrifies in intensity while still keeping the heavy thrashing that keeps you dominated and controlled in the Sepultura realm.\n\nThe music pauses for a while to give way to the band members to comment on their experiences of being with the band and to explain on what it is to live in Brazil. \u201cDead Embryonic Cells\u201d follows. This song is also high energy packed with changing riffs and fast paced drumming to keep the viewer/listener still entertained. Then \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d, a song from their previous album Beneath The Remains, kicks in with Max displaying tremendous vocal strength and ability. Without any doubt this is a killer song too.\n\nAfter a brief documentary pause \u201cAltered State\u201d follows up and with its shining blast as the lyrics say convinces anybody that this song kicks-ass to the extreme. It is an excellent thrash song and a favorite of mine too with amazing riffs and energetic drumming. Sepultura then shows off its continued brutal thrashing strength with \u201cInner Self\u201d, yet another song from the Arise album - how awesome!!!\n\nBy now you definitely feel that this video does not suffer from any unnecessary songs or boring parts. \u201cEscape to The Void\u201d, \u201cTroops of Doom\u201d and the prominent \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d display just how much strength Sepultura had garnered even before getting to its Arise album. \n\nThe video closes off with its last song \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d. The huge Barcelona crowd as you can see had been satisfied and strength-lifted. And to leave its impact here Sepultura leaves us with some humorous images and exhibit of Brazilian soccer talent. So if you don\u2019t own this VHS video like I do, then you must YouTube this album. \n\nWith all much said, I must finally say this video is flawless and very entertaining. It is a without any doubt a gem to all collectors of Sepultura\u2019s music and videos.\n",
        "\nWhat the.....? I mean, WHAT THE...?\n\nThe previous album, Chaos AD, was a great album. Unlike some people, I'm not annoyed by the fact Sepultura changed their sound for that record - it worked. They produced a great, modern metal album with some thought-provoking lyrics and a real sense of driving, righteous anger and standing up to injustice. The tribal sounds that were introduced on a few tracks were good, lending texture and variety to the record. Overall, they made a classic of early 90s heavy music.\n\nSo for their next album Roots, they decided to keep evolving, and among other things they retained the tribal sounds and vibes. Roots features a fair amount of the tribal drumming that was present on songs like Kaiowas, and also features some traditional Brazilian instruments [the intro of \"Attitude\"]. The band even ventured into the jungle to record with a native Brazilian tribe [\"Itsari\"]. They delved into the native musical sounds and traditions of their own country, and worked them into the album. Which is fine. The tribal sounds are interesting and lend some welcome texture to the record. It's just that the music Sepultura play on here is mostly awful nu-metal.\n\nOpener \"Roots Bloody Roots\" is by far the best song on the album. Despite being buried in a nasty, Korn-esque guitar tone, it's still an absolute monster of a song and is deservedly a live favourite. The percussion is heavy and worked in to the music quite well, and as a cathartic roar of rage it serves its purpose. However things go rapidly downhill from then on in. \"Attitude\" is kind of a half-song. It's not really got much drive to it but just seems to rage about aimlessly, in a kind of pointless, bitter way. It feels like a demo that the band forgot about. The rest of the album fails to improve. \"Rattamahatta\" features Carlinhos Brown on percussion and has a nice groove for a while, but then Max steps in and starts doing odd vocal lines in the chorus which just don't sound good. As the record drags on and on, it becomes increasingly claustrophobic. Good riffs are few and far between, and a lot of the songs just sit there, not really doing much.\n\nSome respite comes through the gloom with \"Spit\" which at least has some kind of oomph to it and an anthemic chorus, but after that it's back to the Korn style downtuned guitars, two-note riffs and no hooks or exciting moments. \"Lookaway\" features Jon Davis in a guest spot, as well as Mike Patton [why did Patton get involved with such mediocre product?], and it's an absolute nadir, or maybe the low point is \"Dusted\" with an unbelievably bad, lame riff which just sounds completely flat and uninspired. And so it drags on and on, until the closing \"Dictatorshit\" a two-minute punkish blast with some very simplistic and obvious lyrics.\n\nWhat happened here? The get angry and fight vibe of Chaos AD has been replaced with an atmosphere of \"we're being wiped out, we'll go down, this is an outrage but we're probably screwed\" which doesn't make for a very inspiring listen. The whole record doesn't sound defiant, it sounds desperate, frightened, despairing. I mentioned the general claustrophobia of the record earlier - listening to this album is like going on an expedition into the jungle and getting hopelessly lost in the trees with no idea how to find one's way out. The whole vibe of the record is like that and it's not a happy or rewarding or invigorating listen, just dreary and oppressive. The terrible production job by Ross Robinson doesn't help in this regard either, awful guitar tones, weak sounding instruments, everything sounds muddy and crap, which is I guess what you will get from hiring the man who was behind the mixing desk for Korn's albums.\n\nThe main problem around this era is that Max Cavalera seems to have had some kind of breakdown. Look at him during the Chaos AD years, then onstage around 1996, and he seems a completely different person. Taking cues from Jon Davis, hanging out with nu-metal bands, changing his image and most of all seemingly letting his songwriting skills degenerate rapidly into a mess of Korn riffs and simplistic lyrics. I have no idea what caused this but the change is alarming, and it's reflected in this absolute mess of an album, lacking ideas, energy, and songwriting in general. It's always sad to see a great band go into decline, it's even more shocking when that decline happens in under three years. An abysmal, claustrophobic and depressing record.\n",
        "\nHave you ever listened to an album that just mercilessly fucks your ears with stellar riffs for its entire runtime, never letting up for even a second? Well, to be blunt, Beneath the Remains is exactly that type of album. The album repeatedly punishes the listener with one crushing riff after another, smashing his/her skull with their utter speed and/or intensity. Well, the best way to break this absolute riff-fest of an album is definitely instrument by instrument. So without any further ado, let the reviewing commence.\n\nThe drums patterns are rather similar to that of Schizophrenia, containing a fair amount of your typical \"duh, duh, duh\" thrash beat, but also containing a decent amount of slower and more creative beats than their sophomore effort. Some of them are rather groovy and get you tapping your foot, balancing well with the faster, thrashier beats. In addition, the drum sound doesn't suck like it did on Schizophrenia, giving the beats a crisper sound and making the fills much more audible.\n\nThe bass isn't the most audible, and from what I hear it often follows the guitars. When the bass is audible it is quite decent, complementing the fucking awesome riffs, but not amazing. The somewhat lack of audibility does not necessarily hurt the album since you are often too busy thrashing your neck off, but some more audibility would be appreciated. Again, this doesn't detract from my score because it is really too minuscule to matter in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThe vocals could be best described as slightly-harsher-than-normal thrash metal shouts. They fit extremely well with the intensity of the album. Moreover, the still present Brazilian accent is entertaining to listen to for its comedic value. Not to say that it sounds stupid, which it doesn't, just kind of funny. Lyrically, Sepultura is nothing special, but I honestly don't pay attention to lyrics 90% of the time so, again, this is another flaw too trivial to matter.\n\nThe guitar work is what makes this album the anal desecrating masterpiece that it is. Imagine you're in the prison showers, you drop the soap, and get fucked in the ass by a gigantic, musclebound thug with a twelve inch dick. That musclebound thug is Beneath the Remains and his muscles and dick are the riffs in the album. The fucking riffs are some of the best I have ever heard in metal. Bone-crushingly intense, yet extremely catchy (not melodic though). The riffs are mainly a combination of mid-paced, groovy thrash riffs (more original than the standard mid-paced thrash riffs though) and neck breaking, faster than fuck riffs. As mentioned before, these riffs are intense. Emotionally, they bring forth feelings of hatred, rage, and malice. I can literally hear the riffs from this album playing when I want to beat the living shit out of someone. This is probably more of a personal feeling, but, either way, these hateful riffs just rape your ass and ears, leaving you waddling away after the carnage has finally ceased.\n\nSo, that's about all I have to say about the album. There are no standout tracks in my opinion, just a plethora of amazing riffs. This album should definitely be listened to in its entirety. Not doing so would make the experience incomplete. Without a doubt, Beneath the Remains is one of my personal favorites in the thrash metal genre and undeniably one of the best the genre has to offer. I definitely recommend this album for fans of thrash metal, but, as with Artillery's By Inheritance, all metalheads should pick this one up.\n",
        "\nIt's not hard to see why this 1993 release from the bold Brazilians caused such a stir among the metal community. It's also easy to see that this kind of album was on it's way and was the next logical step. The band really gained it's potency with the 1989 classic, Beneath The Remains and became a league of their own with smart songwriting, urgent production and uncompromising brutality. Their followup Arise, while still carrying the thrash metal card was clearly adopting some groove metal stylings. While still having plenty of breakneck tempos and progressive riff changes (Subtraction, Arise) like it's predecessor, it had more than a few laid back grooves (Desperate Cry, Dead Embryonic Cells) as a hint towards their change of pace to come.\n\nThis came full circle on this milestone of an album, Chaos A.D. We're introduced to the new direction straight away with Refuse/Resist, it's main motif is introduced in the form of a two note groove riff, pedaling back and forth in a pendulum like motion. Max Cavalera demonstrates a slightly higher intensity (and pitch) vocal delivery compared to the last few releases. While being a slower speed, the drums do not sacrifice any power and put maximum weight and flourish lock-stepped into the tempo with a certain tribal flair. Andy Wallace's production is fantastic, giving a new sense of clarity and definition not previously heard while truly capturing the essence of the band with plenty of punch and thickness to boot with respectable dynamics.\n\nTerritory increases the tempo slightly and really emphasizes the Brazilian tribal vibe in the drum work. It carries a sociopolitical undertone which is a common theme across this album and Max Cavalera's theme of choice for the most part of his output. The songwriting is clearly intended for the mainstream with a more simplified approach to the songwriting. While this is quite a jarring contrast for the discerning metal fan who came to love (maybe even worship) their previous signature songwriting style, the album performed remarkably for a metal album from Brazil, ranking as high as 11 on the UK Billboard charts and reaching gold status right across the Western nations (and silver in the U.K.) so they achieved their intended goal.\n\nThere seems to be at least a hint of their thrash metal roots with a fairly brisk punk beat in Slave New World. The main riff sounds quite similar to Inner Self but faster and in a lower tuning. Amen brings the tempo back down and showcases the prominent bass guitar not previously associated with this band, which goes quite some way to invoke the groovier feel across the album.\n\nKaiowas sets an all new precedent for Sepultura consisting entirely of acoustic guitars and tribal percussion set in a Welsh castle complete with chirping birds in tow! Propaganda has great pummeling riffs and double bass from Igor Cavalera. Max lays the smackdown against propaganda as implied and this song features a killer breakdown towards the end of the song. Sepultura may have changed their style but it's impossible to deny how well they do it.\n\nThe guitar solos of Andreas Kisser are quite different compared to the legendary fretwork of old, The lead guitarist opts for a highly experimental and mostly rhythmic approach, sometimes eschewing actual notes for frantic noises featuring pick-scrapes and whammy bar attacks. If fits the rest of the music most of the time but it's not up to the usual standard of lead work.\n\nThe tempo finally gets cooking with the all too short Biotech Is Godzilla featuring laughably paranoid and vague lyrics by Jello Biafra. This is one among very few songs to have an upbeat, thrash metal tempo and is less than two minutes to conform to the hardcore punk vibe. Nomad is decent and isn't all that weak but shows that the new formula is prone to sounding a bit repetitive and the distinction between each song begins to blur. Speaking of repetitive, We Who Are Not As Others consists of one repeated phrase being the song title and is rather subdued, lacking bite and direction. Manifest breathes a bit of life back into the mix. Max's narrates the Carandiru massacre in a megaphone voice. This song has just enough tempo and riff changes to keep up the interest and prevents it from falling into the lackadaisical mid-tempo stasis of We Who Are Not As Others.\n\nThe Hunt is a New Model Army cover that would seem rather out of place if you did not realize it was a cover song but in that context, it is a rather interesting take. Sepultura always make for interesting covers under their unique style. The lyrics are also consistent with the underlying theme, making it an appropriate choice. The album closes musically with Clenched Fist which starts with an interesting tri-tone effect and mixes up the laid back groove pulse with more urgent thrash tempos.\n\nThe last track is simply an attempted whacky comedy skit with the band members laughing nonstop. There is no bonus song on the track and seems a bit pointless and fillerish in an otherwise great record. In summary, Chaos A.D. is a very enjoyable album for most people who enjoyed their previous works and aren't afraid to see their favourite bands evolve and is a memorable introduction to Brazil's biggest musical export for first time listeners.\n",
        "\nSepultura took an undeniably large blow when one of its founding members, Max Cavalera, decided to leave the band, following a great deal of personal differences with the other members. His departure came at the band's height of popularity and shocked the heavy metal community. However, Andreas Kisser, Paulo Jr. and Igor Cavalera all vowed to carry on with the band, and found a replacement in the American Derrick Green. They quickly returned to the studio with a large amount of material and released Against to the public. However, it failed to leave the lasting impact that the last Max-fronted album, Roots, had on listeners. Although the music itself should not be seen as a failure, there are a few possible identifiable reasons why the album's reception was perhaps not what the band had hoped.\n\nMusically, the album continues the tribal-infested groove metal direction that the band had been heading towards since 1993's Chaos A.D. without adding too much in the way of new, but not sounding dull or recycled either. It manages to combine all the atmospheric and the heavy elements of past albums. However, it clearly showcases the band struggling to maintain their identity as a band following the departure of Max. There are some standard Sepultura rockers here, particularly during the first half of the album such as \"Choke\" which combines a nu-metal-esque rhythm with progressive eerie tribal elements to create a menacing anthem that has become a Green-era fan-favourite, \"Rumors\" which sets a hostile mood complete with a slower paced pounding beat and the echoed screams of Green, and \"Boycott\", which starts off as a faster track featuring a chanting chorus before descending into a slow rhythm with screaming guitars.\n\nHowever, there are also several shorter tracks that seem to outweigh the full-length songs, including tribal instrumental pieces, such as \"Tribus\", which focuses on the percussion but with an extra layer of haunting, eerie guitars, or heavy hardcore punk-influenced tracks such as \"Against\", which kicks off the album with a quick, full band assault with lyrics presenting a cynical view of the world (\"The more I see, the more I hate, the more I learn, the more I fake\") and \"Drowned Out\", which contains some rapid fire vocal delivery set to simple but effective fast guitar riffs and hard-hitting drums. These tracks are not necessarily poor, of course, but it leaves you feeling like the band didn't put as enough focus on making proper, fully-fledged songs as they maybe could have, but rather quickly recorded any ideas that came to mind without really giving themselves the time to explore some of them fully.\n\nNew vocalist Derrick Green does show that he is a competent vocalist. He growls and screams with just as much fury as Max did during his tenure with the band. He even shows off melody in his voice on several tracks, such as \"Old Earth\", which features quiet verses that allow listeners to focus on his voice fully. I think he did a very good job with the songs that were written for this album seeing as many of the songs were written by the rest of the band before he officially joined. He certainly puts his own stamp on the Sepultura sound; it's actually fairly difficult to imagine Max performing on any of these songs.\n\nProduction wise - there's nothing much wrong with this album. The drums sound just as hard hitting as they should and all the tribal elements are clearly audible in the mix. The guitars crunch and wail, though I do think the bass should have been a little more audible, although when we do hear it clearly (such as in \"Rumors\") they pack just as much of a punch as the guitars do.\n\nOverall, Against is certainly not a bad album. However, I can see why some people may not have seen it as enough of a bounce-back from Max's departure for the band to be able to carry on their success, instead suffering declining sales with each new release. The album is patchy at times, some songs being very strong efforts that are up there with the best of Max Cavalera-led Sepultura, others somewhat forgettable. Perhaps if their first venture with Derrick was able to gel into a more of a cohesive, consistent effort, listeners would have been more receptive of the album, and the band's popularity may have lasted longer. However, there is still much to be enjoyed here, and it's a good starting point for listeners who want to experience Sepultura with Derrick Green.\n",
        "\nI've decided to review all of the 'Complete Roadrunner Collection' boxsets that I own, I've done Deicide and Obituary so now it's time for Sepultura.\n\nIn the world of extreme metal, Sepultura are legendary. Although there's an obvious divide in terms of the lineup (Max and post-Max) there's also the issue of a major change in musical style. This boxset covers the Max Cavalera years and the shift in sound away from thrash. This collection has 5 albums from 1987-1996 and these albums are almost universally regarded as Sepultura's golden age. This set is perfect for a new fan. The only glaring omission being the debut album and/or EP, which have been reissued by Roadrunner before so this makes little sense. Even so, I personally like this product but I'm writing this review as a warning to others about the issues regarding the content (or lack of) in this boxset.\n\nAdmittedly, this is yet another cash-in from Roadrunner Records but to be fair to them they haven't milked the Sepultura back catalogue for quite a while and this release does serve a purpose. For me, this is ideal. I have an ever-growing music collection and limited space. A compact box of 5 albums I like is great, especially as i got it at a good price. The re-releases of some of these albums in the late 90's had bonus tracks on the end, the albums in this boxset don't. I actually prefer this, I'd much rather have an album as it was intended rather than a load of random crap tacked onto the end. I also have 2 Sepultura compilations with those bonus tracks on so I don't need them on these albums. 'Beneath the Remains' in particular had pointless drum tracks as a so called bonus, I'm quite glad to not have that on here. I also didn't have standalone versions of 'Chaos A.D' or 'Roots' (I've got a ridiculously rare version of the former that I hardly touch and I only have 'Roots' as part of 'The Roots of Sepultura' compilation) so this is a good value boxset for my needs.\n\nNow, the negative points: The 5 albums come in cardboard sleeves and are stored within a box. No liner notes, no photos, no lyrics, no details beyond the tracklisting. As i mentioned above, no bonus tracks either although I'm glad about this. Basically, you get 5 cds in a box. I have no real interest in the lyrics nor the liner notes of the previous reissues and if I want to know album details I can use this website or others. I still prefer a physical product over downloading, but as there's so much information online and I'm limited for space, this box suits me.\n\nAs for the actual content of this boxset, well you get 5 albums from Sepultura's classic period. What you don't get is 'Morbid Visons/Bestial Devastation', which is a shame. At least you get 'Schizophrenia' which is raw, death/thrash that fans of Possessed, Sodom and Kreator would probably like and an improvement on the (absent from here) debut. Then Sepultura went full thrash. 'Beneath the Remains' and 'Arise' are classics of thrash and massively influential on most extreme metal since. 'Chaos A.D' is a divisive album, seeing a switch to a more groove influenced sound, but also bringing in tribal elements. 'Roots' pushed this further, adding elements of nu-metal (how dare they?!?!) and pioneering a whole new sound. Some love it, some hate it. For more information on those albums there are plenty of reviews on this website. I personally like all 5 of them to varying degrees (Roots is too long and has too much filler, but also some classic songs whereas Schizophrenia is solid rather than special). \n\nSo you get 5 top albums at their most basic in a handy little box. This is ideal for my collection and it's worth buying if you're a new fan exploring this great band. But for anyone wanting full album information and bonus tracks I'd recommend buying the albums separately.\n",
        "\nThe Sepultura came out of the depths of Hell in 1986 with \"Morbid Visions\", bringing with it a sound that Brazilians could have never imagined and stunned the world. Young boys from a country which, at the time, was considered a third-world country too treacherous for any metaller to survive in, formed a band and created Slayer/Venom-inspired music with low-fi production. That band, Sepultura, eventually decided to make another album in the hopes that they would be noticed by major labels like Metal Blade. I must say that that album, \"Schizophrenia\", is truly an excellent piece of work. It shows improvement in the young boys' musicianship and is a step up from \"Morbid Visions\".\n\nSepultura have come a long way from writing love songs to the Father of Lies, for they shifted their focus of Satanism as a lyrical theme to violence, injustice, and inner feelings as lyrical themes. Take for instance \"To the Wall\". That song is about the final moments of a person as a firing squad decides his fate. \"Septic Schizo\" is about a person dissatisfied with his own feelings and hurts himself because of it. This shows that the boys have expanded their lyrical horizons greatly and put the often overused lyrical theme of blasphemy as an afterthought. They have also improved on their riffing skills. While the E-note rhythm is present in every song on the album, they've done some exploring in terms of chord patterns. None of their songs sound too similar to each other. In its main riff, \"Escape to the Void\" has an interesting chord pattern that goes well with its E-note rhythm. Another song that features a cool chord pattern is \"Screams Behind the Shadows\", which can be heard during the verses. Those patterns aren't found anywhere on \"Morbid Visions\" and it shows how far the band has gotten in terms of musicianship. Andreas Kisser had entered the band at that time, so I can see why the riffage and solos sound better than it did previously.\n\nWhile the boys improved with their riffage, there is still the problem with the production quality of the album. Although the problems with the production of \"Morbid Visions\" aren't present on \"Schizophrenia\", there are still some different issues that are definitely noticeable. Max Cavalera's vocals sound a little grainy and muffled, like he was singing through an old, beat-up microphone that had been used since the 1940's. The guitars sound a little grainy as well, but they don't sound like angry bees so much like they do on \"Morbid Visions\". The snare drum does sound like an actual snare drum rather than a plastic bucket that they brought in the studio, but the tom-toms sort of sound somewhat like the bucket drum of \"Morbid Visions\", but not much. The bass drum's sound is a little overdone too, for it seems louder than all of the drums combined. \n\nEven with the production a little sub-par, \"Schizophrenia\" delivers some of the finest death/thrash metal ever to come out of Brazil. It shows that the young boys were not only growing up, but were also getting better at their game. It's a far cry form the primitive musicianship and production quality found in the \"Morbid Visions\" album put out a year earlier, and it's a must-have for all collectors of anything thrash or death metal. It helped push Sepultura further into the metal world and because of it, the boys have really earned their stripes.\n",
        "\nLong ago, it was a time of peace, happiness, and prosperity. Little did everybody know that their time of peace was to end. Suddenly, out of nowhere, the ground shook, creating a mighty rumbling sound, and the people shook with terror. Then it came. Bursting out of the earth, coming from the very depths of Hell (Brazil, actually), the Sepultura rose. Its guitars growled with an ever burning hatred for mankind. This was the dawning of the Sepultura, a mighty beast which would destroy all with its wrath..... Yeah, I know, I went overboard a little with this, but Sepultura was actually a group of young teenage musicians, influenced by many bands, namely Slayer. They were still very young when they released their first full-length effort \"Morbid Visions\", and their lack of experience, along with the tight budget of the albums production, shows.\n\nEverybody knows that the production that was used to make this album was low-fi and primitive. The sound may be pleasing to some black metal fans, but to others, it's kind of crappy. The snare drums sound like Igor Cavalera was hitting a plastic bucket rather than an actual snare drum, and the guitars have this sort of buzzing sound, kind of like that of swarm of angry bees. Both of them seem to drown out the bass guitar, which is barely even heard, if at all. I can't blame them for this poor-quality production, cos when they made it, they were young, and barely had any money to make an album using top-notch production. What's more is that Brazil, and especially Belo Horizonte, was very poor. Do you expect to hear an album coming from Brazil at that time sounding like it had been produced by a label such as Metal Blade or Megaforce? I didn't think so. I'm giving Sepultura a free pass on the production, though, cos hey, who can blame them? They didn't have a lot of money!\n\nNow to the music itself. Even with the crude production, there are some things that the band needed to work on before actually shelling out an album. Some of their songs have the same chord patterns as others, making them sound almost like the exact same song. For example the intro to \"Funeral Rites\" sounds A LOT like the intro to the all-time classic \"Troops of Doom\". The speeding riffs on both songs also bear an uncanny resemblance to each other. The e-note rhythm is used quite a bit on the album too. All of the songs, not almost all of them, but ALL of the songs on this album feature the e-note rhythm. They are relatively easy to play on the guitar I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, I'm just saying that it shows the band's inexperience when they made this. It's sort of like Warbringer when they released \"War without End\", except with shoddy production. However, unlike Warbringer, their choice of time signatures did vary, though they were speedy. There was one to two different time signatures in each song (three if you count the intros to some of them). It's kind of hard to tell them apart, but who cares? At least they've got something going! Despite its lack of riffing skills, \"Morbid Visions\" has all of the energy and intensity it needs to start mosh pits.\n\nThe band not only lacked musicianship when they first started out, they also lacked lyrical creativity. Have you ever noticed that pretty much all of the songs on here had lyrics that had to do with everybody's favorite Lord of Darkness? That's right, that's all they talk about. Look, I'm not a Christian prude or anything (I'm just as disillusioned with the corruption going on in the church as a lot of other people), I'm saying that Sepultura really didn't think too much about writing songs that were about things other than Satan. They could have written songs about how they were fed up with all of the poverty, the corruption, and the violence that was going on in Brazil. They could have at least written songs about wicca, or anything that isn't related to the church, but nope! It's all about the Father of Lies, here. Though, to be fair, singing about the Devil was all that the band needed to get attention. That's how Slayer got successful, and made them one of the biggest bands in the world. Sepultura, on the other hand, would eventually shove Satan out of the way in favor of writing songs about stuff not Satan-related in \"Schizophrenia\" and later releases.\n\nWhat could you expect from a band of newbies on a small, unknown label? Not much, I suppose, but do I enjoy this album, despite all of the things that a young Sepultura could have improved on? I say I actually kind of do. It might not have been an excellent start, but it did get the band noticed, so that they could eventually get signed to a bigger label to produce \"Schizophrenia\", and eventually leave Brazil to tour the world. Max Cavalera himself admits that \"Morbid Visions\" wasn't Sepultura's best effort. He said that it was the product of a very young band with very little experience, and I can believe him. It's easy to acknowledge the band's lack of creativity when the album came out, but then again, Sepultura really didn't need much when it started its high-powered attack.\n",
        "\nI think perhaps that, if this was suddenly the only thrash album on the face of the earth that I'd be fine with it. Maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but it should go some way towards explaining how I feel about this one. Beneath The Remains is a strong contender for my favourite thrash album ever, and definitely in my top 10 metal albums period. To elaborate I need to take you back to when I first heard it. This was one of those \"benchmark\" albums that raised the bar quite early on what I considered to be the hardest, fastest, most extreme music during my quest through adolescence to see just how far it could really go. Before this must have been Reign In Blood, if memory serves. Of course, if we're speaking in those terms, Beneath The Remains has been trumped innumerable times since by various death and black metal albums, but those benchmark experiences have a tendency to stay with us. Context is indeed of great importance when it comes to experiencing a lot of music. At the time I heard this I was 14 years old. As I say the most extreme things I was aware of at the time were Slayer albums such as Hell Awaits and Reign In Blood. Suffice to say Beneath The Remains promptly demolished my ideas about metal at that time. Sure, those old Slayer albums are still evil as hell, fast and heavy, but this seemed to top even them. I had a best friend at that time who was largely into the same stuff as me, and we'd share music (specifically metal) as we came across it. He was the one who showed me Reign In Blood, and I'll never forget the way my jaw just dropped when I heard it. Some time later I showed him this, and he didn't like it. That was when I knew I was a fan of extreme music, and this album was the springboard.\n\nReality is always more disturbing than horror, and Beneath The Remains is definitely a take on reality as opposed to Slayer's largely fantastical satanic approach. The venomous lyrics, fueled by passion and righteous anger were one of the things that attracted me the most over time, spinning tales of dystopia and human corruption that you don't have to be from fucked up South America to understand or relate to in your own life. At first though, the main attraction was the music itself, the lyrics hard to distinguish through Max's thick accent to my virgin ears. What still impresses me as much as day one is just how FAST the riffs are. Today any fool (me, for example!) can put together lightning speed guitar tracks piece by piece in pro tools with enough time, in 1989 it took a little more and it is a remarkable achievement. The riffs are furious and unrelenting, the melodies dark and enthralling. The tightness of the playing might cause wrist pain in guitar playing listeners! The drums are constantly holding everything together with skill and there is some nice playing going on, but this is really a guitar album. Bass is practically non existent, though Scott Burns is still to be commended for the punchy and aggressive production. Of course, its not all just breakneck speed from beginning to end. There are some great slower and mid paced riffs to shake it up, and in the case of Mass Hypnosis is the prompt for a fantastic, melodic solo. The previous album Schizophrenia (also essential thrash in its own right) had showed the Seps moving towards this point out of their more primitive beginnings, and this album is where they arrived. Then began the slow descent into painful mediocrity, but let's not go there! And who can forget the amazing cover art? Brilliantly detailed and mysterious.\n\nThe best songs? All of them. Though there are some (Mass Hypnosis, Lobotomy for example) I like more than the rest, discussing the songs individually is irrelevant. More importantly I can't be bothered to dissect every little detail that I like, because you should be doing that for yourself. This album is PURE THRASH. It makes no apologies for being so, and doesn't care if you don't approve because plenty of others do and always will. Though its not a From This Day Forward or a Time Does Not Heal, albums that show how far the boundaries of the genre can be pushed in various ways, I would go as far as to say this album represents the \"conventional\" heads down, all out thrash approach taken to its logical conclusion. All further attempts by anyone are, for all intents and purposes (minus a few worthy exceptions), a waste of time. I'm looking at you, modern retro thrash scene. You just won't top this. Stop trying.\n",
        "\n\u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d for sure was like a new beginning for Sepultura; they entered the world! First of all, after being signed to small Brazilian label Cogumelo (a legendary label nowadays for sure) they\u2019ve found a new record company \u2013 and this time it was a major label; one, which was about to have a huge influence on the thrash and especially death metal in years to come, with distribution worldwide: Roadrunner Records. With them Sepultura became one of the most recognized names in the metal world; together they conquered it! Secondly, the recording session for \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d may have taken place in Brazil, but the mixing was done at the famous Morrisound Studio, with Scott Burns and Tom Morris doing the job. And obviously soundwise the album is a huge step forward when compared to the two previous LPs (\u201cMorbid Visions\u201d especially). It is enough to say that the sound of \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d is powerful, aggressive and perfectly clean. Finally, the songwriting for the album is better than before, with some absolutely crushing songs and utterly memorable riffs and the performance of every band member is simply excellent (I especially like the drumming of Igor Cavalera, who\u2019s such an awesome drummer). You can truly hear that Sepultura has evolved and progressed a lot and even if I really like \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d I just must admit that \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d is slightly better than its predecessor and probably will always be the best thing, which those Brazilians have ever recorded (I am not even going to comment what they\u2019re recording nowadays\u2026 I don\u2019t care, the band doesn\u2019t exist for me).\n\n\u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d begins like a dream album. Side A has four tracks and all four of them are just absolute crushers. The title track is an instant killer, with such an awesome riffing and arrangements that for sure it is one of my favourite Sepultura songs ever! A calm acoustic theme is like a calm before the storm, as suddenly a furious death / thrashing riffing erupts and the powerful energy of this music fills my room. Oh, so fast, so furious\u2026 and one can call it death metal, most will probably call it thrash metal \u2013 but thrash metal in most aggressive and intense way possible\u2026 who cares what will it be called if the music is awesome? \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d is a real highlight of the album for me (\u201cWho has won? Who has died? Beneath the Remains!!!\u201d \u2013 yeah man!), but it is followed by another killer \u201cInner Self\u201d, so there\u2019s no time to breath, but headbanging continues! Again the riffs are absolutely amazing, the drumming and vocals are perfect and so are also the whole arrangements. This song is slower than the one before, not so intense (although it fastens in the chorus part), there are some more melodic parts here and there, but it still kicks ass seriously. Andreas Kisser shows his great skills in guitar leads department, Igor\u2019s drums are strong\u2026 And suddenly \u201cStronger than Hate\u201d begins! For sure one of the fastest and most aggressive songs; really nice, I love how it begins, with those melodic leads and then when it speeds up. This song has a guest vocal participation in chorus part by some well known vocalists from bands like Obituary, Incubus and Atheist, but they only scream the song title in the chorus, so you cannot even guess that John Tardy is there, as you just couldn\u2019t hear it, so if I didn\u2019t read about it in the booklet then I would never know. OK, no time for bullshit, \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d starts\u2026 the vocals of Max Cavalera are sometimes a bit weird, more in the classic thrash metal vein I would say\u2026 also some of the ideas for this song are slightly weird, so not everything about this song is perfect in my opinion, but it is good anyway.\n\nSide B starts with two songs, which not often are mentioned as Sepultura\u2019s finest pieces, but I personally like them a lot: \u201cSarcastic Existence\u201d and \u201cSlaves of Pain\u201d (this one was originally written by Kisser for his previous band Pestilence). They both are excellent and shred with some absolutely phenomenal riffs and that sheer aggression. I love the arrangements again, the drumming and just everything about these two songs. What is so great about \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d album is that even those more mediocre songs like \u201cLobotomy\u201d and \u201cHungry\u201d sound great \u2013 the latter has some truly nice riffs and is a perfect headbanger in my opinion\u2026 I bet every band would love to have such \u201cmediocre\u201d songs on their album hehe! Finally the LP is finished with \u201cPrimitive Future\u201d \u2013 and the tempo is once more fast and the song is truly aggressive and savage\u2026 Thrash attack! I have nothing more to add, really\u2026 If you don\u2019t know this album then I have no idea what were you waiting for\u2026 it is a mandatory release for every metalhead, whatever style of metal is his favourite.\nStandout tracks: \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d, \u201cInner Self\u201d, \u201cSlaves of Pain\u201d, \u201cPrimitive Future\u201d\nFinal rate: 90/100\n",
        "\nOkay, some decent songs, but overall the band just sunk in crap in overall estimation. Definitely a decline in songwriting capabilities, the band just hit rock bottom even though Max was still with them. The 1st couple of songs are tolerable, but the album as a whole fell short in dismay and destruction. It seemed so half assed, lacking the aggression and originality in songwriting that they used to have. They just sold out with this one, kind of along the lines of Metallica with their \"Black\" album. Just all of the songs are in non-aggressive writing structures, just sub-par outputs where the band just lumped together some riffs and solos and just made a bland excuse for an album.\n\nCheck out a song like \"Refuse/Resist\" and you'll find that they totally mellowed out, which isn't totally a bad thing, just a sad ending to a legend that turned rancid. The guitars are thick, but the innovative riffs that were amongst them in their earlier days just are no more. I wouldn't consider the band to be called \"Sepultura\" because this is no Sepultura to me, et al. What counts here is music, but if you want to call it thrash metal, I think that it would be a mistake. They used to come up with the most intriguing and aggressive songs and yet they put out something like this. They should've just changed their name like Metallica should've.\n\nNo progression, just regression, stick with the old stuff. This is just a waste, you really have to be in the mood to listen to something mild, but even so, pretend that their name wasn't Sepultura. An evolution? A destruction. A destruction of talent that they once had, musically the album isn't an entire waste. I could tolerate 3-4 songs then I have to turn it off in utter dismay. Sad to hear such a great band that gave up in the thrash metal community. Many bands went to hell, but this decline was as obvious as I've said Metallica's decline as well. If you want heavy metal, I'd say this is more fits in that genre.\n\nThe music contains just bar chords slapped together with some severe solos, plus a bunch of acoustic riffs during some songs and overall an obliteration of the band. Maybe it's a money thing or maybe they ran out of ideas. It could be both, but now that Max is officially done with the band, I say RIP to them with vigor. Bands that don't decline over time are ones to follow with each succeeding album. But bands like Sepultura you never would expect a death (1st) metal origin, then thrash, then like groove metal. It's kind of weary and a waste, unless you feel like listening to half assed crap.\n\nDon't make a mistake and investing in this release because what you don't get is thrash metal, you get a non-super Sepultura. It's more like they as a band went to the grave with this one. Pardon the pun, but really, check out some songs on YouTube. If you like more groove oriented bands, this will hit home. But if you're expecting thrash metal, you won't get it here. It's completely non-existent. In all reality, we hear of Sepultura and think \"yeah, they rock the hardest!\" Well, \"Chaos AD\" doesn't rock if you expect like I said thrash, it's totally a decline and end of the band in general. So to me they're officially \"dead.\"\n",
        "\nDefinite a solid album with a newer version containing bonus tracks. So in actuality, if you purchase it nowadays, it will feature those bonus songs. Not as good as \"Beneath the Remains\", but still quality thrash from the legends themselves. Very good riff structures and intensity in playing. Max belting out some good, aggressive, and intense vocals alongside the rhythms that just plain kick ass. Technical, fast as all hell, with tempos varying, gallops exhibited, solos that are crazy by Andreas and the bass + drums fit in perfectly with this awesome release. So much energy and I wonder why their newer material they changed genres after Max left.\n\nYes you'll hear some great lyrics spewed out on this one, a true thrash metal conquered release. I'd have to say that it's difficult to compare this one from older recordings, but definitely much better than \"Morbid Visions\", even though they started off as a death metal band in the early days. \"Schizophrenia\" I did hear and was impressed, but still \"Beneath the Remains\" is my favorite. There's many reasons for that, but let's talk about \"Arise.\" A lot of changing up in aggression, some songs are fast as hell such as track 1, but overall the changes are dramatic and wholly aggressive as all hell.\n\nGreat guitar work here, some like this album the most, but really, in all originality sense, \"Beneath the Remains\" is more original, \"Arise\" it seems as though I've heard some riffs very similar before, however, in overall estimation and criticism, I would say that \"Arise\" is definitely a Sepultura album not to leave out in your collection. Holy way better than \"Chaos AD\", a newer one by the band when Max was still around. But I think the band started off with dedication to their thrash metal genre, but diminished over the years. Kind of like some bands just changing genres to sell more records.\n\nIf you want an mostly original thrash album that is filled with utmost intensity, aggression, technicality, originality, and utmost speed, \"Arise\" hits home for you. YouTube songs try \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" and see what you think. I would say that Max and Andreas really put in a lot of time to make this album work so that Sepultura still can say that they have some albums that are definitely original and kick ass thrash metal. Andreas improved, his leads are less so on this one, but they still show his aggression and intensity along with technicality. There's some acoustic licks meshed in here as well.\n\nDefinitely don't leave this out of your thrash metal collection. I'd say that the production quality is superb, and all instruments were mixed well and nothing was left out. A dramatic and amazing concoction of songs and music that just damper your eardrums to the core. I think the band hit it's peak here, then went on that gradual decline like I said. So in effect, \"Arise\" would be the best overall thrash metal album that measures up to Sepultura's longing talent, a talent that dissipated over the years, and to me and other fans of the band, are to hold in a precious memory. So as far as what I think here, \"Arise\" hits home in all aspects. Get it now, you won't regret it!\n",
        "\nAbsolute amazing thrash metal release here from Brazilian natives. The band capitalized on originality in songwriting, creativity, aggression, intensity and destruction of the senses. Out of their entire discography, none of their albums dominated as much as this one has. The production did them a great justice with everything properly mixed in the recording. Nothing was left out here and the guitar riffs simply dominated. Lyrical concepts were also a milestone here, reflecting the bands' struggle in to fit into society. They really belted out sheer intensity and aggression here, no words could describe such amazing work as this one.\n\nThe entire album is noteworthy, Max leading the way and Andreas simply dominating in the lead department. What's most reflective here is the band's simple desire to create such unimaginably creative riff structures. Tremolo picking galore alongside chunky and thick bar chord mania. The leads really augmented the rhythms, they were crazy fast and technical plus they did not drown out the rhythms. Max's vocal outputs were really aggressive and featured some backups from the band during some chorus parts. YouTube \"Inner Self\" and \"Mass Hypnosis\", they are I think the most noteworthy gems on this release.\n\nI like it how they progressed from Morbid Visions (their debut), Schizophrenia (predecessor) and with this one I think is their strongest release entirely. Amazing how they got all of this work recorded in merely a couple of days time! Like I said, everything fit together in unison and Beneath the Remains is an example of how bands should be original in their outputs and the importance of having a good production to augment the talent in the songwriting. Every single song dominates and is original sounding, nothing here was left out and as a 4-piece band I think they were their strongest in my estimation.\n\nEven bass bits were amazing, Paulo showing his talents in this department featuring a notable tapping outro riff and Igor definitely up to par on his drum bits. Sad about Sepultura's demise, here they worked so hard to get everything perfect and the band I no longer am interested in since Max is no longer with them. Sure they made some great efforts following this release including Arise and Chaos AD, but Beneath the Remains I think is their strongest ever because of their intensity and simple originality in songwriting style. The band as a whole did their absolute best work here, and that can't be stressed enough.\n\nI loved the clean intro to this album and everything after. Every single song shows utmost talent and superiority with the band, simply unbelievable. A true masterpiece on every front. The guitars (including the bass), the drums and production quality. Max's vocals fit the music totally and his aggression alongside the guitar riffs turned out amazingly. Some vocal effects, but they didn't overuse technology as some bands have over the years. Thrash metal here as strong and amazing, get the remastered version, it does the album justice. Old Sepultura is dead, long live old Sepultura! Own this now!\n",
        "\nSepultura\u2026 Yeah, that band really meant something back in the early 90\u2019s. They were one of the first extreme metal bands, which I started to listen to and which I became fan of (and when I started to learn how to play guitar I played maniacally some of their songs, trying to play them as fast as Cavalera and Kisser\u2026 sick!). They were also a mandatory band for all metal maniacs here in Poland; whether you preferred death or thrash metal, you would always like Sepultura. There was something unique about this band; maybe it was because where they came from, or maybe just because they were very talented musicians\u2026 all in all, there was no metal fan back then, who wouldn\u2019t have their cassettes in collection (CDs were still a rare thing)! Nowadays it is obviously different, the band is barely a shadow or caricature of what they once have been, in my opinion, their last really killer album for me is \u201cArise\u201d\u2026 Yeah, an album from 1991! But this is exactly the same what I can say about Slayer or Metallica. The last really good albums of all these bands have been released in 1991, sorry to say so\u2026 ever since then all these bands started to play something what I cannot stand at all. Anyway, speaking about Sepultura I can even tolerate the modern metal they did on \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d and the tribal metal of \u201cRoots\u201d, but to see this band without Max Cavalera behind the microphone is just enough and beyond my tolerance. For me this band doesn\u2019t exist for almost 20 years now. Anyway, I still like to listen to some of the old Sepultura records and this week I decided to play a record, which I haven\u2019t listened to for something like 15 years. This is Sepultura\u2019s classic debut LP \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d. It is not the album, with which I started to listen to this band back in 1991, it was \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d, but obviously I also had \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d in my tape collections. Nowadays I have it on vinyl, the old Roadracer version, which comes with \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d MLP as a bonus, so it is a great collector\u2019s item for sure. And despite having so many years, this vinyl still plays great. And despite not listening to it for so many years, I still remember every sound from it perfectly.\n\nIn my humble opinion \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d is not the best Sepultura LP, maybe it is only like my third favourite \u2013 after \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d and \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d (and who knows, maybe I also prefer \u201cArise\u201d over it??). Anyway, it definitely is an album, which can be called classic and cult release. Recorded back in 1986 (and \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d MLP back in 1985) it was one of the first as harsh, as raw and obscure, relentless and brutal, evil metal releases of all time. In my opinion it is even more aggressive and darker than \u201cSeven Churches\u201d and for sure it equals such classics as \u201cEndless Pain\u201d, \u201cBathory\u201d, \u201cShow No Mercy\u201d, \u201cHell Awaits\u201d or \u201cIn the Sign of Evil\u201d.\n\nThere are two things, which I need to point out about \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d. First of all, it is the production of this album. I must say that it is not my favourite sound, Sepultura sounds terribly messy and poor here, sometimes it almost feels like the band was just loosing the rhythm, played terribly uneven or something, creating a chaos and distortion. But despite that, it all seems fine anyway. Why? Well, it is because of the songs, which are on \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d. To be honest with you, you\u2019ll find here some of the most memorable and classic riffs / songs of all time, when speaking of such extreme death / black / thrash metal. Track number three \u2013 \u201cTroops of Doom\u201d \u2013 is the most obvious example. For sure it is one of the most memorable and classic Sepultura songs ever, I especially like its opening theme, with that fantastic and catchy riff; oh, what a characteristic and timeless tune! It is almost pity that such an excellent riff is so short and will not be repeated later in the song, as it soon speeds up and gets way more extreme than this memorable opening part. But extreme is almost the entire album, often it is just incredibly fast and I can say that it is probably one of the fastest and most intense LPs of the time of its original release. And it is just great that all this relentlessness comes in hand together with catchy riffs, memorable choruses and just great songs \u2013 my favourites along with the one, which I mentioned already, would definitely be the title track (\u201cMorbid Visionnsssss\u201d \u2013 scream!), \u201cCrucifixion\u201d (oh, what a massacre!!), \u201cShow Me the Wrath\u201d, \u201cFuneral Rites\u201d (which has a lot of similar patterns to \u201cTroops of Doom\u201d, really)\u2026 All have some absolutely amazing parts and each also has that kind of chorus, where you just must join Max Cavalera and just scream the texts! I love them all, Sepultura created an evil and obscure atmosphere like no other band around and it just sounds great, even if that production could have been better (for instance I think I prefer the sound of \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d little bit more). And besides, just listen to Max Cavalera\u2019s voice \u2013 he does sound like a ghoul here (and his lyrics were all about the dark stuff: satanic, death, violence, rituals\u2026 classic metal stuff, far more what I like than reading about some Brazilian tribes living in the jungle or the police violence).\n\nAnd speaking of \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d, this EP has been added to \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d LP re-release from Roadracer and it is great, as this EP contains such classics as \u201cAntichrist\u201d and \u201cNecromancer\u201d \u2013 another classic Sepultura tunes. And who cares if the artwork for this MLP is just primitive and childish and the logo is awful? This is a killer beginning of a legendary band (which luckily soon changed their logo for the one from \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d- and it is one of the best logos EVER!). Musically I guess \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d feels slightly more thrashy and not as obscure and aggressive as the full length album (did they sound more like Sodom or is it just me??), but obviously it also was pretty damn violent and crude stuff.\n\nIn the end I must say that I cannot imagine a metalhead, who doesn\u2019t own \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d. This is one of those classic records, which are mandatory and which will always be praised. And who cares if the album may seem to get old quite badly and feels very, very archaic nowadays? I surely don\u2019t, as this is why it also has a specific charm, feeling and atmosphere, which nowadays are almost impossible to capture.\nStandout tracks: \u201cTroops of Doom\u201d, \u201cCrucifixion\u201d, \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d, \u201cShow Me the Wrath\u201d, \u201cFuneral Rites\u201d\nFinal rate: 85/100\n",
        "\nAmong the early pioneers of the death metal sound, Brazilian thrash maniacs Sepultura naturally shared a fairly close stylistic relationship with that of Possessed and Death, thus putting forth a sound that is often considered more of the thrash persuasion rather than that of death metal. Their stylistic evolution tended to resemble that of Possessed a bit more, as their progression from \"Morbid Visions\" onward brought them closer to the dominant sound of the general Bay Area scene, thus culminating in a famous collaboration with studio magician Scott Burns, another figure very important in the development the characteristic sound of death metal. The level of production clarity, punch and muscle behind their 3rd and heavily lauded LP \"Beneath The Remains\" is undeniably masterful, but manifests itself as something not quite as overtly nasty and menacing as what would be heard out of Burns on his work with Cancer and Cannibal Corpse.\n\nAs an album, this thing is heavily tilted towards the complex, fast-paced, machine-gun riffing approach typical to bands such as Vio-Lence and Dark Angel at around this juncture. In fact, apart from a deeper, slightly nastier vocal display out of Max Cavalera that somewhat resembles the earliest work of David Vincent at times (before he became a bellowing bullfrog), this listens dangerously close to a Bay Area thrash album. The riff work is possessed of a similar combination of deep, rapid chugs and little melodic motives that graced the rugged, bone-crunching work heard on \"Eternal Nightmare\" and \"Leave Scars\", throwing in a near equally heavy hint of Slayer's dissonant tremolo riffing and haunting harmonic contour. But even more indicative of the heavy tilt towards San Francisco brand thrashing is the lead guitar work, which is remarkably similar to the absolute mastery displayed out of Flynn and Demmel on the aforementioned Vio-Lence debut.\n\nArguably, this is the least death metal informed album on Sepultura's early catalog, though the same ear shattering guitar sound and crisp vitality that was typical of a Burns production job is easily heard from one song to the next. Right from the reverb drenched acoustic intro of \"Beneath The Remains\", an inescapable sense of inevitability paints the landscape, one loaded with battle dead corpses under a blackened, smoke-filled sky. But after the first electric guitar begins pounding away, this album proves to be a constant barrage of heavy fire, like an artillery division with an endless supply of munitions and tireless robotic soldiers. An occasional breakdown to half-tempo may commence from time to time, but they are fast fleeting. It becomes impossible to really pick an obvious standout track when looking to the most exaggerated display of unfettered rage as an example, though \"Sarcastic Existence\" and \"Hungry\" do distinguish themselves nicely in how they balance out catchy, melodic guitar motives with gut-wrenching power chord mayhem.\n\nOne could liken this album to a berserker leading the charge amid an entire legion of battle-hungry Vikings, and that is the one area where this album falls a tiny bit short of its predecessor \"Schizophrenia\". This album is basically a straight-shot of extreme violence, one that casts aside any notion of nuance or subtlety. By no means it fall short of deserving all the praise it has garnered, and it definitely is far more accessible to the average thrash maniac than the low-fidelity character of the band's mid-80s sound. It's out on the front lines and its incredible ferocity will assure it a very high body count, but it isn't quite the album that commands the brigade.\n",
        "\nWhilst Sepultura\u2019s previous two albums (Morbid Visions from 1986 and Schizophrenia released in 1987) were popular amongst underground tape traders, the thrash world at large had ignored them. This was largely down to the fact that the distribution of these records had no clout but it has to be said that the quality of the song writing and the buzz saw production had put them in the third division of thrash metal and that\u2019s being particularly generous. Enter legendary thrash producer Scott Burns, the man who had worked his magic on Obituary, Atheist and the outstanding Death albums. His clean production savvy combined with Sepultura\u2019s ever confident and more mature song writing would have increased their standing for sure but it was singer and guitarist Max Cavelera who brokered the deal with Roadrunner Records which gave them the financial backing to break into metal\u2019s elite and have the Brazilian noise merchants gain the popularity that Beneath The Remains deserved.\n\nI bought this originally on cassette which just isn\u2019t the greatest format to listen to it on. I always preferred to listen to tapes of my favourite albums on my Walkman that I would dub from vinyl. Beneath The Remains simply got side-lined for a good few months. Gradually though the hooks took hold. The opening line from Inner Self; \u201cWalking down these dirty streets with hate in my mind\u201d and its memorable chorus was the first inklings for me that this band could become something quite special. Walking home from a school I hated to a home I feared with these Brazilian nutcases pumping thrash metal in my ears eventually took its toll. I became a fan.\n\nMass Hypnosis was another stomper, the main guitar line cuts through with jagged stabs that simply entice you into the grooves. Where metal acts such as Suicidal Tendencies were going wrong, Sepultura seemed to be getting right. A prime example is the full pelt thrash of Slaves Of Pain, rather than ignoring their past and reinventing themselves as something adjacent to what they originally planned to be here Sepultura encompassed the pace of their previous output whilst improving their song writing and song structure, throwing in a great breakdown part and they even began playing with vocal textures. They made what was an otherwise middle of the road album track something special. Suicidal\u2019s reinvention was simply too mainstream, what was a new outlook for them had already become an old pair of jeans for us local metalheads. Sepultura were leading the way forward.\n\nToday I have a lot of respect for Sepultura. Along with Pantera they kept metal interesting during the grunge years. Of course many would argue that Machine Head should be name checked in the same breath but they didn\u2019t have the same strengths or vision that the aforementioned bands had. Beneath The Remains for me was the curtain call of thrash metal. Thrash became over saturated and weak and died the same time as the hair bands did. Until it\u2019s recent re-emergence I thought that thrash\u2019s final page had been written with this record but as it turned out bands like SSS, Municipal Waste and Evile have rekindled the flame. Thrash metal is dead\u2026. Long live thrash.\n",
        "\nComedian Bill Hicks put forth one of the most direct and ironically compelling arguments for the decriminalization of marijuana when he said \"You're wrong, stop your internal debate right now!\". It's the sort of bold, cutting through the rubbish assertion that is always appropriate when something is so obvious that any appeal by an opposing view for evidence is tantamount to insulting everyone's intelligence. In the same respect where Sepultura's body of work goes, \"Arise\" stands as the last bona fide metal album to be released under the moniker, any further internal debate regarding the utter garbage that followed it being thus foolhardy and unnecessary. It might be harsh and there will likely be those who simply can't stand the idea of dismissing over 2 decades of studio output since, but it's the cold hard truth, take from it what one may.\n\nIn similar fashion to a number of parallel thrash metal albums in the early 1990s, \"Arise\" is an album that clearly remembers the basics of how to throw the vertebrae out of alignment, but opts for an approach that seeks to control the intensity and the frequency of neck-breaking mayhem with strategically place groove elements, owing in large part to the growing influence of Slayer's \"South Of Heaven\", Metallica's \"...And Justice For All\" and Exhorder's \"Slaughter At The Vatican\". But where it differs from all these other albums is that the aesthetic comes much closer to the emerging death metal explosion of the 90s, particularly in so far as the combination of deeper, more percussive guitar quality and Max Cavalera's grunting vocal style, which has more in common with Chuck Schuldiner and David Vincent than it does with the gruff shouts of Hetfield or Araya. The input of Scott Burns into the overall mechanics of this beast is very noticeable, as it hints at that familiar blend of pounding fury and reverberating mystique common to his work with Deicide and Obituary.\n\nIt has been stipulated by some that circa 1990-91 when this album was being conceived that the band was running out of ideas, but that notion doesn't really hold up when considering a lot of the really advanced songwriting ideas and nimble riff work going on from one song to the next. Admittedly, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that they were running out of steam when trying to square all of the slower sections of this album, the occasional acoustic guitar passages, and the growing amount of ambient interludes mixed into the fray with the unrelenting fury that was \"Beneath The Remains\", particularly when this album begins with a machine gun blast of death thrashing intensity that is the title song \"Arise\", cutting the listeners head off in just over 3 minutes with a similar brand of mayhem to what was heard on this album's predecessor. But even when dealing with the more moderated thrashers on here like \"Altered State\", it's very clear that any slowing down to a mid-paced groove doesn't exude a sense of fatigue after 3 undeniable classic full lengths before this one, but rather displays a denser layering of creativity that, while not quite as berserk as its predecessors, is a worthy endeavor by all standards.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult thing to fathom about this album is how it managed to share the same band as the lump of holiday coal and shit that was \"Chaos A.D.\", to speak nothing for the sonic dung factory that this band would become soon after. With bands like Kreator, Testament and Overkill it's easy to see where the path of stylistic evolution ended up, but the sheer 180 that occurred after this album is only really rivaled by Anthrax's 100% embracing of grunge on \"Sound Of White Noise\", and in no way should this album be associated with the next 2 that just so happened to share the exact same line up of musicians. Just the adventurous and technical lead guitar work on \"Under Siege\" alone tells a very different tale from the mess of noise that passed for a guitar solo in the mid 90s groove scene, one where a logical progression of ideas and the occasional flash of virtuosity leaves the listener anxious to hear the song all over again just to hear 20-30 seconds of high end fret board showmanship.\n\nNewcomers to the thrash metal style who may have discovered the genre through bands like Evile or Violator will find a sound here that's a bit darker and brutal, but still something close enough to the vintage mid 80s sound being rediscovered of late to rope in most of them. It would actually be interesting to have a younger version of Scott Burns emerge in the current revival craze to bring back the sound that made Cancer and Massacre short-time contenders in a crowded field of aspiring death thrashers looking to move the beast pioneered by Possessed into the 1990s. Music, like a number of things, tends to go in circles, and Sepultura's \"Arise\" wouldn't be a bad point in the curved path to revisit for a year or two, either through emulation via new bands or by discovery of this album by a younger crowd.\n",
        "\n\"Waa, we want Max! Waaa!\" \n\nI knew nothing about Sepultura before purchasing Against. All I knew was that they were a metal band based out of Brazil, and had just parted ways with their overrated frontman - Max Cavalera. Before I begin to give my input on Against, I must say that by this time, I've listened to just about every single Sepultura album. Captivated by the praise that \"true\" Sepultura fans (yeah... right!) have given their messiah Max, one couldn't help but to give Max-era albums a try! Whether it be generic thrash (Arise), generic groove metal (Chaos AD) or just plain shit (Roots) it is quite apparent that Max lovers will purposely neglect anything without their golden boy, even if that means the band releases the album that single-handedly describes who they are.\n\nWhen I say this album single-handedly describes who Sepultura is, I say it because the album amalgamates everything they had done previously and it incorporates elements that had yet to be done. But this time around, the album actually finds a way to keep the listener interested until the end. The music describes where they come from, and when I say that I mean I find myself somewhere in the Amazon rainforest or in some crazed favela. The drumming is what truly carries this album, and I don't necessarily just mean Igor Cavalera, it's all the other percussion that is involved that bears the band's signature South American/tribal sound (Floaters in Mud, Tribus, Unconscious, etc). The guitars vary like no other on this record, on songs such as Against and Hatred Aside, there is a very raw and thrash-like feel to the sound. During Old Earth, the sound is very heavy and simple paving way for the drumming to shine.\n\nOf course the biggest question mark surrounding this album was none other than Derrick Green. In my opinion, his presence is really what carries the songs. His style is very unique, there are moments in which he displays a very atmospheric and mysterious vocal performance (on songs such as Old Earth and Unconscious). There are also times when he has a very hardcore and/or Fear Factory-styled screams (Boycott, Common Bonds).\n\nAgainst is Sepultura's greatest accomplishment creativity-wise. Sadly all the fans that had a hard-on crush for Max Cavalera dispersed c. this time period and began listening to his new project featuring Limp Bizkit, Soulfly. In short, Against is unique, different, and underrated.\n",
        "\n'Against' is the first Sepultura record without Max Cavalera. New vocalist Derrick Green had too big boots to fill up, because with his great raspy voice and big character, Max also took his guitar playing with him when he left. Max formed Soulfly, but I have to admit I've heard a few songs only and they didn't convince me (Soulfly already have three albums out).\n\nOn 'Chaos A.D.' the band took a few steps away from thrash metal. The trend continued with 'Roots' and now with this one. What Sepultura have lost are the riffs. The music is very rhythmic. Over the heavy rhythm section, guitars are just \"wanked\" on and on. I mean Andreas Kisser seems to like more of the weird and tortured sounds his guitar make than a good, memorable riff. The most memorable parts seem to come from the rhythm section altogether. The songs vary from punky ones to, well \"jungle-ish\" ones and then Korn-ish \"mud\". There are a lot of guests on this album, most notably Jason Newsted, Gordo of Ratos De Por\u00e3o and Japanese KODO drummers. I have to admit flutes and stuff are used well to create South American atmospheres. I just wonder why the band has now taken these Japanese influences. I don't mean they're bad, but has the band run out of fresh ideas?\n\nMr. Green doesn't sound as pissed off as his predecessor, nor does he possess same level of charisma. He does his job okay, but my memories just disturb the whole listening session, whether it's the music or the vocals. And while the music is partly very angry, it is just not same it used to be. The sound is organic and very heavy. This helps to some extent, but of course its the music that should rule, eh?!\n\nIt's truly a sad direction the band have decided to move to. Gone are the true metal spirit and the ability make a great song. No matter how hard I try to like this album, only a few of the songs seem to be something more than just uninteresting and bland. Easily the worst album by Sepultura to date. And what I've heard of Soulfly, it's not a million miles away from this... The split destroyed this great band. I just wonder how many new fans of the band, who have bought this first, like the older classic records (which for me are 'Beneath the Remains', 'Arise' and 'Chaos A.D.')?!\n\n(originally written for ArchaicMetallurgy.com in 2002)\n",
        "\nAfter reading several reviews of this album (both positive ones and negative ones) I can conclude that several things of this release are quite overlook. Be it repetitive riffs or lack of virtuoso soloing or conventional \"metalness\" if you will, this does not take away from the sound at all. This album is indeed overwhelmingly metal. \n\nIf you are indifferent about sounds from other countries, be it the folk music of those nations or the tribal music of those nations, stay away from this album at all costs. Obviously you're gonna get the sound of Sepultura's origin. And goddamn is it a great sound. Sepultura explicitly mark their territory when it comes to the uniqueness of their brand in metal. What's definitely one of the best aspects of this album is the percussion. Igor Cavalera did an exceptionally superb job with his percussive delivery and the combination of tribal percussive instruments along with his own drum kit. \"Roots Bloody Roots\", \"Rattamahatta\", \"Breed Apart\", and \"Attitude\" are among the greatest percussive tracks of this album. If you're a drummer and you enjoy multiple brands of metal, never hesitate in buying this album or listening to it anyway you can. \n\nAndreas Kisser's soloing or exceptional guitar work does not exactly become a focus or an outstanding aspect of this release but it is definitely consistent and it blends well with the rest of the album's sound. Yes, while Max's lyrics aren't optimal, his vocal delivery impresses regardless. \"Jasco\" is definitely a track where Andreas' guitar playing stands out the most. It is definitely a song that stands out and gives a nice extra acoustic flavor to the album.\n\nSomething that I really loved, being a bassist, is the production of this album. The bass is pretty damn loud! this really made the album all the more enjoyable for me. \"Lookaway\" for me is the with the best bass groove in it. Ross Robinson as well as the rest of the staff involving the album's production definitely deserve a thumbs up. \n\nSomething that I found absolutely laughable was the way that so many complained about this album being \"nu-metal\" influenced. From what I hear, Max didn't quite write douchebaggy lyrics and not every track in this album had turntables other than \"lookaway\". Sure, you can definitely see some korn influence when you talk about the downtuning, but damn it's nowhere near being a important focus of the album. The percussion is definitely much more of a focus in this album rather than any nu-metal or metal specific influence. This album takes a little bit of everything and pretty much combines it with Sepultura's roots. \n\nOverall: An underrated album among thrashers and extreme metal fans. Definitely deserves different perspectives and extra listens.\n",
        "\nDespite how dull this album is, it has trumped everything Sepultura has done for a long time. From \"Spectrum\" and its cryptic opener to the well-rounded, thrash-friendly production job, Sepultura have created something padded but listenable. After all these years of bomb after bomb toying with the worst tough guy groove and dick posturing hardcore, the band finally achieves... mediocrity. Bask in it, Sepultura, you've earned it.\n\nThose looking for a more thrash-sounding Sepultura should (in theory) love this album as if it was some weirder continuation of old. The band tries what Dante XXI did by throwing in metallic hardcore and proper thrash to create something intense once again. The clearer production throws out that muddy sound that A-Lex had. Despite the number of energetic riffs, hooks, and pummeling drums, this album rarely reaches a level that surpasses plodding. The title track's harmonics, the melodeath tendencies (very In Flames influenced) of \"Dialog\", and the Kreator-edginess of \"Seethe\" and \"Mask\" create diversity that was missing for quite a while. None of it is fantastic, but it finally shows the band breaking out of their slump.\n\nOnly two things have shown no improvement. One, of course, is Derrick Green and his pathetic harsh yelling. The man has been in the band since the '90s and he still has the same coarse vocals barking ridiculous lyrics. His strengths as a vocalist are very poor, and once more they bring down the rest of the music. His simplicity is only matched by the number two issue - the plainness of these songs. Kairos is a better album than before, but it's still tedious as hell. Even the Ministry cover, an industrial classic, becomes plodding, uneventful rubbish. In between these short filler tracks are even shorter filler tracks that try to create an atmosphere of dread. They fail, and accomplished nothing but satisfying Sepultura's need for albums with too many tracks.\n\nA real comeback is impossible at this point, but if there is anything resembling even the faintest hints of one, then Kairos is it. It's the Sepultura that Sepultura were too afraid to comprehend back on Dante XXI. It's the one that has some sort of dignity as it begins to distance itself from the tired groove from before. It's the one that can lead to something more respectable in the future. It doesn't have to be another Beneath The Remains, but please just let it be something good.\n",
        "\nDerrick Green is a nutter. His forced harsh yelling should be at home with the foul guitar tone and fast tempos, but they aren't. They have never been essential or compatible with the unchanged bro-groove the band has stuck with for release after release. From the thrashier \"Moloko Mesto\" to the immediate switch back to groove-dom in \"Filthy Rot\", Green's Fear Factory-copied spits, barks, and attempts at cleans suck the passion out of anything the rest of the music is attempting to do.\n\nThen again, whatever the music tries to accomplish is almost always in vain anyway. What derails Sepultura's progression back into thrash territory is this inherent need to imitate angst and stick with the underground by putting on this fake fuck the system act. They pull this off by rehashing the exact same ideas since Roots with typically one or two mediocre riffs within the same inbred extended family of riffs as \"jumpdafuckup\" (with a little more metal sprinkled over it). The guitar tone is usually charred and fat, as it is here with some added polish like Dante XXI. The bass always follows suit since it dropped trying to be funky, instead going for complete heaviness under the guitars. The whole sound is dirty, simplistic, and unexciting, going on forever and ever because Sepultura pad their albums with so many songs.\n\nSongs like \"What I Do!\" wouldn't be god awful if the band pursued the middle eastern type of melodies with proper songwriting. But everything boils down to the same clamoring drums and churning guitars with Green's retarded yelling. From a very skewed view this album also achieves a crust punk sound like with \"Metamorphosis\" and \"Paradox\", but once more this is dependent on the listener and the band fails to take advantage of it. Actually, Sepultura never ditched their lifeless brand of hardcore when Green was added. The difference is that Dante XXI tip-toed into metallic hardcore while A-Lex rummages through bad riffs and worse songs as it tries to capture the same apocalyptic atmosphere.\n\nThis album can't be a disappointment after a large run of awful Sepultura albums. From the new drummer's misplaced energy to the stock songwriting to the recycled riffs and polished production, this band has made another worthless album. There are very few levels of the experimentation that kept these albums even a little intriguing to some. Better to prefer the straightforward songs than that experimentation, though, or else the band gets cocky and records something like \"Ludwig Van\" - a miserable attempt at fusing bad groove with \"9th Symphony\" and having it go absolutely nowhere. A-Lex, congratulations on existing with no purpose except confirming Sepultura's continuing suckage.\n",
        "\nWhether or not they are groove, hardcore, nu-metal, or thrash riffs, there are some good riffs here. Even more unbelievable is that they're part of songs that are pretty good, too. Nothing stellar, but on a Sepultura level, they were the best material the band was capable of creating in a decade. That's where this album has an advantage over the previous albums. There's an increased level of productivity and efficiency in the writing. Now of course this varies from song to song, and Sepultura can never help but pad their albums with filler after filler on proportions that surpass that of mind-numbing (just not as far as before).\n\n\"Ostia,\" \"Crown And Miter,\" and (to some extents) \"Nuclear Seven\" and \"Convicted In Life\" are what make Dante XXI stand out. The fervor of thrash metal with the bitterness and crunch of metallic hardcore can be heard, and that's the difference between intensity and the meandering shallowness of Sepultura's angsty groove formula. These four songs show Sepultura in some kind of revival with a coarser guitar tone richly executing vicious riffs. Bass follows the guitars with fatness and desiccated heaviness under a polished production job. The groove aspect with slappy bass lines and that massive layering had started to become phased out. \n\nThis shift toward a harder edged sound was the right move, but looking at the whole picture shows a band still in a rut. Musically they've progressed in a direction that stuck to proper utilization of riffs and a darker atmosphere, but they only tapped into it. That's why overall this album is a failure. It brought in a rougher approach to the tough guy groove and morphed it into musky imitation of thrash and proper hardcore. That aspect can be enjoyable, but the core of Dante XXI is still firmly rooted in that bro music. That means more tracks than not that are devoted to the stale, caveman groove from before.\n\nFollowing the aforementioned points, the one that made no improvement is Derrick Green. This jackass has the most primitive, emotionless yell I've heard in these type of genres. They're the same dry harsh-yelling spouting the dumbest shit. They always bring the music down no matter what other percussion fills or downtuned rummaging is going on. His vocals consume the charred tone, the assaulting drums, the floundering tempos, and the rehashed ideas because their prominence dictates what goes on. He's such an integral part of what has ruined this band that there's no way these guys have a chance in hell of surpassing one song off of the late '80s / early '90s material (let alone one whole album from that era).\n\nThat is, unless \"Still Flame\" is brought into the equation. You want a throwback to Roots' lame tribal experimentation, then this is an experimentation gone wrong. Expect tribal, expect bad vocal repetition of a couple words, some folk melodies, and dull electronic beats. Despite what meandering, dark atmosphere it invokes, it's a track that is so ill-fitting and boring on fast and loud album like this. Hearing this reminded me of Cavalera on the rest of the album. For his last offering to this decimated band, he gives an energetic performance. The kit sounds ripe and he rolls and pounds as well as the refined production allowed him. Fine, but it was no tremendous step up from what the last few albums demonstrated. His final albums for Sepultura culminated in an album that has him doing what should have been minimal to his skills. Instead, years of subpar, stock drumming became his standard. That's why this one feels like it's miles ahead of the few peers before this.\n\nSo yes, compared to Roots through Roorback, Dante XXI is impressive. It's impressive in that it shows a band trying to get better. It has Sepultura breaking out from their obsession with bad riffs and dick-posturing for some music that lets loose a little. It's a Sepultura that breaks off from the previous era and leads into another. Whether they take advantage of this risk or not is up to them. They were dumb enough to write and record Roots through this album, though, so hell no.\n",
        "\nThis album has a guitar tone that's flat as fuck. It's a distortion that rarely has any competent, aggressive riffs behind it. This groove garbage with the political angle and tinges of tribal moments reek of suck. Some band at one point or another pulled this kind of music off, but Sepultura are the wrong band to attempt this over and over again. This band loses every time with their boring, meandering brand of tough guy groove metal. Top it off with Derrick Green and his insipid yelling about corruption and war and it spells catastrophe.\n\nThe identity issues of groove / hardcore and tribal experimentation have diminished to the point of complete control by now. The band has for the most part been able to write those in where they don't derail the straightforwardness of these songs. The problem, as it was for the previous album, is that these songs define plainness. Nothing about them, despite having direction and a backing of a well-rounded, clear production job, gives me any favorable emotional reaction. These rhythms and groove riffs are the same nu-metal and falsified groove riffs that want listeners headbanging like monkeys instead of being invigorated. The volume of the riffs is loud because of the proper mixing, but their lasting power is minimal. The strength of these riffs is barely passable even on a groove metal level (even with all the clean sections and percussion fills to bounce ideas off of).\n\nStuff like \"Godless\" and \"More Of The Same\" gives the impression of an atmosphere of turmoil and energy to back it up. The reality is overblown usage of the same ideas that have been half-assed since Roots and tired, angsty aggression that becomes annoying. Other songs like \"Urge\" and \"As It Is\" are on the opposite end as they attempt to mold together riffs that conjure a sense of impending doom but fail to deliver on all fronts. Following the above idea, the album always feels like it gives up even though it tries to act like it doesn't. Take the bass and drums as an example of the rhythm letting the riffs whirl and crunch their way toward nothingness countless times while Green's barking and bland cleans have little to actually provoke. They'll noodle around with some breaks or percussion segments, but no matter how much they intend to take over, the formula of guitars and vocals directing the songs hampers progress. \n\nThe direction of this band shouldn't have turned into the most basic of rock music. Cavalera especially put nothing into his performance of tinny hits and the same cymbal pace from start to finish. He wants to sound like he hasn't lost his edge and rolls his double bass like he means business, but none of that matters when the rest of his playing is perfunctory. He'd bail late enough, but the rest of the band would carry on when they should have disbanded. With that said, a split at that time would've probably been the most remarkable idea this band had since their thrash days.\n",
        "\nClamoring drums start Nation off on a roll. Everything is present in one of the worst albums on such a level: tough-guy attitude, imitated hoarse yelling akin to mid-era Fear Factory, and lofty bass supporting the sleek, repetitive groove riffs that go absolutely nowhere. It's Sepultura at their most pitiful moment. Roots was a travesty that tried to show the band mating ideas that didn't match and Against tried to do the same (with more respect). Those albums showed Sepultura in an identity crisis as it mixed percussion and folk traits outside of metal into the dick-posturing genre that is groove metal (heavily laced with nu-metal and the wrong type of hardcore). \n\nGreen's vocals are passionless cleans and barks done without any lasting power. It's a Burton Bell imitation that's as commanding as simple exhales. Coarse yelling like this is too primal to add anything to an album that attempts to be more straightforward and less unorthodox than the previous two abominations. It serves as nothing more than emotionless coating to the crude guitar riffs sapping whatever life it can out of the polished production job. \"Border Wars\" is a prime example of this beaten formula of downtuned rock riffs, some kind of sprinkled edginess in the solos, pounding drums, and hip nu-metal rhythms. \"Sagas\" is another bastardized attempt at tin tribal percussion and a bouncy tempo trying to desperately get some heads to bang. It instead just plays unaware of how shameful such a combination is committed to songwriting with no depth.\n\nInstead of further subjecting itself to dissonance and unorthodox songwriting that backfires, Sepultura tries something else. They create songs that depend more on basic song structures. That means less experimentation and tribal elements on a level that breaks direction while keeping just varied enough to be classified as different songs. The problem is that as compositions, these songs are incompetent on every level. They are terrible excuses for groove metal with the degree of ineffectual riffs, uninspired vocals, and lack of bearing. By the very core, these songs define boring, unimaginative, and, as a result, they define unlistenable. This style sucks on its own, but Sepultura butchered it to a level where there is no way to enjoy anything about these songs.\n\nIt is unheard of how a band can take something that has proven to be marketable and turn it into something completely unlistenable. It's impossible to sit through any of these songs ever again. In life, this album will always be the antithesis of what can be appreciated in music. Now I know I hate Roots and Against, but fuck Nation. This is among the worst albums I've ever heard.\n",
        "\nSepultura with Derrick Green sucks so hard. Their talent in playing instruments means nothing if the music can't overcome the worst blend of styles. Roots was the drop-off of the band's legacy, so Sepultura tries to top it by heading directly into groove \"metal\" territories. Against is the first output of unresponsive, sterile music attempting to solidify the direction of Roots. It is, however, a more respectable take on that style (in that not as many riffs or parts in songs suck). \n\nOverall, Against is a very, very bad album. Sepultura's urge for primal, caveman aggression mixed with the lamest rock tendencies is one of the worst concepts for marketable music. The same spastic rage, socio-angst lyrics, groovy rhythms, and bass-heavy sound screams tough-guy posturing. This is Hatebreed-style hardcore merging with Fear Factory's tendency to cross into nu-metal territories at the closest. Riffs have the same downtuned simplicity every time and for every song that contain them. Green and his hardcore barking / callous singing style fits these rock songs perfectly. Both are unmelodic, both go for sleek presentation, they benefit from the album's glossy production, and both attempt to tap into the overly loud wailing of coarse guitar distortion, playful riffs, massive bass layering, and fat drums that try to act like an artillery battery. \n\nVariation is not a strong point for Against, and the \"tribal\" aspects and songs don't help this drawback because of the band's mishandling. Roots had this same issue where it tried to be experimental with the music, and this album does the same. Songs have industrial and tribal elements going in and out (\"Unconscious\" seems to be the only realistic blend), as well as weird breaks here and there to create dissonance and chaos. This doesn't work when such ideas are thrown in without properly writing around these ideas. Not only that, but the predominant musical genre itself is so shitty and uninspired to begin with that it makes it impossible to create anything catchy or impressive out of it.\n\nInstead of trying to break out of an identity crisis, the band further solidifies itself into one. More well-produced, bass-laden rock songs too inexcusable to sit through. They test the patience of the listener by veering off track and pummeling the same boring formula into the ground. Sitting through one song is a headache, but to subject oneself to the whole package is lunacy. This repetitive trash is beneath the term music and belongs in a void where no one will ever hear it.\n",
        "\nThis album is incredibly hard to sit through for even one song. The mixture of tribal percussion, angsty harsh yelling, groove-laced riffs, jumpdafuckup rhythms, and tough-guy attitude culminates in one of the worst assaults on the ears ever created. It's such a bad combination of the worst nu-metal posturing and least appealing type of metal aggression. On the other end of the album there's the worst execution of tribal elements on a metal album (even with a concluding track to sum up the band's wasted ambition). Sepultura's movement away from the realm of heavy metal left this shitstain - Roots - an overly long, super repetitive, ridiculously boring, and pathetically retarded musical product.\n\nEveryone sucks, from the band members to the accomplices that helped create such a whirlwind of muddy, monotonous songs. \"Roots Bloody Roots\" - a vanguard that represents the fat, polished grime defining almost every song thereafter - kicks off such an unnecessarily long album. There's no point in having this many tracks of mostly the exact same bland, coarse guitar tone messing with the same downtuned riffs in different variations. Under all of them is this backwash bass guitar tone that's massive. It serves not to play anything memorable (this album is devoid of competent riffs or solos), but to add a heavy layering. Everything is clear and fat like any modern album today would strive to be, so such bass support would work out. Despite a need to nail this particular sound so badly, the album causes this support to backfire by sounding quirky and unorthodox at times as it shifts identities over and over.\n\nForget the fact that this album has moved away from metal and represents a Sepultura transitioning into other genres. Why in the hell does the music end up so poorly? Even by the standards of a nu-metal / rock album, Roots is an embarrassment. Nothing intellectual was required, but to have lackluster experimentation push simplistic, sterile riffs into the most lifeless of uninteresting proportions with asinine lyrics to back it up is a complete failure. Max's awful caveman yells going in and out of distortion saying the stupidest shit gets annoying, as does every bit of this album's duration. The other Cavalera and his drumming sounds fine tone-wise, but the plainness of the beats and fills is a far cry from the relentless bashing of old.\n\nDon't expect anything catchy as much as something unproductive, aggravating, and derivative. Even the tribal elements or the \"folk\" aspect of this album (awkward to mix with such music to begin with) is executed in a disappointing way. There's no cohesion, nor is there any real identity or direction for the album. Just a bad concept of too many shitty ideas making their way onto one artifact.\n",
        "\nBack in '92, I desperately wanted to go see a Ministry/Helmet/Sepultura concert in New York City but couldn't make it happen. Being 14 at the time, I would've needed a ticket, a ride, and a fake ID because it definitely wasn't an all-ages show. But coming up with the above combo proved difficult and I ultimately had to abandon the idea (I've regretted it ever since). Afterwards a friend of mine who'd gone regaled me with tales about what an awesome show it was, how all three bands killed it, and how Sepultura got fans to rip the seats out of the front of the Paramount in order to get a pit started. Awestruck by how badass that seemed, I immediately went out and bought Arise. I'd had no exposure to Sepultura previously. Death metal at the time was a new and intriguing (not to mention frightening) genre for me but if they were cool enough to open for Ministry and Helmet, that was cred enough for me (though I kept the Arise artwork hidden from those whose prying eyes might mistake me for some kind of Satanist -- older rural minds being entirely closed to the symbolism and imagery of the nascent death metal scene).\n\nAt the time however, Arise didn't quite work for me, and it still doesn't entirely. It's a sick record loaded with clusterbomb fragments of sharp-tipped death-thrash but the balance weighs more towards Slayer and less towards those heavier, scarier bands I was discovering. It was fast but I'd heard faster. And it wasn't very heavy. Even to my then untutored ears, it doesn't sound all that good. Whether on my tiny cassette boombox or in my parent's fancy stereo, I always fucked with the EQ, trying to get it to sound thicker, heavier, and more evil. And these adolescent biases linger, in that I still think the Morrisound production job robs this record of much of its vitality. Attempting to sound dry and sharp, the band falls flat, punctured of the heft necessary to convey their darkened atmosphere. Take the heaving aggression of the Chaos A.D. production tone and retroactively place it on here and you'd get a better idea of what I was looking for. Alas, all of Sepultura's thrashterpieces sound less than stellar, a sad reminder that Scott Burns has as many botches as notches under his belt. \n\nThe songs themselves are good-to-great but again retroactive bias sets in. Compared to the live versions I have heard, some of these tracks move at half-speed. There is a distinct lack of energy, a passion I feel was vacuumed out of these tunes by Scott Burns, though the band themselves may have consciously slowed down a peg in the studio. I want these tunes to burn incandescent but they radiate more warmth than heat. That said, the band has firm chops and know how to write strong songs. The riffs from 'Arise,' 'Dead Embryonic Cells,' and 'Desperate Cry' are all catchy as fuck and the chorus to 'Dead Embryonic Cells' is embedded in my brain forever. These tracks front-load the album and the overall songwriting quality takes a dive afterward. 'Murder' and 'Subtraction' have always failed to connect. Both 'Altered State' and 'Under Siege' are epic, grandiose even, and a strong signal towards Sepultura's changing intentions: strong mid-paced riffs, chugging grooves, and broad dollops of both tribal and industrial influences that go a long way towards explaining Chaos A.D. Fun songs but I don't often hit repeat on them either. 'Meaningless Movements' is more mid-paced headbanger material, enjoyable but lacking sharper definition. 'Infected Voice' releases the record with a bang however, channeling the deep vibrational energies of the earth's darkest death-tinged thrash. \n\nIn the end, Arise maxed out Sepultura's then-current approach. Change was in the wind and as many fans fled as were gained. Depending on where you fall on the divide, Arise is either their last great gasp, a decent holdover before new inroads were made, or a moderately successful rehash of Beneath The Remains. Regardless, it has made a lasting impact and is a record I enjoy frequently despite whatever minor frustrations remain. Being caught between the bruising grooves of Chaos A.D. and the death perfection of Beneath The Remains is a dicey proposition for any record and Arise acquits itself admirably.\n",
        "\nOk, a lot of people is getting impressed with the new Sepultura\u2019s album, named Kairos. I do understand this surprise, because this album breaks a sequence of hardcore based albums released by the band in the past few years. Sepultura\u2019s music has passed through a profound transformation since Max Cavalera\u2019s departure in 1996. Kairos is definitely an attempt to bring back the aggressive and raw sonority the band had before Roots. So there are a few things to be said:\n\nHardcore and Tribal influences\nTalking about the music, since the first valid track (I mean, a non introductory track, because there are 3 of them, not to mention the covers) we see that Sepultura has left behind the tribal influences in this album. So, if you\u2019re expecting Brazilian native sounds like explored in the previous releases, you won\u2019t found them here. Kairos almost sounds like a pure thrash metal album. Of course there are tracks in which the hardcore influence is still perceptive, but as a whole, Kairos is much more similar to Arise and Chaos A.D. than Roots, Nation, Against or any other. \n\nSpeed and Riffs\nKairos is a fast album. At least when we compare it with other recent releases of the band. Songs like the album title, \u201cKairos\u201d, could be easily inserted in Chaos A.D. without disturbing the album sonority. The speed increases as the album advances. The riffs are more simple and, even with the fact they do not show anything completely new, are the clearest examples that Sepultura tried to go back in time. A proof is \u201cSethe\u201d which contains 10 seconds of pure Slayer influenced trash metal: fast and noisy. The other tracks are also rapid, like \u201cRelentless\u201d and \u201cMask\u201d, with good guitar variations. \n\nAndreas, Derrick and Jean, the new drummer Jean had the responsibility to replace one of the greatest metal drummers of all times, Igor Cavalera, and he surprised me for the good job done. It\u2019s precise, without much advanced technique, and what really matters, fits perfectly to what Sepultura intended, in my opinion, to sound like: a pure thrash/death metal band. So, do not expect to hear more than regular beats and double pedals. Derrick vocals, that I always considered poor, are pretty good in this album. They sound more strong and constant, not having volume and potency variations. But what is really worth to say is that finally Andreas Kisser has returned to the old great times of pure, creative and fast guitar solos! Ok, I\u2019m a fan of his work, but it\u2019s impressive the way he plays each of the tracks in Kairos, inserting more aggressiveness to the songs. Pay attention to what he does in \u201cKairos\u201d, \u201cRelentless\u201d and \u201cBorn Strong\u201d. \n\nSo, this new album is worthy to listen to, and shows a much more mature Sepultura, trying to recover its good old roots of thrash/death influences.\n",
        "\nLet me first start by saying that I WAS a massive Sepultura fan from long ago. Like Metallica, Iron Maiden and Anthrax, Sepultura was one of the first bands which got me into heavy metal and they\u2019ll forever hold a special place in my music collection for changing my life all those years ago. Firstly hearing \u2018Chaos A.D.\u2019 and then it\u2019s predecessors \u2018Beneath The Remains\u2019 and \u2018Arise\u2019 before \u2018Roots\u2019 was released, I remember back in 1996 when \u201cRoots Bloody Roots\u201d was my #1 song of choice for almost a year and it was pretty much all I listened to. Things change however, and to my horror in December 1996 I find out that Max Cavalera has left the band to form Soulfly and while my excitement and anticipation grew for Soulfly, it began to decline for Sepultura when \u2018Against\u2019 was released, about two years later.\n\nNot just me, but there was also a decline within the general population of Sepultura fans, with Max gone Sepultura and their music would not be the same. And it wasn\u2019t, there\u2019s no denying that; the Sep\u2019s presence in the metal world fell away quickly and years later looked like a fallen god, lost, weak and a shadow of their former selves. Vocalist Derrick Green is hands down a great singer, suited very well for what Sepultura were looking for as a replacement to Max, and overall a logical choice. His raspy, emotional and anger-tinged tones capture what Sepultura are about and without him behind the mic I do wonder how badly this band could have fallen.\n\nDespite the weaker calibre of albums post \u2018Roots\u2019, both \u2018Against\u2019, \u2018Nation\u2019 and possibly \u2018Roorback\u2019 still contained some weight and packed a punch, while \u2018Dante XXI\u2019 and \u2018A-Lex\u2019 were decent at best and really failed to make a huge impression. Some positives though, there were still plenty of gems to be found scattered throughout those 5 releases. The best of those include: \u201cChoke\u201d, \u201cAgainst\u201d, \u201cSepulnation\u201d, \u201cBorder Wars\u201d, \u201cCome Back Alive\u201d, \u201cMind War\u201d, \u201cConvicted in Life\u201d, \u201cBuried Words\u201d, \u201cWhat I Do\u201d and \u201cConform\u201d.\n\nSo then it became a big surprise to me when I was able to listen to the first single of Sepultura\u2019s latest album (their 12th) entitled \u2018Kairos\u2019, that being the title track of the album and my jaw literally dropping to the floor as the track was playing between my ears. There\u2019s something different about this Sepultura album was the first sensation I got from the single. Eager to get my hands on the new album to hear the entire disc, my first reactions were right. \u2018Kairos\u2019 is indeed different than the last few albums, there\u2019s a spark, a burning flame that I haven\u2019t felt in a Sepultura album in nearly 10 years.\n\nFor starters, they don\u2019t cram in the song-writing into a two minute track that sounds more like a crash \u2018n\u2019 bash session. Yes, there is one track which does go for 2:27, but that\u2019s the only one. The others (excluding the interludes) range between 3:30-4:30 and the song-writing is much better, where the band has allowed time to spread out and not go hell for leather for two minutes something and that\u2019s it. The tracks are also much more consistent than on recent albums, where pretty much every track is above average and contains much more grunt, groove and catchiness for the first time in a long time. This time round Sepultura have gone with quality over quantity and that is the biggest difference and improvement on this disc.\n\nSepultura have a great track record giving cover songs the Sep treatment; take a listen to \u201cThe Hunt\u201d, \u201cOrgasmatron\u201d, \u201cProcreation of the Wicked\u201d, \u201cSymptoms of the Universe\u201d and \u201cBullet the Blue Sky\u201d as previous examples. This time round on \u2018Kairos\u2019, Sepultura have covered Ministry\u2019s hit song \u201cJust One Fix\u201d (there is also a bonus track which is a cover of The Prodigy\u2019s \u201cFirestarter\u201d). Both covers are done quite well and it shows that Sepultura are not afraid to cover non-metal songs. But it\u2019s the original material that we are eager to hear about and I can confidently say that \u2018Kairos\u2019 is the most consistent and catchy Sepultura album in over 10 years. Possibly even their best CD in the Derrick Green era of Sepultura. I\u2019m not saying that they have gone back to their 90\u2019s greatness in sound, however listening to the album; the sound of \u2018Kairos\u2019 is a mixture of \u2018Nation\u2019, \u2018Roorback\u2019 and \u2018Dante XXI\u2019, but with more grit, more groove, more catchiness and also a new and improved change of direction of their song-writing. Whatever the change that was made, it has worked...finally. \n\n\u201cSpectrum\u201d is the CD opener and it is a powerful start to the album. With a classic old school thrashy guitar riff that is eventually joined by the bass guitar and then drums, the main melody rips into gear with Derrick\u2019s raspy vocals raining down with conviction. The beat/melody together is catchy as hell and you can\u2019t help but beat your head to. Eventually the riffs speed up towards the middle of the track before Andreas\u2019 guitar solo takes flight. It\u2019s a ripping start that every almost Sep fan can agree on. Another kick track on the album is the exceptional \u201cMask\u201d, being the one of the best and catchiest as well. Featuring a wicked groove/thrash metal riff during the verses and an aggressive and memorable chorus, the track is quite powerful, passionate and easily one of the best Derrick Green era Sepultura songs. Other tracks that will get the fist pumping and air guitars wailing would be the impressive dark tinged title track \u201cKairos\u201d, the strong and speedy \u201cRelentless\u201d, the infectious power grooves of \u201cBorn Strong\u201d and the thrashy aggression of \u201cNo One Will Stand\u201d.\n\nIn the end, I was left quite surprised of the quality of this album. Coming into it with not very high expectations, and really only listening to it out of respect for the band who helped get me into metal, I came away very satisfied and very impressed. Sepultura have released their best album in a long time and hopefully I am not alone with that opinion. Fans of the Sep\u2019s should give this CD a chance and they should not be disappointed, while fans of groove/thrash metal should also enjoy what is on offer here. It just goes to show that even without any of the Cavalera\u2019s, Sepultura can still produce an exceptional disc. That win goes to the massive improvement in the song-writing and here\u2019s hoping that \u2018Kairos\u2019 is a large stepping stone to even bigger things for this band.\n\nOriginally written for www.themetalforge.com\n",
        "\nThough a 'true' reunion with Max Cavalera has been in demand for many years, Sepultura is one of the few internationally renowned metal bands to have not repealed its new front man. You've got to admire such resolve, because the pressure must have been huge this past decade, with thrash coming back in full swing and lots of fans, old and new shelling out hard currency for new albums with classic lineups, reunion tours, etc. That being said, I've yet to hear a single Derrick Greene fronted Sepultura record which I could place upon the same plateau of quality achieved early on with albums like Chaos A.D., Beneath the Remains, and Schizophrenia.\n\nSure, they've tried, and individual tracks from albums like Nation and Against have had their moments, but it just doesn't seem to be working out for me. I just can't get into the guy's vocals. Technically, he's got a broader range of styles, yet I've felt as if the band were always missing something without Max's gruff if misguided presence. Kairos, the band's 12th album, is an appeal to the past, the band returning almost wholly to the simplistic thrash riffing that placed them on the map in the footfalls of Slayer, Possessed and other primal giants of the form. It's not so much a mirror into the band's 80s catalog as it is a second attempt at a Chaos A.D., and the decision to include various external influences (primarily industrial) into the social political, tribal and 'feel good' lyrics only reinforces its retread grounds.\n\nAlas, the Brazilian superstars have once again come up short, and Kairos is yet another quizzical full-length that begs the question: how does Sepultura sustain itself off about 15 years of middling and underwhelming composition? Are the classics still such huge hits on tour? Is the fan base in total denial? Did they invest in a successful stock portfolio in the mid 90s? To think, there is practically an entire generation now of fans who have grown up with Green. I guess the band must be doing something right, even if the quality of their output seems so borderline wrong...\n\nKairos does attempt to be that Sepultura record everyone's been waiting for since 1993 (or in the case of many Chaos A.D. haters, 1991). A few of the early birds (\"Spectrum\", \"Kairos\") have relatively hypnotic, basal mute thrash rhythms which build expectations rather high, and then defecate all over them, as they go basically nowhere. Green cycles between his emotionally charged, Phil Anselmo snarls, somber narrative tones, and the straight up caustic style which is his best, and the band just phones in a handful of primitive beats and rhythms which never build up enough fire to resurrect the momentum of yesteryear. There are some creative leads tossed about the track list, and a handful of curious riffs that rekindle the band's 1989-93 personality (like the ringing guitar line in \"Born Strong\"), but there never seems to be more than one, or possible two little rhythms worth a damn anywhere.\n\nLike Chaos A.D., there are the expectant moments of versatility and experimentation, manifest here through some minor ambient segues (\"2011\", \"5722\"), and industrial pieces: the first a cover of Ministry's \"Just One Fix\", plays rather close to the original version, with some South of Heaven-style leads thrown in at the end. The second, a Sepultura original called \"Structure Violence\" which blends the tribal, groove and industrial elements into what is at least the most interesting overall song on the entire album. But the remainder of the album is nothing more than the law of averages being spun repeatedly. \"Mask\" might have a decent riff tucked into its bridge, but in getting there one must survive its tedious grooves. \"Dialog\" opens with a latent melody to its muted, driving chords, but fails to flower into anything worthwhile. Then you have pieces like \"Seethe\", the same pedestrian hardcore/groove metal the band have been releasing to no avail for the decade before this.\n\nBy this point it must seem like I've a serious hate on for this album, but that's not at all the case. Kairos is not bad. In fact, it's mildly more appealing than the band's hot selling, tribal nu-metal effort Roots, and there are a half dozen riffs I could single out which would have been quite ace in a more potent environment (Max Cavalera vocals optional). The production does the album a measure of justice, being crisp and poignant, and Jean Dolabella attempts to keep the simplicity of the song structures adaptive and interesting with his drumming. But the music and lyrics are in general pretty undeveloped (like \"Mask\", which almost reads like a cheesy, preemptive backlash against the internet generation who have hounded the band for a decade), and at the most its a pale shadow of something like Chaos A.D., which was for its time felt so original due to the tremendous grooving force, and cultural and local political influence. Kairos is just kind of 'all right', and once again, that's just not enough.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhen Roots was released in 1996, I remember being truly excited. Chaos A.D. had been one of my favorite albums, maintaining a steady rotation in my car's cassette deck for well over a year. When a friend handed me a dubbed copy of their latest album, I was stoked. Popping it in the deck, I was immediately confused. Had this been mislabeled? Was this the new Korn album? Nope, that's Max. But seriously, what's up with this derivative sound? Whereas Chaos A.D. had nicely coupled stomping grooves with tribal polyrhythms and hardcore punk and thrash, Roots tipped that sound obscenely over into the groove category, with all the welcome diversity of their previous record snuffed out as well. What had been a perfected thin line of a new sound was now a blurry, muddy mess and Roots would prove to be a record from which Sepultura (and by association Soulfly) would never recover from.\n\nThe first major problem I have with this record is the production. The thickness of the sound, the guitar and bass tone, the drum placement -- all of it is a straight xerox of the production job Ross Robinson did for the first Korn album. People went crazy for that sound at the time but it was never a perfect fit for Sepultura as the nuances of the music are lost beneath an artifical glaze of assumed heaviness. The second problem I have is with the lazy, tired musical cliches that surface up from this ugly, over-produced muck. \n\nNow I have no real issue with the tasteful use of groove, and the incorporation of tribal elements into the Sepultura sound makes sense and should've been refreshing. But the songwriting here is tepid at best. When a track works, like the double-bass frenzy of \"Attitude\" or the menacing headbanger \"Roots Bloody Roots,\" the results impress. But those tracks are front-loaded for a reason. By the time the A-Side gives way to the B-Side, the well has run dry. Whatever interesting ideas the band had are irksomely re-hashed and recycled and this enervating sense of redundancy has kept me from ever listening to Roots all the way through. It just gets boring.\n\nWhat's worse is that the band experiments in ways that just get too far away from their core sound. A track like \"Lookaway\" with turntable scratches, hip-hop samples, and a Mike Patton/Jonathan Davis tag team is just blatant pandering at its worst. For a band once as innovative as Sepultura to hop the faddish bandwagon is just saddening. There's also an unflattering strain of angst-driven hardcore tough-guy emoting on the lyrical end that further demonstrates Sep ranging away from their basic metal templates. And while I think there's room for brief acoustic tribal jams, the back-to-back boredom of \"Jasco\" and \"Istari\" just sucks the life out of the record. These elements combine with the bad production and limpid songwriting to just drag Roots further down from disappointment to near-disaster. What's left is a mere handful of decent songs and a wrecked legacy that out-right ruined one of metal's most interesting and powerful creations.\n",
        "\nHow long has it been? What, 12-15 years since their last last buyable album in 'Roots'? I say buyable, but I saw that album as the one that started this downward trend for so many years. That nu-metal garbage that they practically created with 'Chaos A.D.' went full blown on 'Roots'. It apparently was a big genre for a while there, might still be if I look closely into it, but I don't want to torture myself. It's easy. It's the easy way out of actually having to write multiple riffs on one track like they did in the thrash metal days. Any moron can do it. Just down tune your guitar and start playing rhythm guitar all day long. Max Cavalera made a career out of it with Soulfly. I honestly don't get his appeal and why his shit bands get more recognition than Sepultura. But with releases like 'Against', 'Nation' and 'Dante XXI' it wasn't like the material was clearly better than his.\n\nI don't get Max's appeal, he looks like he needs a shower in the worst possible way with that rat hair on his head, he could shave once every 2 weeks and he could lay off the donuts and beers too. Derrick Green is so much better of a vocalist and just as charismatic (if not more) on stage than Max ever was. At least Mr. Green looks like he just came from a track meet just before the show. He's energetic, enthusiastic, very charming and intelligent on stage. He is a winner of a choice for a replacement. But they just could not come up with a good album, I'm not expecting a great release. I have modest standards for them. I blame that solely on Andreas Kisser. He's the creative mind and main decision maker of the band. He's got the talent, no doubt. We've seen it on display at shows and on their best albums. But it never translated on their recent or \"post Max\" catalog. As you hear the Soulfly releases you know Sepultura wouldn't have been much better with Max had he stayed anyway. I'm just tired of that \"jumpdafuckup!\" teenage nu metal which evolved under the guise of groove metal today.\n\nSo I went to a recent show here in NYC and I was impressed. The band sounded real tight and energized. I said I would give them a chance with the new album. I got it and it was exciting to hear them sound good again. I hoped for this lineup to finally release an album that would shake the shadow of Max over them. 'Kairos' is that album. I see a few key things that changed the outcome. 1.) They signed to a new, well known label that had fully backed them up in Nuclear Blast and 2.) the addition of new drummer Jean Dolabella. He adds a freshness, new vitality. youthfulness that the band desperately needed. I saw him in their last show and he is better than Igor Cavalera. He was out of this world in concert. I understand he appeared on 'A-Lex' before, but that album already started a positive upward trend in Sepultura's sound and improvement overall. The band were heading in the right path from there and we get this album. \n\nFrom the moment we hear 'Spectrum' we get suspiciously optimistic. While this is the first legitimate \"thrash\" album they've done in 20 years there's still leftovers of groove and downtuning here and there. It's the modern guitar sound to be honest. I doubt it's really going to go away anytime soon. 'Relentless' is an instant hit on their hands if they release it as a single. The cover of Ministry's 'Just One Fix' is actually pretty good. It doesn't sound out of place here. 'Dialog' is a good track, keeps the flow going. Not anything special. 'Mask' however is much better and I love it. It's as thrash as the band can get nowadays and I hope they make an entire album off this sound next time. 'Seethe' continues the trash elements and once again is a memorable track. 'Born Strong' keeps the speed up and at this point I can confirm this album's superiority over anything else in the last 15 years for this band. I can't remember the last time I heard a string of good songs in a row on a post Max album, if ever. \n\nThe run from 'Mask' all the way to the 'No One Will Stand' is what makes this album more than merely good. The closer 'Structure (Azzes)' is different sounding from the previous 5-6 tracks with a tribal rhythm in it. The three instrumental tracks here add almost nothing to the album outside of 30 seconds of relief from the joy you get from knowing that this band got it right. I can't believe how long it took for Andreas Kisser to get the message that we need the thrash back. The tunes and the most importantly the riffs are back again. Derrick Green always delivers, Jean Dolabella brings back some intensity to the band and it was about time Andreas Kisser matched them. What about Paulo Jr.? I suppose he keeps the ship afloat, the stability they need. That's all I can add there.\n\nWhat Sepultura lost when Max left was a face, a mascot. The human representation of the band outside of the logo and album covers. The magazine cover man, the one where people look in the stands for. People who didn't know any better thought Max was Sepultura and a lot of You Tube and Metal Archives trolls still think that. Probably because they're too lazy to care, or being trolls to annoy the still present fanbase out there. These guys were too talented to quit because Max left. They were a band before and even more so today. There's a sense of team spirit, unification against the masses. Against the people who didn't think they were still capable of what they knew deep down inside. And that's to be a great band again.\n",
        "\nIt's hard to even properly interpret Sepultura's earliest works considering the direction they went later. Everyone's firmly aware that Sepultura began as a raw, unformed, primitive death/thrash band before evolving into one of the more seminal and technically accomplished bands of thrash's golden age, but making albums like this one cognitively jive with releases like 'Arise' is still challenging. A lot of people forget that at the beginning of Sepultura's career, they were knee-deep in the brackish Cogumelo sound of related bands like Sarc\u00f3fago (which Wagner Antichrist would later establish after his brief term with Sepultura was up) or Holocausto, not the refined sound of American thrash that they would later come to more or less emulate. It's because of this that opinions on 'Morbid Visions' tend to miss the mark in my opinion; a great number of people put an excessive emphasis on the relative brutality or extremity of this album and the rest of Sepultura's pre-'Beneath the Remains' output and not enough on the pure songwriting involved. Is 'Morbid Visions' the most extreme work of Sepultura? Probably- but it's also a rather confused, very unrefined album that is more significantly dated than many similar records from the same period.\n\nThe most immediate sonic comparison is, rather unsurprisingly, Possessed, filtered through the more barbaric and primitive lens of early Teutonic thrash like Sodom or Kreator. A release date in late '86 gave the Brazilians plenty of time to spin 'Endless Pain' and 'In the Sign of Evil' in anticipation of their first full-length, and it shows: the ranting, too-fast vocal performance, tension-laced tremolo riffing, and sloppy, juvenile instrumentation are all directly derived from the German camp. From Possessed, though, comes a more immediately dark and twisted feeling, the hellish and fiery sound of which was clearly a conscious takeaway from 'Seven Churches.' Even though this is Sepultura's most brutal and crude release, it's still not quite as antagonistic and self-involved as 'I.N.R.I.' or 'Campo de Exterm\u00ednio'- this album is the sound of kids who really look up to Slayer but are basically unable to achieve that level of instrumental prowess at their age. Hints of the sheer brutality of the Cogumelo scene will pop up in fits and starts in the form of sloppy, uneven blasts and even more malevolent than usual riffing, both of which dot tracks like 'Mayhem' with little ceremony or sense.\n\nThe playing is uneven and crude and the production is the same, but what I think prevents this album from really entering classic territory is the songwriting itself. As previously stated, this is clearly the sound of Sepultura trying to emulate several contrasting, combative styles of thrash at once, but the combination of all these different influences doesn't end up displaying hybrid vigor so much as a diluted sense of self. The riffcraft tends to be rather generic and over-simplified, with too heavy a reliance on typical thrash riff structures, a lack of rhythmic variation, and a lack of variation from track to track. Oddly enough, many of the musical ideas here are present on later albums- 'War' is like a prototype of the title cut off 'Arise'- but refined and streamlined, which really seems to be what Sepultura was originally made for. Even at a young age, Sepultura weren't quite the drunken sociopaths that many of their Cogumelo brethren were, and even on 'Morbid Visions' you can tell that they aspire to more mainstream and traditional ideas of quality.\n\nAll that being said, 'Morbid Visions' certainly occupies a crucial spot in early extreme metal history simply by virtue of its sheer influence. In one fell swoop, 'Morbid Visions' essentially codified the style of Brazilian thrash (even if it wasn't really a sterling example of it) and set up the beginning of Sepultura's legacy. While this is certainly not their greatest work, it's an invaluable look at the early Brazilian scene and the first real volley from one of thrash's pioneering bands.\n\nIf you have anything after the initial pressing of this album, you have the 'Bestial Devastation' tracks from Sepultura's split with Overdose tacked on as a bonus- considering the impossibility of finding an original copy of 'Morbid Visions' (or even a copy of the isolated 'Bestial Devastation') it only seems fair to discuss that as well. Even more overtly Teutonic than 'Morbid Visions' and somewhat less preoccupied with the burgeoning death metal sound 'Morbid Visions' clearly attempts to emulate, these short, violent tracks could easily be b-sides from 'Endless Pain', with an almost identical vocal delivery and chaotic, jerking drum performance. The aggressively '80s production (replete with vocal echo and half-distorted guitar) has a charm to it that 'Morbid Visions'' hazy cavern tends to lack, and the songwriting seems more genuine, enthusiastic, and less self-aware than the material off the band's first full-length. I personally prefer these tracks to anything off 'Morbid Visions,' but since getting them together is something of an inevitability, it all comes down to a matter of taste. I will say, though, that the Wagner-penned 'Antichrist' is probably my favorite track on the entire disc, mostly because it absolutely sounds like a forgotten Sarc\u00f3fago track, with its ludicrous, clumsy blasting and adolescent joy.\n\nRegardless of my particular feelings on this album, it's rather inevitable that I'm forced to recommend it to anyone interested in early metal. Enthusiasts for oldschool, primitive death/thrash will likely find a lot to love here, but more important than that is the historical relevance of these tracks. It rarely gets more authentic or archaic than this in extreme metal, and anyone who wants to hear the very earliest fires of death metal burn will need to pick this up as a matter of course. Even if you don't like it in particular, it inevitably occupies a valuable space in anyone's collection.\n\n(Originally written for http://www.trialbyordeal666.blogspot.com)\n",
        "\nSepultura, while certainly not the best band from Brazil, was truly worthy of their mass attention following the release of their 1989 Magnus-opus Beneath the Remains. Unlike many thrash metal bands, proclaimed by the mainstream media to be among the best in the genre when they really weren\u2019t (especially the mass hype surrounding heavily influencail Metallica), Sepultura actually lived up to the hype sporting genuine talent and technique, to create several masterpieces of extreme, yet controlled and somewhat sophisticated Death/Thrash metal. \n\nStarting with the primitive, but enjoyable and thrilling Bestial Devastation ep, and their first album, Morbid Visions, Sepultura started to mature as a band, and the antics of pure speed alone started to cease, resulting in the more refined sophomore album. At this point, it was clear that the band wished to expand upon their sound, and incorporate more thrash influences into their mostly death metal sound. The fact that they were largely influenced by Metallica\u2019s is most obvious when listening to the Metallica inspired instrumental Inquisition Symphony, as well as the more variation in their music, and more varied song structures compared to earlier efforts. Without a doubt Schizophrenia was transitional, and exposed Sepultura\u2019s venturing into a more Bay-Area patterned format, while still preserving some of their death metal tendencies.\n\nBy the time their third album, Beneath The Remains saw the light of day, Sepultura had evolved even more since Schizophrenia, and became even more mature as a band, focusing on catchy and memorable riffs, and incorporating Metallica-like structure to their album layout (take for instance the clean instrumental preceding the first song, being much more straight forward than the other songs on the album. similar to Metallica circa 1984-88). Still the band showed no signs of slowing down, and although the somewhat undesirable (or at least in my opinion) Metallica influences became more obvious, they still managed to be surprisingly aggressive, and straight forward with their music, Exceeding the speed of both Slayer and Dark Angel. \n\nThe production of this album alone in a clear improvement over previous works, sounding sufficiently heavy and surprisingly clear, for a band that still had relatively little studio experience, largely due to a better producer. The clarity even matches that of more popular American bands, only aiding the intensity of the music even further. The main problem with Schizophrenia was the production was still very weak, and did not adequately support the stellar music on the album. BTR had a professional amount of clarity, that give little to complain about. \n\nIn terms of song structure, BTR continues, and in some aspects (but not all) expands upon what Schizophrenia started, continuing the more mature and controlled, yet fast and intense approach, only done in a more streamlined way than before. Whereas Schizophrenia was much more raw, wild and in many ways more ambitions, BTR seems to be more focused on Restrained riffs, less adventures than before, focusing more on heaviness. To me, this is the only shortcomings of the album, the simplicity of the riffs.\n\nSchizophrenia was actually semi-technical in nature, with complexity stemming from a multitude of techniques, and constant tempo changes in each song. The riffs on BTR sound a bit tired, and more chord based, with some moments of tremolo picking, but not quite as much as on the Schizophrenia album. Take for instance the song Inner-Self, with chugging riffs similar to that of Metallica, as a pose to the rampant death thrashing number R.I.P. (Rest in Pain). The riffs just don't seem as wild as before, but still are satisfying in that they are controlled, and memorable. The true strength of BTR however, lies in the drumming.\n\nBeneath the Remains boasts some of the fastest and most intense drumming since their '85-'86 period, easily exceeding, Slayer, and Dark Angel at the time. The Drums are also a huge improvement over Schizophrenia, being much faster, but much more clear and refined as well. While Sepultura were not the fastest of the time, with bands like Sadus, Necrodeath, and Merciless far exceeding them in the area of speed, they were sufficiently fast, and did not go overboard with speed. Just like Slayer on RIB, they were aiming for writing something that was not just mindless bashing, but controlled while still being intense and straight-forward, unlike Metallica\u2019s overly restrained, semi-thrash, that actually had more traits of NWOBMH and traditional heavy metal than it did thrash. Sepultura basically took the formula of Slayer, and applied Metallica elements, with touches of death metal, and much more speed. \n\nTo me, BTR remains the best \"popular\" thrash metal album, but not the best in the genre. While being more mainstream in its production, and more controlled, it is still savage and extreme compared to other bands that crossed over into the mainstream. Additionally, the quality of the album is undeniable. While master of puppets hardly lived up to it supposed title of best thrash metal album (Just to clarify things I'm not saying it's a bad album, I just don't find it to be the best in the genre), BTR actually is a quality album that lives up to its hype. Sure, Sepultura is somewhat overrated, and this album certainly is, but this is one of the cases when the people are right. Sepultura is one of those few bands that actually deserve to be, as they have real talent and quality music (at least from 85-91). BTR is highly recommended for those who want fast, yet controlled thrash, that has a professional level of musicianship. The bands best without a doubt.\n",
        "\nThe popular opinion among extreme metal fans is that with the release of \"Chaos A.D.\", Sepultura were hopping on the musical bandwagon for heavy metal in the '90s, abandoning their magnificent and decidedly non-trendy speed metal riffing in favor of a more commercially acceptable groove oriented style, made quite popular by bands like Pantera. The majority seem to speculate that the boys from Brazil changed their style so they could keep selling albums in the new musical climate, and that their output suffered because of it. I don't agree with that. \n\nWhile the stylistic change may have come during a time when slower, groovier music was becoming popular in the metal scene, in no way is this album toned down as far as extremity. \"Chaos A.D.\" contains by far the heaviest and arguably the most aggressive material Sepultura had yet written. What Sepultura choose to hold back as far as musical complexity, they make up for with sheer ferocity. The simpler guitar riffs bludgeon the listener in the same way Celtic Frost did a decade before and the slower beats allow some space and breathing room; they have time to build strength before crashing down. In a way I would compare the music on this album to classic Discharge or Cro-Mags. An odd comparison perhaps but the approach is similar: aggressive, yet simple, repetitive guitar riffs over steady, pummeling beats with angry, gruff, screaming vocals and minimalist, politically charged lyrics - total fucking hardcore.\n\nWhile \"Morbid Visions\", \"Schizophrenia\", \"Beneath the Remains\" and \"Arise\", were all unique and highly influential albums, ultimately putting Brazil on the map for extreme metal, they were still of a style that was mostly rooted in the music pioneered by bands from the United States, England and Europe. I believe that Sepultura added the groove element to their sound, not to make their music more accessible, but because the rhythmic, tribal element was better representative of where they were from. It gave the band a sound and style they could really call their own, and at the same time pulled them out of the stagnant overgrown swamp that was the death/thrash metal scene at the time. Many die hard, \"old-school\" headbangers cry about this album being one of those that helped jump-start the whole \"nu-metal\" movement, and they're probably right, but \"Chaos A.D.\" is far more abrasive than the melodic, pop-garbage that MTV, mainstream \"hard rock\" radio, and glossy magazines like Hit Parader were trying to pawn off as \"heavy\" music to angsty mallrats.\n\nI once held the opinion that \"Arise\" was the last 'good' Sepultura album. It was only after discovering the aforementioned Celtic Frost and Discharge and masochistically loving every moment having my skull battered by them, that I've been able to draw the comparisons between \"Chaos A.D.\" and the classic works of those two bands and it changed my opinion. I hope this review can change some others' opinions that they might come to enjoy this classic album as well.\n",
        "\nSepultura's fifth full-length is unique in terms of weirdness: \"What does Chaos A.D. sound like?\" is a rhetorical question even for those who are very familiar with the album. The amount of genres mixed into it is bizarre, and each song is so different from the other that if it were not for Max Cavalera\u2019s vocals it would sound like a groove metal compilation. The situation is aggravated by its unique ability to generate commotion and polemics, and someone who has not heard the album before will still be unable to tell how it sounds like no matter how many reviews he/she reads. By writing this review, I will try to clarify things a bit, and succeed where others have failed. Do I sound preposterous? Surely I do. This is a doomed task, but as far as I know, trying does not hurt.\n\nFirst, I don\u2019t consider Beneath the Remains to be the masterpiece it is supposed to be. Surely enough it is creative, and it does have many interesting riffs, but Sepultura was little more than Slayer with lower vocals back then. Chaos A.D. was, if not their magnum opus, the first full-length that was truly theirs. Within the album, you will find some of the catchiest riffs ever, and the desire to mosh is present in every song but the bonus tracks. The drums \u2013 that mix Brazilian influences with groove metal ones \u2013 are undeniably creative and Cavalera\u2019s pissed off vocals are amusing enough to keep you going. \n\nThe album has two main strengths. The first of them is the drumming - an extremely competent and creative Igor Cavalera pretty much carries the album for half of its length, and the mosh-friendly aspects of the full-length are empowered with a series of influences from Brazilian genres that at first do not have anything to do with metal. The drum patterns are so varied that one would guess that the band hired several different drummers instead of sticking to Igor. The second is Refuse/Resist, a track that might be not only the best Sepultura has ever written, but also one of the best songs in terms of mosh that human beings were able to come up with, despite its slow nature and simplicity. Everything in that song \u2013 with the possible exception of the lyrics \u2013 gets emotional response from the audience when played live, and I have yet to see a cover of this song being played without individuals thrusting each other.\n\nHowever, once you start to think about the album as a whole you realize that it does not have a lot to offer: as I mentioned before, this album offers a different formula, one that was coined by Sepultura itself and that is based on immediate gratification rather than on technicality or skilled songwriting. It is a real mosh gem, but when listening to it alone for more than twenty minutes you realize that the recording is as superficial as it gets: the lyrics vary from weak to dumb and some songs are repetitive to the point of being annoying. Superficiality, however, does not explain the horde of outraged Sepultura fans that spit in the face of this album. What turned fans off was the fact that with Chaos A.D. Sepultura left the world of thrash completely, choosing to replace their Slayer heritage with hardcore-influenced groove riffs that laugh in the face of speed and are as complex as a hydrogen atom. It is true that those riffs did not exactly suck, but to give their fans something that was purely based on creativity and that could not be compared musically to anything they had previously recorded was the same thing as asking for bad reception.\n\nOf course, when such a thing happens it is interesting not to have terrible tracks. \u201cBiotech is Godzilla\u201d, \u201cWe Who Are Not as Others\u201d are two lame songs, being the first one extremely short and predictable (the same drum pattern for two minutes\u2026 ugh) and the other an instrumental track that simply doesn\u2019t go anywhere and has a single sentence that barely manages to be an excuse for not being able to come up with lyrics at all. Those two songs wouldn\u2019t make it to a list of the worst songs ever, but they make a statement about everything that is wrong with this album: when creativity falls short, the lack of depth makes itself clear and the listener is left with absolutely nothing but a lot of annoying filler passages.\n\nSummarizing, this is not as good or as bad as it is supposed to be, it is simply a somewhat radio-friendly album with tracks that differ from each other not only in terms of riffs but also in terms of influences. The album does have flaws, which become visible when creativity falls short, but listening to it is an ultimately amusing experience as long as you do not try to sit through the whole album at once. I would give it a score of 70, but seriously, Refuse/Resist and the drum pattern that opens territory easily earns 10 extra points.\n",
        "\nFirst of all lets get a few things straight.\n\nSepultura DID NOT record this album in the Amazon! In fact the Amazon had very little influence on this album. So seriously, when people talk of all this \"Amazon\" stuff, they clearly don't know what they are talking about. The album was mostly recorded in the eastern part of the state of Mato Grosso which may not mean a lot to most people outside of Brazil but trust me, it's not the Amazon.\n\nNext, This is not thrash. It goes without saying right? No one is disputing this but apparently this causes a lot of distress for Sepultura fans who only like the \"real\" Sepultura i.e. pre Chaos era. OK so after \"Arise\" they could've taken one of two roads. One, continue down the thrash road and end up like AC/DC or Slayer in that they never change their sound. Or two, do what they did and venture in a different direction. So there lies the argument between fans and no one will ever agree. Personally, I'm glad they changed. Sure I love AC/DC and Slayer but their lack of direction makes me a bit bored sometimes and I find myself only listening to their older stuff anyway. A change in direction can be the best, worst or most indifferent thing that can happen to a band. In Sepultura's case I think it was the best. So when people say \"well it doesn't compare to Arise\". Of course it doesn't, they are completely different. They changed, get over it.\n\nSo lets talk about the album itself.\n\"Roots Bloody Roots\" kicks in and straight away there is a different vibe. It's slower, heavier and deeper than all Sepultura's material that preceeded it. Still a live staple today, \"Roots Bloody Roots\" is certianly a killer track and I guess one of those songs that is a lot more accessible to the mainstream.\n\n\"Attitude\" follows it up, begining with the unmistakable sound of the Berimbau. A uniquely Brazilian one stringed instrument that compliments Sepultura's sound perfectly and is the perfect introduction to one of the heaviest tracks on the album.\n\nWhen it comes to change of sound, the examples dont get more fitting than \"Ratamahatta\". With the Brazilian beats and assistance from the Xavante tribe, Sepultura create a track that certainly doesn't have an equal anywhere outside this album. One could almost argue that this is the archetypal \"Roots\" song. Metal guitar heavily interlaced with Brazilian influences and lyrics in Portuguese.\n\nLater sees the least metal part of the album in the form of \"Jasco\" and \"Its\u00e1ri\". \"Jasco\" is a lone little guitar piece that shouldn't be a surprise to Sepultura fans as they'd already dabbled with this type of track with \"The Abyss\". Yet this one is much different in that the scale Andreas uses is much more different and exotic than most used to hearing. It's a fantastic little ditty that, for guitarists, is a great joy to master and play. \"Its\u00e1ri\" is a pleasant track that is mainly light acoustic guitar with chanting and other contributions again from the Xavante tribe.\n\nThe album finishes (unless of course you have the Digipak version) with perhaps their most intense moment in \"Dictatorshit\". Heavily distorted and lightning fast, it's probably the only track that would satisfy the fans of \"real\" Sepultura.\n\nThe guitars are tuned low and are heavily distorted. Igor's drumming is at it's best and while replacing the sometimes monotonous thrash drumming style with a more groove orientated sound, it's no less impressive. OK so the lyrics are, well, not the most poetic or sophisticated but that's Max and in my opinion his passion when singing them makes up for the lack of sophistication.\n\nAbove all else, though, what makes this album so amazing is that it really is the most Brazilian any Brazilian band has sounded. Heavy metal is not a Brazilian invention but of course metal is for everyone worldwide and like the world itself, it is varied and unique depending on where it comes from, or at least it should be. America had the bay area thrash, Britain had NWOBHM, Sweden has Gothenburg metal but what about Brazil? Sure Brazil isn't exactly the most influential country when it comes to metal. Brazilian bands such as Angra, Korzus, Sarc\u00f3fago, Torture Squad and Eminence are all playing heavy music but if you just listened to the music and you didn't know, it could think it was from anywhere. I consider myself lucky to be living in Brazil and while most Brazilians will sit there and tell you about the horrible aspects of their country such as violence, poverty and corruption, in the same breath they'll tell you they wouldn't live anywhere else. They have a right to be proud of their country and its amazing and varied culture. However, when it comes to metal, that culture never comes out in the music and personally I think it's a shame. When you listen to \"Roots\", there is little doubt where this album originates from. Some may call it a cheap attempt to cash in on some exotic sound but I strongly disagree. I think Sepultura was the only band to have the balls to heavily lace their music with sounds and language of their native country and I think bands should do it more often. Why do we expect bands from different places to all sound the same? Why do we expect them to all sing in English? There are so many fascinating sounds from so many different cultures around the world and many of those would fit into metal so well, for me it's a shame it isn't exploited more often. \n\nSo love it or hate it, I still maintain that while it certainly isn't the fastest or thrashiest of Sepultura's albums, it's the most interesting, dynamic, coolest sounding and in my opinion, their best.\n",
        "\nFew albums have polarized the masses quite like Chaos A.D., but I really have to admit, after careful consideration: this is my favorite release from the Brazilians. Why, you ask, would a thrash purist like myself prefer this over their faster, busier albums like Beneath the Remains? Well, for one, I found Arise quite a bore. There were a few good tracks hidden in it, but the tone of the album did absolutely nothing for me, and I thought it was a few steps backward from Beneath the Remains. More importantly, Chaos A.D. is a culmination of form. It was inevitable, really. Take the band's social and political lyrical stance, the tribal folk influence of their environment, and the down tuning hardcore breakdowns; combine these to create one of the most fist pumping pit epics ever.\n\nI'll go one further: Chaos A.D. is probably the most mosh-worthy album in the history of metal. Almost every track here is laden with brutal yet simple pit grooves that are nearly irresistible, even to one such as myself, who has loathed the mosh pit culture since a very young age. Sepultura writes these things extremely well here. Max's angry barking and one of the best productions I've ever heard for a metal album round out the pummeling, furious statement that is Chaos A.D. Make no mistakes about it, this is one pissed off album.\n\n\"Refuse/Resist\" begins the album with a powerful groove and some nice drumwork, before the infamous line Chaos A.D.! Tanks On The Streets! Confronting Police! Bleeding The Plebs! delivered just as angrily as any hardcore band. The tribal \"Territory\" thrives of its simplistic grooves and crazy breakdowns. \"Slave New World\" is a thrasher that might have also appeared on either of the previous two albums. \"Amen\" has the perfect, simple verse riff, dispersed by some slower drum fills and doomier guitar breaks. \"Kaiowas\" is a folk, acoustic piece, yet it feels as if it fits here completely. \"Propaganda\" starts with haunting, ringing guitars before pulverizing your face yet again with a simple riff which seems like it's just a variation of others on the album. But this is the forte of Chaos A.D., it's basically feeding you the same style of riffs over and over and having you love them every time, the power of cohesion and continuity reigns. \"Biotech is Godzilla\" is a decent, faster track but not one of my favorites on the album. \"Nomad\" begins with another ringing mid-ranged guitar, almost siren-like, before the drum fill leads into another neck breaking groove. \"We Who Are Not As Others\" is a progressive track with some acoustic fills, bluesy wails and gang shouts. Very effective. \"Manifest\" is a brutal tribute to the violence of prison population purges. The band covers \"The Hunt\" from New Model Army, and does an excellent job with the tune, sounding very much their own. \"Clenched Fist\" ends the album with another sick, grooving verse.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this album has an insanely good mix, recorded in England. Everything is loud and clear, the guitars sound punishing and the vocals pissed. The tribal fill inflections of the percussion are evident, and the bass runs thick. Crank this fuck and just try not banging your head to it. The lyrics are decent and meaningful, especially for the band. I have heard countless horse shit scenester complaints about how this album is 'sellout' and one of the influences that created the dreaded 'nu metal' genre, along with Machine Head and the emerging rapcore scene. But here is the catch: who cares? If all nu metal had been as good as this album, noone would have hated it to begin with. Unfortunately that was not to be, and even Sepultura started rolling downhill after this (I may not agree with the blowhards that this record was the Anti-antichrist, but I certainly agree about Roots).\n\nBefore this arrived, I had lauded Beneath the Remains as my favorite album from the band. While that remains the best of their speed/thrash style, Chaos A.D. is the album that truly defines this band for me. It's where they stopped being Slayer, D.R.I. and Metallica's heavily accented counterpart from Brazil and became an entity all to themselves, yet still has plenty of those types of thrash riffs. It is distinctive and nigh flawless. It still sounds great today. Give it a chance, or give it another.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nGrowing up there were few bands I worshipped more than Sepultura. Naturally that sentiment revolves completely around their first four albums, which I had discovered backwards from my introduction to the band, the bland \"Chaos A.D.\" After adding \"Beneath the Remains\" to my collection, I seriously thought things couldn't get any better. Then I discovered \"Schizophrenia,\" the band's second proper release and a highly noticable upgrade over the visceral yet immature \"Morbid Visions.\"\n\nI don't usually get ahead of myself when reviewing certain albums or bands, but Sepultura is one of those exceptions. I realize there are some bands who might have done things better than Sepultura (like another Brazilian band I keep hearing about called Torture Squad) but I have yet to hear them. In my opinion, which is sometimes considering blasphemy by metal's inner circles, but this album beats out \"Reign In Blood\" in terms of memorability and sheer aggression.\n\nSome of the key ingredients to this new and improved band would be the upgraded performances of all of the musicians and songwriting process. The sound quality still isn't perfect, it persists with a raw flavor that keeps some of the more polished fans away from this kind of thrash metal. Yet as Igor Cavalera shakes your house off its foundation, Andreas Kisser and Max Cavalera conjure up a whirlwind of riffs that bitch slaps you merciessly into oblivion. Yes, this is exactly what you want out of a thrash metal album, and some of these songs are also memorable and pretty easy to recall, which only works to the band's advantage. As an added bonus, Cavalera's \nproto-death vocals on this album are powerful, even more so than the slightly toned down version of it that we would hear on \"Beneath the Remains.\"\n\nOne example of a destructive forces conjured up by thrash is \"From the Past Comes the Storm.\" This song forced the American thrashers of the 80's to pay attention to this band, and destroys almost anything that came out around this time period with its buzzsaw riffs. It remains one of my favorite Sepultura songs, and for good reason. Not all are equally powerful, though none of these are anything close to bad. Some stand-outs would also include the grooving \"To the Wall,\" the aggressive \"Escape to the Void\" and the remake of the Sepultura classic, \"Troops of Doom.\" You are even treated to a long yet sufficient instrumental in \"Inquisition Symphony,\" which has been covered by some but never will they emulate the greatness of the original. You also get a short acoustic interlude in \"The Abyss,\" which is basically the calm before the storm in the closer \"Rest In Pain.\"\n\nBottom line, you need this album. It is actually better in some ways than \"Beneath the Remains,\" with the exception of sound quality. I personally like Cavalera's vocal performance here the best of all he's done, perfectly blending thrash and death vocal styles into one. The lyrics aren't all that great, given that the band was still learning to speak English and not incredible lyric writers at the time. Regardless, this is an essential album for thrash fans and one of the very best Sepultura have ever put out. Every time you're forced to endure more of the drivel the modern incarnation of this band puts out, reach for \"Schizophrenia\" and send that hardcore crap back to the dump.\n",
        "\nContrary to popular belief, the majority of thrash bands in the 1990's did not fall into mediocrity immediately. There was always a \"gateway\" album, an album that was decent enough yet showed troubling signs of some degree which foreshadowed the musical horrors that would follow. The most obvious one of these was Metallica's self-titled album, which was lackluster but solid despite the change of sound. MegaDeth had this in \"Countdown to Extinction\" and \"Youthanasia,\" both of which were very good for what they were. Slayer had \"Divine Intervention,\" and our Brazilian friends in Sepultura had \"Chaos A.D.\" It was by far not the worst thing they would do in their career, but it was a definite step backwards from the thrash excellence of previous material.\n\nWhen I first began buying music CD's many years ago I got into Sepultura based on a recommendation from a friend. This was the only album available at the time (which makes sense, its their most famous and the only one retailers seem to have most of the time) so I picked it up. At that particular point in time, I immensely enjoyed what I heard and assumed the band's best moments were cemented around what I heard here. Naturally, after getting the band's back catalog, particularly \"Beneath the Remains\" a couple of years later, my opinions were completely changed. Suddenly, \"Chaos A.D.\" was no longer the shining star I had mistaken it for previously. In fact, I dare say \"Chaos A.D.\" was the gateway to disaster for this band, an opinion a good number of folks here on the Archives seem to agree with.\n\nSo where does this album go wrong? For one, the weight shift of modernity in the early 1990's was not a pretty one by any stretch of the imagination. Though some bands like Overkill countered this some degree of intelligence and retention of quality, most others, including Sepultura, did not. What \"Chaos A.D.\" offers more than anything is a dumbing down of their incredible thrash legacy set in the four albums before this one. Considering the legacy includes albums like \"Schizophrenia\" and \"Beneath the Remains,\" which were both ass-kicking whirlwinds of massive riffs, its hard to understand why \"Chaos A.D.\" was ever concieved. Maybe it was the appeal of commericialism that struck the band like a virus, or maybe it was the desire to expand sounds and prevent musical stagnation. If it was the former, shame on the band and if it is the latter, they did a terrible job of expanding anything other than boring groove metal.\n\nContrary to most of the negative reviews here, I actually liked the song \"Refuse / Resist.\" Yes, it is massively overrated, often considered by the media to be the band's best song. I can firmly say, after stacking it up against \"From the Past Comes the Storm,\" \"Beneath the Remains,\" among others, that it is not, nor is it close to being the band's best. Still, its kept to an ideal length for groove metal, to the point I can't truly complain. \"Territory\" is a different matter, as it becomes too stagnated and long winded for its own good. Other tracks like \"Amen\" and \"Nomad\" are both similiar stories, with the former going into some poorly placed religious chants, foreshadowing the ill-fitted avant-garde ideas that would consume \"Roots\" like a boa constrictor does its prey. This also plays into \"Kaiowas,\" which I will admit was a decent enough idea considering it was fairly new at the time just not carried out very well. Again, more nods to the abominable mess heard on \"Roots.\"\n\nYet not all is lost in the world of half-assed Brazilian groove metal. \"Propaganda\" hammers out some decent moments when it gets going, though still nothing compared to albums of years past. \"Biotech is Godzilla\" is silly as hell but a competent hardcore inspired song. I like the political message of the song, which Sepultura is usually known for, but the lyrics and Max's voice just do not work. Neither sounds like they were given much effort, and since Jello Biafra was involved in some sectors of this album, that explains the hit and miss nature of the lyrics all too well. At least Max doesn't end up singing the ultra-happy nonsense the Dead Kennedys often got into. Evan Sienfeld's name is also attached to the credits, though he appears as a musician only on \"Slave New World.\" Nothing to get excited about there anyway, you can't really tell its him aside from the credits and I'm not someone who gets overly happy to see anyone from Biohazard appear on a record.\n\nAs much as I'd like to stomp this album flat at times, I really can't. It isn't as abominable as some might have you think, I come to this conclusion because I didn't judge this as a thrash album which it is not. Yet even based on groove metal standards, its a mostly pedestrian release with a few good songs surrounded by lame groove and bad ideas that only foreshadows what would transpire three years later on the tribal misfire of \"Roots.\" I can say that while it is an accessible album for the band, I wouldn't really want anyone to discover Sepultura this way. Discovering them with this album might lead one to think \"Roots\" and post-Cavalera Sepultura are acceptable, which is as far from the truth as possible and I'm lucky to have found their thrash albums and to know what acceptable Sepultura sounds like. If you're already an established fan of the group and wouldn't mind a trip into a world where Sepultura tried to be the Brazilian Pantera, then you might find something worthwhile here. If such a desire should occur, seek out \"Chaos A.D.\" from the discount aisle and leave it at that.\n",
        "\nI love listening to Morbid Visions for the physical tension that I hear in the playing. The album has no ambitions other than meeting its own demand for constant regimented violence. It\u2019s like a blank background for the tendon-ripping \u2018Marshall arts\u2019 performance ethic underlying all extreme metal, here presented without distractions as the absolute center of drama. Sepultura only have about three or four different moves at this point in their career, which they link together by reflex in songs that feel like endurance exercises. But they execute each routine with the heart that many listeners identified as the band\u2019s best attribute at their commercial peak. Whereas early material by influences like Sodom and Kreator has a decidedly gawky vibe due to instruments constantly falling out of time, the martial discipline of teenage Sepultura is well-documented by this record of their practice, an unwavering barrage of close-knit patterns of blows. Aided by a production that\u2019s cheap-but-clear with cool effects, Morbid Visions is a great example of how to write metal with the sustained application of force as the only principle.\n\nThe single-mindedness connecting Max\u2019s guitar and Igor\u2019s snare is the album\u2019s real currency. One gets the impression that the brothers have self-taught as a duo, developing complementary instrumental styles in tandem with a shared concept of the way thrash should be performed. To them, intensity lies in prioritizing control over constant aggressive strain: core strength. They structure individual riffs and entire musical sequences to contain pronounced synchronized rests on each instrument. This allows the players to get back in step with each other, as well as to conserve energy for their individual parts. It pays off in a huge yield of unusually well-matched speed picking and diabolic polka beat. Melodies are retarded most of the time, stunted little horrors dredged from the ugliest and most conservative parts of Hellhammer and Mantas. But something about the same-ness of it all, the fact that they constantly rearrange the same handful of \u2018wrong\u2019 notes, only adds to the impression of a band intently focused on their task. \n\nSo, this deeply shared musical language keeps all the band members focused on the conversation, but all they can do is keep repeating the same invocations of darkness, evil, and hatred. This suits me fine, and I\u2019m not especially interested in those things. Because whatever the music may superficially be \u2018about,\u2019 its real essence is the sheer pleasure of being able to concentrate body-and-soul on creating something excellent, that thing being brutal pitch-black speed metal. Hearing it, I always get the impression of running around madly, to and from the possibility of life\u2019s destruction, through a series of long black tunnels. In that sense the album is kind of like Satanic Blood by Von, especially with the reverb-ed vocals and overly loud drum fills, but with events and musical drama that prevent the metal from becoming trancelike and ritualistically decadent. In sum, Morbid Visions is just an enervating rush of youthful power desperate to perpetuate the terms of its own existence. Primitive thrash that makes you want to survive the impossible.\n",
        "\nI don't get all the hatred for this record. 'Refuse/Resist' stomps out the box with a roaring riff that makes me want to throw molotovs at tanks. 'Territory' is possibly the greatest song Sepultura has ever written. Igor's drum work is insane here. 'Slave New World' is ferocious, a neck-snapper balanced on layers of menacing groove. Sure, this isn't the straight death/thrash of old but it isn't the dumbed down monotony of 'Roots' either. This is a hybrid, an experimental push forward that proved the tipping point for a lot of other bands that followed. For Sepultura, incorporating elements of hardcore, punk, and Helmet style start/stop into the thrash equation reinvigorated their music but also provided an unduely fashionable influence that other bands watered down. Maybe that's why this record garners so much hate? Not so much for itself but for what it engendered? I don't know how anyone could care really in the face of such monster songs as 'Clenched Fist' and 'Propaganda.' Those songs blister. \n\nSure, there are some flaws here as 'The Hunt' is not a particularly good cover and doesn't fit the mood of the album at all. 'We Who Are Not Like Others' falters along simplistic lines once the gang shouts kick-in. As a mantra for the album, it works but the beautifully textured music beneath the vocals deserves more than this redundancy. Lastly, 'Manifest' would've been better served to sound less like an homage to Ministry -- a case of Sepultura letting their influences get the better of them. That said, these flaws are relatively minor in the overall scheme of the album.\n\nWhat strikes me most about \"Chaos A.D.\" is its vitriol, that an album this angry could remain this relevant is striking. Lyrically, it was this album that thrust Sepultura into the spotlight of political mass consciousness. Their anger was, well, manifest: anger over the mass suicide of the Kaiowas, who refused to be removed from their ancestral Amazonian lands; anger over U.S. biotech companies forcefully raping and pillaging traditional Brazilian organic agriculture, as well as the rainforest itself; anger over Israels treatment of Palestinians, anger over endemic global poverty and the economic inequalities of NAFTA. This was the album that brought me to a global, political perspective and showed me that metal (more than any other form of protest music, including punk) was capable of generating that palpable synergy of energy, awareness, anger, and despair. Even today, it's incendiary stuff.\n\nIt's too bad that Sepultura couldn't hang on to this sound. 'Arise' had taken their death/thrash sound as far as it could go. To continue in that vein seemed pointless. Yet 'Roots' fell too far over into simplicity and redundancy. \"Chaos A.D.\" gets it right and sixteen years later remains a vital testament to Sepultura's lasting power.\n",
        "\nIt goes without saying that what Sepultura has turned into over the years is not only disgraceful to the name of a once-was-great band, but really just metal in general. However, this is not a rant concerning the shit-eating nature of their post-\u2018Arise\u2019 material, but rather a review of my second favorite release from the band\u2019s \u201985-\u201989 golden era (my first being the \u2018Bestial Devastation\u2019 EP), as well as a way of hopefully justifying the album\u2019s downfalls. \n\n\u2018Morbid Visions\u2019 is one of those albums that has to be looked at in a contextual manner. Yes, it is sloppy. Yes, the production isn\u2019t quite up to par with people\u2019s need for digital perfection. Yes, the lyrics are retarded. All of these complaints are perfectly justifiable for those who just simply cannot handle raw recordings such as this one, and whose ears have been tainted by today\u2019s modern metal standards. However, for all of us who can in fact appreciate albums such as this one, in all of its sloppy, ugly glory, then \u2018Morbid Visions\u2019 really is a classic, and it will always be considered as such.\n\nOne of the main complaints this album seems to get is the production value. Well boo-fucking-hoo, you pussies. Personally, I would have preferred another \u2018Bestial Devastation\u2019-type production job, but this one still does not bother me at all. The vocals are perfectly audible, and have a dark, cavernous reverb effect on them. The guitar tones are rather thin and tinny sounding, sacrificing a bit of the heaviness this album could have achieved, but still do not deter from the malicious aura this album gives off, and as long as you can still hear the riffing perfectly, which you can, then you really can\u2019t complain. The bass, although not quite as upfront and kick-you-in-liver as it was on the preceding release, is still there, albeit a bit buried amongst the reverberated murkiness. The drums are also perfectly passable for an older black/death album, despite sounding rather distant and of course the sloppiness in which they are played with. Basically, if you can handle \u2018Bloody Vengeance\u2019, \u2018INRI\u2019, and \u2018Immortal Force\u2019, or pretty much all the other classic Brazilian recordings, you can without a doubt handle \u2018Morbid Visions\u2019. \n\nWhere as \u2018Bestial Devastation\u2019 had a much stronger thrash-oriented, proto-black/death sound, \u2018Morbid Visions\u2019, despite its primitiveness, is pretty much a pure black/death metal album, with little in the way of thrash influences. Max\u2019s vocals on here are a bit deeper then on the EP, but not my much. He also continues to use his brief, gruff growls, with the occasional drawn out last couple of words of a verse, which often is also given another layer with even more reverb on the original vocal track. This effect has been used by many, and each time its just as effective as the last. The riffing is still quite simplistic and hadn\u2019t quite reached the level of technicality, for lack of a better word, as on \u2018Schizophrenia\u2019. But I feel it\u2019s really for the better that the riffs on here are as simple as they are, as the band at this point obviously was not capable of impeccable, precise thrashing madness. They use lots of tremolo picking, almost in a black metal fashion, mixed with death metal-like palm-muted riffs and things of that nature. I think they could have been even more effective given the proper production job, but the way they were recorded actually gives off a rather eerie atmosphere. The drumming is the sloppiest part of the album, as well as the most simplistic, but he keeps up pretty consistently, and when he does lose his place, he seems to find it again a short while later. The fills and snare rolls are kind of all over the place, and the double-bass skills are pretty much non-existent, but this all adds to savage, bestial nature of the album.\n\nOnce you stop being a pussy get past the production and sloppiness, this is a pretty damn fine piece of early black/death metal done in the 80\u2019s Brazilian tradition that many of us have grown to love. I know it may be hard for some to believe that a band who sucks as much as everything released after \u2018Arise\u2019 did was actually good at one point, but I still recommend you forget about all of that and worship at the altar of this amazing piece of old-school history.\n",
        "\nI really wanted to like this album, really. Unlike a lot of people, I like post-Max Sepultura. With Dante, we had what seemed like the band was about to turn a new corner. Yet three years later A-Lex would hit the stores and instead of progression we get regression. With A-Lex we have 18 tracks, 4 of which are introductions and 14 are actual songs. The problem is the lack of creativity in the songs themselves.\n\nAt nearly 55 minutes the listener is overwhelmed by generic songs ranging from 2-3 minutes. Since Roorback, Sepultura has watered down their song structures to what sounds more like improvised jam sessions rather than actual songs. Since this is a concept album about A Clock Work Orange I was expecting something more theatrical and varied. Yet they failed to do so again.\n\nThe listener isn\u2019t given a chance to absorb most of the songs. There is little variation and lack of interesting beats. Yet A-Lex isn\u2019t completely useless. Filthy Rot, We Lost You, Sadistic Vales, and Ludwig Van are all interesting cuts. With Sadistic Values we have one of the longest songs since Arise, clocking in at nearly 7 minutes. This song features theatrical moments, a great build up which only complements the aggression of the song. Filthy Rot and We Lost You are your typical Sepultura classics, stuff you will rock out to with ease. Ludwig Van is an awesome instrumental which gives the album some much need variety.\n\nI really hope Sepultura decides to cut down the number of songs for their next album because it shouldn\u2019t be about quantity but rather quality. I\u2019m not one to praise the Max years but at least with those albums we had songs that contained tempo changes, long solos, and lots of variation within each song.\n\nThe reason why I\u2019m being so hard on this album is because I know the band can do better than this. Andreas is an exceptional guitar player who hasn\u2019t shown his true colours in awhile. Paulo has played some awesome bass melodies in the past but gets buried in the mix nowadays. Derrick is an extremely talented metal vocalist. Check out his performance on Nation to see his range...no Nation does not suck!! Jean doesn\u2019t really get a chance to establish himself on his debut. Judging from his performance he may have something to show us in the future, if Andreas decided to experiment more. \n\nDownload at best. Or if you\u2019re an extreme Sepultura fan, chances are you already have a copy. Good luck boys, hopefully this was a dud like Roots\u2026.fingers crossed.\n",
        "\nThis was one of my first experiences with Sepultura when I was in high school. At that time, I was unaware of Sepultura's origin as an extreme thrash metal band. The groove metal sound of the Roots/Chaos A.D. era was the sound I attributed to the band. At the time, this EP was amazing to me. It was powerful and aggressive and nothing like I had ever heard before. Sepultura was my gateway into extreme metal. The EP has almost everything: good songs from the recent album, some previously unreleased covers, and live tracks.\n\nNow, almost a decade since I had first gotten into Sepultura, this is still a decent release, although it has not aged well. The groove metal genre is watered down for the most part and only a select few bands have been able to be successful in that genre. Sepultura was one of those bands. Chaos A.D. and this EP are examples of groove metal done right.\n\nThe album kicks off with the heartbeat of \"Refuse/Resist\", possibly Sepultura's most well-known song. This is an extremely powerful song and has lost none of its power and meaning over the years. \"Propaganda\" is another strong track off of the Chaos A.D. album, and while not as good as \"Refuse/Resist\", is a fairly strong track as well. Max Cavalera's vocals have always been gruff but they really achieved a level of meanness and anger in the groove metal era of the band. The riffs are still strong as Max has always been able to write decent riffs and the drumming rumbles along with the rest of the band.\n\nThe cover tracks are hardcore/metal tracks that display the influences of the band. The band was raised on 80's hardcore and thrash and these influences have always shined through, especially early on. The best track here is probably \"Crucificados Pelo Sistema\". \n\nAfter that, the EP features some live tracks and this is where Sepultura always shines. Their live show is a major spectacle and the band plays very well. They are tight and cohesive and even more aggressive than their recorded material. The live tracks featured are mostly from their thrash days and helped introduce me to their earlier material. \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" is a true thrash classic. The album closes with the Motorhead cover \"Orgasmatron\" which Sepultura has really made their own. They play it frequently live and it sounds great.\n\nThis is a very good EP with all of the necessary ingredients to look for in an EP. A very good pickup and good place to start with the band.\n",
        "\nIt seems as if everything that can be said about this album has already been said. But then why should I write this review and would want anyone to read it? Because I feel like there are aspects of this album that have been barely discussed, if any at all. \n\nThis is a dangerous album to review, because it's a touchy subject among metal fans. With this album Sepultura hurt many old fans and delighted many others that cared less. But, in my personal view, here's other ways how this album is/was dangerous...\n\n#1: Musical fusion - brilliance or cheap exploitation of tribal music?\n\nI've heard many opinions about Sepultura and Roots, but no one has seemed to have questioned this before, because too many people are hung up on how \"nu-metal\" the album sounds. When I first heard about Roots, I immediately wondered if this is some stupid attempt to be exotic, where it was more about novelty than the substance. We've seen that happen many times in popular music. A prime example was when Paul Simon wrote \"Graceland\" and did some shows in Africa; I couldn't help but to feel that the album ultimately served as just another way for the \"intelligent\" white man to gain more glory and praise by using the music of \"tribal\" black men. \n\nThank god that's not exactly the case here. Max Cavalera and the band seems to be really in touch with the frustration that Xavante Indians possess. While the Xavantes are the political and social weaklings of Brazil, Sepultura was also an outcast of society in their early existence, being a bunch of scary metalheads. Sepultura also knows the difficulty of being the weak people in politics, since they are from a somewhat struggling third-world country (Brazil) that's been trying to gain more presence in international politics and economy. Sepultura approached the Indians for collaborations for the right reasons. It was the commonality they shared - social weakness, passion to refuse and resist oppression, and use of music as a weapon to guard their identity, that made this fusion of Xavante's music and sepultura's aggression work so well. By keeping lyrical content strictly to hymns of resistance that both camps relate to, Sepultura really justifies the musical experiment of the album. \n\n#2: Alternative/nu-metal sound - Is this the first time the band sold out?\n\nI think this just depends on your perspective. Obviously many people see the abandonment of technical guitar work as an act of sell-out. Lack of solos piss me off too - yes, you hear one brief solo on \"Endangered Species,\" but that's 14th track for fuck's sake - having one brief solo at the end of an album is really half-assed to me. \n\nBut wait a minute. Couldn't you call their transition from their early Morbid/Schizo sound to Beneath/Arise sound an act of \"selling out\" too? Sure, a shift away from satanist metal to thrash metal is a relatively small shift, but thrash was hot in the late 80s. It was marketable. It was the cool shit. Even Slayer stopped being blatantly satanic by the time Seasons in the Abyss came out in 1990. Isn't getting rid of Satanist metal for \"thrash\" in late 80s not that different as getting rid of thrash for newer, $$$ sound of alternative?\n\nIn Sepultura's defense though, Roots is clearly one of the best alternative/nu-metal albums. Period. No questions asked, and I'm not going to debate this with anyone. Even though Beneath and Arise weren't innovative, they were amazing albums good enough to be considered classic for the thrash genre. Likewise, Roots is an album that should be considered essential for nu-metal genre. But unlike Beneath/Arise, Roots was an genre-starting album rather than carrying the torch. And even though it's got a large element of nu-metal, remember folks, Sepultura did it with just 6 string guitars - no 7-string guitar Ibanez bullshit like everyone else. \n\n#3: \"Don't fuck with me\" vibe of the album - a true sense of danger or just childish rants?\n\nEarlier I mentioned lyrics being relevant to political and social resistance. We all know well that nu-metal generally has horrible lyrics and a lot of personal anger that lacks purpose and offers no closure or solution. Here, it sounds like aimless rants too, at first. However, on this album the primal expression of anger is carried out with a clear objective. Pick any lyrics, and you'll see that they're simplistic, rhymes here and there but not really, etc. These lyrics individually might not impress you, but when it's striking at a same issue so consistently from \"Roots Bloody Roots\" to \"Dictatorshit,\" it inevitably breeds a solid sense of purpose and inspiration to care about justice. \n\nAs far as vocals go, this is Max's best work ever. His screams on this album is a style all on its own. It's sincere and full of indignation, and Roots is more dependent on Max's vocal talent than anything else, even though the same could not be said of the band's previous albums. Particularly on \"Roots Bloody Roots\" does Max really shine - he is so intense on it that every single live performance I have seen pales to the recorded vocals.\n\nThe best part of it all is that the message of the album is political while being devoid of political ideals - it's easier to listen to Roots as music than the music of Rage Against the Machine or System of a Down where dogmatic politics can get really annoying. It's also aggressive only as much as it is necessary - like a desperate cry out of self-defense. The simple vocal delivery that taps mankind's primal instincts added to the thematic consistency, and ultimately made the album personal and political yet easy to digest and relate to without being excessive in violence. The lyrics and vocals on this album is probably why \"Sepultura=Max\" to many people, regardless of their opinion on Roots or even Chaos A.D. Max's vocals is really memorable.\n\nMy final verdict:\n\nRoots is inconsistent compared to albums up to Arise, or the recent masterpiece like A-Lex. Songs after the great instrumentals \"Jasco\" and \"Itsari\" just feels misplaced, because those two songs totally chills out the mood and kills the momentum (it's exacerbated by the middle-part of \"Ambush\" as well). That's too bad because the entire album up to that point is perfect - even \"Lookaway,\" which might come across as aimless to some, provoked an image of a dense Amazon jungle and maintained that dangerous feel. No songs on this album is a \"filler,\" but if Roots was meant to be a true battle cry of personal and political fury, then it should have left a couple tracks out or have tracklist arranged better. If I could've, I would've suggested to Sepultura to cut \"Itsari\" a little shorter too in order to not kill the momentum of the punk-like aggression. \n\nI am neither the type to think that this was an utter piece of shit, nor the type to praise this as \"Sepultura's best album ever,\" although I do lean towards the latter than the former. No matter how flawed it is and how frustrating it is at times, this album is a classic. Why? Because nothing sounded like this before or after. Not even Sepultura, Soulfly, or Cavalera Conspiracy could sound dangerous like that since. No wonder no one has played \"Ratamahatta\" and many other songs off Roots.\n",
        "\nHad I actually kept my attention focused for more than five minutes at a time, about two weeks ago this review would read far far differently from what has been submitted right now. For some inane reason, the memory of which I have managed to excessively dilute with beer, I seem to have this bizarre soft spot for post-'Roots' Sepultura and frequently give them the benefit of the doubt. While everyone else treated their albums as though they sonically transmitted leprosy, I always said they weren't completely awful and that they had the potential to write decent music, which they somewhat managed with 'Dante XXI'\n\nHowever something went wrong with 'A-Lex' and it's hard to explain because for the first couple of spins it's not bad; it's not great either but it manages to do little more than what you'd expect from modern Sepultura. With subsequent listens 'A-Lex' becomes more and more arduous to sit through as the few redeeming moments on the album all but disappear whilst the rest of the abhorrent material grinds away at your patience. Ignoring the superfluous, numbered self-titled tracks and \"Ludwig Van\" each other song fits into one of two categories with little to no divergence; short and fast or longer and mid-paced. The result is a very unbalanced album; the shorter tracks are more bearable since the riffs don't outstay their welcome, but they're also completely devoid of defining characteristics and are easily forgotten. The longer tracks are more distinctive but for all the wrong reasons; groove metal riffs are not uncommon to modern Sepultura and aren't the reason why these songs are so bad. It is more the fact that there are so few riffs per song that four minutes feels like eight minutes instead, which is further compounded by the all the songs sharing similar structures that they operate like clockwork. \"The Treatment\" is the only song which manages to switch things up enough to keep interest; still it's not a great track but it is at least some proof that Sepultura can write when they're really pushed to it.\n\nOf course if there's proof that Sepultura can fuck up the whole songwriting process then it's present in the form of the self-titled, concept story linked tracks which are a non-entity at best. They're highly reminiscent of similarly concept themed tracks that were present in 'Dante XXI'; you remember those right? Yeah, neither do I. They're uninteresting and don't drive the album forward, backward or any discernible direction. Sepultura should have just thrown what little subtlety they had out the window and have the band chant \"HEY GUYS THIS IS A CONCEPT ALBUM ABOUT 'A CLOCKWORK ORANGE'\" over and over for two minutes instead.\n\nFurther berating Sepultura and their atrocious attempts at songwriting we come across tracks such as \"Sadistic Values\" and \"Ludwig Van\". The former is just bizarre; the first half of the song is one of those quiet-y sections with some asinine notes picked out on the high E string while Derrick talks/whispers and such before we go into a groove riff and the song basically sounds like every other song until the end. While \"Sadistic Values\" is just an exercise in poorly gluing on a section to the front of a normal song so you can appear deep or thoughtful, \"Ludwig Van\" is a poor attempt at further establishing the concept story of the album albeit with no tact, subtlety or talent. Basically the band play alongside a piece of Beethoven's music, which piece I am not sure of so feel free to email me about how much of an uncultured heathen I am. At first thought you might assume this would be awful; some horrible bastardisation of classical music but really it's just boring because the band don't build upon the music, they're simply another set of instruments. I suppose it's good they didn't try to experiment with the track and do their own thing because they're fucking rubbish at doing anything outside the box or even inside the box most of the time.\n\n'A-Lex' is tedious. I really am confused that a band could write 'Dante XXI' which was interesting sometimes and then decide to fuck everything up by writing songs that are bland and severely lacking in dynamics. Whether we can put our hopes in Sepultura producing another good album is hard to say, but admittedly I'll still look forward to another album since at least they didn't write another 'Roots'.\n",
        "\nOr how about the riffs? Where are they?\n\nAfter the really, really good Arise, Sepultura took a turn for the worse with this effort. Sure, there were already hints of experimentation on Arise, but there the experimental stuff really enhanced Sepultura\u00b4s lethal thrash formula. And from here on out, it would only get worse, with the groovy Roots, and the downright boring Against. \n\nBasically, the album feels like a bunch of shit thrown at the wall, and seeing if any of it sticks. This isn\u00b4t nearly as bad as Against, which is chock full of filler and random shit, and there is a decent amount of consistency in the actual songs. Sadly, this involves rather boring riffs, and the songs themselves sound really rushed. Simpler is usually better, but on here, it really doesn\u00b4t work, especially when it is this hardcore focused stuff that really just kind of plods along. Yeah, you could say that there are some driving moments on here, like \"Refuse/Resist\" or \"Propaganda,\" as well as \"The Hunt,\" which they did not even write. \n\nIt all really just feels like they smoked a shit load of weed and got lazy. \"We Who Are Not As Others?\" Come on! At least put in some more lyrics! \"Kaiowas\" is just goofy as all hell, and might have made sense, had the album not contained so many damn songs. And the riffing...there is just no riffing going on, just silly hardcore chugging and chords. I just can\u00b4t even begin to place this alongside the first four albums. \n\nThe drumming here is very good and powerful, which works to the advantage of the album. In fact, the production is downright heavy. Sadly, the material is boring and disjointed at best. You can\u00b4t polish a turd, kids. And Andreas Kisser is really starting to slack in the lead guitar department on here...I\u00b4ve always likened him to Kirk Hammet, being that he\u00b4s technically very good, and does a few memorable leads, yet doesn\u00b4t fully push the envelope. On here, fuck, you don\u00b4t even get a memorable lead. \n\nNo wrath, no riffs, no Sepultura. I can see the mass appeal of this, the same as I see the appeal of Pantera\u00b4s Vulgar Display of Power (which is much better and more consistent), and sadly this is the real slip-up of Sepultura, before they took a massive fucking plummet over the next two albums, and never recovered. This was my first Sepultura album at the age of 13, and though it sounded really cool back then, I since found their past discography and grew out of this album at a rapid pace.\n",
        "\nRarities album, by their very definition, are never going to win any end-of-year polls, or rate in \"The top 100 albums of all time\" any time soon. If the songs were so good, wouldn't they have been released on an album proper, in the first place? These kind of albums are always a mixed bag, sometimes coming off as cheap cash-ins, laden with useless live tracks, and remixes which don't really need to be heard, such as Motorhead compilations. No matter how rare it is, it always seems to be just blatant cash-grabbing. However, there is the other type of compilation where care is taken in it's creation, with genuinely rare tracks, which are collated together for the sake of completeness, with no stone left unturned, and without polluting it with filler tracks from the archives, like Megadeth's Hidden Treasures, before they filled with tracks which are already readily available. These kind of albums are usually reserved for the Grindcore genre, with bands such as ANb and Nasum doing so in recent years, where the short song format lends itself to the inclusion of of loads of different releases in one set.\n\nProcreation (Of The Wicked) kicks things off with a bang, with it's sludgy riffing and raging vocals. It reminded me of Celtic Frost during the Monotheist tour, where they played all their songs slower and heavier than usual. Policia is also a great tune. Simplistic hardcore which blazes along. This is REAL hardcore metal, none of this haircut nonsense that persists today, fantastic, why couldn't they do more of this on Roots? The other 2 hardcore covers, Inhuman Nature and Crucificados Pelo Sistema, are good but sort of whizz by. Policia is by far the best of the 3, and a real classic.\n\nWar must be the darkest take on a Bob Marley tune ever, it's slow and brooding. It could definitely fit on Roots no problem, it has all the elements synomynous with Roots, but also has something different about it, which raises above the trudgery of those filler tracks which take up the bulk of the album. I think this would be fantastic live to hear, as it peaks and troughes, with more highs and lows and buildups in between than any other roots song. An atmospheric triumph.\n\nSymptom of the Universe is great. It is a real epic, far more spread out than most Sepultura songs, but it's certainly a classic. It's more riff-centred than War, the other real epic, but the acoustic interlude is nice and fun (Something not usually associated with Sepultura). I would like to have seen War, and Symptom released on an album proper, they're certainly good enough, but can understand why they would be reluctant to put covers on a full-length. \n\nMine and Lookaway are two of the strangest songs Sepultura ever wrote, Mine is not a bad song but Lookaway is still quite bloody terrible, even in remixed form. Dusted and Roots Bloody Roots are good in their demo forms, you can still see that there's work to be done, especially Roots, but all the basic ingredients are there. Drug Me is another throw-away punk cover. It's good, but like the other ones, it tends to whizz by without a chance to absorb it.\n\nThen, we comes to the live tracks. I personally like the intro to Refuse/Resist, it's very well done, and reminds somehow of something off of Pink Floyd's The Wall. The song bursts in to life and sounds great, if not much faster (Especially BTR, which sounds positively Death Metal and unbelievable!). It certainly doesn't have the sheen of the studio version, this is warts and all, crowd noises, mistakes and echoes thrown in. This certainly wasn't cleaned up in the studio afterwards. It all seems to be held together by some really flimsy glue, as if it could come apart any second now. The drums are more enthusiastic than the the studio, you can tell Iggor/Igor is putting his heart into this, and he is a fucking MACHINE, but they tend to be a bit too loud for my liking at times. They don't overpower, but they could be turned a touch. Nonethless, the mix is certainly great, and one of the best live mixes I've heard in a long time.\n\nThe only complaints I have about the live tracks is that 6 of them are from Chaos AD, with only a medley of BTR/Escape From The Void seeing anything else get a look in. Chaos AD IS my favourite Sepultura album, and I appreciate that this was recorded on the Chaos AD tour, but I would like to have seen something off of Arise or something else off of Schizophrenia or, maybe, something off of MV/BD. I cannot fault the choices of song from Chaos AD though, the electric Kaiowas is amazing, putting a whole new spin on the song. I imagine it would be amazing to hear this song live, a great experience definitely. The only song I could fault is maybe Clenched Fist, as personally I would've preferred Territory, but that's my own opinion. The only other fault is the fact that they only included part of the set, they've taken the first 7/8 songs of the set, unedited, with the speeches and everything, and then just cut the rest. I'm not a fan of including SOME of a live set, why not do the whole thing? I can appreciate why they would include these, Sepultura were a completely different, far angrier beast live than in record, and this documents it perfectly. But now they've released Under A Pale Grey Sky, it seems a bit pointless.\n\nAnd that's the thing that bugs me about this. Sepultura released another B-Sides/Rarities album entitled \"The Roots of Sepultura\" about 2/3 years before this, and an album the year before Blood Rooted entitled \"B-Sides\" which was near identical, bar a single edit and some other live tracks. What was the need for this release then? I believe this is the best of the three releases, but why did they even bother trying to release this, if it was all released the year before? This is more concise and detailed than B-Sides, and rarer than The Roots of Sepultura, as most of that was released (A year after it's original release!) as bonus tracks on the re-issue campaign. The only thing these release do is confuse people, and put them off, unless they're absolute completists who need EVERYTHING, in which case, most of the stuff which was on \"B-Sides\" and not here was just that, B-Sides to singles that they probably be better off buying instead.\n\nIn conclusion, this album is definitely a mixed bag. It takes elements of both good and bad rarities releases. All the stuff on here is rare (mostly) but comes sprinkled with demos and remixes which aren't exactly essential listening, but interesting nonetheless. It all smells vaguely of cash-in, because most of this stuff was release a year or 2 before on a similar compilation, and there had already been a rarities compilation before that. Nonetheless, the live material is a good insight into how Sepultura were far better in a live setting, but the gig is incomplete, and the demos do show raw forms of the songs, but there's no great differences, bar production quality and the odd riff which was fine-tuned later on.\n\nIf you are a completist, this is essential. There is so much here which should be heard by every manic Chaos AD fan. If you weren't impressed by Chaos AD or Roots, then don't buy this, you won't have a look in with old stuff. If you are looking to delve further and investigate Sepultura lesser-known songs, this is by far the best and most complete, as you'll have most of the stuff from The Roots of Sepultura on the re-issued albums. \n\nIf you are Roadrunner, get your act together. What needs to be done here is that you collate all the odds-and-ends from this, B-Sides, the Re-issues and The Roots of Sepultura and put them onto two discs, whilst giving the live concert on this album a full release on a third disc, either video or audio, becuase I'd love to hear it in full, then you give it some half-arsed name like \"Endangered Species\" or something, and then include a proper booklet, instead of pictures which are, admittedly, cool, but I'd rather have an interview or Bio or SOMETHING. Get it sorted.\n",
        "\nI've only recently gotten into the real Sepultura. And when I say real, I mean the old-school Sep when they released Schizophrenia and the like. When I was about thirteen or so, I was one of those idiotic JUMPDAFUCKUP types who dug Roots. \n\nThat was when I was stupid. \n\nI soon grew out of that phase and started to listen to thrash and later death metal, both genres in which Sepultura used to rip. So along comes an announcement that they're to make a new album. According to everyone on the Archives, Derrick Green sucks balls, so I've avoided anything Sepultura's released since Max's departure like the plague. However, when I saw the cover, I have to say, it kicked ass; it looked like Beneath the Remains, but cooler. I happen to follow the policy \"try before you buy,\" and holy shit, am I better off because of it.\n\nSince I hadn't experienced Green's vocals until this point, I went into this album with no idea what it would sound like. A-Lex I starts things off nicely, setting an excellent atmosphere with its combo of synths and guitars. Then comes the shit-storm; Moloko Mesto comes in with a thrash riff, which is apparently unheard of from Sepultura these days. I didn't know since is the first Sepultura album I've listened to since Roots. The problem is that the few thrash riffs are shit and the lyrics are idiotic and sound like someone in grade school wrote them. \n\nAnd the vocals. Oh the vocals.\n\nI've heard enough horror stories about this guy fill a book, but this blew me away in the worst way possible. I don't even know how to categorize the shit this guy spews forth and I'm sure as hell hard-pressed to call them vocals. Then it gets worse. Then comes the full-on groove. Next to nu metal, groove metal is one of my most hated forms of music, no thanks to shit like Roots and Vulgar Display of Power. You get the same riff played over and over again for twelve songs while Green unleashes his maelstrom of ear-sodomizing tuff-stuff shouts. Also, the vox are mixed in way too high in the mix; the shouts drown out most the other instruments.\n\nThe only songs that actually have any semblance of good are Ludwig Van and the rest of the A-Lex suite. I listen to some power metal these days, so I wasn't too horrified by Ludwig Van, but it just doesn't sound right. Still, it feels like it's over quicker than the other shorter songs and doesn't have any damnable vocals. The A-Lex movements are actually quite good though; They're short and set the mood well, sound fairly good and best of all, have no vox either. However, synths aren't exactly familiar territory for them, so all of them still sound out of place as well.\n\nSepultura's nadir came about when they were releasing things like Against and Nation with a couple attempted recoveries afterwards. Looks like those attempts were quashed when this turd came out; five DECENT songs out of eighteen. That's a problem. It's a shame to see a band once so good reduced to this state, it really is.\n",
        "\nFuck the naysayers, A-Lex might be one of the best albums of this year. In fact it might be one of the best albums in Sepultura's entire career. \n\nYeah that's right, I think A-Lex is just that good. \n\nThe album is a concept album for Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange (I've read the book, and watched half of the movie). It's base is aggressive groove. But from time to time, the band varies their groove by blending everything they've explored before. Sometimes it is thrash (\"Forceful Behavior\" almost sounds like Slayer), sometimes it's hardcore (\"Enough Said\"), and sometimes it's their past - \"Strike\" strongly reminds of Roots, as if it was an outtake from Roots. \"Ludwig Van\" is also worth a mention because, oddly enough, it's one of the several highlights, yet it's the weakest link at the same time. Usually the fusion of metal and classical music ends up being meaningless and disposable, but \"Ludwig Van\" is a bit of an exception. Sepultura's arrangement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony comes unexpected towards the end, and shows a trace of insanity. The middle section, right about from when Kisser's solo starts, is quite shmalzy to me, and hence the weakest moment of the album, but it starts and ends well like an appropriate and psychotic tribute to A Clockwork Orange (but certainly not to Beethoven himself). \n\nIn other moments, \"A-Lex\" I ~ IV serves to mark the beginning of each section, but they are unpredictably successful at segueing the dynamics of the music without being a silly filler. A-Lex also has a similar progression like Roots and Chaos A.D. where the latter tracks get less memorable, but in A-Lex, the music flows with ease, and with much more consistency than Sep's mid-90s outputs. Unlike their past groove-aggression albums, A-Lex storms through as if this is the musical equivalent of beautiful and highly skilled performance of capoeira. Overall, it does a superb job of recreating the \"concept\" of A Clockwork Orange, making it an enjoyable listen not only as a metalhead, but also someone familiar with the book (or the movie). \n\nAfter few listens of A-Lex, I cannot help but to be convinced that Max Cavalera is overrated as a creative force of Sepultura. Too many times does the credit to Sepultura masterpieces of Beneath the Remains - Roots era go to Max alone, and without any regard to Andreas Kisser. But the truth is that Sepultura always sounded like Sepultura, even after Derrick came in (by now, Max's vocals aren't realy missed on Sepultura albums to many open-minded people because Derrick proved himself to be a great vocalist). Departure of Igor Cavalera might be a great thing for Sep after all; it's not that Jean Donabella is better than Igor (but definitely a worthy replacement), but Sepultura should finally be judged fairly without any \"Cavaleras\" (ok, Igor's wife produced the album, but that doesn't count!). A-Lex should make people realize that Sepultura is Sepultura, with or without the Cavaleras. \n\nAll these years, Sepultura has worked hard to become one-of-a-kind metal band once again. Like their national football team, they are a group of stars that really wins by being team players. A-Lex is the proof. And this time they rightfully created their uniqueness by just the band members, and without high-profile nu-metal guests or exotic Brazilian tribal musicians.\n",
        "\nOriginally written for www.ultimate-guitar.com\n---\n\nQuite a lot has happened in the last few years regarding Sepultura and their related acts. First of all, in 2006 they released \u2018Dante XXI\u2019, their best album in 15 years. Shortly afterwards legendary drummer Igor Cavalera left the band; those who believe Sepultura \u2018died\u2019 after original frontman Max Cavalera stormed off certainly lost any remainder of hope. They, however, were given Cavalera Conspiracy, the reunion of the two Cavalera brothers and their none-too-shabby debut, \u2018Inflikted\u2019. Thing is though, the Sepultura name lives on and in case you hadn\u2019t noticed they\u2019ve come out with a new album called \u2018A-Lex\u2019. It is based on a similar premise to \u2018Dante XXI\u2019 \u2013 a groove filled hardcore/thrash album intertwined with a concept and some artistic flair; this time it is based on Anthony Burgess\u2019 \u2018A Clockwork Orange\u2019. There are some differences but there is one other important parallel to be drawn: it is the work of a tight unit, one that truly knows what it is doing.\n\nThe song title \u2018Filthy Rot\u2019 does, in many ways, sum up the aesthetic and feel of this album; it\u2019s very dark, very dirty and quite a grotesque beast to get your head around. However, that\u2019s the way Sepultura has always been, so any fan will probably be used to it. The performance of new drummer Jean Dolabella is absolutely crucial to holding the album together, but thankfully he, as Igor did before him, lets the band become so powerful in their chemistry that it doesn\u2019t even matter that we\u2019ve heard most of these riffs many times before. It is so typical of Sepultura for a collection of simplistic, groovy riffs to come together so well on the coattails of a stellar collective performance and, it should be noted, a fantastic production job that brings out the crunchy low-end of Paulo Junior in exquisite fashion. In typical concept album fashion, a lot of songs do not seem completed within themselves; instead segments of this rotten, clockwork fruit are joined together as if they\u2019re the results of a very refined jam, beginning and ending with the transitional \u2018A-Lex\u2019 tracks.\n\nAs you may have noticed if you\u2019ve ever owned a good set of ears, Derrick Green is a damn good vocalist. His domineering presence on a Sepultura record is only beaten by his absolute destruction of a live venue. Just as well, then, that he is only clutching your neck proverbially through a set of computer speakers. He is certainly far beyond the point of having anything to prove over his predecessor (though for the record, he is infinitely better than Mr. Cavalera), and it shows on his fifth album for the band. Lyrically though, this one\u2019s a bit of an oddball. A set of lyrics based on \u2018A Clockwork Orange\u2019 isn\u2019t too far removed from the agitated \u2018Rebel Yell\u2019 politics that often come attached to a Sepultura album. Maybe experts on the novel and Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film adaptation will be able to comment on accuracy and loyalty to the concept, but for the less well-read of us I will simply say that these lyrics are an interesting read.\n\n\u2018A-Lex\u2019 does bog down a little towards it's middle, but as always with an album like this there\u2019s that conveniently placed track that absolutely rips your gonads off right when you were thinking that the best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) was over; in this case that track is \u2018Conform\u2019. Even though the aforementioned grouping of tracks is important to the flow of the album, there are definitely some songs that stand out, namely \u2018Strike\u2019, \u2018We\u2019ve Lost You\u2019 and, as I said, \u2018Conform\u2019. The body of work as a whole though is solid provided you can excuse the peculiar \u2018Ludwig Van\u2019, and learn to realise that these four guys play music just as well as anyone who may have preceded them in this band.\n",
        "\nSepultura died a long time ago. I believe many, many folks in our fantastic metal community can agree they\u2019ve been down and out since \u201cRoots,\u201d and haven\u2019t put out anything worthwhile since 1991, although improving a little during \u201cDante XXI,\u201d but still no cigar. However, hasn\u2019t that vile consistency morphed into the gift that keeps on giving? After all, Sepultura waddles on with their loyal tribe of semi-stupid fans proudly creaming over whatever shitty record this awful group shoots out. So what\u2019s left? Try a few Brazilian assholes rolling in wads of cash once another abomination is created. What a shame. Sepultura inspired countless bands throughout those glory years, and now, we always prepare for the worst, as we shall most likely receive it.\n\nIs there any hope for this Brazilian (plus one American) faction? Why yes! It\u2019s the same band that popped out \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d and \u201cMorbid Visions,\u201d and YOU dare doubt their abilities? \u201cDante XXI\u201d showed new characteristics emerging within our good friends\u2026still groove-laden dung, but improvement is still improvement, and now they\u2019ll carry it over throughout \u201cA-lex\u201d with utmost power. But hold the fucking phone, there\u2019s more: it\u2019s a concept album about Clockwork Orange! So now we celebrate the illusion that writing a concept album instantly grants a flavorful effort like so many tools suppose! Oh praise the gods! \n\nDon\u2019t be shocked to know the truth: \u201cA-lex\u201d is a steaming dump. Wow, what a surprise: it\u2019s STILL groove metal without any sense of intelligence! Now someone trying to defend Sepultura in this situation (and they\u2019ll try, trust me) will respond by saying the following:\n\n\u201cNo way, faggot! The riffs are heavy as shit, drums are cool, and I JUmPDAFUCKUP!!!1!\u201d\n\nTo tame this profoundly retarded argument, simply begin musical dissection. First off, you\u2019ll need to point out that every song throughout \u201cA-lex\u201d has only one simple riff consisting of a few notes per cycle, lasting for minutes on end. Likewise, some little kid they selected for percussion duties proves his worthlessness as any beginner on the kit could easily perform everything performed by junior here. Overall though, Sepultura\u2019s poor gamble bankrupts their identity even more than before, because \u201dA-lex\u201d starts awful, stays awful, and ends awful. And yes, the guitar distortion is heavy. Big fucking deal.\n\nFrom this point on, Derrick Green will now be known as Peniscake. Since entering the picture after \u201cRoots,\u201d Peniscake has transformed Sepultura into a groove/hardcore faction responsible for such abominations as \u201cNation\u201d or \u201cAgainst,\u201d with \u201cA-lex\u201d continuing his otherworldly storm of diarrhea, now mightier than before. Peniscake\u2019s shouts reek of a poor hardcore vocalist stuck in a tough-guy tone, almost like he\u2019ll slug someone for no reason. It works pretty well for about two seconds, that is, before Peniscake becomes laughably bad. You\u2019ll laugh, find him annoying, and wish Sepultura had gone six feet under after the golden days were over. Thanks for kicking a dead horse, Peniscake.\n\nTo my amazement, \u201cA-lex\u201d occasionally provides good, honest passages that actually represent a real band playing music instead of a sell-out bucket of crud practically touching the scrotums of those modernized idiots following Sepultura. For instance, \u201cMoloko Mesto\u201d has a real thrash riff kicking off the record quite noticeably. Sure it\u2019s dull and generic, but for modern Sepultura, that\u2019s a step into the unknown. And I guess \u201cLudwig Van\u201d deserves a shout for its loopy expenditures and symphonic edge, even despite (you guessed it) the obsolete instrumentation rendering the entire concept of an orchestral cover useless. Ah Sepultura, you never fail to fail so hard.\n\nIf you were expecting some incredible rejuvenation of Sepultura\u2019s glorious pastime, forget about it. This album is a powerful contender for the worst item this faded group has ever conceived, even on par with \u201cRoots\u201d and \u201cNation\u201d in terms of piss-poor ideas. \u201cA-lex,\u201d on one hand, provides a slight stint of musical improvement throughout thin sections, but what doesn\u2019t look good really blows, even for Peniscake-era standards, which frankly demonstrates how awful this whole recording is during all eighteen tunes that preach worthlessness instead of concrete substance. Basically, it\u2019s modern Sepultura doing what modern Sepultura does best: sucking like a hooker with an anteater trunk. \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nFor who, like me, personally lived the enormous shining success of Sepultura, the \"Cavalera bros band\", in the middle nineties, it's very hard to review this \"A-Lex\", first album without any of the mentioned Cavalera bros. \n\nIndeed the common voice wants the true Sepultura to be Cavalera Conspiracy, whose shows are filled up with Sepultura songs. The quarrel will last for long, since as it seems Andreas Kisser and Paulo Jr. don't seem too willing to reunite, but what really matters is music; and on \"A-Lex\" there's a lot of music, and very good too. \n\nActually the post split Sepultura have always released nice albums (all in all even \"Against\"), with the single exception of \"Roorback\", while Soulfly spent half their career in the total flatness; but we must admit that, maybe after \"Nation\", this new work is the best outfit they've ever written. Once again we're talking of a concept, better managed if compared to \"Dante XXI\", maybe because the background theme is more fitting their sensibility: indeed the album is inspired by the famous \"A Clockwork Orange\" book, from which Kubrick realized a huge cinematographic masterpiece, and that gives the album its title (\"alex\" is the name of the protagonist, but also means \"without law\").\n\nAnd so the 18 tracks of the album are as many bullets with a short length, no matter what their rhythms are (only \"Sadistic Values\", very articulated, and \"Ludwig Van\", an atypical symphonic metallic collage, are over 5 minutes), and we're not surprised to know it's the result of 3 months of jamming. \n\nIt's one of the most various albums in their whole career, including fast thrash core attacks (\"Moloko Mesto\", \"The Treatment\", \"Forceful Behaviour\", \"Enough Sai\", \"Paradox\"), typical grooves (\"What I Do!\", \"Metamorphosis\", \"The Experiment\"), and some atypical solutions (\"Filthy Rot\" is a successful Meshuggah syncope, \"Ludwig Van\", as said, a symphonic track, \"Sadistic Values\" in its first half a melodic slow lullaby). \n\nAt times something does not roar at full throttle, but undoubtedly the album is very nice, under every point of view, and grows a lot with the listens going by. No matter who's playing the drums or guitars. \n\nOriginally written for Silent Scream http://www.silentscreamzine.com/Home.asp?Lang=ENG\n",
        "\nI guess that I am one of the few (and the proud) who actually likes Sepultura post-Max (I also like Max-era Sepultura and Soulfly). I thought that Against and Dante XXI were great albums, and A-Lex is of similar quality. In fact, the only post-Max Sepultura album that I was disappointed with was Roorback. I\u2019ll admit that Max Cavalera was a better vocalist than Derrick Green because of his personality and charisma (and talent). However, Green is no slouch. His vocals on A-Lex (and previous releases) are of high quality. The range of his vocals on A-Lex is quite impressive. He often sounds fairly similar to Max Cavalera (like Max without a thick accent), but he also employs occasional death metal-style vocals and other types of singing.\n\nA-Lex is a concept album, but I don\u2019t care about that. What matters is if it is enjoyable, compelling, and interesting. It is. A-Lex is dynamic. It includes dramatic variations in tempo, musical style, and volume. As a result, it is never boring. Every instrument is employed with abundant variation. Andreas Kisser\u2019s guitar performances are particularly impressive. His best guitar work on the album occur when he employs simple riffs inside a heavy groove. Although this album does provide occasional surprises, it is comprised primarily of straight-forward metal that is fast, heavy, and intense. In fact, if it wasn\u2019t for the five instrumental tracks (out of 18 tracks total), I would have had no idea that this was a concept album at all. Although the instrumentals are quite good and are strategically sequenced on the album, they sometimes do more harm than good by breaking the flow and momentum of the songs with vocals (which are faster and heavier).\n\nThe lengthiest instrumental track is dramatically different than the rest of the album. It is comprised of music composed by Beethoven and is given a (partial) metal makeover, reminiscent of the classical/metal sections of Savatage\u2019s Dead Winter Dead album. Overall, A-Lex is a very satisfying slab of post-Max Sepultura that should appeal to those who enjoyed Dante XXI and other Derrick Green albums.\n",
        "\nA-Lex is Sepultura\u2019s 11th album and is due out later this month. It\u2018s based on Anthony Burgess\u2019 A Clockwork Orange and A-Lex means \u201cno law\u201d in Russian or something like that. Now, I haven\u2019t heard the band since Against came out but I did see them live in 2007 and they put on one hell of a show and kicked a lot of ass. Derek Green had a commanding presence on stage and new drummer Jean Donabella seemed like a worthy replacement for Igor Cavalera.\n\nI was expecting another dull retread of past glories mixed with modern trends in the vein of Cavalera Conspiracy and the last Soulfly album but A-Lex caught me by surprise. The album has some great songs and sounds like the work of a band that had something to prove. There\u2019s a fair mix of older sounds and newer directions and the band sounds tight and focused. There is a fair bit of the percussive tribal element from Roots, there\u2019s also the thrashing of Schizophrenia and Beneath the Remains although that\u2019s in the minority, there are a lot of fat grooves aka Chaos AD and there\u2019s even some Meshuggah style dissonant chug. It all works quite well together and it\u2019s all held together by a sterling performance from new drummer Jean Donabella.\n\nStand out tracks include Filthy Rot which manages to mix up some tribal sounding vocal chants with Meshuggah style riffing, The Treatment which has a lot of Chaos AD and Roots in it, Metamorphosis is a slow burning mid tempo thrasher that sounds great, Sadistic Values is the longest song on the album is a moody heavy song with a cool tempo shift halfway through and Forceful Behavior sounds as old school as anything they\u2019ve done in a long while. There are no bad songs here. The only complaint is that at just a little less than an hour\u2019s worth of music and 18 songs, it\u2019s a bit long to take in one sitting and the album could have been shortened a bit. Ludwig Van is Beethoven\u2019s 9th Symphony played by Kisser and the band and while it may have been essential to the concept and they must have had to include it, it does break the flow of the album, especially coming as it does after the aggressive and punchy old school vibe of Enough Said.The only real problem with A-Lex is that there a few too many songs on it. The second half of the album especially feels stretched out and like it may not ever end.\n\nHaving said all of that, this is a pretty good album and way better than what I was hoping for. It\u2019s an album that\u2019s going to grow on you the more you listen to it and it is far superior to the last Soulfly or Cavalera Conspiracy albums. It\u2019s also remarkably free of any of the currently fashionable trends. Check it out. You just might be pleasantly surprised.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nWith all the respect due to this band, Sepultura is not the same band after Max left. I know, I can be monotonous and this point has been already touched by many but the differences from the first to the second period of the long history of this band are just incredible. Actually, even with Max in the line-up we could already notice changes in the sounds, if compared to the primordial violence of the early albums. Chaos AD and Roots were representative of this choice to change direction, filling the sound with tribal influences and lots of genres coming form outside, like hardcore, groove and even a bit of industrial (a thing that Max decided to use on bigger quantity on the Nailbomb project). \nMax\u2019s influences on the band were undeniable, his image will always be related to Sepultura and now that even Igor has gone away from this band to join the brother, I think Sepultura should change the name.\n\nI respect Paulo Jr. and Kisser (let\u2019s remember the innovations this lead guitarist brought after Morbid Visions) but now it\u2019s time to change. If till Dante XXI the fans could have been a bit in trouble in \u201cchoosing\u201d the band to follow (Soulfly, Sepultura and now Cavalera Conspiracy), I think they now have the definitive occasion. However, let\u2019s remind that few of the old school fans are still there and I consider myself one of those. I\u2019ve decide to constantly listen to the old efforts, the real ones by Sepultura. Since Against I\u2019ve always tried a quite logical and mature approach to this new Sepultura \u201cversion\u201d but any time I listened to something new, my disappointment was too big. Even this time I tried a mature, objective approach to this new album A-Lex but this mission has not been accomplished. \n\nIt\u2019s a pity because even the cover artwork was bounded to an older conception of it. The logo was like the one on Beneath the Remains and the \u201csculpture\u201d in the centre reminds the ones on Chaos AD or Arise; unfortunately the music is quite distant in quality and aggression from the one on those albums. If Dante XXI was remarkable for its acceptable length, despite the quite lame music inside, the new album points on the length and on the number of the tracks. I\u2019ve always sustained and I will always do that the perfect length for an album like this one should not surpass the forty minutes. Here, we have almost sixty minutes of music and you all know how it is difficult to maintain the same level of songwriting for the entire album. To this, let\u2019s add the music itself (grooving hardcore) and the scenario is complete. \n\n\u201cA-lex I\u201d is an intro with gloomy sounds from beyond as the first riffs come in. The distortion is quite acceptable because quite raw and pounding. For the drums we can say the same thing and so far nothing wrong. \u201cMoloko Mesto\u201d has a truly brutal beginning with lots of up tempo and riffs. The production on these faster parts is quite messy and the sounds melt down in a confusing progression. The stops are full of tribal and weird passages. The vocals by Derrick Green are simply not adapt for Sepultura even if they are OK for the new direction. However, I can\u2019t stand them. \u201cFilthy Rot\u201d displays the very first evident groove elements, stop and go by the guitars and the artificial noises. The clean vocals parts are just terrible in their will to be ritual and tribal. \n\nWhat is quite enjoyable here is the way they succeeded in creating a quite occult and dark atmosphere. \u201cWe\u2019ve Lost You\u201d follows more progressive and groove patterns with lots of weird passages like also \u201cWhat I Do\u201d that, by the way, is a bit more on speed. Fortunately all the tracks on this album are quite short. \u201cA-lex II\u201d is again groove on the second part before the heavier but always quite annoying \u201cThe Treatment\u201d. Some good up tempo parts and more classical riffs are to appreciate but forget the stop and go. \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d features arpeggios and always grooving structures with slow patterns and weird sounds. The same can be said for the following, longer \u201cSadist Values\u201d. \n\n\u201cForceful Behaviour\u201d has something stranger for the vocals and the riffs are always quite fast, detaching a bit from the drumming that is fast just on some sections. The return to the hyper annoying groove is called \u201cConform\u201d. \u201cA-lex III\u201d features again dark sounds before the mid-paced overtures and the almost rap vocals on \u201cThe Experiment\u201d. Some sections feature fast restarts but they last for few seconds and they are submerged by high doses of groove. \u201cStrike\u201d is always similar to the other songs with plenty of mid-paced section, groove riffs and distorted vocals. \u201cEnough Said\u201d contributes in raising the violence and the speed before the violins and the doomy, weird structure of \u201cLudwig Van\u201d as tribute to the great composer. \n\n\u201cAlex IV\u201d features calmer notes with a strange, distorted break by the middle before the faster \u201cParadox\u201d, featuring thrash riffs and up tempo sections. However, they don\u2019t forget the groove influences by the middle and we finish this album in this way. To pay homage to A Clockwork Orange, Sepultura put out another pointless release. This band should simply change name if they want to go on like this, but maybe it\u2019s not my business. My only recommendation is to let you know that here there\u2019s almost nothing of the old school brutality and don\u2019t be taken in by old school oriented cover artwork. I don\u2019t want to slander this band but this is enough, and acting like this they\u2019ve already ruined the memories of a shining past. \n\nHowever, for those who loved the more recent efforts, this one can be good for you but, old school fans, avoid A-lex.\n",
        "\nAs I mentioned in my review of Against, I used to really like this album. It was my favourite Derrick Green-era Seps album by far. But now I'm not sure. Songs I really loved off of this album, Border Wars and One Man Army seem vapid and dull when I listen to them now, so I thought I'd give this a listen again and see what was what.\n\nI still contend that Sepulnation is a fantastic song, I still love that song. With a great drumbeat and inspired, simplistic lyrics, it's still one of Sepultura's \"greatest hits\" in my opinion and still one of the shining lights of the Green era. Revolt is the now-mandatory short fast shock of a hardcore song which worked with Biotech is Godzilla and Dictatorshit, as well as the absolutely epic Reza off of Against, but compared to these 3 absolute wonders, this fails miserably. Although it's nothing too terrible, it simply passes you by with a notice and finishes too quickly and too abruptly. The demo version of the song included with this Special Edition is actually longer than the song itself, at about 3 minutes or so, so why did they feel the need to cut it MORE?\n\nBorder Wars and One Man Army are as mentioned, not bad but tediously boring after a while.. Vox Populi is more of the same whilst The Ways of Faith adds some brooding psychedelic guitar work, which just comes off as quite damn boring but at least it's a change. Uma Cura sounds like an uninspired version of Ratamahatta or Umbaraumba, with the generic Brazilian tribal percussion and some funk-style bass. Who Must Die has much of the same forced-Roots style, but is a bit more enjoyable. \n\nSaga is actually quite enjoyable, a bit more up-tempo than the rest of this stuff and it isn't marred by the annoying bouts of Experimentation that marr the other songs because, although there is Experimentation, it actually bloody works! Tribe To A Nation, once you get past the really fucking annoying Reggae parts is still nothing to write home about although shows a bit of promise. Politricks is quite interesting, beign more of a brooding piece, relying on a near Spoken Word style of vocals from Jello Biafra where the Lyrics are the main focus of the song. Human Cause is another highlight of this album, despite only being about 50 seconds long. Reject is another highlight, this album definitely picks up the further you progress. You could almost say that the tracklisting is subconsciously linked to the whole Sepulnation concept by making you sit through several mind-numbingly boring tracks before giving you some rewards. Strength through endurance, and whatnot. \n\nThe song Water is quite a departure for Sepultura. It takes the slow, bare concept of Uma Cura and Who Must Die? to it's literal conclusion, akin to songs like Kaiowas and Itsari, but with vocals. The clean vocals are surprisingly good and work well, it's clear to see Green's other influences such as Reggae coming through in his delivery. Valtio is a great piece, although not really a song with a discernible structure. It's a symphonic Instrumental piece with the lads from Apocalyptica on Cello (who must've been absolutely chuffed seeing as they're all huge Sepultura fans) and it works really well. It could also be seen as a progression of Kamaitachi off of Against, and also a direct precursor to the grand Symphonic elements of Dante XXI.\n\nThe bonus songs are fairly interesting, but nothing matching anything by Max. Bela Lugosi's Dead is actually fairly enjoyable, despite being yet another brooding, slow piece. But the next songs, Annihilation and Rise Above, are definitely worth a mention. They are great and it would have been great if Sepultura had done more stuff like this on the actual album. This is all fairly fast, compared to the album which you've just listened through. Why couldn't they write some stuff like this, which is far faster, and is more enjoyable. The demo of Revolt is slower than the song which made the album, I think, but I definitely enjoy it more. It actually sounds like a live recording! The live version of Roots Bloody Roots was probably something of a revelation to the Seps fanbase, as this was the first opportunity to own Green singing Max-era songs live. It's not bad, but the guitars sound plain wrong and the bass seems a bit out of tune. Anyway, if you wanted Green-era live tracks, you'd be better off buying Live In Sao Paolo.\n\nThe problem here is not Derrick Green, far from it. Green puts in a commendable, if somewhat monotone, performance throughout and the addition of clean vocals at least shows some innovation on his part. It's the lack of riffs that Kisser is producing. Most of them are your standard mid-paced hardcore riffs mixed with a bit of Chaos AD/Roots, then adding some experimentation, for the sake of it. Sepultura have (quite literally) locked themselves into a groove on this one, this all follows the same basic formula (mostly) of Verse-Chorus-Verse-Chorus-Roots Experimentation/Solo-Chorus and it becomes tedious. The riffs used on these songs aren't actually that ba, but they're similar and used too bloody much. These songs could be cut down in length and this album could've far better if it was just bloody shorter. \n\nIgor Cavalera puts in a commendable performance with some neat drum parts, the Intro to Sepulnation for example, but this is nothing compared to Chaos AD, Roots or even BTR/Arise. Paolo Jr. must have been giddy with excitement on this album though. You can actually fucking hear him! He has so many solo parts where it's just him and Igor, he must've been like a kid on Christmas! He puts in a really good performance, complementing the rest fo the band perfectly.\n\nI should probably mention the production as well. It's good, nothing near as terrible to make it out to be. It's just your average modern-day Sepultura production, nothing too left-field or avant-garde. All the instruments are clearly audible and the only criticism I can think of is the guitar. The guitar tone isn't exactly Beneath The Remains, it's all a bit paper thin, but it still does it's job of making the music soudn heavy. Although not the kind of tone I would want for my band, it works nonetheless. The other thing I can see as being a pain would be the sound manipulation and effects. This album is drowned in strange effects, especially the Guitar and they can seem unnecessarily excessive at times, but nothing which would make me hate this album with a passion.\n\nThere is some interesting stuff on this album though, for example, the whole Sepulnation concept. The Spoken Word parts are quite nice and the idea of a musical \"bed\" underneath each of the quotes is an interesting. The lyrics are fairly intelligent and well thought-out, if not sometimes a bit average. The artwork is definitely something special, especially on this limited edition digipak version I have. It includes some beautiful Stalin-esque propaganda which is simply a joy to look at, and the whole red, yellow and black colour scheme is such a delight to the eyes. This has to be the best artwork Sepultura have ever had.\n\nIt's a shame that Sepultura didn't take this whole Nation concept further, onto Roorback and further, with maybe a song dedicated to the concept on Roorback or something. I also wish they'd been a bit more hands-on in their approach. Maybe they could've incorporated into their live shows a bit more, or even got the fan club to do something \"revolutionary\" to promote it. There is a whole mine of ideas which they could've used, but they didn't. They simply dropped the idea once the Nation tour was finished and buried it away never to be resurrected, moving onto Roorback without even a thought for the concept. Oh well, c'est la vie.\n\n7/8 years on, and we are no closer to an independent Sepulnation (Well, not without a reunion with the Cavaleras, we aren't). This isn't a great loss, to be honest. I don't think Andreas Kisser is really fit to lead this band, never mind his own country. After listening to this album once again, I've noticed I have a vastly different view from the last time I listened to this. I thought this album trailed off after a while, the first time round that I heard it. But I now notice that this album goes in waves, some not bad songs to start off with, then a big tidal wave of mediocrity, then some more good songs at the end. Nation is not a terrible album by any stretch of the imagination, but it suffers from a lack of ideas. The ideas which are there (the experimentation factor) tend to be below par, considering the triumph that was Roots, and seem to be rehashed. \n\nThat said, the tribal experimentation has been toned down considerably from Roots and Against, and would be toned down even more on Roorback. This album depends on good riffs and simply doesn't have it. These too seem like reheated leftovers which are used way too much. These songs are too long and too identical. \n\nOverall, this is a good concept, which is poorly executed and let down by lacklustre songwriting. In terms of Sepultura's back catalogue, I'd say leave this near the bottom. Buy all of the Max-era albums as well as A-Lex and Dante XXI first. If you're a fan of Chaos AD and Roots, there will be some songs on this you will like, such as Sepulnation or Saga. If you're one of those people who worship Morbid Visions/Bestial Devestation who believe Sepultura went downhill after 1986, then this won't convert you. \n\nAlthough not essential listening, it is good to have to complete your collection, but only if it's cheap (Which is no doubtedly will be). This is not worth splashing out top dollar on, to get imported in or anything. I got this for \u00a36 and it took me about 6 months of persuading and a slow day in Avalanche Records to make me buy this. It should be the same for you.\n",
        "\nThis album gets ALOT of undue flack from the metal community. It seems that this album along with Roots tends to be the whipping boys of Sepultura's career(Roots deserves it though, but I digress). Let's give a little history lesson on how Sepultura came to unleash Against. 1996 through 1998 was a turbulent time for the thrashers from Brazil; Max Cavalera got his way and they let loose the steaming pile that was Roots, then Sepultura got tired of Max always getting his way due to his wife being their manager, so they decided to sever ties with her as their manager but were willing to work with Max and his wife as his manager. Well, Max, took this personally and bailed, talked a shit load of crap about the band, formed a new ungodly abomination that is Soulfly, and pronounced Sepultura dead. Well contrary to King Max's decree, the band picked up the pieces and decided to continue with a new singer. Many sent in their demos, doing their best Roots era Max impersonation, and Sepultura decided that they didn't want to go in that direction. Enter Derrick Green, the man who would replace Max. Time to hit the studio.\n\nNow with that outta the way, we get to the album; Against. And what we have here is an album born out of sheer anger and frustration. Fans had begun to write Sepultura off, and began to embrace Soufly. Max slammed his former band mates any chance he got publicly. Soulfly had sections of songs that were directed right at Sepultura, so they decided to answer back, but in a different direction. One they had explored with Chaos A.D., groove meets hardcore, with surprising results.\n\nAgainst opens with it's title track, starting with some ambiet sounds before ripping into a vicious drum pattern. Then the guitar kicks in, and what we hear is vastly different from what we last heard for the boys from Brazil. Gone are the meandering, plodding, downtuned single note riffs, in their place intense, crossover punk/thrash styled aggression. Gone are the horrible nu metal styled broken english grunts Max so lovingly perfected on Roots, in their place Derrick Green's massive roar of voice. After plowing you down with the one minute and some change opener, comes Choke. If the song Against is a bit off putting at first, Choke brings you back to the Chaos A.D. styled comfort zone. Heavy, groovy, with a touch of thrashiness, Choke hits you harder then a ton of bricks, and sets you in for the new album. Heavy, thick, aggressive, and just plain pissed off plays through out the whole album. Most of which is quite enjoyable and very headbang and mosh worthy, especially my personal favorite on the entire album, Common Bonds. This song hits you hard over the the head with heaviness, and showcases Green's vocal range, something Sepultura never(and probably couldn't) explored with Max.\n\nYou may be asking yourself, \"If you got so much prais for the album, why only give 80%?\" Well, here's your answer, while Against is filled with some great moments, there is also some boing filler bits as well. Tribus is boring, and is played at full length at the end of the album. F.O.E. and Unconscious are forgettable, Reza is cool for about thirty seconds, then gets irritating, and Hatred Aside is just all over the place and inconsistent.\n\nAll in all, Against catches way too much flack. Alot of people want to compare this to classic Sep, like BTR or Arise, and you just can't. Against has more in common with Chaos A.D. than their early albums, but even then it's an entirely different animal all together. It's a pissed off, aggression fest, worthy of a listen with open ears. Highly recommended.\n\nStand out songs: Against, Choke, Rumors, Old Earth, Common Bonds.\n",
        "\nThere is a certain class of albums that are, by their very nature, utterly repulsive to anyone who loves heavy metal, particularly the brand that existed before 1992. It isn\u2019t so much a matter of the music contained within not being aggressive enough, technically proficient enough, or that the lyrics aren\u2019t conducive to the multifaceted nature of the style per say. If those were the standard, this band\u2019s classic debut \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d wouldn\u2019t be lauded as a grand pioneering effort by many fans of thrash, death, and black metal respectively. The ultimate issue is what the culture it represents holds in opposition to metal culture, and consequently the manner in which the music is presented in the sum of all its various parts.\n\nSepultura\u2019s \u201cRoots\u201d doesn\u2019t really qualify as groove metal or industrial metal in the general sense as its predecessor did, nor is it fully in the realm of avant-garde music or nu-metal. It\u2019s sort of stuck in between all of those, and basically functioned as a template that greatly influenced all of those various off-shoots in certain respects after its release. It was itself heavily influenced by newer sounds such as Korn\u2019s mallcore creation, Faith No More\u2019s experimental material, as well as the slowly emerging rap/rock scene known today as nu-metal, underscored by the fact that central figures in all 3 scenes provided guest work on here. To a zombie-like adherent of pop culture, this is the perfect stew of every dumb assed form of pop/rock that was burning up the top 200 at the time with a hodgepodge of artsy nonsense which had slightly less of a following, but to someone who expects metal in their speakers, it's nothing more than a random mess of decrepit mainstream drivel. If there were an actual school where one learned to trade in their metal credentials for a diploma/stamp of approval in the fine art of crappy rock music (which I have dubbed The Royal Seal of Gayness), this release would be its valedictorian. \n\nThe complete departure from anything resembling a recognizable form of metal covers every second of sonic diarrhea splashed upon this piece of toilet paper that happens to be shaped like a CD and playable in a CD player. Evil sounding death barks are nowhere to be found, as good old Max Cavalera has decided that imitating Jonathan Davis\u2019 whinny yells and incoherent mumbles is the way to go here. Fast and fun drum beats have been traded in for hypnotic drum beats and random tribal percussive interludes, both of which clash with each other completely and sound as if someone is playing two different songs simultaneously through the same stereo system. The guitars are as muddy as a swamp of coccidian infested elephant excrement that listen about as sour as the actual condition would smell in reality, and the riffs consist mostly of 2 note/chord drudgery that is repetitive enough to make \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d sound like \u201cBeneath The Remains\u201d. Throw in a few really comical sounding effects such as record scratches; overly present vocal distortion, dissonant 2 note tremolo leads with effects that make them sound even more out of tune, and a whole bunch of other crap that should never be mixed in together.\n\nAlthough differentiating each individual song is not extremely difficult due to the wide variety of elements at play, nothing on here can really be enjoyed if you liked any of this band\u2019s past work, particularly their 80s albums. Anyone suggesting as such is not doing so because they listen to music on the merits, but because they are subject to the indoctrination of mainstream music via the radio. \u201cRoots Bloody Roots\u201d introduces us to the 2 note goodness of modern mallcore riffing, borrowing heavily from Korn\u2019s debut both musically and vocally. There are probably 4 actual riffs to this whole song, but if you cancel out distinctions between riffs consisting of single notes versus ones that follow the same pattern and rhythm but use power chords, there are only 2. This form of non-variation is bolstered a little by annoying high end guitar screeches loaded with processed flanger effects and a slight change in beat to give the illusion of variation, but really what you get is 3 and \u00bd minutes of Cavalera crying like a bitch in heat overtop of an extremely annoying, one-dimensional, droning background.\n\nFrom here on in, we get various regurgitations of this simpleton approach to song creation, making one wonder if this entire album was written over a weekend with Patton and Davis coaching the band on what will get them radio play. \u201cAttitude\u201d and \u201cCut\u201d have a little more variation to them; the latter actually has a little guitar solo that would be good if it wasn\u2019t drowned in maxed out flanger effects, but the vocals are so high in the mix you can hardly make out what\u2019s going on beneath them, not that you\u2019d actually want to. \u201cRamatahatta\u201d takes the same 2 or 3 note droning, mud stomping, guitar groove style and loads it up with weird percussive tribal lingo out of some guest vocalist and Cavalera in a question and response style that sounds more like someone beating on a plastic bucket than an actual person talking. \u201cBreed Apart\u201d ratchets up the lameness further still with a complete imitation of both Davis\u2019 bitchy yells and his disturbingly erotic whisper/speak. Parts of this have riffs consisting of one note, so of course we need to mask it with more Brazilian percussion and studio gimmicks, like pouring a gallon jug of perfume on a mud drenched warthog.\n\nOn and on this thing plods through the sewage drenched seas of groovy sludge, occasionally morphing into something tribal sounding, while at others just loading up on the rap and ambient guitar nonsense and being even more unlistenable. \u201cStraighthate\u201d starts off with this really annoying one note bass drone loaded with feedback drenched guitar harmonics that sound like a tiger mauling a chalk board with its front claws. At about the 1:15 mark we get about 10 seconds of pure groove metal where we have a unified arrangement and an actual guitar riff to speak of, but what little enjoyment might be gotten from it is utterly destroyed by the mess that follows it. That\u2019s basically how the album functions, every now and then, they\u2019ll revisit their groove/thrash past here and there as if to remind the listener that this used to be a metal band and torture him further. \u201cSpit\u201d annoys the listener further still by actually taking out a lot of the studio gimmicks and putting in 3 or 4 half-decent groove riffs, but compensates for this obvious positive by making Cavalera\u2019s distortion steeped voice so ridiculously loud in the mix that you can\u2019t hear it half of the time.\n\nIf one were to ignore the 13 minute jam session at the end of this and focus on the 15 actual songs (I use this term loosely of course), at this point we come to the center and the trough of this seemingly endless valley of garbage in \u201cLookaway\u201d. If you ignore the 3 way vocal gimp festival going on and just focus on the guitars, what you have are verse sections that literally sound like an extended fart sample. The lyrics on this literally sound like they are referring to a vagina being violated, although superimposing the vocalists themselves into the picture, 3 vaginas would be the actuality of it. Hearing Cavalera and Davis at the same time, it is definitely clear that the former is a little manlier in sound, but that\u2019s not saying much. Patton is basically just blurting out gibberish at random, serving only to throw off any sense of rhythmic cohesion that this fudge dragon of a song actually possesses. As a whole, this monstrosity is the worst thing ever to be put to music; the world\u2019s largest brontosaurus enema couldn\u2019t clean this thing up.\n\nIn keeping with the capricious nature of mainstream taste, some acoustic stuff highlighting some false sense of versatility becomes obligatory, so let us proceed to the twin odes to the primitive in \u201cIasco\u201d and \u201cItsari\u201d. I\u2019m not fully opposed to the idea of meshing Brazilian tribal chant and percussion with metal music, as Angra actually did a decent job of it on \u201cHoly Land\u201d, but this is just utterly boring. \u201cItsari\u201d is basically a near carbon copy of \u201cKaiowos\u201d with sampled chants in the background, while \u201cIasco\u201d is similar sounding to the same \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d song but is about half as long yet meanders twice as much. If you put both of these songs on a continued loop and subjected every environmental activist on the planet to it for 30 minutes, you\u2019d likely see the world singing in unison for the final solution to the rainforest question and could then make a killing in the chainsaw and torch business once slash and burn policies began to commence.\n\nIf you\u2019ve managed to suffer through the entire duration of the first 14 songs, we are greeted with one song that actually passes for metal, albeit something along the lines of thrash/crossover with pretty poor vocals. For all of its lyrical stupidity and horribly over-distorted vocals, \u201cDictatorshit\u201d has a good riff or two buried in the arrangement and a guitar solo that would be good if it wasn\u2019t buried under too many effects. Unfortunately, being just over a minute in time length, the song presents itself not so much as a breath of fresh air after nearly an hour of torturous suffocation, but as an insult to the listener by reminding them that this band is capable of rocking out, but utterly refuses to do so. Why the fuck would you put one decent little ditty right at the end of a mountain of dog shit? It makes zero sense logically, although given the influences at work here; it actually makes perfect sense nonetheless.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be a pioneer of something as terrible as mallcore like Korn was, it is quite another to be a well established thrash act from the 80s who pioneered the death metal style, and then jumped on board the latest fad like a whore onto her next customer. The fact that this new customer (genre) is ugly as hell only further adds insult to injury. You can get a level of enjoyment out of Pantera\u2019s and Machine Head\u2019s music from this time period, regardless how inferior the music is, but this just has nothing redeeming to speak of. It has rightfully earned not only the honor of being stamped with The Royal Seal of Gayness, but the top status as valedictorian of the class for its helping spread the mallcore virus through the classrooms of crappy core high school, where all metal ceases to be.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on October 11, 2008.\n",
        "\nSepultura is a band that doesn't need an introduction. These guys completely dominated the world with albums like \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d and \u201cArise\u201d. Back then, they were on the top of their game with an highly energetic brand of aggressive, sometimes even death metal-influenced thrash metal.\n\nSure, the turning point for Sepultura was already given with their highly controversial album \u201cChaos AD\u201d but to me, the exitus happened with \u201cRoots\u201d and particularly the main song of this very single, \u201cRatamahatta\u201d. It has everything a so called \u201csell-out\u201d needs: \n\na (then) trendy nu-metal track with random tribal drumming and ridiculous vocals\na shorter, more radio-friendly edit of said track\na dumb cover which supposedly \u201cfits\u201d their new style \nunnecessary, same-y sounding demo versions of famous songs \u2013 to fill the space\nsub par live recordings of the most accessible songs of their past career\n\nYeah, this about sums it up. The title track of this single sounds like everything else that's popular in those times \u2013 horribly down tuned guitars, angst-ridden tough-guy shouts, retarded lyrics (of course, the obligatory \u201cfuck\u201d appears on the lyrics sheet) and simple-as-fuck compositions. The only thing that sounds remotely different is the never-ending stupid mumbling in the background, but that's not exactly a positive thing. \n\nThe Bob Marley cover is, of course, shit \u2013 it's horribly overlong and nothing more than a butchery of the original track (which I don't even like very much). It suffers from the same factors that made the title track unbearable. \n\nAs I mentioned, the demo versions are worthless. Even if I liked those songs, they practically sound the same as their later album counterparts, apart from a slightly worse production job and a few notes changed here and there (mostly on \u201cDusted\u201d). \n\n\u201cSlave new World\u201d was one of the most accessible and also crappiest songs on \u201cChaos AD\u201d and that's probably why it was chosen to appear on here. Max' vocals sound worse than on the studio recording and the overall instrumentation sounds sloppier, even though the song is simple as fuck. Well, they had their fame, so why bother learning the songs properly? \n\n\u201cInner Self\u201d should be a good track. But on here, it's not. Main reason for this being the dumb idea to mix it with the horrid and slow \u201cAmen\u201d to form a live medley. Obviously, the two hugely different songs don't fit together in the least, granting a truly disturbing experience; Max also uses his angsty tough-guy shouts instead of his long-gone vocal talents back on the studio recording of \u201cBeneath the Remains\u201d, but that had to be expected firsthand. \n\nSo what else is to say about this single? Well, not much, really. It's best to avoid it like the plague, the same thing you should do with the album this stems from, because from this day on, they'd ditch the thrash for mainstream audiences' cash.\n",
        "\nEverything in this album is punishing! You know the kind of metal that tells you fucking do what I say! OBEY ME! That is what this metal is about.\n\nOkay let\u2019s start with the production, Sepultura released great albums before this, just somewhat bad production, well not bad after all, just bad when compared to this production. Come to think about it, Schizophrenia with this production would sound better than it does and I only thought so after listening to this album. The whole sound is just clear, yet aggressive, sharp and tight. The previous albums probably had a \u201cnastier\u201d production, but this is the sound of pure hostility, the sound of all what is stronger than hate.\n\nThe drumming by Igor is just very vigorous, and precise, and sounds volatile with the riffs being played. You know they sound thunderous just like those shells that put everything beneath the remains. Actually, the drums drew my attention as much as the drums on Darkness Descends did. This album needed an aggressive and tight performance on the drums, to add to the overall volatile feel of the album and thus, probably would have been flawed if Igor had not executed this perfect drumming on this album.\n\nThe vocals are to the death side of metal, and they\u2019re punishing ; this is my favourite vocal style in thrash metal, to be honest. They are belligerent, retaining the speed of thrash metal vocals, yet adding a whole lot of hostility and coarseness in their delivery.\n\n\u2026 and the solos, just like albums as \u201cNone so Vile\u201d, they have this character that identifies them yet they never take over; the solos are just another aspect of the album that complements it.\n\nBUT forget everything said (well not really, just consider this line as an emphasis on what I will say), what is most punishing ( said it alot already eh ?), and the ultimate highlight are the fucking riffs. Some of the best thrash riffs in the whole thrash metal genre (and metal as a whole) are Where? where? where? where? HERE ! Here\u2019s quality and quantity, and with that sick, heavy, thrashy guitar tone it has, the riffs only sound more intriguing. Forget catchy, although Stronger than Hate\u2019s main riff is all you\u2019ll be humming in the next half of your life, yes forget that Beneath the Remains\u2019 first riff will haunt your dreams, they just dominate. You want the riffs to be catchy? or headbanging ? or aggressive ? or what ? This is a real perfect combination of all. One also gets his share of spine-chills too, listen to that break when the solo of Mass Hypnosis kicks in, just amazing.\n\nI usually tend to have problems going through an entire album, even if it has some classic songs and then a bad one, I kind of find that somewhat repellent, but nothing like that to find here. This is just one of those unrelenting albums; No silly melodic passages that make you pray that they end (probably just some exclusive ones to make you breathe every 10 minutes or so), just an onslaught of madness of a once great thrash band. Yes ONCE, which brings us to why this is one of the biggest misfortunes in metal. I rather like to look at it this way ; I don\u2019t hate Sepultura because they are a mallcore band; I hate them because they don\u2019t like this album anymore. They can't still like this album and release something as \u201cRoots\u201d. Their tastes seem to have changed (Sepultura lost track before the Cavaleras leaving), to the worst unfortunately. \n\nIf you liked Sepultura \u2018s Schizophrenia, well, Sepultura didn\u2019t really change in this album concerning their approach to thrash, just put out an even more perfected album.; different production, \u201cclearer\u201d and more violent, and some more awesome drumming without forgetting the riffs; all that in one punishing thrash metal album. You can actually hate this and like \u201cRoots\u201d and the likes, but you can\u2019t hate this and like Thrash!\n",
        "\nThe 1980s were the years in which were born some of heavy metal's most important genres, such as black, death and thrash metal.\n\nSepultura, today's most famous Brazilian metal band created in 1984 by the Cavalera brothers Max and Igor, is one of those few bands that have managed to participate as a pioneering band in such musical genres, as well as bringing key characteristics into those rapidly evolving subgenres of metal.\n\nSepultura's influences are hard to discern at first, though the clear mark of hardcore punk's speed and attitude is easily recognizable.\nThis influence has been constant, from the band's earliest cult blackened thrash/death metal releases to the these recent years whence Derric Green was brought in to substitute Max Cavalera's departure.\n\nThis rebellious sentiment of distaste directed towards modern society reaches it's peak in total synchronization with the band's final acquiring of musical technique and an impressive inspiration on Sepultura's 1989 full length release \u201cBeneath The Remains\u201d.\n\nThe record's first apparent lyrical theme is surely apocalypse through warfare, but it is through further interest in the song titles and lyrics that we learn that this apocalypse Max Cavalera bravely barks about is happening right now as we know it, through the degeneration of society into a game of survival based only on self-trust.\n\nThe first song \u201cBeneath The Remains\u201d perfectly portrays what to expect from this album.\nThe sorrowful acoustic intro (surely in reference to a pre-apocalyptic life) provides a moment to breathe, but this is only the calm before the storm.\nA brief moment of silence ensues in a sonic attack by a maddened and enraged riff, signalling the beginning of the end, the beginning of total degeneration.\n\nThe speed kicks in, speed that can be found everywhere on this album, and occasionally turns into a slower, groovier breakdown, that eventually leads to a frenetic bomb blast towards the end of each song. \nThis recipe works wonders on this album: used in addition to awesome, imaginative riffs and suffocating, brutal drumming, it creates a blueprint to thrash metal perfection.\n\nThe next song is \u201cInner Self\u201d, a slower (in comparison to other tracks on the album) heavy metal anthem with a melodic passage that was bound to become one of Sepultura's most famous songs (a video was made for this song).\n\nThen, the speed is quickly reinstaured with the following track \u201cStronger Hate\u201d, which can equally be considered as an anthem, with a good balance of slow passages and fast passages, as well a memorable chorus (\u201cstronger than hate!\u201d an all star vocal performance comprised of Kelly Shaefer (of Atheist), John Tardy (of Obituary), Scott Latour and Francis Howard (of Death/Thrash band Incubus) lively shouts).\n\nThe guitars on \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d hypnotically swoop in, and once more a fantastically enjoyable rush of speed that lasts all through the song punches in.\nThe three next songs \u201cSarcasting Existence\u201d, \u201cSlaves of Pain\u201d and \u201cLobotomy\u201d are musical compositions that work perfectly with their lyrical themes and are enjoyably progressive.\nThey are followed (in my regards) by the weakest track of the album, \u201cHungry\u201d which if left on it's own is still widely acceptable.\n\nThe album should finish with \u201cPrimitive Future\u201d, a breathtakingly fun and fast track, but on the remastered version the Brazilian masters of speed choose to give extra bang for the buck with two instrumentals for the tracks \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d and \u201cInner Self\u201d (get your karaoke machines!), and of course a hilariously good anglicized cover of Os Mutantes \u201cA Hora E A Vez Do Cabelo Nascer (The Moment and the Turn of Hair's Birth).\n\nThis album showcased the impressive musical potential Sepultura acquired over the years (before they unfortunately downgraded themselves with Chaos A.D and beyond) mixed with truly wonderful song and lyrical writing.\n\nThe addition of lead guitarist Andreas Kisser proved to be a significant strategic move, as his leads and solos bring the cutting edge the vocaless sections of the songs need.\n\nThe drumming is fantastically delivered by Igor Cavalera, who uses brutal speed or more groove inspired drumming at times: all in all his perfomance provides a dynamic feeling to the music.\nPaulo and Max do excellent jobs at what they do best, as Paulo's bass brings in the extra heaviness needed.\n\nMax Cavalera's barking vocals convey an image of a desperate man in an apocalyptic world who sees a glint of hope in this blackened, futureless world.\nHis vocals take on a significant change from their earlier releases, being more of a shout than a growl.\nThe lyrics vary from political and medical condamnation to a more punkish charged themes such as individuality.\n\nI consider this album as one of the highest peaks of thrash metal, as it perfects most of the genre's highlights, such as speed, technicality, great songwriting and quality riffing.\nAll in all, this album is nothing short of excellent and it is a must have album for a metalhead or anyone, really, regardless of genre preference.\n\nSadly, on later releases Sepultura sacrificed complex musical compositions for a more straightforward style of music( still maintaining a punkish attitude, but more dumbed down), which resulted in a good number of mediocre releases (such as \u201cRoots\u201d). \nThis is an album that will strike your heart with memorable tunes that will stick in your mind for weeks and will definetly make you want to headbang violently as well as turn you into a speed addict. A jaw-dropping release.\n",
        "\nLooking at the reviews of this album, I see a lot of hate for this album, with that dreaded word \"Mallcore\" being banded about a lot. What the hell is \"mallcore\"? From what I can see, it's one of the stupidest fucking genre names I have ever heard in my life. Seriously, what the fuck? Anything that Roadrunner seems to have put out IMMEDIATELY constitutes \"Mallcore\", so I suppose I'll add Deicide and Obituary to that list then? It seems to be that if your album wasn't out in 1986 and entitled \"Pleasure To Kill\", you'll probably be a \"mallcore\" band. Maybe if all you uber-metal-l33tists took your head out your arse or even your Sarcofago vinyl bootleg collection, you'd notice that it is one of the worst terms ever devised to describe something.\n\nBut I digress from my main goal, to review this album. \"Against\" was seen as the birth of a new age for Sepultura, eschewing in Derrick Green as a replacement for Max Cavalera, and instantly stepping into his shadow. However, it also saw a stylistic change for Sepultura yet again. Andreas Kisser had taken Sepultura in a more hardcore-styled direction, faster, shorter and to the point. It was a million miles from the proto-Black metal of Morbid Visions or the Death/Thrash of Arise and Beneath The Remains. It took the groove base of Chaos A.D. and fiddled with it, adding some Hardcore style stuff here and there, as well as bringing in the Tribal elements of Roots again, although with a more Oriental slant this time as well.\n\nThe result? Better than I expected anyway. I expected a below-par offering of the same songs recycled over and over again, but there is a great deal of variation, with the tribal bits adding a great deal of flair to the whole thing. Saying that, this is what you'd expect from a Derrick Green-era Seps album really. Against was the carving out of a niche style for Sepultura, this is where they made a statement and outlined what this new Sepultura was and the following albums built on this base. \n\nThe problem was that they never really capitalised on the promise of this album. By the time of Nation, most of the tribal elements had been scrapped, with only the odd flourish here and there. Not only this, but the individual performances here are some of their best. Especially Derrick Green's. Seriously, what the hell happened? Green's performance on this album is AMAZING. The Vocals are all over the place, Napalm Death style screeches, Downright EVIL growls and stellar clean vocals, although not the best ever, they fit perfectly and his dulcit, low evil voice is fucking fantastic nonethless. There's so much variation it's unbelievable, but by Nation it was all gone. He had found his comfort zone and was sticking to it, with a slightly monotone shouty voice (Which does appear on here as well quite a lot, but along with the variation works better) that begins to grate after a while. The vocals do not grate on this at all. I love them. One of the best performances I've heard on an album for a long time.\n\nIgor Cavalera's drumming is a benchmark on here and shows off his flair undoubtedly. He mixes the groove of Chaos A.D. with the blast of Arise/Beneath perfectly, as well as adding lots of Tribal beats and fills and bringing into reign the band and adding the sensibility of future albums. Paolo does a great job on bass, although is overshadowed a bit by the appearance of Jason Newsted here methinks. Andreas Kisser is fantastic, the riffs he peels off are excellent, and it's a long while before he starts having to mine deeper in his Sepultura riff bank to find anything good.\n\nThe songs themselves vary from not bad/average Seps to really fucking top class. The opening one-two of Against and Choke is inspired and you'll be wanting a breather after them! Luckily, Rumors give us this respite, being average and not very exciting at all. Next up, Old Earth provides one of the highlights of the album by far. One of the best Green-era Seps songs ever to be honest, I love it. Floaters In Mud I could live without to be honest, it's quite boring and that title is cringe-worthy. Is that the best title they could come up with? It makes me think of a blocked toilet pan every time I hear it!\n\nBoycott is a bit better but nothing to write home about really, enjoyable but not memorable. Tribus is an enjoyable instrumental which I thought was quite interesting (And an odd choice to be released as a single, which Sepultura did), but Common Bonds was your typical slower, groovy Seps song and quite disappointing, although the way it segues in from Tribus was fantastic I loved it. F.O.E. was interesting but forgettable.\n\nThen we come to Reza. An outstanding song, one of the best Sepultura have written and possibly the best of the Green era! Imagine the first 4 albums distillied into a strong hateful brew and then injected with 100% pure Napalm Death. This is bordering on Grind, honestly. I fucking love it, and I wish they'd play this live. Perhaps they should've got Joao Gordo to be pernament vocalist instead of Green!\n\nUnconscious is another filler song, and a good comedown from Reza. Kamaitachi is great, although not something you could whistle down the street. Having the Japanese percussive band KODO guest on this song is inspired although it feels like the Metal elements were added for the sake of it, out of more need than want. This could've been perfect if there was no actual Sepultura on it, oddly. Drowned Out is good but suffers like Unconscious and the rest before it, in that it's not very memorable. Hatred Aside however is VERY memorable. A collaboration with Jason Newsted (Definitely a collaboration, not a guest appearance, he has co-writing credits for both Music and Lyrics as well as singing and playing bass/guitar on the track). A great thrash tune, echoing Beneath The Remains and Arise, (Surprising when you consider Newsted's day job at the time was Load/Reload-era Metallica) this song SLAYS. After Reza, this is my favourite song on the album. \n\nThe album closes with T3rcermillenium, a Canyon Jam for Green-era Sepultura. It incorporates lots of odd tribal instruments and was, mostly, recorded in one take live. I think the whole \"one take\" thing is extremely interesting as is the tribal instruments and the general Jam nature of the song. I wish Sepultura would do an EP or something, consisting of songs and Jams like this or Kaiowas or even Jasco/Itsari, a \"mellowed out\" EP. Although nowhere near as good as Canyon Jam, Kaiowas or Itsari, it is a great song and a welcome addition.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a fantastic album, and I can't see where all the hate is coming from. The only thing I can think of is the fact that it's not Max and the stylistic change (This is so far removed from early Seps, it's unbelievable). The hate seems to come from fans who seem to believe that Sepultura should have just continued to churn out copies of Beneath The Remains/Arise up till the Modern day, but to be honest, Chaos A.D. and Roots are just as good and even a bit better than the 2 albums mentioned above and this new style is actually good, when you give it a chance.\n\nThe other problem is that, because of Sepultura having 6 consecutive masterpieces, this had a LOT to live up to. Before even singing a note, Derrick was already firmly in the shadow of Max. If this wasn't better than all 6 albums combined, he would be hounded, no matter how good it actually was. The split had also left a rift with the fans and 2 sides formed, the Max side (Heralding the birth of Soulfly) and the Seps side. \n\nIn the end, Max looks to have won out via record sales and tours and Green became overlooked, which is a shame, as Sepultura today are actually really good, on album and onstage. When I went to see them in 2006, they blew me away, but I know that a Soulfly/Cavalera Conspiracy show would've been better.\n\nBut regardless of the disadvantages, the only other problem is that it's the jack of all trades. You can't really think of anything that it's better than. It's nowhere near as good as any of \"the Max 6\". You can't even say it's better than it's arch-rival, the Soulfly debut, as I still hold that in a higher regard. In fact, you can't even say it's the best Green-era album, as Nation takes that title for me. Against is a bit non-descript, and I loved the whole \"nation concept\" of Nation as well as it still having a better set of songs, as well as the fact that Green actually got to write a bit more. I would be willing to bet that Kisser, as the main songwriter, had written most of this stuff with Igor before they even picked Green as the vocalist. Nation was written as a more consciencous effort from Cavalera, Kisser AND Green and flows much better.\nIt seems that this album will be always be seen as second best to everything else by the Cavaleras and Kisser, which is a shame.\n\nNow with the depature of Igor, and the subsequent setting up of the Cavalera Conspiracy, It seems that this Sepultura is consigned to the history books as a footnote. With the promise of a new album based around \"A Clockwork Orange\", it seems there is 2 ways for Sepultura to go. They can go down the route of Black Sabbath and descend into farce with a revolving cast of drummers and an underappreciating fanbase yearning for the days of old, as Kisser and co. churn out album after album, and tour after tour to a dwindling fanbase, or they could throw their fans a nostalgic bone and reunite the Max-era line-up, undermining and diminishing the 10 years of Derrick Green. Personally, I would be happy if they didn't reunite. Why? Because then we'd be getting Sepultura albums which are still quite good AS WELL as Cavalera Conspiracy albums and Soulfly albums. To be honest, if a Seps reunion means abolishing Soulfly and Cavalera Conspiracy, I'll say No thanks.\n\nWhat will actually happen though? Only time will tell.\n",
        "\nThis rare 5 track E.P. was an Australia only release which coincided with the band's tour of the aforementioned continent back in 1992 during what many would consider to be the band's \"classic\" era. It essentially contains the \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" single from the album \"Arise\" which the band was touring to promote at the time, a cover of the Dead Kennedys' \"Drug Me\" (from their classic \"Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables album\") which they did for a Dead Kennedys tribute compilation album \"Virus 100\", and 3 live tracks recorded in Barcelona, Spain in 1991. \n\nAlthough all the songs are very good, it's the live tracks that are the real highlight of the material. They are \"Inner Self\" from \"Beneath the Remains\" album, \"Troops of Doom\" from \"Morbid Visions\" and a terrific version of the Motorhead classic \"Orgasmatron\". The live tracks really shine through, arguably sounding more energetic and fresh than the original album versions. It must be noted that at the time of the E.P.'s release these track were very rare and hard to find, but have all been subsequently re-issued on other releases since. \n\nIn conclusion, this E.P. is a great addition to any Sepultura fan's collection and a great reminder of what a formidable force the band once was in the global metal scene in the early 90's. It captures what most would consider to be the band's \"classic\" line-up in their creative and unpretentious prime.\n",
        "\nAccording to the liner notes, Bestial Devastation was recorded in two days in another shitty Belo Horizonte studio. So how did this sound better than the LP? In all seriousness, this album is about the same as Morbid Visions except with better production, of course.\n\nThe production really made the drums sound vicious as hell, the guitar tone is particularly sweet, after all this is Brazil 1986. Back then nobody in Brazil knew how to produce metal (as evidenced by the LP). The vocals are very echo-y which makes it really weird. The bass...well I think it's there, I'm pretty sure I heard some bass runs now and then. As with my Morbid Visions review, Paulo's bass playing isn't that interesting but eh.\n\nThe songs are also the proto-Schizophrenia/Beneath the Remains-styled-songs the LP would show and a lot of the riffs are used again in the LP. The drums are really awkward in \"Antichrist\", Igor said he didn't use the bass drums (to be precise, he said he didn't use kicks) so it's strange. The demo version of \"Necromancer\" is also included and, again, has better production than Morbid Visions. What is wrong with the studio/engineers when they recorded Morbid Visions (according to the liner notes, they used different studios for the demo, the EP and the LP)? \"Anticop\" is hilarious, Max really brings it home every time he says \"Stick the gun/Up your ASS!!\" and \"FUCK THA POLICE!!\" but the drumming is way better than \"Antichrist\". I could really do without the \"scary-crap-from-hell\" intro, although the burp-growl is hilarious, especially when he says \"...Sathanas invoke to destroys!! Bestial Devastation!!!\"\n\nConclusion: Buy the re-release. It's worth it. This here is classic death/thrash all the way from Belo Horizonte. (In the liner pictures, the band wore makeup at one point that can be considered proto-corpsepaint. Probably Wagner's doing.)\n",
        "\n...So why do I like it!? Considering this was their formal debut (I consider LPs to be a band's true debut), it's very disappointing and underwhelming. When you consider their next album, Schizophrenia, you can hardly believe it's the same band. The biggest crime here would be the tinny guitar tone, c'mon guys! Bestial Devastations had a better tone! The guitars are particularly cringe-worthy when the solos come. Not that Jairo T., who doesn't look like a metalhead in the liner pictures, is a bad guitarist. It's just that the production makes his solos so squeaky and difficult to listen.\n\nThe other aspects are slightly better: The drums aren't horrible but very, very sloppy; The vocals have this weird effect put on it that makes it sound louder and echo-ish but not quite as much as reverb; The bass...well the bass is there. Poor Paulo, this and the EP before is the few albums where you can here him. Although his bass playing isn't too special.\n\nThe songs...well they're okay. Clearly these boys had much potential, the songs are like a rougher and rawer version of Schizophrenia or Beneath the Remains. But the songs, although headbang worthy, don't stand out very much. Oh sure there are interesting riffs in the songs and some solos that are above average, but it's not as strong as their future records. Even Igor admits (according to the re-releases liner liner notes) that they were ripping off the songs from their heroes, thus there ain't much depth to them. The only one that stands out is \"Troop(s) of Doom\" but it still suffers from the same obstacles from the others.\n\nAs you'd have guessed by now, I'm reviewing the re-release with Bestial Devastations. But since there's a separate page for it, I'll review it there.\n\nConclusion: This album is off-putting at first, what with the rawer-than-black-metal production and kids playing it fast and sloppy. But give it a couple of listens, then this album begins to grow on you. \n\nGet the re-release, you'll get more bang for your buck.\n",
        "\nWhat an EP! When I listened to it few years ago I was amazed, astonished and completely shocked. I bought it in Ireland with Morbid Visions together and if the full length already destroyed my ears, I had to face these five tracks five of pure necro death/thrash. In 1985 no one and I mean NO ONE could match such violence and putridity in the sound. Neither Kreator, nor Sodom or Hellhammer and Possessed. This is pure decomposition.\n\nThe Death\u2019s debut was quite far and Chuck picked up something from these songs, for sure. It has been said by Max that once they walked into the studio they were more or less 16 years old and in Brazil there were no good studios to record a metal album, and for sure no good ones to record death metal! Igor\u2019s drum kit was very essential and the amplifiers were too small but the sound they created is still a cult and, for sincerity and purity, it goes beyond any well produced album at the time in this genre (were there any??).\n\n\u201cThe Curse\u201d intro was made by a friend who was in the studio while they were recording and this is something hilarious in its obscurity and blasphemy. \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d shows simple riffage with a strange, dark distortion and various stop and go. The mid-paced parts are made by single notes and so, very simple and doom. The up tempo parts are more speed/thrash oriented but nasty and truly evil. Max's vocals are not completely thrash but more focused on death metal tonalities with a raw-Cronos touch.\n\nThe drums sound is very raw, especially the bass drum. With \u201cAntichrist\u201d I can easily scream for the pure pleasure. This is total rawness with no compromise semi blast beats! Unbelievable. The refrain has been made to be shouted to death. The vocals have something black metal too inside and the atmosphere is even more necro than in the previous songs, like also in the superb, simple but awesome \u201cNecromancer\u201d! The solos are a total mess\u2026in a mixture of shreds, whistles with hyper under produced sound\u2026simply great! \n\nThe beginning of \u201cEvil Warriors\u201d, with the rolls on the drums and the up tempo, already shows the stand out member in the line up: Igor. He would become really great in the future and for his age he\u2019s quite good here too. The song is more canonical thrash with the unfailing, rotten down tempo and even a better solo made of tapping parts! To finish, check out the great \u201cAnticop\u201d as bonus track. They changed the \u201cAntichrist\u201d lyrics to put some insults to the cops and the outcome is simply amazing: the drums are hyper triggered and the guitars are far more audible. \n\nOverall, this is a piece of primordial death metal history and a must for any old school metalhead. I like necro stuff!!\n",
        "\nSepultura is a hero to everyone playing in a third-world country 'cause they are the few bands that make it big, course they later sold out but they still deserve respect. This album being one reason and the next being the other. Also the broken English lyrics are hilarious at times.\n\nThe album opens with the pretty much standard \"scary crap from hell\" intro. Well actually they rip off the \"Psycho\" theme, you know the one where Bates kills the chick in the shower. But since the album is called \"Schizophrenia\" I guess it fits. Then somebody says something in a distorted voice before \"From the Past comes the Storms\" riff comes. My friend said it reminds him of \"Angel of Death\" but eh whatever. \n\nThe first thing you notice, even in the remaster, is the fact that they have shit production. Considering they are from Brazil and back then nobody knew how to produce thrash in Brazil, I guess it's okay. The guitar tone makes it hard to make out individual notes in the riffs and you can't hear the bass a lot. The drums however get the best treatment and it's still a benchmark on how drums are supposed to sound in thrash. Oh and the growled vox with the Brazilian accent also sound odd at times and even by growl standards it's kind of hard to make out the words.\n\nThe second thing you notice is the fact that the first song sings about, well nothing really. There's something about apes, giants, dwarves (what the fuck does a \"flight of dwarves/Strengthening the giants\" mean?), fruit and nature though. Ah well it's still excellent thrash. Oh and the solo is awesometastic(tm) as well.\n\nUp next, \"To the Wall\" a song about an execution. The riffs are damn fine yet again and the drums are damn brutal. So why did they go groove again? At least they had three thrash albums before they bought the farm. The song fades out, which is something I don't like 'cuz it ruins the experience unless it fades into something. Then out of nowhere, BAM! \"Escape to the Void\" comes in with a nice little solo before the thrash mania begins. Three songs in and nothing resembles Mr. Cavalera's future outputs. Seriously what went wrong?\n\nThen comes the legendary \"Inquisition Symphony\". It starts with some acoustic stuff then break out into riffmania! This is much better than most thrash instrumentals *cough*Orion*cough* 'cuz it's heavy on the riffs. Then \"Screams Behind the Shadows\" comes though it's not as memorable as the previous tracks. Then \"Septic Schizo\" which, I guess, is the title track. Another good song but not as memorable. The last song is \"R.I.P.\" or \"Rest in Pain\", well there is an instrumental before it, but it's more like a segue than a song. Good song yet again from the Boys from Brazil.\n\nThe re-release comes with \"Troops of Doom\", \"The Past Reborns the Storm\", which is an even more broken English laden \"From the Past comes the Storms\" though the production gives the guitars a wider space making you feel not as suffocated as the album cut, and rough demo tracks for \"Septic Schizo\" and \"To the Wall\" no solos or nothing, not even vox. The liner notes also detail the history of the record though not as much as the intro for the tab book. Neat pictures though.\n\nConclusion: essential thrash from Brazil, track down the re-release (well I had to, metal is fucking rare here.)\n",
        "\nWith the great Schizophrenia, Sepultura really learnt how to play their instruments in a good way and they started a new period, less death metal but more thrash/death. This period has a peak, and it\u2019s also the peak of their career in my opinion\u2026of course we are talking about the fucking great Beneath The Remains. The brutality of this group is mixed perfectly with a good technique and an excellent songwriting. The sound by the instruments is sharper, thrasher and less Venom worshipper, showing a personality that has always been a bit hidden in their previous albums.\n\nThis time the production is far better than the previous albums, but very old fashioned, especially for the drums. Everything sounds so raw but clean and powerful without the pounding production of the following Arise album. Beneath The Remains contains some of the best songs ever recorded by those guys and it\u2019s a classic in its genre.\n\nStarting from the title track, after a small acoustic guitar intro, all that we have is a bunch of riffs, the sick Max's vocals and the restless Igor\u2019s drumming. The following \u201cInner Self\u201d is a great mid-paced song, that contrary to those in Arise, doesn\u2019t show signs of modernism or something like this. This is pure thrash/death orgy with hundreds of palm muting riffs, stop and go and speed restarts.\n\nKisser is growing album after album in its way of playing the lead guitars and every song has some of the best solos ever by this group. For example check the magnificent, superb one in the awesome \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d: pure hellish madness. It's so sick and obscure. \u201cStronger Than Hate\u201d is total death in the guitars with great obscure lead lines and the great work by Igor, especially at the double kicks.\n\nThe drums intro to \u201cSarcastic Existence\u201d shows no mercy and begins a long series of great fucking songs\u2026each and every one contains catchy riffs and some obscure lead sounds to create a truly hellish atmosphere. Max continues in vomiting all his hate towards the world while the tempo is getting faster and faster.\n\n\u201cSlaves Of Pain\u201d is great with the refrain \u201c\u2026Life Ends\u2026Feeling Death! Slaves Of Pain!\u201d and the great thrash rhythmic guitar riffage. \u201cLobotomy\u201d is lethal with the drums intro: Igor is faster than ever. The two final songs \u201cHungry\u201d and \u201cSlaves Of Pain\u201d don\u2019t slow down at all, continuing the up tempo parts \u2018till reaching the end by an echoing stomp on the last drum beat. All that remains is satisfaction for such a brutal effort.\n\nThese ones are some of the best compositions ever by the Brazilian group and this masterpiece enters, rightly, in the Hall Of Fame of this genre.\n",
        "\nYes, Sepultura can still thrash with the best of them. They proved it here on their all-covers album Revolusongs with their perfect, dare I say it, better than the original rendition of Exodus' \"Piranha\". Listening to this track makes me imagine Beneath the Remains-era Sepultura being transported to the modern day setting. The uncredited track 8 teased me some more as the faint opening strains of Metallica\u2019s \"Enter Sandman\" soon morphed into the wicked thrash riff of \"Fight Fire With Fire\" before it faded and left me shaking my head in dismay on what could've been had the Seps' completed the track. They can still thrash...if they wanted to. The skill is there but they lack the willingness so it seems.\n\nBut alas, that's just the last two songs on the CD. There's still the other tracks to discuss. \"Messiah\", a Hellhammer cover, open things up and starts this album up on a positive note with its heavy handed riffing and powerful drum beats. At first I didn't even recognize that it was Derrick Green doing vocals on this track. For a second, I thought Max had done guest vocals. From the headbanging beginning, the mood immediately tapers off on track two with their cover of Massive Attack's \"Angel\". While obviously heavier and given the 'Sepultura treatment', it's a dragging and unexciting song. Public Enemy's \"Black Steel...\" witnesses the Sep's foray into rap metal - and that can't be good right? Right. \n\nThe mood shifts positively on the next track which is a cover of Devo's \"Monggoloid\", an upbeat track that kicks into hardcore high-gear as it closes. \"Mountain Song\", a Janes' Addiction original, works well as it sounds like a heavy alternative rock track with ringing guitars that don't try to sound metal. I consider myself a U2 fan and despite this, I have never liked \"Bullet the Blue Sky\". Thus, Sepultura's cover of this song didn't work for me as they didn't add anything new to it. They just made a boring rock song a heavier but still boring song. The last track is the true highlight of this entire album and I already discussed it at the start of this review so there's no need to reiterate. \n\nSo is this album worth your money? Probably not. You can easily download Sepultura's cover of \"Piranha\" somewhere in the wide world web. But I got this cheap and by accident so if by chance you'll be put in a similar situation and you're not starving for food - don't hesitate to pick this up.\n",
        "\nSince 'Roots' and the departure of Max Cavalera this band has gone from strength to strength on each release; from having no good songs, to having one, then two and now arriving at a release that has a staggering four decent songs. I tip my hat to you, Sepultura, unfortunately the rest of the album is drivel; boring and uncreative groove metal mixed with large doses of half-cocked hardcore aggression. I can understand the natural progression from their tribal nu-metal chimera back into their Chaos AD groove, but I can't see why Andreas Kisser can't emulate his previously ball-busting style he wowed us with back on releases such as 'Arise' and 'Beneath the Remains'. I feel the pangs of guilt as a fall back on the tried and true method of slagging off a band for not being what they once were; the times are a changin' as they say, but damnit, some things just shouldn't give in so easily. \n\nSepultura are doing their best to find a new sound, and I suppose they're getting better but these growing pains are lasting an awfully long time, there is a sense of apathy in their gradual steps forward; simply giving up because people won't think the same way about them without the return of Max, which is bollocks to be quite fair. More likely than not, people want his return to be triumphant to forgive him for past transgressions, however gauging his musical creativity and aptitude by his latest work in Cavalera Conspiracy, one should not be too optimistic at any sign of his return nor at the prosect of future Soulfly releases. Irrelevancy and wank aside, this current band incarnation is of its own and its fruition is nigh, or so I hope.\n\nThe improvements from 'Roorback' into 'Dante XXI' are quite obvious; the riffage is strong and fast in a lot of places and when it slows down it's still somewhat effective although it suffers heavily from the lack of innovation and the atavistic sense of sticking to banal groove-based power chording restricted to a single area. Drums are a top-notch affair although the snare drum production is a bit obnoxious in places, but I suppose that the guitar tone could be blamed for not being heavy enough to overpower said snare drum. The solos have made something of a stronger comeback but they aren't particularly virtuosity is questionable, for now they are merely good and serve the purpose of being a solo; nothing more, nothing less.\n\nOf course song writing is where it's these days, and apparently this album takes heavily from the concepts espoused by Dante as referring the circles of hell, purgatory and all that afterlife nonsense. To be quite honest, barring song titles such as \"The City of Dis\" and \"Ostia\", the song lyrics never really struck me as pertaining to a set pacing and their allusions to the book are shallow at best. The average pillock's knowledge of the book in question is regurgitated and then swirled amongst personal beliefs and social commentary, it's bearable but I would not be recommend that you bust your balls reading the liner notes and lyrics as you listen to this album. Derrick's barking vocals make the lyrics very incoherent but who cares, besides he's quite effective as a loudmouthed counterpoint to the groove. The song structures themselves are set in stone, and deviation or aberrations do not occur very freely except within the filler tracks that utterly superfluous in every sense of the word and its synonyms too. Intro - riff - chorus - riff - bridge - solo or weird melodic bit - riff - finish; it does not get any more complex than that, not to say that Sepultura were ever a hugely complex band back in their heyday but they had somewhere in the region of e to the power of nine thousand riffs to draw attention from their awkwardly written lyrics and lack of variance.\n\nTherein lies the problem with this release however; as it has been said quite a few times now, it is definitely an improvement and helps to establish the trend that Sepultura are moving forward even if it is at something of a haggard and drunken pace, but despite these improvements the band lacks the riffing power that was ever present in their earlier works whilst backed up by a decent rhythm section and with one or two shredding solos. The riffs can be fast but there's maybe five styles to the riffing, and when they're slow they drag the songs down the pits of mediocrity and conjure images of the more forgettable songs on 'Chaos AD'. The solos allude to any sense of purpose when they attempt something melodic or potentially tribal-esque. The songs blend together and their distinguishing features are usual banal moments such as choruses or slightly different riffing in juxtaposition to a drum fill. Most unusual in this cavalcade of groove is the final song however; 'Still Flame' which seems to be conjuring up their tenuous tribal links from the past, this song is just disappointing through and through, and only cements the opinion that Sepultura have this masochistic desire to hold onto musical style that never meshed effectively with their music and was popular if only for the drop-D and the gimmick nature of the entire thing. Sepultura is a band that I sympathise with heavily, and whilst this album certainly displays a few promising moments, no matter how simplistic and suspect they may be, there is always the future but it will only be successful if they turn their backs on the past.\n",
        "\nThis is the last death/thrash metal album by Sepultura and still one of my favourite ones in this genre. The mature side of the group already arose in the awesome Beneath The Remains and here we have a natural follow up with some new elements. The production is one of the cleanest, if not the cleanest one in their discography and all the instruments have a brutality load from it. \n\nIf the title track shows no mercy in pure death/thrash style, going on we can have some gloomy sounds created by keyboards or I don\u2019t know from what but the main thing is this: never before they used such atmospheres between songs and I love it. Some riffs too are more oriented in what would have been Chaos A.D. but surely more violent, for example in \u201cDead Embryonic Cells\u201d where the mid-paced parts are full of weird solo parts. The up tempo parts are clear-cut and devastating. \n\n\u201cDesperate Cry\u201d is incredibly gloom during the arpeggios part to end in a long mid-paced section. The drums work by Igor is always devastating and the crunchy guitar riffage here is more focused on the catchiness of the pattern than on the pure violence. I love the fast bass drum final with great Max's screams. The very first tribal influences come with \u201cSubtraction\u201d but just at the beginning, with great tempo changes and awesome refrain. We can find them again, in bigger quantity this time, with \u201cAltered State\u201d: the song that shows a completely different approach with odd guitar lines and mid-paced parts with doom vocals.\n\n\u201cUnder Siege\u201d is true gloom in the guitars, always well balanced between arpeggios-lead and violent palm muting parts. The use of some filtrated, whispered vocals makes this song even stranger and ritualistic. \u201cMeaningless Movements\u201d really gives you the idea of the title with schizophrenic/catchy riffs, always in semi up tempo at maximum, with the arrival of the up tempo at the end. With the final \u201cInfected Voice\u201d we go back to 1989 for the vicious attack and the fantastic solos. Killer song. \n\nAll in all, this is a fucking great album to me, with awesome songs that now are more focused on the catchy side than on the pure violence with a production that is finally adapt to this genre. Anyway an album that already showed us how would have been the band\u2019s future.\n",
        "\nWhat can we say that hasn\u2019t been already said for this great debut (in full length if we don\u2019t consider the Bestial Devastation EP) by one of the most representative bands in thrash/death metal during the 80s? Every fan of this music not only should, but MUST, know this one like every album by Sepultura \u2018till 1991 or, if you want, \u2018till 1993 (it\u2019s my case). This is one of the most influential blackened death/thrash release ever! \n\nTeenagers who wanted to play Sodom/Kreator/Venom style, created an album to remember for the ferocious, vicious sound. The most thrash metal influences of their first EP were brutalized by a high dose of early black/death metal to create legendary tracks like \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d or the great \u201cShow Me The Wrath\u201d. Max's vocals are on the borderline between screams and suffered growls, the drumming by Igor is fast as hell with brutal, primordial up tempo parts. \n\n\u201cMayhem\u201d are total vocals madness: fast as hell in pure Reign In Blood style while the guitar parts are always easy but catchy and total impact. The solos are quite messy and very raw with tremolos and whistles. \u201cTroops Of Doom\u201d is the track that made history here because it would have been done again in the future and it\u2019s the one that shows a quite more \u201cmature\u201d structure. \u201cCrucifixion\u201d has to be mentioned for the sick guitar lines and the Latin spoken part in the middle. Desecrating and blasphemous. \n\nThis album isn\u2019t technical, isn\u2019t melodic but it\u2019s just fast as hell, brutal as fuck and a truly heavy influence for the future generation of deathsters. Evil, rotten, blasphemous\u2026a fist in the stomach and a lesson of history. Almost everything started here for the extreme metal movements.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard this album I was speechless. The half-assed Pantera clone I had heard on Chaos A.D., had been a really talented thrash band at one point. Thats right, no grooves, no hardcore punk inspired riffs, just pure fucking thrash metal. It was this album that made me take a second look at Pantera, later Sepultura ,and realize it for what it was, pure crap. I had never heard something with such a concentrated use of aggression before in my life. It would be this album that would open the door's into the vast world of underground thrash for me, and ultimately make me ditch the glam pussies attempting to be tough act from texas. Sepultura was at the top of their game here, and it shows from beginning to end. \n\nWell I suppose I have to review the songs. The album starts off with \"Beneath the Remains\" which is a nice opener that catches even the most polished thrash/death listeners unaware. Basically this song is the epitome of what Sepultura could do right, and it was done with style. \"Inner Self' is more mid paced, but features a slew of catchy riffs. \"Stronger Than Hate\" is built to stomp your face into the ground with its vast array of heavy riffs, speed sections, and pounding drums. \"Mass Hypnosis\" has a retarded vocal track, but Sepultura never really was about the vocals. The song kicks it into true high gear for the first time on the album. \"Sarcastic Existence\", \"Slaves of Pain\" and \"Lobotomy\" all meld together really well. Slaves of Pain does it a little better with its use of a very sudden but important tempo change. \"Hungry\" is the worst track here, and its still worth listening too if I'm on a Sepultura run. \"Primitive Future\" contains an innovative song structure and a slew of riffs, it is guaranteed to destroy anyone in its path.\n\nThe best tracks here are \"Beneath the Remains\", \"Slaves of Pain\", and \"Lobotomy\". Yet every track here contributes in some way to the album. The production is basically flawless, heavy, yet not overproduced and a very interesting guitar tone. Yes this is Scott Burns crowning production achievement. The vocal tracks are audible, and not turned too high (Like in their groove years), and almost every riff seems to serve a purpose. \n\nThe album contains a slew of riffs, featuring 15-20 per song, as well as well constructed guitar lines, solo's, and even at times well written lyrics. Even more interesting is the way the vocal tracks are kind of used as another instrument to counter-act the flow of the currently playing riff. All in all, this album was hardly a new thing at the time. Good death/thrash had been around a while, but Sepultura re-wrote the entire rule book on how to make a death/thrash release. This album would pave the way for aggressive thrash bands, and even influences bands to this day (Warbringer). \n\nAny fan of thrash should get this album. Anyone looking for something heavier then Slayer or any of the big four should get this album. I reccomend this to anyone who is interested in thrash, and wants to re-live the days when Sepultura was actually good and not a bunch of proto-mallcore based grooves on cd. \n\n\"Who has won?... Who has died?... BENEATH THE REMAINS!!!\"\n",
        "\nWhen Blood-Rooted was released, Max Cavalera had already left the band.\nIt came out in a time when Sepultura fans were unsure about the future of the band and this was believed to be their latest release ever. Obviously, Roadrunner was more then eager to release it as it could be their last chance to make money out of Sepultura. There was a lot of protest from Max, mainly because he would not receive any money this compilation would generate. Since most of the songs were written by him, most people would consider it normal that the other band members would give a share. They didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt, and thus the relationship between Max and the other members plummeted even further. As you have figured out by now, this compilation album has a history to it, not just something they released because they wanted to buy a new house (so to speak). Because of this, and simply because it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds an awesome album, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a must have for all fans of Sepultura.\n\nWhen I first heard Blood-Rooted, I couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt believe it had only cost me \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd9. The first song is an awesome cover of Celtic Frost\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdProcreation of the Wicked\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. I actually think this cover is better than the original song, mainly because Cavalera\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds vocals make this song more pleasant to listen to. Then again I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not that big a fan of Celtic Frost, so this is only a subjective conclusion. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdInhuman Nature\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd is a cover of hardcore punk band Final Conflict. I have never heard them, but I can tell you that this song could easily be a track for Chaos AD. Andreas\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd guitar sound awesome on this track, with a nice solo and an amazing overall tone. Maybe they could have released this track as a bonus for Chaos AD. Next song is \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdPolicia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. They played this cover a lot, and Max still does occasionally with Soulfly. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a great moshing track, though I like the live version a lot more. Fans of hardcore punk will surely enjoy it. \n\nThree more covers follow, most notably of Black Sabbath (Symptom of the Universe) and Bob Marley (War). They are decent, but I like the original versions more. Next is a collaboration with avant-garde legend Mike Patton, called \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMine\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. As you would expect of anything that Patton is involved with, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds weird. Fans of the guy will surely want the song for their collection. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt really like it that much, as it ventures into the realms of nu metal at some moments. For some reason it reminds me of the Soulfly song \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdJumpdafuckup\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. But if you like Patton (like me), it's still an interesting listen.\n\nA couple of demos and remixes, as well as a Dead Kennedy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds cover (Drug Me) follow. They\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre not that interesting to me, although it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nice to hear the original version of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRoots Bloody Roots\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdLookaway\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd was remixed by Master Vibe (don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt ask ..). I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt mind remixes of songs, but this one is just plain bad. You can skip this song without missing out on anything.\n\nThe second part of the cd is something every Sepultura fan should hear. Seven live tracks performed at the peak of the Brazilian band\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds fame. Sure, some people might state that Chaos AD was a sellout album, but I still like it. Almost all of the songs are from Chaos AD, with only \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBeneath The Remains/Escape to the Void\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd reminding of Sepultura\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds pure thrash era. Overall these are awesome performances, as you could expect from this legendary band. Max makes himself look like an idiot, though, between some songs. I think he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a great musician, but maybe saying \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfuck\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd a lot less while playing live would earn him even more respect. I quote: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThis next song, goes out to the fucking, some stupid assholes in the press, or people that are fucking, they don't have the balls to say stuff into our face, but they do in our fucking back [...]\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Yeah, Cavalera is a great guy, but sometimes nobody knows what the hell he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds talking about. Oh well. \n\nSo, if you like Chaos AD-era Sepultura, get this thing! If you only like their pure thrash stuff, you should probably first give it a listen before buying, but I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm sure a lot of you people will enjoy it as well. The live tracks are amazing, and most of the covers are memorable too. Perhaps the remix was superfluous, but I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm sure some people might like it. With over one hour of material, Blood-Rooted is probably one of the best compilation albums ever.\n",
        "\nI'm not going to try to break this album up too much in this review, and it will stay fairly simple. As stated above, every minute of this album just feels like one massive riff, and it's a damn good one. Every song melts into the next one, and sometimes it feels like there's no end to the last one or a beginning to the next, which works very well on this record. Max Cavalera and Andreas Kisser are Thrash riff-masters to be revered. It's hard to hate a guy that \"likes to write riffs on the big string.\" \n\nEvery song on this album has a very hard-driving rhythm to it, and makes you wanna bang your head with regularity. To add to this, in every single song on this album, there's at least one riff that changes the pace notably, be it faster or slower (but always heavier) that gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. That isn't to say that the lead work done by Kisser here isn't superb, because filling in between these amazing riffs that are found behind every vocal and beyond is some very impressive stuff. \n\nThe downside is that this is the first album showing the new direction that Sepultura would be heading towards (listen to \"Altered State\" to hear a tribal Roots type sound). Upon multiple listens (which should be mandatory in our public schools) this album separates itself a little more song by song than anything they did previously. The variations suit it nicely, which I would say nominates it for best Sepultura record. The more refined and cleaner sound in a way makes them more accessible, but every song is still manufactured by the riff machine that is Cavalera/Kisser. They would never reach these heights again unfortunately, as the experimentation from here on out was never to the advantage of the music in my opinion. With Arise there's no wasted space, there's a reason for everything.\n",
        "\nThe unprecedented extremity of 'Reign in Blood' sounded the death knell for 80's thrash, but the pummelling perfection of 'Beneath the Remains' delivered the decisive blow. Sepultura accidentally broke a few extreme metal boundaries with 'Bestial Devastation', then showed that they could actually play their instruments with the promising yet ultimately transitional 'Schizophrenia'. Newly signed to Roadrunner and supporting Sodom on their European tour, Sepultura exploded out of Brazil with ruthless intent and showed the rest of the world just how good they were.\n\nOn the surface this is a tweak of their previous album, not an overhaul. Where 'Schizophrenia' was meandering and messy, 'Beneath the Remains' is tight, lean and relentless. The inexorable, driving thrash rhythms now twisted and turned with merciless precision and purpose. Igor Cavalera's powerful, dynamic, forceful performance established him as one of the best metal drummers. Andreas Kisser proves himself as one of the genre's greatest lead guitarists with relatively simple leads that emphasise harmony without resorting to mindless shredding. The last solo on 'Mass Hypnosis' is the best example; one of the best metal solos ever.\n\nScott Burns achieves his best production job here. This band's hunger and forcefulness slices through the murk, but creates an immense, brooding atmosphere of South American darkness in the process. It fully captures their brutal punk roots that were largely absent from their next album. Still, it is the songs that make this so essential. Side A is full of catchy, immediately recognisable 'hits' such as the immense 'Inner Self'. Side B has a stripped down, sharper thrash attack culminating in the flat-out speed of 'Primitive Future'. It is brilliant from start to finish. If Sepultura were to become one of the biggest metal bands in the world, then 'Beneath the Remains' is the reason why.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to say that even if they were immature and they did a quite death/thrash mess, I like the first two Sepultura efforts a lot. With \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d and \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d, Sepultura were still very raw and not great musicians; but with this great album, \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d, they finally proved that their immature approach to the music was definitely over.\n\nThis album is terrific! This is a total riffs assault! On this new album they also changed a bit their music that now is less death metal in the production and in the guitars sound. Their distortion is thrashier, but a bit down tuned, just to give something more extreme to the sound.\nSince the first two albums I've always liked Igor\u2019s way of playing drums a lot, but with this album he definitely improved his technique and speed. Here the drumming is surely more various and inspired.\n\nWe must say that there has been a change of guitarist too. Yes, the new lead guitarist is the great Andreas Kisser that replaced Jairo T. The newcomer is surely a better musician than the former one, giving a new inspiration and variety to their sound, than now is more complex and, at the same time, always brutal.\nHis solos are very fast, but able to create a good \u201cmelody\u201d that can be remembered. The Jairo T. ones were just noisy and senseless.\n\nLike I said before, this assault is based on true fucking heavy guitar riffs, while Max\u2019s vocals are still very raw but not so brutal and exaggerated like in the past. \nThis album contains all the Sepultura\u2019s classics, like the great Escape To The Void, where a mayhem intro of drums and guitar ends into a big thrash riff. The refrain is so fast, and the guitars always change tempo. Mid-paced riffs, fast parts, raw, schizophrenic solos and a big dose of thrash/death metal. \n\nAnother classic is To The Wall, where the lyrics were written by another good Brazilian metal band, Chackal. This song, at the beginning is quite mid paced, but after a death metal riff takes dominion, followed by the screamed, desperate and angry voice of Max. The drums here are incredible, alternating fast parts to other slower ones\u2026just incredible. The solos here follow the rhythmic guitar lines, to create a disturbing melody. The violence in the music and in the lyrics of this song is incredible\u2026TO THE WAAAALLLLL\u2026.AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!\n\nInquisition Symphony is an acoustic song, of about 7 minutes\u2026incredible for a band that just one year ago didn\u2019t seem to play an instrument as it was meant to be! Here the thrash riffs are amazing, among an infernal mix of different tempo parts and various disturbing guitar melodies. Schizophrenic!!\nThe Final song R.I.P (Rest In Pain), a part from being a masterpiece, ends in an incredible way: the drums and the guitars play a circus melody that actualy is very funny and reaches the top after, when a mess of screams and distorted instruments puts an end to this masterpiece.\n\nThe whole album is an incredible masterpiece of riffs and it's difficult to mark out the best songs. I cannot say that. At the time, I guess that nobody expected an album like this by Sepultura after their early works\u2026simply a schizophrenic pleasure for my hears.\n",
        "\nChaos A.D. is the fifth Sepultura\u2019s full length and it can be considered very innovative looking back the other releases before it. I was 14 years old when I listened first to this one, I loved it and I still love it now. Comparing this album with the others, it is totally different. This album starts the Sepultura groove period that continued with the following, boring and too tribal influenced Roots.\nThe music here is heavily influenced by Discharge but it can be considered a big mix of hardcore, thrash, tribal music and death metal. Well, the true death metal has a bit (a lot) gone away but some influences can be found in some riffs spread in the album.\n\nThe tribal influences started with Arise album where were used only for the intros, but here we have the explosion of these ones, like in Kaiowas song, completely tribal. In this one there are no electric guitar sounds or raw vocals. Just bongos and acoustic guitars. The atmosphere on this song is strange, in some parts is ritualistic\u2026like early brazilian music, made by the natives\u2026.in this case we can really see what would have been the group's style in the future. \n\nThe first three songs of the album, Refuse/Resist, Territory and Slave New World are the most famous. From the first two ones they took videos concerning the never ending wars in the Middle East. As you can see, also the lyrics have completely changed since their past albums. These lyrics are typical of the hardcore genre; so forget the inner struggles and violence that were a trademark of the group in the past. Biotech Is Godzilla is the fastest song of this album, but not so death metal\u2026massive hardcore influences in the riffs, while Max Cavalera\u2019s way of singing is less growly.\n\nWe Who Are Not As Others song is the slowest one, very dark, with strange voices and the refrain sung endlessly. Strange and obscure. \nDistortions, noises, loud guitars whistles, obscurity and a lot of differences from the early Sepultura\u2019s albums: this is Chaos A.D.\nWith this album, Sepultura proved to everybody they didn\u2019t want to be stuck in a genre forever, trying to change and accept various influences also from their mother country. The problem is that after this one, the group wanted to go beyond with the next album, losing lots of old fans.\n\nIn my opinion this is the last great Sepultura\u2019s album but I have to warn you, because you must forget about the true death metal, so well done by the group in the past. Innovative but extremely good!!\n",
        "\nThe Roots of Sepultura (TRS) is a comprehensive collection of rarities, demos, covers and live recordings. The high standard of quality material from start to finish, even on the demos, is a testament to what a truly great band Sepultura have been. The material spans from pre-Bestial Devastation up to Chaos A.D. (CAD), while three quarters of it is from the Arise era. The inclusion of some of the tracks, such as the Arise original mixes, my seem unnecessary but none of it is bad. Each track varies in significance but it's all good to have even if it's for completion sake or curiosity. An added bonus is the extensive notes in the booklet detailing the history of each song.\n\nIt all begins with three tracks left over from the Arise recording sessions. Intro is an instrumental with a good buildup and some catchy riffs despite it's very short length. Criminals In Uniform is mid-paced and more simple than anything from Arise making it sound more like something from Beneath the Remains. A great song but it's easy to hear why it was left off the album. The lyrics were written by the editor at the time of Metal Maniacs, Katherine Ludwig who was known for banning bands from the magazine whom she didn't agree with. It's strange that Sepultura would collaborate with someone who actively participated in censorship. The third is a cover of Mot\u00f6rhead's Orgasmatron, a song so bad (though lyrically excellent) it sticks out of their discography worse than Lemmy's moles. Sepultura play it the way it should have been, powerful and epic with no effects, making it the best cover they have ever done.\n\nThe four tracks from the original mix of Arise do not differ much from the final versions. The guitar sound here is slightly more aggressive and the snare has a big 80s sound to it, similar to Death's Leprosy album. The differences here are so minor the casual listener wouldn't even notice them without hearing the songs back to back. The only major change is Dead Embryonic Cells does not have it's industrial intro here.\n\nThe pre-production demos are included for their historical value. Necromancer is Sepultura's first recording, making it the most important track on TRS. The Past Reborns the Storms (From the Past Comes the Storms) is Andreas Kisser's first recording with the band. As evidenced by the original title, their English skills were both a blessing and a curse. Often it made for great lyrics and sometimes they made no sense. Each song is highly spirited and raw enough to make any black metal band envious.\n\nNext are cover songs of Mutantes, Dead Kennedys and Ratos De Por\u00e3o. All three are short, up-beat and aggressive showing off their punk influences. I've never heard any of the originals to compare them, but Sepultura are one of the few bands who not only do justice to the songs they cover, but usually greatly improve them. I don't think anyone will be disappointed.\n\n\"So, we try to wake you up playing something really old and really fast. It used to be called Antichrist. We change the lyrics. We have some fucking problems with the police. Now it's called Anticop. Fuck the police!\" This one song recorded live on the CAD tour is the only weak link on TRS due to sound quality. It's dominated by vocals and overly triggered bass drums. The rest of the drums and guitars are in the background.\n\nIt comes to an end with seven of the eleven tracks from the Under Siege home video, recorded live in Barcelona, Spain during the Arise tour. Even live Sepultura prove themselves to be one of the all time greats. They put on a tight performance, highly aggressive, sometimes rivaling the original songs. Andreas' solos are impressively accurate too. Total professionals. The sound is excellent, approaching studio quality. Even the crowd is highly energetic, chanting and singing on cue. I only wish the whole concert was included. The way Roadrunner has leached off Sepultura's past, it may be released in whole yet. Under a Pale Grey Sky does not compare to this at all. (The home video is also highly recommended. A staple of the 90s underground. Now available on Chaos DVD.)\n\nThe one problem I have is the way this was sold. About six months after purchasing Roots, TRS was released together as a double disc. Forcing me to purchase Roots again to obtain TRS at an even higher price than before. This was not a very fan-friendly thing to do. TRS should have had a proper release by itself like Blood-Rooted. It would have made even more sense to combine those two albums as a double CD.\n\nThis is the best release of it's kind since Anthrax's Attack of the Killer B's. Essential for anyone who enjoyed Arise or is a fan of the Max Cavalera years.\n",
        "\nPretty brutal thrash to be found here, not brutal as the teutonic bands, but still quite brutal. Aside the first 50 seconds of this album,there is a never ending riff assault which will make you bang like a real bastard, but if you'll sit back and read the lyrics, you'll discover a different aspect of this album.\n\nThe main themes on 'Beneath The Remains' are about war, hate,and political issues. The lyrics fits pretty well the riffing and when you concentrate on them you'll see that 'Sepultura' have some more talent with lyrics than most of the \"death, satan, hell\" bands. The vocals are also pretty good. They are quite agressive but still remains clean, not melodic but has some great heat within.\n\nThe opening track has a bit negligible intro for me. It sounds a lot like 'Call Of Cthulhu' ('Metallica'), pretty calm and clean pluckings with some echos surrounds it. Then it just explsodes into heavy and yet catchy riffing which could be a great straightforward intro for this album, instead a dull and long quiet passage which doesn't really gets to anywhere. 'Inner Self' has a nice main riff and pretty good drums fills, the lead guitar also sounds well and the chorus is a bit faster and excellent for moshing. The C-Part is pretty intense and combines a distorted and clean guitars flawlessly. Pretty sweeping track, also my favorite of this album.\n\nI must mention that this album is produced pretty well. The guitar has a solid feeling and it sounds pretty clear and heavy, the drums are also very dominant and the bass is pretty noticeable. All the instruments together sounds amazing and powerful and gives within the songs a pretty heavy vibe.\n\nEach song has a great riffs and it's own mettle which makes it sound unique in this album. The riffing isn't very technical, it's pretty simple but remains heavy and agressive for the whole album, and has some catchy moments here and there. No bad moments at all, there are good tracks and even better tracks.\n\nIn conclusion: this is one of the highlights from Sepultura's discography. Very enjoyable album, flows great and doesn't becomes boring at any point. Pretty essential for thrashers and closes the 80's thrash scene greatly. Get it if you look for a powerful thrash piece.\n\nHighlights: 'Inner Self', 'Stronger Than Hate', 'Mass Hypnosis', 'Slave of Pain' and 'Primitive Future'.\n",
        "\nYou know what the really funny thing is. When someone just doesn\u2019t like a transitional album, frantic fans will always use the same argument: \u201cYou would have liked it if you were \u2018open minded\u2019 \u201d. The 1996 album \u2018Roots\u2019 is a classic example of an album that devides us all and a lot had been said on here already. I for one hope to have an opinion that is slighty different.\n\nThe album of course has gone down in history as the most important album to mix Brazilian music with metal. So far I really like the idea. Nothing wrong with those great rhythms and what a marvellous thought to introduce these into the metalscene. I\u2019m always up for some really new ideas or innitialy crazy approaches. A lot of songs on this album are pretty good and do a good job of blending these styles. The titletrack is amazingly powerful and so was its video. More powerful actually than their previous album in terms of aggression and intensity. In essence it is a midtempo metal song with additional Brazilian elements. Second really superb song is \u2018Ratamahatta\u2019. The blend is perfect here since neither one of the styles takes the upper hand and the lead mixed vocals are simply great. \n\nThird place really goes to 'Born Stubborn' which is heavy, catchy and even danceable! great rhythms here and quite some happy riffs. Once again this is a song in which both styles blend perfectly. Fourth place will definately be 'Dusted' which is the missling link between the average sound of this album and its predecessor 'Chaos A.D.' with the emphasis on the latter. \n\nAlso worth mentioning is my personal fifth place 'Spit' which is actually a midpaced punksong reminiscent of Amebix and the slower works of Discharge. Okay, so there also was a short uptempo song for all those fans who had liked \u2018Biotech is Godzilla\u2019 and all the punk-covers Sepultura had recorded throughout the years but \u2018Dictatorshit\u2019 was no old thrasher yet still an entertaining song.\n\nBut really, how much I tried, all the other songs didn't really do it for me. not even 'Jasco' and 'Istari' because one \u2018Kaiowas\u2019 is enough for me and a chanting village doesn't change the fact that these acoustic intermezzos of Cavalera and Kisser all sound the same. Most of the other songs are midpaced and slowpaced nu-metal with incidental use of extra instruments like Berimbau on intros and in middlesections. Not really a blending of the styles you see but more of a contrived copy/paste approach compositionally. Real low points are \u2018Attitued\u2019 and \u2018Lookaway\u2019. The songs in essence are simply bad, boring, dull and the use of extra instruments doesn\u2019t change that. \n\nStill, after 11 years the album has some material that I wouldn't want to miss in my collection but also a lot of songs I must skip or else I'll go mad. For the originality, heavy sound and those mentioned 6 great songs I really must give them 85 points. All those other songs however take it down to 65 points.\n",
        "\nOkay. What actually happened here? Sepultura were really at their peak on the tour following the 'Arise' album. But how could that be leading to this? Did they feel they didn't have enough midpaced and slow songs in their set and decided to write a bunch and then had an album full of it? We could have seen it coming though. The songs \u2018Under Siege\u2019 and \u2018Altered State\u2019 from the \u2018Arise\u2019 album were actually an indication of a slower style and afterwards turned out to have been an omen for the basis of this \u2018Chaos A.D.\u2019 record. \n\n'Refuse/Resist' is the best song here. The only song that remains powerful from start to finish. The heartbeat-intro progressing into Brazilian drums was a good find and it sounds great. Riffs, vocals and solo are solid here and so are Igors drums. Great song. A bit different stylewise from earlier works, but no problems so far....\n\n'Territory' has a lot of groovy doom metal elements and the rhythmical Brazilian drums are quite enjoyable yet they should have been more present throughout the entire song. The extremely slow sections of the song just go on for far too long. It should have been followed by a fast track to keep the album interesting. Although on 'Slave new World' the pace was somewhat increased, one could not speak of an uptempo song. It isn\u2019t until \u2018Kaiowas\u2019 that something different finally happens. This accoustic intermezzo with nice rhythms gives the album an extra edge and is the first really interesting thing happening since the opening track. The song however is a bit too long for my taste and at times feels like a jam session instead of a song. \n\n\u2018Propaganda\u2019 continues the Slave New World and Amen style but is slightly better due to the fact that the pace is somewhat higher and the vocals have a catchy edge. The only truly uptempo song comes next. 'Biotech Is Godzilla' is one of the best songs on the album but isn't Sepultura. It\u2019s a punkrocksong co-written with Jello Biafra (also on guest vocals). Due to the different style and short length it is the kind of song you would normally expect as a bonus track or B-side to a single. It is, however, one of my favorite tracks on the album. \u2018Nomad\u2019 and \u2018Manifest\u2019 are once again mostly midtempo groovers but on \u2018Manifest\u2019 I rather like the whole intro. \u2018We Who Are Not as Others\u2019 is really the low point on the album. A doomy and monomtome track on which the title is repeated a lot of times. \u2018Clenched Fist\u2019 has a sparce fast moment and therefor actually becomes rather enjoyable. The New Model Army cover \u2018The Hunt\u2019 is adequate although I\u2019m missing some guitardetails from the original.\n\nAs a whole \u2018Chaos A.D.\u2019 was quite a disappointment. The production is good as were a few songs. But not enough to make this a memorable Sepultura release. There are too many Pantera-immitations presented here and not enough thrash nor Brazilian-rhythm moments to make up for the lack of speed. Also Max\u2019 vocals were getting too monotome at certain points here. The album wasn\u2019t exactly bad and I don\u2019t mind owning it and playing it from time to time. If it had been a new band and this would have been their debut, It might have gotten more points. But knowing the quality and intensity their previous four albums\u2026. Ouch\u2026only 60 points\n",
        "\nLet's be honoust. In essence there's a lot to laugh about concerning 'Morbid Visions'. These guys were still young kids here and it shows. The lyrics are pathetic and so are the performances and especially the sound. The compositions themselves stick to worshipping early-Kreator, Slayer and Sodom with more than a hint of 'The Return'-era Bathory. It wasn't until 'Schizophrenia' that the boys learned to play.\n\nHowever! It all seems to work for some reason. The enormously simplistic riffs, the hideous squeeky solos of Jairo, the straight forward drumming, the over the top reverbish vocals and the awful production alltogether form a truly 'evil' hyperactive atmosphere that I really still like to put on my recordplayer every once in a while after all these years. I dare say it's because all the flaws fall in place with eachother in exactly the right amount and balance.\n\nNot considering the performance and sound there are actually some great songs here. My personal favorite 'Crucifixion' (due to the vocal effects on the chorus and speed in general), 'Show Me The Wrath' and the titletrack of course. Most songs follow the same path and structure but the album doesn't get boring. The songs are all relatively short. The original version of 'troops Of Doom' is quite nice but the 1990 version showed the true potential of this song.\n\nYes, there's something about Morbid Visions\n",
        "\nWhereas on their 'Morbid Visions' album these young Brazilian chaps were still worshipping evil early speedmetal and thrash they knew from early Kreator, Sodom and Hellhammer with Jairo T. on Lead guitars, they now brought forth an album with some grown up thrash incorporating some bay area orientated riffing and now a new guy on leads, called Andreas Kisser. I've been told Kisser joined the band when most of the material was already written so apart from his leads his presence isn't fully up to the max here.\n\nThe songs presented on 'Schizophrenia' are a large step away from 'Morbid Visions' in terms of tightness, technicality, variation and riffing. Also no more weird paint or studded braces and all that. 'From the Past Come the Storms' and 'Escape to the Void' are two fully grown up powerfull thrashers with some mighty riffs and an amazing performance on drums by Igor Cavalera. Especially these two songs were an omen of what to expect from their next album. The vocals of Max are the missing link between 'Morbid Visions' and 'Beneath The Remains' being less 'evil' yet more agressive but still having an overdose of 'blackish reverb' over them.\n\nHearing 'Inquisition Symphony' when you're used to 'Morbid Visions' is like listening to another band. Sepultura had a go at writing an long thrash metal instrumental like for instance Metallica did on 'Call of Ktulu'. They actually succeeded at it. No wonder the song was an inspiration for the Finnish celloboys Apocalyptica. It simply is that good. And I believe someone earlier on Metal Archives mentioned the briliant 'To The Wall' with its great Kisser solo before? Well, I just did it again. The B-side of the album isn't as superb as the A-side but still these songs, of which 'Rest In Pain' is my favorite, would get 85 to 90 points. (and no, I don\u2019t count \u2018Troops Of Doom\u2019, I keep to the original tracklisting) So all in all we have a really strong album here.\n\nOnly two things that keep me from giving it 95 points. For one the production. Some guitar- and drumtracks were recorded too loud, resulting in some annoying interference. It's really raw but knowing 'Beneath the Remains' it should have had that sound as well. Secondly the reverb on the vocals is somewhat overdone.\n\nOhw, by the way, check out the Hetfield-look Max has on the backsleeve of the album. I though that was quite funny.\n",
        "\nMy first introduction to Sepultura was hearing 'Primitive Future' on the radio somewhere in 1989. Shortly after I saw the video to 'Inner Self' on Super Channel (remember that one?). I immediately went out to buy the album and at Dynamo Open air 1990 I stood in front waiting for these guys. I guess this says enough about how I feel concerning 'Beneath the Remains'. Not only is it by far the best Sepultura album ever made, it is also one of the best thrash metal albums ever made. The overall sound was vile, angry. The vocals were trully mean yet fortunately no real grunts. My god did this album thrash.\n\nAfter a beautiful intro, the titletrack sets the mood for the album. Raging uptempo thrashing madness which is actually very catchy. 'Inner Self' proved to be the 'lightest' song on the album, mostly bringing some excellent mdtempo riffing verses, an uptempo chorus and my favorite solo from the album. \n\nOther highlights include the already mentioned 'Primitive Future', 'Stronger than Hate', 'Slaves of Pain' and the mighty catchy thrasher 'Mass Hypnosis'. Objectively speaking Sepultura have never made a flawless album but the lesser interesting songs 'Sarcastic Existence', 'Lobotomy' and 'Hungry' are still of outstanding quality.\n\nCompositionally and productionally their most aggressive album. The sound of 'Beneath the Remains' shattered that of 'Schizophrenia' and the aggression presented here overthrew the dark 'Morbid Visions' album with ease. That is saying something, knowing both 'Schizophrenia' and 'Morbid Visions' are classics in their own way as well.\n\nThe riffs on 'Beneath...' are mostly simple but they are pretty catchy and deadly effective. The finishing touch is the magnificent drumming of Igor Cavalera. He plays his parts with mindblowing surgical tightness and a never ceasing amount of energy. It was on this album that the brothers Cavalera excell together in tightness and both perfectly coincide with the creative leads presented by Andreas Kisser. A classic of the purest kind.\n",
        "\nI'm not going to bore you with a long review. Every thrash-minded metalhead should simply own this album. Obviously it was an almost impossible task to come up with a worthy follow-up to their opus magnus 'Beneath the Remains' that had put them at the top of the thrash metal genre. But they certainly came close to providing something equally superb.\n\nTwo major changes can be found on 'Arise' compared to its predecessor. First thing is the production. Whereas 'Beneath...' was mostly brutal, this time there was more transparency in the overall sound and especially the drums had a cleaner sound. I'm not going to say which sound is better, 'cause i.m.o. both Beneath and Arise both sound exactly they way they should for some reason. Secondly the average pace was slightly lower and the use of clean guitars increased.\n\nWere it not for some fillers, the album would surely have become an even bigger thrash metal classic. The titletrack and 'Infected Voice' are two typical speedy Sepultura thrashers with some excellent yet simple and catchy riffs that continue where 'Beneath...' had left off. It were the songs 'Desperate Cry', 'Altered State' and 'Under Siege' that were a large step forward, incorporating more breaks, clean parts and a very dynamic extended structure. The intro to 'Altered State' was an omen of things to come on later albums.\n\nAnother great highlight on the album is the single 'Dead Embryonic Cells' which combined their well-known uptempo brutallity with some marvellous midtempo ranged pounding catchy thrash.\n\nUnfortunately 'Meaningless Movements', 'Subtraction'and 'Murder' were not equal to the rest of the material. They weren't bad songs. Not at all! They were actually pretty great. If they'd been on Chaos A.D. for that matter, they would have been highlights on that specific album. It's just that on 'Arise' the other songs were just...better.\n\nNot only did Max and Andreas excell on this album, so did Igor. He not only had the technique but also developed his own specific style. Paulo by the way has never played an important part to the sound. 'Arise' proved to be the last classic thrashing Sepultura album and I for one still cherish it.\n",
        "\nAfter putting out four albums which were the perfect blend of death and thrash metal with shitloads of riffs, Sepultura seemed to have run out of ideas. They couldn\u2019t come up with any new thrash riffs that were actually good, and the aggression they previously held was slipping away. They wanted to continue however, and so they released the steaming dung heap that would be known as Chaos AD.\n\nSee, the boys in Sepultura, having previously written songs with at least six riffs a song played at breakneck speed, weren\u2019t sure how to write another album considering their lack of solid riffs. So they picked some thrash riffs out at random, slowed them down and downtuned to make up for the lack of heaviness. This way they could have an excuse for playing slow to midpaced with a single riff per song, and to the people who said it wasn\u2019t thrash, they could counter them by saying it had a \u2018more crushing sound\u2019. They weren\u2019t really that angry as before, but they needed something to make it sound more metal, so they threw in some unintelligent lyrics focused around anti authority. Sure, they weren\u2019t exactly geniuses at writing lyrics on the previous albums, but at least those ones suited the type of music they used to play. Max Cavalera\u2019s voice was starting to go to shit but he couldn\u2019t sing, so instead of doing death-ish screams/growls, he opted for an idiotic sounding shout which was supposed to sound extreme and pissed off, but ended up sounding more annoying than anything else.\n\nThat\u2019s really what the album sounds like. When you combine all the aforementioned elements you get a pretty good image in your head of what the content involves. The whole thing drags along in the same pattern, not really changing or evolving or speeding up, just content to stay at the same pace, with the same sounding \u2018riffs\u2019, with the same drawn out shouts. As one could expect, this starts to get old quickly. While it isn\u2019t too bad listening to a song every now and then, trying to listen to the whole album is a chore, I myself only having done it once. It just stays the same, not managing to keep the listeners attention for more than five minutes or so. And just when a good riff comes along and manages to make the listener sit up, it is slaughtered by some stupid noises (Manifest), annoying vocals (Biotech is Godzilla) or something else of equal worthlessness. The album is 50 minutes long, but feels as if it should be 20, and the individual songs are too long at only 3 or 4 minutes.\n\nThis album is just pointless and worthless. When you consider who released it and the quality of their previous albums it feels as if it is a different band behind it. This isn\u2019t even recommended for people who are heavily into groove metal, and the few highlights (Refuse/Resist and Slave New World) are barely even worth downloading. This is a failure in every sense of the word, and a completely worthless album.\n",
        "\nOh Sepultura, what the hell happened? And why did people encourage you? Many mysteries surround this album from the Brazilian quartet, Where did the album come from? And why did people not jump on them and tell them emphatically \"No! Go back\"? There were no hints at what the album was going to be like, admittedly, Arise had a lot more crush and a lot less neck breaking thrash, but only in comparison to Schizophrenia and Beneath The Remains. Most of the other bands who had these massive changes have always had clues that it could happen, but really, there weren't any here. They just stopped kicking ass.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Sepultura have undergone some changes since Arise. And clearly, they're not very good. The band has adopted a more groove based approach, with the tribal sounds taking a larger hold over the band, rather than just being a cool signature to mix up the speed. Now, I love groove metal and half-thrash, as its where I came into metal from, but this is just bad half-thrash. Almost every riff just sounds so damn boring. I bought this at the height of my half-thrash adoration period, and it still bored me to tears. And yes, this is before I heard any of the earlier albums, so it's not even in comparison, it sucks outright.\n\nThings kick off well enough, Refuse/Resist has a couple of faster thrashish punk riffs in it's arsenal, and I happen to be a fan of Max's lower, louder vocals. Although they do suffer from 'vocal retardation', where the approach of singing makes the vocalist sound like they're retarded. This is usually seen in bad death metal vocalists. Territory has a couple of nice groove riffs as the band shows off it's new half-thrash style, namely tom heavy drumming, and riffs which generally involve a couple of quick notes followed by a drawn out one or two. It's fun for about two songs.\n\nUnfortunately by the time 'Amen' chugs around, everything is kind of dull. And unfortunately doing spoken verses isn't the way to excite people. And you find yourself losing concentration on the music, and thinking about insects in the room, and whether you remembered to put your phone on the charger. And 40 minutes of thinking about unrelated things later, the album finishes, and you can't remember a moment of what you just listened to. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how they got away with this, most people will tell you to go out and buy this one first, even people who hate the new stuff. It just doesn't make sense, Sepultura were never really a band you listened to for variation, or overt technicality, neither of which are present here, but hell they had so much energy, and really, that was it. If you take away that energy Sepultura are just an average band with a slight change in sound because they're not from a standard geographical area. That's it...\n\nThe production on offer is meaty and as heavy as possible, which is a good choice if moving into a half-thrash sound. Oh how Vio-lence missed that on 'Nothing to Gain'. At least that album had great music being played, this one doesn't have that, it only has the right production.\n\nGuitar wise, there's some problems, Max Cavelara and Andreas Kisser both put in dull performances. None of the riffs have any bite, or are really all that catchy, it's like Pantera without any drive behind it, it's just some low notes being played after each other with no reason. The soling is pretty shit too, but not too many groove bands had great soloists in them.\n\nMost of the faster riffs come across as punk to me, just like with Nailbomb I'm pretty sure it's the name which makes people say 'that's a thrash riff' instead of a punk riff. Manifest has some cool stuff, but the only other song which tries to pick up speed, 'Biotech is Godzilla', is ruined beyond imagination by the lyrics and the pathetic little add-ins after the chorus, such as the nauseatingly bad 'Godzilla... raaar'. This sort of shit happens much too often too, such as the stupid laughing at the ends of a couple of songs.\n\nThe drumming here is actually pretty nice, being a half-thrash fan, I love it when the drums get a big say in the sound, and Igor certainly has some fun with his new production, as the massive drum sound does suit his very powerful drumming. As with all Sepultura albums, the bass is insignificant.\n\nVocally, Max is a little excessive in his desire to be heavy. I like them, but he tends to sounds a bit mentally challenged as he slurs his words stupidly. Very much a personal taste and can easily piss people off. Lyrically, he is disgraceful, 'We Who Are Not As Others' has the title as it's only lyrics. And yes, it's a full song, Max just repeats the title a dozen times. Of course you have your un-knowledgeable protest songs, such as the previously mentioned 'Biotech...', which seems to be like Max just thought, 'biological engineering sounds bad, I think I don't like it... I wonder what it involves, never mind, It's just bad, like Godzilla', and then wrote a bunch of stupid lyrics. Most of the other songs take the idea of 'We Who Are Not As Others', and extended that notion out to 3 verses and a chorus.\n\nOverall this an poor album, in fact it outright sucks, and wouldn't even garner attention if it weren't for the albums before it. There's a few good riffs on some of the songs, Manifest, and The Hunt Come to mind, and the grooves are catchy enough on Territory, but for the main part, this is a terrible album, and should have been a black mark in the bands history, but people an embraced it, and now look what we have... Thanks fans.\n",
        "\nYou know, I love it when trends collide with trends...it helps expose the ironic hypocrisy so many people claim not to follow but do so sub-consciously. Case in point: this obsession with the term \"mallcore\".\n\nNow, just so you know, I'm against pretty much ANY kind of popular music based mostly on the fact that it's NOT music (pop punk, emo, alt rock, goth rock, pussy pop, etc.), though the fact that so many idiots blindly follow such meanderings doesn't forgive the situation. This becomes the original trend; \"you gotta do what we do, follow what we follow, or you're a freak and we hate you!\" Such self-defeating mindsets do nothing but make you out to be the weaker person, the parasite spreading your pitiful plague on other weak people who wish only to be accepted and live an artificial life devoid of ANY sense of free thought and individuality.\n\nHowever...along comes the people who decry their lifestyle and musical tastes, and sometimes even go so far as to denounce and hate certain musical groups for changing their style and supposedly \"selling out\" and becoming, as they call it, \"mallcore\". These groups and albums are hated because the band chose to do something different and to NOT listen to the wishy-washy fans demanding they re-record their best album time and time again or they'll denounce the band's existence, as though THEIR opinions are what mattered, despite the fact that the die-hards enjoy the band's music for what it is, rather than what it should be, and at times speak the loudest. These fickle so-called \"metal-heads\" have their own lifestyle the newbies and trend-whores must follow: \"you gotta do what we do, follow what we follow, or you're a freak and we hate you!\".\n\n\"Do what thou wilt, shalt be the whole of the law\" then becomes \"Do as we say, not as we do\", exposing the hypocritical poison.\n\nIronic that the trend-haters become the very thing they despise at the end of the day, isn't it? I personally think so.\n\nBut I'm once again getting ahead of myself...I'm here to review an album, after all. So apologies to everyone for the time I've supposedly wasted. Here we are, then...SEPULTURA's first album sans Max \"I love God\" Cavalera quit to display his masterbatory brand of heavenly worship via simplistic nu metal noise romps in SOULFLY, and left Andreas Kisser as the sole riff-smith and main creative force for \"Against\". In my humble opinion, this album isn't as bad as SO MANY PEOPLE claim it to be...if you took the album at face value and not \"the album SEPULTURA was SUPPOSED to release!\" it's not that horrible. I don't find it mind-blowingly awesome by any means, but I've heard worse. The entire album teems with a sense of anger and rage that was absent in the band's nu metal wanderings in \"Roots\", and a sense of revenge seems apparently dominant, as seen best on tracks such as the title track, \"Old Earth\", and \"Choke\". Andreas does his job well, and though his hardcore riff stylings aren't always in best form, it's angrier and more digestable than most hardcore music out there. However, the over-all compositions come off as lacking, obviously only half an old SEPULTURA song. Igor's drumwork is as top-notch as ever, infusing thrash skin-beats and the now traditional tribal percussion work in a nice, palpable mix. In the vocal seat is one Derrick Green, who, I know, ISN'T Max, but his roaring vocals seem the fit the musical scheme of things rather nicely (I have yet to see him sing older songs, so I can't comment THAT much about him). The production is clean and clear, giving the guitars a sharp, razor-like approach, and the percussion powerful blasts.\n\nIn the end...\"Against\" is NOT a perfect SEPULTURA album, but it's not the end-all-be-all of this supposed \"mallcore\" scene, as there are FAR worse albums and bands out there to devote all that hate to. Remember, my metal brothers and sister...Emo is still alive and active...\n",
        "\nThis album pretty much embodies the principle reason why I hate the vast majority of groove metal albums. We have random vocal grunts and barks that are supposed to articulate masculinity and aggression, repetitive and over simplified riffs often consisting of two or three notes, way too much emphasis on the drums, nonsensical lyrics that would make the staunchest of anarchists embarrassed of his ideology, and a sheer lack of speed. You could sum this album up as being a half-assed rehash of Pantera\u2019s \u201cVulgar Display of Power\u201d with a heavy Brazilian accent, even less standout songs, and a complete lack of coherence in the arrangement. \n\nAlthough the vast majority of the riffs on here are over-simplified groove drones that induce testicle shrinkage in the listener, the few leads found on here succeed in achieving the opposite extreme. While Dimebag Darrel was a sort of saving grace within the fatal mediocrity of Pantera\u2019s sound, Andreas Kisser succeeds only in making random noises due to overuse of the whammy bar and effects pedals, sounding more like random computer generated sounds than guitar solos. The worst offender is the lead break found on \u201cTerritory\u201d, although similarly forgettable collections of half cocked improvised nonsense can be found on several other songs (\"Biotech is Godzilla\" anyone?), to speak nothing for the occasional high ends drones that probably inspired Korn like the one found at the intro of \u201cPropaganda\u201d.\n\nSome of the songs on here might pass for decent punk rock songs if the vocals weren\u2019t so damned terrible and the words so ridiculous. \u201cBiotech is Godzilla\u201d (what a stupid name) could almost pass for an S.O.D. song if the singing wasn\u2019t so poorly done. \u201cSlave New World\u201d has a couple of solid riffs that come and go, but Max Cavalera\u2019s voice track completely buries them. The same thing could also be said about \u201cPropaganda\u201d and \u201cAmen\u201d, both of which would sound like decent Pantera songs if the mix was more even and the guitars could be heard clearly.\n\nThe remaining stuff on here is forgettable, disappointing, or just flat out annoying. \u201cRefuse, Resist\u201d takes my pick for the worst song on the album, featuring a sleep inducing principle riff consisting of two notes, and a plodding beat that makes Machine Head sound like Megadeth circa 1986. The cover of \u201cThe Hunt\u201d would be decent, but is utterly destroyed by the vocals, despite not being as ridiculously high in the mix as with the other songs. \u201cKaiowas\u201d is a rather annoying acoustic jam session under the guise of some kind of protest song, featuring ideas that sound akin to hillbilly folk music. Actor Christopher Lee once quoted a person as saying \u201cYou should try everything except incest and folk dancing\u201d, but it seems that the boys in Sepultura felt differently. \n\nTo put it plainly, if you like metal in any of its variants, avoid this album. Even if you like groove metal (why you would I\u2019ll never know), there is better stuff out there carrying that label. I bought this album thinking I was picking up the latest release by a band credited as influential in the thrash/death genre, and boy was I in for a rude awakening. If you are overcome with a desire to own it nonetheless, take the advice of the first song, REFUSE!\n",
        "\nRoadrunner Records 1995\nReviewed: Special edition 2005\n\n\nBrazilian metallists retreat into the Brazilian jungle and re-emerge with this lovingly repackaged masterwork.\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that you happen upon a truly original album. An album where the musicians immerse themselves in the very elements of their heritage, and allow it to change them into an artistic force the likes of which will never be seen again. An album that is as much about a country and a civilization as a band. But then, it\u2019s not every day that you hear an album like \u201cRoots\u201d.\n\nBrazilian thrash metal monsters Sepultura\u2019s sixth album was always going to be a challenge. How could a band possibly improve on the brilliance that was the legendary \u201cChaos AD\u201d? One thing was for sure; they could only fail by walking the same path they had successfully journeyed five times before. So they decided to extract their patented take on crushingly heavy thrash/death metal, a hint of the at-the-time cutting edge nu-metal sound, and most importantly, their Brazilian musical culture, and create something monumental. The result is \"Roots\". From working alongside the famous percussionist Carlinhos Brown on the landmark song \u201cRatamahatta\u201d to performing with the Xavantes Tribe, the true music of Brazil, an exclusive club which Sepultura must surely now belong to, is explored and incorporated. And it works perfectly.\n\nFrom the opening echoes that introduce the metal anthem \u201cRoots Bloody Roots\u201d to the end, the intriguing, initially untitled \u201cCanyon Jam\u201d, this is so heavy you can feel it pressing from inside you outwards. However, it is unquestionably the balance that this record achieves that makes it so essential. For every few guitar-heavy thrash masterwork there is a mild-mannered acoustic track or samba-groove piece. However, it is the songs which sound so integrally \u201cBrazilian\u201d that work the best. While the aforementioned \u201cRatamahatta\u201d is spectacular, and obviously of this criterion, it is the excellent \"Itsari\", a track recorded at the traditional home of the Xavantes tribe, with the tribe\u2019s people chanting in the background that truly realizes the goal of this album .Also notable is the obvious Nu-metal influence. But of course, this is the grimy, grinding, painful nu-metal KoRn were successfully peddling before Linkin Park and company introduced a new generation to heavy music, thus defining the Mallcore label that is now used by anyone looking to incriminate anything more melodic than Anal Cunt. Indeed, KoRn singer Jonathon Davis and future Limp Bizkit member DJ Lethal contribute to the song \u201cLookaway\". \n\nHowever, despite this indigenous, acoustic twist, this is an extreme metal album and this is an extreme metal band, and throughout the majority of the album, this shows. The tracks, even through their progressive ideas, are still packed with enough metal brilliance to remind people; this is Sepultura, one of the main innovators of death/thrash, perhaps proving themselves the equals of legends like Slayer, Kreator or Death Angel. The enthusiastic passion for music that these men show is infectious, and the guitars still grind, the drums still pound and the vocals are still as raw, hostile and ferocious as they were when this band were still playing songs with names like \u201cDead Embryonic Cells\u201d. Of course, they mellow out when performing with the indigenous people - they would probably otherwise be mistaken for demons - but tracks such as \u201cRoots Bloody Roots\u201d, \u201cAttitude\u201d and \u201cEndangered Species\u201d all chug along superbly, and leave you full, happy and satisfied by the time the sixteen tracks are over.\n\nAnd what sixteen tracks they are. We are taken from a grinding manifesto of the album via an anti-deforestation song, among others, to what a Brazilian carnival may sound like if a bouncier Slayer tribute band was playing. From there, we are bought through the dark, heavy world of aggression to a sudden clearing. An acoustic piece followed by the mighty \u201cItsari\u201d, and, following a few last songs, the conclusion a strangely haunting thirteen-minute instrumental - of sorts \u2013 which consists of them throwing rocks or playing strange instruments in a cleverly microphoned canyon. The sounds, initially weird, paint a haunting soundscape progressive bands like Opeth, Coheed and Cambria, and Sunn 0))) still struggle to create.\n\nThe only criticisms that the more metal-y tracks have a tenancy to meld into one another; there's only so much you can do with downtuned guitars. The album is also overlong; at over 72 minutes, it seems like the kind of challenge you just can\u2019t be bothered with. However, it is a suitably heavy, and surprisingly progressively-minded, release from a band who completely deserve all of their success. \u201cRoots\u201d is earthy, organic, deep, and indigenous; primitive, yet compelling.\n\nThis is an album which gives so much, and only asks that you allow it to unravel itself .While not as good as \u201cChaos AD\u201d, this is clearly a great album that, even in retrospect, deserved every bit of praise it got. Even though Roadrunner Records themselves told Sepultura this concept was \u201ccommercial suicide\u201d, that the album saw such critical and commercial mass worship speaks for itself; originality isn\u2019t as loathed as was previously thought. This is the reason Breed 77 included their native flamenco music into their style, of why System of a Down were given a chance to sound so strangely Serbian. This is an outstanding work of sonic art that still seems new and exiting to those of us who only discover it now.\n\nOnly repetition and length problems stop this being on par with the metal greats, but hey, you can\u2019t fault their artistic integrity.\n",
        "\nProbably the album that got me into metal for real. At first I hailed this as a masterpiece but, fuck, I didn't know the truth so I was satisfied by all that this LP gave me. I was satisfied with something like: WOW three super kick-ass fuckin songs, another two very good, one quite good, and three pieces of shit. Then I finally listened to their previous LP, Beneath the Remains and I finally understood...\n\nThis is not a bad album, don't misunderstand me, it is quite good, but only because it's standout tracks really kick ass. The mediocre tracks are so fuckin boring. I tell you now, if this albums falls into your hands, just think that songs Altered State and Under Siege (and maybe Meaningless Movements) don't exist. Then you have a great 25min-or-so album. If you get the remaster you are more lucky because there is one other track C.I.U. (Criminals in Uniform) which is equally good with the good ones.\n\nNow, to the point. This album begins with the kinda catchy \"Arise\". Yeah, it is catchy but is fucking great. Thankfully it doesn't follow verse-chorus patterns but only the thing that it is something like 3:18 means it's kind of a short song for Sepultura (for Schizophrenia, Beneath the Remains era). Anyway, all this shit doesn't matter as the song is very good, a videoclip was also made for this one. Then we have \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" which has it's fast moments along with mid-paced stuff, generally not as brutal as the first song but a great one too, i think a videoclip was made for this one too. Now, \"Desperate Cry\" for me is the highlight. This is a fuckin trademark for Sepultura, the song starts in a slow manner then we got the mid-paced verse and chorus stuff and then the fast stuff fuckin kick in, fucking awesome, everytime I fuckin hear this I can feel this primitive and raw feeling, I mean they fuckin prepare you for the first two minutes and then you rip your own head off. The song then goes mid-pace again and has a melodic solo. Excellent song, probably my personal favorite of the album. Then we got \"Murder\" a song that thrashes quite good. I don't really see something in the first half, but the second half of the song really KICKS ASS. \"Subtraction\" is a very good thrasher. Now, welcome to the shit. Altered State is some kind of slowed down \"do-you-remember-when-we-played-thrash\" stuff which I don't really understand, seems like riffs and ideas they had (or probably even played in the past) just played in slow tempo. Yeah, this is a fuckin foreteller of the shit that's about to come in the next year. They even played this shit live I mean they were satisfied by this kind of work. Why the fuck were they satisfied? Don't ask me, cause I'm gonna tell you that even ONE riff from Schizophrienia or Beneath the Remains is better than this whole song. Same goes for \"Under Siege\" I don't know what of these two pussies is better, probably the second pussy. \"Meaningless Movements\" is something like the title of the song, I mean this thrashes good at some times but it seems to me like it is something that was forced out of them, It didn't come out natural, seems like they said, okay this is supposed to be a thrash record so let's just not put more pussy-crap inside, and they all agreed but not because they really wanted to compose thrash, they agreed with sad look on their faces... Don't worry boys, you're gonna have infinite time to suck dick after this LP. The final track is \"Infected Voice\" which really brings us back to thrash. All is great and it's boiling heat and some riffs might remind me even of Beneath the Remains. Anyway, excellent song, only thing that's fucked up is the solo, I really don't like this solo it is kind of anti-metal it reminds me of the shit they'd play later in their \"career\" I don't know, they probably got tired of the metal solos they played some years ago.\n\nMy personal opinion about the production is that it is worse than Beneath the Remains. I mean there's a heavy guitar sound which is not needed in THRASH but probably in this \"stuff\" they wanted to start playing in this album. The thrashing songs in this album seem kind of strange, at moments, with this sound. The others however seem totally cool, yeah, when you start running out of riffs, you do shit like that to fill the gaps of your music. Nevertheless, it seems that this production was unavoidable since they decided to put some tracks like Altered State and Under Siege inside.\n\nLyrics are kinda in the mood of Beneath the Remains but looking much more tired. First of all some songs got pretty much shitty lyrics like \"Arise\", they seem like fuckin cheesy to me sometimes, looking back in Beneath the Remains and seeing that there was no such crap. Anyway, generally, and ideologically probably, they are in the patterns of Beneath the Remains.\n\nOverally, a good album with three shitty songs. My recommendation is VERY simple. If you know about thrash etc go buy Beneath the Remains. If you are a beginner and you want to know about thrash this is a good album for you. If you have Beneath the Remains and Schizophrenia etc and you WORSHIP that albums, it is kind of dangerous, but I think you'll like it. Signs of the decline DO SHOW here but they are not so much to fuck this record up. It is ready to suck dick but it doesn't, not like their next LP Chaos A.D.. However, don't expect to find another \"From the Past Comes the Storms\" here...\n\nListen to: \"Arise\", \"Dead Embryonic Cells\", \"Desperate Cry\"\nDon't listen to: \"Altered State\", \"Under Siege\", \"Meaningless Movements\"\n",
        "\nIt's Sepultura's third full length but only the second if you consider the newfound direction starting with 1987 Schizophrenia.\n\nThings are simple here. I could easily go into a moronic-mode and start barking that this album is a huge part of my life and emotionally driven shit like that etc etc. Instead I will comment objectively and state, in full awareness, my belief that this is the best album of music related to Speed Metal/Thrash. At least of what I've listened to.\n\nSchizophrenia showed a great deal of potential but the technique needed to play this style of metal was quite out of reach for Sepultura. Andreas Kisser was an excellent guitarist at that time, adding new sense of melody to Sepultura but, probably, he and Max needed a bit more practice to explode from the Death Metal they played into the more Speed oriented stuff. This grey area between Speed Metal and Death Metal was explored by many bands in the mid and late 80's (Slayer, Kreator, Sodom, Rigor Mortis etc) featuring the song structures and riffs of Speed Metal (although some times riffs could arguably enter the Death Metal division), the growls of early Death Metal and probably the tempo of Thrash cause Speed Metal never reached this speed before. In my opinion Sepultura explored this era with the most free and creative mind. Creating a language of their own by not being attached to any genre. Beneath the Remains is the gem of this exploration and quest and it is also the highest moment of Sepultura's career.\n\nThe album starts with Beneath the Remains, a magnificent masterpiece of controlled and directed energy. Kickass parts from the track's solo till the end. Inner Self follows up which is a Speed Metal hymn, one of the most famous songs of Sepultura, slower than the title track but good. Stronger than Hate is probably my favorite track. Pure energy and powerful lyrics. Magnificent riffcraft for the biggest parts of the song. Mass Hypnosis is another classic of Speed Metal structuring with excellent melodic parts in the middle of the song. Sarcastic Existance is a piece of delightful headbanging which (along with the last track of the album) are my favorites lyrically. This song deals about war probably and in an excellent manner. Slaves of Pain is possibly my least favorite of the album but still kicks ass (the first half of the song is fucking excellent). Lobotomy is the most progressive attempt in this album and upholds this quite good, containing many riffs and tempo changes. Hungry is a kind of melodic track dealing about social stuff and finally, Primitive Future is an epic, a prognosis of humanity and this world with supreme headbanging intent and top-class lyrics. The album leaves you wanting more...\n\nWhat can I say? The only reason I give it an 98% is that I just hold the two last ratings (99 and 100) for ultra super fuckin special reasons. I sincerely state that this is the fuckin best thrash-related metal album of all time. I can say that this is my favorite album of metal music. It is perfect in almost every aspect, it literally never slows down, song structures are masterpieces, sometimes they put melodic touch but this whole thing is so fuckin anti-modern that I feel full of fuckin 80's energy every time I listen to this album, even in its melodic moments. It chops in half the dick of everyone claiming that The Haunted Made me Kill Myself and all this Gothentrend shit is thrash-style. Beneath the Remains will teach you (if you are a beginner) what the fuck is thrash. What the fuck thrash was supposed to be.\n\nRiffcraft here is not as necrohellish as is on the previous records of this band but instead show zero intention to sound satanic or occult or metal or shit or whatever the fuck every band hailing from the underground is in fear of not sounding like. This is to their favor because when these kind of things emerge, probably the whole thing is controlled by such ideas and the bands that work like that are kinda immature and are being lead by a lot of underground trends so they lack originality. Believe me MANY bands are like that, especially in the South American Underground, Sepultura are maybe slightly aware that they are getting to be well-known so what they make is not so underground-elitism stuff but they show some mainstream metal influence too, not bad, sometimes this is needed too, blind rejection of the mainstream is ... blind. In a few words, in this time of their career, Sepultura don't give a FUCK about their image but they only care about the music, and this fuckin shows real good in Beneath the Remains. Plus that there's a huge improvement in rythm guitar technique and compelxity.\n\nSo... The 80's sadly wave goodbye and give their metal throne to the debatable 90's and Sepultura after conquering, through Cogumelo Records, South America, decide to conquer the world of metal. Scott Burns' production is excellent and if you ask me better in a lot of ways than Arise (my humble opinion). Every instrument is represented like it should be and guitar is not heavy as fuck like arise which kinda ruins the speedy feeling. Igor Cavallera also sounds a lot better here than in Arise. He is fuckin insane and absolutely fuckin precise, sometimes it drives me mad thinking he can burst into thrash rythms any time, EXPLOSIVE fuckin percussion here. Super highlight of the album.\n\nEpilogue: 98%. If you want to show what the fuck metal means to one friend of you, lend him this album but if he accidentaly loses it or destroys it, rape his mother and sacrifice his whole neighborhood to Satan. If you don't have this album, go buy it NOW or die. No, seriously, I can't think of a possible reason why you wont like this album, it represents everything thrash ever stood for and there's nothing fuckin modern to be found here. EVEN if you aren't much into thrash or speed. If you are into these genres and you don't have this album simply you don't know what the fuck you are missing. EXTREMELY recommended to any self-respecting human being that wishes to be called a metalhead (or if he doesn't give a fuck about how will he be called).\n",
        "\nSo sue me, I'm open minded. While everybody else thinks that Sepultura effectively died after \"Arise\" (a classic album of theirs, I agree), some folks are being unfair to this album. This was, for me anyway, the last gasp of Sepultura as a thrash-oriented band before they went into nu-metal/fellating Ross Robinson mode, and instead of a gasp it's more a final bellow of defiance, if you ask me. \n\nYes, they began incorporating the tribal elements more, yes, they slowed down the tempos more, but there is still plenty of aggression to be found here, plenty of speed still. The title track is one of the slower ones, but to me it reeks of attitude, and is a statement of \"Hey, get off your ass and do something! Don't let 'em grind you down!\", and likewise for \"Territory\", which is powerful and solid, a good strong headbanging groove. The latter also features a sweet little otherworldly solo break from the underrated Andreas Kisser. \n\n\"Nomad\" brings the groove some more, as does the only other throwaway track here, \"We Who Are Not As Others\"--I could've done without that one even years after the fact. And \"Manifest\" is an abrasive and lurching industrial-flavored track with screeching atonal guitar parts and distorted spoken vocals that I still think is quite creepy. But there's still lots of speed and aggression, as I already mentioned; \"Biotech is Godzilla\" is a frenzied heads-down charge through hardcore punk territory, and \"Slave New World\", while not thrash per se, delivers a slamming up-tempo jolt as well. The New Model Army cover is pretty close to the original, actually, but tuned down a little lower and with Max' guttural yelling instead of Justin Sullivan's smooth and passionate baritone, and while it's not essential to the album I like it anyway because it shows they have good taste in music other than metal, for one thing. \n\nTheir sociopolitical commentary became even more pronounced on this album too, with songs like \"Manifest\", an account of a Brazilian prison riot fuelled by police brutality, and \"Biotech is Godzilla\" which ends with the inflammatory statement \"Biotech...is AIDS!\" in case anybody was wondering. \"Nomad\" speaks of indigenous tribal peoples being sold out and ripped off by the \"civilized\" world as imperialism continues to this day, and the brief break of tribal chanting and percussion near the end is haunting. \"Kaiowas\", while intriguing, is another throwaway ultimately as it really doesn't do anything for the album's pacing or atmosphere.\n\nIn the long run, this album holds up well enough to count as a good effort that showed Sepultura still had the potential to rouse the punters. I still like it just fine, myself, and I'd encourage people to at least give it a chance and be open minded about it before trashing it.\n",
        "\nI started listening to Sepultura circa 1996, Roots era. Little did I know how fucking excellent they were just a few years before. As I mentioned in the review of Roots my friend lent me this and 'Beneath The Remains'. Absolutely insane stuff. I immediately went to the store to buy this, BTR and Arise because I was recommended that if I liked the other two. Why Thrash Metal died or went out of style is beyond comprehension. This album is brimful of rhythm and riffs it's like an orgasmic experience for any Thrash Metal fan. When these guys were in prime form they were up there with Slayer, Kreator and Megadeth's best work. \n\nSchizophrenia captures a young, hungry bunch of guys at their raw and creative best. It's also the first album with lead guitarist Andreas Kisser and the legendary lineup. They had so much to prove and they were highly influenced by various metal genres; black (Venom, Hellhammer, Sarcofago), thrash (Slayer, Metallica, Kreator), death (Death, Possessed, Sodom) metal. It contains a little bit of everything in there but made it all their own style. This was a time when they let loose and didn't care about record sales or image. It was when they played what they felt and were very passionate about it as well. Nowadays it seems like they just keep doing it just to keep themselves occupied and maybe cash in on past fame, albums like this one. \n\nAs for this album, where to begin? It's hard to pinpoint one exact song. They all follow a similar path, just thrash away with rocking rhythms and sick fucking solos galore. Andreas Kisser made such a great debut that he'd already immortalized himself before their peak on Arise. 'From The Past Comes The Storms' all the way up to 'Troops Of Doom' the band never lets up. Every song starts out fast and they don't really hit their peak until midway through each song with mind blowing solos and riffs. And each one is original and not recycled to boot. It was magic on tape, even if they re-recorded this music with the original lineup right now it still wouldn't sound as good as it did back in 1987. It was something that came form within that made this sound better than your average thrash band from the 80's. They had spirit, anger, passion, talent and creativity. They had it all working at once on put it out for this album and the next two releases for that matter. \n\nToday, the well seems to have dried up. Every metal band goes through it, but some get that second wind back. Hopefully this band can make one last classic before it's done. Maybe not, but this album deserves to be owned by every metal fan in the world. Yeah it's Hall Of fame material. A truly magical moment indeed.\n",
        "\nI first heard about this band when this album came out back in '96. I heard 'Roots Bloody Roots' and I thought it was an okay song. I decided to buy the album and I believe that after listening to the entire album about 3 times I just put it away in the corner assuming that I would listen to it again someday. About 5 years later it collected dust and eventually was sold with other used cd's that didn't cut the mustard either. \n\nI had a friend who swore that Sepultura was fucking lengendary and I had looked at him like \"what's so legendary about these guys?\". He lent me two cd's, 'Schizophrenia' and Beneath The Remains'. Those two releases alongside 'Arise' and yeah even 'Chaos AD' is what made them the best metal band from Brazil, ever. Roots is just a sellout atrocity. With Chaos AD it was a step in a different direction into Tribal Metal which was new at the time and not a bad idea, especially when its executed right. It was a really good album in my eyes, but little did I know what monsters it would create just 3 years later. The mistake Sepultura or Max made was to keep going in the same direction. These guys were the fucking shit at making true thrash metal. They drifted away from it with Chaos AD which was okay as long as it was a \"one-off\" thing. Kind of like giving them time to think up some good thrash riffs and to decompress from it as well. \n\nSo three years later they embrace their new style and completely make a half-assed album. The guitars are downtuned too much, the lyrics are something that an angry high school teen may have written while listening to Shitknot. I'm not sure if this was Max's idea to make this type of music of the entire band, but if indeed it was Max who thought up this garbage it makes sense he's no longer with the band. With his new band 'Soulfly' he can do all the Tribal/Nu/Groove Metal he wants without conflict of interest since he IS the band. Roots marked the \"end\" of Sepultura in many fans eyes. It was the last album with the original lineup of Max and Igor Cavalera with A.Kisser and Paulo Jr. Also a huge chunk of their fanbase went away knowing that this was it for them. In a way this album is so fucking terrible that the band 10-11 years on still haven't recovered from it.\n\nEven though the last two albums Roorback and Dante XXI are actually better than Roots and some of the most listenable material from them since 1993 the damage has been done. A big thing that Roots did was spawn bands like Korn, Shitknot, all the other Nu-Metal/Groove bands that occupy people's ipods now. The teenagers of today think this is metal music, if only they could hear some of this bands material from 85-91 along with Sextrash, Sarcofago, Massacra, Kreator, Death and Possessed. Music today would benefit from people listening to the real music from that era. Maybe even Speultura themselves. \n\nAs for the album Roots, I am required to actually review this thing. The music takes the idea initially used on 'Chaos AD' and goes further into it. But using more of a South American rhythm and tribal sound while completely sacrificing any real guitar rhythm or solos that was in abundance just a few years prior. It seems like this was released just to make a buck, it was their most commercially successful release and very visible to the average joe, unfortunately people formed bands to this style of music. The first song 'Roots Bloody Roots' is listenable for a couple of minutes when you realize that the lyrics really have no depth or actual thought behind them and without riffs your attention drifts away. 'Ratamahatta' sounds like Korn went on a trip to the Amazon jungle and made a song about it, just mumbling and screaming gibberish. The rest of the album doesn't offer anything different or nor does it give you hope of rekindling the past. It's so bad it's depressing, mainly because this was the same band that made classic songs like; Mass Hypnosis, Dead Embryonic Cells, Septic Schizo, Troops Of Doom, etc. Pick anything from 85-93. It blows this away by miles. \n\nI give this a fifteen because some songs do grab your attention and in some way it's like a car accident, you can't help but look away. With this you can't help but listen to what all the negativity is about. People familar with the old stuff will cry after hearing this album. Shame on you guys for making this album.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s another love-it-or-you-don\u2019t release from the second era of Sepultura, this time a full-on live 2 CD set. Exactly what is a metal reviewer to think? \n\nAt this point, there is no way that the band is going to be hailed by fans of the Max-era as anything but a shell of their former selves, and that\u2019s too bad. Sepultura post-Max has reeled off a few brutal gems of their own, but there\u2019s no escaping the fact that singer Derrick Green in no way comes close to being the excellent vocal fit that Max was for the group\u2019s sound, nor can he compete with the Brazillian thrash god\u2019s previous four-string guitar assault. With this live document, listeners will hear that Green has the ability to deliver the tracks that he has recorded with the band with an aggressive competence, but his performance on the Sepultura\u2019s older material falls considerably short of what fans expect to hear from these songs. Far short.\n\nSo although \u201cApes Of God\u201d gets things off to a whiplash-inspiring start, \u201cInner Self/Beneath The Remains\u201d is almost painful to listen to without cringing. \u201cTroops Of Doom?\u201d Forget it. Even with Jairo popping in for a visit, the track has nowhere near the impact that it possessed in a live setting as it did with Max at the microphone. \n\nCertainly, \u201cBlack Steel In The Hour Of Chaos\u201d and \u201cBullet The Blue Sky\u201d are intended to draw in a wider crowd and the fans of Sao Paulo certainly seem up for the diversity, but \u201cRefuse/Resist\u201d remains declawed and \u201cArise/Dead Embryonic Cells\u201d makes one wonder why the group continues on with a bad parody of itself. \n\nThe low points are balanced by solid performances of newer Sepultura tracks like \u201cChoke\u201d, and it\u2019s enough to make this a good record, barely. Old school fans however will likely avoid the imitation and wait for the real deal to re-emerge or stick with the records they already have. The recordings with Max are much too superior to the versions laid out on this live effort.\n\nFrom \"Weapons Of Mass Destruction\" by Erin Fox\n",
        "\nIn this album, Sepultura though they should improve their technique from Morbid Visions and play this more traditional thrash-influenced material. While their first LP was more or less black/death metal lyrically and musically, this album is a foreteller of what has to come. To the Wall speaks about Max's tough life and struggles. That lyrical theme is an immature version of the themes in Beneath the Remains and Arise which are more or less about society and politics. Sepultura begin to know themselves and thats what drives them off their fake Satanism. Wagner \"Antichrist\" leaves the band and Andreas Kisser replaces him on guitars. He does an excellent job, It's easy to understand how much better a lead guitar player he is than \"Antichrist\".\n\n\nThe structure of the songs is more mature than Bestial but of course nowhere near Beneath the Remains.. But it's still quite good. There are more tempo changes and more riffs than Bestial. This album is very sincere in its teenage confusion and it's in the process of one understanding himself and creating a theory about life. The frustration and injustice of the world and of life itself is such a huge action that urges an equally huge reaction which is this album. Not very lucid, not a political message. Very very awkward and truthfull.\n\n\nThe above is the reason an asshole fan of the radio-friendly bands would never understand this album. They don't want to see all this injustice and hate so they find it useless to react and scream and fuckin hit the drums into creating an opus of anger and truth.\n\n\nSchizophrenia is the point where quantity meets quality. Where rage meets technique. Where reaction meets comprehension. If you asked me why I liked this album I couldn't find a possible answer but however I wouldn't be one of the bunch of people who would say: \"Yeah! This album kicks ass. Fuckin slayer fuckin staff. Thrashers mothafuckas\". No not at all. This album is not simple anti-social teenage stuff that want to shock people. Screaming about Satan and Nazis, two of the biggest anti-figures in modern society just to be anti-society. Sepultura follow their heart and gradually begin to understand that there is no use to create a stupid image for your band and sound metal or sound punk or sound shit I don't know what. All that matters is play what you have in your head, play the music that expresses you. So in my opinion they are not just \"Fuckin Thrashers\" they are so much more than that. Go listen to \"The Abyss\" instrumental which is a truthfull statement in my opinion. The abyss is the harsh reality and the moving guitar melodies is the lost past innosence which is distorted again and again and again and eaten by the monster that is called real life.\n\n\nI wouln't call this album quintessential thrash, DRI's Dealing with It is quintessential. CoC are quntessential. But this is an essential album if you know how to listen to your metal. If you prefer to listen to the truth than to listen to fake shit and poser-\"music\". There is emotion in this album, it is not just a wall of sound that equally trendys and \"thrasin fuckin maniacs\" would like to view it. If you feel ready go by this album.\n",
        "\nThis is not as bad as some people make it out to be but it\u2019s not brilliant either. The guitar riffs are much more simplistic this time round and the album becomes pretty boring during the second half. Refuse/Resist is a good opener and is one of the band\u2019s most popular songs. However, it\u2019s quite obvious this is not thrash. There is a faster section before the solo that\u2019s cool but it goes back to the groove riff for the rest of the song.\n\nTerritory has some very nice drumming at the start and the rest of the song is quite good. Slave New World is one of the better songs. It\u2019s a got a faster pace to it and is a straightforward headbanger. Propaganda is closer we get to thrash and it\u2019s an enjoyable listen. The last track of note is Biotech Is Godzilla which is the fastest song on here. However, it\u2019s shorter than it could have been and it sounds more like hardcore punk than thrash.\n\nThe rest of the album is quite boring. This is where the tribal stuff really starts to rear its ugly head. It doesn\u2019t quite reach the depths of the album following this but it\u2019s already well on its way. \n\nThis is a disappointing effort. It\u2019s a far cry from the thrashing goodness of Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains and even Arise. Having said that, it\u2019s still far better than any album they did after this.\n",
        "\nWithout this album, the thrash scene would have shriveled up and died. In the year 1991, it seemed every single thrash outfit had moved on to bigger, better things (or so they thought). The Black Album, Countdown to Extinction, Sound of White Noise, and eventually Divine Intervention weren't really bad albums, but they seemed to write the epitaph of old-school thrash. A few years later Sepultura themselves would seal the tomb with the heavily tribal CHAOS A.D., but as of ARISE, they hadn't heard the news yet.\n\nThe album opens with one of the greatest and most representative title tracks in all of metal, a full on thrash assault with nary a moment for one to catch their breath, and then kicks in without pause to the opening cold chills of \"Dead Embryonic Cells\", the album's \"hit\" single. It slows it down a bit, but the thrash is still absolutely there. The crystal-clear production facilitates the headbangery.\n\nThe intro to the third song, Desperate Cry, seems to tell of a new direction the album wants to head off into, with acoustics dominating the soundscape. But as soon as the first strummed chord comes in with electrifying intensity, you know you're right back into the possessed realm that Sepultura spent the first seven years of their career creating. The thrash really kicks in a little bit later, around the minute and a half mark, and makes Desperate Cry possibly the best song on the album. \n\nThe next two songs, \"Murder\" and \"Subtraction\", continue the thrashing and are extremely memorable through their main riffs and choruses, even if one reminds the listener of the other. The album gets carried on sheerly by song strength.\n\nMax Cavalera in ARISE-era interviews often talked about the shortening of lyrics so more focus could be put on short, barked growls and especially on the instruments, and the next few songs certainly show that. The album progresses along effortlessly if not unspectacularly until you reach the closer: Infected Voice.\n\nHo-ly shit.\n\nIf you listen to that song and don't scream \"INFECTED VOICE!\" along with Max when it gets to the end of the chorus, you aren't fully enjoying the album.\n\nIn my book, the only thrash album that can top this is Megadeth's RUST IN PEACE. Sepultura continue to kick ass with a different vocalist and somewhat different sound (DANTE XXI is a return to form), but they will never top this thrashterpiece. We shall arise, Amen.\n\nBest songs: Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells, Desperate Cry, Infected Voice\n",
        "\nWell this is by far the best single that Sepultura has released. Not for the fact that the focus song is Roots Bloody Roots, but for the excellent live material added and a great cover of Celtic Frost's Procreation of the Wicked.\n\nBoth the slimcase and digipack are worth getting. The material is so great I can't decide which I prefer. Songs played live off Chaos AD (Refuse/Resist, Territory and Propaganda) sound a hell of a lot better live and the Beneath The Remains / Escape To The Void medley reminds us that even though Sepultura's then latest release was far off their original thrash sound, they could still perform their old favourites with as much passion and intensity as they did back in the day.\n\nKeep an eye out for both versions of this single. They are a must have for any Sepultura fan, or even someone who is wanting to get into Sepultura.\n\n90/100\n",
        "\nWell these were the days. Back when Sepultura were with Max and releasing singles through Roadrunner Records. I have made sure to purchase all the singles for the wonderful live tracks included.\n\nFirst off is Attitude, from Sepultura's Roots album. It is the same as the album version and provides a new turn for Sepultura with an interesting stringed percussion intro and more of an emphasis on groove metal in the rest of the song.\n\nWhilst Lookaway (master vibe mix) and Mine (feat. Mike Patton) could easily be skipped through to get to the better material, they are suitable for anyone who is able to cope with a bit of nu-metal influenced metal.\n\nKaiwas (tribal jam) is a completely overused track and is found on Chaos AD and several singles. But still, interesting to listen to if your into drums and percussion, and \"tribal\" music.\n\nNow onto the best bits of the CD. Two live songs recorded at Minneapolis in March 1994. First off is Clenched Fist from Chaos AD. Honestly, I skip this song when listening to the recorded version, but on this CD I absolutely love it. The best is saved to last, with Biotech Is Godzilla. Excellent live performance of the song with Andreas providing back up vocals in the chorus.\n\nOverall, 3 good songs and 3 average. But the last two live tracks are worth spending the small amount of money that you would pay for an item like this. Purely for the last two tracks, I spare it 50/100 and give it a 75.\n",
        "\nUnder A Pale Grey Sky\u2026 a masterpiece yet a fucking disgrace at the same time. This album is stuffed full of Roots and Chaos AD material, which will piss off most of Sepultura\u2019s fans who are more into their earlier stuff. However, a lot of this Chaos AD and Roots matieral is much more listenable live then recorded, so a bonus there. But still, it\u2019s not until track 9 when you actually hear some older thrash stuff.\n\nSo the set starts off with some acoustic / percussion intro which you may as well skip, to get to the first \u201cproper\u201d song: Roots Bloody Roots. This track is definitely the best out of the Roots material played on this CD. Then onto Spit where we actually hear Paulo\u2019s bass for once, in the intro. Sadly this is the only strong point of this song. Things then pick up with the great percussive intro of Territory, followed by a slightly faster rendition of the song which is quite pleasing.\n\nTrack 5 sees the start of some terrible covers. Max covers a spoken word song of Chico Science which luckily is only short, and transcends into Breed Apart which sounds 100% better live. Another one of Max\u2019s little percussion jams is fitted into the intro of Attitude, a track which is pretty average to my standards. The Roots material then continues on with a slightly faster version of Cut Throat played. At this point, one thinks this CD is getting rather boring, but luckily, Max yells \u201cDo you wanna hear something fucking old\u2026?\u201d Of course we fucking do. The crowd goes wild as he announces that Troops Of Doom is the next song. Iggor manages to stuff up the drums in the intro, but that doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s still a fucking great version of a great song.\n\nBeneath The Remains starts to play, with the great lead guitar riff sounding a little drowned out by rhythm guitar. It then finishes a little early and the drum intro to Mass Hypnosis starts. Mass Hypnosis, to me Sepultura\u2019s greatest song, is absolutely fucked up and wasted on this CD as it is cut short, with no guitar solo. Next off, Born Stubborn, a low point of the CD, is followed by a yet again shortened version of an older song; this time Desperate Cry. To my surprise, a full version Necromancer is then played and it sounds pretty damn good. Two more songs off Roots are played afterwards: Dusted and Endangered Species. Honestly, they are not worth even listening to.\n\nOnto CD two, which starts off with the rather Dull \u201cWe Who Are Not As Others\u201d. Some more Roots stuff is announced, Straighthate and then Dictatorshit, the latter being quite dull and the first providing some entertainment for the first half or so. The Chaos BC remix intro is played to get the crowd going before a faster version of Refuse/Resist is played, a point where the CD really picks up in interest. The Arise / Dead Embryonic Cells medley is played next, and is by far the best thrash song played on this 2 CD set. From Chaos AD, Slave New World is next and nothing too special, followed by the equally boring Biotech Is Godzilla, which is actually a good song. Just not in this recording. Track 8 to my delight started off as what sounded to be a great rendition of Inner Self. To my disappointment, Iggor went off with his blast beat and sorta ruined the intro. Otherwise, not bad.\n\nNow the CD starts to get a bit boring, with two average covers being played, Titas\u2019 Policia and We Gotta Know, with some annoying poseur dickhead guest singing. Kaiowas \u201ctribal jam\u201d is played next and is interesting for the first time, but an utter bore to listen through more than once. Experimental song Ratamahatta, off Roots, is played next and is the only Roots song on this album to not sound better live than recorded. The concert finishes off with a cover of Motorhead\u2019s Orgasmatron. Whilst it\u2019s a great improvement of the original version, it\u2019s a pretty average song to start with.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know Sepultura very well, this CD is not the one to buy. I recommend this to more faithful Sepultura fans who are able to cope with a bit of poor production and a few playing errors. Overall, there are many disappointments and a setlist which leaves a lot to be desired for, but its certainly worth listen to if you have a good interest in the band.\n\n65/100\n",
        "\nSepultura\u2019s new album is definitely faster, thrashier and less bullshit than Nation, Although this is not an epic release or as heavy as Shovel Headed Kill Machine and Sodom and is really short, Dante XXI is still a sweet, fast album that is far superior than a lot of their recent work and other recent releases\n\nThe first intro track sets up for Dark Wood of Error, which I think is just a longer intro for the far better song Convicted in Life, the dominant drum introductions in both songs are cool and start the album off fast and heavy, the singing is pretty typical Sepultura and I fight it sounds a bit more like Cavalera than Green on Nation, with the exception that Green is now so much better than Cavalera ever was, and is. The vocals are far superior to those on Soulfly\u2019s new album Dark Ages.\n\nCity of Dis is when the album slows down a little and the songs start taking on more complex, unique and interesting structure. This is still fast and thrashy, but it\u2019s a whole lot more technical and experimental than the previous two tracks. I really like the sound of the bass drum on this track. False is another song with a slower intro, turning into good half-thrash, although it\u2019s a little bit more of the same and therefore isn\u2019t really memorable. Fighting On is a lot slower than the other tracks, and almost sounds heavier because of this, you really get to hear all the notes and the build-ups / changes.\n\nIntro #2 and Ostia are two great tracks, the intro is spooky as hell and Ostia kicks in right after, although I believe the intro on the actual track could have been longer before Green started yelling. The middle instrumental section is by far the best part of this song, especially once Green ends it with his yell, that\u2019s the type of thing you love playing for pussies who don\u2019t appreciate metal, gets them every time and they whine.\n\nBurried Worlds sounds like quite a bit like nu-metal, pretty weak track, but whatever, it\u2019s not that bad. Following Burried Worlds is Nuclear Seven, I love the bass blast a la Corrupted, it\u2019s the best song yet on the album apart from Ostia. Repeating the Horror is the track that strikes me the most as old school Sepultura on the album, a good fucking thrash song. \n\nAnother Intro and Crown and Miter, good songs, the intro really works for it. Simple, fast, no fucking about, this is where the album ends for me on most of my listens. \n\nI don\u2019t listen to the last two tracks much because when I\u2019m listening to Dante XXI it means I\u2019m not in the mood for something not too complicated, and that pretty much sums the album, simple, fast and thrashy. If you\u2019re looking for something complicated to compete with Time Does Not Heal or even Shovel Headed Kill Machine, don\u2019t look here, if you\u2019re looking for an album that will assault you for 30 minutes, than this might just be for you.\n",
        "\nThis is a piece of history. Released in 1985, there was nothing around this fast, or with riffs this brutal. Not Endless Pain by Kreator, not Hell Awaits by Slayer, not Bonded by Blood by Exodus. Seven Churches by Possessed comes sortve close, but only because it had growling vocals. Bathory was probably the only band around this time that was as brutal, but they were in Sweden.\n\nThe riffs on this EP are comparable to Reign In Blood, which is pretty impressive considering that Reign In Blood was not released till the next year. The riffs are somewhat simpler occasionally. There are also a few crunching mid paced breaks and intros definitley influenced by Celtic Frost. The solos are pretty typical noise solos for Death Thrash bands around the time, and quite good for a band that had just started.\nThis EP is also probably the first recorded example of the blast beat in metal, on the song \"Antichrist\". D.R.I. had had a blast beat in thier song \"No Sense\" on thier debut (Dirty Rotten LP) in 1982, but that was more of a hardcore punk album. S.O.D. had also done a blast beat at the same time this was recorded on thier Speak English Or Die album, however this was done with two hands and without the bass drum playing at the same speed. So the first metal blast beat was on \"Antichrist\".\n\nSo on to the album sound. Production qualities are quite raw. In a listenable way, but still raw. Very good production. The bass is once more lost in the mix but whatever, same in almost every other metal band. Guitars are dark, evil, and brutal! Fast, low register tremolo picked riffs similar to Slayer, but with a much more vicious guitar tone. It is almost chainsaw like, not quite Entombed quality, but close. Guitars are excellent. The drums are simple, but fast, and done quite well, and as mentioned before, a blast beat does appear in the song \"Antichrist\". Not much double bass drum use, but overall the simple drumming does an excellent job at maintaining the brutality. The vocals are a raspy shout that is almost a growl, but not quite. Still probably the fourth harshest vocals for 1985 (1.Possessed,2.Bathory,3.Kreator). Done very well. The only thing i dont like about this EP is the intro, \"The Curse\". It sounds like somebody crapily trying to growl some evil nonsense. Quite stupid, but it has a humour value to it. Kindve sounds like the Cookie Monster...heh.\n\nThe songs are mostly all fast, with occasional mid paced breaks and intros. The best song is probably \"Necromancer\" for having the best riffs and some nice mid paced sections. However every single one of these songs is good. Really freaking awesome Death Thrash. Check it out especially if you like Reign In Blood era Slayer.\n",
        "\nIndeed, this is Sepulturas best album hands down. The riff assault of beneath the remains is absolutely crushing. This album is the best thrash fest anyone has attempted, with the most quality riffs being written and thrown down your neck like a cracked out whore being forced to inhale bleach till her death. This album as a whole is a complete riff monster with the speed and technicality that is unmatched by bands that even used \u201ctweak\u201d to aid their writing process and you know who I\u2019m talking about :). And that drumming.. oh my.. Igor\u2019s style, speed, brutality and fierceness really are an act of blitzkrieg pummeling all standing in the way. The bass definitely has its role in this album, bringing a slight side of punkishness along with the fueling of the freight train to its final destination = destruction of your mind. Max\u2019s growls are at their peak of his career with lyrical themes that are generally pretty average. Then again, who needs lyrics of vast importance when all your head hears is the whiplash of your neck as your skull takes out a wall. I could go on about how wet my panties are, but onto the songs.\n\nNothing is to be thrown away here. From the opener to the end you get a sheer quality amount of riffs that will keep your head banging for a timelessness eon. The opening riff to the title track definitely lets you know this album is out to annihilate you and your babies alike. So many riffs are thrown into the mix it\u2019s absolutely mind boggling how they could fit all of this onto a single album. The solos are a speedy electrocution of all nerve endings amongst your soul; they remain at a furious rate along side of the riffs assuring the consistency of the pace of chaos. The guitar work is all around very nice and full of relevancy; this is DEFINITELY Andreas\u2019s highlight of his career. \n\nThe second song really shows Igor\u2019s skills and really shows he deserved his old nickname \u201cSkullcrusher\u201d. The change ups in this song reign abundant with solos of beautiful fast composure showing off the song writing talent of these Brazilian maniacs. A good example of this is in Mass Hypnosis at the 2:43 break you come to the realization you\u2019re nothing but a peon in the midst of the metal gods forcing you to raise your horns to the sky before quickly returning to the overdosed status of rushing adrenaline. Slaves of Pains intro fastens your seatbelt to commence on this rollercoaster that would be one the best thrash songs ever written. The dual riffs of this song make for a lethal combo of \u201cpain\u201d and yes all of you are the slave to it.\n\nDefinitely can\u2019t go wrong with the intro to Lobotomy with Igor almost taking over spotlight of riffs overwhelming your eardrums. Ending the album is Primitive Future which gallops along like a headless horseman caused by a riff induced decapitation. This song is one last attempt to paralyze you and succeeds amazingly. It\u2019s very odd that this is the last song with a name that quite possibly is a prediction of what thrash would become after this; even for the authors themselves.\n\nOverall this album provides the heaviest, highest quantity of riffs and greatest technicality to the thrash scene. With a definite unique Brazilian aura and production quality that leaves nothing to be hindered; you can\u2019t go wrong with this album. This is probably my most played thrash album that is nearly impossible to get tired of listening to.\n",
        "\nYou know the band, so let's get straight to the songs. Please welcome, The Sepulturas!\n\nThe Curse - Spoken word intro with some bells chiming in the background. Add +1 to the necrosity and \"showing its age\" factors.\n\nBestial Devastation - Starts off with a frenetic thrash riff, then the chugging bit in the middle. It's simple, but well placed and quite bang-worthy as well. Then more frenetic thrashing. The constant drum rolls really accent the out of control nature of the song. Recommended as a means to whip dogs into a frothing killing frenzy. I like it!\n\nAntichrist - Sloppy, fast, killer, it's the simplest song here. The eerie second verse riff sounds like something off \"Seven Churches.\" The thrash break riff at 1:45 is what music critics would call \"driving\" or \"stomping,\" it kicks your ass before you are torn to shreds by a hyper blast beat and left for dead for maggots to infest your head. Enjoyable stuff.\n\nNecromancer - Holy shit. This opens with a massive crushing sludgy riff, perfectly complimented with a tom roll driven backbeat. Then it's into full on thrashing mode, with a great solo, the squeeling lead starting at 1:42 with the sparse riff underearth just plain kills everything. Then that lovely sludge riff comes back, and when the tom rolls come in at 2:24 with Max screaming \"Necromancerrr! Dead's invokerrr!\", look out your window. The sky has turned to red, it's raining toads, and armies of the undead are pouring out of fissures in the earth. Yes, this song owns THAT much.\n\nWarriors of Death - The best riffage of the EP is found here, this song really stands out compared to the others on the basis of the riffs being more developed and mature sounding (structurally however, this is pretty much the same thing as the rest of the album). We've got three distinct slowed down parts here, interspersed with thrashing. The third one sounds absolutely positively fucking EVIL with a nice tapping solo overtop of some doomy riffs.\n\nConclusion: Raw, and necro as fuck. It's also pretty damn fun! Memorable thrash breaks and good riffing all around. You can buy it on CD with something called \"Morbid Visions,\" which I gather is some sort of polka album.\n",
        "\nBeneath the MOTHERFUCKING Remains... the highlight of Sepultura's career, and - with the possible exception of a Torture Squad LP - the best thing Brasil has ever put out. \n\nthis is a riff-derived album... I say that to mean that this is not a song-based album, where you remember each individual song distinctly - nor is it a concept album where there are a few themes that come up, and those end up being the most memorable. This runs together, unashamedly so... you will remember lots of riffs, each of them pretty fucking distinct... at the very beginning a few assorted noises, and then you are grabbed by the penile vagina, or whatever other genitalia you may choose to have this particular day, thrown into a blender the size of Olympus Mons, and mercilessly beaten about the head and neck for 38 minutes. \n\nBut hey, if you want me to name highlights, I would go with the title track, and Slaves of Pain... but also Inner Self, and what a fuckbeast way of ending things with Primitive Future... or maybe Hungry (for pleasure... you act like a robot). Yeah the lyrics aren't really amazing, but I mean they're grunted out as a rhythm instrument to provide a perfect counterpoint to the riffs... check out that staccato in \"blame and lies... contradictions arise\", and then riff, riff, riff, riff, riff. Hell, even when Max is unintentionally hilarious (mass hippie-nosis!) he's pretty damn good. Such a contrast with when he would blow cocks later (Chaos AD... suck on the street!)\n\nThis is pretty much Schizophrenia Part II, except this time with better production... this album literally never slows down, it just thrashes fuck from chimpan A to chimpan Z. I've listened to this album about 8 and a half trillion times, and sometimes I still can't individually discern the songs, but play me ten seconds of this album and I will recognise it correctly: \"oh, this is Sepultura's finest moment, am I right?\" \n\nYeah, they really got this one right... there is not a single moment on this album when you are not getting skullfucked with a spike, and that's how brutal thrash is supposed to operate. Fuck, I mean they even threw in the Under the Blade riff (2:11, title track) - I mean any LP that rips off that riff (see also: Feel the Fire and Breaking the Silence) can't be bad, right? No, of course not. This isn't bad. This is electric fuck - the pinnacle of a band's creative accomplishment, before they sorta slipped (Arise) and then utterly fell off a fucking cliff (everything after that).\n\nIn short... the universe is a midget, and this album rapes it so hard that Stephen Hawking learns how to walk again. And that's all I have to say about that.\n",
        "\nWhat's left to say about Sepultura? That it's probably the best selling third world band ever? That they're going facedown to the ground since the leaving of Max \"I am the Soulfly-Ego\" Cavalera? \"Chaos A.D.\" went golden and \"Roots\" went double gold in Holland (trust me, that's a good thing). That the difference between their first and last records is so huge that even the development of a butterfly contains more radical changes? That \"Roots\" was the first piece of metal I bought? Nah, I think the band-name speaks for itself. The style on this first piece of Sepultura is totally different from \"Roots\". They started as a full-on death metal band, finding their roots on \"Beneath The Remains' (1989) and re-discovered 'em in 1991, with the release of \"Arise\". And then, five years later, one of the finest works of the 90's is released. \n\nSimply called \"Roots\", the album shows more tribal influences than a reggae-bar. Songs like \"Jasco\" and \"Itsari\" are nothing more than the drumming on a Brazilian bongo, the total opposition of the album opener, \"Roots Bloody Roots\" (who's the sinner that doesn't know this song?). \"Roots\" is a turning point in history, and possiblly the reason why other Brazilian bands (like Agresion and Retturn) decide to put a coin in the thrash-metal bag. And they can't be blamed. There is not a band which can equal the quality of a Sepultura record. Just because of the simple fact that songs like \"Attitude\", \"Spit\" and \"Breed Apart\" are so good, they'd ought tp give Max a medal!! His 'straight-in-your-face'-voice sets the tone on \"Roots Bloody Roots\" (ROOOOTS BLOODY ROOOOTS!!!!!!!) and \"Attitude\" ('Can you take it? / I won't take it!'). Then, after bursting through \"Cut-Throat\", there's a 20-second warm-up for \"Ratamahatta\". Enough time to take a glass of water and then roar along with Max and Carlinhos Brown. Following songs, \"Breed Apart\" and \"Straigthate\" are pressure-building songs, as I'd like to call them. Long songs, starting off slowly and eventually turn into a metal assault, with which you'd get your grandma deaf (that is, if she has survived the first 3 tracks). The production of \"Spit\" and \"Dusted\" could have been better. Not really surprising, not with the likes of Ross Robinson (Slipknot, Korn) working with Sepultura. \n\nThe following 2 tracks, \"Jasco\" and \"Itsari\" could have been produced by either me, you or Ross, since they're nothing more then some drumming on tribal drums, allowing you some time to get back to breath. And you'll need it, since \"Dictatorshit\" and \"Endangered Species\" are Sepultura as we known them: furious, fast metal with even more furious vocals (or should I say; screams?). Album closer, and hidden track \"Canyon Jam\" is based on the intro, but develops into some drumming that could have been recorded in some canyon, bouncing nicely away through your walls, they'll have your neighbours screaming to stop. Like with every good record. \n\nIf I wrote this review in '96, when it was released, I'd predict something like world domination, but with the loss of a mighty fine frontman in the shape of Max Cavalera, I'm sorry to say that \"Roots\" was the last Sepultura album that still proves some of the hidden quality that Sepultura had to show, since 12 years weren't enough. The world is falling apart, just several months after it's found his roots. I'm sorry.\n",
        "\nI was too young to see the reactions of metalheads all over the world when they heard this song for the first time. This was the first song that showed more groove oriented- and less thrashy riffs. Max's vocals are a tad deeper than before.\n\nWell, on to the song:\n\nIt starts out with some tribal sounding drumming and then the guitars kick in. This was sure a shock for Thrash metal fans all over the world: a groove-laden and simple single-not \"riff\", which is repeated far too often throughout the song. There are only a few different riffs in this song and ALL of them appear far too often. Remember, this is the same band that wrote \"From the Past Comes the Storms\". There are still some good things to be found here, though: Igor Calavera's drumming. He's always been a top notch drummer and he shows this fact once again. Fortunately, Andreas Kisser at least remembered how to do good solos on here. The lyrics show the more political approach that Max was heading to at that time. By no means as stupid as in Roots, but steadily going in that direction. \n\nSo, we have a Half-Thrash/Groove song which basically represents the whole Chaos A.D album. It's one of the better songs on the album, but it lacks THRASH and it lacks RIFFS. The song is still a masterpiece compared with what's to come after this...\n\nIf you like Pantera's middle era(Vulgar Display of Power - The Great Southern Trendkill) you might dig this. If you have any kind of groove, avoid.\n",
        "\nSepultura decided to release this live album in 2002, which should have been released in 1996 when it was recorded. In fact, they should have released a double live album around 1992, the same time they were making the Barcelona live VHS tape supporting Arise. There are several one time fans of this band that wouldn\u2019t have bought this in 1996 out of disgust for what they had become. There are even more fans now that wont buy this after Sepultura made an even worse turn. Yes, Sepultura is now a hardcore band, and it\u2019s sad but more than likely this is the last album Sepultura will put out that\u2019s worth the money. This was recorded in London at the Brixton, and it sounds great, sound quality-wise. They perform the huge set great, no noticeable fuckups abound (though sometimes you can hear Max\u2019s guitar drop in and out randomly, I\u2019m sure half into the second disc he was pretty tired). Max keeps the vocals strong for the most part but you can tell he\u2019s worn out near the end. Andreas gets the job done like always and belts out the leads. Paulo\u2019s bass is quiet\u2026 still. Igor is probably the most on top of things out of everyone in the band. The drums pound away and are clean and crisp. Everything seems pretty much even.\n\nThe set list is three things: Huge, dominated by Roots material, and full of covers. Oh yea, and inconsistent. The first disc starts out pretty solid even though it takes until the 9th goddamn song to have something older than 1993. Wait a second it DOES take that long. I\u2019m surprised because I was hearing some pretty cool music. Yeah Sepultura, while playing normally shit songs seems to improve and make them sound half descent. Roots Bloody Roots starts things off brutally, one of the better songs off of Roots. Spit and Breed Apart sound infinitely better live than in the studio. They make the concert one big fucking production; it was probably quite a sight to see live. Max does a little fiddling on a Brazilian string instrument for an intro to Attitude. The intro sounds awesome but it doesn\u2019t quite save the song.\nThey go from nonstop Roots material ALL the way back to the first album with Troops of Doom. They play pretty much all of the Roots/Chaos songs the same tempo as the studio but when they take a trip back they speed the shit out of the songs. What they should\u2019ve done is fucking speed up the Chaos AD songs as well so then it would be a full 23 song thrash album. Beneath the Remains/ Mass Hypnosis kind of pissed me off at first since it\u2019s so short. It would\u2019ve been so easy to play both songs but they had to cut some shit from each. Same problem with Arise/Dead Embryotic Cells. They play some more Roots shit and a shortened version of Desperate Cry which is always wonderful live. I was very pleasantly surprised when Max declared they were going to play Necromancer. It works very well live and is just as brutal. \n\nEndangered Species is completely worthless to have on a live album. They plod around for a few minutes and then we have to sit through 4 minutes of guitar feedback and a simple little hihat beat. Maybe there was something cool going on during this onstage but, I guess we\u2019ll never see that. They throw in We Who Are Not As Others and Straighthate, which aren\u2019t necessarily shippable but aren\u2019t the most interesting songs on here. They pick up the pace with the nice quick thrash assault of Dictatorshit. Then they give you a non stop thrash-fest for the next few songs. Refuse/Resist sounds brutal live (especially without any samples and shit) but they tack on some of Chaos BC to the beginning to pump up the crowd I guess. They speed it up proficiently as well. Speaking of speed, the Arise/Dead medley is a fucking fast monster that lasts all of 3 minutes. Slave New World thrashes you around for a bit, though the beginning sounds kind of stupid without the album effects, and then the insane blast of Biotech is Godzilla. Damn, Sepultura threw everything and the kitchen sink into this package. Though you can start to hear Max slow things down Igor certainly isn\u2019t as he keeps everything together perfectly.\nYES. They\u2019re starting to play fucking SCREAMS BEHIND THE SHADOWS! Son of a bitch. They fucking tease you with that riff but then\u2026 wait YES. They play all of Innerself. My disappointment is swept away. \u201cLETS DESTROY THIS FUCKING PLACE!\u201d Nothing really to say about old school Sepul-songs played live, kickass. Then things start to come to a close. They start to fuck around with some covers like Policia, We Gotta Know, and Orgasmatron. They replace the cool bass middle part in Policia with some retarded hip hop drumming and We Gotta Know has some annoying guy from Strife, whoever the fuck that is. Kaiowas works very effectively live, with lots of added percussion at the end. Orgasmatron ends everything in Motorhead fashion.\n\nMaking this album a worthy listen is no easy task. It\u2019s quite a feat for a band to take shit songs and make them listen able in a live setting. Congratulations Sepultura, you\u2019ve succeded. You\u2019re left almost exhausted after the album is done, which I\u2019m sure the whole band was. Well worry not Sepultura, now that this show is over you can go relax playing nu metal and hardcore/metalcore music for the next 10 years.\n",
        "\nThis album is pretty action packed: filled with speed and aggression. There\u2019s definitely both hits and misses on this album. Before I begin, I would say that I would rate this album lower than I did personally, because I\u2019m not all that big of a fan of the vocals, it\u2019s too choppy, and Cavelera really doesn\u2019t get creative behind a mic, but I know that most people like his vocals, so I\u2019m rating this how I think I would, should I like Cavalera\u2019s vocal capabilities.\n\nShort version: \nFast, a lot of time changes, a lot of tempo changes, some creativity, and some repetitiveness displayed. Pretty good thrash though. Drums are so-so, the guitarist I think had a lot to contribute to the album. Seems to have a lot of ideas and creativity to make songs interesting. The bassist, as far as I could hear, really didn\u2019t do anything special, but that\u2019s okay, it doesn\u2019t subtract much from the quality of the album. All in all, this album's definitely a keeper.\n\nLong song-by-song version:\nBeneath the Remains, the first song, is so-so, there\u2019s just this part that occurs a couple times where he grunts and it echoes, and it really sounds like shit. It really distracted me from the beauty of the rest of the song. It was definitely a well-written song, I give them that. Everything\u2019s right on the dot, nobody misses a beat, and that\u2019s something to aspire to in thrash, to be crazy, but tight, not sloppy.\n\nI really liked the intro to the second song, with the guitar starting out, then double bass kicking in rhythm. Not super fast or amazing by any means, but it sounds pretty damn good. It\u2019s not nearly as balls-out as the first song, they certainly toned down the speed and thrash. Towards the end it picks up a bit, though.\n\nThe fourth song, Mass Hypnosis, has an intro that really reminds me of Metallica, that is before it kicks in with some pretty fast double bass. (The double bass was just a tad bit sloppy), but it still sounded good. This song isn\u2019t bad at all. Paying attention to it, they make good use of song structure and time changes. They got really creative with the song and made something that really works. A whole spectrum of speed and style is displayed in this song. Parts are fast, some slow, some aggressive, some melodic. I really enjoyed listening to this one.\n\nSarcastic Existence is really pretty generic, until about halfway through, then the double bass is let loose. The time changes and musical style thereafter definitely make the song worth mention.\n\nSlaves of Pain has an AWESOME guitar riff for an intro. A great lead into a mid-tempo groove before they kick into high gear. The drummer didn\u2019t fare too well about forty seconds into the song. Sounds like he wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to do, but he wanted to pull off something cool and had a sight mess up in a fill. The song really is pretty cool. The guitarist does some showing off, which is great. I feel that the song does get a bit repetitive. Still can\u2019t say much about the vocals, still doin the same old shit.\n\nLobotomy has kind of a cool intro. Starts with a 5/4 beat with guitars accompanying the drums, before it goes to 4/4 time. I\u2019m probably going to interpret this wrong, what with my limited knowledge of music theory, but it sounds like it alternates from an 11/12 to a 6/6 a few times to end the intro. Whatever it is, it sounds well written and is definitely creative. This song really is a change from the others. All of the others, although different, almost sound generic, respective to sepulture, not thrash in general. This isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. Take for example about 3 minutes into the song, the drummer does a 2/4 beat with the guitar just strumming with every on/off beat. Not impressive at all. \n\nHungry had some good parts. Nothing really reached out and grabbed my attention, that was a bummer.\n\nAnd finally, Primitive Future. GREAT INTRO! Fast and furious. No doubtedly compelled thousands to beat the fuck out of each other in the mosh pits. The whole song really is really pretty fast. The guitar does some heavy riffing in this song, the drummer goes nuts with the bassist following right behind. As nerdy as this sounds, this song brought a smile to my face. It was just a perfect closing for the album, the final farewell, heavy as fuck.\n\nWell that\u2019s it, I hope you enjoyed reading my review, regardless of what you think of the album. It was a pleasure to write this for all you fellow metal-heads \\m/\n",
        "\nYes, I think this is Sepultura's finest hour. It might not have as many riffs as Schizophrenia or Beneath the Remains, but Arise has a perfect flow inbetween the songs, Max's vocals have never been so great, the acoustic parts are awesome and absolutely not cheesy and the solos are fucking lethal. \n\nThe album starts with one of the greatest thrash openers of all time: Arise\nAfter the rather intro noises, we get a kick in the face by an awesome riff which explodes into a fast, relentlessly brutal thrasher. Max's vocals kick in and together with the awesome guitars they completely kill everything. Let's not forget Igor, who's a furious beast behind the kit. Oh and that sick solo starting at 2:06...fucking lethal. Excellent song. \n\nThe next song is called Dead Embryonic Cells and while slower than Arise, it is even better. Yes, it fucking is. It's rather midpaced but the guitars are crushingly heavy, yet catchy as hell. The vocals are in perfect harmony with the guitars and the drums alone are a fantastic experience. The solo at 3:08 is totally vicious and then the track slows down and....oh my fucking god, THIS is one of the best headbang sections in Thrash. It is that good. An essential listen.\n\nThen we get Desperate Cry. \n\nStarts with an excellent acoustic intro and breaks intro a rather fast distorted guitar riff until it become an absolute headbanger of a song. And you thought this song is midpaced? At 2:09 the shreddings begins! At 2:38 comes a rather short but extremely awesome solo and the song breaks down into these beautiful acoustic guitars again until another neck-crushing part begins. The song never gets old, and all the solos in this song are fucking beautiful. Your neck should be seriously injured by now. Like the first two songs, a fucking winner.\n\nMurder. A very fitting title. Starts out very fast, sounding a little like the title track until it slows down a little. The time change after the 1:33 mark is again, a total neckbreaker. The track wouldn't be that good as if it wasn't for the solo. Even though it's rather short, it's just sweet. Still, great song, but not on par with the first three. \n\nSubtraction. Another fast-as-fuck thrasher. Oh and how great it is! It crushes along and this one really makes you thrash around like you were insane....and then the riff at 1:41...fantastic. The following speed section is nothing short of breathtaking. \n2:50 - another great solo. Kisser WAS(until he decided to throw away his talent) one of my all-time favourite guitarist. There again! 3:52, another great solo, almost as good as the first one. The \"chorus\" is great too. \"Subtraction, of personality!\" Max's trademark vocals don't even have one weak moment on this album. Another killer track.\n\nAltered State begins with a tribal sounding intro that sounds like it would come straight out of a movie. The riffs come in at 0:51. They are slow but sound extremely good and you just can't stop headbanging. Another perfect vocal performance by Cavalera. I can't stop loving Kissers lead work, ALL of his solos on this album are extremely memorable and sound absolutely great, which he shows us on this song. The clean guitars at 4:38 are beautiful once again. The riffs at 5:09 grab you by the balls once again until the song slowly fades out. Great. \n\nUnder Siege (Regnum Irae): Another track with a great acoustic intro. Then a great but slow distorted riff comes in and suddenly some great reverbed vocals kick in. After this point, the riffs get faster and Max gives one of his best performances on this album. \"Insane, Insane, Insane, Insane!\" How can you not love this? At 3:47 this song gets just so fucking great, it's like the guitars are screaming \"YOU MUST OBEY\" . Oh bloody hell, I will follow your order! At 4:11 there comes another vicious solo and it's one of the best on the album. KILLER.\n\nMeaningless Movements starts. It sounds a little generic in the beginning, but it picks up at 0:30 and turns into a decent thrasher and the short solo at 0:52 sounds very good as well. Sadly, the song isn't that memorable until the nice riff at 2:38 starts. Sadly, the solo after it is not as great as the others on the album. Luckily, a more than just decent solo makes up for it at 3:19. I dare to say that this is the weakest song on the album But that doesn't mean much on an album like this.\n\nThe album's closer \"Infected Voice\" is probably the fastest and most brutal track on the album. The opening riffsdestroyes everything on it's way. INFECTED VOICE! You just can't listen to this song without screaming along with Max. The only slowdown in this song starts at 1:57. But the song soon explodes into a thrash monster again, at 2:24. One of the fastest and sickest solos of this album. Did I already say that Kisser was god? By the last time Max screams \"Infected Voice\", you know that your neck has just been broken by an enormous amount of Thrash Metal.\n\nSadly, Arise also marked the end of an era. The end of one of the greatest Thrash Metal bands of all time. \"Chaos A.D\" was a tolerable release, but nowhere near any of their past works. Since Max left for his shitty mallcore group Soulfly, Sepultura have progressively gone worse. Every album they released was worse than it's predecessor. \n\nGet this. Seriously. This is a must for any Thrash Metal fan, or every metal fan in general. \n\nBest songs: Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells, Desperate Cry, Subtraction, Under Siege;\n",
        "\nNews Flash:\n\nWhile trekking the Amazon in search of inspiration for their newfound tribal gimmick, it seems that once-great Brazilian thrashers Sepultura caught some sort of tropical virus. Symptoms of this mysterious plague were showing themselves in the band\u2019s previous few releases, but the disease finally surfaced with the release of \u2018Roots\u2019, and has persisted in their releases ever since, showing no signs of recovery. These symptoms include thinking down-tuning is cool, and that writing suitably threatening lyrics makes up for an absence of riffs.\n\nThough having clung on to the last threads of riff sanity for the previous few years, the band was finally defeated by their condition and succumbed to the full horrors of their fate. Simplistic, ape-like groove riffs began to emerge from their once blistering amplifiers, Max Cavalera\u2019s vocals horrifically morphed into an amalgam of angsty socio-political lyrics and unconvincing anger, and they even consorted with fellow sufferers Jonathan Davies from the terminally-ill Korn and DJ Lethal of pestilent Limp Bizkit fame. Seemingly gone was Igor Cavalera\u2019s competence as a percussive force to be reckoned with, and no amount of \u201ctribal\u201d gimmicks could disguise the severity of Sepultura\u2019s decline.\n\nBafflingly, many in the wider music community hailed this release as a classic of heavy riffage and aggression, and the jewel of the band\u2019s catalogue, suggesting firstly that they have not had the pleasure of encountering any of the band\u2019s previous albums, and also that this disease is more widespread than first thought. It has been suggested that this plague is spread by such avenues as MTV and Kerrang. \n\nThis band is not the only one affected by this worrying contamination, but the common reason for its spread is thought to be DISTINCT LACK OF RIFF IDEAS. If you are in a thrash band and have been suffering from a lack of riffs \u2013 perhaps you have even started down-tuning and writing lyrics about \u201cmotherfuckers\u201d? \u2013 then don\u2019t panic, see your doctor and get him to prescribe you a liberal dosage of Kreator, Dark Angel, or other approved thrash remedies and you will be well on your way to recovery.\n\nLet Sepultura be a warning to others \u2013 if the symptoms are there, don\u2019t let the disease grow, or you will be another victim of MALLCOROSIS!\n",
        "\nWhat the fuck was I doing these past years? Something surely went wrong, since I somehow missed the brilliance of Sepultura and have only discovered it lately. Beneath The Remains is one of those albums that you buy/download/whatever and then it doesn't leave your CD player for days or even weeks. I usually don't practice that, but it seems I can't get tired of this one.\n\nAfter the great Schizophrenia, I was a bit sceptic about it's successor. I was thinking: ''Ah fuck, it can't get better than Schizo. I will just have to settle with something worse...''. But NO, Sepultura actually released a record which was equally good to Schizophrenia, if not even better. And not only that the quality was still here, the basic ideas were actually really close to the ones one it's predecessor, they were just upgraded to a higher level.\n\nThe riff ideas actually stayed the same, they just got a bit more developed. There are still a lot of mosh riffs and one not riffs, along with tons of triplets and other stuff like that. I wouldn't really say that there are more riffs here than on Schizophrenia, but something is certain: only the best ones were picked out for the songs, since there aren't any bad riffs on this record. Kisser's leads and solos are still frenetic and just a bit chaotic, staying mostly at simple scales. BUT, simple as they are, his solos are absolutely amazing. Once again, I was totally blown away by one of his solos. As it's the case in To The Wall from Schizo, Andreas' solo on Mass Hypnosis is easily one of the 10 best solos in metal ever played. \n\nThe vocals are still raspy, a little bit growly and aggressive, if maybe a bit more controlled than on previous records. Bass really isn't that audible but one really doesn't miss it with so much other stuff going on at the same time. Drums are quite diverse and there's not much more endles THUNK THUNK THUNKING to be heard. The lyrics have changed from still a bit adolescent ''evil'' lyrics on first two full lenghts, to fairly good texts mostly about politics and society.\n\nThe highlights: all of them, but if I would have to pick I would say: Inner Self, Mass Hypnosis (check out that riff and the solo - probably the best Sepultura song ever) and Slaves Of Pain, for it's great pre-chorus and actually for the whole song.\n\nYou should realy get th... Shit, I promised I would change my closing sentenses :/ Hum, what to say. Oh, yes, the skull on the cover advises you to get this or you will forevermore have to listen to Soulfly albums.\n",
        "\nDamn, this joke never gets old. Yeah, yeah, I know it ain't funny anymore. Well, to make my point clear: even though Sepultura weren't great at english, they sure were great at thrashing the hell out of everyone who bought their album or came to their show. This is often labeled as death metal, but I consider it more thrash than anything else. Sure, it certainly has some death metal elements, but after all, Sepultura started their career as a death metal band.\n\nThe only bad thing about this album is the production of it. It's muddy and unclear. It's not a major flaw though, because music doesn't suffer much because of it. Drums DO sound a bit tinny, but the guitar tone is still a killer (it's heavy, with bass turned up to 10 and not much of middle and treble, I think)! Vocals sound a bit delayed, but that only adds some additional evilness to them. Yeah, Max sounds totally evil on this one. I hate to use the term evil for a vocal performance, but it actually suits vocals on this record really well. I wouldn't really say he's growling, but the vocals also aren't pure thrash vocals.\n\nThe main quality of this record are the riffs. Oh, the riffs. The SHITLOAD of GREAT fucking riffs. There are lots of mosh and triplet riffs to be found here, but not as much on Beneath The Remains. While being brutal as fuck, the riffs manage to stay memorable and catchy. And the diversity... You probably get the picture if I tell you that there are over 40 riffs in From The Past Comes The Storms. The lead work and the solos are also remarkable. While being a bit chaotic and sloppy at times, the leads and solos on here were a high water mark for all death/thrash bands of that time. The solo in ''To The Wall'' is probably one of the best things that ever happened to metal. \n\nBass isn't really audible here, since it gets a bit drowned in the poor production. The drum work is great and it makes up for it's tinny sound. Double bass isn't overused, and the rhythms are usually played very tight. Drumming gets a bit repetitive though.\n\nThe standouts are with no doubt the riff monster From The Past Comes The Storms, with it's massive breaks and tempo changes; the instrumental Inquisition Symphony, with it's slow buildup and awesome riffing; To The Wall because of the great solo and again some great riffs.\nThere aren't any bad songs here. All of them have tons of riffs and memorability in them. Even the intro serves as a great mood maker for the following songs.\n\nDamn, another great record. You are probably all tired of my closing sentences, since they're always the same, but hell: get the album, you won't be sorry! (I promise I will come up with something new for my next review :/)\n",
        "\nI liked this a lot when I first got my hands on it, even though I always knew it was no match for anything they\u2019d done before. Time was when the whole groove thing was not such a huge commonality, so this album would doubtless have sounded better on its release than today. Not personally overloaded with it, I took quite a liking to this grooved up Sepultura who still retained plenty of the thrash temperament to keep me happy. This squarely marks a transition from their \u201cArise\u201d period to the sound found on the \u201cRoots\u201d album. It\u2019s a decent midpoint that lacks the former greatness, but also thankfully lacks the dull aching music of their next development.\n\nThe formula peaks at certain points and dips into a sludgy tedium near the end. Even though the music never sounds especially sludgy, that\u2019s the tired and muddy feel it gives off. Max is gruff as ever, and the rest of the band is enthusiastically charged up with a mix clearly emphasising the vocals and guitars. There\u2019s lots of promise as \u201cRefuse/Resist\u201d opens neatly and departs before it wears out its welcome in predictably strong opener fashion displaying qualities typical of the album as a whole, and \u201cTerritory\u201d just crushes everything in its wake with a mid paced crunch overload.\n\n\u201cSlave New World\u201d is a reasonable, if numbly reconstituted continuation of the last track and things pick up again on \u201cAmen\u201d. This song makes an admirable attempt to make a flowing atmosphere of questioning and rejection, throwing in a complementing Middle Eastern flavour during the middle. It sounds pleasingly like a Chaos A.D. variant of \u201cUnder Siege\u201d. \u201cKiaowas\u201d moulds a welcome new face for the album as acoustic guitars and tribal percussion recorded within castle walls build up an instrumental full of stirring passions. It\u2019s nice to see them further some of the hints in this direction that thinly surfaced on \u201cArise\u201d.\n\nThings then go back to basics as \u201cPropaganda\u201d is the most \u201cthrash\u201d song on the slate so far. Deliciously brutal and angry, and \u201cBiotech is Godzilla\u201d is a shorter and much quicker burst, though a sizeably more passable variant of this. A wilderness of savage sound is what dominates the rest of the album, taking its cue from \u201cNomad\u201d. Like an animal lying in wait stalking its prey, the rest of the album takes its sweet time in prowling through each song. It does sound interesting and workable, but could potentially swing either way and goes both. As more tribal overtones and harmony guitars flurry around the mostly instrumental \u201cWe Who Are Not As Others\u201d the album could just come to a satisfactory close and wouldn\u2019t have lost a thing.\n\nThey decide they want to pad out the running time with a bit of filler however, and a break into more upbeat tone with a New Model Army cover is still tiresome. They try to go all experimental in doing a narrative passage to the music in \u201cManifest\u201d, but it ends up dry and without any creative fuel in its engine; plodding and directionless. They also do some really silly shit at the end after (same old story) \u201cClenched Fist\u201d, doing inane laughs and noises for a couple of minutes (ones for the end of the instrumental earlier) that I really don\u2019t want to hear. Apart from this, while it\u2019s not \u201cArise\u201d by any means it\u2019s still quite enjoyable and is to me their last good release before they hit rock bottom.\n",
        "\nOne listen to this album and its immediately shown some kind of diabolical change has occurred in the past couple years. Arise was a bit of step down from Beneath the Remains but it was still fucking fast and had some nice riffs packed in every song. You wouldn\u2019t expect both elements be gone with this release but alas. Now the production is really good on this album which is one good thing. Igor is on top of his game now that the music is so slow it gives him room to be really creative. Max\u2019s voice sure kind of took a little spill though not to mention the absence of all good riffs. I guess they used so many good riffs in the last three albums they got drained. At best this album is slightly thrashy and when it\u2019s bad it\u2019s horrible. Like Amen with its boring as fuck slow plodding riffs and the industrial touches they\u2019ve thrown in. But it\u2019s still better than some give it credit for. Manifest is still a nice fast addition. The first three songs are pretty good as well.\n\nIt starts with a usual \u2018noise\u2019 type opener but wait instead of a beautiful thrash riff there comes in this alien industrial garbage. Surely after that maybe a decent thrash riff should come in. Not really just a mid-tempo forgettable riff. Now this song would be a lot fuckin better by itself but no this is Sepultura this should be a whole lot more. Well it speeds up with a great section for a good solo which definitely saves it, but slows itself back down again and ends with the same effects it began with. Holy shit Territory starts out impressive. Or I should say Igor Calavera does. Nice tribal drums and the guitar comes in, this seems like its going to be quite enjoyable. Goddamnit it slows down again. But its still is a nice brutal riff complemented with equal drums. Slave New World starts out with an ok mid tempo riff and well stays that way throughout the song. Again nice drumming. Ouch, Amen is just shit. Very slow, uninteresting music with some weird tribal voice sections thrown in. Kaiowas is well\u2026 interesting. Nothing to wrong with experimenting but this is supposed to be a thrash album. It\u2019s done with acoustic guitars and Brazilian percussion. They pull it off well live though. Propaganda is an all right song though I\u2019m dying to thrash though it never quite makes it. Once it starts it sounds promising enough (except Max\u2019s lyrics, I mean come on \u201cWhy don\u2019t you realize that your fucked up!!\u201d) but becomes boring after a few listens. Biotech is Godzilla is a super fast song but is kinda silly and doesn\u2019t quite sound like Lobotomy or anything. Nomad is another plodding slow song that would be boring but somehow remains interesting with the riffs. Manifest is one of faster songs on the album is probably the highlight but could\u2019ve been better without the industrial crap. The Hunt is a forgettable cover. Clenched Fist starts off horribly and doesn\u2019t get any better until about 1:39 where it gets really nice and thrashy. Really stupid lyrics; every time Max says \u201cSoul! Mind!\u201d I get a sinking feeling in my gut how close that is to his \u201cSoul Fly!\u201d yelling.\n\nThe reason this album seems so bad at first is because it followed some of the best thrash albums around. But after listening to Roorback you\u2019ll think this was Beneath the Remain.\nHighlights: Territory, Manifest, and well those are the only essential tracks from this one.\nIf you like Roots you\u2019ll probably like this, otherwise you will be disappointed.\n",
        "\nThe first time I heard Sepultura was when I got \"The Heart of Roadrunner Collection: We Make Metal Mallcore!\"* And heard the blatantly horrible if not sadly catchy song \"Roots\". \n\nTwo years later I show up at my local music store and notice a Sepultura CD for a few bucks. Without bothering to look at it I grab it along with some other loot. Turns out I purchased a 3 song single \"Dead Embryonic Cells.\" It's a good thing that this album sounds nothing like \"Roots\", or else I would have been very ticked off.\n\nThe three songs on here are examples of nearly perfected executions of death/thrash metal. As mentioned in my Death \"Individual Thought Patterns\" review Sepultura was one of the pioneers of death metal. This single is from the album \"Arise\" which was one of Sepultura's earlier albums, before they decided to ride the mallcore train to the land of cash grab.\n\nAll of the instruments on this album meld together in near perfect unison. The guitar playing is excellent considering that Max Calvara has mentioned in a certain magazine interview that he has no idea what the guitar strings are called, and enjoys writing songs around \"the big string.\" For someone who's able to play the guitar he sure doesn't seem to know shit about it.\n\nI do have a theory though; the Max Calvara that played in later Sepultura and Soulfly is not the real Max Calvara. It's actually a clone of the real Max Calvara who's taken a nice long vacation somewhere else.\n\nSeriously, you cannot play the guitar as well as Max did on this single and then have no idea what certain parts of the guitar are called later on in life unless A) You're suffering from amnesia or B) you're actually a clone of the original person, or C) you're just completely stupid.\n\n*sighs*. I digress though, the past is the past. This is a single in which Max Calvara could play his guitar quite well. The drums were performed with crystal clarity and precision, the bass was still being used a low end instrument and didn\u2019t do anything fancy, and the vocals were guttural thrash style vocals.\n\nIf you like thrash and death metal then you\u2019ll enjoy this single. Of course if you own the album \u201cArise\u201d then buying this would be rather pointless and stupid, unless you\u2019re one of those fans that has to collect everything by Sepultura. In that case I say knock yourself out.\n\nThis is early death metal melded with thrash at it\u2019s finest. It gets a score of a 91 because I don\u2019t see this album as the perfect death metal/thrash metal album.\n\nThrash/Death Sepultura was so much better than nu-metal Sepultura. RIP\n",
        "\n\"Choke\" may be one of the strongest songs off the \"comeback\" album by Brazil's most successful metal import. The big chorus, intimidating lyrics/vocals and winding riffs hammer along nicely and show that life might have been possible after Max Cavalera. Unfortunatly...this would be one of the few good tracks on the record. Even worse, it would be one of the few good tracks written by this line-up period. The accompanying cover track and demo of \"Against\" (another one of the few great thrashers) are also good listens. If you can track this down...it's worth the listen.\n",
        "\nVery good home vid. Although I'll always remember this band as being the Brazilian thrash mongrel that was once fronted by Max Cavalera, its been almost a decade now that he's split and neither him nor his former bandmates have been able to accomplish anything that even remotely resembles greatness.\nThis video did however manage to capture Sepultura back in their glory days when their roster of songs was all meat and no filler. The set list that is utilized during this show is absolutely awesome and will certainly appeal to all the old school Sepultura fans of the late eighties and early nineties.\nOne thing that I must mention is some of the changes that have been made to certain parts of the songs. Changes for the better I might add. Check out the way the band shred's through the intro to Escape to the Void, matched by the double bass patern that Igor puts to use. Far better than what is heard on Schizophrenia.\nThere are also some unintentionally humorous moments, like during the intro to Hypnosis, Max tries to entice the crowd by getting them to chant in broken english...mass hippie noses. Sorry no apologies, I find that kinda funny. As far as the lighting is concerned, its generic at best and nothing spectacular is derived from the lighting. Certainly very little thematic elements seem to be prevalent.\nThe sound quality is excellent, and the if you buy this baby on DVD, then you even get the option for surround sound 5.1.\nThe only real let down as far as I'm concerned is the lack of accuracy on Andreas' part when it comes to the solos, he does do a decent job however, he gives this video the Glen Tipton syndrome, which basically means if you can't pull it off live, then don't put it on an album.\nWith that one slight pitfall aside though, this video is rather entertaining, and some of the interviews with the band members between the songs is very interesting, in which they discuss some of the bands history as well as the hardships that are endured living on streets and growing up in Brazil.\n",
        "\nI was a big fan of Sepultura up to Roots. I loved everything they did and although Roots was definately not as good as an album like Arise, it at least has some quality in it. The fact of the matter is this: Sepultura are simply not the force they once were and have become terribly watered down like so many other great bands before them have done. In the same way Metallica went downhill, Sepultura have done the same, just in their own way. No longer are they the powerful thrash/death pioneers that they were on Beneath the Remains or Arise. All the band is now is a terribly boring mess of some of the most watered down \"metal\" with a terrible vocalist that attempts to scream. I really can't see how people can enjoy Derrick Green's vocals. They put me to sleep the first time I heard them. Unfortunately Sepultura seem to have decided to take a more basic route and it definately is not for the better. \n\nThe album's opener \"Sepulnation\" does nothing to grip the listener and displays a new weak sound in all aspects of the music. The production is just bad and adds to the boredom already displayed by the music. Bad riffs, chorus, and vocals already set up the entire album on the first song. Igor Cavalera's drumming is okay on this album but it is certainly nothing in comparison to Sepultura's old albums. Overall, Nation just simply drags on monotonously, doing nothing to impress the listener. Boring riffs with terrible guitar sound, bad scream vocals, and production that seems like it was made to put listeners to sleep all add up to make one hell of a boring album. Jamey Jasta from Hatebreed makes a guest appearance for thirty seconds on a pretty pointless one minute song called \"Human Cause,\" doing nothing to make things more exciting. Some reggae dude also does vocals on \"Tribe to a Nation\" which just results in an awful mix between reggae and bad watered down hardcore/\"metal.\" There is no reason to make anybody interested in listening to this album unless they are some pot-smoking liberal that accepts any music that talks about protesting as good music. \n\nNation is just another album that shows Sepultura will probably never be the band that they once were. This is too bad because they have made some classic albums in the past and yet have resulted in something so terribly boring. I don't know if this is because Max left the band to form Soulfly (which I think is even better this new Sepultura) but it doesn't matter because they most likely will not turn back to their previous ways. Nation will disappoint most fans of the band's older style. However it's also hard to see people into hardcore or even nu-metal getting into this album just because of how boring it is. Anyway, Nation is not reccomended unless you have no taste in music.\n",
        "\nChaos A.D:\n\nAs many critics of this album said, this record put down the basic lines of mallcore, due to the progressive commercialization of thrash metal (Pantera and all the anti-\"post-thrash\" sellouits theories are the main example of this campaign of hatred, which is unfair confronting to all the gems Pantera offered to the main thrash current.) \n\nI've never been a Sepultura hardcore, but I still had appreciated the Arise album. This didn't made me feel Chaos A.D. was crap. The variety of the grooves (I hate talking about \"grooves\", but anyhoo!) makes it an experimental album on an experimental path, which will lead to the horrible stuff Sepultura get around right now. \n\nSomehow, I could still recognize an incredible skill of Igor behind the drums; the touch of tribalism put on the songs, with plenty of wooden bells, samba-like percussions and stuff like this is an improvement, not necessary but at least not annoying. Max, to my opinion, has made the choice to seem never-endingly growling, and I wouldn't blame him for his eventual technical limits. Guitar riffs are quite heavy, with small solos and power strums, in Sepultura style...which means they're always the same. This leads to have all the tracks with identical riffs, but plenty of different rythms and stuff added to not make you see the riff is the same from the previous song.\n\nMaybe it's compensation for Arise, when the drums were always the same and the riffs changed play by play.\n",
        "\nArise is usually seen as \"the\" thrash album of Sepultura, but this affirmation is countered by facts; all the elements make hard to distinguish Arise from a death metal album, that make this product far from ages by the magnificience of thrash as Slayer's \"Seasons in The Abyss\" in terms of solos and technical application, to a more brutal and constant sound that better recalls the atmospheres of death metal rather than the refined and razor-shaped sound of thrashing contemporaries like Slayer.\n\nThis obsessive role is played most by drums, that are continously forced into a combinations of 16th or 32th notes that may be sintetized by a too-pah-too-pah-too-pah-too-pah-dish, repeated to nausea at 170-180 bps and somewhere delayed by an occasional roll. For my pleasure, I'm habit to Lombardo's skyrocketing accompainment, so I have a weird sensation listening all the songs starting with the combination intro riff/little roll/too-pah-too-pah... and this for ALL the entire play. \nI don't find this negative, I love this kind of stuff and I would listen the same drumline for hours, and I actually do it. But when the too-pah-too-pah comes to annoy me, it means it's enough to wear off all the kids that aren't so heavy-minded like me.\n\nThe guitars are pretty cool, and they're the way to distinguish one song from another, though they don't have great exploits in solos, due probably to the economy of songs than the technical limit of Andreas. The singing is in the usual Cavalera-style, that isn't bad if you want growls all along the way.\n\nSomehow, despite the review I'm doing - you bet it isn't positive, dude? - I have to say I like this album. The right atmosphere to make the people realize they're truly in front of Apocalypse, and it's time to headbang, because we're doomed.\n\n(I hope that era of destruction never comes...)\n",
        "\nBeneath the Remains is a very under-rated album by a very under-rated band. Sepultura is a Brazilian thrash band in the vein of Slayer and Testament(Both bands I whom I highly recommend.).Alot of people see Sepultura as a band with very little talent, that doesn't compare to bands like Slayer and Metallica, but I beg to differ. And that's what makes the U.S. great, freedom of speech. Anyway I think that as musicians they lack musicianship compared to bands like Slayer and Morbid Angel. That's just not where Sepultura's abilities lie. Sepultura's talents are their abilities as composers. Take for example Andreas Kisser, his guitar solos always seem to fit almost perfectly in every song. They are melodic, written in classical scales, and fast just like the rest of Sepultura's music. Andreas's riffs are real head movers to. They are just so catchy yet brutal, they are Slayerish but more sludgy/groovy. If these riffs don't get your head banging you must be paralyzed. The most moshable tracks are probably \"Inner Self\", and \"Primitive Future\" witch is probably the most energetic song on the album. \n\nNext we have Igor Cavalera who just pulverizes his drum kit. He pounds those things with all his might, and creates thunderous sounds that Zeus would be jealous of. He is also pretty tight. Most drummers don't catch my attention because I usually focus on the guitars. But Igor is just so loud, and and his technique is so catchy my attention is just swayed over to him alot of the time. If I was a drummer this is what I would sound like.\n\nThere's really not much to the lyrics they are the same old tongue in cheek anti-war lyrics you get from many a metal band. But Max Cavalera(Brother of Igor.) the vocalist/rythm guitarist has a very strong, and masculine voice, and you know he means buisness.\n\nThis album is near perfect it's heavy as all hell(This must sink in.), there is no filler, and almost no throw away riffs/lyrics. Despite all that, it lacks originality so I can't give it a 100% rating. But I can say this, if you're a fan of brutal thrash at all, you must give this a trial listen.\n\nHighlight tracks include: \"Beneath the Remains \", \"Inner Self\", \"Lobotomy\", and \"Primitive Future\".\n",
        "\nWell, we all know it's not Arise, nor BTR or Chaos A.D. all of those 3 classics had something that no other band had. those efforts stand close, really close to the ultumate combination of thrash metal with a tons of varied elements - from hardcore and punk influences, to tribal jamming.\n\nBut after lord Cavalera has left storming the band, the ever known as \"Not as good as Max\" Derrek green (a.k.a as the colored fellow).\nBut Chris rock said it best when he said \"Jesus is black !\", cuz Derrek Green never sound better in his whole career as he sound in Roorback.\nLifting from the album from the top - with the anti-war \"Come back alive\" shines an extremely non-cynical view of war-crisis - all moshed with a groovie laydown and thrashy guitarwork. Igor is still Igor - pounding on his skins like a whole tribe of drummers, and Green shouts his throat out to the craspy no-return point.\n\nThe problem with the album is that it's too unstaddy in it's composition level and it's thrilling points. there several good songs, some avarge songs that are cool for first listenning, and some bad songs that ain't worth even the first listen - all is deployed in the unreasonable sound-choise mixdown.\n\nSepultura - never again the same thrash metal phenomena of the late 80's, are forever middled in the groove-oriented hardcore to metalcore musical approach, yet insted of choosing some juisy sound of the guitar as Machine-head or Fear-factory, they chose the thrash-metal thick like a bone guitar sound - which could be working perfectly if they were still playing thrash metal !\nThe only two songs the mixing gives a good point are the thrashy ones. \"Currupted\" resemble a version of Slayer's \"Criminaly insane\" with a hard-core twist after the middle - reminding the faster cuts of Chaos A.D. like Refuse/Resist.\n\"Activist\" is another Chaos A.D. like fast-song - short and catchy. Sepultura are never tired from their political lyrics - but they need some writer with the wit of Warrel Dane to give their wicker track an understandable textual approach.\n\nSome good metalcore songs here, anyway - that uphill the Roots-to-Nation era - like \"Mind war\" with a charming C-part and \"More of the same\" with a calm bridge. Imagine Killswitch engage only in the Sepulturial way.\n\nNot a bad album, but far from Excellent.\n",
        "\nRiffs...oh YEAH!! Damn this album has riffs. These riffs slay. These riffs kill! In fact, these riffs can be used to conquer small third world countries. If Russia had had Schizophrenia, the balance of power would've been shifted in their favor (if they knew how to use it). Someone once played this album, and then Kabutu in Congo was ousted by a coup. Coincidence? I think not..\n\nAll kidding aside, these riffs actually don't stand that strong in isolation. Rommel's panzers weren't victorious on their own either. No, you've got to pummel the enemy (bass&drums) before you can roll over them with your massive guitarriffs. Some psychological warfare (the violin intro at the start of the album, and the occasional acoustic intro) does wonders as well. Alternate your gruff vocals of mad despair with insanely intense guitarsolos, and the road to Tobruk is open.\n\nAnd once there, you unleash the single perfect thrash metal song in existence, the 7 minute 16 long instrumental Inquisition Symphony..\n\nTroops of Doom make for welcome reinforcements, although it's included on multiple other albums. The rough mixes and the demoversion of 'The Past Reborns The Storms' don't offer much. They're even rougher around the edges than the rest of the album, and that's saying something.\n",
        "\nSepultura joined in on this split was the vastly unknown \"other\" band and put together a brutal display of violence that put them on the map of what was considered \"extreme metal\" at the time. The swirling guitars, howling barks that pass for vocals and the heavy-handed drumming all spin together to create a massive vortex of violence previously unseen by any band from their geographic area.\n\nFor me, this is some of the bands best material, they hammered in a black metal styled bashing in the vein of early Sodom and Slayer with only half the production and melody. Even so, it works well to bring forth the entire concept of chaos that was to be Sepultura.\n\nIt's too bad that within the next ten years the band would be an entirely different animal that would nearly forget the work that was created on the early releases.\n",
        "\nSepultura are my favorite band of all time and Im fuckin happy to see that they're improving very fast with Derrick and I'm sure that they''ll be totally awesome on their upcoming cds (they kick Soulfly's ass anyway :)) This DVD simply kills. \n\nThe first part is a gig from Arise tour - their best, most perfect and beautiful record (one of the best metal records ever). First the setlist - its crazy!! All my favorite songs are there (except of Subtraction and Meaningless movements :(( ), including incredible Altered State. And the all-time classics like Arise, Inner Self, Troops of Doom, Beneath the remains...actually, there's no point in enlisting my favorite tracks here, because they all kick ass :D\n\nThe quality is outstanding. Frankly, it may seem that it was recorded yesterday! The sound is extremely sharp and heavy - and so are the visuals. What I like most about the visual part of the video is how Sepultura act on stage - its AWESOME!! When I see what Max does now with Assholefly - just standing in front of the mic and playing those powerchords... Its just incomparable! Headbanging, jumping, even destruction of the instruments - its all there. The band is having fun and you can see that they are very close to their audience. What is more - they play very accurate - even Max who now got numb as a guitarist, is playing his parts with great focus while \ngiving his best on stage at the same time! Everything is great - vocals, solos, drums, bass... Jawdropping video. \n\nThe second part contains some less known songs like Policia played live, all \nthe videos from Chaos A.D. and pretty cool interviews with the band. Being \na fanatic of Sepultura's music, I enjoyed this part especially, but it contains \nsome cool live footage for everyone.\n\n\"We are what we are\" is a set of clips from Roots cd with some comments about them. Nothing really special, but the quality is very good as well and this videos are fun to watch.\n\nAll in all - the first part itself gives this rating, but the remaing two do not disapoint and just can't change the mark. If you're not a die-hard Sepultura fun, decrease this rating by, say, 5%. It's an awesome performance for every \nmetalhead.\n",
        "\nThis must be a complete joke, right? After Arise, which had plenty of groove but also plenty of riffs, they put out... this?? This doesn't even function well as punk rock, it's that sloppy and that careless and that seemingly done without regard to making music. \n\nWhat this can be described as best is a vocal track over random instrumentation, where the two are entirely disjoint and appear to have been recorded in separate studios. Instrumentally, the whole damn thing sounds like one really long intro to a thrash album, with the slow riffs that come in and any minute now - really, any time now, come on folks, you expect this to blast out into some screaming riffage.\n\nThe closest thing that this comes to screaming riffage is the intro to Slave New World, which is a bit above midpaced, and for the most part sounds like a punk rock song... not quite thrash enough to be thrash, but at least it doesn't sound like someone is trying to pass a bowel movement. \n\nThe rest of the album... yep, it's pure defecation. Including Max's constipated vocals being mixed far too loud in the mix... these aren't death growls; these are random barks. And they are about 9dB too loud for anyone's good. All you hear is this megalomaniac asshole talking with his funny accent, like a badly designed Hitler making a badly designed speech.\n\nDAS!\n\nEST!\n\nGUT!\n\nThe whole FUCKING album sounds like that. Believe me, it's funny for the first ten seconds or so (Chaos AD, tanks on the streets!) but then you start wondering if the whole thing ever turns into anything musical, ever.\n\nAside from the brief moments here and there, the answer is, no it does not ever turn into anything musical. The only digressions from the random Machine Head sounding half-Pantera riffs (does that make them quarter-thrash??) are silly instrumentals like Kaiowas - that little acoustic guitar bit sounds more Fleetwood Mac than anything else, except Fleetwood Mac didn't sound like a 33rpm LP stuck on repeat, ever. And I can still hear you saying, you - and I can still hear you saying, you - and I can still hear you saying... OH AND TURN THOSE FUCKING DRUMS DOWN.\n\nOh yeah, the cover of The Hunt? Everyone calls this a highlight... the only thing that's any good about it is that the vocals are turned down a bit, and it's a bit more catchy than the rest; but not nearly enough to make it any memorable.\n\nComplete shit here from the cunts of Brasil. Again, I don't think this is a serious record. Like Bathory's \"Octagon\", they probably thought that people would - given the quality of the first four albums - buy anything with a 'Sepultura' tag on it.\n\nWell, don't buy this shit. It's completely without value. Good grief, it's worse than the first Machine Head album. There's pretty much nothing catchy here - not the opening riff to Refuse-Resist, not anywhere else. Okay maybe the first few seconds of Manifest (before they get into the random stupidity), and about half of Slave New World, but come on, even Regurgitated Cow Fetus could come up with a minute and a half of thrash among forty-eight minutes of pure shit.\n",
        "\nSepultura kicks it into high fucking gear here, issuing their edict that THIS is how to play heavy fucking metal, and ya know what, I'm game, I'll listen. This is 1986, where pretty much thrash comes to a boil, and both the good and the bad aspects of it are polarised and appear in mass quantities... I won't dwell on the bad (let's just say that it is anally expelled by Danish trolls), but note the good. Pleasure to Kill. Reign in Blood. Darkness FUCKING Descends. The unholy trinity...\n\nAnd then, just on their heels as far as influence, and completely as good, is this album... similar to the second Possessed, in that it's not nearly as out-there as the album (or EP) that preceded it, but still competely extreme and still completely fucking metal. This is pretty much straight-up thrash metal, a la Schizophrenia, but with the death-metal necro vestiges of Bestial Devastation sometimes quite prevalent, mainly in the production values and also the occasional off-kilter drumwork (those toms are mixed rather loud). The production kinda blows ass, being neither here (necrotic chainsaw-gougings in the vaginal region, a la Bestial Devastation) or there (precise bludgeoning trauma wounds to the neck and face, a la Schizophrenia), but the riffage is top notch.\n\nSongwriting follows a basic style... similar to the EP in that just about every song is fast, then slow, then fast again - the thrash breaks are very crisp and very clean and very overt, and Nuclear Assault is the only other band I can think of that drops to 50-75% speed this consistently and this effectively. Throw in Max's narration - he says \"thrash!!!\" in at least three songs, and we've squarely identified the genre.\n\nHighlights... War is basically a sloppier version of Escape to the Void (especially in the pattern of the vocal delivery), and Mayhem has that nifty middle break, which is probably the best of all of them out here... Morbid Visions has a damn catchy four-note riff that comes in just enough times to leave you wanting more... \n\nSome of the songs sound really damn similar - check out the intros of Troops of Doom and Funeral Rites for example. Troops of Doom, incidentally, is not all that different from the Schizo version, other than the production values. Both are raging thrash beastfucks of the highest order. \n\nAnd yes, Crucifixion does have a random silly Latin passage... and that final outro to Empire of the Damned is just plain hilarious - but hey, they were 17, they can't be blamed for not having any idea of what is correct... this album doesn't sound very much like anything else out there, and for that they must be commended. Staple thrash metal. Along with the next two LPs by this band, and maybe even the one after that, this one is recommended.\n",
        "\nbut I like Anticop. I'm not sure why; maybe it's because the drums aren't quite so random-sounding as in Antichrist.\n\nYep, Antichrist is fucking necro as Hell, and is probably the most egregious example of sloppiness on this entire album... the insane, yet somewhat gratuitous, middle section that slows down a la Artillery or Overkill... then the really fucking fast necroblast section, which is pretty damn innovative for 1985, and of course the cheesy lyrics, both here and there. \"Stick that gun up your ass\" versus \"slaughter the Christian's born\". Neither can be mistaken for \"Do Dark Horses Dream of Nightmares\"... so we're gonna call it a draw.\n\nHow's the rest of the album? Because Antichrist is still a pretty cool song... the production is actually better than Morbid Visions (the Sepultura full-length that would follow this EP)... the intro is cheesy as fuck, and borderline hilarous... Satanas is invocative to destroy!!\n\nThen we get the riffage. Oh fuck yes, Bestial Devastation is a great song. Check out that headbangage riff in the middle... Sepultura would turn this into an art form later, with songs like From the Past Comes the Storms and Slaves of Pain, and here it first rears its ugly head. Necromancer (dirty fucker!) is more of the same, as is Warriors of Death. Pretty much all the songs here follow the same formula. Fast section. Slow section. Fast section. Antichrist is the most overt about it, though Warriors of Death is the slowest of the slow, and even throws in a (what's this!) melodic solo... sometimes the drums are more noisemaker than beatkeeper (see aforementioned Antichrist, or the random fills that come in in, for example, Bestial Devastation). But the guitar tone is nice and evil, and the riffage is pretty tight, and for 1985, this is pretty fucking revolutionary.\n\nRecommended? Certainly. It's available as a really common re-release with Morbid Visions, a demo track, and of course \"fuck the police\", which makes no sense whatsoever in the context of the rest of the works, but hey, it's still a fun song.\n",
        "\nFor first Sepultura studio album since a chaotic system of changes this could have been much worse, but on a musical level aside from these recent disasters it could also have been a lot better.\n\nThis CD is a sloppy affair albeit bearing some key moments of brutality that only Sepultura can bring forth. The hammering strains of the title track, the grunting \"Choke\", the good refrain of \"Old Earth\" and the catchy refrain of \"Rumors\" all worthy of a second listen. The production is clear and crisp, the instrumentals make for a great mood leaving the rest to be \"ok\" metal-slop that bears little in the way of hooks or memorable riffs. (It's angry and brutal in most spots, but hardly life changing.)\n\nOh yeah, the fact that this is the first album without founding memeber Max Cavalera on vocals/second guitar is also to note. Our new frontman has a bigger range and a voice with more diverse qaulities than Max but lacks Max's intensity and aggression. He is \"brutal\", but he is hardly amazing or so unique. He is a sheer case that sometimes \"range\" cannot replace personality - though he does as good a job as any replacement of such an important member could be.\n\nMax is out, the new guy is in and nobody really cared. Record after record would see the once popular act losing considerable amount of respect, sales and attention over the years. The music with Max may have been on a quick decline, but this is nearing the bottom of the total affect that Sepultura could have produced.\n\nWithout Max they have no hope of commercial success, one wonders though, that even with Max that the artistic goals might also be a struggle to reach despite his island-core-metal-hybrid having a least some sort of hook or direction.\n\nBoth Max and Sepultura would find themselves in an artistic mess at this juncture...sadly...only one could keep the fans and while this record sold well on curiosity the end result was a band in free fall. A fall that continues to this very day.\n",
        "\nYou have to wonder what happened between Schizophrenia, a thrash masterpiece, and this album, which is as mediocre as they get. \n\nSchizophrenia had riffs that slew. Beneath the Remains is full of riffs that I've heard a zillion times on other thrash albums. And for an album released in 1989, that's not a good thing. This album is full of the oh-so-typical dundundundun-du-da-du riffs, with the various songs having various variations thereof. The guitars are accompanied by the same sort of drumming that typified the drumming on Schizophrenia, only this time because of the lack of intense and interesting guitar-riffs, it's a mis on the hit-or-mis scale. The vocals still carry part of the intensity that the vocals on the previous album had, the intensity of a group of people in a desolate place desperately seeking a way out, but apparently the possible real-life breakthrough abroad at that time adversely affected this. I miss the madness in the music, the raw emotion, I miss something as epic as the Inquisition Symphony. I miss the attitude the liner notes on this re-release speak of.\n\nIt's not all bad, and in all honesty this Sepultura album is moderately better than the 'average' thrash album, but only marginally so. The album just goes right past me after I put it on. It doesn't seperate itself from other thrash. The album, like each song seperately, lacks it's own atmosphere. It's such a huge dissapointment for a band that released both Arise and Schizophrenia. I can't blame the crispier production, as they thankfully found themselves again on the next release.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve always thought that cover albums can be a sort of hit and miss affair, which is why I was glad to see Sepultura hit the nail right on the head with their attempt, \u2018Revoulsongs\u2019. Featuring such classics as Hellhammers\u2019 \u2018Messiah\u2019, Jane Addiction\u2019s \u2018Moutain Song\u2019, and even U2\u2019s \u2018Bullet the Blue Sky\u2019, this EP has a nice array of songs. From fast and heavy \u2018Messiah\u2019, to the thrashing punk song \u2018Mongoloid\u2019 to mostly slow, memorable \u2018Bullet the Blue Sky\u2019 the listener\u2019s sure to find plenty on offer. \nIt\u2019s hard to make good assessment on an album like this unless you\u2019ve actually heard most of the originals. I must admit that I haven\u2019t heard them all, but what I can support is the fact that the songs are all well executed, showing off all of the member\u2019s talents and strengths. I was especially surprised by Derrick Green\u2019s vocals on tracks like \u2018Messiah\u2019 and \u2018Angel\u2019, where he shows that he can actually put on a display of heavy vocals, something not always obvious on this EP, or any of his work with Sepultura for that matter. Andreas Kisser plays guitar with the best of them, Paulo Jr. shows that the same can be said for him on his bass and Igor Cavalera executes the songs on hand with absolute perfection. All that coupled together with some great songs, I\u2019m sure that any Sepultura fan, or even anybody that\u2019s musically diverse, can find lots to satisfy themselves with. But, I do have one complaint with this EP, the cover of \u2018Black Steel In the Hour of Chaos\u2019. If you can look past the scratches and rap, which is at one point is in the band\u2019s native language and at another done with heavy vocals, then your enjoyment won\u2019t be hindered in the least.\n",
        "\nThis EP is a fine display of blackened death, that for 1985 is pretty well ahead of it\u2019s time, and just goes to show what a comprehensive career sepulture has had. Yes, these are indeed humble beginnings. It is full of things Necr0 and Grim, and as said in my previous sentence, in it\u2019s day material like this would have been uncommon, if not, original for.\n\nComparisons will have to be made to a band by the name of Hellhammer. Primitive, raw black metal, crossed with a little death, composed before either genre was really anything substantial. Riff work that is generally sloppy in the Venom/Hellhammer vein, a total buzzsaw guitar tone, lyrics that would put Venom to shame, and a generally evil ambience that bands such as Mayhem and Darkthrone aimed to and did achieve. \n\nIn addition to this, all extreme metal at the time inevitably showed signs of thrash, as this would be the building block for both death and black metals, so too does this album. \n\nSo this album is of significant historical importance in the progression of black, death and thrash. I have the re-issued version that was released with the Morbid Visions LP, it\u2019s fairly awesome.\n",
        "\nWhat a tremendous piece of thrash work! This is an excellent album in the vein of Reign In Blood Slayer, as Max Cavalera (vocals, guitar) and Andreas Kisser (guitar) shred in the same vein as Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Max Cavalera almost never sings, but his shouty vocals give the album an agressive feel. And fast and heavy is the norm for the drums. Expect mosh pit and headbanging joy with this one, kiddies, because this album rips.\n\nThe title track opens with eerie sounds like what you would here if you played Doom or Half-Life most of your life, before working into very fast guitar and drumming. Musically, it sounds a little like \"Angel of Death\". \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" covers the topic of stem cell research, long before it would go on to become a hotly debated topic in the news in the late-90's. Musically, there are tempo shifs in this song - especially toward the the middle of the song before the last verse. The chug riff in the middle of \"Cells\" is a true headmover. \"Desperate Cry\", \"Murder\", and \"Subtraction\" feature brilliant guitar solos to go with Slayer and Master Of Puppets-style riffing, with fast double-bass drumming accompanying it. \"Altered State\" and \"Under Siege (Regnum Irae)\" feature a very dark sound, especially with the guitar playing. \"Meaningless Movements\" and \"Infected Voice\" are excellent pit fare, with even more fast riffing and drumming. Also included on the digipak is Sepultura's cover of Motorhead's \"Orgasmatron\", where Max Cavalera and company do Lemmy's band proud, especially with the vocals. And man, the groove on that song! The digipak also features \"Intro\", which was used at the beginning of all of Sepultura's concerts back in the day, \"C.I.U. (Criminals in Uniform)\", and a remixed version of \"Desperate Cry\".\n\nThis is the first album you should consider starting your Sepultura collection. A brutal masterpiece!\n",
        "\nChaos A.D. is totally different from the previous Sepultura releases. This isn't thrash like BTR/Arise or Schizophrenia, this album has more variety and has hardcore/groove/tribal influences.\n\nThe opening track Refuse/Resist shows what this album is about. tribal drumming and a very catchy riffs. Max vocals on this album are really amazing, his vocals are really agressive and powerfull. The next song is \"Territory\" which also starts with the tribal drumming, for a lot of Sepultura fans this is one of the best Sepultura songs. Slave new world and Amen are decent songs but nothing really interesting.\nKaiowas is an instrumental (tribal) song.\n\nPropaganda is one my favourite Sepultura songs ever, this song also starts with an drum intro and then there is the catchy riff again. This song is so powerfull, (especially live) the drumming of Igor Cavalera keeps amazing me every time I listen to this song.\n\nBiotech is godzilla is a real hardcore track, but still very enjoyable. Nomad is simply amazing, this song isn't fast but so brutal. Max vocals on this track are almost scary, so powerfull! This track shows that Sepultura really changed, no fast brutal thrash but still really agressive/heavy music. Another example of the change of Sepultura is Manifest, this track starts fast and thrashy and by the end of the track you are listening to some brutal hardcore breakdowns.\n\nThe rest of the songs are just decent, but not really interesting just like Amen and Slave new world.\n\nOverall I still really love this album! Songs like Territory and Nomad make this release one of the best things Sepultura has ever done. \n\nI really recommend this release to any metalhead who can appreciate more then one genre.\nStand out tracks : Refuse/Resist, Territory, Propaganda and NOMAD!\n",
        "\nHere we have a classic example of a band at its most brilliant, if not necessarily as technically proficient as it would eventually become. Sepultura showed astounding promise with this release, and would go on to make some equally killer albums before sinking into oblivion. \"Morbid Visions\" is a bare-bones death metal record that sticks to the core ideals of the genre, not straying too far in any one direction, and not collapsing on itself due to lack of innovation. \n\nI admit that by the time the last track rolls around, things sound a bit dull and contrived, but that is easily forgivable. Almost every song is a winner, and the raw production only serves to purvey the aggression and determination of the band. Max's singing is suited well to the minimalist style of the record, and the lyrics, although silly at times, do the job. Igor doesn't bust any balls, but the drumming does set a nice pace. As for guitar, Jairo provides ungodly shrieks and squeals on lead, and Max shows signs of the potential that would be realized on \"Schizophrenia \" and \"Beneath the Remains\".\n\nOverall, a definite must-own for anyone interested in early Death Metal, and the beginnings of a band that would equally mesmerize and disappoint as time went on.\n",
        "\nMost fans of Sepultura lost faith in the band after the departure of Max Cavalera. Under a Pale Grey Sky is the last recording (recording back in 1996, released in 2002) where sepultura truely shines. The album showcases a nice blend between the bands older, more death/thrash metal style songs and their more tribal, heavy metal tracks. The album has a steady and consistant sound, until the later half of disc one where they play 'Troops of Doom' and 'Beneath the Remains/Mass Hypnosis'. While these songs may be classic songs and deserve to be played live, these songs are placed at the wrong time. They are placed right smack in the middle of more new-school Sepultura songs. The rest of the album strays away from older (post Beneath the Remains) material and devlves into the bands 'tribal' phase, which IMO isn't all that bad. The most impressive tracks from this album are 'Attitude' and 'Arise/Dead Embryonic Cells'. These tracks probably display the be and most constant sounds of the album. These are also the more likable tracks from the album. Any fan of Sepultura will enjoy this album for this is the last of good Sepultura... (IMO the only new release worth reviewing).\n",
        "\nMy first full taste of metal music, and a big risk it was too, a risk that payed off big time. Everything was exciting about this album, and even from the first inital glance at the incredible cover art, I knew this was for me. Once in the player, this little disc surprised me even more, it was like nothing I'd ever heard before. Simply the heaviest, intimidating, but crisp, firm and tight guitars melded with memerisingly pounding and fast drums and powerful bass. The total cross of thrash and death metal, which is both styles and doesn't sound quite like either is the best description of this album in every department: vocals, guitars, bass, drums, lyrics, songwriting etc.. The short, mood enhancing intro to the title track gives way to one hell of an opener, speeding through your brain and when it's over about 3 minutes later, you have no idea what just hit you. \"Dead Embryonic Cells\" is less quickly over, the focused, intricate but concise songwriting that dominates the album is taking over here, with occasional grinding groove laden riffs, also a part of keeping me hooked to this album the entire way through (if only the first time). \"Desperate Cry\" is my favourite Sepultura song to date, creative and almost progressive, it's the longest and most interesting song here. Changing riffs, long passages and a mixture of fast and erratic and slow and melodic solos, it epitomises the whole album in one song. \"Murder\" is another blast of short, compact and satisfying songwriting. \"Subtraction\" and \"Altered State\" follow the formula of the tracks 2 and 3 again to the same effect, though they still remain two of the album's more overlooked tracks. The vocal effect in \"Under Siege\" is excellent in conveying the sense of the lyrics, which on this album, made me look at lyrics more carefully and objectively. Carrying powerful political and social messages in concise lines that would appear simple if not for the range of language and understanding they bring across. \"Meaningless Movements\" another showcase in the same style of writing, though no filler with all too similar riffs to what we've heard before thrown in, the strength of the album wouldn't allow it. \"Infected Voice\" is the short, punchy closer along the same lines as the other 3 minute tracks, nice and neat in it's delivery. \n\nNow we get the bonus tracks, and they are a cool set of goodies. The only way I can describe the Motorhead cover is \"cool\"! \"Intro\" the same, especially cool to be heard on the DVD, opening the concert before the band slam into the title track of this album! \"C.I.U.\" is similar to the other songs on this album, though not as memorable, and the Scott Burns mix of \"Desperate Cry\" is just great to hear just for a slightly different perspective of the song.\n\nThis still remains my favourite effort from the Seps, and not just because it secured metal as a new part of my life. \"Beneath The Remains\" may be widely considered to be their classic, and this may not be the same fantastic riff fest, but for what it is, it impresses me much more every time I listen to it, almost two years on.\n",
        "\n(I'm reviewing only Bestial Devastation here)\n\nThis 4 song EP has a lot in common with Morbid Visions (see my review of it), but this sounds more primitive, simple and straightforward. My favorite songs would have to be \"Necromancer\", a sludgy number in the Celtic Frost vein, and \"Antichrist\", a total thrasher that starts fast and goes into a midpaced annihilative thrash break. Later (sucky) Sepultura redid it and played on '94 with the name \"Anticop\". As expected, it sucked, surprise, surprise.\n\nThis EP was in a status of obscurity until Roadrunner decided to release it along with the Morbid Visions full lenght. Now, the latest remastered version of said reissue contains two extra tracks: the aforementioned \"Anticop\" (sucks) and a demo version of \"Necromancer\" from '85 or so that, if I'm not mistaken, is the first ever Sepultura recording, and sounds not too much apart from the final version, but is worth for historical importance, I guess. \n\nA damn good EP, overall.\n",
        "\nSo, this is where Sepultura started (actually, it was the Bestial Devastation EP, but that would be another review). Before they got into the thrash assault of later albums, the teenagers Max, Igor, Paulo and Jairo wrote fast and evil sounding compositions that took all the good stuff that was in Hell Awaits (i.e. all of it) and made it more insane and uncontrolled. Despite the quality on future releases, they could never match this except for Beneath the Remains which is different in style but still very fucking good.\n\nThe main thing that differs from all the later Sep albums is the evil as fuck vibe that makes you feel that you're wandering alone in a cemetery on a misty night with church bells tolling on the background. Some may say that the production here sucks, but again their mothers could have been on coke while pregnant which ocasionated their offspring to start talking at the age of 12 and later become Skylark fans. So that you know, the production values here are PERFECT (think Seven Churches with Darkthrone tweaking the knobs) and keep the rawness and the atmosphere of the songs the way it should be. \n\nAll the songs here range from good to fucking excellent, but my personal choices would be the title track, \"War\", \"Crucifixion\" (I never thought that the latin spoken part on the middle had very much sense, but that's a minor complain) and \"Funeral Rites\", which is similar to the more known \"Troops of Doom\" only way much better. Sepultura later re-recorded \"Troops\" and made it thrashier and more technical but lacking the evil feel and the vibe that is the single most important thing about this album.\n\nIf you consider something worthy of being titled \"metalhead\", or like anything that has to do with the word \"rule\", then get this NOW!\n",
        "\nThis is a totally underrated collection due to it coming out in the \"numetal\" era of the bands career but don't let the connection to Roots fool you. This CD is packed with megaloads of pure metal and bizarre live tracks and covers! Only a few of the NuSep show up (being better ones at that) showing the band at their violent prime.\n\nThe strong parts you ask? The brutal Celtic Front (Procreation of the Wicked) and Black Sabbath (Symptom of the Universe) covers. The blistering hardcore of the Dead Kennedy's (Drug Me) and covers by Bob Marley and Ratos De Parao! The originals that kill are the live \"Biotech is Godzilla\" and the armed \"Beneath the Remains/Escape to the Void\". Even new stuff like \"Refuse/Resist\" and \"Kaiowas\" sounds fucking heavy.\n\nThis is a must own for the Sep fan and I endorse it heartily.\n",
        "\nTo begin with, this is a pretty good album, but it pales in comparison to \"Beneath The Remains\". It is not the utter crap that Chaos AD was, but the majority of the songs tend to fall under the \"didn't I just listen to this track?\" category.\n\nThe first three songs, all fucking masterpieces. \"Arise\" is pure mayhem. Great guitar riffs, fast as hell drumming, if you can't headbang to this song you've now lost your mind, your balls, and your musical tastes, in that order. If you don't believe me about the second one, I'll be coming along in a red jumpsuit and a pair of gigantic scissors any moment now.\n\n\"Dead Embryonic Cells\" is another winner. At this point you'd think this album was going to be better than \"Beneath The Remains\". Some of the best riffs Sepultura has ever written come into being through this thrashterpiece.\n\n\"Desperate Cry\" is no exception either. Haunting accoustic introduction... some good riffs... and the accoustic intro comes into play later on in the middle section of the song as well. Without a doubt, these first three tracks are the best songs on the CD.\n\n\"Murder\" is alright, but it sounds like it's already been done on \"Beneath the Remains\". And then after that pretty much all the songs fall into the monotonous category. None of them are overly spectacular or truly worth mentioning. Good riff-work, but if you want their best listen to the first three songs over again, followed by several thousand repeated listens to \"Beneath The Remains\".\n\nAll in all, good album. It's good to listen to, despite there being only 3 standout tracks, but this album looks like they are running out of ideas. It seems like they used all their energy on \"Beneath\" and then after a quick breather decided to patch up another album with all the leftovers from \"Beneath\".\n\nBut this is definitely an album to get. And although they might have been running out of ideas on this one, this is, compared to their followup - Chaos AD - total genius.\n",
        "\nWelcome to SEPULTURA 101. This is THE quintessential thrash metal album of the 1980\u2019s. By 1989, the thrash metal movement was at the peak of its power. And Sepultura were right on top of the whole scene, four young, hungry guys from Brazil for whom being the undisputed kings of metal in their own country wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 they were out to conquer the whole world! \n\nThe band consisted of Max Cavalera on rhythm guitar and vocals, Andreas Kisser on lead guitar, Paulo Jr. on bass, and Igor Cavalera on drums. What amazes me the most while listening to brutal yet technically perfect riffs on this album, is that the oldest member of the band, Andreas, was only 21 at the time it was released! \n\nAnyway, onto the album\u2026 In a nutshell, it\u2019s perfect. The gentle yet haunting intro to the title track soon gives way to vicious thrash riffing by the guitar duo of Max and Andreas, and those two don\u2019t stop until the very end!!! The songs are cruel, fast \u2013 but at the same time they don\u2019t show that primordial ugliness that was loved by some and hated by others on their previous efforts (\u201cBestial Devastation\u201d in \u201885, \u201cMorbid Visions\u201d in \u201986 and \u201cSchizophrenia\u201d in \u201987). To some extent, this can be contributed to the fact that this was the band\u2019s first album with Roadrunner and they were able to get a producer that knew what he was doing \u2013 Scott Burns. Some even go as far as saying that this was their \u201csellout\u201d album, as Sepultura abandoned death metal \u2013 a genre they helped discover \u2013 and dived head-first into thrash. But the reader is free to make his/her own judgment \u2013 I\u2019ll just say that Sepultura were never about staying in one place. When they felt they exhausted their artistic creativity in one genre, they went into uncharted territories. \n\nBut let the music speak for itself \u2013 and trust me, it can! If you\u2019re not head-banging violently by the middle of the first song, there is a strong possibility you\u2019re wearing a neck-brace. One of the most appealing things about Sepultura for me was the feeling of \u201ccompleteness\u201d I got from their songs. Unlike many other thrash bands at the time, they never abandoned a riff after three seconds to move onto the next riff, just to dump it for the next one. They let the listener fully enjoy the juiciness of the riff in all its glory, never losing any of the power and speed. Many a time, just as you\u2019d think the song has nowhere to go anymore and your neck is about to break if he keeps it up, the band changes tempo completely and Andreas bursts into a beautiful yet crushing solo, or builds momentum until the next sonic attack.\n\nThe lyrics are nothing to write home about, though \u2013 which can be forgiven, since the band didn\u2019t really know English that well, and so wrote some pretty standard clich\u00e9 apocalyptic anthems. It would change pretty soon, though, as Sepultura would later delve into the world of social injustices and inner struggle. In that sense, \u201cInner Self\u201d is a sign of things to come. \n\nHighlights: Well, all of them! But if I was forced to choose, I\u2019d say \u201cInner Self\u201d \u2013 which is my 2nd favorite Sepultura track ever, and \u201cMass Hypnosis\u201d, thanks to the godly guitar solo from Andreas.\n\nLows: NONE!!!\n\nFinal verdict: If you like thrash, this album should already be in your collection. If you\u2019re curious, THIS is the place to start. If you don\u2019t care about thrash at all, you should still buy it, because it\u2019s that damn good!\n",
        "\nToo many times I have heard the same stereotypical response from all sorts of metalheads: \u201cRoots sucked, Sepultura was never good after their thrash days!\u201d I must say I couldn\u2019t disagree more. To me, this album is Sepultura\u2019s finest hour, an album where they finally discovered a unique, amazing sound that many tried to copy, but failed.\n\nBut let\u2019s start from the beginning. Sepultura have come a long way since their \u201cprimordial evil\u201d sound on their debut, \u201cBestial Devastation\u201d (1985). They abandoned death metal for thrash, thrash for groove-metal on \u201cChaos AD\u201d (1993), and finally, their search for a unique sound has come to an end on this album. Make no mistake about it \u2013 this is still HEAVY METAL, but a very different style of it indeed. The most unique thing about this album, for those that don\u2019t know, is that Max&Co incorporated a lot of Brazilian folk influences and mixed them well with metal to create a fresh and unmatched mixture.\n\nThe guitars are down tuned quite a bit. Majority of headbangers don\u2019t like that, but for me, it adds to the overall atmosphere pretty nicely. For the most part, songs are slow, crushingly brutal, and with a lot of \u201cgroove\u201d. The album opens with \u201cRoots Bloody Roots\u201d, slow and maddening number that gets your blood boiling and gets you into the right mood for the album. My advice is to forget all critique you\u2019ve heard about it and try to enjoy it regardless of what others say. The next track, \u201cAttitude\u201d, starts off with a strange sound on some Brazilian instrument, whose name escapes me at the time, it slowly turns into a crushing anthem of youth, giving a middle finger to the authority and establishment. But don\u2019t think that sluggish and devastating numbers are the only thing Sepultura offers on this album. There are straight-up metal and punk (yes, punk) songs, fast and uncontrollable, there is an amazing classical piece, performed by Andreas Kisser on the acoustic guitar; there are tribal jams and chants, recorded while band-members were living at the Amazon jungle with Indians\u2026. Doesn\u2019t sound like your typical metal album, does it? \n\nThe lyrics are a separate matter entirely. Gone are the primitive \u201chell and brimstone\u201d lyrics of the past, written when the band members didn\u2019t even speak English. The lyrics strike a nostalgic chord in me every time I read them. For you see, this was the first extreme metal album I\u2019ve ever listened to back in 1996, and for a teenager who just moved to another country and had a lot of issues to deal with it, this lyrics meant a whole lot to me. Sure, now some people dismiss, not even bothering to read them, as \u201canother mallcore whining\u201d, forgetting that this album was way before TV and Radio got saturated with the likes of Slipknot and Linkin Park. \u201cCriticize me, call me negative, but you never deal with life or reality, I separate myself from the rest, what the fuck do you expect?!?!\u201d\u2026 \u201cLive your life not the way they taught you , do what you feel. Survive the jungle, Give me blood, Give me Pain, These scars won't heal\u201d \u2026 And, of course \u201cSepultura in our hearts, Can't take it away, These Roots will always remain\u2026\u201d It\u2019s ironic how a year after singing this, Max Cavalera has left Sepultura, and in another year he was fronting a mallcore band, while the rest of Sepultura without him quickly descended into hardcore mediocrity\u2026.\n\nHighlights: Title track, \u201cAttitude\u201d, \u201cStraighthate\u201d, \u201cJasco\u201d, \u201cBorn Stubborn\u201d\nLows: \u201cLookaway\u201d and \u201cItsari\u201d\nFinal Verdict: On \u201cRoots\u201d, Sepultura explode with influences from every possible and impossible source. If you actually give this album a chance without prejudice, you\u2019re in for a great listen. As for me, no matter what music I will listen to at the moment, this album will always hold a warm place in my heart for introducing me to Sepultura, and to heavy metal in general (before it my knowledge of it was limited to Metallica and Scorpions).\n",
        "\nI love every Sepultura productions before \"Roots\", with that one the band has lost the direction they had given to the whole thrash metal genre, on the contrary, with \"Roots\", they have begun to be more ethnic and make more \"open mind\" music!\nThe main menu contains three submenus:\nIn the first we have the best live show they could give us, I' m referring to \"Under Siege\", live in Barcelona, a real piece af the \"Arise\" tour, supporting the best (for me) Sepultura album ever!!!\nTotally impressive performance, with the most beautiful songs of the band, drawn from the first to the last work!!\nThe second is \"Third World Chaos\", that contains all the videos of the band, from \"Innerself\" (Beneath the Remains), to \"Slave New World\" (Chaos A.D.), and some live videos where the band has played some covers and \"Kaiowas\" with all the members beating the drums.\nThe third part is \"We Are What We Are\", the last VHS, containing the three videos drawn from \"Roots\".... obviously this \"little\" mole prevents me from giving a full 100/100 rating, I don' t like the album very much and hate particularly \"Ratamahatta\", that didn' t merit the carrying out of a video.... however, this is all the material with the \"classic\" line-up, and it would be a real crime to not have it completely!!!!!\nThe DVD is sown with various interviews (that you can skip, because each interview is a trace).\nBuy this masterpiece, cost what it may!\n",
        "\nLong before Max Cavalera because a bushman/whigger hybrid, got an adidas endorsement, or grew pink dreadlocks, Sepultura played intense, chromatic thrash in the vein of early Slayer or possibly Possessed. Indeed, one may wonder how Sepultura's presence was barely felt up until the early 90s. One word: location. Before the modern era of telecommunication, and with no means of distributing their records, Sepultura were stuck playing for lizards and primates in the Brazilian jungle. \n\nAfter your token \"scary noises from hell\" intro, From the Past Comes the Storm opens off with some simple, yet effective thrash riffage played at hyper speed. The midpaced, grinding style that would later develop on albums like Arise rears it's head every once and a while, but Schitzophrenia more or less relies on gritty riff after riff. Max Cavelara's voice is surprisingly guttural, and may require some adjustment for anyone who is used to his trademark shout. \n\nTo the Wall, Septic Schizo, and Troops of Doom (a holdover from their even more savage debut), are the standout tracks, as well as the two instrumentals: inquisition symphony, a 100 mph roller coaster ride that totally destroys the archetype of how much ass an instrumental can kick, and The Abyss, a masterful minute or so acoustic piece. In 87, few bands were playing this extreme (Death, Possessed, maybe Onslaught...), and in 84 (when Morbid Visions was released) even fewer. Also, one must take into consideration their age (17 or 18). \n\nSo the final verdict is: breakneck jungle thrash, and Sepultura's first memorable release.\n",
        "\nSo Sepultura wakes up one day, realising that they've competely shat on their thrash careers by releasing the abortion known as \"Chaos AD\" so they figure, what the fuck, they haven't go t much to lose... \"let's try to cram as many really fucking retarded ideas into one album as is humanly possible!\"\n\nRemember kids, they ran out of riffs halfway through the Beneath the Remains tour, and just barely had enough left over for Arise, so don't expect to suddenly find any on this album. What there is, however, is a whole fucking lot of shitty, shitty mallcore. And groove - oh yes, when you're missing riffs, you gotta go for the groove. Songs like \"Attitude\" and \"Born Stubborn\" are the best examples of silly modern rock with dumbassed guitar work, played slowly-to-midpace with no conviction. Even Chaos AD sounded better than this, it's that bad.\n\nOh there's the tribal angle too... yes, they really fucking play this one up - because something's gotta come in now that all the riffs have gone. There's one song here (\"Itsari\") that's all tribal chanting, and I don't think the band even is featured on this track!! The silly shit props up in a bunch of other songs, including \"Roots Bloody Roots\" and more... I mean, in and of itself, \"Itsari\" is okay for what it is, but when you try to combine that sort of thing with guitars, it just ... doesn't ... work ... AT ALL!! It's like having yourself a nice refreshing slice of pizza, and washing it down with some tasty, delicious anti-freeze!!!\n\nThen you've got the really amazing lyrics. I mean, Sepultura never really had great lyrics, but at least they were never this overtly prominent in the mix where you were forced to listen to their sheer monstrosity. \"When you go down! When you go down motherfucker!\" Oh yes, I'm really feeling the intelligence now.\n\nOh yeah and there's the guest vocals and shit. \"Look Away\" has two of our favourite characters, none other than Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst. Such a shame that the Air Force wasn't conducting maneuvers in the area and \"accidentally\" dropped a thousand-pound munition on that room when this was taking place.\n\nMy God, this album is so fucking atrocious. It's the equivalent of shitting on the ceiling. Sure, it's different, and takes some effort, but in the end, it's just shit all the same.\n",
        "\nThis is the second pure thrash LP that Sepultura released (after the death metal Bestial Devastation EP and the riff monster Morbid Visions). And good God, did they manage to do a good job of it or what? The only reason this album does not get a higher rating than Beneath the Remains is due to the production - the riffs are as good, if not better than those of Beneath the Remains, especially on the first song, \"From the Past Comes the Storm\". That song is a perfect example of massively riff-oriented thrash: 41 riffs of 9 distinct categories, and 7 major tempo changes, if I counted correctly (I did, once!) \n\nThe rest of the album is no slouch either. \"Septic Schizo\" and the instrumental \"Inquisition Symphony\" stand out, as does the completely redone \"Troops of Doom\". Schizophrenia is an essential thrash album - the production is a bit weak (maybe the remaster sounds better, I have the original), but the riffs are completely godly.\n\nAt times, the tracks sound exactly the same (I swear there's a riff in Resti n Pain that is a rehash of a riff in Escape to the Void, but don't ask me to look it up right now), but ya know what, when you're crushing the cunts of those that signed up for such a treatment (by listening to In Flames, for example), it's perfectly okay to stab them twice in the exact same vital organ.\n\nRecommended. Endorsed. Go and get it, or it will reborns you!!\n"
