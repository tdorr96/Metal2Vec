        "\nOf all the renowned thrash metal cohorts that started marching in the 80\u2019s, Exodus have been the one to continuously slip under my radar. A major reason for that is that said radar hasn\u2019t been programmed to detect every little movement in their camp through the years. I\u2019m not sure why\u2026 I certainly liked the debut, which I got some time in the late-80\u2019s, but this slab never fired me up to the extent of tracking religiously every subsequent product of the band. So the next four albums, including the one reviewed here, I got at the same time, in 1995 to be precise, which helped me get a pretty good picture of the guys\u2019 state of affairs, the band doing a fairly good job to keep thrash alive and well in the late-80\u2019s, their actual foray into the next decade\u2019s environment \u201cImpact Is Imminent\u201d included. \n\nWith the influx of new music currents in the 90\u2019s, the scenery started to change, and this force of habit here is just another knee-jerk reaction to those changes. Or is it? Provided that it saw the light of day in the summer of 1992, the musicians must have had plenty of time to sit down and premeditate their next step\u2026 their colleagues from Metallica struck gold by courting these new sound bites\u2026 there\u2019s always room for one more dedicated studious team at the top\u2026\n\nonly that there wasn\u2019t. Not for this gang, not for any other one. The band\u2019s impact was felt, sure, but strictly in the slightly above-ground circles. And this is not because they sold themselves cheaply to the groovy vogues with the album here. In fact, this slab seems like a sincere undertaking; after all, we\u2019re talking over one hour filled with music; you\u2019ve got to have put a certain portion of your heart and soul to accomplish this. \n\nAnd they by all means have. And they should receive kudos just for the sheer scope and audacity displayed\u2026 cause this effort spells \u201cambition\u201d. It\u2019s true that a sizeable part of this ambition has been thrown the modern post-thrashy sounds\u2019 way, but still. This side of the albums does sound emulative, but is not really unapologetic, especially on the more energetic material (\u201cMe, Myself and I\u201d) as the real pull-down here are the covers, The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cBitch\u201d and Elvis Costello\u2019s \u201cPump It Up\u201d, both goofy light-hearted interpretations which bring very little to the table, a disputable presence which only adds to the groovy ballast accumulated elsewhere. The band sweep the area for those but not very assiduously although \u201cFuel for the Fire\u201d and \u201cFeeding Time at the Zoo\u201d are major thrashy invigorators which even the previous opus lacked. The band\u2019s penchant for lengthy more elaborate excursions goes over-the-top this time with the gigantic 11-min odyssey \u201cArchitect of Pain\u201d that inevitably serves less convincing numetal traps despite the several rowdy thrashy riff-patterns roaming within. \n\nA charming but convoluted, overdone conglomerate which by all means contains enjoyable moments, but one can\u2019t help but wonder if the ties to the guys\u2019 earlier output have been inserted as an excuse for their already realised, both in theory and practice, metamorphosis. They do sound like legitimate old-schoolers, nothing perfunctory about them; if they\u2019ve been dropped from the \u201cImpact Is Imminent\u201d recording sessions then here\u2019s an explanation for their existence. A lot of music has been covered, groove, post-thrash, covers, thrash, long sprawling epics\u2026 obviously the band wanted this entry to matter, both as a slogan proclaiming their awareness of the new at the time vogues, and as a testimony of their still-standing allegiance to the old school. They by no means managed to fool anyone that the sequel would be \u201cBonded by Blood II\u201d, but at least there were patches of integrity sewn all over it: this was going to be a gradual shedding of skin, a momentary sitting on two chairs, the gap between them not looking that ominous. The band fans must have been sad, though, as everyone performs pretty adequately here, like again the band have already chosen their divisive ground, Souza in particular, the man pouring his emotions in his staple vociferous but effective high-strung manner; like he really wants to win everyone around for the guys\u2019 new cause\u2026\n\nand he could have probably achieved this; if the band didn\u2019t vanish shortly after this album\u2019s release. So they themselves didn\u2019t believe in this new cause then\u2026 or found it too futile to keep marching in groovy unison without the respective lucrative returns. Cause they were only going to do that if their pockets had gotten full of cash, right? Who wants to keep doing something they don\u2019t like just for the sake of it? No such films, and a dissolution was the next natural step, the guys never wasting precious time in analysing the situation, and to find out how on earth this force of habit they put so much effort in, never became the next Black Album. Nope, no such foolish deliberations in the Exodus camp; the band simply upped the tempo after the reformation in the new millennium, bringing back their retro thrash vigour to a large extent, and have been doing pretty well ever since, even during ill-calculated moments like the re-release of their mythical first instalment. Exhibitions, blood, machines, benevolent or otherwise\u2026 there\u2019s seldom a dull moment in this camp. And we\u2019re watching it now\u2026 much more carefully; cause we don\u2019t want to miss another habitual melting-pot, with all the glaring flaws and redeeming merits enthusiastically blended.\n",
        "\nAfter Exodus released their smashing and thrashing debut Bonded by Blood, there was only one way to go further on: release another smashing and thrashing release. This little demo right here was the bridge crossing between 1985's Bonded by Blood and 1987's Pleasures of the Flesh.\n\nThis is certainly not a demo worth noting on, except for the fact that Paul Baloff sings on it. If you aren't a Paul Baloff fanatic to the core, you aren't going to get anything out of this demo that isn't on the final Pleasures of the Flesh LP.\n\nThe only real big change between these tracks and the final versions, other than the obvious inclusion of Paul Baloff, is the lyrics to Seeds of Hate, which no longer discuss the end of the world and is yet another stupid thrash anthem. We get it. You're a thrash band. You vocalized this very well on Bonded by Blood, Exodus, A Lesson in Violence, and Metal Command. This track is fairly unnecessary and the changed lyrics on the final album are a huge improvement. Compare \"hatredddddd, is spreading like the plague\" to \"IIIIIII, feel the power within\". \n\nNow, there's some stuff one can get out of this little demo release. The snare drum on this isn't painfully dull like the final album, so that's a pretty big plus. The guitars sound a little heavier on this mix, but it's kind of ruined by how loud they made Paul Baloff's vocals on here. Also, this sounds surprisingly great for a demo, and if you told me these were recorded for the final album, mixed and all, then rerecorded once Steve joined, I would believe you in a heartbeat. \n\nSo yeah, better sounding drums, mildly better sounding guitars that are ruined by overly loud vocals, a lesser version of Seeds of Hate, what else is there on here that's any form of a benefit, or disadvantage? I guess Brain Dead is almost better than the final album counterpart, except the fact that it's missing the chorus, and I just prefer Steve's vocals overall anyway. The title track has got nothing special going for it here, it just sounds like the final version but with Paul on vocals instead of Steve. Really, you can go either or with this track.\n\nI give this demo a 65% and 6/10 stars. \n\nNoteworthy tracks: Brain Dead\n",
        "\nMetallica's Creeping Death, in my honest opinion, is the greatest thrash song ever written. One of the most noteworthy aspects of that song is the undeniably catchy and iconic die chant section at about the halfway mark. Now, Kirk Hammett had written that absolutely fantastic riff, and another thing to note is that Kirk Hammett's first band was Exodus. Why is this all worth mentioning? Because this track right here has that same exact riff that was later used in Metallica's fantastic 6 minute epic.\n\nThe production on this single isn't the greatest because it's from an old live recording, but you can still tell what's going on (though, I wish someone could figure out the lyrics). I'd say this single also has Paul Baloff's best vocal performance. There's a ton of aspects in this track that are great, but that chorus riff that was later used in Creeping Death just doesn't sit right in this song. It comes out of nowhere, sounds nothing like the rest of the song in tone or anything, and it's played way too fast compared to how epic it sounds on the Metallica variant. I'd say while Kirk Hammett had some fantastic ideas in this, he perfected them once he took some stuff over to Metallica.\n\nNow, Endor, or Ender, or whatever the hell you wanna call it, is kind of disjointed and not really my jam. I can kind of tell why this song didn't make it to any albums because it is just fairly uninspired and tired sounding. I think a better B side to this single would've been a better sounding version of Whipping Queen or Warlord. Oh well.\n\nIn conclusion, this single is a very nice little release and something to showcase Exodus' Kirk Hammett years. I'd say this is an essential listen to Exodus fans, Metallica fans, and just thrash metal addicts as a whole. \n\nI give Die by His Hand a 79%, and 7/10 stars.\n",
        "\nConsidering the long wait that these thrash metal legends have bestowed upon their fans after the energetic, somewhat melodic return-to-the-roots predecessor \"Blood in blood out\", it would be hard to expect that the cult-of-a-personality that is Gary Holt could deliver something mediocre like the atrocity albums again. Despite the overall quality of the material (riffs, lyrics) on the latter, they've been arguably dimmed by the raspy vocal approach of Dukes, which has seemingly stained those records so much, that they had been received sub-lukewarm by most Exodus fans to say the least. The return of the anticipated by many (including the author of this review) Steve \"Zetro\" to the band in 2014 has ignited the hope in the followers of this riot act all around the world, and has arguably added a legion of its new adepts due to Steve's more sound vocal manner.\n\nA false statement would be to say that the review's author does not enjoy the outputs of this band during Dukes's era. However, I have been more than pleased to hear Zetro's return on the band's 2014 record. His approach to barking out the lyrics is much more fitting, and perhaps it even describes the band's unrelenting onslaught that is poured onto the unexpecting listener from album to album due to the mere fact that it (Zetro's voice) has become iconic. The subliminal notion that Steve had found his vocal nieche way back when and has pretty much stayed true to it and hasn't strayed away comforts fans. It is even more surprising to hear his vocal experiments on this record, because right from the first track Steve goes into this almost growl-like manner of shouting the chorus of the song, which I can't call unfitting, rather unexpected. The sporadic experiments continue on throught the record, as Zetro goes from high pitches to almost extremely low, which adds to the diversity of the songs, making their choruses and bridges indeed various and catchy. A feature worthy of noting are the doubled vocal lines on some songs' choruses, like \"The Years of Death and Dying\", where high and low pitches blend together creating the ambiance for the underlying guitar melody - a solution not typically used by Exodus.\n\nIt's now the time for the traditional guitar sound opinions, and my opinion is that the sound on this album hits one in the face hard. Period. It would be unwise to expect something else from Gary, a person obsessed by in his words: \"...crunchy-ass guitars and fast double bass.\". The delivery of the guitar riffs is great, starting with the intro riff of the main theme song and ending with the last banger, \"Antiseed\" - the technicity of the performance is excellent. Something, in my opinion, sounding less convincing are the solos. During almost all of the songs Gary continues to spin the idea of his \"5 licks\" that have made his career (lol). In no way do I criticize Gary for that, considering that this is one of the merits that I personally admire Holt for- honesty-, but I still think he could've tried to leave his comfy box and explore something beyond the quick, 3-note minor pentatonic and harmonic minor licks. Where his harmonic minor skills do shine, though, are during the solo of the song \"Fires of division\". The rest of the lead material is pretty Exodus-generic, if you know what I mean. \n\nThe drums on the other hand are something to behold, considering Tom's age and the torment that he's been going through lately (at the time of the review's writing). This is indeed one of his most technical and probably fastest records that he's ever played on. I can recall Tom saying in one of Dukes's videos, during the recording sessions of the second atrocity exhibition that that (atrocity b) was the fastest record they'd ever done, and that \"... we can't go any faster, unless we start doing blastbeats and shit.\". Well, the closest that their latest opus comes to blastbeats is during the title song's chorus, and at the start of \"Clickbait\", and the album still manages to \"outrun\" the atrocity b speed-wise. \n\nThe sole conclusion that can be maid by the review's author after listening to the record is that it is subjectively outrageous to realize that the band did not gain its place among the \"great\" 4, expanding the latter to 5 or replacing one of its contestants, with both cases equally acceptable. There's really not much else to say about the one-hour long masterpiece that this by all means legendary band has managed to spawn forth. Being a long record that most other Exodus's outputs are, it does not feel like that, with all 12 songs playing their lenghts on listener's single breath, partly due to their variety and melodicism. A must-hear, in my opinion.\n",
        "\nOne of the most praised of the \u2018Big 4\u2019 of thrash, I always felt that along with Metallica and Dark Angel, Exodus were amongst the more overrated ones out there. Sure, it wasn\u2019t the lack of aggression or heaviness, but just the fact that they lacked the sheer fun factor and songwriting skills of titanic bands like Megadeth, Anthrax, Sepultura, Forbidden and the like. The worst of bands like Slayer and Exodus was the fact that the aggression was to a fault, with little to no variation in the music or any attention paid to proper melody and dynamics. Sure, thrash is partially one-dimensional in its very nature, but these guys seemed to take it to the other extreme which seemed to work for a lot of people, but not really for me, to be honest. Anyways, just my opinion. In the past I dug a few songs off \u201cBonded By Blood\u201d and \u201cTempo Of The Damned\u201d, but that\u2019s about it.\n\nHaving said that I really wish that I could just leave it at the above paragraph for a good summary as to how I feel about these guys and their music, because frankly that sums up the entirity of the album. Sure, the cover art is pretty cool and appealing, but apart from that the album really doesn\u2019t have anything much going for it, apart from a few songs. A sizable number of songs have good riffs, but the problem is that they are repeated ad bloody nauseam completely robbing them of the fun value they initially had. Seriously, nothing is more annoying than hearing a few good riffs only for the band to completely suck them dry of all the potential they could have had, due to the endless repetition. \n\nNow what I like to call \u2018the riff repeat syndrome\u2019 is exactly what leads me to the my main gripes about the album \u2013 it\u2019s too damn long! In all honesty, all the 5-6 minute songs could have easily been cut down to 3-4 minutes and it would not have made the slightest bit of difference. If anything, the album would have been a heck of a lot more enjoyable to listen to for a start. The lead and solo playing is just about passable with mostly blues and harmonic minor runs here and there. Majority of the good riffs have already been used in previous Exodus songs and other modern albums by Testament, Kreator and Megadeth. The vocals are pretty cool with a piercing black metal shriek employed well with the standard Thrash snarl and yelling vocals mixed with the occasional gang vocals that work damn well for the most part. They really elevates the aggression level of each song and makes me wish more thrash bands would have vocals like this. \n\nAll in all, Exodus are still one of the better thrash bands in the saturated modern metal scene and the most ironic part is that Kirk\u2019s solo in \u201cSalt the wound\u201d is infinitely better than any of the solos on Death Magnetic or Hardwired. Yup, I said it! I mean, take a hint dude, maybe it\u2019s possible that you always were in the wrong band to start with? Just a thought, that\u2019s all. \u201cWrapped In The Arms Of Rage\u201d has a pretty cool intro followed by some of the most hard-hitting riffs on this album making it quite the underrated song of the album. Heck if half the album had the intensity, melody and songwriting of this song, the album would easily get an 80-85% rating in my book. \u201cBody Harvest\u201d and \u201cCollateral Damage\u201d are chock full of mosh riffs guaranteed to make you start headbanging in no time along with meaty guitar licks.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an album to get drunk to, lift weights, workout and blow off some steam, you could do a heck of a lot worse than this and honestly, I\u2019d take this over 80% of thrash out there. It\u2019s loud, angry, stomping and gets the job done pretty damn well. But ultimately the album is quite devoid of any kind of variety or range and the music suffers because of it simply due to the fact that there\u2019s almost no reason for you to listen to it more that twice at best. Hopefully their new album will be the much-needed change for the better and I for one, will definitely be waiting to give it a spin sooner or later. Not better than the Anthrax or Megadeth albums released of late, but I\u2019d gladly take these guys over the recent releases of Slayer, Kreator and Metallica by a country mile. Great fun, but no real lasting value and overlong songs.\n",
        "\nVintage band Exodus with fresh vocals via Steve \"Zetro\" Souza and guitar by Gary Holt takes me back to the 'Impact Is Imminent' days. Though it's 21st Century work from the band there's still somewhat of an old school vibe. It must be Gary and Steve, that's who stands out the most for me on this killer release. Overall though, it was decidedly so that this is an excellent effort! Interesting sounding riffs taken back to the old days when years seemed to stand still. A little off-shoot from Death lyrics there but that's how I feel with this album. Like they're back and packing a punch still kicking ass like they haven't aged.\n\n\"Slipping Into Madness\" is a good track I can relate to but most of the songs are solid riff writing here is top notch! The aura of the album has a tinge of the old school vibe but definitely 21st century Exodus. Zetro has put forth invigorating vocals that suits the music perfectly. The leads are top notch too, some a little sloppy but not much. Mostly the rhythms kick ass.. That's what resonates with me. The overall sound is in your face Exodus with not much a bit of anything else. I like the sound quality a lot. And some of the acoustic guitar melodies. Mostly this album is pretty heavy from a thrash metal stand point.\n\nThey did a good job with the mixing and getting the guitars up there in priceless justice. So, in effect the production was superb. The instruments were all in astoundingly great submission. These guys have been around for over 30 years and they did great in these turbulent times (Covid-19) maybe touring in 2022 as a part of the Big 4. The Bay Area thrashers need to unite with others featuring Metallica, Death Angel and Megadeth (and other bands such as Anthrax & Testament). So many great bands like Exodus are still around, Slayer cashed in after about 35 years but it was just their time.\n\nI downloaded this one first and liked it so much that I bought the CD. Doesn't mean that you have to do the same, but I collect CD's still. So yeah, it was worth paying money out of my pocket to support the band. There are so many highlights on this album a small review isn't enough to appreciate what they've done with this release. They have shown that they're not going to leave the scene especially during hard times not being able to tour. That hasn't stopped them from making great music hitting those creative juices and putting forth one helluv a good album here. Check it out thrashers, it won't disappoint!\n",
        "\nThrash metal bands should never get too comfortable with their own style. Once they do, the urgency that makes most of the best albums in the style as good as they are goes away and there is a serious risk of churning out riffs on auto-pilot. Ever since their reunion around the turn of the century, Exodus has been walking the tightrope between stylistic expertise and formulaic predictability, occasionally leaning too far the latter way. \u2018Persona Non Grata\u2019 is by no means flawless, but certainly sounds more inspired than a majority of their post-reunion releases, including its predecessor \u2018Blood In, Blood Out\u2019.\n\n\u2018Persona Non Grata\u2019 sounds more or less exactly like one would expect Exodus to sound in the twenty-first century, for better or worse. Nobody has to teach Gary Holt how to write a sharp, vicious modern thrash riff anymore and those are here in spades, some of them even having an eerie, twisted feel I have not heard often since Dark Angel\u2019s heyday. But there are also a couple of more contemporary-sounding mid-tempo tracks that plod along for one or two minutes longer than they should. As a whole, \u2018Persona Non Grata\u2019 has quite a pleasant flow, however, so these are not too overbearing.\n\nWhat the album does better than most Exodus releases is throw some surprising twists at the listener. The opening title track has a mid-tempo middle section with a couple of surprisingly melodic guitar solos that was structured differently than I was expecting and just when the following \u2018R.E.M.F.\u2019 appears to settle for the same groove for too long, a really cool pulsating post-solo section breaks up the song. \u2018The Fires Of Division\u2019 toys with time feels and an awesome guitar harmony near the end of the song, while the dark, epic \u2018Lunatic-Liar-Lord\u2019 is one of the most dynamic Exodus tracks since \u2018Pleasures Of The Flesh\u2019.\n\nDespite bitching about modern Exodus\u2019 slower moments reasonably often, it\u2019s really the mid-tempo stuff that meanders a bit. By contrast, when Exodus goes for the truly slow stuff, the results can be excellent. \u2018Prescribing Horror\u2019 in particular is a monstrously heavy doom track with a genuinely scary vibe in the guitar work. It is somewhat reminiscent of \u2018Forward March\u2019 from the \u2018Tempo Of The Damned\u2019 album, though it\u2019s slower and more atmospheric. \u2018The Years Of Death And Dying\u2019 also works surprisingly well. In the hands of a lesser band, it would be another dull mid-tempo plodder, but the interesting guitar arrangement and Steve \u2018Zetro\u2019 Souza\u2019s surprisingly multi-faceted vocal performance up the ante.\n\nUltimately, the only major flaw of \u2018Persona Non Grata\u2019 is that it really did not need to be an hour long. Personally, I could have done without the anticlimactic closer \u2018Antiseed\u2019 and the in one ear, out the other \u2018Elitist\u2019. I don\u2019t find \u2018The Beatings Will Continue (Until Morale Improves)\u2019 all that interesting either, but it does its duty as a short banger in the middle of the album. All in all, the album has a surprisingly large number of inspired moments and it is sonically much better than \u2018Blood In, Blood Out\u2019 as well. Those expecting another masterpiece after not having had any Exodus releases for seven years will be disappointed, but some tracks are real growers.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Lunatic-Liar-Lord\u2019, \u2018Prescribing Horror\u2019, \u2018The Fires Of Division\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nLong breaks in output can often signal a career that is winding down, but nothing could be further from the truth in the case of Bay Area thrash metal pioneers Exodus if the latest studio installment of their 40 years plus career is any indication. With a little over 7 years having passed since the triumphant return of iconic front man Steve \u201cZetro\u201d Souza and the pummeling return to thrashing form that was 2014\u2019s Blood In, Blood Out it would be rightly assumed that the urge to render the collective spine of the masses into confetti via a pummeling auditory assault would be reaching a fever pitch in the minds of this mad quintet. True to form, the hour long foray of unfettered aggression that is 2021\u2019s Persona Non Grata, this outfit\u2019s eleventh studio LP, is a beast to be reckoned with, though also one that balances out frenzied fits of sonic violence at ramming speed with a methodical sense of structure and needed respites into more measured territory that goes with crafting a masterwork.\n\nKeeping to the frenetic spirit that typified the sub-genre at its early 80s inception, this fold goes about their business with the level of speed and fury normally exhibited by bands half their age, showcasing from where the likes of Warbringer and Havok take their cues. The thunderous battery of kit maestro and co-founder Tom Hunting lays the foundation with the precision of a master architect and the explosive energy of a fusion reactor, while the raunchy and glassy bass work of Jack Gibson augments the highly percussive character of the arrangement and sits high in the mix. Likewise, the twin guitar assault of veteran riff machine Gary Holt and Heathen\u2019s six-string solider Lee Altus amounts to a relentless cacophony of punchy hooks and flashy virtuoso solos that can rival any of the shred fests that adorned the classics of the 80s. And at the center of it all stands Zetro in all of his maddened, snarling glory, delivering the lyrical refrains of malcontent in a timbre resting somewhere between the raving heights of Bobby Ellsworth and the deeper growls of Chuck Billy.\n\nFrom the very onset of this extended kill session, this Bay Area mainstay doesn\u2019t pull any punches, and often throws caution to the wind with maximum payoff. The opener and title song \u201cPersona Non Grata\u201d takes the concept of concise speeder meant to warm up the listener and stretches it into a massive, 7 minute long epic colossus of busy riffing, barely human vocalizations and a chaotic foundation provided by the rhythm section that is comparable to the more intense moments on 2004\u2019s Tempo Of The Damned. This highly ambitious blend of early thrash energy with latter day elaboration is not an anomalous occurrence either, as near equally swift and complex excursions into longer territory such as the closing crusher \u201cAntiseed\u201d and the vertebrae-destroying 8 minute monster \u201cLunatic-Liar-Lord\u201d round out the high points of this album\u2019s latter half. In a sense, one could argue that these more developed and multifaceted offerings represent the same ideal that the style sought after in the early 90s via albums like Rust In Peace and Victims Of Deception, namely a balance of high-impact thrash fodder and a more nuanced and progressive sense of structure.\n\nAll the same, the lion\u2019s share of this album consists of Exodus\u2019 forte going back to the days of Pleasures Of The Flesh, namely shorter bangers offered up at ludicrous tempos. The ultra-chaotic ode to media manipulation of the public \u201cClickbait\u201d stands as one of the more ferocious offerings; showcasing a particularly riveting performance out of Tom Hunting that almost completely upstages the rest of the band. The punk-infused 3-minute ditty with a mouthful of a title \u201cThe Beatings Will Continue (Until Morale Improves)\u201d takes a somewhat tongue-in-cheek yet socially conscious stand on how the riots of 2020 played out, yet manages to throw in plenty of tasty guitar treats despite its more streamlined format. Other standout moments in what is basically a near flawless assembly line of top notch thrash fodder include the more blues-rocking yet still amped up thrill ride \u201cR.E.M.F.\u201d and the almost mid-paced and punchy protest banger \u201cElitist\u201d, both of which carries some echoes of the groovier material of modern Overkill but seasoned with an even sweeter savor of guitar solo goodness.\n\nIn essence, this album amounts to a triumphant return to form wrapped in a gargantuan, ground-shaking production as only Andy Sneap can deliver. Though it initially comes off as a modern thrasher after the mold of Tempo Of The Damned and Blood In, Blood Out, the level of musical ambition here is a cut above everything that has come out bearing the Exodus label since the 1980s. It might be a little bit of a stretch to put this in the exact same league as the seminal debut and game-changer that was Bonded By Blood, but this fits in perfectly with what came into the equation when Zetro initially came in to fill Paul Baloff\u2019s shoes. Though some nostalgia hounds may continue to balk at the slicker and more compressed mixing practices that most of the older guard have adopted, the 2020s are proving to be a renaissance-like period for the greats of the 80s, and alongside the recent output of Testament and Heathen, Exodus have knocked it out of the park here.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\n7 years of anticipation for new album by the first thrash metal band ever. Since 2014 many of fellow bands have released at least 2 albums, so one could think Exodus is far behind the competition. Finally, the silence at Exodus camp has been broken in August, with release of 'The Beatings Will Continue (Until Morale Improves)' promoting 'Persona Non Grata'. The title of the album comes from latin \"personae non gratae\", which means \"person not welcome\", usually used in diplomacy. Even if we would extent the usage of that phrase onto music, this album is by no means \"unwelcome\".\n\nIn behind-the-scenes videos, the band would talk about how for this album they'd sit together in the studio and give each other feedback (we see it happening to both Altus and Souza, parts 4 and 5 respectively), instead of recording the parts on their own. I think that kind of helped to make the songs more focused and vicious. Long gone are the days of 6 and more minute tracks dominating the album, full sections of songs repeated to death without any rhyme or reason. Today is the day Exodus can finally understand 3-5 minutes is mostly what they need to kick ass and not overstay their welcome. Stuff like 'R.E.M.F.', 'Slipping Into Madness', promotional 'The Beatings (...)', 'Clickbait' and 'The Fires of Division' are things that Exodus could literally write for their 'Fabulous Disaster' or 'Tempo of the Damned' albums. Those tracks are vicious, deadly and hungry for blood. Just as every speedy-thrash should be.\n\nBut there's always room for slowing things down, which is why we get stuff like 'Elitist', being kind of reminiscent of 'Metal Command', or 'Prescribing Horror' which might be their darkest and most doom metal song yet, complete with lyrical theme of Thalidomide, a drug prescribed to pregnant women in 50s and 60s that's supposed sedate and relief nausea during the first three months of pregnancy, which ended up in lot of miscarriages, and the babies that survive the birth ended up with terrible deformations and health problems. There's also 'The Years of Death and Dying', where Zetro plays the Grim Reaper coming after big legendary musicians, like Prince, David Bowie, Bon Scott and Freddie Mercury. Too bad he's doing that to the rhymth of fucking Arch Enemy rejected track. Seriously, get Angela Gossow or Alyssa White-Gluz to do singing part and you couldn't tell this is not something off 'Will to Power' or 'Doomsday Machine'.\n\n'Persona Non Grata' also offers 3 longer tracks, 6 minute long 'Antiseed', and two songs trimming over 7 minutes - title track and 'Lunatic-Liar-Lord' following short intro 'Cosa Del Pantano'. 'Antiseed' kinda drags a bit in the intro, but the payoff is more than enough to forgive this slip-up. Which I can't say the same for other two. Seriously, you can easily cut of at least a minute of filler, pointless riffing in those songs and it makes them better! Why pick up speed in the title track at 4:55, if you're going back to slow tempo after 20 second? Come on!\n\nAnd you know what all that means... Yes, tracklist is kinda trash, to be honest. 'Cosa Del Pantano' is better off as an intro to the record, followed up by 'Lunatic-Liar-Lord', of course after you get rid of some filler in it (Hunolt's guest solos not withstanding, on this one song he has a lot more chemistry with Holt than Altus ever had! How is that even possible?). Title track can go to the end, serving as a nice closing to the record. How will you set the rest of tracklist doesn't matter as much, but there's still stuff that would work better with different placement, like 'Prescribing Horror', 'Antiseed' or especially 'Clickbait'. If I were to set the tracklist, I'd probably go with this:\n1. Cosa Del Pantano\n2. Lunatic-Liar-Lord\n3. The Fires of Division\n4. Clickbait\n5. Elitist\n6. Antiseed\n7. The Beatings Will Continue (Until Morale Improves)\n8. R.E.M.F.\n9. Prescribing Horror\n10. Slipping Into Madness\n11. Persona Non Grata\n\nHowever, none of the faults are undermining the fact that this album stands head and shoulders above anything Exodus released in over 17 years. Steve Souza sounds as evil as he had even been, Tom Hunting despite his health problems plays like a goddamn beast (and could give some lessons to CERTAIN SOMEONE from a CERTAIN band - while battling cancer, for God's sake!), and Gary Holt cooks those riffs like Gordon Ramsay. It's far from perfect, but it's enough to satisfy my 7 years of anticipation. Get up off your ass and do the TOXIC WALTZ! Exodus is truly fuckin' back!\n",
        "\nI would say that Persona Non Grata is one of the highly anticipated albums in 2021. I would also assume that this album will lead to a lot of controversies because of its sound, songwriting, running-time, cover and God knows for what other reasons. So, what is coming upon the listener? Is it more mediocre stuff like some people said about the pre-listening songs or is it going to be a killer? Well, I will try to answer these questions now.\n\nThe album consists of 12 songs with a total running time of 1:00:18 which is much shorter than the previous Exhibit\u2026 albums (okay they both had their lengths; I have to say). The production sounds like on the last albums: flawless, powerful and full. The cover\u2026 (just write down your thoughts here).\n\nPersona Non Grata starts with the title track which was already released as video a few weeks ago and that song hits you in the face from the first second. Aggressive riffs in the typical style of Exodus with blasting drums together with Steve Souza striking voice makes you feel that you are the person he is singing about. His vocals are quite varied and sometimes even go a little bit into death metal range (not only on this track). Though I have the impression that the vocals sometimes sound a little bit chopped, it is a very good and brutal track. What is the red line on this album are the groovy, melodic parts and the great guitar solos performed by Gary Holt and Lee Altus (I wished that the latest Heathen would kick ass so much!!!) combined with a lot of anger and hate (I love it when Steve screams \u201cmotherfuuuuuuucker\u201d in 'R.E.M.F.'). But I won't talk about every song in epic length but will go more into the album as a whole now.\n\nWell, not everything on this album is good old Exodus stuff, no; they put additional elements into their tracks they didn't do before. It is not really modern stuff but for example in 'Slipping Into Madness' some slight country melodies snuck into the opening riff and the bridge (and a fully country vibe in the instrumental 'Cosa Del Pantano' which is a cool intro for 'Lunatic Liar Lord'). It takes a little to get used to but it fits quite well into the track. Another element is spreading a gloomy and tensioning atmosphere through creeping, sinister melodies that let you expect that something exciting will happen in the next seconds (just listen to 'Prescribing Horror' or the mid part of the aforementioned 'Lunatic Liar Lord'). What was my thought on some tracks is that they put some Iron Maiden reminiscences into them, at least the lead guitar in 'The Years Of Death And Dying' in the chorus sounds a little like that. Not too much, just like the parents in Hansel and Gretel threw a few breadcrumbs here and there. You need some time to discover it, but maybe you will agree with me. Besides, the solo and the breaks in that track are really awesome. And finally, Zetro tries (I mean tries) to sing ('Elitist') which sounds very interesting and not really bad \u2013 I guess that is one of the biggest surprises on Persona Non Grata.\n\nFor me, the most outstanding tracks are the really groovy catchy tracks we all know from Exodus. I don't like it too much when the band applies the parking brake (metaphorical of course) as for example Death Angel on \u201cRelentless Retribution\u201d did but that is my very own opinion. These tracks are in my ears 'Elitist', 'The Beatings Will Continue' and 'The Fires Of Division' which are pretty old school, pure fucking Exodus tracks that leave you beaten down to the ground but very happy in front of your stereo or wherever you listen to the album.\n\nThere are some tracks that you've already heard somewhere ('Clickbait') and some tracks have their lengths and should have tightened up a bit ('Lunatic Liar Lord', 'The Years Of Death And Dying') but I think all in all Exodus recorded a very good album that will get into my favorite 10 thrash albums of 2021 (fuck, this year is almost over, isn't it?). However, the cover...\n\nRating: 8.5 out of 10 broken parking brakes\n\nOriginally written for metalbite.com\n",
        "\nIn Germany we know the nice word \u201csch\u00f6nh\u00f6ren\u201d. It means to listen to something bad again and again until you think it\u2019s good (although it is, of course, still bad). One can vary this phrase. For example, \u201csch\u00f6nsaufen\u201d is the word for drinking so much alcohol until you think the lady in your arms is Miss World (but in fact you would not even ignore her if you had any alternative). However, the fanboy in me was in fear when it came to the new Exodus album. Prophylactically, I switched into the \u201csch\u00f6nhoren\u201d mode. But lo and behold, this would not have been necessary at all. \u201cPersona Non Grata\u201d is anything but a disappointment. Okay, I don\u2019t think that a Latin title is a good idea for a thrash metal record and the cover is as bad as the one of \u201cBlood in, Blood Out\u201d was. Is there anybody willing to steal P\u00e4r Olofsson\u2019s brushes? Has ed Repka died? Or why didn\u2019t they take another casual band photo, remember \u201cPleasures of the Flesh\u201d and \u201cFabulous Disaster\u201d. But the music, my friends, the music... \n\nThe title track starts with \u201cScar Spangled Banner\u201d riffing and kicks off the album in a furious manner. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the riff does not copy the one of the aforementioned classic. It only spreads the same vibes. Just like brothers, these two tracks show some similarities, but have their own personality. And their father, Gary Holt, did not only give the opener of \u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d a baby brother. He knows the success formula of thrash in general (because he was one of the inventors) and of Exodus sounds in particular (this needs no justification, I hope). And so we see that inter alia \u201cThe Years of Death and Decay\u201d stands in the tradition of groove monsters like \u201cBlacklist\u201d or \u201cShudder to Think\u201d and \u201cThe Beatings Will Continue\u201d is the new \u201cThrash Under Pressure\u201d, while \u201cNanking\u201d sits at the cradle of the atmospheric yet mega heavy \u201cPrescribing Horror\u201d. Speaking of some songs of the Rob D. era: this jerk was not involved in the making of \u201cPersona Non Grata\u201d and that\u2019s a good thing, but Rick Hunolt, once part of the H-team and co-author of perfect tracks like \u201cA Lesson in Violence\u201d and \u201cDeliver Us to Evil\u201d, appears with a solo in \u201cLunatic \u2013 Liar \u2013 Lord\u201d and background vocals. The same applies for former live guitarist Kragen Lum. Only Paul Baloff (R.I.P.) is unfortunately missing. But Zetro makes up for that with his powerful, sometimes somewhat hysterical, sometimes very ominous shrieking.\n\nTwo songs fall by the wayside. \u201cElitist\u201d is a mixture of a dull, late Venom song (verses) with a Skyclad-like melody afterwards. \u201cClickbait\u201d\u2026 well, even Gods fail sometimes (otherwise Jeff Hanneman would be still alive). It\u2019s clearly an Exodus song, but unfortunately one of the least exciting ever with a chorus going nowhere. It doesn\u2019t matter, because the overall picture shows a strong, robust and honest metal opus. Exodus have made their peace with their existence as a thrash metal band. No \u201cForce of Habit\u201d absurdities shimmer through the songs, commercial success is not an end in itself. Instead, we get typical \u201cgood friendly violent fun\u201d from a band that does not run out of ideas during the playtime of 60 minutes and 24 seconds. \u201cLunatic \u2013 Liar \u2013 Lord\u201d scores with massive complexity, the casual yet vigorous \u201cThe Fires of Divison\u201d holds great double bass sequences and the straight \u201cAntiseed\u201d marks the final riff massacre. These songs form a very cool last quarter of the album. And needless to mention that they all benefit from the precise drumming of Tom Hunting. Thank God that he could defeat f**king cancer! This gives the album an ever better aroma.\n\nThe quality of the production always influences the flavour of a release as well, that\u2019s a matter of course. Well, producer: Andy Sneap, company: Nuclear Blast. Do you really need more information? \u201cPersona Non Grata\u201d does definitely suffer from a lack of imperfection, to say it this way. Thus, some people could think the mix borders on sterility, but I like to disagree. There is so much vibrancy in the new material of this still agile quintet that we really cannot speak about a bloodless result. \n\nSo let\u2019s come to the conclusion. \u201cPersona Non Grata\u201d consists of two fillers, a short intermezzo (outside the rating) and nine tracks that reflect the thrash metal DNA of each and every band member. These nine songs lie in very close proximity to perfection and it\u2019s a bit sad that the overall result is lowered by the two less strong tracks. 50 minutes plus would have been enough music as well and a 95 + X rating would have been the consequence. However, the vast majority of the songs hits the shit out of my rotting brain. If I would be forced to define my personal highlight today, it would be \u201cR.E.M.F.\u201d, even though I am not totally happy with the lyrics. Already Turbonegro knew \u201cDon\u2019t Say Motherf**ker, Motherf**ker\u201d. Either way, tomorrow maybe I prefer \u201cSlipping intp Madness\u201d? Or \u201cLunatic \u2013 Liar \u2013 Lord\u201d? \u201cPrescribing Horror\u201d? Time will tell, but one thing is for sure in my humble opinion: this is the best album from the US of A for years! No need for \u201csch\u00f6nh\u00f6ren\u201d! Exoduuus attack!\n",
        "\nI originally was planning to review the legendary Bonded by Blood. After all, it\u2019s one of my all-time favourites! But with already 23 reviews written and an average score of 90%, there isn\u2019t anything I can really add that hasn\u2019t already been said before. So here I am reviewing Fabulous Disaster, an album apparently not so well appreciated (79% average) that I think deserves more.\n\nFabulous Disaster starts with the explosive duo of The Last Act of Defiance and the title song. The former, after its spoken intro (similarly to Deranged on Pleasures...), blasts into a super-fast riff-fest, accompanied by Zetro\u2019s frenzied, pissed Bon Scott-like vocals and Tom Hunting\u2019s relentless drumming. It definitely is one this album\u2019s many highlights. The title number, not unlike to the previous song, is another crazed riff tornado but this time, said riffs are much catchier and have a nicer flow between them. If you\u2019d like a foretaste of what Fabulous Disaster sounds like, the title track is the perfect illustration, catchy riffs, silly but fun lyrics, powerful and creative drumming and great vocals.\n\nSpeaking of vocals, this is, by a long shot, Zetro\u2019s best vocal performance. He outdid himself so much he makes his performance on Pleasures\u2026 sound comparatively much weaker. His unique tone might be gritting to the unwarned listener at first, but once you get accustomed to its uniqueness, you will then realise that Zetro is the perfect voice for this era of Exodus. His vocals fit the razor-sharp riffs perfectly well and most importantly, he gives the sarcasm-filled lyrics a whole new edge. See the excellent \u201cVerbal Razors\u201d to get a showcase of Zetro\u2019s performance.\n\nFabulous Disaster gets a lot of criticism for its \u201cimmature\u201d lyrics. Are you listening to some thrash fucking metal or reading a philosophical essay? As I said earlier, 80% of this album\u2019s lyrical content is full of sarcasm and while, yes, sometimes it gets a tad bit cheesy, I can\u2019t help but smile as I\u2019m reading the lyrics of songs like \u201cCorruption\u201d or \u201cVerbal Razors\u201d (\u201dYou can take this all to Hell, shove it up your ass where the sun ain't shining\u201d, fuck yes!).\n\nNow onto the main meal, the riffs! It amazes me how Fabulous Disaster can be this catchy while still showcasing those razorblade riffs that make thrash metal so good. A lot of variety can be found on Fabulous Disaster, from the speed onslaught of numbers like \u201cThe Last Act of Defiance\u201d or \u201cOpen Season\u201d, to the mid-paced mosh anthem that is \u201cThe Toxic Waltz\u201d, to a more ambitious song: \u201cLike Father, Like Son\u201d; instead of being one-dimensional, Fabulous Disaster covers a wide panel of what can be achieved in thrash with great songwriting abilities.\n\nOne small taint on an otherwise excellent album is the War cover, \u201cLow Rider\u201d. It is not insulting or anything, in fact it is enjoyable but it breaks the flow of the album. The AC/DC cover \u201cOverdose\u201d (a CD bonus track) on the other hand is really well executed: Zetro does complete justice to Bon Scott. He really does sound like Bon Scott\u2019s bastard son and I mean this in the best way possible!\n\nOverall, if you like mean, ripping fast thrash metal, this isn\u2019t the album for you. If however you like more light-hearted thrash metal, with catchy riffs and gang shouts, get this album as soon as you can if you already own Bonded by Blood (otherwise, get this one first!). Fabulous Disaster stands out as one of the most tasteful offerings to come out of 1989, a year where many bands were just trying to out-thrash each other (not for the worse though). \n\nFavourite tracks in order of preference:\n\n\u201cVerbal Razors\u201d (Zetro\u2019s vocals on that one are KILLER, for the lack of a better word)\n\u201cFabulous Disaster\u201d (Not a single riff of that song goes to waste)\n\u201cLike Father, Like Son (Great riffs again and a great song structure)\n\u201cThe Last Act of Defiance\u201d (Fast as fuck, great riffs)\n",
        "\nA bold claim I know, but not one that I have taken lightly. \n\nTypically with thrash metal bands you can see a trajectory where their skills improve and they release their most professional album somewhere around the 4th or 5th offering. This is where the band seems to be the tightest, with the best production, and where the band seems to have spent the most time on their songwriting.\n\nThis is also the trajectory that Exodus had. Although most thrash bands when they reach that zenith they change their sound to be more more palatable and more commercial, Exodus still retain more of their signature thrash sound in 1992 than most of their Bay Area thrash contemporaries.\n\nThis album has a few obvious things going against it, but these things are ultimately not very consequential in evaluating the album's quality. The most obvious is that eyesore you see that they call an album cover that they obviously overspent on. Another warning sign is that the band has changed their logo, which by 1992 we thrashers all recognized as a sign that the band was trying to appeal to mainstream rock audiences.\n\nThis album has 13 songs, but it doesn't need 13 songs. Some of these songs are horrible, and are best not ever listened to. A good thrash album doesn't need more than 45 minutes or so of good material, and the way that I look at it is that Exodus generously donated to us an additional 20 minutes of material that should've been used as B-sides or Japanese bonus tracks. In short, I don't consider extra lousy songs to be a detriment but I do consider a lack of good songs to be a detriment.\n\nThis album has the best guitar work that Exodus ever had. A lot of the great Exodus characteristics are still to be found here, but this time they are played tighter than ever. This band clearly knows how to develop riffs and string them together into songs with a sense of movement.\n\nThis album has the tightest drumming and best drum patterns that they ever had. Tempesta just brings out the best in these songs and is right in the pocket. It's little surprise that he had such an upward trajectory in the rock scene, later playing with Testament, White Zombie, Rob Zombie, Prong, Helmet, and The Cult.\n\nThis album has the best production that they ever had. This is not a maxed-out, Andy Sneap-triggered, album created with ProTools. These organic tones and performances were obviously the result of a lot of rehearsals and not digital trickery. \n\nThis album has the best guitar solos that they ever had, from both players. I don't think this is even disputable. The H-Team was one of the strongest selling points of this band in general, and by this point they were masters of their craft.\n\nThis album features the longest, most epic thrash song ever recorded: \"Architect of Pain\", which should've been the title track of the album. They swore they'd never do a ballad, but there were no rules against epic thrash. It's a shame their later longer songs are not written half as well as this one. It features several movements and variations of some main riffs, as well as an excellent lead break. This is Exodus's \"Stargazer\", a song that I could listen to on repeat and not get sick of.\n\nZetro briefly tries a new lower, cleaner vocal style on \"Good Day to Die\" that works surprisingly well and that he should've tried more often, the way that Chuck Billy can effectively mix different vocal styles.\n\nIt's a shame the band talks this album down to this day. They seem to be content now to fan service their way through heavier but far less interesting music.\n",
        "\nA bunch of fun facts: originally this record was supposed to be the next involving Rob Dukes' performance, until he left in June 2014. It is also the album that introduced me into Exodus. 'Blood In, Blood Out' takes about 62 minutes condensed into 11 songs. Three of them lasts for less than 5 minutes, while half of the songs are over 6 minutes. It's important to note all these things, since most of the time you can make few cuts to the songs here and there, cut out unnecessary stretches of certain sections, cut completely fragments that kills the song momentum and BADA-BING, BADA-BOOM, you have a roughly 50 minute album that is the strongest bands' effort since 'Tempo of the Damned'. I mean, for the love of Paul Baloff, is it too hard for Gary to make a double listen and realize certain sections are just pointlessly dragged out?\n\nI'm sorry, but it's bullcrap like this that prevents me from saying that Exodus is back on track. Such a shame too, because everything seems to be place - Steve Souza is back, so there's no worry that we're getting one-dimensional metalcore-ish vocals again. Everyone is also still here, minus Rick Hunolt. But sadly, this album was apparently written before vocalists' shift, which is... noticable.\n\nLet's start with songwriting. If there's a reason why there's so many breakdowns and slowing down tempo in likes of 'Body Harvest', 'Honor Killings' or finishing 'Food for the Worms', please, let me know. Why does these songs need so many bland riffs for their middle sections and slow, chugging tempos, is beyond me. This shit ain't Cannibal Corpse that can pull off 'Inhumane Harvest'. I mean, Exodus proves that they still can play simple and straight-forward songs without wasting time, like title track, 'Salt the Wound'. And even in the shorter stuff the band feels the need to just drag out sections, as if they \"build up momentum\". Guys, just 'cause you have a Heathen guitarist, doesn't mean you have to play like Heathen. Or that you have the songwriting skills to pull it off. But frankly, neither does Heathen. Fucking ironic, isn't it?\n\nI'm just saying - less is more. Not always, sure, but if we're talking about songs that are 6-minutes long, when they easily could be 4 and a half, then something obviously went wrong. There are definitely bangers here - including first 4 tracks, partially Body Harvest and Honor Killings (when they don't waste you time in their bridge sections), Wrapped in the Arms of Rage - but that's still not enough to say Exodus is back with full-force. They can promote it with all the guests they could hire - ugly solo from Kirk Hammett, unnecessary vocals of Chuck Billy (you and Dee Snider should take a lesson on how to use your guests), or nice, for a change, industrial intro from Dan the Automator that utilizes that goddamn awesome riff. But until Gary remind himself what made Exodus so awesome back in its glory days, we'll be stuck with the likes of Funeral Hymn that has only one riff used for 9 minutes or Nanking, which has fuck-all happening in it and not even cutting it down would make it work. So far, 'Persona Non Grata' seems to hit the right notes. But will it be victorious return for Exodus? Well, we shall find out on November 18th and following weeks.\n\nAlso, that mix. Man, that mix is SO CRISP. Please, Andy Sneap, give me more of this and less of 'Exhibit A' or 'Enemy of God'.\n",
        "\nWe've all heard how bad of an album 'The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A' was - songs kept dragging way too much, the arrangements were not interesting, most of the riffs just lacked any substance beyond being \"fast\" and closer to groove or hardcore than thrash. So after Gary Holt and co. decided to stop humiliating 'Bonded by Blood' in 2008, after 3 years we've got a sequel to an ambitious analysis of society called 'The Human Condition'. How clever. But does it improve over its predecessor?\n\nWell, barely, but it still does. Starting from the fact that the riffing in songs became much better and bit more varied for songs. Thank God, we're over the days of reusing the same riff for a 9 minute song! Well, not quite. Just cause this doesn't happen, it doesn't mean the songs don't drag. Well, first of all, 5 of 12 songs are over 7 minutes, but only 3 songs (one of them being an intro to last song) take less than 5 minutes. That, of course, means lot of repetetive sections, songs taking their sweet fucking time to finally kick off... Look, I don't say long song immediately suck. As long as you can arrange them well, or have good riffs to support it, it's fine. But Exodus didn't learn anything from their previous albums and didn't get the memo that their songwriting methods don't work for longer songs. Seriously, guys, you're not Heathen, you'll never be.\n\nFirst song is meh enough, but 'Beyond the Pale' takes about 7 minutes and I fail to see the reason why. Nothing that this song does justifies its runtime, especially the sudden breakdown after the solo, where any tension dies and then it just picks up the pace again. No speaking parts, no screaming, no nothing. What was the point of that? \"Nanking\" is also 7 minutes, it's much slower, but it still has no reason to last for as long as it does. Also, why does Exodus feel the need to spoil every riff appearing in their songs? Seriously, what the hell is this songwriting? Is Gary Holt just not satisfied with playing thrash metal anymore? It definitely sound like.\n\nThere are few songs which I still can enjoy, or I could love if it wasn't for phoned-in Rob Dukes' performance, whose clearly not a good fit for thrash metal. There's 'Downfall' which is one of the most catchy tunes of this album, has great melodies all around it. 'Hammer and Life' is a much needed slow down time, and it's exactly what Exodus song should be like: short and straight to the fucking point. If 'Democide' would get some cuts here and there, it'd be much more enjoyable, cause its atmosphere is excellent. 'Good Riddance' and its intro is a good way to be this album's sendoff. There's also a bonus track called 'Devil's Teeth' which has a guest appearance by non other than Brendon Small, of Dethklok and Galaktikon fame. This is so awesome on so many levels!\n\nBut yeah, that's as much of positive feedback I can give. It has some notable improvements, more good songs than just one with an intro, and instrumentally, it seems better than Exhibit A. Mainly the drumming is more expressive than previously, and production is not as overbearing as predecessor. But there is just as much of schlock that should've been hacked off, since it brings nothing worth of note anyway. Next up - Zetro's glorious return to Exodus...? We shall see.\n",
        "\nMany know of Exodus for their classic 1985 thrash album Bonded By Blood. Before it was redone (poorly) in the studio with 2008's Let There Be Blood, Exodus reunited in the midst of their 90s hiatus and brought us this offering. This is a recording of an early show from their 1997 reunion tour, which they actually got vocalist Paul Baloff, the guy from Bonded By Blood, to come back for. Gary Holt plays guitar on here, along with Rick Hunolt, and of course drummer Tom Hunting is back. Soon to be longtime bassist Jack Gibson is new, taking Rob McKillop's spot in the lineup. The setlist consists of basically every Bonded By Blood song and 3 early versions of songs from Pleasures of the Flesh. That being said, this album is obscure enough that most Exodus fans will have probably heard the studio versions of these tracks before hearing this album. In some people's eyes, that is cause to question the existence of this album. Why redo tracks from a classic?\n\nWell, even if you've heard those albums before, you haven't heard them like this. Thrash is a genre which generally benefits from being seen live, and this album is no exception. The songs are all great, with some being relentlessly heavy due to the live setting and production. All the songs on here benefit greatly from the chunky modern-style Exodus guitar tone which would appear on their studio albums from Tempo of the Damned onward. I'd say this album's versions of Piranha, Strike of the Beast, Pleasures of the Flesh, as well as the ripping rendition of Kirk Hammett's Impaler are especially enhanced. For a live album, it all sounds really good, it's honestly close to studio quality and would be mistaken as such if not for the occasional crowd yells and Baloff's endearing stage antics.\n\nBaloff puts on a more lively performance than on Bonded By Blood, though his voice is quite different 12 years later. In my opinion, he's generally better here than on Bonded, despite how raspy his voice is. Anyway, he has such great moments, like the part right after Piranha, when he praises the crowd and starts talking about hunting down and murdering posers. A lot of his antics are hilarious and they really add to the feeling that you're there while you're listening, which is something that can't be said for many live albums.\n\nI believe a lot of solos played on here are improvised, which is cool, but sometimes I find myself missing the solos I know and love from Bonded By Blood. Another of the only real complaints I have about this album is that the setlist doesn't contain the full Bonded By Blood tracklist. It's missing Metal Command. However, since that track isn't nearly the best song off their debut, I don't think it's so terrible that they didn't play it.\n\nI can't stress this enough, if you like Exodus, you MUST listen to this. If you don't like Baloff's vocals on Bonded By Blood and wish you didn't have to listen to Let There Be Blood to sate your craving for these riffs, this is for you. If you love thrash and the energy of an 80s thrash show, you'll definitely like this. I personally go so far as to say they finally outdid their debut with this album. Mark this as one of the times that redoing an album worked.\n",
        "\nYou know the thrash metal bands outside of Big Four, right? Overkill, Testament, Vio-Lence, Death Angel, Dark Angel, Morbid Saint, Kreator, Tankard, Exumer etc. - you name it. And then there's Exodus. They started out great in the 80s, with beloved by many 'Bonded by Blood' and my absolute favorite 'Fabulous Disaster' being their peak. Its speed and aggression blend perfectly with melody, Steve \"Zetro\" Souza's iconic vocals and at times humourous lyrics. And while they've never top it, their later releases didn't suck either, even the inconsisent and misguided attempt at cashing-in on Pantera's popularity called 'Force of Habit'. They did manage to come back in a great way with 'Tempo of the Damned', their most aggressive and brutal release to date. However, it only continued to went downhill ever since.\n\nRob Dukes joining the band after Souza's departure actually didn't bother me at first. I was at one point in love with his records, but I still prefer me some 'Zetro'. I just like when vocalists are easily distinguishable among others, which is also why this 'new wave of thrash' from newbies is relatively boring in my eyes. But Dukes was still \"okay\" for me back then. However, time has passed, I stumbled across other bands and after a while I came back to Exodus and... Oh, have my views on it changed...\n\n'The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A' is a part of duology, though we wouldn't see a sequel to it until Gary Holt and Co. stopped making a mockery out of their most recognizable record. But whether you believe that 'Let There Be Blood' is band's best effort to \"rape\" 'Bonded by Blood', it's not really important here. Besides, even if it's bad, then people might come back to the original, and maybe even new fans would, too, so that's a double win for Exodus...? In a way, I guess. But doing injustice to your old songs is one thing, cause originals will still be present. 'The Atrocity Exhibition' however, proves that Exodus have completely no fucking idea what they're doing.\n\nWhile it's starts on a fairly positive note, with melodic intro 'Call to Arms' and followed up by straight-to-the-point 'Riot Act', the album loses basically all of its steam by 'Funeral Hymn'. Don't get me wrong, the main riff is awesome. But the entire song is just built upon this one riff and it's two different variantions. I had a problem when Anthrax made over 6 minute long 'In the End' based on one riff repeated over and over again, and I have the same problem here. This song has nothing to fill its ridiculous runtime of almost 9 MINUTES! 6 should have been enough, especially since 1/3 of it are solos (we'll come back to them in a moment). I used to love that one song, but now I just get bored in the middle of it.\n\nAnd this is what rest of this album comprises of. 6-9 minute songs that are way too long for their own good. Like, is there any good reason why 'Children of the Worthless God' also takes over 8 minutes? As if the 'Funeral Hymn' wasn't enough? The title track of this record is especially painful in that regard. In the 4th minute you'll start praying to God to end this torture, because this solo just drags on and on. But I'll still leave the subject of solos for now. Or you know what? I may just as well discuss it, because there's really nothing else this album has to offer.\n\nWhile the excessive soloing was fun on 'Tempo of the Damned', it's now just annoying. Why does Gary Holt and Lee Altus think every song needs a solo from them both? Funeral Hymn, for example, has a quite long solo from Lee, then from Gary in slower section. But the song picks up the pace and... We get another long solos, but in reverse order. Like, was there any need for this? They could have easily cut 2 out 4 solos in this song and 'Funeral Hymn' would be less exhausting. Of course Dragonforce does that too, but that's part of their charm - they're over the top, they know it (or at least knew) and they're embracing it, their guitar duels are dumb and fun to listen to, whether it's real or not. Meanwhile, Exodus are taking themselves seriously (yeah, the guys behind 'Feeding Time at the Zoo' and 'The Toxic Waltz' are trying to be serious, okay), but due to lack of good melodies to support it, their soloing becomes incredibly boring and doesn't improve the songs in any way. And 'The Atrocity Exhibition' (the song) also has the same problem. Its first solo by Gary starts off great and epic, finally some fucking good melody! But of course, it's way too long and it just keeps dragging on and on. For some goddamn reason. Look guys, not every song needs a solo from you both. You can always indicate who gets a solo on this song, who gets a solo on the other song, and maybe one or two where you both can show off.\n\nThere's also an issue of vocals. Again, I didn't mind Rob Dukes at first, but man, does he really starts to annoy me. He's really not a good fit for Exodus. The music like this, especially this snoozefest, needs a charismatic vocalist to make it... Well, less boring. But Dukes sounds as generic as it can get. You could find a lot of hardcore/groove vocalists that could have replace him and you wouldn't tell the difference. He doesn't have the wild attitude of Paul Baloff or a voice that you can recognize instantly, like Zetro. And there's very little variety to his vocals, all he does is just screaming the lyrics out without any sense of rhythm to them. And even if he tries to spice things up in 'Children of a Worthless God' - i.e. doing 'clean' vocals - it sounds like a bad copycat of Zetro. I actually went on this site to check if Steve isn't credited as a cameo. It's hysterical.\n\nI start to think bringing Altus to Exodus does more harm than good to everyone. Altus has barely any time to play in Heathen, a band where he's actually useful, Holt all of a sudden felt the need to extend almost every song he's writing for... I don't know, just so he can one-up Altus in the end? Or maybe he's trying to impress him and say \"Look, I also can play proggressive thrash metal!\"? If so, then the effect is laughable, because this is what Metallica and Iron Maiden does when trying to do \"prog\" stuff - just stretching the song to absolute maximum without asking themselves if they should. Like seriously, even if Dukes' vocals are annoying, a simple fixes such as cutting few spots and repeated sections in certain songs makes for a MUCH BETTER experience. I barely try to do it, because it's often unfair when a band makes few songs longer and then some asshole swoops in and discredit their effort. But when they're doing it in a such a blatant and lazy way like Exodus - they get what they deserve. If they want me to respect their albums, they should start with respecting their fans' time first.\n\nAnd I almost forgot. Andy, I like your mixing work a lot, but this time you really phoned it in. I know you're often balancing on the verge of Loudness War, but this mastering is shit. Thankfully, you did learned your lessons. For the most part.\n",
        "\nLet me state right at the beginning that I am in no way, shape, or form a Baloff fundamentalist. The man was in the right place at the right time and more power to him. No one could possibly deny the major role he played in building the legend of Exodus. From the aspect of sheer musical firepower, however, picking up Zetro was absolutely the right move. His raspy AC/DC vocals, with a melodic undercurrent never too far from the surface, were the final piece of the puzzle for Exodus to become a serious contender. Not that there was anything wrong with Bonded by Blood, mind you. It\u2019s just that it seems like Exodus, \u2018scuse the pun, seems to be providing something a bit more nutritional here for us to sink our teeth into.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that, for sheer songwriting power, this album is peak Exodus, along with Fabulous Disaster, though I\u2019d give a slight edge to this one. Unlike most albums, it\u2019s a bit backloaded, with the three strongest songs located in the second half. \u201cSeeds of Hate\u201d is a prime example of this, its axiomatic Bay Area riff, used in the intro, unexpectedly giving way to a monster groove over which Zetro lays down some of his most melodic lines on the album. Couple that with the fantastically memorable solos and you have a prime example of how fun and exhilarating the use of melody can be in thrash, without slipping into something like USPM, a problem which often mars Overkill for me. This one is followed by \u201cChemi-Kill\u201d, the band\u2019s mastery of exciting and eventful mid-tempo thrash (a rare thing) on full display on this one. And what to say of the legendary title track? The band truly becomes a fine-tuned machine on this one, with multiple parts and tempo changes of this quite lengthy song handled with immense skill, never letting the intensity drop for a second. It helps that the song features some of the most memorable riffs, guitar harmonies and vocal lines on the whole album. I cannot stress this enough \u2013 the riffs are never a problem with Exodus \u2013 but it\u2019s the quality of the vocal lines that has improved by leaps and bounds here, something that Zetro and the band as a whole are rarely given credit for.\n\nNow, the first half of the album is not quite as strong, but it\u2019s still of very high quality. There\u2019s a bit of a fast song/slow song pattern, and I\u2019d even go as far to say that the opener (after the obligatory, but pretty amusing, if entirely exploitative, spoken word intro) \u201cDeranged\u201d is maybe the weakest song on the album, though it does introduce the band\u2019s more jagged sound quite effectively, with guitars thankfully much drier and sharper than on the debut, though not as dry as on the Disaster. Much like \u201cSeeds of Hate\u201d and \u201cChemi-Kill\u201d later on, \u201cBrain Dead\u201d and especially \u201c\u2019Til Death Do Us Part\u201d provide a convincing argument for measured riffs and catchy melodies, at least by the standards of thrash metal. Of course, the band likes to close each album with a barely coherent scorcher, this time \u201cChoose Your Weapons\u201d getting the honor, with the title really saying it all. However, this time around, even the first half (side) closes with a song that threatens to go off the rails, the even less coherent \u201cFaster Than You\u2019ll Ever Be\u201d. Not that either is bad. Exodus do this type of song exceptionally well, and even more so here, where the relative clarity of the production really increases the punch of this type of hysterical thrash. Still, of the speedfests here, \u201cParasite\u201d takes the top spot, for sheer precision and a chorus (and even a pre-chorus) that is prime Zetro when it comes to melodic sensibility. Furthermore, the song is enriched with some of the best guitar harmonies Exodus has ever come up with.\n\nThere is precisely one problem with Pleasures of the Flesh \u2013 the drumming, though it would probably be fairer to say \u2013 the drum production. Considerably \u201cwetter\u201d than the rest of the instruments, the drums do have a noticeably weird place in the mix and even seem to fall out of tempo on one or two occasions. This takes some getting used to, it must be admitted. However, claiming that this brings the album down in any substantial way would be taking the argument too far.\n\nThis is my go-to Exodus album, even more so than the equally excellent, but slightly overlong, Fabulous Disaster. It displays the simple joys of thrashing unencumbered by NWOBHM hang-ups (they got that out of their system on the debut, as every thrash band was obliged to) or the need to invent new genres (rest assured there is no proto-death/black metal here). Weird how this one slips through the cracks so often, when it sees Exodus playing to all their strengths and barely showing any of their weaknesses.\n",
        "\nFor years, I\u2019ve been trying to wrap my head around the fervor behind this album. Bonded By Blood represents one of heavy metal\u2019s most iconic records, a thrash classic beloved by many, and for the life of me, I cannot fathom why. Is it because thrash metal only had a handful of releases when this album dropped, thereby augmenting its status in heavy metal history by virtue of being one of the first thrash metal releases? Do fans consider the instrumentation on this album superior to many other bands at the time? Were there plenty of critics at the time praising it, inadvertently molding popular opinion in its favor? Granted, the album isn\u2019t without merit, but judging by its highly revered nature amongst metalheads, I genuinely thought this album would match the quality, intensity, and complexity of Judas Priest\u2019s Painkiller or even Megadeth\u2019s Rust In Peace.\n\nTo begin, my biggest grievance with Bonded By Blood lies with its unremarkable nature. That\u2019s right, I said it: This album sounds mundane to me thanks to a few elements. First, the melodies have little range \u2013 the riffing almost never leaves its mid-pitched station, creating a bunch of songs that sound similar even when listening closely. Second, average riff complexity also suffers due to many mid-tempo shifts in speed, and because Exodus doesn\u2019t possess the melodic talent to differentiate the riffs better, the slower sections feel lazy compared to the faster parts. Third, even the faster riffs fail to raise my excitement because they sound lazy, too \u2013 Why does the opening riff to the title track have a short, but noticeable chunk dedicated to playing one note in between the other melodies? Like, that one note stands out so much because the melodies surrounding that note reach a complexity the rest of the riff doesn\u2019t attain, and this problem appears many times on the album. I\u2019m reminded of Metallica\u2019s opener to Kill \u2018Em All, \u201cHit the Lights,\u201d where the riff structure and song composition resemble Exodus\u2019 attempts on Bonded By Blood, except Metallica have more melodic range than Exodus, making for a more fun and interesting song in \u201cHit the Lights.\u201d\n\nAnother issue I have with this album lies with its status as sacred cow. This is probably an unfair criterion with which to judge this album, but I\u2019d be lying if I said my expectations didn\u2019t play a major role in my reception to Bonded By Blood. Going into this album, I had expected thrash metal so technical, melodic, and substantial, I assumed I would renounce The Big Four in favor of Exodus. Instead, I received a bunch of music that all blends together in one humdrum package \u2013 I\u2019ve heard brutal death metal and ambient stuff with more sonic variety than this album. I would chalk this up to a millennial failing to comprehend a past innovation, except just about every other major thrash band in the early 1980\u2019s exhibited a unique quality throughout their debut releases: Metallica\u2019s strength in Kill \u2018Em All lies with interesting songwriting, Megadeth\u2019s Killing Is My Business\u2026 contained technical ferocity, Show No Mercy from Slayer probably exhibited more melody than the rest of their career while still maintaining an aggressive sound, and Overkill\u2019s Feel The Fire assumes a solid form meshing most of these elements together in one cohesive package. Bonded By Blood has little of anything for me. I don\u2019t know if this counts as sacrilege, but I consider Feel The Fire superior to Bonded By Blood by having more melodic range and dynamic songwriting \u2013 at least Overkill doesn\u2019t give me the impression they\u2019re regularly dumbing down their abilities just to play easier riffs.\n\nTired yet of the pretense and cynicism of this review? You are? Sorry, I have some more criticisms, anyway: I\u2019m not a fan of the soft acoustic guitar introducing \u201cNo Love\u201d because it suggests a song with more melody and substance will follow, not to mention how the title doesn\u2019t match the lyrics at all, even from a poetic standpoint. Speaking of lyrics, I understand I wasn\u2019t a poetic master earlier in my life, but none of the lyrics seem inventive for a group of men in their 20\u2019s (\u201cExodus\u201d strikes me as especially sloppy with its lyrics because of its immature atmosphere regarding both content and construction). The final two notes of \u201cMetal Command\u201d do not match the melody that came before those notes, making for a incongruous and bizarre-sounding song finale. This next complaint could be my specific pressing of the CD I have, but \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d cuts off a half-second after the final note, so it sounds as if the engineer sliced off the rest of the song to finish this album for release ASAP. No, seriously, my CD pressing of this album had the same issue as Metallica\u2019s closer to \u2026 And Justice For All, \u201cDyers\u2019 Eve,\u201d where the album ends immediately after the final note, except Exodus\u2019 own closing track ends even sooner, it feels like. I secretly hope my CD pressing is responsible for this issue, because the notion of someone sleeping on their job \u2013 or God forbid, approving this decision \u2013 seems unprofessional and/or woefully misguided to me.\n\nEven the positive aspects of this album come accompanied with more elements that detract from my listening experience. For example, while I commend the technicality on display for most of the album, the music feels insubstantial somehow, as if the completed product doesn\u2019t match the sum of its thrashing parts \u2013 I blame this on the lackluster melodies and compositions when compared to other major metal acts at the time. As a result of the underwhelming instrumentation, Paul Baloff stands out as the most effective member of the band on here thanks to his legendarily excitable performance, but as mentioned before, even I can\u2019t ignore the poetic weakness of the lyrics. The riff arriving nearly 3 minutes into \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d has cemented a place in my long-term memory as the most enjoyable part of the album, but it has little edge typical of thrash metal and its pace means the album\u2019s best part is non-representative of the end product. Finally \u2013 who approved that cover? I don\u2019t mean the red-background cover my pressing came with, I mean the two-baby cover \u2013 I understand the concept, I guess, but I feel like this idea could have been conveyed more artistically, even for a debut record.\n\nEven after all this, I have to give this album some credit for its technicality and production value: The instrumentation on Bonded By Blood comes across clear and showcases some decent talent, especially the guitar solos, percussion, and vocals. It\u2019s just a shame that all the pieces don\u2019t connect into a cohesive whole for me, as the musical elements on this album have been done better by other bands. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the album is far from a disaster, but the best description I can give to Bonded By Blood is okay. This album is okay, if only because I\u2019ve heard this kind of stuff done before and better \u2013 this album may have the benefit of releasing during the prime era for metal domination, but I can\u2019t deny this album turned me off of Exodus. With music becoming more accessible, I may yet check out the rest of their discography someday, but for now, I\u2019m gonna chalk this up as another album I just don\u2019t get. You may like it, as many others did, but I sure didn\u2019t.\n",
        "\nWhere to start with this cornerstone of thrash. First of all, this album has went down in history as one of the most legendary albums in heavy metal history. Now, looking back on it 35 years after its release, it's clear to see why. Honestly, for its time, this record showcased the raw, pure intensity that thrash metal had to offer, and Exodus were the leaders of thrash at this time. While later on in the 80', bands such as Metallica and Slayer would take the throne as the thrash kings, Exodus was certainly top dog in the early-mid 80's. Often renowned as the first and most respected band in the Bay Area, Exodus were a forced to be reckoned with, as was proven in their live shows and studio material alike.\n\nThe production on this album is gritty and raw. The vocals have a ton of reverb and are kind of poorly mixed, but Paul Baloff more than makes up for it with his sheer energy whilst performing. You can certainly tell on tracks such as \"and then there were none\" that he really puts his heart and soul into it. The guitars are very stripped down in terms of tone, they do sound thin, but once again, the performance from Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt more than makes up for it. The bass is also very notable, as it presents itself as the backbone of the album's production, it is especially prominent on tracks like \"Exodus\" and \"No Love\". Rob Mckillop certainly knew how to cause havoc with his chunky basslines that give the songs some oomph. Tom Hunting's drum performance here is also some of his best work; I find it impressive that a band based in such a poor area, with such little potential and primitive materia can learn and make good music with tight precision, but that can be said for the entire 80's thrash scene, the guys were just mental.\n\nThe title track on this album is iconic, an example of the impressive songwriting that Exodus can boast, it is a short, but strong song overall, the solos are great, the main riff is catchy as all hell, and the thunderous drum beat makes you headbang like a mad man. Now, with that being said, this is sustained throughout the whole album, which I think is certainly respectable, as it gave Exodus a definitive sound right from the word \"go\". Most songs follow this formula of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-solo-chorus-outro, but it works damn well, and the chemistry on this record is on-point, all of the guys are playing their hearts out and you can tell that they put effort into these songs.\n\nThe lyrics are fun and contain typical thrash subject matter, but they are very samey, as most of the songs have the same \"kill you, murder you, beat you up, end of the world blah blah blah,\" and it does get on your nerves after a while, which is the only real con with this album. Although to be fair, it really does fit Baloff's style of singing, along with the pure evil riffs of songs like \"Piranha\" and \"Strike of the Beast\" which are iconic riffs of the entire Metal genre, and the perfect recipe for a good old no-karate pit, complete with empty beer bottles and sweat-sodden battle jackets. But, enough with the silly metaphors, the riffs in these songs are honestly great, and yet another reason to give this record a spin.\n\nAnother of the many impressive things about this album is the technicality. For instance, in the chorus of \"And Then There Were None\" have Baloff harmonising vocal notes with Gary Holt's guitar riff. This is the done in the second part of the chorus where the notes are dropped by a few octaves. They even pull this off perfectly live, so that gives the song some seasoning and in my opinion, really ups its musical value. There is also an acoustic intro in \"No Love\" which is a nice contrast to the rest of the song, as it instantly transitions from soft, legato arpeggios into an evil staccato riff, and one of the best riffs on the album at that.I think these little technical and well thought-out parts to the songs really shows the listener that Exodus do care about their songwriting and want to get creative in order to further boost the quality of the songs.\n\nTo conclude, Bonded By Blood has its drawbacks, but that doesn't make it any less of an essential classic. Come on, why are you still reading this review? Buy it already!\n",
        "\nI read some of the other reviews in this site about Let There be Blood, and I just couldn't help but notice how people hate this album and I can't figure why. What I'm about to say right now may shock some of the most conservative readers, but it is the truth: just because something is considered perfect, it doesn't mean it's untouchable, and just because someone \"touched\" the \"perfect album\", it doesn't mean that the \"touch\" will be 100% sure bad. Enough small talk, let's see what Let There be Blood actually is.\n\nThis retake of one of the most influential albuns in thrash metal's history gave the already iconic songs a new clothing, a more modern sound and a way better production, with the more aggressive vocals of Rob Dukes and a higher tempo for the guitars. And I just loved it! I like Bonded By Blood, but one of the things that bothered me the most on that album is the absolute lame production. I know, that type of production was a trend in the 80s, almost every single 80s thrash album had that type of production, but I don't like it very much. Sometimes it work, like in Kill 'em All and Iced Earth's debut, and sometimes it don't. And I think that in Bonded By Blood, it doesn't worked very well. Let There be Blood fix this personal problem that I had with the album, and as a bonus, gave us a much heavier guitar line and a destroyer vocal, how can someone that didn't lived in the 80s like this re-recording?\n\nThe major improvements are, in my opinion, on the two openers of the album, Bonded By Blood the song and Exodus. These songs are SO MUCH HEAVIER in Let There be Blood that make the original songs sound like hard rock. And although in the other songs you can feel the more heavier sound (in comparison with it's 80s counterpart), in these two songs you can feel the difference the most. But something I actually don't like in this album is the bonus track, Hell's Breath. It's unnecessary, it's like they're saying that this song was worthy of being in the 80s album, and I don't think so. The song isn't bad, it just doesn't fit with the rest of the album.\n\nOther thing I like to add is that Rob Dukes' performance on this re-recording is by far his best performance on his passage through Exodus. In his other albuns with the band, he's too aggressive for a thrash metal band. His vocals have a metalcore vibe, and doesn't quite fit with the thrash clothing, but in Let There be Blood, he found the exact spot in between thrash metal and metalcore, and it was awesome! Even though I still like Zetro more, Dukes earned my upvote with Let There be Blood.\n\nOverall, Let There be Blood is a modern approach to a thrash metal all time classic that, in my opinion, lived up to it's \"father\" and in some songs, even surpassed it. The more faster and heavier approach of the album, allied with the better production and the best Dukes' performance on Exodus just made me fell in love with this album and made it earn a much higher spot on my heart than Bonded By Blood originally had. It's not a perfect re-recording, but it is in fact a really good one, and I just don't understand how can someone dislike it.\n",
        "\nI really want to call this my favorite classic Exodus album, but I just can't, sadly. Among my first listenings of Exodus, I was super into this album's sound and style, specifically the first three songs and nothing else. This album has the best instrumental sound out of all their 80's albums in my opinion; the guitars have a thick, slightly groovish, sort of \"electric\" feel type of sound going on, and the snare is kinda clanky while still remaining softish and solid. I really love how everything sounds on this album, that's why I value this over the others; mostly because of the sound of the instruments.\n\nThe best parts (and pretty much the only parts that have worth) are the first three tracks. The title track Impact is Imminent starts off with an energy-filled bouncy riff that gets you moving, with a great skank beat behind it, couldn't be better. A.W.O.L. opens with a swift riff that's similar to a triplet pattern, followed by a backbone of a drum beat to carry it along and give it some personality. The Lunatic Parade is slower and not as great as the first two tracks, but it's still a great song and is one of the tracks that's again, worth your time. It's a downed-tempo song, and even if it lacks riffs that arent exactly as good as the first two tracks, it's still great. The song actually goes somewhere and keeps you entertained until it ends. The Lunatic Parade has some personality, despite the lack of riffs, that's the issue with this album. An awesome instrumental sound taken advantage by lackluster songwriting.\n\nAfter the first three tracks I'm pretty much forcing myself to listen to the rest of the album, it doesn't capture my attention as good as the first three songs did, the songs after track 3 don't go anywhere, the songwriting is bland and has no personality. Compared to the first three songs, the rest of the album ain't anything special at all. It really saddens me that this album has such great potential; but the potential is pushed aside due to bland, uncreative, dead-end songwriting. I've listened to this album in it's entirety before, but I dont even remember it really, today I listened to all of it properly; and I wasn't all that thrilled by anything I hadn't heard before.\n\nWish I could call this my favorite classic Exodus record. In my head it's always been my favorite even though I'm only fond of three songs. I still like this album but don't really give a fuck about anything that isnt Impact is Imminent, A.W.O.L., or The Lunatic Parade. The cover art is cool though, that's a big contributing factor as to why I have an artistic appeal towards this album, but aside from the first three tracks and the cover art, nothing is of much worth here. I prefer the 2000's- modern era Exodus anyways.\n\nI'd definitely wear this on a shirt, I love the cover art, but you'll never see me listening to anything other than the first three songs.\n",
        "\nIf I had to choose one word to describe Mr Pickles Thrashtacular, it would be \u201cunnecessary\u201d, while if you allowed me another, I think I would go with \u201cunfair\u201d. You see, both bands had already released the albums containing these 6 songs (almost 4 years earlier for Exodus), so using them on this split seems like a bad deal for fans and a slightly redundant exercise in promotion for two well-known bands. Anyway, the two parties should have known better if they thought that fans of Municipal Waste and Exodus would cross over: I\u2019d estimate that 90% of metalheads who like one band know the other, and 99.9% of that group have already made up their mind about how great or stupid or past it the two thrash ensembles are.\n\nThe reason that this split is unfair comes down to Municipal Waste getting through their 3 songs approximately 250% quicker than Exodus, meaning that the actual split of time that each band receives is very far from half. However, I\u2019m not really sure who that is unfair for, since it certainly shows Municipal Waste in their best light when they can whizz through tracks with twice the urgency of the other band, particularly the likes of the hooky \u2018Breathe Grease\u2019. I\u2019m not convinced that the 3 cuts from Slime and Punishment totally show the range of that album, although all of them give a good idea of how Municipal Waste operates for standard songs.\n\nExodus actually saw something of a revival of interest from long-term fans with the release of Blood In, Blood Out, largely because the wayward ideas of the previous albums were discarded in favour of no-nonsense riffing that landed somewhere near the handy concrete fists of Shovel Headed Kill Machine. Oh, and a certain \"Zetro\" Souza was back. Choosing some of the stronger songs from that album allows the old stages to hold their own against the (comparative) youngsters, bruising through \u2018Blood In, Blood Out\u2019 in destructive style thanks to Souza\u2019s extremely distinctive vocal style filling out \u2018Battery\u2019-esque verses.\n\nThe difficulty with this kind of release is always that its quality is in complete contrast to its utility, since no one needs to buy it yet everyone who does will have a great time banging their heads silly. If something a bit more sensible had been done with the split title or the artwork, Mr Pickles Thrashtacular may have been worth something to collectors, though for now it\u2019s really just a reminder that both bands exist and that Exodus really need to get a move on and record some new material. Just choose one of the albums to buy instead.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to Exodus post-Bonded By Blood, it isn't controversial to say they were hampered by a lack of consistency. I would *love* to love the band after their genre-defining debut; all the right elements are there for me: maniacal but tune-carrying vocals from Souza, the ability to write a killer riff, and a dark sense of humour. Sadly, I feel it only all came together momentarily on Fabulous Disaster, itself flawed by inconsistencies of song quality. Whilst the follow-up album Impact Is Imminent offered as much regression as it did progression, any momentum built up over the last three albums is side-stepped entirely on Force of Habit.\n\nFor Force of Habit, Exodus take their cover of AC/DC's \"Overdose\" from Fabulous... and run with that style for an hour. If you fancied Exodus as mid-tempo thrash rockers with half-baked hooks and poppy choruses, then you're sniffing in the right dark corner. Their massive \"Toxic Waltz\" sound is retained, but proves inappropriate for the style they've adopted, and the end result is an album of Exodus originals that come off as Exodus covers. The likes of Van Halen, AC/DC and ZZ Top are filtered through the Exodus lens, with thrash metal further taking a back seat to some rancid 90s alternative metal elements. This isn't quite as embarrassing as Risk, which signalled the tragic conclusion of Megadeth's arrogant commercial (d)evolution; a better comparison would be Annihilator's stylistic derailment from Never, Neverland to Set The World On Fire, though it is more pronounced in this case. In short, Force of Habit masterfully follows the trope of a classic 80s thrash metal band having an almost instant and catastrophic identity crisis at the turn of the decade.\n\nThere's only a whiff or two of genuine thrash to be found, and you'll be glad of it. \"Count Your Blessings\" rips off \"Verbal Razors\" and \"Impact Is Imminent\" before launching in to a goofy, tough-guy singalong (a la the worst of Jeff Waters). The pure thrashing \"Feeding Time At The Zoo\" is as daft as it sounds, and in the context of the preceding material, feels like self-parody rather than a return to roots. But why properly honour your origins, when you can create atrocious faux-metal in the form of \"One Foot In The Grave\" and \"Good Day To Die\"? Both sound as though they were composed as wrestling theme songs, and the latter arguably represents the band's lowest ever point musically - with Souza inexplicably adopting a croon somewhere between Gene Simmons and Axl Rose. \n\nBizarrely, Exodus chose to cover The Rolling Stones and Elvis Costello here - uncreatively updating \"Bitch\" and \"Pump It Up\", and now twice removed from their 80s selves: a thrash metal band imitating a hard rock band covering rock and roll and new wave. And yet the album is not wholly irredeemable. Like 90s Kreator and (briefly) Anthrax, sometimes a change in direction can be interesting. The first third of the album isn't particularly distinctive, but the clunky choruses are catchy enough, and the Van Halen homage \"When It Rains It Pours\" perks things up towards the end. Special mention should also be made of Tempesta's drumming, which adds much needed intensity to the often flat songwriting. Drop the half-hearted thrashers and macho-metal, shave 10 minutes of fat from what remains, and you're looking at an album of quirky B-sides. Or, release this mess unedited and then go on hiatus for 12 years.\n\nSpin to Win:\n\"Me, Myself & I\"\n\"Fuel For The Fire\"\n",
        "\nWith the revival of Steve \"Zetro\" Souza back in the band, Exodus is back in the lineup! What a relief with Exodus not lead by them for years, he's finally back to do a vocals onslaught. The music on here isn't the greatest from Exodus, but at least they're still thrash metal. I think (for me), 'Impact Is Imminent' is their best work to date. That's an old release, too! But let's talk about what's going on here. Exodus spewed forth some good riffs and even over an hour of music, they're still kicking ass! Guitarists would be impressed with the riffs and the leads. Not so much about previous releases, the focus now is on current ones.\n\nThe production quality on here is superb. Everything is mixed in and simply crushing! The tempos aren't that fast. Not like say 'Impact Is Imminent' again, but just good enough to serve the musicians well (guitarists). Gary Holt has shown himself on here too, though his older work I think is better, that is, in the lead department. He's still got it, but not as much as during earlier days. The riffs though are vintage thrash metal. Simply awesome. The musicianship on here is pretty high. I think it's one of the best Exodus albums I've hear in years. Much of that is thanks to Steve Souza now back with Exodus. They were not the same without him!\n\nMelody stricken Exodus is at hand, the riffs are a mixture of thick guitar and then meshed with melodies. They're pretty darn sweet. I would suggest Exodus fans this release because they're focused on the songwriting big time. I think that's what's been lacking for such a long time. Going back to their roots and never abandoning their thrash metal genre. I liked all of the songs on here. I think that all of them are worth mentioning. And the fact that it's over and hour of Exodus playing with their hearts. They really do a good job with the melodies here, I cannot stress that enough.\n\nIf you don't have this album, much shame! Download it on Spotify or listen to it on YouTube if you don't have a digital program. You'll be blown away by hearing that Exodus is back and hopefully their new album will be on its way as well. Listen to all of the songs. Without doing that, you're depriving yourself from the enrichment of Exodus's power and might! And if you like the album that much, you can always opt to buy the CD to play on your boom box or CD player on your computer. This band has gone through many changes over the years so I'm glad they're back as a band that I respect once again! Own this!\n",
        "\nSo Exodus was formed in 1979 by then 16 year old Kirk Hammett. The group released a few demos, before being signed to Torrid Records. The and recorded Bonded By Blood in the summer of 1984. Due to a dispute with the record label over the artwork however, the album was held back from release. The album didn't release until April 25th, 1985. Now that the history is out of the way, let's get down to the musical content...\n\nThe thrash classic title track opens the record. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt's violent riffs are fucking insane! The riffs are fast and most of all, it's THRASH! Rob McKillop is a good bass player but he's hard to hear due to the less than perfect production. Tom Hunting is a monster on drums, his performance is right up there along with Gene Hoglan's performance on Darkness Descends and Nick Menza's on Rust In Peace. He is a master drummer! Now the moment you've all waited for, the star of the show PAUL BALOFF!!! Baloff is the best thrash vocalist ever! His unhinged performance is unforgettable. He is constantly barking the lyrics out with sheer force, he is an absolute fucking legend! \n\n\"No Love\" is one of the highlights, the acoustic intro is fantastic. Gary Holt shows just how creative and talented he is. The main riff is one of the best, and Baloff is amazing as usual. Another highlight is \"Piranha\" with it's violent main riff which will make you want to mosh violently and uncontrollably! The solos are downright INSANE!!! This is just the start however...\n\n\"Deliver Us To Evil\" is the album's epic, clocking in at 7 minutes! This song is more mid paced but the riffs here are mindblowing! Baloff's vocal performance on this track is amazing, especially when he barks out these lines...\n\n\"Incubus in the sky, pentagram held high\nHell's filth hounds begin to bark, the bells begin to tone\nVirgin lies in blood, the blood was once her own\nThe redness and the horror of blood, swept across the land I stood!\"\n\nI highly recommend this album to those who may only have heard of only the Big Four. Unfortunately, Exodus never topped this album, after Baloff left and eventually passed in 2002, Exodus wasn't and isn't the same. Zetro doesn't hold a candle to Baloff. This is THE Exodus album, Bonded By Blood is a thrash masterpiece!\n\nR.I.P. Paul Baloff (Apr 25th, 1960 - FOREVER!)\n\nHighlights: \"Bonded By Blood\", \"No Love\", \"Piranha\", and \"Deliver Us To Evil\"\n",
        "\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu is not that uncommon of a feeling when approaching the exploits of many of thrash metal's standard bearers of old. The tale of Exodus takes on an all too familiar set of twists and turns for anyone even mildly familiar with the backstory of Big Four commercial success story Anthrax, part from the obviously close association with Metallica. Here stands the would be first purveyor of Bay Area thrash that failed to get the drop on Hetfield and company, putting out their first album in the mid-80s and then subsequently losing original vocalist Paul Baloff to a career culminating in mostly non-metal output (Neil Turbin anyone?) and then rounding out the 1980s and early 90s with a vocalist that is more readily recognized as the \"classic\" front man (their Zetro to Anthrax's Belladonna), and the subsequently went on a downturn in quality of output until recently reforming with said vocalist. The only real separation in events here is that Exodus was mostly silent in the studio during the 90s, and didn't really go down the groove metal path until the latter 2000s, and to be fair, the Dukes material was nowhere near as horrid as the nu-metal infused garbage that Anthrax would pump out with John Bush at the helm.\n\nIt would be an understatement to suggest that there is a lot of history trailing behind Blood In Blood Out, such that doesn't lend itself to optimism in those hoping for an eventual throwback to the days of Pleasures Of The Flesh, yet ultimately the result is far better than what preceded it. Far from attempting to jump on the bandwagon of reverting back to 80s stylistic and production practices, Exodus has opted to take a page out of the successful playbook of Testament and Overkill and opted to take the highly compressed, modern thrash sound in a far more effective direction. Discounting the raw, nasally and somewhat Blitz Ellsworth oriented vocal display that Zetro brings with him from his commendable work with his sons' project Hatriot, the overall tone and tenor of the music at play here isn't too far removed from the chunky, massive sound that typified the Dukes era. The contrast comes into play in taking this same massive sound and jacking up the tempo to something fairly close to what was heard on Overkill's Ironbound, but with a riff set that is a bit more modern and informed by the pummeling rage of recent Testament and Death Angel fair.\n\nPerhaps the best way to contrast the modern incarnation of Exodus with their seminal 80s one is by depicting the latter as a warning of a coming Dystopian future, whereas the former shouts to the darkened skyline in 2014 that Dystopia is in our very midst. Leading off the pack is a prelude of radio chatter, ambient sounds, guitar noise and a droning beat that explodes into an enraged beast of thrashing goodness at vertebrae-ruining speeds that is \"Black 13\". Immediately following it stands another pair of crushers fast enough to sate any Slayer fan in \"Blood In Blood Out\" and \"Collateral Damage\", chocked full of busy riffs and agitated solos to give the average human being a seizure. Perhaps even more impressive is that on those few occasions where things \"slow down\", it isn't by a heck of a lot, as mid-paced numbers like \"Salt The Wound\" and \"Btk\" (each featuring guest work by other icon of the Bay Area scene) aren't much slower than the mosh pit monsters that dominate 80% of this thing, not to mention have riffs that get even wilder. There just isn't a dull moment to speak of, and special note should be given to \"Wrapped In The Arms Of Rage\" and \"Honor Killings\" for introducing some creepier sounding sonic content that is almost reminiscent of Voivod's transitional progressive thrash work on Killing Technology.\n\nFor the longtime fan of this band who might have been turned off by the Dukes era releases but still open to the modernized sound that Exodus began employing on Tempo Of The Damned, this is what said album would have been had they decided to just put the pedal to the metal rather than trying to balance the popular groove practices of the day with their older style. There isn't really any truth to the notion that modern thrash is automatically inferior to its older and less loud 80s forerunner, the aesthetic of the former can work just as effectively as the latter if things avoid stagnating and riding on what should be a breakdown for the entire song. Granted, there is a sort of mystique and charm to the older sound embodied in albums like Bonded By Blood and Fabulous Disaster that is absent in the current incarnation of Exodus and is better displayed by some of the retro-imitators that began popping up about ten years ago, but any fan of thrash metal, new or old, should be able to hear a winner here.\n",
        "\nReleased 6 months before Spreading The Disease, 5 months before Hell Awaits and 2 months before Killing Is My Business, Exodus put out a ransom note to the metal world, \u201cGet in our way, and we\u2019re going to TAKE YOUR LIFE!\u201d Yea folks, there\u2019s a reason metal remembers the coming out of thrash and not the efforts of Bon Jovi, Dokken and Twisted Sister in 1985. These poser assassinations kept the masses in fucking line. Unfortunately that more or less changed in the years afterwords as like most second tier bands, they just couldn\u2019t come up with two masterpieces in a row.\n\nIt is solely because of Paul Balloff that I came to respect so-called \"harsh\" vocals in metal. Balloff\u2019s vocals aren\u2019t guttural, screechy, or even barky (certainly not in the modern Hatebreed style of today), but they are destruction manifested in a single agent. But despite Balloff being a larger than life giant in metal, both musically and otherwise, no one is bigger than the group. Part of what most modern metal bands fail to understand (both proper singer and otherwise) is that the vocals are not the center stage of the band. It should be a friendly competitive tension between vocals and distinctive heavy riffs. It doesn\u2019t matter if your vocalist is a guttural extremer roaring his pain or a master soprano displaying skill hitting a difficult note, if you\u2019re just strumming on a ho-hum chord in the background, your band sucks. And that\u2019s where metal\u2019s most underrated guitar duo, the H-team comes in. Yes folks, Hunolt and Holt, not Hammett and Hetfield, are the H-team. Anyone who says otherwise is to be stabbed in front of their loved ones.\n\nThis album is beginning to end thrash. Like a slightly more angry, more violent Kill Em All. I'd imagine this was how most of the supposed \"purists\" Lars Ulrich always whines about (Anybody else starting to think he's making that up and the actual reaction to Fade To Black was more indifference) wanted Ride The Lightning to be. Well, maybe except with Fight Fire With Fire tacked on. What's strange is, as fast and thrashy and violent as this album is, nothing on this album quite reaches that speed. When I hear \"if only this album had come out in 84 like it was supposed to Ride The Lightning wouldn't have gotten all the credit,\" I don't quite believe it because that song in particular is what makes speed-thrash speed-thrash. \n\nThe only moment on Bonded By Blood that's out of place is the little acoustic intro ( not even this album could escape it) at the beginning of No Love. Granted if you listen to MP3's like I do it's nothing iTunes can't edit out but seriously, why was that even there? It's one thing if you can make those little moments organic and grow into a natural song like Merciless Death, Good Mourning/Black Friday and even Fade To Black. But its like why even have stuff like that just for nothing? They can't even use the \"start the vinyl side off smoothly\" argument considering side B of this album starts out with the pounding drums of Piranha. \n\nRegardless, if it's a flaw, it's a minuscule \"gun to your head- pick out a problem\" complaint than anything serious. A one point penalty at the most. Bonded By Blood is the most essential post big four thrash album to own. I would actually place this much higher than a hefty amount of that prestigious group's catalog. Crank up the stereo and batten down the hatches. On second thought, fuck the hatches. Hatches are for wimps and posers.\n\nRecommended Songs:\nStrike of The Beast\nPiranha\nDeliver Us To Evil\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026if you like metal, the heaviest it gets, I wanna hear you fuckin\u2019 scream\u2026\u201d \u2013 Baloff \n\nA Saturday Night Fever theater poster slowly and steadily burns away, possibly set aflame by excessive Jack Daniels fumes seeping from Paul Baloff\u2019s harsh, anti-operatic throatsear while he questions and incites an audience that\u2019s, um, extremely unusual for this joint. Travolta and his now extremely off-white/burnt umber suit smolders to reveal a still shot of Kerry King and that titanic goddamn armband of his. With each of the Exodus frontman\u2019s screams appears a band name in imperial purple that to the world at large has nothing to do with royalty. Royalty, however, is exactly what these bands become, at least in the blackened eyes of the underground metal realm. \n\nManhattan\u2019s Studio 54 - its owners, managers, bartenders, servers, bouncers, dishwashers, coat checkers and regulars \u2013 had to wonder during the show\u2019s throes and no doubt in its aftermath about the thought processes which allowed this horde of heavy metal fans through the doors to terrorize their renowned \u201870s discoth\u00e8que-turned-\u201980s celebrity nightclub. They also realized, quite painfully, this wasn\u2019t ordinary heavy metal as it was widely known, and naturally neither was this mob. This wasn\u2019t Kiss in \u201982, nor was it a thri-way celebration of Ratt invading your privacy, the midnite dynamite of Kix, or how Whitesnake effortlessly slid it in. Not only did the acts of this fateful Wednesday night offer no identities to those outside underground metal\u2019s pentagram-pierced circle, the style(s) of metal championed by band and fan alike was the moon to all but a handful of the world\u2019s inhabitants. \n\nApparently, a disco glitter ball still hung from the ceiling. \n\n\u201c\u2026you guys are fucking awesome\u2026\u201d - Baloff\n\nSomewhere between Eighth Avenue and Broadway on West 54th Street, for probably the first time ever a crowd - largely denim n\u2019 leather-clad elder teenagers to, at most, mid-twenties leather n\u2019 denim-clad adults - congregates on this lovely spring evening as if to attend an ecological symposium, only they\u2019re bent on its destruction rather than preservation. During these still fairly formative years of heavy metal, as well as the even younger toddler days of lesser known, yet more aggressive thrash metal, with t-shirts and patches swearing fealty to Raven, Venom, Slayer, Voivod, and W.A.S.P., this small throng of rogue misfits yelling, hollering and headbangin\u2019 street-side is the epitome of the unapologetic, true-blue, original underground metal masses that knew no bandwagon for any of this crazy shit, and at this date every bent note played during the show was indeed crazy shit. \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is on this April night - with the exception of the purposely-zoomed-in-on homeless black guy in the green skullcap who I can only imagine stumbled into this 99% white mess that's going ballistic about something he has zero interest in, but since it's possibly the most exciting thing that's happened to him since the other day when he found that half-full can of lima beans on the side of the road, he decides to make the best of the situation and, well, 'when in Rome', I guess - every single person out there showed up not only to see their band up there playing, but just as much wanted their band to witness them out there raging for them. Fracture this crowd into a gathering of solitary fans and their becomes his/her band, a single relationship that with favoritism often develops into a private bond. For many underground metal fans like these, many of whom were loners directly because of this unorthodox music and the so few people drawn to it, the scene itself evolved into a home for all such bonds, like a haven for best kept secrets, and because these aren\u2019t public bonds that one shares openly and to just anyone, they become lonesome, and it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the scene to act as building blocks for comradery between strangers who together are both surprised and intrigued to see another person flashing a Manowar or Voivod pin, or are caught marveling at one another\u2019s captivatingly-obscure Tank and Virgin Steele shirts. That\u2019s not to say no one got socked in the eye that night, but I digress. \n\n\u201c\u2026they say the pen is mightier than the sword. I say fuck the pen, \u2018cos you can die by the sword\u2026\u201d - Araya\n\nThe video\u2019s set list, in its unchronological wisdom, is put to exceptional use, initially exposing its knowingly-limited audience to the bands one song at a time and naturally begins with opening act Exodus and with a yarn that introduces \u201cPiranha\u201d which has gradually found comedic infamy over the years, and ends with a cool psychedelically-traumatized solo by Gary Holt, who stands facing his amps in an ending still-shot with picking arm triumphantly raised, then fades into an eruption of Slayer and \u201cDie by the Sword\u201d, which abruptly and awesomely disgorges into existence moments before Slayer's German-helmeted Slatanic Wehrmacht motto marches across the screen. Venom\u2019s sets are a story unto itself, and part of that romantic tale uncovers why the original footage of their leg of this show has never been unearthed. \n\n\u201c\u2026can we say fuck?\u201d \u2013 Cronos\n\nTwo of the three, Venom and Slayer, honor us with interviews, with the former\u2019s nearly eight minute conversation wisely split in two sections. Despite its length and for simple reasons, it\u2019s the more coherent one. With known quiet guy Mantas absent, in the presence of talkative, animated, friendly, funny and good-natured Cronos and Abaddon, the chat rolls by briskly while they fight over a whisky bottle. Fact is Venom didn\u2019t take themselves very seriously despite their anti-Christian reputation and props that went with it. Neither apparently did members of Slayer, who clown around just as much except with four voices instead of two (with Lombardo doing most of the talking when he's not catching flying lunch meat in his mouth) and some endearingly ham-handed editing that cuts it all out of proportion. Regardless, the \u2018views are spread out quite evenly over the video\u2019s course and shouldn\u2019t feel the wrath of the fast-forward button. \n\n\u201c\u2026New York, you\u2019re makin\u2019 California look like shit\u2026\u201d \u2013 Baloff\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the venue itself is small or just the performing area, but as with most space-hindered places the majority of fat bass identity constricts in favor of the mid-range and its treble, but that doesn\u2019t mean the sound is bad. On the contrary, these higher-ranged sonics seem to infuse the music with some slightly greater urgency and possibly even crisps it up a bit. As a whole, I\u2019ve never been dissatisfied with it. \n\n\u201c\u2026alright, this next song, it\u2019s another fast one, but aren\u2019t they all?\u201d - Holt\n\nNow for what's beyond lunch meat. Exodus is first up with \u201cMetal Command\u201d, \u201cExodus\u201d and \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d. The five-piece\u2019s ferocity seems to grow with each song; for any band that\u2019s a vital gift, but for this act it\u2019s only as long as the heavily-reverbed Baloff can keep up, and when his mike isn\u2019t failing, the big lug often lags behind. The other guys know they\u2019re killing it, verified by the twin H\u2019s during a moment of victorious affection* (just as Baloff falters again), meanwhile powerhouse Tom Hunting pounds his ass off during one of their greatest songs, \"Strike of the Beast\". While Bonded by Blood wasn\u2019t even on shelves yet, by the end of their set there\u2019s little doubt unknown Exodus had won over lotsa future metal-clad consumers on the opposite coast. \n\n\u201c\u2026let me hear ya say this one, ahh\u2026\u201d - Araya \n\nEvery thrash band bends a knee to Slayer, as do their fans, the legions of them. While \u201884\u2019s Live Undead is their first official live recording, this is their first official video recording that in my personal history doubles as the initial jaw-dropping time I saw them in action, which was quite awhile before Reign in Blood soaked the planet. Saying the experience merely laid me out is like dismissing a battleship as just a boat, and all of the live video coverage filmed over the years had to compete with (and lose to) how this fiery foursome ravaged every soul in sight on this particular night. \n\nSlayer perform on the razor\u2019s edge of haywire; it\u2019s as if their innate violence overflow valve ruptured and began spewing some new strain of hostility directly into their bloodstream right before the show. Araya\u2019s lungs are diabolic in their disdainful lyrical discharge and are unnervingly forceful while sending several maniacal \u201cAntichrist\u201d screams heavenward. One can actually hear a miniature sonic boom caused by an exploding sound barrier during \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d following the chorus\u2019 refrain and breakdown**. With less than a month\u2019s time in stores, Hell Awaits, their second full-lengther, could only reap the rewards from this show. Slo-moes, purple-ized freeze frames, wavering fire lenses, a skank\u2019s left tit, Tom\u2019s midnight-black mop, a lyric screw-up in \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, Lombardo\u2019s pounding drumwork backdropped by a sweat rag D.R.I. shirt\u2026all these years later I still can\u2019t escape the original chills their set gave me. \n\n\u201c\u2026where the hell am I?\u201d - Cronos\n\nIt\u2019s with the emergence of Venom\u2019s headliner set where things get infamously dubious. Instantly obvious is the bigger stage\u2026the much bigger stage, to fit the dozens of stacked amps no one else had, and extravagance, with way more floodlights flooding this, yes, extravagantly much bigger stage with more psychedelic colors than my imagination had already clothed Holt\u2019s guitar solo in. The sound is polished and voluminous, like a concert hall recording. Well that\u2019s \u2018cos Venom\u2019s portion of the show is replaced with admittedly bewitching concert footage of dramatically tolled-in \u201cWitching Hour\u201d from their \u201982 Live E.P. video, where Mantas body checks amp towers and Cronos tantrums on the floor while the song collapses unto itself around them. It gets better, \u2018cos also clear is that their second and last contribution, \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d, has comparably dissimilar atmosphere, sound and props to \u201cWitching Hour\u201d and the rest of the video. That\u2019s \u2018cos it\u2019s been abducted from \u201884\u2019s The 7th Date of Hell \u2013 Live at the Hammersmith Odeon, another official Venom video, which means the only actual Venom footage from this night captured for this video is the interview. Regardless, story-driven \u201cCountess Bathory\u201d, considered a fan-fave, explodes with pyrotechnical flair before Cronos decimates a ladybug with the moxy to crawl across the stage during their set with his bass. This is after all the type of destructive, chaotic behavior fans of the Newcastle trio know to expect and expect to love. \n\n\u201c\u2026we were in the crowd\u2026no we weren\u2019t, we were on stage, there was people in the crowd. It\u2019s the drugs, Doug\u2026\u201d \u2013 Cronos\n\nIn reality, however, Mantas remained in England sick with chickenpox. Two of his countrymates were drafted in his place, Fist\u2019s Dave Irwin and Avenger\u2019s Les Cheetham, with each learning half of the set list. This factoid means virtually nothing when speaking of this particular show though, \u2018cos while Venom did play that night, their sets weren\u2019t recorded. It seems the agreement to pay the band prior to recording went south, a direction that was soon followed by the video team\u2019s production cables, which mysteriously fell victim to a Venom-wielded fire axe before the headliner took the stage. To make things right, Neat Records compensated the video company with these pre-recorded clips. \n\nAfter the \u201cEvil Has No Boundaries\u201d milieu during the closing credits (fairly prophetic now, for even Studio 54's disco-licking boundary proved ineffective in suppressing Slayer's brand of evil), a gravel-voiced drill sergeant of the Combat army calling himself Major Mayhem promotes some of the label\u2019s available recordings, and even this is kinda sideways cool. \n\nWith adequate camerawork, a coherently chaotic sound and sometimes interestingly distracted, almost free-form style of editing which is perfect for this music\u2019s imperfect primal force, The Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge is, well, simply a great video, even deficit headliner stage footage, and the assorted crowd shots (needed more, especially during band sets) make people either laugh or cry. Sure, it would\u2019ve been nifty to see Venom in the same context as their openers, but what are ya gonna do? \n\nSomehow this video has eluded every bounty hunter dedicated to DVD transference and remains a VHS fossil. Also puzzling is how this hasn\u2019t been reviewed for this site until now. More puzzling is why it\u2019s taken me like twelve years to get to it. \n\n\u201c\u2026we love ya\u2026we\u2019ll be back soon!\u201d \u2013 Baloff \n\u201c\u2026lemme hear ya!\" - Araya\n\u201c\u2026die hard!\u201d \u2013 Cronos \n\nFun fact #ky0i5\u2019: during one of the dates, Tom Araya drunkenly boards Venom\u2019s tour bus and decides Cronos\u2019 hair is a nifty place to take a whiz. Cronos socks him in the eye, sober hands shake the next day, and is the reason the Slayer bassist has a bit of a black eye in the video. From Dave Lombardo\u2019s mouth to my ear. \n\nFun fact F: Venom is one of the few bands to have headlined shows over both Metallica and Slayer (and possibly the other half of the Big 4). A friend of mine has/had this poster when we were in high school. I told him never to get rid of it. Wonder if he listened. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/251146116700159250.\n\n* (30:04 - paragraph eight)\n** (44:22 - paragraph ten)\n",
        "\nI believe I go into most albums hailed as classics or at least as very good with an open mind. I certainly prefer variety, but don't require it, so long as I don't feel like I'm hearing the same song over and over again. However Fabulous Disaster is an instance where variety can horrendously backfire.\n\nThe album starts out well enough. A little too well enough, as even when taking the oncoming problems out of the equation, the title track and The Last Act of Defiance are by far the best songs on here, and certainly two all-time great songs from the band. Whether or not they measure up to the songs on Bonded By Blood/would have been better off with Paul Balloff is completely missing the point, the point is to slam your partner against the wall, kick your friend in the head and have a ball.\n\nAnd....heh, well this certainly is awkward, it is these exact same instructions that are part of what sinks this album to unrecoverable depths of the ocean. Kids, Toxic Waltz blows. That's all there is to it. There's nothing wrong with metal songs about metal or participating in the various \"dances\" of metal, but this? I swear it sounds like Overkill rejected it off of The Years of Decay for being too insipid. \"I used to do the monkey, but now it's not cool\" I could make a two page review on the awfulness of this lyric alone, but I'll keep it simple. The fact that you used to do ANYTHING but no longer do because 'it's not cool' is the dictionary definition of a POSER, the group of people Exodus were known for hunting. Matter of fact, I'm pretty sure this very phrase is used as a sentence example in the definition of poser. Bet whoever wrote that lyric wasn't thinking too far ahead about how one day the so called \"Toxic Waltz\" would be uncool. Now, there's nothing offensive about this song. It doesn't poison metal by advocating any groove, DJs, scooped midrange or rapping. It's a serviceably average thrash song. Therein lies the problem. It would be one thing if this was the first track, or maybe even the last track on the album, but coming off of the chaos that was \"Now you can see what this all means to me when the bomb comes falling down,\" average thrash just isn't going to cut it. The happy go-lucky goofy lyrics are really what ruin the immersion here. If these were the lyrics to Scar Spangled Banner, then maybe we can work with something...scratch that, this third track SHOULD have been Scar Spangled Banner.\n\nNothing that a skip button can't fix, right? Unfortunately, up next is the cover of Low Rider, and THIS is where the album takes a kamikaze nosedive into unsalvageable territory. Look, I like Cheech & Chong as much as the next guy, and Low Rider has its place in musical folklore: the comedy section. But on an album of the second most violent thrash band next to Slayer? Hell, no. Irony and humor has to be handled very carefully in metal. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to step into self-parody, but that's just the nature of the beast. One thing that makes Eternal Nightmare so much goddamn fun is this very execution in concept. However a big reason it works there and not here is because Sean Killian's vocals have this absurd, amorphous quality that allow mean spirited humor to be showcased. Steve Souza on the other hand sounds like Bon Scott's slightly more Marlboro savvy older brother (I don't even like Overdose as an AC/DC song all that much but he pulls off the cover perfectly). Now, Bon Scott can be coy and sly in the way that your cool uncle would show you R-Rated movies and teach you how to get chicks, but even he knew that works as punctuation grammar rather than the whole sentence. Rock & roll, specifically thrash, should be a bar-room brawl.\n\nAs I said, the album never really gets back on track after that. We're greeted by crickets and a swamp, and I couldn't be any less interested. I get that Cajun Hell is supposed to be going for a rapey, Deliverance type of vibe, but after that one-two punch of weirdness what your average thrasher wants is to be bashed over the head with a solid riff. This album might have been able to recover if Open Season or Verbal Razors followed Low Rider, but they don't. I'm sure some rabid Souza fan will tell me how the rest of the songs outside the context of the album are underrated and wonderful, but by the time in the album you actually get to Verbal Razors you just don't care anymore. You just want the thing to end and in this day and age where there are a thousand different ways to entertain one's self, that is the number one musical crime an album of any kind can commit.\n\nIf you must get this, bargain bin it or just download the first two songs from iTunes for your Exodus playlist. This is the most famous outing from Souza, so this didn't leave a good mark for him. Thankfully he would redeem himself about 15 years later.....\n",
        "\nOh hell yes! This one makes Paul Baloff come out of his fucking grave and start killing posers again. From Souza's hellish vocals to the H team's fucking violent thrash riffage, to the brutal drumming of Tom Hunting. This is nice fucking balls out kickass thrash metal, especially considering that this is from fucking 2004. However, it sounds much more modern in production, which somewhat adds to the aggression and brutality. It may have 2004 production, but it definitely sound like 1985 in style.\n\nHowever, there is one weak track, which is the track \"Throwing Down\". It sounds like a groove metal song that wouldn't fit out of place on a Machine Head album. Aside from that disappointment, the rest of the album is totally fucking kickass.\n\nSteve Souza has definitely improved on his vocals. They sound fucking aggressive, seething with hatred and overall fucking brutality, like on songs like \"War is My Shepherd\", the title track, and \"Shroud of Urine\". This album has some of the best riffs since the debut, and they are fucking heavy. Gary Holt and Rock Hunolt play the riffs with pure aggression, and they shred all in their path. Riffs on songs like \"The Scar Spangled Banner\", \"War is My Shepherd\", or \"Forward March\" are so fucking violent that they kick in your face and rape and murder your wife! Yes. It's that good. Also, Tom Hunting's drumming are fucking brutal, easily beats the living fuck out of albums Reign in Blood, where the fast fucking violent drumming of Dave Lombardo reigns supreme.\n\nThe highlight of this album is the SCAR SPANGLED BANNER! The opening riff of the Scar Spangled Banner is so fucking heavy that it could compare with the riffs in the debut. This song kills all in its path with its brutal riffs and violent drumming, along with the crushing solos of Holt and Hunolt, and the kickass political lyrics that Megadeth wishes it could be! \"I'm not a patriot, just a hate-triot!\" Hell yeah! The very next track is... WAAAAAAAAAAR IS MY SHEPHERD! \"War is My Shepherd\" is undeniably kickass, with Zetro's vocals being borderline death metal! The riffs fucking destroy everything, and the solos sound like a serial killer fucking tormenting is victims! Tom Hunting basically shits on every thrash metal drummer during this time, with the sheer brutality in his drumming during this fucking song. The title track is fucking brutal, an utter brutality that could rival fucking Pleasure to Kill by Kreator, who are the kings of all things fucking brutal. The riffs are fucking violent, and the blasting drumming of Tom Hunting is so fucking brutal they throw your arms in a fucking blender and stick it through your mouth and halfway out your asshole. Zetro's throat ripping screaming sound like the screaming of a person after about 1 week of human experimentation!\n\nThere are many other good tracks, including \"Shroud of Urine\" and \"Blacklist\". I think the lyrics of the former are great, considering I'm an atheist, and the fucking crushing riffs and the Freewheel Burning-style solo right in the middle equally kick ass, and the latter sounds like something AC/DC would put on their Highway to Hell album, and then multiplying the intensity and aggression 666 times, which makes the riffs so much more fucking brutal. \"Forward March\" has some kickass riffs, and a part in the song where Souza kind of \"raps\" the lyrics, but still kicks the shit out of any rap nowadays.\n\nAnother good part of the album is they also include Impaler on here. Impaler is one of the best songs of the band's early days, written while Kirk Hammett was still in the band, and then Metallica came along and stole the riffs of the song, in not just the fast part (Trapped Under Ice) but in the slow part (Seek & Destroy), and then they came in to steal Die by His Hand and Hell's Breath. The riffs are fucking violent like they were back in 1985, and the drumming is fucking brutal, with fucking mindless shredding. Steve Souza screams his fucking head off like Paul Baloff would have. The legendary fast part makes you bang your head as if up from the dead, motherfucker!\n\nThis is an album that any metalhead should get, as Tempo of the Damned is the worthy successor of Bonded by Blood, although 19 years apart, and it kicks ass. Buy this or die, this is their real Shovel Headed Kill Machine!\n",
        "\nIf you don't like this album, Paul Baloff is gonna come into your house and kick your face and rape and murder your wife. This is the best album in all of fucking music.\n\nThe best part of this album is Paul fucking Baloff. Paul Baloff had a fucking aggressive voice, and he was such a fun frontman live. Paul Baloff's homicidal shrieks make the album a hell of a lot more aggressive. On every song Paul Baloff fucking shrieks his heart out, like he's ripping apart some poser's corpse! Nobody was ever as energetic as Baloff on Bonded by Blood. Paul Baloff had the most intense fucking voice on this album, shredding anything into smithereens in songs like \"Piranha\" and \"Deliver Us to Evil\". The riffs on this album kick multiple levels of ass, like in \"A Lesson in Violence\" and \"Piranha\". Gary Holt is the master of riffing, even beating out Slayer with their hellish second full length Hell Awaits. Holt and Hunolt's solos are absolutely chaotic, with legendary solo after legendary solo at the end of many songs including \"And Then There Were None\" and \"A Lesson in Violence\". The drumming of Tom fucking Hunting defined brutality up to that point, with Dave Lombardo's drumming on Hell Awaits.\n\nEvery song is a highlight reel of thrash metal. The best tracks on here are the hellish fast ones like \"A Lesson in Violence\", \"Exodus\", and \"Strike of the Beast\". Strike of the Beast is the ultimate mosher with brutal fucking drumming, chaotic solos, and homicidal riffs which kicks 666 levels of ass. The violent middle section disembowels your skin and disintegrates your fucking skull. \"A Lesson in Violence\" is fucking brutal as hell, and annihilates all in its path. It starts with a brutal main riff that makes you wanna fucking beat up the next person you see. The brutal drumming on this song proves that Tom Hunting beats the living shit out of Igor Cavalera. Paul Baloff screams like a fucking maniac in this song and the solos are chaotic. \"Exodus\" is a fucking beast, shooting everything that walks with a fucking machine gun and leaving in a pool of blood. Paul Baloff's shriek at the end is fucking legendary. The riffs are insane, the lyrics are fucking brutal, and the dynamic solos by Holt and Hunolt basically shit on anything before or after this. There's no stopping the Exodus Attack! Other amazing tracks include the mid tempo crusher \"No Love\", which starts with a classical acoustic bit, before going into a kickass riff written by the master Gary Holt, the hellish shrieks by Paul Baloff, and technical drumming. The demonic solos when the tempo speeds up are extreme doses of pure pissed off fucking energy! \"Piranha\" has 3000 crushing riffs that fucking grind everything to the fucking bone, along with the uncontrollable screaming of Paul Baloff, and some chaotic soloing at the end. And of course nobody could ever forget the classic title track, with its legendary riffs and homicidal solos.\n\nMurder in the front row, crowd begins to bang, and there's blood upon the stage, bang your head against the stage, and metal takes its price! Bonded by Blood!\n",
        "\n10 years in the making, we get the next Exodus album that actually feels familiar. After a turbulent few albums with Rob Dukes, Zetro finally rejoined the band and is as unhinged as ever. Not to say Dukes was bad, but Zetro and Baloff are the definitive Exodus vocalists, since Dukes always seemed a little out of place with his metalcore vocals.\n\nThis album is essentially their Tempo of the Damned 2, so I'll be drawing comparisons wherever possible. While Tempo of the Damned had a few slower paced songs, this album is essentially a nonstop thrash attack. I should mention that Zetro is less reliant on his low registry on this album, and mainly sticks to his trademark shrieks. There's an amazing moment in the song BTK where Testament's Chuck Billy growls and Zetro shrieks lyrics at the same time, which is just awesome. Another vocal quirk of this album is the use of what sounds like two mics. It doesn't happen all the time but it's noticeable on Salt the Wound's chorus. It's a subtle but pretty cool production technique that gives depth to the vocals in a non-doubletracking way.\n\nThe guitars are great as always, Gary Holt has never disappointed in this regard. They have that clean, streamlined, modern sound to them. It's essentially the same as on their last few albums, perhaps less trebley. Holt and Altus do their thing very well, almost as well and Holt and Hunolt. Many solos are shared between the two with twin guitar transitions to one player or the other. It's very Bonded By Blood-esque and makes the whole trading of solos deal less jarring, feeling like one long solo rather than two separate ones. One thing to mention is that their guitar tones are essentially the same, so unlike older releases, it's hard to tell who is soloing unless you know their play style. Not really a big deal though because they're both fantastic players.\n\nThe solos and riffs are great on this album. Much in the same vein as Tempo of the Damned, we have a lot of what I'd describe as marching riffs. I like these especially because drummer Tom Hunting's drumming follows it to a T and gives it a fast, urgent feeling. The thrash is on point, and doesn't let up for much of the album, other than a few songs like My Last Nerve.\n\nUnlike some of the Dukes-era albums, this one is under 70 minutes and despite still being over an hour, doesn't really feel its length. I never felt the need to skip a song or turn the whole thing off while listening. It's so consistent that I can't help but last the whole way through. The album also has less loudness problems than Tempo since the industry has shifted towards cutting down on the loudness war. Not to say that it doesn't have any loudness problems, but it's not peaking like Tempo of the Damned does. Coupled with the clean production, Blood in, Blood Out makes for a very listenable experience.\n\nThere are a lot of features on here for a metal album. We have Dan the Automator on Black 13, lending a small bit of industrial hip hop to the track. It's not even bad, I didn't expect it to work as well as it does, but it was ultimately unnecessary. On Salt the Wound, we have Exodus's original guy, Kirk Hammett, (now from Metallica, of course), delivering a surprisingly ripping solo. After his inconsistent-but-passable performance on Death Magnetic, I was convinced he was out of ideas, but this solo really proved he's still got it. It's very reminiscent of And Justice for All, which is one of his best performances album-wise. Then we have Chuck Billy on BTK. He doesn't do a lot in the way of verses, but at the end we get to hear a growling/shrieking duet between the two singers of Legacy (Testament) which is just amazing. It's truly a highlight of the album. Just listen to it and you'll understand.\n\nJack Gibson, as he has for Exodus's entire modern output, holds the bass down very nicely. Definitely a good replacement for Rob McKillop. He doesn't seem to have the bass eq knob up very high, relying on treble and mids, probably to make his parts a little easier to hear over the blasting beats and guitars. He doesn't exactly have a standout moment on this album, but he does deviate from the guitars at times, which is always nice to hear bassists doing.\n\nBonus track Angel of Death is an Angel Witch cover with Tom Hunting on vocals. Yes, the drummer. Many people don't know this but he actually was the very first vocalist for Exodus. It's very good, and if you can track down a place to listen to it, it's worth it if you like NWOBHM.\n\nAll in all, this album proves Exodus still has balls. Despite having a very rocky 00's output, Exodus makes us their bitch yet again with shrieks, shouts, dueling guitars, ringing bass, and brutal drums. It's just so nice to have Zetro back, delivering his signature vocals once more. If you didn't like 2005-2010's material you will definitely appreciate this release, it truly is a Tempo-style comeback; though perhaps Tempo's peaks were a bit higher.\n",
        "\nThrash metal has started to get its shit together again since around 2001, when Thrash of the Titans happened with the reunion of many great thrash bands, including Exodus, Death Angel, and even the early Testament, Legacy. Exodus released Tempo of the Damned in 2004. Heathen has always been good, but it's really starting to show with albums like Brotherhood of the Snake by Testament and the Evil Divide by Death Angel. This is definitively the best example of such.\n\nThe riffs are almost Bonded by Blood-esque, because it deserves to be in the presence of such album. \"Blood In, Blood Out\" is an ode to the old days, which is the best track since the debut, no doubt about it. The riffs rip your arms like a fucking sledgehammer and stick it up your asshole. Other great songs include the opener \"Black 13\", minus the weird rap intro, and \"Body Harvest\", which has amazing riffs and endless solos by Holt and Altus, and the lyrics are classic Exodus, in the vein of the violent thrashing of Bonded by Blood, the tempo changes make it raw as hell, while \"Salt the Wound\" has a ripping solo by Kirk Hammett, and Gary Holt's was very good, too. Kirk Hammett should join Exodus again. He was amazing on this song, and if Metallica isn't letting him write anything on their Hardwired album, then he should very well join Exodus again. The best part of \"Salt the Wound\" is that the riffs are fucking heavy and Steve Souza is screaming his fucking head off.\n\n\"BTK\" has many amazing riffs and solos, and it's a rather slow song. About 3/4 into the song, fucking Chuck Billy comes in and growls like a madman, like Souza fucking shrieking like a demon from Hell. That is definitely one of the highlights of the entire album. The riffs on \"Honor Killings\" are great, with the lyrics about how absolutely evil Muslims are. I think Muslims are the Nazis of today, because of tragic events like 9/11 and ISIS. \"Food for the Worms\" proves that Tom Hunting kicks the shit out of any other drummer out there nowadays, except for maybe Gene Hoglan.\n\nLee Altus does this really well, considering that he's not Rick Hunolt, who was the other guitarist with Gary Holt during Exodus's early days with Bonded by Blood. His solos are absolutely amazing, basically because he's a member of fucking Heathen since the beginning. Gary Holt is the best riff maker. The riffage of this album is almost as good as Bonded by Blood. It's has his best riffs since \"Scar Spangled Banner\" from Tempo of the Damned. Zetro has not ditched his Bon Scott worship from albums like Pleasures of the Flesh and Fabulous Disaster, but he still screams like a madman, this is definitely his best moment since Tempo of the Damned, especially in songs like \"Salt the Wound\".\n\nI recommend this album to all thrash metal fans, to show that Exodus is still going great, like they were in Bonded by Blood. This is definitely one of their best records.\n",
        "\nLet's be honest: if Exodus had been going for subtlety, they wouldn't have called this album Shovel Headed Kill Machine, so nothing else that happens on their seventh full-length should come as much surprise. They also wouldn't have hired Rob Dukes after Steve \"Zetro\" Souza's departure, since he is one of the most straightforward vocalists you could think of, with a slightly hoarse shout and a slight raspy edge to make it more palatable. They also wouldn't have chosen most of the song titles, most of the riffs, the lyrics, and certainly not the bulldozing bass and guitar tones that start hacking and slashing as soon as 'Raze' opens its battered gates.\n\nThat said, maybe Exodus should have realized just how unsubtle this album was going to be and adjusted the songwriting accordingly. There's nothing particularly wrong with any of the songs here, but the blunt force of this kind of muscle-thrash doesn't lend itself to eight and a half minute epics, nor albums that total 53 minutes, and that's only if you avoid the bonus track. If these guys feel like renting a time machine, going back to the point where they entered the recording studio, and then consulting me about the kind of album they should make (if they can have a time machine, why not?), I would strongly recommend they edit 'Altered Boy' and 'Deathamphetamine' down to about five minutes and expel the unspectacular 'Going Going Gone' and '.44 Magnum Opus', though perhaps keep the title of the latter. Down to 36 minutes and eight songs, I don't think the band would need to change much else and then we'd have a winner.\n\nAside from the unfortunate girth of the running time, the girth of everything else (no, that's not what I'm thinking) is happily excellent, meaning that you'll be troubling your neighbours and possibly the local seismologists when playing this at volume. Jack Gibson must have been thinking Christmas had come early when he heard the final mix because his bass guitar is way up in there with Lee Altus and Gary Holt, meaning that we can hear him grumbling away for the whole album, which is lovely in the mid-paced crusher 'Shudder to Think' and he twangs loosely through the introduction to 'Deathamphetamine', even though he isn't playing especially creative lines. Considering the brutal aesthetic that the band went for with guitars (as Felix 1666 amusingly puts it, this album \"prefers to bang the stage against your head\"), there are plenty of riffs, most of which are satisfying yet uncomplicated. When 'Deathamphetamine' gets going, there are some great cooking thrash riffs in there, then there's the bulldozing of 'Shudder to Think' and 'Altered Boy', plus the intense title track. Paul Bostaph gets in on the pounding too, cracking his snare mightily and chucking in some fills on the slower tracks.\n\nAs I've mentioned, the songwriting leaves a little to be desired, whether that be from shorter songs or more interesting progressions from verse to chorus to lead and back again. Sometimes it's annoying because you can tell that the band nearly made the right decision, such as on 'Altered Boy', where you can actually hear the end of the track (at 5:38, right after the chorus finishes) yet Holt and Altus decide that they're having fun and opt to play another couple of riffs just for the hell of it. Those couple of riffs are pretty decent, though I can't see why they didn't put them into the main song to form a more adventurous verse or to spice up the bridge. The songs that keep things concise are more successful at the intended grievous bodily harm, despite lacking that extra something that would sharpen the aggression to a point and thrust straight through the ribcage. Be it speed, surprise, or great leads, there's an element absent from most of the compositions here, while the only ones that stick out more strongly tend to do so from the power of the instruments as much as the musical ideas.\n\nPersonally, I've been a big fan of 'Deathamphetamine' for a long time despite its flaws, 'Now Thy Death Day Come' successfully blusters off the path with an interjection from Gibson's bass and an onslaught of riffs, and that's not mentioning the fact that I've trained my mum to do call and response to the awesome lyrics of 'Raze'. (For those wondering, I start off with \"Let's start a fire, biggest one you've ever seen\" and she answers with \"You bring the matches, I'll bring the gasoline\", though sadly she can't quite handle the next line. Still, there's time, I guess.) The key thing about all those good songs is that in fact they're catchy as well as heavy, so on the list of things I don't like about Shovel Headed Kill Machine, I have the uninspired main riff to 'I Am Abomination' and the lumpen shouted chorus of '.44 Magnum Opus', both of which are uncatchy and kind of stupid. 'Going Going Gone' also has a weird melodic thing going on with the verses that reminds me of The Ramones for whatever reason, thus clashes nastily with the concrete thrash of this album. Anyway, every song has something of quality to offer, just spread more thinly in those three just mentioned.\n\nTo be brief in summary: Shovel Headed Kill Machine is an album that sounds like its title suggests, overwhelming the listener with heavy-duty riffs and rhythms. The musicianship is nothing truly spectacular, some of the songs need cutting, and Rob Dukes is a bit shouty, but you should still enjoy playing this before, after, and during arguments with your spouse, parents, or neighbours. Happy killing.\n",
        "\nThe fourth album by Exodus is a disappointment compared to the previous one, but unlike the one after this it still manages to be thrash, albeit lazily executed. There are good songs to be found, but the merely okay and the bad songs outnumber them.\n\nIt begins with the title track, and already the album's main problem becomes apparent: the awful production. Just one track in, and I want to strangle whoever mixed this thing. What would have been killer riffs are ruined by the way too muddy guitar tone which makes everything blend together. I can't pick out the individual notes in some of the faster riffs like in \"AWOL.\" The solos provide the only moments of clarity in this sonic mess. I can't say much about the bass because for most of the album it's pretty much inaudible, drowned out by the horrible sounding guitars. Listening to this album for too long hurts my ears. \n\nThankfully, the other two members fare much better. Zetro is his usual charming Lemmy on helium impersonator, just how we like him and just as good as his performance on Fabulous Disaster. New drummer John Tempesta has a very similar style to Tom Hunting, so no major changes there either. However, when the faster parts kick in such as \"Thrash Under Pressure\" Tempesta tends to start hitting the same two things over and over again like he's struggling to keep up with the rest of the band. \"Changing of the Guard\" is the one fast track where he manages to really let loose while still maintaing a high speed. He's nowhere near as bad as Bill Andrews on Death's Leprosy, but it's still a minor annoyance. On the more midpaced tracks like \"Lunatic Parade\" he drums just fine, adding in plenty of variation without getting sloppy. As it happens, \"Lunatic Parade\" is one of the best songs on here, nice and short and catchy as hell with some great leads from the H-team.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: some of the songs are just too long. The album as a whole clocks in at 49 minutes total, but it could be made much shorter and much stronger if some of the longer tracks were shortened. \"Within the Walls of Chaos\" is a perfect example. There is no reason a song needs to be almost eight minutes long if it only has about three riffs, even if those riffs are really good. I get bored listening to it because it just seems to drag on and never goes anywhere, becoming repetitive by the halfway point. \"Heads They Win (Tails You Lose)\" suffers from this as well.\n\nThe album would be vastly improved if the filler tracks such as \"Thrash Under Pressure\" and \"Only Death Decides\" were cut out completely and their riffs used to sustain the long tracks instead. Just don't change \"Objection Overruled,\" because it's perfect as it is, definitely the purest, balls to the wall thrash track on here, though even that amazing song is held back from it's true potential once again by the ear torturing production.\n\nSo if the band had trimmed the fat this album would probably be around 32 minutes or so. The two cover songs recorded during the sessions, \"Free For All\" and \"Good Morning,\" could have been added on to bring it back up to a proper full length. Honestly, these cover songs are better than most of the originals, especially the Ted Nugent one, and I wish they had been included instead being sentenced to eternal obscurity as b-sides.\n\nImpact is Imminent has some very good moments, but they get dragged down by the not so good ones, leaving the final product a mixed bag that could have benefitted from more time spent working on it.\n",
        "\nUnbelievable. For years, I always considered Exodus to be a thrash band to be respected, even though they didn't appeal to me at the time. In my teens, growing up listening to the Big 4, I somehow overlooked these guys, totally oblivious to the immense power they hold. I started properly listening to Exodus at the end of 2015, at the age of 21. Within minutes of listening to Piranha, Chemi-Kill and The Toxic Waltz, I was listening to the albums in their entirety, screaming the latter at the top of my voice while driving to the pub for drinks on Christmas Eve.\n\nAs soon I heard the opening riff to The Last Act of Defiance, I wanted to go outside and slam the first bugger I happened across into a wall and mosh with them. Such a powerful riff (beware, that may be repeated) so powerful you physically cannot resist banging your head to this thrash onslaught. The rest of the album continued to leave me hooked, countlessly repeating each song until I reverted back to Pleasures of the Flesh, to satisfy my thrash fix. Steve Souza's vocals are grittier than ever before, with such roars that grab you by the throat each time. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are once again a force to be reckoned with, churning out mind-blowing solo after solo, each laden with fantastic scales and ear-splitting whammy squeals. Tom Hunting is the ultimate powerhouse drummer, each drum hit clear as day, with the glorious shimmer of vintage Paiste cymbals washing over them. Rob McKillop's bass is sadly lower in the mix but can still be heard quite clearly at times, such as after the first chorus in Corruption or the intro to Cajun Hell. Nevertheless, the man was a solid foundation to the band, and did not receive the credit he deserved.\n\nThe songs themselves have evolved since their sophomore effort, still retaining the classic thrash power, i.e. Last Act, Fabulous Disaster and Corruption, yet also making a bold move by covering War's Lowrider, one I consider one of the album's weakest but still catchy enough to listen to. Cajun Hell showcases a gorgeous blend of thrash and Deep Southern American folk stylings, complete with swamp sound effects, bluesy acoustic guitars and a harmonica. A slower/mid-paced approach is noticed on Like Father, Like Son, which also happens to be the longest track on the album. The tempo changes are perfectly timed, almost teasing the listener with faster passages, only to revert back to the slower tempos at the last minute.\n\nOpen Season, while it is a good track, doesn't personally grab me by the balls and possess me to give myself a headbang headache. Just not as catchy but still worth making it a good album closer. Another AC/DC cover of Overdose doesn't really appeal to me either, nor does it to many other users I've seen review this album, while the live versions of the title track, The Toxic Waltz, Corruption and Cajun Hell are phenomenal, so good that I also bought the 1991 live album Good Friendly Violent Fun, only to discover that the songs off there were identical to the ones off this special edition.\n\nAs much as people say Bonded by Blood is the best album Exodus ever made, I disagree. If I was to recommend an Exodus album to a new listener, I would choose this in a heartbeat. This album rightly deserves its place in the best thrash albums of 1989 category, and my personal favourite in their entire 31 year old catalogue. If you haven't listened to it, please, for everyone's sake, go listen to it now, you'll thank me later.\n",
        "\nIt's no secret that Exodus is a legendary band within the thrash metal genre. \"Bonded by Blood\" was the band's debut full-length, released in 1985. Unfortunately, it was supposed to be released in 1984. Due to issues with the band's record label at the time, the release was delayed by almost a year. This album still is highly influential and one of the most important albums to come out of the Bay Area thrash scene but it could have been so much more if it was released when it should have been, and due to this, Exodus was even more overshadowed by some of the bigger names in the game, most notably Metallica. Even so, \"Bonded by Blood\" proves to be just as important as \"Kill 'Em All\", and maybe even \"Ride the Lightning\".\n\nThis album relies mainly on speed, intensity, and aggression to get the point across. The guitar riffs are razor sharp and some of the most aggressive to come out of 1980s thrash. Melody is surely existent, such as with the acoustic intro to \"No Love\" and the melodic yet aggressive riffing in songs such as \"Strike of the Beast\" and \"And Then There Were None\", which is insanely catchy. This album really shines when things are fast and furious. The title track serves as the album's opener and proves to be one of the band's most memorable songs. The main riff is solid and the trade-off soloing from Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt became a staple for Exodus, as well as a huge inspiration for thrash metal bands that would come after the band, as well as a great deal of death metal bands. There is a lot of this through the album's 40-minute duration, but this track, and especially \"Deliver Us to Evil\", milk the heck out of this. This album is definitely a riff-fest. \n\nPaul Baloff's vocals give the word \"unique\" an entirely new meaning. He uses a style that takes obvious influence from punk and his shrieks are almost bone-chilling at times. I wouldn't say he's the best vocalist to come out of the thrash genre but he's surely up there in the list. \"A Lesson in Violence\" and the previously discussed title track showcase his shrieks of madness the best in my opinion. I'm aware that vocals are technically an instrument but here, they are even more highlighted as one. Without this man's pure hatred in vocal form, \"Bonded by Blood\" would probably not be nearly as maniacal an album. \n\nThe album's only real disappointing feature is the bass. Unfortunately, it's not loud enough. It's not that the playing is sub-par, because when you can actually hear it, it sounds pretty damn sick. It's just too quiet. It wouldn't bother me so much if it was totally inaudible. There are times you can hear it louder and clearer, but this just teases. It offers a taste of what should be more. The drums are fairly standard and I guess simple but I'm no drummer. So, in this case, I'm not too good a judge of character. The punk influence in the drumming, like the vocals, is fairly standard and lives up to the thrash sound. That seems to be the overall goal here. It fits the sound, and that's perfect!\n\nOverall, aside from the slight issue I have with bass volume, this album is top notch thrash. Exodus has produced many great albums but this was their first and also their best. Bang you head as if up from the dead, intense metal is all that you need!\n",
        "\nDoes anybody know why Exodus always have shitty artworks? It began with \"Fabulous Disaster\" and with regard to the cover of \"Blood In Blood Out\", there seems to be no end in sight. \"Impact Is Imminent\" does not represent an exception; guess it's time to describe the music, isn't it? First off, the fourth full-length of Gary Holt's wrecking crew is much more metal than its predecessor. Half-baked fillers like \"Low Rider\" are unimaginable in the context of this album which does not suffer from any needless cover version. \"Impact Is Imminent\" is pure thrash.\n\nRight from the beginning, Holt and Hunolt swing the axes if there is no tomorrow. John Tempesta, who has replaced Tom Hunting behind the drums, spares the costs for the fitness studio while maltreating his kit in a furious manner. Exodus are not suspected of choosing a lukewarm approach only because of the fact that the album is released by the company giant EMI / Capitol. With the obstinate behaviour of untouchable fanatics, they use their entire arsenal of thrash weapons. Too bad that the production is a rather harmless weapon. On the one hand, it creates a dense and fairly sinister atmosphere due to its comparatively dull mix. Even \"The Lunatic Parade\", which provides - in hindsight - the predictable link between \"The Toxic Waltz\" and \"Blacklist\", does not show a relatively funny side of the band. On the other hand, the sound lacks of differentiation and clarity. Sharp riffs are usually the feature that shapes thrash albums. But \"Impact Is Imminent\" follows another strategy and attacks the listener in a clunky yet very vehement manner.\n\nDue to the increased share of thrashing components, Holt and his escorts have the element of surprise on their side. The unexpected brutality of the opening title track is a breathtaking beacon for the audience. Of course, the band does not only focus on sheer velocity, but the number of high speed parts is a clear statement. Apart from the cynical opener, I could list the rapid ending of \"Heads They Win (Tails You Lose)\" in this context as well as the last two songs of the album. \"Changing of the Guard\" is one of these two pieces. It touches my Teutonic heart, because its lyrics deal with the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall. But the lyrics are not solely correlated to the reunification of Germany. Ceaucescu, the last dictator of Romania, and his likewise criminal wife are also expressly mentioned. \"With their execution, so ends the tyranny / Two bullets from a rifle set the people free\" - this sounds easy, but it took much more to change the situation in Europe. However, it has changed and that's the main thing. \"Thrash Under Pressure\", the closer of the album, does not think about politics. This anthem to the sub genre is just an intensive eruption of high velocity. Well done, although I regret that its playtime of two and a half minutes is too short.\n\nNevertheless, my personal favourite is not among the fast-paced songs. The riffing of \"Only Death Decides\" makes this mid-tempo bulldozer to a devastating giant. Don't be irritated by the less rapid approach. It does not mean that Exodus are willing to offer a less violent tune and lines like \"Misery, disaster, catastrophe / Exactly how you knew the end would be\" underline their intention. The riffs draw the listener into the song in a matter of seconds and confront him with the devastating summary of his useless life. No doubt, this track is a sonic authority. \"Within the Walls of Chaos\" does not fully achieve the quality level of \"Only Death Decides\", but its riffs drag across the floor in a hurtful manner. Without question, this track is also impressive due to its epic configuration.\n\nPerhaps it is an exaggeration to say that each and every piece of \"Impact is Imminent\" develops its unmistakeable facets. They rather stand shoulder to shoulder like uniformed members of a successful sports team during a photo shooting. And just like real athletes, they are bursting with strength. I would have never imagined that such an album could be followed by a lame duck, but \"Force of Habit\" proved the opposite. Anyway, let's close the cycle. At the beginning of the review, I mentioned the bad covers of Exodus albums, but the back of the CD version takes the bun. It is identical to that of the vinyl edition with the effect that the printed lyrics look like the excrements of a fly that has suffered from diarrhoea. Bad luck for the CD generation.\n",
        "\nSome musicians say that it is more difficult to write a simple rocker than to pen a complex number. I don't know whether they are right. Yet it cannot be denied that Exodus would have been well advised to tackle less excessive song structures than those that characterise the overall picture of the second part of their exhibition. I admit that it would be too imprecise to say that the band is running out of ideas. The album is based on a certain number of gripping songs, but a lot of pieces lack of compactness and concision. The tunes offer many playgrounds for Holt and Altus to celebrate their skills and they do it without showing any signs of tiredness. Nevertheless, the total result does not make my heart beat faster. Under such circumstances, it is an ironic twist of fate that exactly one of the slowest pieces increases my heart rate.\n\n\"Nanking\" - the name of the Chinese city is one of the synonyms for the horrors of the world wide crimes against humanity during the middle of the last century. Historians tell us that 200.000 civilians and prisoners of war were killed by the Japanese invaders. Only a German merchant, John Rabe, offered a place of refuge for a few hundred civilians. Today a monument in Nanking remembers his name and it seems that he was a good Nazi. Yes, the combination of these two words may sound strange, but I also know some people that speak of strong Avantasia albums. This is totally unbelievable as well. Anyway, Exodus capture the atmosphere of absolute atrocity in an excellent manner and Dukes delivers his best vocal performance ever. His voice reflects desperation, bewilderment and scorn in a terrific manner. A filigree guitar line meets devastating riffs, the slow drums underline the hopeless situation of the victims and the song constantly grows: the stomping verses lead to the dramatic bridge and the brilliant chorus mirrors the bestiality of the occupiers. A shiver runs down my spine whenever I listen to this metallic history lesson.\n\nHowever, it goes without saying that Exodus have penned some fast-paced bullets as well. Especially the first half of the album is equipped with rapidly beating drums that accompany fascinating riffs. Built on this fundament, outbursts of hate like the opener or \"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\" demonstrate the power of the formation that seemingly doesn't intend to retire. These explosive numbers are meticulously constructed, no doubt about it. Yet they are a little bit too long. Monumental patterns and straight thrash metal are not the closest friends and excessive instrumental parts do not always increase the degree of intensity. But don't get me wrong, the agility and the drive of Holt's violent clique achieve a formidable level. Even slightly less rabid pieces like \"Downfall\" hit the bull's eye. Too bad that the co-founders of thrash have passed their zenith after the seventh track, the aforementioned \"Nanking\". Perhaps they would haven been well advised to concentrate on the creation of an album with a playtime of 40 minutes instead of striving for the construction of an acoustic monster.\n\nThe further pieces commute between comparatively exciting and fairly boring. Some gruesome moments are also included. The bridge of \"Democide\", for instance, suffers from one of the weakest vocal lines in the history of Exodus. Yet quite apart from the details, these songs are somewhat exhausting. Some good riffs meet partially excessive song structures and get lost in these patterns. No, the tunes don't suffer from labyrinthine configurations. Nevertheless, a clear leitmotif is not identifiable. Accordingly, the transparent and very harsh production of \"Exhibit B\" is the most outstanding characteristic of these pieces. Yet surprisingly, this doesn't apply for the final track. \"Devil's Teeth\" is no hidden diamond, but it brings the overlong album to a good conclusion.\n",
        "\nDo we really need to discuss whether musicians have the right to modify the style of their music? It is not forbidden by law and anything else is a matter of personal taste. There is only one small restriction. We, the fans, are the backbone of the scene and none of us started to listen to non-conform bands only to see how they get more and more commercial. Having said that, I do not see a reason to condemn Exodus for the songs on the here presented album. They do not exactly follow genuine thrash patterns, but they definitely cannot be blamed for sounding commercial. This does not mean that each and every track attracts my interest. The meaningless \"As It Was, as It Soon Shall Be\" is obviously written by Mr. No-Idea and Doc Superfluous and seems to be the late American answer to the terrible \"The Nothing Song\" (the name says it all) of Grinder, a German thrash battalion of the mid/late eighties. But some other tracks do not hesitate to crush your skull and they can rely on the extremely brutal production. This sound comes as no surprise, because Andy Sneap was responsible for the engineering and he is, from my point of view, the present grand master of thrash metal productions - together with Waldemar Sorychta, of course.\n\nThe violent mix emphasises the best moments of the songs. Its robotic precision, its cynical coldness and its contemptuous harshness offer the right surrounding for the bone-dry snare drum and the devastating belligerence of the guitars. The effective riffs of \"Funeral Hymn\", for instance, shine in full glory while benefitting from the brutal sound. Inter alia due to the ominous guitar work at its beginning and because of its interesting composition pattern, the song belongs to the brightest shining stars of the album. The following \"Children of a Worthless God\" is definitely no less exciting. Rob Dukes doesn't mince his words. \"Follow us blindly or die like a dog / Blood mixed with sand for this holy war / Your savior' s a killer, you die for Allah / You are all children of a worthless God\" - I really don't know whether the 72 virgins like this kind of lyrics, but Dukes seems to be of the opinion that subtle nuances are just irksome. Needless to say that he contributes to the infernal overall appearance in a prominent position. He has decided to play the part of the unfriendly asshole and he does it very convincingly. Honestly speaking, I am not surprised that he fully identifies with this role.\n\nLeaving these great pieces out of account, I am sorry to inform you that the remaining tracks cannot cause the same impact. The title track, for example, is a good song, but why was it necessary to design it with a length of more than ten minutes? Apart from its excessive configuration, it provides triumphant riffing after 7:40 minutes. The guitar emerges from the brutal chaos and scores with sharp and dynamic catchiness. A brilliant part, but unfortunately embedded in a less excellent song. \"The Garden of Bleeding\" also cannot claim a top position in the ranking of the band's elaborations. It comes as the epitome of sonic gruffness, no more, no less. Anyway, it makes no sense to browse through each and every song. I have already mentioned the nadir of the album in the first and its highlights in the second paragraph. All other tracks have their moments while lacking from excessiveness or suffering from a mild form of compositional inability. The band is not able to exploit its strengths in a completely convincing manner. No doubt, their debut will remain unrivalled eternally, but the here presented exhibition with its fairly modern grasp of thrash shows a slightly worrying performance level.\n",
        "\nThe third work of a band is usually regarded as the \"make it or break it\" album. But \"Fabulous Disaster\" does not clearly tend to right or wrong. Instead, it holds a couple of intriguing riff attacks, but it also contains some unappetizing farts. One might have thought that the crummy cover artwork represents the worst detail of the album, but I am speaking of much more serious problems. Do you want to know my interpretation of the album's title? Some songs are fabulous, some are a disaster. However, first of all, I would like to draw your attention on the jewels of the full-length.\n\nThe title track is a real monster and belongs to the best songs of their entire oeuvre. Despite the expressive vocal performance of Zetro, the \"H-Team\", Holt and Hunold, offers the most fascinating part. Their solos after the first chorus lead directly to somersaulted riff cascades that get more and more intensive. The variations of the song's main riff demonstrate the energetic force of the entire genre in a glorious way. This track and especially the worthy opener carry on the approach of \"Pleasures of the Flesh\". These songs are driven by the belligerence and restlessness of the band and draw the listener into the album. The B side also starts with two thrash detonations. The cross-generational \"Like Father, Like Son\", equipped with much more nightmarish lyrics than all these ridiculous \"I kill all Christians\"-songs of some black metal scatterbrains, and \"Corruption\" are replete with cutting riffs. The lyrics of the latter also holds a remarkable line (\"shove it up your ass where the sun ain't shining\" - really?) Too bad that the band failed to offer consistently songs of this quality.\n\nThe cover of \"Low Rider\", thank God, I don't know the original version, seems to be performed by drunken weekend musicians. Any elements of thrash metal do not show up. Guess it was the soundtrack for a hula hoop session in the rehearsal room of the band. Swing your hip, if you really feel the urge to do it, but first make sure that the earplugs are seated properly. \"Cajun Hell\" also fails to hit the mark. In accordance with the lyrics, the music conveys a swampy feeling. Some casual riffs valorise the tune, but it lacks of power and determination. Not to mention the last two tracks of the album that fail to enrich the catalogue of Exodus. Inconspicuous and without outstanding characteristics, these tunes just pass by without leaving a trace. I cannot believe that the guys themselves did not realize their mediocre quality. Or could it be the case that I am wrong? Maybe this is the problem, because I also do not highly appreciate \"The Toxic Waltz\", although the vast majority of Exodus fans seems to love exactly this stomping piece. Irrespective of some mid-paced songs on \"Pleasures of the Flesh\", \"The Toxic Waltz\" became the most prominent track of the group that did not focus on sheer velocity. Don't ask me why. In my humble opinion, the term \"acceptable\" describes this darling of the public sufficiently...\n\n...and the same goes for the production. It appears to be incorrect to say that the mix lacks of penetrating power, because back in 1989, I was fine with the album's sound. From today's perspective, however, it leaves a fairly antiquated and frumpy impression. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that friends of Exodus must have this full-length, because four of its tunes show the institution in top form. But if you are not especially focused on the works of the band, you better write dozens of other thrash albums on your shopping list.\n",
        "\nExodus started their long awaited comeback with an album whose production did not flirt with the sound of the eighties. In terms of its mix, \"Tempo of the Damned\" emerged as a full-length that stood with both feet in the present. The vehemence of the technical implementation worked as an indicator for the musical direction. Forget the lukewarm / shitty / experimental / commercial / overlong / boring (please make your selection) \"Force of Habit\" that caused the implosion of the band in 1992. \"Tempo of the Damned\", recorded with four fifths of the \"Fabulous Disaster\" line-up, brought back the ugly ferocity of Exodus and played its part on the threshold of the new age of thrash.\n\nAdmittedly, after the long period of silence, it boggled the mind that Exodus had not been able to design a full-length without fillers. Gary Holt and his crew were clever enough to kick off the output with some effective and varying pieces, but we were clever as well and therefore we realized that they had put a small number of mediocre pieces in the middle of the album. Especially the overlong \"Culling the Herd\" and the primitively stomping \"Sealed with a Fist\" didn't offer amazing twists and turns or anything else that could be praised for its extraordinary charm. Anyway, it is surely small-minded to take offence at (more or less) minor details and I don't want to cry just because of two predictable pieces. The principal thing was that Exodus were back and they presented a couple of formidable pieces. Except for US-American patriots, everybody received the provocative opener \"Scar Spangled Banner\" with open arms and open ears, because its introducing riff demonstrated the regained power of Exodus immediately. However, the best was yet to come.\n\nHolt had penned some really exciting songs that shined with brilliant choruses, compelling riffs and a lot of pressure. \"War Is My Shepherd\" killed with vile leads and its concise bridge resulted in a heavyweight chorus. The viciously creeping \"Blacklist\" offered a vindictive chorus and the drilling guitars showed no signs of mercy as well. By the way, inter alia this song revealed the skill of Zetro to implement opportune vocal lines. Moreover, his performance was a forming element of the album. Seemingly filled to the brim with bad feelings, he covered the whole range: from hate to aggression, from scorn to desperation. The last element characterised my personal highlight, the titanic \"Forward March\". In alignment with the lyrical content, Zetro's screaming showed desperate and combative elements. Apart from his contribution, each single part of the multilayered track was enthrallingly designed and the chorus with its gloomy guitars was the cherry on the cake. \n\nThe band also served a special titbit: \"Impaler\", a previously unreleased song of their early days. Its sawing riff at the beginning whispered \"Do you remember Bonded by Blood?\" and the entire title, co-written by Kirk Hammett and Tom Hunting, emitted a touch of the pioneering years of thrash metal. Although the following title track lived up to its name, it was far away from creating a comparable degree of magic. Nevertheless, a good track and a strong ending of the album, if we ignore the banally performed AC/DC cover version. Don't mess with the Young brothers, that's all I can say in this context. (And the same applies for \"Overdose\" which was released on \"Fabulous Disaster, because it just shows that Bon Scott's charisma remains untouched.) Anyway, despite its minor weaknesses, \"Tempo of the Damned\" sent important signals and marked a milestone for the revival of thrash metal.\n",
        "\n\"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\" was the first album with Rob Dukes and, worse still, Zetro Souza was not the only guy who had left the band. Tom Hunting and Rick Hunolt, forty percent of the godlike line-up of \"Bonded by Blood\", were no longer part of the institution, too. The general overhaul of Exodus' appearance was not without consequences. Dukes made full use of his aggressive voice while adding a brutalising touch to the sound of the band. It quickly became apparent that he had not the intention to be a copycat of his predecessor. Unfortunately, his act of emancipation did not result in an outstanding vocal performance. While Zetro had always played the role of a poisonous dwarf, Dukes appeared as the violent asshole next door. Never charismatic or flexible, he spat out the words in a more or less monotonous manner. Okay, this unformed mass without neck did not ruin the whole record, but it remained a mystery to me why exactly Dukes had been chosen for the job vacancy. Band leader Holt should scrutinise his recruitment process.\n\nFrom today's perspective, the album belongs to the less prominent outputs of the thrash legend. This is only logical when taking a look at its song material. Gary Holt's creativity did not reach an outstanding level during the song-writing process. Of course, he is among the most talented composers of the thrash metal scene and it comes therefore as no surprise that \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\" avoids throwaway tracks. But I must also notice the fact that there is only one song that has the power to make my blood boil. Based on a drilling riff, the torrid \"Raze\" possesses an irresistible drive. Crowned with a concise chorus, this song is on a par with a great number of the band's early classics. Quite apart of its compositional class, the opener reveals another element of the album in a matter of seconds. The bass guitar is very well audible and it goes without saying that it contributes a very heavy element. The prominent role of the bass matches the antisocial shouting of Dukes and both components push the music of the formation to the next level of harshness and hostility. But was it desirable at all to sacrifice the previously dominating riffs for the sake of pure brutality? I don't think so.\n\nFortunately, the world is not only black or white. Holt's riffs are still a relevant factor, although they have lost some percent of their importance. The reason for this is easily explained. Each and every of the monolithic songs appears as a rock of granite with the effect that the entire work leaves not much room for technical subtleties. The new configuration of Exodus doesn't lack of energy, but its constant aggression endangers the dynamic of the compositions. For example, the heavyweight and mid-paced \"Shudder to Think\" reminds me of a slowly rolling bulldozer. Some might say that it just represents the next part of \"The Toxic Waltz\". Fair position, these guys are not totally wrong. Anyway, it's a good and fairly catchy song, only dynamic components - I have mentioned it before - are conspicuous by their absence. That's the fundamental problem of the album, if one assumes that a 75% output can suffer from fundamental problems at all. While being not able to vary the level of brutality, Exodus do not realize that the vapid face of boredom shows up occasionally. No doubt, some songs leave a good impression (without making us forget the sharp-witted pieces of their first two albums). \"Karma's Messenger\" kicks asses. It unites a memorable riff at the beginning with straight verses, before the memorably designed chorus and a strong instrumental part with great solos add the final polish. (Well, the 17 seconds between 3:09 and 3:26 seem to be adopted from Metallica's \"Creeping Death\", but that's no big deal.) The rapid title track also hits the mark, inter alia because of its compact configuration. \n\nIn contrast, the two overlong pieces must be branded as ambivalent, because their manageable substance does not justify the playing time. Further tracks do not meet my (high) expectations, but I am not alone in this. You will not find an Exodus fan whose most favourite song is \"Going Going Gone\" or \"44 Magnum Opus\", even if the poor guy doesn't know any other track of the group. Speaking of their best songs, I must think of their debut. \"Bang your head against the stage\" - of course, you know that this programmatic line is taken from its title track. Astonishingly, the massively produced \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\" prefers to bang the stage against your head while leaving the listener no possibility to control the vehemence of the collision. This is neither good or bad per se, nevertheless, one has to get used to the situation - and to the new line-up as well. Zetro come back, all is forgiven.\n",
        "\nExodus's Blood In Blood Out really surprised me when I bought it. It is by far the best thing they have done in years, at least since 2004, with the excellent Tempo of the Damned record. Perhaps, Blood In Blood Out could be the best since the debut, or maybe even better. It is clearly Exodus at their best.\n\nWhile Blood In Blood Out gets off to a slow start with the weird, hip hop influenced intro to \"Black 13\", the album really begins to pick up in terms of both speed and aggression. The title track is an ode to 80s thrash metal, complete with a reference to Paul Baloff, who is often seen as Exodus's best singer. It is definitely an intense all out thrasher, but it has a melodic solo featuring some great harmonies, almost reminding me of \"Salt the Wound\" from Exodus's most recent album with Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, Tempo of the Damned. \n\nAt times, Blood In Blood Out can be very angry. It's not like Tempo of the Damned, an album based off of pure anger, though. It seems more angry sometimes, though. There is contrast between the slightly more mellow parts, and the parts where Steve Souza screams his head off. \"Salt the Wound\", a catchy song featuring Kirk Hammett, has a relatively mellow vocal performance during the verses, but in the chorus, Zetro screams his head off in a way making death growls seem mellow.\n\nBlood In Blood Out is dominated by songs on the upper side of midtempo. For some reason, they don't feel slow or dragging. A dragging sound plagued Tempo of the Damned. Even the slowest songs are packed with intensity. \"Body Harvest\" and \"BTK\" are both on the slower side, but they both feature some of the album's most memorable sections. \"Body Harvest\" has a catchy groove to it, but not in a groove metal way. It's just very catchy thrash metal. \"BTK\" has some nice melodic parts, featuring Chuck Billy of Testament on backing vocals. It is even slower than \"Body Harvest\", but it still moves with intensity.\n\nShredding leads seem to be fairly common intros to the songs on Blood In Blood Out. \"Collateral Damage\", \"BTK\", and \"Wrapped in the Arms of Rage\" all have great lead intros. \"Wrapped in the Armes of Rage\" isn't as catchy as the rest of the album, but it contains some cool melodic sections. Still, it packs a thrash metal punch, like the rest of the album.\n\nThe guitar tone on Blood In Blood Out is one of the best tones in thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. While it has enough bass to make it heavy, it isn't lacking in midrange, and the treble cuts through the mix like a knife. It is very nice to hear thrash metal without the mids being scooped to a level of excess. This, paired with the immense technical skills of the guitarists, makes this a perfect album guitar wise.\n\nThe vocals on Blood In Blood Out are nothing short of the best vocals ever heard on an Exodus album. Zetro's voice ranges from a mellow, semi clean style, to an intense high scream. The best vocal delivery here is the \"when I rip you open\" line of \"Salt the Wound\". He sound extremely angry. I understand that his voice is not technically a growl, but it definitely has a nice, growling sound on the low end, and he can do some extremely high screaming (again, \"Salt the Wound\"). Upon first listen, my first thought was about the vocals.\n\nAlmost all of Blood In Blood Out was written with Rob Dukes in the band, and the songs sound like they were written for Rob Dukes to sing over in his quite annoying style. Don't get me wrong, he sounds great on Shovel Headed Kill Machine, but Zetro is far better. \"Collateral Damage\" stands out as the most Rob Dukes era sounding track on here. Still, Zetro manages to pull off sounding great with the song, while retaining his usual style. \"Body Harvest\" is the one song that I know of that was written with Zetro in the band. I believe that it was actually written by Zetro at the last minute upon Gary Holt's request. The song really stands out lyrically. I'm assuming that Rob Dukes write the rest of the lyrics. If this is true, he did write some great lines on \"Salt the Wound\", and \"BTK\", which actually would sound a lot like \"Altered Boy\" if it had Dukes on vocals. Fortunately, it doesn't. \"Body Harvest\" seems to be the real standout here if you go by lyrics. There are a few nice and disturbing lines in the song, referencing organ removal for black market sale. It's actually a bit death metal lyrically, but it still retains the energy of thrash metal. It also happens to be one of the most catchy songs on the album, it's unforgettable chorus will most likely be in your head for a while after listening to Blood In Blood Out.\n\nBlood In Blood Out was released just over a year ago. Within this short amount of time, it has already become a classic. This is absolute proof that Exodus have once again reached their peak. They still sound like the same band that released such classics as Bonded By Blood, Pleasures of the Flesh, and Impact is Imminent. Blood In Blood Out shall join the ranks of these albums. I think that every metalhead needs to own Blood In Blood Out. If you don't own it, you are really missing out on some great fucking thrash metal.\n",
        "\nLet There Be Blood is a much maligned effort from Exodus, and with good reason. It is a re-recording of their seminal and beloved debut album Bonded by Blood, as the cover art and title suggest. It is by no means their worst release on a musical level, but that doesn't take too much effort as the hard work has already been done and a lot of Exodus' latter day output is terrible. It is also one of the more redundant and pointless examples of re-recording old songs. It isn't as thoroughly useless as Testament's First Strike Still Deadly as the entire thing features a new vocalist, and it does turn out a lot better musically than Anthrax's The Greater of Two Evils as the band stick much closer to the originals here. Nevertheless, this is rather skip-worthy whether or not you're familiar with the original album.\n\nThe main reason for this re-recording's existence according to the band is to give the material the benefit of modern recording techniques and production. This is the one positive these versions have over the originals; the songs sound notably heavier and punchier than the old songs. The issue however is that despite sounding heavier, clearer and louder than before the music is nowhere near as violent as it once was. The instrumentation on this album is delivered with a lot of faithfulness to the originals but it all sounds very tired and forced, somehow. Not helping this is that the production is so slick and the guitars are so chunky and muddy that it strips the riffs of a lot of the abrasion and nimbleness they once had; they don't sound nearly as aggressive as they once were. The guitar is also tuned a lot lower than before, making the riffs sound not quite right (the first few seconds of 'A Lesson In Violence' are a prime example.) Other songs here are played more slowly than the originals, most notably 'And Then there Were None' which turns the song into a boring groove metal chugger and makes it sound off and wrong. The solos are mostly faithful to the originals and serve as the bright spots here, but they aren't enough to save the songs.\n\nOf course, much worse affected than the instrumentation is the vocal performance. In place of the dearly departed icon Paul Baloff, Exodus' then current vocalist Rob Dukes takes the helm. I'll admit that I prefer him to Zetro (but that's more because I find Zetro to be a comically bad sounding vocalist) but he is certainly not the one to fill in for Paul. In place of the original album's totally unhinged, unbelievably aggressive shrieks and shouts we get a very generic metalcore/groove metal/hardcore yell. He is by no means bad and does fit the modern-sounding music well but it's not as if his approach shoots for a different feel than Paul's - he goes straight for aggression and volume, meaning he has to be compared directly to Paul's performance as he did the same thing; and in every regard Rob delivers an inferior performance.\n\nAnd that is the critical flaw of this release; even with modern production this is an entirely inferior facsimile of the original that doesn't offer anything but decayed remains of what Bonded by Blood did. Had this music been novel this would be a pretty decent if unspectacular modern thrash album that showed a lot of promise, but instead it sits in the shadow of what it copies and offers very little that's new, and what it does do differently harms the music a lot. The only real bright spot here is 'Hell's Breath', a song that never made it onto the original album; this version does sound considerably better than the rough demo from 1983. Downloading that song and skipping out on the rest of this is the way to go, as nothing else here is worth listening to - just find the original album instead.\n",
        "\nThere seems to exist an unwritten law. It stipulates that there comes a day in the life of each and every appreciated band when it releases a more or less gruesome album. In terms of American thrash metal, these flops have names like \"Diabolus in Musica\", \"Souls of Black\" or - you guessed it - \"Force of Habit\". But however, let\u00b4s face the truth.\n\nThe album clocks in at almost 69 minutes. Such an extraordinary quantity can be a sign of creativity. But it can also indicate helplessness. How many tracks do we have to record so that everybody finds at least two or three songs that meet his taste? This seemed to be the initial question for the band during the production process. In my humble opinion, Exodus delivered only one number that could be compared with their old classics. They hide it on the last position as if it was suitable to damage their reputation. This positioning showed their twisted thinking. In fact, exactly the opposite was true. \"Feeding Time at the Zoo\" stood in the tradition of frenetic songs like \"Deranged\" or \"Parasite\" and was the light at the end of the tunnel. Its sharp riffs and speedy drums merged to an aggressive thrasher. The amazing guitar solos also made an important contribution. Due to the vehemence of this conclusion, it seemed to be a forgotten track of the \"Impact is Imminent\" session. Anyway, this song also emphasized my annoyance, because it proved that Exodus were actually still able to compose gripping speed metal eruptions.\n\nBut they preferred to record completely worthless cover tracks of the Stones or Elvis Costello. And I am sorry to inform you that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Lame mid-tempo tracks lengthened the album in a nerve-shattering way. The more melodic approach did not work and Exodus found itself caught between a rock and a hard place. Their name was associated with pure thrash massacres, although they also had already offered slightly progressive tunes like \"Chemi-Kill\" or robust songs such as \"The Toxic Waltz\". But \"Force of Habit\" did not only suffer from too much foreign influences like wind instruments or slide guitars. The majority of the compositions just lacked of quality. For example, the chorus of the title track did not add any value to the boring piece and the same applied for the amateurish chorus of \"Fuel for the Fire\". The fairly solid riffs failed to create an intense aura, not only because of the low average speed of the tracks. An additional factor was that the songs were too long. Who needed expanded songs like \"Count Your Blessings\" (seven and a half minutes) with its horribly squeaking guitars or \"Me, Myself & I\" (five minutes)? Admittedly, the longest song of the album, \"Architect of Pain\", was among the better tracks of this record. Due to its - you guessed it again - mid-tempo approach, it bobbed up and down like an abandoned rowboat in a lonely bay. But it scored with its dark aura and the passionate vocals of Zetro who gave us an insight into the life of Marquis de Sade. But it did not take a lot to belong to the \"highlights\". Songs like the miserable \"When It Rains It Pours\" demonstrated that impressively. Once again, the chorus seemed to be the work of absolute beginners and I had to puke in view of the infelicitous rock\u00b4n roll elements of the song.\n\nFinally, I did not like the production, although it did not suffer from major deficiencies. I have to admit that my aversion against the mix was probably just the consequence of my disappointment about the unattractive and partly imbecile compositions. Of course, every band has the right to change its style. But this does not mean that this is a good idea in each individual case. Worse still, Exodus did not impress with a new style. They just offered (too) many songs that had nothing in common except their mediocrity. No doubt, it was time for a break.\n",
        "\nSome years ago, the editors of the German magazine Rock Hard published their ranking of the best thrash metal albums of all times. Of course, these rankings are always dubious. But be that as it may, the winner was \"Bonded by Blood\". (Second place went - surprise, surprise - to \"Reign in Blood\".) With regard to this selection, there is not much that can go wrong. No doubt that the debut of Exodus is definitely at least one of the best thrash records in the history of the phenomenal genre. It will remain a reference work for every musician who wants to create thrash compositions which are free from external influences. Even 30 years after its release, \"Bonded by Blood\" offers an unconsumed aura of ferocity and malignancy. This aura is inter alia based on the performance of a man who left the band much too soon. I do not want to use superlatives in an inflationary way. But from my point of view, Paul Baloff - rest in peace - had the most malicious voice of all thrash vocalists. He expressed all that is evil. It seemed as if he was constantly in danger of losing his self-control. But in reality, he followed a clear line, at least on the here presented work. \"Bonded by Blood\" features the vocals of a man who remains concentrated and his emphasis of the single lines matches perfectly with the atmosphere of each and every sonic frontal assault. Commuting between a cynical approach and sheer aggression, his singing ennobles the superb riffs of the \"H-Team\", the guitarists Hunolt and Holt. Additionally, the rarely occuring pinpoint background vocals further increase the dynamic of the tunes.\n\nSpeaking of the riffs: they sound sharp, rapid and harsh. At the same time, and this is the crucial factor, they were innovative, groundbreaking and irresistible. Back in 1985, the same applied to the whole thrashing genre and I guess this is the decisive reason why all these glorious albums of the mid-eighties will never lose their status. Never ever! They document the omnipresent pioneering spirit of this time. It inspired talented bands like Exodus, Slayer and Possessed - to name only some of the most important - in a very significant manner. But this spirit cannot be preserved for a long time. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the stimulating effect of \"Bonded by Blood\" is rarely matched. In my opinion, its nine tracks form the best thrash debut of all times and the album belongs to the most energizing records of the genre. And this energy is evoked by the riffs - and so the cycle closes.\n\nBy taking into consideration the compactness of every single song, the whole album has the sustainable effect of a well-considered slap in the face. \"Exodus\" (the track) marks the prime example in terms of directness and aggression. Its brutal lyrics are completely stupid; nevertheless, they cannot affect the joy of listening to this straightforward torpedo. Despite its raging violence, it shines with the right amount of catchiness, not only because of its conservative verse-chorus-verse pattern. But \"Exodus\" is just the king of kings. The similarly configured tracks, for example \"Piranha\" or the final crusher \"Strike of the Beast\", as well as the more interlaced songs such as \"Deliver Us to Evil\", can compete with the perfect band anthem. But also the maliciously creeping \"No Love\", which speeds up during the homicidal solos, hits the bull\u00b4s eye. Despite these slightly differentiated song structures, \"Bonded by Blood\" possesses a very good flow. Furthermore, it fascinates with its homogeneity. But it goes without saying that the homogeneous overall impression constitutes only one of the many advantages of this milestone. In particular due to the excellent sound of the guitars, the perfect production is no less important. Finally, the great number of divine moments - for instance, listen to the fast-paced chorus of \"Deliver Us to Evil\" which contrasts with the other parts of the song in an outstanding manner - puts the album in a class of its own. During the last three decades, its liveliness has not faded. Due to this situation, it does not matter that the lyrical content is either naive (\"fists are in the air, banging everywhere\") or sick (\"we rape and murder your wife\").\n\nWell, from my point of view, the comparatively lame \"Master of Puppets\" does not fall under the thrash category. But some might say that Metallica\u00b4s first two full-lengths are the most important thrash albums of all times. I disagree. Quite apart from my personal favorite \"Hell Awaits\", I think that the blood brothers \"Bonded By Blood\" and \"Reign in Blood\" had the greatest influence on the worldwide scene. While Slayer\u00b4s third full-length glitters with sheer aggression, the neckbreaking debut of Exodus kills with style. To sum up, its weapons are the cruel yet memorable melodies which are formed by the sensational riffs, the howling guitars (especially during the fantastic solos), the nifty tempo variations and, of course, Baloff\u00b4s performance. It is therefore a matter of personal taste which one you prefer. I am undecided.\n",
        "\nAfter a long departure from the band, vocalist Steve (Zetro) Souza is back in the Exodus, and he absolutely kills it. Blood in Blood Out is the strongest record Exodus has put out since Tempo of the Damned released back in 2004. Now with Zetro back in the band, Exodus is as strong as ever and they released one hell of an album. \n\nThe best word to describe this album is angry. The guitars are furiously riffing throughout the majority of the album. They keep a similar tone to that of Tempo of the Damned. Even with such furious guitars, Tom Hunting manages to keep up with insane fills. The slowest song on the album is \"BTK\", but it doesn't feel slow at all. With this album, Exodus returns to their roots. This album feels nothing like it's three predecessors (not counting Let There Be Blood). It seems that the main goal of this album was to put out an angry, fast, Exodus record. Some of the weaker points on this album were \"Body Harvest\", and \"Wrapped in the Arms of Rage\". These were by no means bad songs. The chorus of \"Body Harvest \" was great, but these songs just seem to bore me. \n\nYou will either love or hate the vocals on this album. I've heard Zetro's voice being compared to a banshee. Personally, I think Zetro is absolutely killer. The guitar work is outstanding. The amount of riffs they manage to put in this record amazes me. The bass is always present. Especially when the other instruments quiet down, and the bass just grooves along, the bass really stands out. And for arguably the best part of this record beside from the vocals: the drums. Tom Hunting is nothing short of amazing on this record. The last song on the record is \"Food for the Worms\". The drumming in this song is top notch. If you're a drummer, this song may just give you wet dreams. The drum work on \"Food for the Worms\" is so amazing, I thought it was a drum machine. \n\nOverall, the album is very strong. It's more Exodus. They keep their signature sound and formulas but change it just enough to put out an awesome record. The album doesn't do too much in the experimental field, but that's not always a bad thing.\n",
        "\nWith Rob Dukes out of the picture and Steve 'Zetro' Souza back in the band, expectations for \"Blood In, Blood Out\" were rather high for many Exodus fans, including myself. That's not including those \"NO BAND MEMBER = NO BAND\" Rob Dukes fanboys. It's one thing to prefer Rob over Steve, but are we going to forget how unique Zetro's vocals are and how great \"Tempo Of The Damned\" was? Anyways, with Zetro being my personal favorite singer of the two and songs that didn't eclipse the 7 minute mark unlike the past couple of releases, I was definitely looking forward to what the band could pull from their sleeves. \n\nAs far as sound goes, it's not a completely original and fresh sounding album for Exodus, but with the overall production sounding the beefiest since \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\", it's certainly more pleasant to the ears than those \"Exhibit\" records. The guitars and drums have a lot of punch to them, the bass is pretty much the same that it's ever sounded, and as far as vocals go, I think this is the best that Zetro has ever sounded in this band's history. You could argue that maybe he sounded more evil on \"Tempo Of The Damned\", but here, he sounds more pissed off than ever, and I love it. The screams on the track \"Salt The Wound\" alone go to show that Steve's voice has aged like fine wine. \n\nOf course, you can't just have solid sound quality and production for a good album, what matters most is the quality of the music. To cut to the chase, if you enjoyed the past modern Exodus albums, you should really dig this one too. The album feels much more punk-ish in tone and not as deadly serious and dark as the \"Exhibit\" albums, and it benefits greatly from that tone. Gary's speedy and groovy riffs combined with Steve's pissed off vocals manage to give this album it's own attitude and not sound like a carbon copy of anything else they've done. It's very energetic and fun to listen to overall. \n\nAlthough Exodus is mainly a thrash band, they're also known for incorporating grooves into their music every now and then, and the track \"BTK\" shows that off nicely. While not quite as memorable as \"Throwing Down\" and not nearly as catchy as \"Shudder To Think\", it's still a great song and certainly better than \"As It Was, As It Soon Shall Be\". They even inject a little bit of melody into the music, mostly noticeable on \"Wrapped In The Arms Of Rage\" and \"My Last Nerve\". Sadly, they're probably the weakest moments on the album and just so happen to be in the 2nd and least memorable half of this 11 track beast. With that being said, the songs aren't bad and neither is the 2nd half in general, I just don't think they stand out nearly as much as the 1st half. The transition from fast and punk-y music to more groovy and melodic music doesn't work as well as you would want it to, but at least they end the album on a pretty damn good note with \"Food For The Worms\", which boasts one of the fastest and craziest sounding riffs on the entire record. I wish it didn't drag out as long as it does when it fades out near the end, but it's a small gripe I have for an overall solid song. \n\nAll in all, Exodus did a damn good job with \"Blood In Blood Out\". It's great to have Zetro back, as he sounds absolutely killer from start to finish. Although he may be my favorite thing about this album, it's also great to have solid musicianship by everyone else combined with great production and some tasty riffs by Gary Holt himself. Say what you want about Exodus, but the man knows how to riff. \n\nHighlights: \nBlood In Blood Out \nSalt The Wound \nBody Harvest \nBTK\n",
        "\nThe tenth full-length album from Bay Area thrash legends Exodus, \u201cBlood In, Blood Out,\u201d finally gets things back on track in their more modern phase by getting the goods delivered without too many hang-ups.\n\nThis deep in their career, it\u2019s pretty easy to determine what\u2019s going to be found in one of their releases. Starting right from the start with dynamic and impressive guitar playing, there\u2019s plenty of enjoyment to be found here as the more modern-era formation of the band is given plenty of room to play here. Loaded up with a heavy groove base that employs plenty of vicious and violent patterns throughout here, there\u2019s a strong thrash formation built off that groove that turns the tracks into ravenous assaults of full-throttle efforts displaying a dexterous series of lead changes and variations that border on the technical side such is the amount of changes and the speed with which it\u2019s all handled which is immensely impressive. Plus, the groove base here keeps these twisting, swirling blasts of thrash all intense, urgent and quite forceful in their approach which is quite a solid base to launch a furious attack off of. Likewise, they can manage quite well in the album\u2019s steady mid-tempo paces which ease off the thrash throttle to allow those tight grooves into more prominent roles in the main arrangements which is quite nice to offer that variation whilst still staying in league with their main sound in recent years.\n\nAfter the guitar-work, there\u2019s a slew of highly-enjoyable elements at play here with their rhythm section here. Still employing that utterly charging and clanking bass-tone, there\u2019s a heavy, loud thumping sound here which is quite well suited to this level of ravenous thrash assault. Firmly utilized against the violent groove riffing style here by following that lead yet still containing the bouncy rhythms for the more traditional thrash realms here, the bass-work is nicely complex and offers a rather thrilling backbone to the rest of the pounding arrangements featured throughout this. Following that lead is the rather dynamic and explosive drumming that keeps on pounding along to the beat of the intense and vicious tracks, featuring enough here to really get a lot of enjoyable elements. Flowing with pummeling double-bass runs to off-set the vicious grooves while offering a dynamic, hard-hitting pattern of violent patterns to compliment the generous thrash runs in place here, this is profoundly dynamic and explosive offering that has a decidedly cool mixture of old-school and new-school mentalities. For the old-school, it offers the kind of thunderous rhythms and dexterous blasts that feel right at home in the more ravenous traditions found in the eighties which allowed for the same type of varied tempos on the full-throttle thrash that was on offer there. Placating the modern scene, it\u2019s vicious, impactful and features the intensity favored there which is a fantastic cross-selection of material that really works well here and produces a lot to really like here.\n\nOne of their more overall balanced and urgent records, this one really has a lot to like here. One of the biggest and most detrimental arguments that could be made against the recent reformation years was the use of convoluting the arrangements unnecessarily, often-times simply throwing in tons of riffs to show off their complexity and ingenious mastery of the arrangements without doing anything of note for the song itself beyond adding excess length. This effectively made those albums too dense for their own good, containing a lot of killer work but it all got lost in the sea of overlong arrangements and useless riffing, whereas this one manages to correct that fatal flaw by honing in the arrangements to more tolerable lengths. Rather than being long for arbitrary reasons, here the lengthier variants aren\u2019t as long and excessive as they were before and tend to offer more in league with the song itself by twisting the main riffs around slightly to offer a variety of moods and contours without doing this with endless riff-after-riff that aren\u2019t based on that main rhythm. It makes for a more intense and rabid assault by keeping things more streamlined and simplified. As well, this also brings into focus the biggest factor involved here which is the return to form of the legendary lead-singer who\u2019s back in the vocal seat which amounts for an utterly frantic and schizoid performance here that\u2019s got all the makings of their glory years and matching the music more than ever before. Altogether, the performances on here offer a lot of incredible work throughout.\n\nThe first half to this offers a solid glimpse of the band at their best. Opener \u2018Black 13\u2019 experiments with distorted electronic guitars ripping through industrialized noise and flowing into charging, intense riffing and thunderous drumming blazing with the intense riff-work and pounding rhythms featured into a steady groove into the frantic, charging solo section into the thrashing finale for a dynamic, intense first impression. The title track offers rattling drumming and thrashing guitars running through rabid patterns with vicious, frenzied riff-work and utterly pounding drumming taking the tight patterns and furious tempos through heavy grooves of the solo section back through the charging, thrashing finale for a vicious thrashing highlight. \u2018Collateral Damage\u2019 features frenzied screaming leads and thumping drumming turn into barreling razor-wire riffing and pounding rhythms with furious paces based off the barreling leads running through full-throttle rhythms and pounding drum-blasts through the dexterous, spindly solo section and carrying through the frantic finale which easily makes this the albums\u2019 central highlight. Appropriate first-single \u2018Salt the Wound\u2019 starts with barreling riffing and thunderous drumming charge through groovy mid-tempo pace with plenty of charging leads and steady rhythms carrying the sterling grooves into the dynamic solo section with the vicious grooves continuing through the finale for an enjoyable break from the rousing thrash before it. Likewise, \u2018Body Harvest\u2019 uses barreling riff-work and dynamic drumming charge through groovy leads and stuttering drumming that carries the heavy rhythms and thumping groove variations along with the glorious gang-backing shouts into the steady, relaxed solo section with clanking bass-lines and heavy chugs running through the groovy finale for a vicious, brutal effort. \u2018BTK\u2019 gets swirling riff-work, groovy clanking bass-lines and pounding drumming work into a steady up-tempo thrashing groove laden with thumping rhythms and tight leads through the hard and clanking rhythms throughout the first half as the swirling grooves lead into the steady solo section into the solid finale for an overall enjoyable effort.\n\nThe second half here is slightly off from the first but still good enough to really work well here. \u2018Wrapped in the Arms of Rage\u2019 utilizes swirling razor-wire leads and thumping drumming to carry the heavy grooves and steady rhythms through stuttering mid-tempo paces with dexterous lead grooves swirling into the charging solo section and carrying through into the finale for a solid if unspectacular mid-tempo piece. The groovy \u2018My Last Nerve\u2019 offers pummeling mid-tempo groove riffs and thumping drum-blasts turn into steady mid-tempo charge with dexterous rhythms against the barreling leads and steady drumming that keeps this one heavy and intense through the up-front grooves leading through the soloing and into the extended finale, making this a more prototypical effort of their more recent efforts than their true thrash output. Continuing in that vein, \u2018Numb\u2019 features swirling groove patterns and dexterous drumming careen through up-tempo bouncy rhythms and clanking bass-lines that continue to offer frantic razor-wire grooves through the pummeling first half as the twisting riffs lead into the stellar solo section and on through the steady final half for another rousing effort. Keeping things vicious and intense, \u2018Honor Killings\u2019 uses stylish thrash riffing and pounding drumming twisting through technical riffs at vicious up-tempo patterns while the dynamic drum-blasts lead into the swirling mid-tempo paces full of swirling grooves flow into the fiery solo section and lead through the final half for a stellar and dynamic offering. Finally, \u2018Food for the Worms\u2019 gets thumping mid-tempo riffing and drum-work build into ravenous, vicious riffing scorching through the pummeling paces with plenty of intense rhythms and dexterous drum-beats to weave the frantic and intense arrangements along the bouncy up-tempo patterns fueling the charge into the final half for a fine and incredibly enjoyable end to this.\n\nFrankly, this is about as good as the band has sounded in years and fully rectifies the problems in their more recent offerings while still employing those influences with their old-school sound. It\u2019s not as impactful as their original works but is good enough for those that want a more dynamic return to form from those golden years as well as the ones who enjoyed their problematic-but-still solid recent offerings.\n",
        "\nFor many, the Exodus return match has been sketchy. Hit or miss if you will. Though things started off well enough with \"Tempo of the Damned\", it didn't seem as though many took to the more modern, groove-laden approach of both \"Atrocity Exhibitions\", nor Rob Dukes' vocal style. But both fate and Hell saw fit to give the fathers of thrash metal a second (third? Or fourth, even?) coming of \"Zetro\" and a new smattering of tracks in which to properly broadcast his latest ascension...\n\n\"Blood In, Blood Out\", for what it's worth, is able-bodied and straight-to-the-throat yet ultimately middle of the road. This release finds Exodus with the appeal of a band playing it safe versus being hungry for good and proper devastation, and seeing as they still have plenty to say with regard to all of life's various ills (religion, society, what have you), It leaves their musical stew so needing of that something extra. Yet riffs abound, the occasional melodic break rears its head (the minor key bridge in the title track and the low-end chugging section of \"Body Harvest\" were money, absolute money) and punishing rhythms send you into a bludgeoned tizzy, per usual with some of the best thrash out there, rewarding the listener when and where it counts (which isn't all that often). But it all feels rather...expected. Like we knew it would happen and, as a result, still hoped for more. That said, it would be best to not overlook such things, for it's still a decent rager that does its job, fairly well at that, and punches out when said job is done. A company man band, if that helps any. Quite a bit to enjoy, yet still needing that little extra stretch to be truly be among the best.\n\nThe mid-tempo pacing that makes up the majority of \"Blood In...\" takes some of the bite out of it, which is unfortunate seeing as, if more honing was had, this could have been a serious killer. But I suppose more precise violence is still something to appreciate versus clearing the target completely, for sometimes it works for the band's/album's benefit. T'would be tricky to appreciate the slow caress into oblivion that \"BTK\" provides if it came at you at triple-digit speeds and one single direction. But worst of all (for me, anyway), as I'm not all that well-versed in Zetro's vocal style from way back when, I couldn't help but not be bothered by his tone. A legend he may be, that's never in question, with him still putting a lot of oomph behind his odd, nasal rasp delivery and definitely sticking out from the rest of the group, but the majority of the time he felt too disengaged with the rest of the group, standing out yet not in the best possible way. Methinks it would have to be something to be used to going in, and those not in the know won't know what to make of it or what the fuss is all about. But maybe that's just me...?\n\nIn the end I was somewhat underwhelmed by this, knowing full well that Exodus could do better. They've proven that in the majority of their discography up to this point, But it's not a complete misfire in any way when taken as it is, yet compared to other works, both theirs and other modern thrash albums, I feel more could have been added. Proceed with caution.\n",
        "\nTo state one thing quite clear from the start: I admit that there is an Exodus fanboy in me. The day that I bought \"Bonded by Blood\" is his date of birth. He forces me to begin this review with the most positive detail of \"Blood In Blood Out\". Exodus deliver one song which can definitely compete with the classics of their early works. The outstanding \"Body Harvest\" can be considered as a valid argument for the immediate purchase of this full-length. It possesses everything that a thrash metal anthem needs. The strong verse coalesces into a highly dynamic bridge and the long drawn-out screams during the chorus are as fantastic as the flattening riffing after the well executed solo. An unexpected highlight, a masterpiece in every respect.\n\nHaving this in mind, the focus can be set on the songs in general. Exodus fire some unerring shots from the cannons of thrash metal. One can discover a lot of thoroughly designed tracks that do not lack of speed, pressure and musical violence. Apart from this, the band has recorded a few convincing mid-tempo tunes. They stand in the tradition of songs such as \"Toxic Waltz\" or the underrated \"Only Death Decides\". Just listen, for example, to \"My Last Nerve\". These tracks are much more than just a supplement. With one or two exceptions, the songs of \"Blood In Blood Out\" do not fail to hit the nail on the head. In general, the tunes demonstrate the strength of an experienced yet belligerent horde of thrash metal seniors that avoid successfully to get a midlife crisis. Despite of this, one thing is for sure. The magic of the group\u00b4s early days will never come back. But somebody else has returned. Of course, you know the man I am speaking about: Zetro Souza. To be quite honest, I am relieved.\n\n\"Rob Dukes\" - this is not only the name of the worst Exodus singer so far. It seems to be simultaneously the shortest definition for a guy you do not like without knowing him personally. Perhaps it is unfair, but he always appeared to me as the incarnation of unsocial behavior. However, the well-known voice of his successor (and predecessor) fits much better to the tracks of Exodus. Zetro always seems to be at risk to go mad within the next seconds. His hysteric screams, which are occasionally accompanied by some gang shouts, strengthen the effectiveness of the restless guitars that march forward without pausing to draw breath. Speaking of the guitars: on the one hand, the pulsating riffs know no mercy due to their prevailing high speed approach. On the other hand, it takes some time in order to distinguish them from each other. After all it is good to know that mastermind and main songwriter Gary Holt still keeps the strings together. He is the reason why Exodus still - or again - sound like Exodus. Even more, his way of playing the guitar gives rise to the question of whether it was really necessary to engage guest musicians, whatever they may be called. \n\nDue to a slight lack of catchiness, it takes several times to realize the amazing high quality of the full-length, inter alia its liveliness and its energizing effect. However, while other albums sometimes become quickly tedious, this one is getting more and more exciting. This gratifying process seems to be caused by the positive attitude of the band. The five bundles of energy apparently feel comfortable with their situation. In accordance with their expert status in terms of thrash metal, they just play the music they like to play without taking commercial aspects into closer consideration. The deal with the German industry giant Nuclear Blast seems to ensure the necessary quantum of artistic freedom. And what\u00b4s maybe more important, the production budget was evidently high enough to create a very powerful sound. For example, the bass guitar is omnipresent and adds value in a remarkable manner. The drums, skillfully handled by Tom Hunting, represent another excellent feature in view of their heaviness and variability. The modern guitar sound is flawless, except if you think that modernity in itself is a flaw. In such a case, you probably will blame the sound for being sterile and lifeless. \n\nAll in all, the US-Americans prove that the band does not belong to these kind of aging groups that have a glorious past, a mediocre present and definitely no future. It goes without saying that their groundbreaking debut will remain unsurpassed forever. But unlike its two predecessors, \"Blood In Blood Out\" adds another noteworthy item in the voluminous catalogue of Gary Holt\u00b4s thrash institution. Only the ugly cover sucks. Enough said. I have to listen to \"Body Harvest\" once again. Or, better still, to the entire album.\n",
        "\nThe Big 4 this, the Big 4 that, we've heard it all before. Some of us have also heard of the significance of one of the first Bay Area thrash metal bands, Exodus, which originally had Kirk Hammett as their lead guitar player. Unfortunately, he wouldn't be with the band long enough for him to be a part of their smashing debut, \"Bonded by Blood\", one of the finest thrash metal albums ever created that also set the standards for many thrash albums to come in the following decades.\n\nGary Holt and Rick Hunolt are very talented guitarists, but rather than create a complex musical masterpiece worthy of making the band the next Iron Maiden, they decided to cut some corners in order to make the songs more aggressive. That's just fine by me, 'cos when it comes to thrash metal, the more aggressive, the better. Much of their riffs are somewhat simple, consisting of chugging e-note rhythms and a few basic power chords. Those were all the band needed to put more of an intimidating and powerful sound. It is proof that you don't really need to be that intricate in order to please a crowd, sometimes a simple riff could be all that would be necessary to get a circle pit going. Unfortunately, this simple formula would be ripped of by band after band, wannabe after wannabe, in the years that followed, particularly in the 21st century, when retro-thrash bands became all the rage, no pun intended.\n\nExodus has more than their fair share of stellar material, but \"Bonded by Blood\" has to be my all-time favorite, particularly 'cos of the vocal performance of singer Paul Baloff. His voice features the gruff and aggressive growls that is common among thrash metal bands as well as some high-pitched barks and squeals that often go along with it. Those barks, squeals and growls give the voice more energy and make it more powerful and heavy. I think it fits the music better, rather than the gruff, nasally vocal delivery of Baloff's successor, Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, which can get a little annoying at times. Zetro's voice also doesn't have as much power as Baloff's does, as Zetro's sounds a little wimpy and whiny (not that he's a terrible vocalist, though, he does metal screams well). Baloff's voice conveys the rage and aggression of the music even further while Zetro's merely supplants the music itself. Even if the lyrics are a little uncreative and unintentionally hilarious at times, Baloff delivers them quite nicely.\n\nAlso a signature of thrash metal, and particularly of Exodus, is the fact that some of the music seems to display a sense of humor. \"No Love\" is a sort of bait-and-switch song in the sense that it tricks the uninitiated listener into believing that it's a sweet breakup song using a somewhat passionate-sounding song title and a light, acoustic guitar solo that sounds so pleasant and pristine. Then, after a minute, the song strikes at full force playing Exodus' signature thrash metal sound and occult-related lyrics, shocking the listener. In later years, their sense of humor would be more obvious, as they did a cover of the infamous War song \"Low Rider\" on their \"Fabulous Disaster\" album. That kind of humor would also be ripped off by many retro-thrash bands, leading a lot of people to criticize the genre as dishonest and silly. The subgenre was meant to convey a sense of anger towards the oppressing authority and only a slight touch of humor, but sometimes with many retro-thrash bands, that humor got quite out of hand. The band only used humor at most only once or twice throughout each of their albums, keeping their usage light, and the same could be said for this album.\n\nWhen the aggression of any of the Big 4 isn't enough to please you, \"Bonded by Blood\" should do the trick. The album is to thrash metal as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is to American literature, 'cos it's an unspoken rule that all thrashers should have this album in their collection along with any of the material released by the Big 4. It's an excellent example of Bay Area thrash that many \"pizza thrash\" bands would rip off in the new millennium, which is a shame, since now this brilliant sound is made cliche because of them. Nonetheless, it still stands as one of the greatest thrash albums ever created, if not the number one thrash metal album of all time.\n",
        "\nExodus are an odd creature among the old guard of thrash metal. Having barely avoided the dreaded scourge of the nineties by breaking up after 1992\u2019s Force of Habit (which was middling but not outright offensive), they reappeared in 2001 with the stellar comeback, Tempo of the Damned. That still didn\u2019t stop them from turning to shit though, for in 2007 they put out the aptly named The Atrocity Exhibit. (For the sake of the children I won\u2019t even begin to discuss the catastrophe that was Let There Be Blood...)\n\nPeople tend to cite the angsty metalcore shouts of Rob Dukes as the main reason for Exodus\u2018 downfall, but in all fairness, he was only mildly annoying at worst (quite decent at best), and he probably didn\u2019t contribute much to the actual songwriting. No, this atrophy of Exodus is best attributed to the replacement of founding guitarist Rick Hunolt with Lee Altus in 2005. Since then, the band has developed a strange obsession with writing drawn-out, seven-minute-ish songs. While one would naturally correlate such extended durations with \u2018progressive\u2019 song structures (it\u2019s kind of the norm for Altus in Heathen, after all), Exodus have no such alibi.\n\nThus, without anything remotely progressive about Exodus\u2018 music, it\u2019s strange how their songs inexplicably tend to end up twice as long as they need to be; five songs on The Atrocity Exhibit crossed the seven minute mark, and The Human Condition took it yet a step further, with another five, as well as three more that dangerously approached that mark. Blood In, Blood Out, then, seems like a step in the right direction, with none of its eleven tracks ever reaching that dreaded duration. And for a brief moment, it is. The hammering rage of \u201cBlack 13\u201d and the gang shouts of the title track cut to the chase, with absolutely no room for error, while the out of this world chorus of \u201cSalt the Wound\u201d reaffirms newly rejoined Zetro\u2019s position as the most pissed off vocalist in all of thrash. Most importantly, the sharp but lifeless sound the band possessed during the Dukes era has been scrapped in favour of a production that quite impressively replicates that of Tempo of the Damned (the only difference being the less overtly loud bass), inadvertently setting a very high bar for the rest of the album\u2026 But things only go downhill from here.\n\nFrom the lethargic chorus and insipid grooves of \u201cBody Harvest\u201d, to the irritating nu metal-ish break of \u201cMy Last Nerve\u201d, or the \u201cDeathamphetamine\u201d reboot that is \u201cFood for the Worms\u201d, the album is riff after riff of wearied, phoned in and disingenuous thrash that just pales in comparison to Tempo in every way imaginable. Their problem lies no longer in meandering song lengths, but in forgettable riffs and a thoroughly tepid delivery. Holt and Altus are way past their prime, and slapping on a couple of guest appearances isn\u2019t going to help their case. I mean does anyone really give a shit about Kirk Hammett\u2019s solo \u2013 the same half-assed wah-laden one he\u2019s been playing again and again for like twenty years now? Should anyone care that Chuck Billy roars for a minute? (Over the worst, most agonisingly repetitive riff on the entire album, at that.) I don\u2019t even know who Dan the Automator is, or what is it exactly that he does on \u201cBlack 13\u201d; it sounds like a perfectly normal Exodus track to me. I can only hope their next album doesn\u2019t feature an Eminem verse or like a David Vincent remix or something.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be hard to do worse than the turd that was Let There Be Blood, but aside from its first two tracks and \u201cSalt the Wound\u201d, Blood In, Blood Out is an album of little value. While Exodus might not be out of ideas just yet, the day is drawing near \u2013 the scourge of the nineties is back in full force to bite them in the ass, and it seems that not even Zetro can stop it.\n\n(Originally written for teethofthedivine.com)\n",
        "\nExodus have been a band that tried, stopped, tried again, tried again AND tried again. Their train derailed somewhere in the nineties at the same time pretty much all old school thrash metal bands were going through an identity crisis thanks to the downfall of eighties metal. Even though \u2018Force Of Habit\u2019 was by far better than the worst albums Testament, Sacred Reich, Anthrax, Metallica and Slayer were releasing during the mid-nineties, Exodus nevertheless died afterwards. \n\nTheir short lived glorious comeback with Baloff (and amazing live album) was continued with the return of Zetro for obvious reasons when they released \u2018Tempo of the Damned\u2019 which, retrospectively, hasn\u2019t stood the test of time that well really. The sound was too tight, sterile, lacked that old school sweaty real life feeling and also lacked a high necessary amount of fast songs which made the band great in the first place. On 'Tempo of the Damned' Exodus just became another \u2018pissed off\u2019 sounding band. A somewhat one-dimensional experience.\n\nThen they took a nosedive. 'Exhibit A' and 'Let There Be Blood' were such over-digital lifeless albums with terrible, godawful vocals on which Exodus sounded so far away from the glorious band that once released the timeless classics Fabulous Disaster and Bonded By Blood. A lot of older fans simply stopped caring and going to their gigs because their vocalist at the time, Dukes, didn\u2019t do their old songs any justice and made the entire band sound like just another metalcore band, his stage presence didn\u2019t do the band any good either. Slowly the band began regaining consciousness and \u2018Exhibit B\u2019 has a few moments of clarity or even brilliance, if you wished away those vocals. As said in my earlier review of that album, the 78:28 minute \u2018Exhibit B\u2019 featured enough great riffs and ideas to have led to a great 40 minute Exodus album and also IF it had had another vocalist. \n\nFast forward to 2014: singer Zetro is back. Was this enough for Exodus to come up with a mindblowing new album? No, the \u2018decent\u2019 and therefor rather disappointing \u2018Tempo\u2019 album had proved that earlier in their career. Exodus need an album with good vocals, good riffs AND a majority of fast songs. Exodus is a band that stood for energy! So start raging. This ain\u2019t the Arsenio Hall show, destroy something! In 2014 they finally did. \u2018Blood In Blood Out\u2019 is pretty much their best studio album since 1990\u2019s \u2018Impact Is Imminent\u2019 or at least the first album (with new material) since then that actually sounds like Exodus from the eighties again. If you want typical catchy eighties feeling: the title track is right there for you. It\u2019s 1987 all over again. A to-the-point thrash metal song, shorter than 4 minutes, high average pace, solid furious riffing and a chorus which is classic shout-a-long material. \n\nSpeaking of catchy lyrics, this was something Exodus were excellent at during their first few albums. Those elaborate omnipresent backing vocals and lead vocal lines which could almost be considered rhymes in a traditional sense and brought with a highly accurate rhythm by Zetro. This is what makes songs like \u2018Collateral Damage\u2019 and \u2018Body Harvest\u2019 the next in line of instant Exodus classics. Not only vocally the songs are way up there with some of their classics but their riffs and song structures as well. A fast pace exactly when a song needs it and catchiness in riffs & breaks put in at the right moment resulting in pristine effective thrashers. Thrash needs good hooks and these songs bring you exactly that. \n\nIs this such a great flawless album then? Will this be remembered just as their first 3 or 4 albums? Probably not. It\u2019s all retro now. It's delivered in a time when this stuff has become \u2018just another release in one of hundred subgenres in metal\u2019 and those typical Exodus elements which were once new, refreshing and energizing a whole generation of young metal fans are now considered by many to be cheesy, clich\u00e9 or plain dull and old fashioned. Also, apart from the somewhat decent \u2018Salt the Wound\u2019 which is on par with the material on their \u2018Tempo\u2019 album, we have two slower and unfortunately duller songs. \u2018BTK\u2019 and \u2018My Last Nerve\u2019 are two meandering songs which will maybe appeal to those fans that could stomach their Exhibit A days though not me. \n\nFortunately faster and more old school orientated songs like \u2018Wrapped in the Arms of Rage\u2019 and \u2018Numb\u2019 make it all right again. One could complain the songs are a bit overlong but so far I actually don\u2019t have much trouble with their length. Exodus pull off the lengthy songs here much better than Metallica on Death Magnetic. Also, I should not forget to mention closing song \u2018Food for the Worms\u2019. This song has by far the fastest moments on the album and actually the fastest moment in Exodus history. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Gary Holt someday will admit the song uses some ideas and riffs which he wrote with Slayer in mind\u2026\n\nAll-in all, \u2018Blood In Blood Out\u2019 is an Exodus album on which they go back in time. For some this\u2019ll be a disappointment, for fans of old like me this is a pure case of welcoming back an old friend. The days have passed but apparently there are new stories to be told as well. Here\u2019s to a bright new future with friends of old. Which in my book is the best thing 2014 could have given me.\n",
        "\nSo what we have here is album number ten from the legendary Bay Area thrashers Exodus. And without beating around the bush let me just say that YES, I am very happy to have Zetro back! This is the way Exodus should sound.\n\nWhile Rob Dukes was alright, he wasn\u2019t anything special, and in my opinion never really fit in with the Exodus sound. He was too much of a screamer, and not enough of a singer. He didn't have the soul of Exodus and just generally came off as a too aggressive shouter, which just doesn't work with their sound. You don\u2019t need false \u201ctough guy\u201d vocals to sound aggressive, which Zetro happily proves on this album.\n\nSo album number ten, huh? I think it\u2019s pretty safe to say that most of us were underwhelmed with the past few Exodus releases. While some good tracks were sprinkled here and there (Funeral Hymn is still amazing) overall it felt like filler. So what we have here is more old school Exodus, which is not a bad thing. Because when Exodus get it right, they really get it right. So lets see what they've come up with in this new installment of Bay Area thrash.\n\nBlack 13 is what I would call a mediocre intro to an album. Though it gives us many clues of what\u2019s to come \u2013 a nice, thick guitar sound, rumbling bass, and Tom Hunting\u2019s trademark thrash beats, which sound nice and punchy and clear. The song itself is nothing to write home about, though. I just expected better. Thankfully, the next track \u201cBlood In, Blood Out\u201d delivers on all levels. Classic Exodus from start to finish, this is what I wanted to hear. Exactly what I wanted to hear in fact. Fast, brutal, catchy \u2013 it pretty much has it all.\n\nEasily one of the highlights on the album has got to be \u201cSalt the Wound\u201d, which features Kirk Hammett. I personally thought this was a pretty cool thing to do, as Kirk was a founding member of Exodus. So for him to return to the band and deliver a guitar solo was a nice touch. People saying that it was just done for a marketing gimmick.. well, you may be right. But it didn't bother me at all because the guy has every right to be there. That said though, this is easily one of the best songs on the album. The riffs are just pure, no nonsense thrash, with a fair amount of groove thrown in. Tom\u2019s drumming just seems to make the song, as the bridge leading up to the guitar leads just wouldn't work without that double bass groove. Kirk\u2019s performance here is good, though obviously it\u2019s nothing ground breaking or earth shattering. He pretty much came in and did what he did back in the day when he was allowed to do the same in Metallica. And come on, that\u2019s not a bad thing. The song on a whole however gets full points from me, it\u2019s just pretty badass.\n\nBTK is another track which features a guest performance, and this time it\u2019s Chuck from Testament. Sadly, the song does pretty much nothing for me. To be honest, most of the rest of the album doesn't do much for me. There are some good tracks sprinkled here and there such as \u201cBody Harvest\u201d, \u201cFood For the Worms\u201d and maybe \u201cHonor Killings\u201d\n\nOne thing about this album, and with new Exodus in general, is that the songs are just too damn long. An Exodus song should never pass the five minute mark. After that you\u2019re pushing it, and there are six songs here which are over six minutes long \u2013 and that\u2019s more than half the album. Cut it out. Exodus songs should be short, to the point, and aggressive. Around four minutes in length is perfect for them, and it seems that anything after that just turns into a chore.\n\nOverall, I both like and dislike this album. The positives are that it sounds great and that Zetro is back. The negatives are that it\u2019s simply just not interesting enough. I was expecting more this time around, especially since the last two albums didn't go over so well. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s still fun to listen to from time to time, but strangely most of it just goes in one ear and out the other. There\u2019s nothing really to cling onto.. and the songs are just so goddamn long.\n",
        "\nIt's always a momentous occasion when such a revered name in the thrash scene, the mighty Exodus, have yet another collection of ripping assaults to unleash upon the world. Gary Holt and co. haven't been the most harmonious of bands in recent months, with the totally unexpected firing of previous throat-destroyer Rob Dukes. But the quality of their output over the past decade has never dipped (yes, I love groove metal, and \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" was brilliant. Shut your fucking mouths.) - setting up the anticipation for Zetro's 2014 comeback to be as pleasantly received as \"Tempo of the Damned\".\n\n\"Blood In Blood Out\", as a title, may sound a little odd. But replace the first 'Blood' with 'Steve Zetro Souza' and the second 'Blood' with 'Rob Dukes' and BOOM! Conspiracy theory ahoy! The cover art is simply brilliant; a typically nightmarish dystopian zombie scene that would make Ed Repka proud. If you acquire the digipak, as I have, you'll also receive some additional shiny artwork and a wonderfully detailed DVD on the making of the album. So as a package, this one presents itself very well indeed!\n\n2004's \"Tempo of the Damned\" was a compact and concise little beast when compared to the sprawling lengthy structures of \"The Atrocity Exhibition\". But \"Blood In Blood Out\" has meshed those two characteristic together - creating an odd mixture of songs which could easily be 4-minutes each, but are somehow stretched beyond 6 minutes. The whole affair certainly feels too long - but Exodus have gone for quality and quantity; something incredibly difficult to achieve within the confines of thrash metal.\n\nThe production is pretty excellent (Andy Sneap, dur!). I won't say it retains that 'old school' feel - because it doesn't. This is vicious, frenetic thrash done 21st century style. A wonderfully metallic bass rumbles underneath a gritty guitar-tone whilst Tom Hunting's drums bash away like fucking hammers behind it all. Sprinkled on top, for good measure, are Holt's maddest solos yet - and some excellent gang-shouts in many of the choruses, which actually does retain that 'old school' feel! Zetro's vocals steal the show completely - sounding as sneery as ever, and sometimes verging on completely deranged! Just listen to the chorus of \"Salt The Wound\" - he almost manages to sound like Bobby Blitz!\n\nVery few tracks feel like 'throwaways', with most of them containing sections which feel completely removed from the original themes. \"Body Harvest\", \"Numb\", \"Wrapped In The Arms of Rage\" and the fire-like opener \"Black 13\" all have those mid-paced groove sections I look forward to so much in Exodus albums. \"BTK\" is a definitely highlight; another explicit attack on religion with a killer groove and a truly colossal outro! The frenzied title-track will have loyal thrashers everywhere wrecking necks and smashing skulls. And the previously mentioned \"Salt The Wound\" is truly seething, with a guest appearance from none other than Kirk Hammett!\n\nNot everything is perfect; the whole release is fairly lengthy and difficult to concentrate on in one sitting. Also, \"My Last Nerve\" is a tad forgettable. But the sheer amount of thrash riffage, heavy grooves and blistering solos should keep the majority of naysayers quiet for the time being. I may hate the way Exodus treated the fantastic Rob Dukes, but they made up for it by releasing the thrash album of the year so far!\n\n\"When I think of all the hell you tried to put me through,\nIt can't compare to what's already done.\nIt's time to say farewell and leave you black and blue,\nWhen I rip you open, all I'll do...\nIs salt the wound!!\"\n",
        "\nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve really grown into the thrash metal scene and adore several records by the Big 4 Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica and Slayer, the Teutonic three with Destruction, Kreator and Tankard and other honorable mentions such as New Jersey legends Overkill, Bay Area legends Death Angel, the more progressive Quebeckers from Voivod and their modern incarnations called Vektor and even more obscure bands like the Japanese Gargoyle and Sex Machineguns for example. I even got to like some hardcore influenced thrash metal from Stormtroopers of Death up to A\u00e7\u00e3o Libert\u00e1ria. Exodus is not only one of the latest bands I\u2019ve discovered in that genre but overall one of those few thrash metal bands I didn\u2019t get into yet even though some fans keep on saying that \u201cBonded by Blood\u201d is one of, if not the best thrash metal release ever and that this band should have made it into the Big 4 instead of Anthrax.\n\nFrom my point of view, Exodus features exchangeable, fast and brutal riffs, an unstable bass guitar work that has some shining moments while it\u2019s completely inaudible in other tracks and a technically decent drumming. All these elements sound close to some early Overkill and maybe Kreator tracks without reaching the quality of these two bands. The worst thing about this new record is the vocals. It sounds like an odd mixture of an angry Donald Duck and Overkill\u2019s Bobby \u201cBlitz\u201d Ellsworth but Steve \u201cZetro\u201d Souza\u2019s bickered and monotonous barking has no recognition value whatsoever to me.\n\nThe record starts with an overlong and plodding intro and evolves into a completely exchangeable ten-minute long thrash metal song with an average rhythm section, worn-out riffs and monotonous lead vocals supported by occasional gang shouts and a guest singer nobody has ever heard about and who feels like he wasn\u2019t even there at all\u2026 oh, wait, it\u2019s not a ten-minute long track, these are actually two songs! Well, they sound so alike and unspectacular that I didn\u2019t realize that they were actually separated at some point in the first place. By the way, this element is somehow the guiding line of the record because it won\u2019t get any better.\n\n\u201cSalt the Wounds\u201d got some attention prior to the release of this album because it features a guest appearance of Metallica guitarist and ex-Exodus member Kirk Hammett. Nobody openly admits to care about or even like Metallica anymore but people obviously secretly do. That\u2019s a clever strategy to push this release a little bit as the last few Exodus releases didn\u2019t sell quite well and got underwhelming reviews. It\u2019s no surprise though that this song can\u2019t fulfill its expectations and is even among the weaker tracks on here. The somewhat tinny drum sound and the boring riffs that don\u2019t fit at all to the vocal performance are a big letdown. Kirk Hammett\u2019s predictable wah-wah-solo makes me wonder if he can still play any solo without using that pedal over and over again. The lyrics feel like a laughable Cannibal Corpse rip-off and don\u2019t make things any better. Instead of being one of the few highlights, that is even one of the weakest songs on here.\n\n\u201cBody Harvest\u201d actually has a simple yet energizing chorus and a brutal lead riff that shakes things up but instead of delivering three minutes of energizing punk-driven thrash metal, Exodus stretches the song to six minutes and a half and includes a completely unspectacular instrumental section that ruins an otherwise tolerable song. It seems to be a laughable current trend for grown-old thrash metal bands to stretch their songs to unbearable lengths without any reason. One can find several similar examples on Blood In Blood Out as well.\n\nExodus invited a third guest singer in form of Testament\u2019s Chuck Billy to get even more recognition. Testament surely is slightly more interesting than Exodus but the vocals simply don\u2019t differ enough to build up an intriguing contrast to the main singer on this unimpressive seven-minute long piece of boredom. By the way, another song about \u201cBTK\u201d is far from being original. Please listen to Church of Misery\u2019s atmospheric and gripping instrumental song of the same name instead.\n\nIs there actually any at least bearable track on this coaster or frisbee, depending on which version you prefer? Well, there is. \u201cMy Last Nerve\u201d has a few interesting guitar melodies leading to a chorus that differs from the others. The song manages to develop a certain atmosphere and is also technically stunning. There is a short break dominated by the vivid use of the bass guitar which is a welcome change of style where Jack Gibson can finally show off his talent.\n\nOne decent song out of eleven or twelve is definitely not enough. Exodus released not only another weak record but even one of the most uninspired genre albums I have ever listened to. It was a true pain to sit through the entire record. Do yourself a favour and ignore the clever marketing strategy based around the guest appearances by Kirk Hammett and Chuck Billy. Let Exodus be that overlooked underground band that only a few grown old genre maniacs appreciate for nostalgic reasons. There are way better old and new American thrash metal bands around that are worth your attention.\n",
        "\nTo be frank, the disposal of retroactive fall guy Rob Dukes followed by the long-pined for riposte of Souza didn't elicit the expected unanimous fanfare, at least not courtesy of my point of view. With Zetro stacking bodies via his Hatriot project earlier this year with Dawn of the Centurion, bolstered by his hungry cadre of up-and-comers, the daydream-amplified brilliance of a reunion with Holt simply lacked the gleaming allure it once had, so much so that the eventual news of the reconciliation fell quite flat, since much of this was a given once Dukes was out anyway.\n\nThat said, while the taste of cold steel had faded with memory in the decade since such was administered via Tempo of the Damned, the exact same interim had elicited some favors toward the last time we saw this particular lineup (sans Hunolt) active. Tracks like \"Impaler,\" \"Shroud of Urine\" and even a share of the more knockabout, bruising offerings like \"Sealed With a Fist\" remained fresh in my memory, and I would be lying if I cited a lack of anticipation here. In fact, I find no qualms in anointing upon Blood In Blood Out the title of Tempo of the Damned 2.0. Save for the ejection of some of the more plodding, excessively jouncy pit-churners like \"Throwing Down\" and \"Blacklist,\" those seeking the familiar will find a sizable aggregate of typical Exodus brickwork within. Not content to rest on their laurels, Exodus have reached back a fair bit into their catalogue here on the hunt for valid inspiration, and this abstraction is sealed in poser blood on the smashing title track, which tries so shamelessly to evoke spectres of waltzers long passed it actually succeeds! A total throwback to the lighthearted romp that was Fabulous Disaster, and a highlight no matter how you slice it.\n\nOne of the major complaints leveled against the Dukes material was the pretentious songwriting scope without the general presence of chops to fill the void on the other end. This brought us much of the plodding, excessive trash that made Exhibit B one of the biggest disappointments of that year. Save for \"Funeral Hymn\" and sections of \"Deathamphetamine,\" the band was better off lapping the more lugubrious outings en route to a more concise bloodletting. This is all true, but credit where it is due, Blood In Blood Out feels short and concise despite featuring only three songs under five minutes in length. A comprehensive adherence to higher tempos and more sustained velocity (save for the moodier \"My Last Nerve\") helps the band get away with much of this here, and Holt's characteristic riffs take on something of a throwback disposition when sped up from the plodding doldrums they have been entrenched in for much of the past decade. \n\nIntrigue is precipitated mightily on the opener \"Black 13,\" which features a gurgling electronic undertone that is clearly trying to recapture some of the glories of the early '90s, a time so surreal that acts like Anthrax could collaborate with hip-hop artists. The kill machine quickly settles into well-worn grooves however, and I don't anticipate many thrashers to be ailing after Blood In Blood Out wraps up. In fact, the biggest deficiencies present here are actually due to ancillary comparisons that I have no choice but to make. Most of this revolves around Zetro, who despite sounding very much like the petulant imp we remember him as, pales in direct contrast to his Hatriot output. \"Superkillafragsadisticactsaresoatrocious,\" anyone? Not only that, but he somehow concurrently avoids sounding like someone shat in his breakfast cereal like on \"War Is My Shepherd.\" The flagrant use of gang shouts generally sounds fresh here, but even this gets to be a bit much, especially on numbers like \"Collateral Damage.\" Through all of this, a clear case can be made against the record, insofar that it overcompensates slightly. \n\nThese complaints aside, Blood in Blood Out does just about all of what it sets out to, and that is to remind us that Exodus still maintains some spark of the vitriol that made them such an animated, entertaining but at the same time more extreme alternative to some of the more mainstream thrashers of the classic era. These guys already reminded us of this fact once before, but I through their own transgressions needed to do the necessary legwork and bring us all back to square one, which this record honorably does most of the time. Holt's exaggerated tone is cleaned up a fair bit, and as such this doesn't sound quite as sterile and modern as Exhibit A and Shovel Headed Kill Machine, but the bottom line is that fans of any permutation of Exodus will get their rocks off to much of Blood In Blood Out. I'll still take Overkill's White Devil Armory over this, but it is nice to have these guys back all the same.\n",
        "\nDuring the period between their legendary debut and this album, Exodus had undergone a clear change. The very homogenous songwriting formula of the first full-length had turned to a new approach which was a bit more diversified. The lyrics of \"Pleasures of the Flesh\" covered a wider range of topics and did not only deal with brutality and violence as an end in itself. The unusual cover motif was more or less socially acceptable and, last but not least, Zetro Souza showed up as the new lead vocalist after the departure of Paul Baloff.\n\nZetro performed in a convincing way. He picked up the vibration of each and every song while resisting the temptation to copy the vocal style that Paul Baloff had chosen on \"Bonded by Blood\". The unchanged instrumental section worked in a technically flawless manner. Anything else would have been a great surprise after their mature performance on the debut. Overall, the band played tight while presenting the coherent song material. The tracks themselves showed a multifaceted picture and they benefitted from a clear and powerful production.\n\n\"Bonded by Blood\" had offered some slower parts, but its successor revealed tunes that flew completely at a leisurely pace. This loss of speed did not go hand in hand with a lack of quality. Mid-tempo tunes such as \"\u00b4Til Death Do Us Part\" or \"Braindead\" left a lot of space for the guitars to create an intense atmosphere. Due to its powerful guitar lines, the ending of the first-mentioned song was the most clear-cut example. Furthermore, these two songs profitted from the excellent riffs that pointed them in the right direction. By the way, it goes without saying that the album included a large number of captivating riffs. They sounded edgy (for example, listen to \"Parasite\") and marked definitely the trademark of the band\u00b4s sound. In my humble opinion, the majority of the riffs would still be predestined to teach children the splendour of thrash metal. It is just a pity that I do not know a school where thrash metal is taught. Clearly, this state of affairs needs changing.\n\nThe versatile album presented a lot of highlights. The epic yet aggressive title track with its original jungle intro dominated the B side, but the menacing \"Chemi-Kill\" was certainly no less exciting due to its bulky riffing and the sociocritical lyrics. Please pay attention to the fine difference, a song about industrial pollution would have been unimaginable on their debut. The A side was almost flawless, only its final track did not meet the highest demands. Incidentally, the same went for the last tune of the B side. But do not get me wrong, each and every song made a - larger or smaller - positive contribution to the final result. The only exception was a short piece that featured just acoustic guitars. But this tune did not bother me due to its brevity. \n\nExodus had to deliver a worthy successor for their groundbreaking debut and they mastered the task almost perfectly. They knew that they were at risk to release a lukewarm second part of the debut if they did not find a new musical direction. It was therefore a wise decision to change their compositional approach according to the motto \"as much as necessary, as little as possible\". Of course, \"Bonded by Blood\" remained their masterpiece. But \"Pleasures of the Flesh\" became a serious competitor. Honestly, I fear that Exodus will never again achieve this level of musical brilliance. Too many attempts have failed.\n",
        "\nTempo of the Damned can be compellingly deceptive on first blush, as it's tracks embody two fairly disparate styles divided by some sort of stylistic cut-off point located around the center of the album. Everything from \"Scar Spangled Banner\" to \"Shroud of Urine\" is unabashedly high-tempo thrash, save for a few obligatory lulls during the chorus of \"Blacklist\". The rest of the album (save for \"Impaler\", which we'll get to later) are all in the mid-paced, churning fisticuff style that Exodus seems to have become quite fond of lately.\n\nA great vocalist can really be the deciding factor during the slower, more groove-infected numbers, and Souza is thankfully still up to the task. His impish inflection is absolutely all over tracks like \"Sealed with a Fist\", helping keep the whole ordeal's head above water when the slicing edge of Holt's riffs begins to dull. Others like \"Culling the Herd\" and \"Throwing Down\" don't fare quite so well, but are still far superior to most of the similar numbers fronted by Dukes. Souza's voice has actually improved with age, with an extra layer of grit accumulated on top of his normal nasal intonation. He reaches some harpy-like highs and even interjects some lower roars into certain parts of \"War Is My Shepherd\".\n\nHolt's percussive riffing style is still here in spades, but Sneap's production has always rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it is because I jumped from Shovel Headed Kill Machine right into this, but the guitars aren't as prominent as I would like. The tone still has that grimy Exodus crunch to it, but other than occasionally perking up during some of the lead sections, the guitars fall a bit flat. It doesn't help that a lot of Tempo of the Damned's appeal is hinged on Holt's riffs, riffs that show potential but are a bit let down by the mix. The one natural exception to this paradigm is \"Impaler\", which is infamous for being a Bonded by Blood castoff that was thankfully never forgotten and put to effective use here. It has an archaic appeal and stands out like a sore thumb in the procession, being bookended by two of the more grooving numbers. I'm aware that Hunolt is here to reunite the \"H-Team\", but if you are familiar with his state of mind at this point in time along with his impending departure, it is unlikely that he contributed much of the songwriting.\n\nThe silky smooth production does Hunting great favors on the kit, not that he needs much help in delivering a rock-solid percussive backbone. He has a fairly distinctive style that was sorely missed on Shovel Headed Kill Machine, and I swear that nobody can do the quick triplet double-bass fills as accurately as him. I wish Gibson was more prominent, though. His clangy tone added a great underproduced appeal to some of the later albums - an appeal that naturally can't coexist with Sneap - so off to the void his bass goes.\n\nI don't want to be misconstrued, Tempo of the Damned is still as good of as a comeback album as can be expected considering the whirlwind of chaos most of the members went through during most of the decade prior to it's inception. In fact, during certain passages I almost need to check and make sure I'm not actually listening to Impact is Imminent, which this can easily go toe-to-toe with at it's best. \"Sealed with a Fist\" is a real knockabout bruiser, but the rest of the slower cuts are decidedly hit or miss. It's a shame that Souza departed shortly after the tour commenced, because Exodus hadn't lost a step as a cohesive unit here despite my minor quibbles with the production and mid-paced numbers. I have to nitpick, it's what I do.\n",
        "\nWhile Tempo of the Damned embodied a more than passable comeback attempt on the Californians' part, Souza soon departed yet again, forcing Exodus to seek out a new vocalist for the first time in nearly twenty years. In an atypical decision, Holt's crew decided to recruit a modern shrieker in Rob Dukes and play up the abrasive, modern thrash angle that was somewhat-hinted at on Tempo of the Damned.\n\nShovel Headed Kill Machine certainly has no issues with its modern aesthetics, featuring a hollow and mechanical sheen to the guitars' tone that summons mental images of relentless machinery gone wild. The approach is eerily similar to that on Overkill's ReliXIV, evoking similar underproduced swells of distortion along with incendiary, bold chords. The tone is so abrasive and caustic that it loses some of its control over the lower-end of the mix. This is where Gibson's bass steps up and plugs the sonic holes with its crunchy, overdriven, and clangy timbre. This stylistic approach is most evident in the beginning of \"Deathamphetamine\", during which the tinny bass notes give way to bulky surges of Holt's beyond-overdriven tone. The rocking, groovy disposition of \"Shudder to Think\" hails back to some of the more mid-paced numbers from Tempo of the Damned, embodying perhaps the highest proclivity of modern influence and clarifying the direction the band was aiming for going forward.\n\nMost of Shovel Headed Kill Machine rumbles by at a decent-enough tempo, even if it fails to challenge even its direct predecessor in terms of churning velocity. This more calculated compositional style gives a knuckle-cracking appeal to behemoths like \"Going Going Gone\" and \"Altered Boy\", the latter of which sounds exactly like Overkill's \"Black Daze\". \"Going Going Gone\" is still my favorite, featuring a mid-paced upsurge after a spastic false start. Even Dukes sounds decent here, with some more inventive lyrics and wordplay that help me put Souza's departure behind me. While Dukes is still clearly the weak link here, he lacks the upfront and irritating appeal present on albums like Exhibit B: The Human Condition.\n\nOther sections of the album are a little harder to keep around, like the Dukes-driven dropout verses of \"Raze\" and the overall mediocre \"Karma's Messenger\". Shovel Headed Kill Machine also hints at Exodus' future preference for overlong compositions, mainly due to the excessively-protracted nature of \"Deathamphetamine\". It should be a credit to the band that they manage to keep this one interesting for its entire duration, but it could still use some fat trimmed off to streamline its combustible appeal. Nothing here is downright offensive, which is something I couldn't even say for Tempo of the Damned, so it at least has that much going for it. I can go either way regarding Bostaph's performance here, though. He throws a number of interesting and atypical percussive patterns into the mixing pot, but the final outcome fails to make much of its desired impact due to the plastic-sounding nature of the kit. Hunting is a much more creative and better fit for Exodus, and his absence here leaves a gaping wound that never fully cauterizes no matter how fiery the proceedings get.\n\nShovel Headed Kill Machine has the tendency to sound somewhat samey after a while, but this is in hindsight the best we can probably expect from the Dukes lineup. The compositions are decent enough, and Exodus naturally tramples any semblance of restraint under their collective tank treads. Its got it where it counts.\n",
        "\nThis is superior to it's companion piece Exhibit B: The Human Condition for a number of reasons. Without question, The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A's riffs have more of a fire lit under their collective ass, driving many of these tracks forward with a grotesque, stomping persona that grooves nearly as much as it thrashes. Holt and Altus deliver their discharges of landscape-razing distortion via a chunky, modern tone that features eardrum-rupturing ardor as it snatches the reins away from Gibson's vehement bass, which was the standout on the previous release.\n\nThe album still reeks of the blowhard, protracted songwriting style that has dogged most modern Exodus releases. It isn't quite as melodramatic and overlong as it's direct successor, but The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A could still stand to lose some of it's excess baggage. The pointless twelve minutes of silence that conclude \"Bedlam 1-2-3\" reeks of an attempt at injecting subtle humor into an otherwise dead serious collection of songs. Dukes delivers his paranoid rants via his usual coarse bark, but his approach is slightly more varied than on Shovel Headed Kill Machine and Exhibit B: The Human Condition for some reason. There are sporadic clean vocal passages during \"Children of a Worthless God\", which shows that he is at least trying to shuffle his vocal cards a bit. Regardless, the anti-war, anti-Muslim blabbering present here is extremely dated, even by the time of this album's release. \n\nExodus made an earnest effort at rebranding themselves as a serious modern thrash act after years of doing The Toxic Waltz, but few were sold on the idea without a Baloff or Souza delivering the lyrical venom required to pull off such a coup. The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A hasn't forsaken the almighty melody in an effort to make the scene, so there are still some catchy scorchers like \"Funeral Hymn\" and \"Riot Act\", both of which are standouts due to their focused delivery and killer instinct. Others like the overlong quasi-title track \"The Atrocity Exhibition\" almost seem to make a concerted effort at sounding as dissonant and mechanical as possible, ultimately going in one ear and out the other. Hunting holds a lot of the more meandering songs together, acrobatically bobbing and weaving through a number of thrash beats and faster, more modern percussive styles. To compare this material to Exodus' close East Coast brother Overkill, many of these songs wouldn't sound too out of place on Bloodletting or perhaps ReliXIV, both of which are still far superior at the end of the day due to a timeless frontman in Ellsworth.\n\nThis is where The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A finds itself fatally flawed, as Dukes is just not capable of spitting the torrents of syllables required to evoke the off-the-wall atmosphere so critical to the thrash formula. His gruff snarls aren't terribly offensive on their own, but I find his lyrics way more counterproductive towards Exodus' attempts at earning serious modern credibility. The band's inactivity throughout most of the '90s would seem to be an advantage toward avoiding much of that decade's \"baggage\" that brought down other popular acts like Anthrax, but Exodus almost seem to be going through the throes of their experimental phase a decade later than they should have.\n\nThe Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A is far superior to it's direct successor and stylistic twin, so it at least has that to hang it's hat on. The album is undoubtedly frontloaded, with nearly all of the better cuts present during the first half. Ignore the protracted bores that pockmark the second half of the album and you might find something of value in it's haughty confines. Not a complete waste.\n",
        "\nI find myself appalled by the mere fact that modern Exodus has such a sizable following. What, honestly, has the band done since Tempo of the Damned? Shovel Headed Kill Machine is an annoyingly overproduced showcase of Holt's (admittedly rock-solid) modern riff theatrics surrounded by a skeleton crew of a band that might as well exist as programmed Guitar Pro tracks. The sad thing is that the band's 2005 effort continues to grow in appeal as Exodus feels the need to release pretentious odes to misdirection such as Exhibit B: The Human Condition, finding new and more distressing ways to defecate on their legacy.\n\nOn a strictly musical level, Exodus never embodied anything more than a generic, slightly heavier exhibition of West Coast thrash aesthetics. The band's wise and timely procurement of charismatic frontmen like Baloff and Souza became their true appeal, if only due to a lack of convincing performances elsewhere. So it should come as no surprise that the stigmatized presence of Dukes on this album immediately throws a number of red flags that should send most with reasonable taste running right off the bat. The indifference of his approach immediately puts an astronomical amount of pressure on the guitars to deliver the goods. Holt's characteristic, mid-paced patterns of dissonant crunch have a fairly potent disposition, but can't hope to carry Exhibit B: The Human Condition all on their own. Their tone is similar to the boomy sonic palette present on Shovel Headed Kill Machine, but the guitars are slightly less prominent in the mix. This approach yields decent returns during some of Holt's more measured riffing passages, but I can't help but feel that these guitars would sound more at home on a modern death metal album as opposed to a freakin' Exodus release. \n\nThe album immediately crumbles under the weight of it's own pretension as all but three of it's songs are at least twice as long as they need to be. Exodus needs to realize that epic qualities embody more than just protracted song length, usually manifesting themselves as more subdued hints and traces at honed excess. It should come as no shock that the more succinct numbers like \"Hammer and Life\" and \"Burn, Hollywood, Burn\" are two of the very few highlights present here. \"The Sun Is My Destroyer\" is also passable even if criminally overlong. The held-out, destructive open notes remind me of the chorus of \"Deathamphetamine\", one of the more structured cookers from Shovel Headed Kill Machine. Most of the material here actually features promising isolated moments that are repeatedly kneecapped by either pedestrian compositions, Dukes insipid ranting, or both. The closer \"Good Riddance\" suffers in this regard, featuring the most spirited tempo that embodies the most earnest individual attempt at breaking out of the mid-paced doldrums. Dukes manages to seal it's fate as yet another misdirected outpouring of angst, which ends up clashing stylistically with the esoteric keyboards and acoustic textures that fade out as the album finally ends.\n\nThe band attempts to tackle a number of interesting topics like atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial Army during the Sino-Japanese War of the late-'30s along with more recent school massacres. Sadly, nothing can make much of it's desired cerebral impact once transposed through Dukes' lame intonation. The lyrics are delivered in such a generic, angsty, and stereotypically abrasive way that they completely neuter themselves before anything has a chance to stick.\n\nExhibit B: The Human Condition's mighty flaws overshadow Hunting's continued dominance on the kit, which becomes something of an afterthought even if he is defying age and improving from album to album. He rivals Lipnicki from Overkill in both creativity and pure reckless abandon when it comes to the basic thrash patterns. The lightning fast dribbling of the double-bass on \"Good Riddance\" forces the rest of the band to keep up while subsequently delivering the most vigorous cut here. Gibson's overdriven bass is prominent, making it's biggest impact during the intro of \"A Perpetual State of Indifference\". It gets washed over in the mix once the rest of the band slides into their respective comfort zones, but it remains a solid compositional decision on Exodus' part that they should continue to experiment with.\n\nThe lack of melodic appeal serves as the final nail in Exhibit B: The Human Condition's coffin, the blow of the final hammer strike initializing it's descent into a hell reserved for only the most offensive of albums. The amount of talent being squandered here is almost unprecedented, as Exodus' modern lineup should have no problems delivering modern odes to a throwback state of mind that appears to be too elusive to recapture with Dukes at the helm. It doesn't have to end like this, hopefully Holt can find a more suitable voice to coexist with his unique playing style. Dukes just has to go, period.\n",
        "\nExodus altered their sound in the early 90s with Force of Habit, focusing on slower songs with downtuned guitars and a number of experimental elements. However, following the album's release, Exodus were unwilling to compromise their sound anymore for the changing music trends - and broke up. And since then, Gary Holt has expressed a hint of regret in having done this album, which is quite a shame, because it's definitely not a bad album. Different, but not bad. It's actually quite ambitious at times - there is much to be discovered within this 68-minute, 13-track album.\n\nMany of the song titles are existing figures of speech, although it's not clear whether it is coincidental or if the band intended to use them for most of the titles. The lyrical themes of the album vary, such as a love of thieving on the title track, and an anti-suicide message in the slow, almost-grungy \"Good Day to Die\". The album also contains two unlikely covers in \"Bitch\" originally by the Rolling Stones, and \"Pump it Up\", originally by Elvis Costello, and they actually work pretty well, all things considered. \n\nAlso, the album differs to previous Exodus releases in the way that the instruments are played and how they stand out. The bass guitar, in particular, has much more of a chance to stand out on its own on several occasions than on previous Exodus albums, though this may just be because they replaced their old bassist Rob McKillop with Michael Butler before work on the album began, and their playing styles just differ. There is also a heavier use of acoustic guitars, such as on the end of the otherwise heavy \"Count Your Blessings\", \"Good Day to Die\" and also the 11-minute slow moving and haunting epic \"Architect of Pain\", which is amongst the album's standout tracks. The drumming style throughout the album feels consistently thrash-oriented despite the multiple shifts in musical style that are included.\n\nI do feel that the album's production could have been somewhat better. The songs all sound fairly muddy and flat in the mix to me, which may have been okay for a more traditional Exodus album, but not so good for an album that tries to shift away from thrash and incorporate a variety of elements. It is worth noting that Force of Habit was released on a major label, and the band were probably feeling pressured into changing their sound whilst they attempted to retain elements of their old sound, even if it meant making sure to achieve that through the production and mixing. Perhaps if the band properly embraced a change in style, it would have resulted in more suitable production and a more-confident sounding album.\n\nAll in all, Force of Habit is a transitional album that is full of songs that vary in their moods and styles. Some tracks are winners whilst others fall flat, but that's to be expected in an album of its length. It is, however, quite a shame that they didn't make more albums similar to this one and decided to break up instead, but if Exodus didn't want to change in the first place, there's nothing more that can be said and done about how they may have sounded if they stayed together. When the band reformed, returned to their roots and finally did a new album in 2004, fans welcomed Exodus back with open arms, which is understandable as the modern Exodus material has remained consistently strong and impressive, but most importantly - it's thrash. But this promising album serves as a reminder of what briefly was, and what could have been.\n",
        "\nExodus had always been a top thrash metal band throughout their career. Personally, I'm not happy with their early albums' sound. Yes, the production was not good because it was the '80s, but neither was Baloff really good, if you ask me. What's the point on having to get used to a singer's voice in order to dig his style? He lacked the fury that he obviously needed as a singer of Exodus.\n\nWhen it comes to Tempo of the Damned though, things aren't the same. The production is modern and extremely powerful, just as it should. Exodus are not like some bands who seem to sound great 'cause of the crunchy, eerie, and aged sound their producer could arrange at the time (obviously I'm refering to the '80s ). They needed intense strength and commanding might to achieve their bloodthirsty badass style. That's what the production provides them with this album. As for Souza, well, he's just what the band needed. An angry motherfucker eager and willing to kick some serious ass, full of pure hatred and sworn to devastate the auditor's ears. His hoarse voice that's squeaky from time to time is capable of delivering sheer intensity on Exodus' compositions\n\nNow, to get down to brass tacks, let's praise the thrash: aggressive, violent, mindblowing and bloodstained. There's so many sturdy, cohesive, and huge riffs that I can't really highlight just one of them, although I truly love the main riff in Blacklist. The guitars go nuts in this album, swapping rapidly from speedy, wrathful, and complex riffs to unbearably heavy ones. And while many of the thrashing rough riffs included in this album are harmonically combined with sweet leads turning into sheer greatness, mighty heavy ones, but not many slow ones, will not be missed. Both headbangers and rattleheads will have a great time listening to this.\n\nRegarding the drumming, it certainly does not disappoint the listeners. Completing the music rather than just filling in the gaps, Tom Hunting is doing some creditable work on the drums, whether keeping heavy and speedy paces or carrying out some great rattling fill-ups. Of course, extreme tempos do dominate this album, such as the main one in War Is My Shepherd, but nevertheless, they're all tempos of the damned for those who are luckily damned to eternal headbanging - us. The bass is more or less degraded, but unfortunately this is the case in almost every metal band. Be sure, though, that it has its own highlights (i.e. the beginning of Shroud of Urine). \n\nAs compositions, the songs are sheer thrash metal. The one we, the fans, live and breath for - aggressive, politically-influenced music which commands you to enter the limbo of wrath and rattleheading. Fortunately for us, the solos are just as great and skilled. While they lack pure melody, like the one Testament are able to put into their music, the skill and the inspiration Holt possesses is to be praised. Extreme vibrato-squeals are robustly blended with lightning-like tappings and wild, escalating pickings. Again, there's not a single solo that doesn't stand up to the album's quality while the solos in War Is My Shepherd, Blacklist, and Forward March are in the limelight.\n\nRegarding the lyrics, my feelings are intensively ambivalent. I mean, you gotta admit that they kick fucking ass! The lyric part Souza sings right before the beginning of the solo in Scar Spangled Banner is amazing. I've never heard a more precise description of America's flag's colors. All this barbarian obscene violence that people bear is so accurately defined. War Is My Shepherd depicts the same scene, this time from a soldier's aspect. What can you believe in when everything's falling apart if not war, the violent instinct of man? On the other hand, though, the album contains some seriously clinical cases! Have you heard Impaler or Sealed with a Fist? Sick stuff! They may be cool from our wicked metalhead-ish tastes, but they're absolutely pointless and gore. I also dislike the constant attack on Christianity. It's a theme so commonly addressed by hateful metal bands that it gets boring. I'm not a fanatic myself; I don't bother a lot with Christianity, however I do respect that for some people it means a lot and, as I wouldn't want others to offend my music, I wouldn't be very pleased to offend their values.\n\nAll in all, this album is a must have for every man who wishes to call himself a thrasher. Sturdy, great riffs, damned speedy tempos, robustly enjoyable solos, and nicely harsh vocals are what you're going to discover listening to this album. Is it worth the devotion? Yeah, it definitely is!\n",
        "\nSome albums get built up to be way more than what they actually are by virtue of who the band is, while other albums get put down as absolute flops for the same reason. But Exodus received a rare honor upon their reformation, with Zetro back at the helm, and managed to release an album that managed to do both at the same time. The resulting equilibrium between greatness and failure manifests itself as an unapologetic exercise in thrash modernity, making little pretense about trying to relive a glorious past steeped in the 80s tradition of the San Francisco Bay Area. In other words, Exodus returned to the stage with all the youthful vigor of their former incarnation with the same lineup, but painted over it with something of a middle-aged exterior by virtue of the stylistic direction chosen.\n\nTo put it one plainly, \"Tempo Of The Damned\" is a gray affair after the likes of late 90s Overkill and Pantera when it rides in mid-tempo, and generally resembles the comeback albums of their California compatriots Heathen and Death Angel when driving forth at full speed. Zetro's vocals have taken on a much nastier and more nasally character that is heavily reminiscent of the modern sleaze-bag shriek of Blitz Ellsworth, though a little more throaty and not quite as exaggerated. This approach tends to work well with the stripped down, repetitive character of the riffing style that is employed, which really isn't all that different from the pounding, somewhat overproduced character of this era's follow up album \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\". In fact, were it not for Zetro's wicked snarls on such laid back groove-mongers like \"Blacklist\" and \"Forward March\" (the latter sounds like it was partially lifted off of \"Bloodletting\"), these songs would fall absolutely flat for the slow and minimal amount of musical activity.\n\nWhile at times this album really feels like its about to cut loose and go along a route of absolute ass-kicking in the mold of more recent Overkill albums (\"Ironbound\"), something always seems to drag this thing back down to earth rapidly. \"Scar Spangled Banner\" has all the makings of a skull-pulverizing metallic machine from ear-destroying riff work and multiple tempo switches, but the overly processed drum sound and almost digital guitar chug gives more of a \"Far Beyond Driven\" feel, complete with the needlessly profane tough guy posturing in the lyrics. \"Sealed With A Fist\" and \"Throwing Down\" pretty well descend into full out groove mode, and barely manage to stay interesting when Zetro isn't wailing away. The final 2 songs see a return to a more thrash-infused riffing approach and an abandonment of the Phil Anselmo lyrical worship, and this time the riff work manages to be busy and more in line with the brilliance of their 80s work, though still communicated through a modern production.\n\nThis isn't the sort of album that inspires outright excitement, but it does have more things going for it than its harshest critics might suggest. It's almost as if Gary Holt and the others wanted to mash every era of modern post-thrash metal that they missed out on between 1992 and 2003 into this thing, and the result is an album that listens like its stuck in two different eras, neither of them anywhere near what those hoping for a sequel to \"Bonded By Blood\" would expect, though something along that line has been done a couple times with varying success among younger revivalist bands. Then again, this is the sort of album that Machine Head might aspire to if Robb Flynn decided to stick to his guitar and hire a capable vocalist.\n",
        "\nIt can be plainly stated that the politically charged lyrics that tended to dominate latter 80s and early 90s thrash metal were not for everybody in the scene, and more particularly those who had grown more attached to the more occult-based and vile character of the early to mid 80s. However, the amount of derision thrown at a number of otherwise classic later thrash albums borderlines on sheer ridiculousness, particularly when it gets thrown at albums that didn't really mellow out musically. True, albums like Testament's \"Practice What You Preach\" were definitely not cream of the crop, and even a better representation in Xentrix's \"For Who's Advantage?\" shouldn't be treated as the absolute final word in the genre, but equivocation between a handful of duds and an undeniable hard-hitter of an album in \"Impact Is Imminent\" is where the line should be drawn.\n\nFrom start to finish, this album is a punchy wrecking machine of riffs and attitude that rivals Overkill's \"Horrorscope\" in how easily it kicks the teeth right out of one's mouth. With all the speed and madness of something more readily heard out of Vio-Lence's \"Eternal Nightmare\", the runaway train that is the title song \"Impact Is Imminent\" is arguably one of the best songs out of the entire Exodus catalog. The crunch factor from the guitars and the irreverent snarls of Steve Souza meld together perfectly and, at times, almost sound like they might have influenced the handiwork of the two latest Overkill albums. And not being one to be pigeon-holed into only being on their A game when cooking at full speed, \"Only Death Decides\" delivers a similar assortment of pummeling goodness at more of a mid-pace.\n\nMuch of what occurs in the middle section of this album is actually a bit slower and not quite as complex by the standards of previous albums, but it doesn't get anywhere near boring and has a lot going on to compensate for any lack of absolute mayhem going on in the rhythm guitar department. The amount of guitar gymnastics going on during lead breaks is impressive, as if a dueling twin guitar attack version of what Kirk Hammett did on \"...And Justice For All\" was translated into the arrangement, only without the overuse of the wah pedal and some actual feeling apart from sheer venting being present. Souza's vocal assault also brings an interesting twist into the occasion, taking on a slightly sleazier character and when combined with the frequent gang chorus chime-ins gives this a slight Anthrax flavor.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that really holds this album back a little is that the pacing is a bit heavy on the speed around the edges while the middle is largely lingering in mid-tempo land. The cut-throat speed and aggression of \"Impact Is Imminent\" sets the bar really high, and it doesn't quite get met again until near the end with \"Changing Of The Guard\", another fast paced highlight of this album that manages to maintain a faster and furious tempo for most of the time while going through a whole series of twists and turns reminiscent of Metallica's finer moments on \"...And Justice For All\", though with a much more optimistic view of a more specific political outcome. And things end on an even higher note still with the punk-infused thrasher \"Thrash Under Pressure\", clocking in at under 3 minutes yet cutting heads with the same ferocity as its near 7 minute predecessor.\n\nWhat it ultimately comes down to with this album in relation to the previous 2 (for those who have heard the band's 80s catalog but not this one) is roughly the same divide that separated \"Peace Sells\" from \"Rust In Peace\". It's a somewhat more melodic and drawn out affair, delving into somewhat different lyrical content, but it still basically hits the mark equally as hard. It can be debated to the end of time to what extent a lot of these bands actually understood the things that they wrote about, but ultimately it all comes back to how much the musical content batters the listener into headbanging obedience, and \"Impact Is Imminent\" definitely leaves an impression, right in the upper part of the skull.\n",
        "\nThe current incarnation of modern day Exodus with Rob Dukes as a frontman has not been warmly received and with 'Exhibit B: The Human Condition' this trend is only further reinforced. It's important to note that Exodus' inability to write a decent album is not Dukes' fault, and that his incredibly bland barking vocals make him an easy scapegoat to criticise a band that has been famous for having iconic frontmen previously.\n\nThe blame falls squarely on the shoulders of guitarists Holt and Altus for once again writing a slew of uninspired riffs that inhabit an awkward grey area between adequate 'The Law' emulation and reprehensible 'Ashes of the Wake' pandering. \"March of the Sycophants\" is a prime example of the former, with a rather bouncy verse riff complimented by a couple of fast but chunky riffs to help maintain momentum despite being almost seven minutes long.\n\nUnfortunately the rest of the tracks either match or exceed this length but without the competent songwriting to keep them interesting. Every song exceeding five minutes could do without two or three of those minutes and it would greatly enhance the album. Exodus take what few good riffs they've written and drive them into the ground until you're either sick of them or they've lost all impact. When they aren't repeating themselves they shamefully draw out standard song structures with anaemic bridges, irrelevant acoustic passages and generic breakdowns. \"The Sun is My Destroyer\" is a song with four riffs in nine minutes and features a pathetic attempt at emulating the dark, subdued narration from Nausea's \"Body of Christ\". There are no attempts at building towards a powerful riff or an amazing solo section; they just play verse-chorus for far too long and then paste in that asinine quiet passage in the middle.\n\nThe solo sections are the same in every song: one guy plays and then the other does. One of them is kind of messy and the other has a better grasp of melody. It's like listening to a bizarro version of King/Hanneman; everything they produce is completely ineffectual and uninteresting.\n\nThere's no reason that 'Exhibit B' should be 78 minutes and 31 seconds long, and it is baffling that Exodus think they can write long songs. They can't write lyrics either which only further exacerbates the album length when you're stuck listening to Dukes' barking out typical dickheaded atheist anti-christian sentiment or about how much people suck. It is a complete embarrassment and a group of seasoned musicians should be capable of far more. There is nothing of worth to be found and the only emotions it manages to elicit are contempt and pity.\n\nJust fucking disband.\n",
        "\nThe 1990s, for all of their silver-linings, were defined by a period of death for most metal institutions, particularly in America. In turn, the demise of said decade brought about a rekindled interest in the old ways. Exodus was one of many classic 80s metal institutions that were resurrected in the 2000s thanks to a renewed interest in both thrash and traditional heavy metal. However, their resurgence came with a surprisingly high amount of 90s baggage, in much the same respect as Overkill (though they carried it fairly well and dropped much of it by the time \"Killbox 13\" came into being), and they came out sounding pretty damn similar to the groove infused mixed bags that were \"From The Underground And Below\", \"Necroshine\", and a few others from that period, minus a lot of the peripheral elements that made Overkill's version of grayness a little easier to digest.\n\nWhen coupled with the exit of longtime front man Steve Souza and his replacement being a virtual unknown, the modern trappings that embody \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\" put it at an immediate disadvantage. Rob Dukes brings very little to the table in terms of distinctiveness, as his mixture of gruff and nastiness has more in common with Anders Friden circa \"Clayman\" and a number of metalcore singers who've all but parroted In Flames' latter period. His work is adequate by modern standards, but generally listens like a one-dimensional affair in tough guy posturing rather than the multiple layers of angst and outrage that normally comes from a seasoned thrash vocalist. By the same token, while the riff work that dominates this album has a pretty strong affinity with the punchy and catchy nature of the late 80s Bay Area sound, the hyper-slick production and overloud guitar sound obscure it to the point that it listens largely like the follow up to \"Reinventing The Steel\" that never happened, even though it is actually more intricate than anything Pantera ever put out.\n\nAs with a number of modern thrash albums, things tend to work better the shorter and faster things are kept on here. Long, drawn out numbers with occasional glory moments like \"Altered Boy\" do a respectable job of playing up the groove factor in a reasonably multifaceted fashion, but it just drags on too long and the monotony of the vocal sound does little to help matters. Even \"Deathamphetamine\", which is more thrashing than groovy, just drags on too long and has too many low points to really beat the sense out of the hearer the way it should. The real strong points of this album are found on \"Raze\", \"44 Magnum Opus\" and the closing title track where things are kept short and the neck-wrecking mayhem remains constant. Even when the lyrics start to sound moderately retarded and the vocals start to grate like nails on a chalkboard, the speed factor and Holt's signature and inventive riff work manages to keep thing interesting.\n\nThe mixed reaction of praise and scorn heaped upon this album is among the more logical reactions regarding the actual nature of a thrash album over the course of the past 10 years. Even when casting aside the history and legacy of the Exodus name, this album is a mixed bag of stomping skulls into dust power when it's on its game, and just barely avoiding hypnotic overlong drudgery when it's off, and proves to be discount bin treasure for those looking for a complete Exodus collection and a worthy pickup for groove fans who didn't get enough of the 90s version of the style. Loyalists be warned; if consistency is a requirement, you may want to skip this one.\n",
        "\nLike many fans of old school thrash metal, I'm not particularly big on the concept of rerecording an entire classic album, especially given the inherent inferiority of modern thrash recording techniques. This isn't to say that all modern sounding \"gray\" thrash metal is necessarily bad, but it largely pales in comparison to the rawer, leaner and meaner approach that ruled the tape-trading world in the 1980s. However, Exodus is definitely treading in dangerous waters in attempting to rework their magnum opus \"Bonded By Blood\" with the same approach that gave us \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\". The sound on said 2005 Exodus album, which has since become the standard of their present sound, is possessed of a certain level of charm from a standpoint of sound levels and heaviness but doesn't really work well within the template of 80s thrash.\n\nIt has been stated that this inferior rendering of \"Bonded By Blood\" dubbed \"Let There Be Blood\" is borderline metalcore, which is true in a sense, but also somewhat deceptive. This is more along the lines of what a metalcore band attempting a modernized version of retro-thrash would sound like, and the result is very different from a typical Trivium or As I Lay Dying album. You can hear some frightening similarities between the vocalists of both those groups and Rob Dukes' gimpy, pseudo melodeath shout; a sound heavily borrowed from the Anders Friden catalog of the early 2000s, but otherwise the character of the music is a bastardized, yet clearly non-metalcore take on the style. The formula has varying degrees of offensiveness, the worst offenders being the slower songs like \"No Love\" which listen like a mishmash of mid 90s Pantera worship with a sliver of 90s Overkill when the tempo picks up.\n\nBy the same token, when the faster and somewhat more busy songs are in question, this album starts to take on something akin to a poor man's \"Bloodletting\" or \"Necroshine\". Specifically on \"Exodus\", \"Metal Command\" and \"Piranha\" the feel is a bit more agitated and manages to work a little better with the modern production character, almost as if channeling some of the stronger elements of recent works along the lines of what Heathen and Death Angel have been putting out, or at least that of Dublin Death Patrol. From a purely instrumental standpoint, everything is in good working order, from the wild guitar soloing to the bruising feel of the riffs and the battery of the bass and drums. Nevertheless, the fatal flaw in all of this is that even when at its best, this album shouts out the shortcomings of its stylistic attributes in relation to the original versions of these songs, as if an elaborate art work that confesses its own lack of purpose.\n\nIt can be said with confidence that this album came out as good as it could have given the musicians involved and the professed goal of modernizing the songs of \"Bonded By Blood\". The problem lay in the very concept of trying to modernize a classic and legendary album in the first place, not to mention tapping an inferior vocalist with the task of filling the shoes of the dearly departed icon Paul Baloff. Anyone who has heard the original album in question and treats it with the level of devotion that it is worthy of will not be able to get much enjoyment out of this, though it wouldn't be impossible for younger fans who just recently discovered Bay Area thrash metal through the present works of several reformed outfits from the 80s to like what's on here. If it weren't for these songs already existing in a superior form and the fact that Rob Dukes isn't a convincing front man, this could maybe pass for a 2nd rate 90s Overkill album, but as is it isn't really much to even sneeze at, let alone blow money on.\n",
        "\nHoly shit. The album that got me into Exodus. I still consider this album to be on-par with Bonded By Blood. When you look at a band's discography, inevitably all their new releases will be compared with the past ones, which can sometimes be a blessing, or a curse for that album. Yes, Bonded By Blood is absolutely fucking menacing. But I still think that Gary Holt and co. have produced an excellent masterpiece in Tempo Of The Damned. Even the name of the album, and the album art are masterpieces. They fit Exodus so well.\n\nThis album does a similar thing for Exodus as South Of Heaven did for Slayer, and for that I'm really grateful. It showed that Exodus could be nasty, gritty, and pissed off without playing at their signature lightning speeds. This album does however, have outstanding faster moments, including the opening track, Scar Spangled Banner, as well as War Is My Shepherd, Forward March, and the closing and title track, Tempo Of The Damned. This album incorporates a nice diversity of speeds, while retaining the same general feel throughout the album. The groove is undeniable, with songs like Throwing Down and Shroud Of Urine scattered throughout the album.\n\nMost of these songs utilize eerie or unconventional riffing in order to create these interesting grooves, and to some degree this is also incorporated into Holt's solos. I think it's fairly obvious that Gary Holt is willing to try new things, which I think a lot of younger metal bands could learn from and use to their advantage. There are some bands that release several albums of incredibly similar material, however Exodus is one of those bands that proves why their music was successful in the first place (which is the founders' ability and passion for innovation). The drums can present some interesting rhythms at times, however some fills I still find to this day to be a bit unnecessary on some songs. All-in-all though, Tom Hunting is an incredible drummer and for the most part comes up with beats that not only suit the music, but help it progress, where otherwise it would not.\n\nThis album also marks the return of an older Exodus song, written with Kirk Hammett, from the 80s. This song is called Impaler. And that's exactly what it will do to you when you listen to it. It will impale you. Hardcore. This is Zetro's last chance to showcase his voice on a truly punishing Exodus track, and boy does he make use of this. It's just something that you have to hear.\n\nThere are so many good riffs all through this album, it really just depends on your taste as to which you warm to the most. For more old-school fans, War Is My Shepherd will be a must, however new-school fans may like Throwing Down more, or people new to the metal scene might take an interest in the very catchy Blacklist.\n\nGo out and get this album. If you're used to Pleasures Of The Flesh and Bonded By Blood, do yourself a favour and listen to this, to provide yourself with the ever-high-quality musicianship of Exodus, backed by a previously untapped musical vibe.\n",
        "\nThis is the PERFECT thrash masterpiece! If you call yourself a metal fan you must own this record. All nine songs kick your ass into submission and make you headbang until you're concussed. \n\nFor starters, Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are by far the best guitar duo in metal history. They just lay one unrelenting riff after another on this album and don't get me started on the trade off solos. Second, Steve Zetro Souza, although he has a unique voice that takes some getting used to, puts on his best performance here. John Tempesta of White Zombie does a solid job on drums, but he's no Tom Hunting. Rob Mckillop's bass, like on most thrash albums, is inaudible. \n\nAll the songs on this album are solid and there is absolutely no filler to be found. The title track opens the album and has a faster pace than most of record. The lyrics are humorous and Zetro's vocals are great on this track, but it has the most underwhelming solo on the album. A.W.O.L. is next. It's a slightly slower-paced track and sets the tone for what's to come. The Lunatic Parade, a mid-paced track that's probably the slowest on the album, is very similar to Toxic Waltz, a fan favorite from the previous record, Fabulous Disaster. Within The Walls Of Chaos is a nearly eight minute track that has a great solo and very nice riffs throughout. Objection Overruled, the single that received a video, is a quicker-paced humorous song about the judicial system and is one of Souza's strongest efforts (the videos pretty funny if you feel like checking it out). Only Death Decides is one of the more serious tracks and has one of the coolest riffs of all time to go with an awesome solo. Heads They Win, Tails You Lose is a track that's so long it may take a few listens before you can appreciate it. Changing of the Guard is another more serious track that has more tempo changes and a nice vocal track by Souza once again. Thrash Under Pressure, which is the fastest-paced song on the album, is probably the only low point of the album.\n\nRecommended tracks: Within the Walls of Choas, Impact is Imminent, Only Death Decides, Heads They Win, Tails You Lose.\n",
        "\n\"This song ain't about no goldfish, and it ain't about no tuna fish, and it ain't about no trout! This song is called Piranha!!!\"\n\nWords spoken by the biggest metalhead ever. Exodus are originally from the good old Bay Area thrash movement along with bands like Possessed and Forbidden. What sticks out for me on this album is that the lyrics mainly talk about Lucifer, black magic, the occult, and the usual kind of stuff, but when I listen to the music and vocals, it doesn't seem Satanic. No, in fact it just seems like getting out aggression. I think Paul's vocal style fits superbly with this album, a true master at metal (R.I.P.)\n\nThe band's guitar solos aren't as fast and hardcore like Slayer's or Possessed's, but they have their own quality and are just right for this album. Now let's get down to the songs. Like other metal albums, this one has a title track, and a great one at that, too. Next we have the title track for the band. Not too bad, but nothing to get excited about. Alright, now were getting to the goods with songs like \"And Then There Were None,\" which I think at one part the guitars sound really evil, but is kind of spoiled by Baloff's vocals. \"A Lesson in Violence\" takes me on a headbanging thrill ride of just wanting to thrash around in a mosh (don't they all though?). \"Metal Command\" tells about obeying your metal rights and fighting for them. Now here's an interesting track for you: \"Piranha\", a song not about aggression or Satanism, but about piranha. My favorite track on the album. To speed things up we ave other great tracks like \"No Love\", the long and evil \"Deliver Us to Evil\", and the fast \"Strike of the Beast\".\n\nNow, you can't go wrong with this album if you love metal, but why wouldn't you if you're on this website? This was Exodus at their finest, thrashiest, and pure and simply evil. Now they did release other greats like \"Fabulous Disaster\" and \"Impact is Imminent\", but for me you have to choose \"Bonded By Blood\", a gem that will forever glow for eternity in the ever-growing thrash metal world. You can be certain of yourself that this album has influenced tons of soon-to-come metal bands and has brought years of joyful headbanging.\n",
        "\nExodus is back motherfuckers! In 2004, after over 10 years an hiatus, the band decided to attempt a big comeback with everyone from the original lineup in tow. Unfortunately, after the live epic \"Another Lesson In Violence\", fantastic original vocalist Paul Baloff passed on from a stroke. Now armed with a returning Steve Souza, the team were determined to head back into the studio to record a brand new brusier of an album. The result was \"Tempo of the Damned\", which more or less lives up to expectations.\n\nMost of the classic lineup is here and accounted for. Zetro's vicious, raspy thrash vocals are in killer form. His usual injections of humor are mostly absent here, aside from some dark sarcasm. Holt and Hunolt's guitars are damn strong as well, particularly the seasoned lead shredding of Holt. The man knows how to conjure up a blasting solo yet. The bass of semi new guy Jack Gibson has that notable crunch found in numerous thrash albums these days thanks the injection a modern, loud production. He has a few pretty solid moments like fills and short solos, adding more than Rob McKillop ever has. Tom Hunting returns on the drums, though it seems to me that he never got it back together after \"Pleasure of the Flesh\". He' still solid, but mostly just plods along with boring tap-taps, and even in the faster songs his fails to make an impression.\n\nExodus has always had something of a flair for groove thrashin', and this album takes some of the groove metal tendencies to their highest level. Still, most of the songs on this particular album are so bloodcurdlingly AWESOME and vicious that it doesn't even fucking matter! Hell the grooving even helps a bit! \"Tempo\" starts off with not one, not two, but THREE killer tracks to get heads rolling. \"Scar-Spangled Banner\", with its wily anti-patriotic lyrics, buzzsaw riffing and big structure make for a killer start. Next: \"WAAAAAAR! WAAAAAAR! WAAAAAAAR! WAR IS MY SHEPARD!!!\" Some of Zetro's most unhinged and evil vocals run amok here in this downright brutal speeder. In third is the stomping, somewhat anthemic \"Blacklist\", a personal favorite. Though it has some of those groovy tendencies, it's still a fun song, rife with entertaining lyrics, a really neat solo and a big, memorable hooky chorus. The rest of the songs go here and there in quality. Some good ones include the super-vicious title track, the groove-heavy speeder \"Sealed With A Fist\", the NWOBHM-flavored \"Impaler\", and the religion-crushing \"Shroud of Urine\". \"Culling The Herd\" is okay, with more cool lyrics, but it just sort of comes and goes. \"Forward March\" has some of those infamous vocals that border on rapping, but is otherwise a decent thrasher. Beware completely of \"Throwing Down\", a lousy all-out groover that reeks of second-rate Machine Head (or, you know...Machine Head).\n\nOverall, while the groove tendencies do this album no real favors, they don't terribly hurt either, though a few tracks are lousy and do deem being skipped. The others, though, flat out fucking rule, and the near-full classic lineup is, mostly, in great from here, rocking away like no time passed. Recommended!\n",
        "\nAnything could have been a step up from \"Pleasure of the Flesh\". I felt that album was a serious misstep, a good attempt at bigger, more technical thrash but spoiled by an overtly clean production and a lack of imagination. Exodus put out their 3rd album, \"Fabulous Disaster\", close to the ass end of 1988. Everything that could have been done right on \"Pleasures\" is done, well, fabulously here. \n\nFirst off, the production. We thankfully go back to a loud, raw style reminiscent of \"Bonded\" that nicely compliments the band's attitude and style. Second, the writing. The attempts at humor on \"Pleasures\" was infrequent and poorly thought-out, while here we get a wild plethora of fun sarcasm and irony added on to the usual thrash aggression.\n\nThird, the band. The same group from \"Pleasures\" shows up here, and on this album they clearly sound like they're having a blast making these songs. Zetro's vocals are wilder and a bit less clean here, his style coming full circle. Still raspy and ragged, with his notable sense on self-awareness and sarcasm coming through in the singing, as it were. Holt and Hunolt's guitars really rip on this record. Very sharp, still highly technical, and solos of really heavy quality to be found here, though any major main riffs are still hard-pressed to be found. McKillop's bass is still a bit hard to hear, but not too bad; just listen to that great, razor-sharp hum. Hunting's drumming, however, is a bit more bland here than his work on the last two. Not bad, just okay and competent. Don't expect as much of the guy's usual aggression.\n\nThe songs suffer slightly from the odd intro or sound bit or some so-so filler moments, but the tracklist here is mostly a pretty solid listen overall. Starting off with the one-two punch of \"Last Act of Defiance\" and the title track, the latter of which has another lengthy intro, we are treated to hyperactive solos and ruthless guitar work, with Zetro's crazed vocals. The great \"Toxic Waltz\" follows; it's catchy as holy hell, and the lyrics are some of the most fun on the album. After the first three, \"Fabulous Disaster\" sorta goes hit or miss. The cover of \"Low Rider\", while not terrible, sounds out of place. The song \"Corruption\" also kinda goes nowhere; there's nothing too terribly special about it. The other good ones are the epic, evil, mid-paced \"Like Father, Like Son\" with its HUGE, awesome solo, the extremely aggressive \"Verbal Razors\" with its spitfire vocals and guitars, and the fun \"Open Season\" with more entertaining lyrics, and of course killer guitars. That Holt is a fucking madman genius. \n\nOverall, it does carry a few of the problems \"Pleasures\" came with (ie sound bits/intros, some off humor,a few skippable songs), but it's far more few and far in between here. The performance of the band is infectious, and the better songs on the album are a damn blast. Recommended to compliment that ever-growing thrash collection of yours.\n",
        "\nI'll just add my two cents. This is one of those albums that everyone has already said absolutley everything about. I just wanna sing my praises for this mean motherfucker as well. That said...BONDED BY BLOOD!\n\nYou heard everything right, folks. This IS one of the original thrash albums (nearly neck and neck with \"Feel The Fire\"). It IS one of the most ferocious and positively evil metal experiences you'll ever get ear-raped by. The late, great Paul Baloff will fucking shred your mortal physical husk down to the last atom with his homicidal, uncontrollable vocals. From a technical standpoint, he can't actually sing, but who cares when this great man is tearing your brain a new one with little more than his voice! Yes, Gary Holt and fellow cohort Rick Hunolt will obliterate your unready ass with their combined weight of uncontrollable, yet eerily technical guitar shredding. Think the guitars from \"Kill 'Em All\", but 666 times more vicious. Tom Hunting comes in on a fast attack with his unholy drumming; basically just double bass jackhammering, but man can this guy make it sound putrid and perfect. To be fair though, he does have some okay technical fills himself. Rob McKillop is on bass, or maybe not; you can't really hear it in this mix like many metal records in those days, but if he were more audible, I'm damn sure he'd add to the madness, too!\n\nThe songs are split into unhinged speeders and crushing mid-paced numbers. Good crushers include the epic \"Deliver Us To Evil\", its guitars ongoing in riff after riff in a frenzy of a long solo. HAHAHAHA! \"And Then There Were None\" is great too, with some of Baloff's more \"mellow\" (tee-hee, yeah right) vocals and some odd gang vox, but it's these speeders ya gotta love. The screeching \"Metal Command\" and the similar, slightly less aggressive title track come at ya with a flurry of guitars and drumming, truly commanding the listener to bang until nothing but blood and teeth remain. The classic \"A Lesson In Violence\" hurts all haters with its big, mean chorus and loud, evil solo. Then we have the legendary...\"PIRANHA!\"...\"if you think you can live, you're a fool!\". This is maybe the best song on here, having a simple, headbangable main riff, completely out of control screaming, and best off all, the entire second half of the song is Gary Holt going ape shit! \n\nOverall, if you don't own this, you are NO metal fan! It's that simple. Get it now.\n",
        "\nAfter the legendary \"Bonded By Blood\" in 1985, the sky seemed like the limit for Exodus. Two years and one new singer later came \"Pleasures of the Flesh\" in 1987. The result: it wasn't \"Bonded By Blood\". In fact, it's so not \"Bonded By Blood\" that it hurts. That album was raw, fast, and straightforward. \"Pleasures\" is a different, somewhat annoying beast entirely. \n\nFirst off, the production doesn't suit the music. It's too clean-cut and clear; \"Bonded\" comes out on top in this regard thanks to a raw, low-budget production. Second, the lyrics. We have lots of unusual plays on words and an odd sense of humor that would become an Exodus mainstay in their music; this goes over better on albums like \"Impact Is Imminent\" or especially \"Fabulous Disaster\". But here, it seems so stale and out of place.\n\nThird, then new guy Steve \"Zetro\" Souza. He remains controversial today, but frankly I don't mind him. His style is good enough; sort of an American Udo Dirkschnieder channeling a peppering of Baloff. Everyone else from the last album is in tow. Holt and Hunolt ( that could get confusing) get aggressively technical again, saving a number of songs with passable riffs and solos. McKillop's bass is a bit more audible this time, but not enough to really make a major difference; there's always that hum. Hunting bashes out the kit once more. This time he stretches his creativity a bit more here, mixing more technical moments with the occasional double bass/snare slaughter. \n\nEasily the most disappointing aspect here are the songs themselves. Riffs tend to just come and go, and there's nothing terribly noteworthy. There's an unfortunate lack of notable soloing as well; Hunolt and Holt just sort of riff and shred, allowing for servicable headbanging but little else. A number of songs are also cursed with those annoying intros or bizarre sound samples, like the overlong, stupid intro to \"Deranged\", the silly jungle sounds that start the title track or the completely pointless \"30 Seconds\". A few tracks like the fearsome \"Brain Dead\" or cool tracks like \"Faster Than You'll Ever Live To Be\" or \"Choose Your Weapon\" benefit from the merciless shredding and at least a few decent throwaway riffs, but at the end of the day it comes off lackluster. \n\nOverall, this album isn't terribly bad so much as disappointing. The band performs nicely but the songs suffer from the overly high-end production, resulting in more timid thrashing. Sure some aggression and headbangibility are to be found, but the oh so so-so amount of songs kill any chances of the listener giving this mother another spin anytime soon. Don't expect \"Bonded By Blood\", which is a problem.\n",
        "\nEvery time this insult to the real album, Bonded by Blood, is sold, the mighty Paul Baloff rolls over in his mother fucking grave. \n\nFirst and foremost, my biggest complaint (among many others): Rob Dukes. The \u201csinger\u201d. Why? He sucks. Hard. He belongs in a screamy mallcore band, NOT a legendary old-school thrash outfit. He couldn't sing if he had to: No range, emotion, skill, anything that makes a vocalist a GOOD vocalist. His vocals are just mindless screaming that have an uncanny knack for penetrating into the migraine centers of my brain with ease. \n\nThis has to have been explained by previous users, but just for the sake of assertion, I'll still allude it: The early 80s lyrics were not meant for 2008 musical performance and studio production. In the words of a man you might have heard of named Lars Ulrich, \"If you heard bands like Korn back then, you'd have lost your lunch!\" It's just that with the lifeless, mechanical, crystal clear production, the glaringly slowed pace, the low, mile-thick guitar tone, and everything else not 1985 about this album makes the original lyrics, just, not fit. I suppose you'd have to hear it to fully understand the sentiment.\u00a0Also regarding the lyrics, in\u00a0case you're wondering what the title of my review is making reference to, it's Rob's cute little improvisation at the end of No Love, after the iconic closer Paul once delivered \"Your body starts to smell!\", Rob throws in a redundant, profane travesty for the teenaged listeners, \"It smells like fucking shit!\"\n\nMy third biggest complaint: This album's ambiguity. I hope there's no need to remind you that thrash is no stranger to being obscure, especially the kind that is so underground that the fans haven't even heard of it, but this, this is just a waste of the vinyl it's printed on. It's a pointless mockup thrown together without any real purpose other than making money. The original album was just fine. This is nothing but a sellout. A shameless, pointless, cash-in. I know that the appropriately named atrocity that preceded this and its predecessor, Shit-headed whatevertuffguybullshittheynamedit, could be described as a mallcorish sellouts as well, but trust me when I say that this is worse. \n\nAll in all, unless you're a fifteen-year-old metalcore fan looking for something with \"OMG, soo meny gitar soloz!\", this really sucks. Please refrain from buying it, for if you do, you're just playing into its only real purpose. If you don't want to take my word for just how horribad it really is, just search \"Exodus Let there be blood\" on YouTube, and prepare to get really, really angry. \n\nRIP Paul Baloff.\n",
        "\n25 years of Exodus and we\u2019re still Bonded by Blood, bang your head as if up from the dead, intense metal is all that you need!!\n\nIn comes Exodus\u2019s sequel to their 2007 album The Atrocity Exhibition, Exhibit B: The Human Condition. This, like its prequel, is a concept album and incorporates the same elements like lengthy epic songs and theme-based songwriting about war and death as opposed to their traditional writing about violence and killing poseurs. What can be seen here is that as time progresses, so does production, much to the dismay of old school fans who still prefer the recording quality of the eighties; it is believed that it has got something to do with \u201cstaying true to your roots\u201d. But the production does not take away the conventionality of the music as Gary Holt delivers riff after riff of pure thrashing ecstasy.\n\nThe album starts off with \"The Ballad of Leonard and Charles\" with quite a surprise element in the intro, given the acoustic guitars quite opposed to their \u201cpedal to the floor\u201d approach with lightning fast intros. It's one minute into the song before the distortion kicks in and the sheer joy of Rob Dukes' voice, this album being only his third with Exodus. The good old bashing and thrashing is what you find in the second song, \"Beyond The Pale\". The song has quite a few beautiful guitar licks and mind-bending soloing from both Holt and Lee. The line \u201cI know not that which I\u2019ve become Exhibit A in man\u2019s atrocity\u201d is pretty thought-provoking. The whole song is actually about murderers and the way they face the judicial system. \"Hammer and Life\", the third song, has made itself quite the anthem of the album, being released quite sometime ago as a single and lives up to the expectations of any thrash fan as a standard straightforward 3 minute song. \"Class Dismissed\", yet another epic track, stretches over 7 minutes and, man, didn\u2019t these guys ever think it would be easier to write shorter songs. The quality of the riffs and vocals remains undiminished, however by this time the epicness of the songs seems to have become quite the cliche, bearing in mind the last album as well. \"Downfall\" begins with a melodic riff that reminds you of the band Mercenary somehow, but the solo takes the cake and is easily one of the best on the album. Five minutes into the track it gets groovier, the playing building up to the mad drumming that introduces you to the next track, \"March Of The Sycophants\". It's one of the songs on the album that you might want to skip, honestly, with nothing great to deliver. \"Nanking\", another lengthy track that follows, gets groovy at points for a saving grace, I must say. \"Burn, Hollywood, Burn\", the 8th track, makes a quick and exquisite impact with sensational abuses aimed directly at Paris Hilton and Miley Cyrus (who in reality do form a part of mankind\u2019s scum, at least in my opinion). It's a song that makes quite the strong point, making you sit up and think \u201cnow why didn\u2019t anyone else say that?\u201d. The song leads to \"Democide\" which has quite a Middle Eastern intro, but it's a damn monotonous song with not much to it. \"The Sun Is My Destroyer\", the 10th song, is the longest song on the album, stretching over nine minutes. Dukes sounds a little more aggressive than necessary. A real tester of patience this one, heh, sort of like too many riffs piled up to make a song. This is followed by \"A Perpetual State Of Indifference\", the shortest track and a relieving one too. This is an instrumental, after all Dukes does need a break after spewing out so much hatred and dismay for so long. \"Good Riddance\", the last track, is quite ironic in its name as well considering the impatient metal head who\u2019s put himself through this album. That\u2019s not me by the way, haha. The song is actually about the world ending with some catchy pentatonic wankery on this track and a beautiful acoustic outro that's very well-crafted with no better way to end the album.\n\nThe album overall has no stand out song really as Exodus seem to be lacking in the anthem bit somehow, although \"Hammer and Life\" seems to make the cut, yet it doesn\u2019t quite make the same impact as, well, say \"The Toxic Waltz\" from the album Fabulous Disaster. It doesn\u2019t define Exodus\u2019s sound and definitely is not one of the songs that is likely to become a headbanger\u2019s anthem. It's true that they\u2019ve changed in line up as well as band sound, but the basic element of \u201cgiving you the kick\u201d is missing, and the lengthy songs that stretch over 7 minutes do this bit no good either. The album is produced very well and every instrument sounds just as good as the person playing it. The guitar tone does sound a little crunchy at certain points, but doesn\u2019t really give you reason to complain. All said and done, Exodus do live up to their standards and remain untouchable as ever as thrash gods, leaving behind a promise that they will stay so for a few more years to come, for sure.\n\nI would like to dedicate this review to the memory of Paul Baloff, the late Exodus vocalist who was featured only on their first album, Bonded By Blood. May he rest in peace, for as beautiful as Dukes\u2019 voice may be, his voice will echo for decades to come.\n",
        "\nSince Exodus came \u2018off hiatus\u2019 in 2004 to release Tempo Of The Damned with former singer Zetro, the band has gone from strength to strength with each additional release, utilizing the vocal talents of new frontman Rob Dukes for Shovel Headed Kill Machine and Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A and have written some of their most intense and aggressive songs to date. Exhibit B: The Human Condition follows that trend. In fact, this album is probably the band\u2019s most grandiose effort to date. It\u2019s the sound of a band doing things their way with opener \u2018The Ballad Of Leonard & Charles\u2019 being a massive brutal slab of thrash in the classic Exodus style. An acoustic intro gives way to vicious riffing from Gary Holt and Lee Althus. The guitars weave frantic harmonies, making this seven minute track seem to feel half the time and reeks of epic! In fact, epic is good way to describe the entire album. clocking in at 72 minutes long, this can be a testing listen if you're not familiar with the band. \n\nThe majority of the album is comprised of trademark Exodus thrash gallop with precision riffing from Holt and Althus, and tracks such as Beyond The Pale, Downfall and Burn Hollywood Burn reek of class, the latter being a Gary Holt penned tirade against reality TV and the wannabe celebrities it creates. \n\nElsewhere on Exhibit B the band shift the gears down a notch, most notable on Nanking which tells the story of the atrocities committed by the Japanese army upon the city of Nanking in 1937. Here the band drop into a slow menacing groove that grinds its way through the track. \n\nExodus have never been a band to be subtle and Exhibit B is a brutal as it is magnificent. Is it too long at 72 minutes? Admittedly, they could trim 20 minutes from the album and still have a classic on their hands! When all is said and done, Exhibit B: The Human Condition is one hell of a thrashfest from the undisputed kings of bay area thrash.\n",
        "\n\u201cPleasures of the Flesh\u201d seems to be the forgotten Exodus album. I\u2019m not sure why, I just haven\u2019t heard much about this album. This marks the first album with Zetro and this album kills. \n\nThe production is better than \u201cBonded by Blood\u201d but honestly, not by much. The guitars are still pretty thin but are heavier than the debut. The drums sound way better but the snare is so damn loud it kind of hides the rest of the drums. The bass is still too quiet and you don\u2019t really ever hear it except for a few parts, (\u201cBrain Dead\u201d). With all these things, I\u2019d still take this production over their later albums since they've had the exact same sound since \"Tempo\". \n\nZetro\u2019s vocals on here are fantastic. He had big shoes to fill after Paul, and I think he did so quite well. I don\u2019t think this is his best performance but he did an amazing job.\n\nAlthough still slower than the debut, (but most albums are), this album still delivers in the speed department. \u201cDeranged\u201d starts with a talking intro that sounds pretty deranged (HA) and then the speed kicks in just like on \u201cBBB\u201d. The riffs on this album are just amazing. \u201cTil Death Do Us Part\u201d starts with a pretty cool drum intro and is one of the slower songs on here. Doesn\u2019t really pick up speed at all, but I\u2019m glad they did this because I prefer a few mid-paced songs rather than 100mph all the time. Where the second track didn\u2019t deliver with blistering speed, they make up for it \u201cParasite\u201d. \u201cBrain Dead\u201d is another slower song with some awesome gang vocals. \u201cFaster Than You\u2019ll Ever Be\u201d is exactly what you expect from the title; fast, fast, and fast. It is very reminiscent of the first album and is just an awesome song with some very heavy riffs. The title track starts with an intro that sounds like you\u2019re about to eaten by cannibals and goes into a cool riff. This song has a very good mixture of mid-paced and speed. \u201c30 Seconds\u201d is 42 seconds and is just a guitar part. I guess it\u2019s a good breather from all the thrash you just went through, maybe as a joke, who knows? \u201cSeeds of Hate\u201d is my personal favorite from this album. The drum intro is awesome and the riff is catchy and is just amazing. Tom Hunting also shows off his double bass skills on this song especially. \u201cChemi-Kill\u201d has a pretty catchy chorus and is another mid-paced song. The last track is a good thrashing closer to a great album. \n\nThis album seems to be overlooked and I can\u2019t figure out why. If you liked \u201cBBB\u201d, you will love this album, and if you don\u2019t then I don\u2019t know what to tell you, this is true classic Exodus. \n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cSeeds of Hate\u201d, \u201cParasite\u201d, and \u201cFaster Than You\u2019ll Ever Be\u201d\n",
        "\nWoooohoo this is bad... not like Reanimator or Acid Reign bad, I'm talking like Metallica S&M bad; almost like they should have been aware of their wrongdoings, yet they knew better and carried on anyways.\n\n\nFirst off, Rob Douche has the most mismatched vocals I could imagine for this re-recording. That may be a stretch, but his vocals are over-the-top-mallcore-grunting-stump-fuckingly bad. His entire vocal approach does not suit this genre of music, let alone a re-recording of one of the most legendary and ground-breaking metal releases of all time.\n\nSecondly, and just as importantly, the tempo/drum performance. Come to think of it, I resent Tom Hunting's drum performance more than the douchy vocals. What was he thinking? Since when does anyone re-record a thrash album at 3/4 the pace of the original? His drum set actually sounds good; the bass drum is nice and audible and eq'd well, all the cymbals aren't too loud or overwhelming and the snare is crystal clear. Regadrless, he failed miserably as his job. The original songs kicked 100 different species of ass the way they were, and changing the formula they started using 25 years ago is truly an unspeakable act against humanity. \n\nThe guitar tone. I said I loved the tone on \"Another Lesson in Violence\" so I shouldn't be hypocritical and say I don't like the tone on this album. The tone on the live album was a fresh sound at the time (1997) and had a lot more solid-state sound to it, but that's another story. I think the guitar tone on LTBB was a poor choice. It sounds like most other guitar tones I've heard on every other mainstream and thrash metal album for the last 10 years. Buy a guitar with emg's, buy a Mesa rectifier, turn the gain knob to 10 and voila! Hissy, muddy, fuzzy guitar tone that has no unique character whatsoever. For most newer bands I wouldn't really care so much, but for a band that pioneered a genre that so many of us hold dear to out hearts, I think it's totally unacceptable.\n\nThe production. Many people I've spoken to about this would argue that the production on the re-recording is \"better.\" The guitar tone is clearer, the drums and vocals are more audible, and the overall noise due to cheap recording equipment has been eliminated. Yeah, the same could be said about the new Trivium album, only their guitar tone is better. The overall tone LTBB is so ordinary, so regular, so devoid of any real character or anything that sets it apart from every modern core band nowadays it almost angers me. Take the production from Bonded By Blood. It's noisy, every instrument is a bit on the sloppy side, and Paul obviously had his way with the echo knob on the soundboard. The guitar panning is for all intents and purposes non-existant, and you can barely hear the bass. It's also original, raw, angry, inspired, has tons of energy and it makes you bang your head as if up from the fucking dead. Or it does mine, anyways. It has character. It's unique. You listen to any 2 seconds of that album and you know damn well what it is. I think this new recording deserves so much more as far as the production went.\n\nThe magic that the original Bonded by Blood had was completely and entirely lost when Let There be Blood was recorded. The production is so ordinary, the drumming sucks, and they used the wrong vocalist. If you're a fan of any type of underground 80's metal, or anything that Exodus stood for in the 80's, don't bother buying this album. You will probably regret it.\n",
        "\n\"...if you've got something to say, then come my way...\"\n\nGot time for a little story?\n\nLike GasGiant (whose review has apparently left the building), my first innocuous flirt with Exodus was an edge-of-night metal radio show (they were out there, conservatively, this one The Metal Shop, I think), one of those good semi-undergrounders where platters by Hawaii, Loudness, Tokyo Blade, and Raven actually attained regular rotation. I was a diligent listener 'cos even if something obscurely '81 got a spin, it was still freshly baked and steaming to me and a lot of others. The deejay plugged the debut of this unknown CA band with a full-throttle taste - \"A Lesson in Violence\" - which held my attention prisoner while the scathingly extroverted vocals of a cannibal allied with riffs of unhinged thrash malevolence. The bands that played before and after suddenly seemed underwhelming to me. If it wasn't around midnight I would've tried to get a ride over to the indie record store in town. \n\nSome weeks later the store gets the damn thing in and with great satisfaction I fork over the moolah I had been saving for such a joyous occasion. Mom, my ride, sees the cover and says, \"oh lovely\". Now I'm home, my poor stereo blind and deaf to what's in store for it, and Bonded by Blood fills every nook and cranny, bounces off every metal poster. \n\nTwenty six years later and I still have a hard time finding albums that can stand stiff-kneed in the ring with this. It's not only the album's fierce conveyance that keeps it on the heavy-hitters list, but its Twinkie-like shelf life, its ode to the cantankerous mid-'80s style, and the metallic promise that the common above ground devotee of general music will feign death to get out of its path. By '85, thrash's soldiers were lining up, some already battle-scarred and breathing heavy, and the primordial Bay Area sound was about as realized and developed as a corn field. Sure, it's fairly common knowledge nowadays that BBB was complete and ready for destruction in the hot months of '84, but that didn't do anyone any good. I don't even know if it would've mattered. If anything it probably would've been more affiliated with the crumbling Euro borderland (because they sound so much like Grim Reaper) most early critics were still clinging to like the 25th story ledge of a building. \n\nAs a fan, though, it would've been cool. \n\nBBB's biggest asset may be its actual dividing of its assets. The Kill 'em All-ish crossfade of hot-headed riffery and full-on toothy aggression does wonders for about half the album. B-side pounders like \"Piranha\", \"No Love\", \"And Then There Were None\", and the especially tempestuous journey of \"Deliver Us To Evil\" find their path to a birthpool of changeful (but not everchanging) rhythms and structural mutations that aren't meaninglessly absorbed, but set a balance for those sections that are fleet-fingered and remorseless. These songs revel in this demiurgic margin that make them the most interesting, circumvented tracks on the disk. \n\nCrowd killers \"Strike of the Beast\", \"Exodus\", chorus-heavy \"A Lesson in Violence\", and to a lesser degree, the rather colorless title cut and audience-pleasing \"Metal Command\" are the fervent wallopers of the post-British movement. Full of violence, virility, and vehemence, it makes me sleep better at night knowing they exist, especially the first three. As for the playful \"Metal Command\", like most anthems it doesn't really fluff my pillow, the song pretty moderate to me in all traits except the metal-coded message that always seemed obvious enough that I didn't need pop-up book images to show me what metal is. \n\nBut as far as the Kill 'em All coincidence goes, there's a contradistinctive attitude toward it not so much in musical tone, but in rows of lyrics that are much more impiously vocal as well as bloodthirsty (which is where my 'ol lady who, unbeknownst to me, was listening beyond my door, storms in and hollers over the music, \"Is this that new album you bought?! Gimme that!\", and rips the lyric sheet from my hands while telling me to turn the record off). Talk of Satan, Baphomet, black magic, princes of hell, Master Lucifer - are we calling this black metal as well or can we just finally admit (and grasp) that subjects of a wicked, occult nature were just par for the course, par for the times - scary, localized, and extreme to match the music ingesting it? \n\nThen there's the membership that's surprisingly accomplished in its unanimity, all pulled together by a superb Prairie Sun production. Tasmanian devil Paul Baloff spews liquid flame into \"the redness and the horror of blood swept across the land I stood\", a shearing anti-talent who sent vocal coaches running for their lives. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt trade solos with Hanneman/King-level chaos, perhaps even a bit better, while cinnabar-maned Tom Hunting looks possessed in his white-eyed field goal pose on the back cover. Yeah, Rob McKillop's there, too. \n\nCelebrated a hundred ways to Tuesday, up-down-right-left to stand squarely in the winner's circle, BBB maintains its stellar average that's seldom in dispute. It was almost a waste of time writing this review.\n\nSo anyway, my frazzled worry wart of an 'ol lady, inner sleeve in hand, feverishly phones her brother, my uncle (R.I.P. 6/26/17), and starts reading the pick of the lyrical litter - \"I love to stab my victims until they're dead...\" - to him. \"He shouldn't be listening to this...\" she says into the receiver. He, being about 30 at this time, had sparring matches with my grandparents about Hendrix, Zappa, and The Grateful Dead, so he's receptive to my plight and calms her worried ass down. Needless to say, I haven't pulled a Howard Unruh...yet. \n\n\"...if you think you can live, you're a fool...\"\n",
        "\nThere is no reason why I shouldn't love this album. On paper, it's got everything I've wanted out of Exodus since Bonded by Blood: louder bass, gritty vocals, and competent drumming. But for some reason, I just can't love it. On paper, this is the best Exodus album. To my ears, not so much.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a fucking killer album. It's got some of my favorite Exodus tunes on it, the production is far better than it was on the previous albums, and so on. But there's just something about it that turns me off about it. Believe me, I've tried to see what's wrong with it. But so far, I think it's the riffs and the lyrics, they're great, but not very memorable like the ones on Fabulous Disaster. \n\nNow on to the positive aspects of the album. The production, like stated before, is much better, Zetro yells like a fucking demon, John Tempesta is an acceptable replacement for Tom Hunting, the duo of Hunolt/Holt slip up a bit, but are still quite capable of kicking your ass, and you can actually hear Rob McKillop's bass. \n\nIf there's one thing that got better, though, it's the solos. I didn't care for the ones on Pleasures of the Flesh or Bonded by Blood, and they seem to have improved a lot since Fabulous Disaster. \n\nContrary to what I may seem to be saying, I actually think it's an underrated album. It's not a major fuck up, but it's not something to put on a pedestal like Fabulous Disaster. \n\nThere are some surefire classics here that kick your ass through and through until the end. Such as the title track, A.W.O.L., Thrash Under Pressure, and Objection Overruled. But most tracks have the problem of losing my attention halfway through the song. Such as Changing of the Guard, The Lunatic Parade, Only Death Decides, and Heads You Win (Tails You Lose). There's no stinker on this album, but they just don't grab me. \n\nThat being said, it's still a killer album and one of the most underrated in the Exodus catalog. If you're a new Exodus listener, then don't mind me, I'm just nitpicking, you should totally listen to it.\n",
        "\nReleased during the period where Exodus still had misguided hopes of maintaining MTV approval following the minor popularity of their \u201cToxic Waltz\u201d video, Objection Overruled was intended as a showcase for their new album Impact is Imminent. Unfortunately, it only managed to show how meager the band had become with Tom Hunting no longer in their midst, making the EP an unnecessary addition to anyone\u2019s Exodus collection.\n\n\u201cObjection Overruled\u201d is just a bit over par for what would be Impact is Imminent on a whole. Mid-paced and extremely repetitive (it feels like there\u2019s exactly one riff and one beat throughout its entirety) with the sort of clich\u00e9 socio-political lyrics you could expect for thrash of this period, this is Exodus at (almost) their most generic. It\u2019s not much of an opener, but it stands a little better here than on the album proper as it\u2019s not surrounded by other similar sounding tracks. Still a drag, though, and it looks like absolute shit compared to the other original track on here, \u201cChanging of the Guard.\u201d Again, it\u2019s kind of ridiculous in its overly political content, but man does this track slay. Lots of tempo changes, Souza\u2019s scathing vocal domination, and some of the sweetest, harmonic lead work ever produced by the band are to be found here, as well as a defiant energy that\u2019s unfortunately rare on the album proper. Could\u2019ve been on Fabulous Disaster, really.\n\nBut the \u2018exclusive\u2019 track, and the only reason to bother tracking this thing down in an average fan\u2019s mind, is a rendition of Ted Nugent\u2019s \u201cFree for All.\u201d I don\u2019t know who it was that convinced Exodus that they\u2019d be a great cover band, but they need to be flogged viciously with their own entrails. The cover is passable, but who cares? Was anyone really interested in hearing Exodus play classic rock songs when there\u2019s a wealth of obscure material they could\u2019ve been recording and releasing? Where the fuck is \u201cImpaler?\u201d Who cares if Kirk Hammett took some riffs from it, it still rules, much more so than anything Ted Nugent ever did. Sadly, Exodus would maintain an interest in such unnecessary cover tunes to this very day.\n\nIt\u2019s a frustrating little EP, as there was better material that could have been included and most of that which is included happens to be more readily available. Don\u2019t bother with it.\n",
        "\nI am of the persuasion that the unholy Exodus have never failed to produce a good studio album; even filler laden Force of Habit and modernized Shovel-Headed Kill Machine had more than enough merits to earn their badge of quality. However with The Atrocity Exhibition, Exodus break precedent by producing something that can\u2019t really be called a good album. But to be fair, they\u2019ve also produced something that can\u2019t really be called an Exodus album. Yeah, I know what it says on the cover, but I also know what it sounds like, and Exodus it surely isn\u2019t. Instead, you get the feeling that Gary Holt has long been bitter about playing second fiddle to his more revered colleagues over in Anthrax and Metallica and, with a mostly new lineup in tow for his aging thrash project, has finally decided to take a serious stab at the limelight. Holt promised a modern masterpiece; what he\u2019s delivered is essentially a rebranding of Exodus as a modern metal act.\n\nAnd what, dear friends, is more celebrated in the modern metal world (in the mainstream, not the underground) than the world-(in)famous Gothenburg sound and its close cousin metalcore? Not that this is a total conversion or anything; in fact, on a superficial level it is very much what one could expect a new Exodus album to sound like. The guitars, despite being tuned lower than one would prefer, have the same murderous crunch that pretty much every Exodus album has managed to provide and at least a few of the riffs (see: the early guitar break in \u201cFuneral Hymn\u201d and the unmistakable one in the middle of \u201cIconoclasm\u201d) are indigenous to Holt\u2019s usual sonic landscape. There\u2019s also a veritable slathering of guitar solos worthy of the names Holt and Altus; again, as should be expected. But in general, the style of riffing is quite different from Holt\u2019s thrashtastic forte, emphasizing chunky dissonant chords and disparate sludge over his signature no-nonsense battery. Some of the melodic aspects are completely foreign: I challenge you to play the intro bit \u201cA Call to Arms\u201d to an unexposed Exodus fan and have them correctly guess what it is they\u2019re listening to. I hear more elements of Soilwork, Lamb of God, Trivium, or The Haunted in this than anything else, and though that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing if you dig any of said artists, it\u2019s a bit discouraging if you, like me, were expecting it to sound like Exodus. The logical followup to Shovel-Headed Kill Machine? This strays from that path, assuredly.\n\nThe worst departure, however, is the general attitude of the record. Since Rob Dukes\u2019 arrival as Exodus\u2019 lead verbal propagandist, it is quite clear that Holt has used him as a catalyst to mold the band after Dukes\u2019 harsher, more \u2018extreme\u2019 if you will, vocal approach. As such, the band has taken upon itself a darker atmosphere, begging to be taken seriously after comical mishaps (though I certainly wouldn\u2019t call all of them mishaps) of the past decade such as \u201cThe Toxic Waltz\u201d or their rather silly cover songs. The result, naturally, is on par with other \u2018modern\u2019 metal lyrical standards and an atrocious drop in entertainment from the riotous lyrical insights of Tempo of the Damned. Here, Holt and Dukes achieve a result somewhere in between modern Slayer and modern Megadeth. Religion = bad. Politicians = bad. Yeah, message received. It\u2019s the same old song and dance thrash and plenty of heavy metal in general has been advocating for decades, in brutally detailed but redundant fashion. No one needs to hear another anti-Iraq war song, and despite a gutsy (but resoundingly intolerant) stab at Islam (\u201cChildren of a Worthless God,\u201d a title that\u2019s weakly adapted from a much better song by a much better band), not a single lyrical passage proves to be original or enjoyable. And if lyrical \u2018maturity\u2019 wasn\u2019t the ultimate proof of their newfound super seriousness, they\u2019ve even scrapped the ol\u2019 Exodus gang vocals. A blasphemous work indeed, oh Atrocity Exhibition!\n\nBut honesty always prevails in this reviewer\u2019s work, and with that, I must admit that the musical presentation isn\u2019t as unpleasant as the band\u2019s lack of spirit might imply. The overall sound is extremely heavy (as modern productions go) and there\u2019s a surprising amount of fast passages, if not explicitly thrashy ones. The return of Tom Hunting is welcome and bassist Jack Gibson actually gets a good slice in the mix. And remarkably, for the album\u2019s extremely lengthy song format (four songs hovering around the eight minute mark and one cresting the ten), it\u2019s not nearly as much of a drag as it could have been, save some lengthy mid-paced plodding (one of the few Exodus traditions honored here, and a most unfortunate one at that). And Rob Dukes really isn\u2019t the worst guy out there. On the Derrick Green Scale of Shitty Replacement Vocalists, Dukes only measures approximately 0.5 Derrick Greens (where a measurement of 1.0 Derrick Greens is equal to being Derrick Green (the horror!) and a measurement of less than 0.05 is very unlike Derrick Green, the ideal). His clean singing is painful, but that\u2019s limited to \u201cChildren of a Worthless God\u201d and his generic hardcore shout/rasp is at the very least enthusiastic. And again, the solos are worthy and the overall songs are listenable, if not particularly entertaining (save \u201cRiot Act,\u201d if you and your friends are in the mood for a good old-fashioned game of Find the Downbeat). \"Iconoclasm\" might be considered a highlight.\n\nI guess in the end, it\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s an awful Exodus album as it\u2019s an awfully different Exodus album. You know, the kind that divides an older fanbase against a younger one or a seasoned, change-fearing thrasher-type against a more open-minded fan willing to let an old band try out a new sound. In comparison to the bands I\u2019ve mentioned above (that shamelessly suck on the cock of the generic melo-death sound), The Atrocity Exhibition slays and could very well be up your alley, oh purveyor of the new-school. But it\u2019s not for me, and if you revere the Exodus that once was, it probably isn\u2019t for you either.\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a permanent debate amongst Exodus fans over which of their vocalists best led the band on their mission of blunt-force brutality: poseur-slaying madman Paul Baloff or the cynical, vicious Steve \u201cZetro\u201d Souza (Rob Dukes, I believe, has never been in contention). Personally, I\u2019ve always preferred the Zetro albums, being greater in number and packed with more than enough brilliance to compensate for their lesser moments. However, live presentation is an entirely different story and it\u2019s here that Baloff\u2019s Exodus runs the show, which is quite easy to see when we compare the live albums produced by both eras of the band. Zetro\u2019s entry came first with 91\u2019s Good Friendly Violent Fun, recorded at some point of the Fabulous Disaster tour.\n\nAnd to some degree, Good Friendly Violent Fun is a good live album; it\u2019s a solid representation of how this Exodus lineup handled itself in a live situation. The musical performance is spot on, Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt shredding up to par. Particularly impressive is John Tempesta\u2019s drum performance, his Exodus debut. As his participation is less enthusiastic on the later LP Impact is Imminent, I was hoping at best he\u2019d manage to be a bit more spirited in a live setting, wholly unexpecting him to completely fill Tom Hunting\u2019s shoes, which he most certainly does here. Rob McKillop can\u2019t really be heard, but that\u2019s no surprise, and is not necessary for enjoyment of Exodus\u2019 lethal thrash barrage. Everything else is perfectly implemented: the Fabulous Disaster tracks sound rawer and more energetic and the Pleasures of the Flesh tracks sound more aggressive and just generally better than their studio counterparts.\n\nWhich brings us to the principal flaw: the pretty damn weak tracklist. Opener \u201cFabulous Disaster\u201d is an excellent choice and the \u201cToxic Waltz,\u201d though an obvious inclusion, is quite welcome due to its frenetic live pacing. But there\u2019s no \u201cLast Act of Defiance,\u201d no \u201cLike Father, Like Son,\u201d no \u201cPleasures of the Flesh\u201d (in fact, none of the choice songs from that album are here), and no Baloff-era material at all. The fuck? You\u2019re telling me the Souza-led lineup didn\u2019t touch any of that shit? I say good day to you, sir! Instead we\u2019re treated with \u201cBrain Dead,\u201d \u201cCajun Hell,\u201d and another AC/DC cover in the form of their \u2018you had to have been there to appreciate it\u2019 rendition of \u201cDirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\u201d (which they\u2019d end up outdoing in the studio a decade later anyway) Yeah, there\u2019s a chance I might cheer wildly if I was at an Exodus show and they busted this one out, but I\u2019d be guaranteed to lose my shit if they did \u201cImpaler\u201d or \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d instead. And besides, AC/DC is still touring, and I don\u2019t think those blokes will be performing \u201cMetal Command\u201d anytime soon. So anyway, while I wouldn\u2019t necessarily be disappointed by this setlist live, I\u2019m certainly disappointed by it on a live album. Additionally, Zetro\u2019s vocal effort is a let down, as his delivery sounds weary throughout much of this. It\u2019s also a bummer to discover that his speaking voice is not as comically vicious as his \u2018singing\u2019 voice and his stage banter doesn\u2019t live up to his recorded lyrical mastery.\n\nAt the very least, this album would be excellent fan fodder for me and my fellow Zetro loyalists, except that the recent CD re-releases of Pleasures of the Flesh and Fabulous Disaster each contain one half of Good Friendly Violent Fun as bonus tracks, making this particular out-of-print collectible as decidedly obsolete. Do you just have to have the real deal anyway? You tell me.\n",
        "\nA poem:\n\nI won\u2019t play no games wit you pussy niggaz,\nI fuck round pull dat thang on you pussy niggaz,\nI\u2019m too clean to try ta swang wit you pussy niggaz,\nI b-bang b-bang bang on you pussy niggaz.\n\nA review:\n\nSo Exodus, like so many thrash bands today, realized that their glory days are long gone, lost amidst the cutoff sleeve bootleg shirts and whitewashed high top sneakers of ages ago. So as a break from their good-but-not-always-great modern material, they give us this little album: a rerecording of Bonded by Blood. Good news? Bad news? A cash in? A disgrace to the band\u2019s legacy? What to make of it? Certainly, many ventures into reliving older material have failed miserably (take Testament\u2019s shameful First Strike Still Deadly compilation, that Anthrax album that probably gave its listeners Down syndrome), but let\u2019s take into consideration the factors at play here.\n\n1). According to my research, this is an Exodus album. It features original members guitarist Gary Holt and drummer Tom Hunting, as well as somewhat long-time bassist Jack Gibson. The two newest members are Heathen\u2019s own Lee Altus, and controversial new vocalist/scary bearded man Rob Dukes. These musicians perform under the name Exodus and play many songs made famous by Exodus, so I must conclude that Let There be Blood is an Exodus album.\n\n2). For all intents and purposes, this album is Bonded by Blood, the greatest early thrash metal album of all time. The song titles are all the same as that hallowed album and the album art is some sort of modern reimagining of whatever the fuck was going on the original cover. So, through use of my calculus and biotechnology skills, I have determined this album is basically Bonded by Blood, but for a third time.\n\nNow who the FUCK has a problem with this? Pussy niggaz, that\u2019s who. Let\u2019s delve further.\n\nThis album rules, plain and simple. Looking at how the majority of the metal scene has wholeheartedly deemed it unworthy of licking Paul Baloff\u2019s dead scrotum skin, I can\u2019t help be baffled. I went into this album expecting some complete travesty, some sort of Hatebreed-styled chugathon (that\u2019s what newer Exodus sounds like, right? Right?) replete with bro-tastic breakdowns in place of midpaced riffs and throwaway speedy Holt-isms completely besmirching the good name of the album. After all, they already rerecorded the entire album on Another Lesson in Violence, did anybody really need it again? Well, when you get right down to it, yes. Yes, we did.\n\nLet There be Blood is hardly a deviation from the original 1985 album, nor the 1997 live album. All the riffs are still there, just as sharp and jagged as they once were. All the solos are still there, all meedly-meedly-moo like. The drumming is precise and pounding, the bass is low and grinding. Compared to the other versions, I\u2019d liberally estimate that this album is perhaps 5% or 10% slower. Sound bad? NO is the only accepted answer, because Exodus has always been just as good (perhaps even better) at midpaced, groovy riffs than at faster ones. Remember \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d and \u201cDeliver Us to Evil\u201d? Or ANY album they did after 1985? They were all groovy as gravy, so this rerecording sounds quite par for the course for the band. The new versions of \u201cA Lesson in Violence\u201d and \u201cPirhana\u201d are perhaps the most middling tracks here, solely due to the speedy ferocity of the originals compared to the slightly tamed interpretations here. Tom\u2019s drumming on these tracks appear to be the main problem: they don\u2019t quite beat you over the head with his impeccable *bassSNAREbassSNAREbassSNAREbassSNARE* thrash beats we\u2019re all familiar with and expect from these tracks. Instead, they\u2019re a bit more lax and less rushed, allowing more room for the tracks to breathe, even though these are tracks that should NOT have room to breathe; they should be rushed and fast and fearsome and incredibly fucking urgent. This is a FAST EXODUS SONG, so I should be FAST EXODUS STABBING and FAST EXODUS RAPING all throughout the whole thing. No time to waste, Tom!\n\nSo if the faster songs aren\u2019t quite this album\u2019s strong suits, what are? Pretty much all other aspects of it, really. The one-two-three punch of \u201cBonded by Blood,\u201d \u201cExodus\u201d and \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d is brilliant. The songs don\u2019t sound tired or overplayed at all: they\u2019re still vicious, rabid and fucking thrash. The title track hasn\u2019t lost a step since 1985. That iconic riff, played in the perfect tempo to complement Tom\u2019s drumming (fast, but not FAST EXODUS FAST) and then bang bang bang BLOOD UPON THE STAGE. I\u2019ll make note of the guitar solos: they\u2019re spot on! Gary Holt does his thang, but newcomer Lee Altus fares brilliantly as well. I\u2019m not sure exactly how large of a presence previous guitarist Rick Hunolt had on the songwriting process or general personality of Exodus, but Altus is more than welcome to replace the man. Well-versed in Bay Area-isms, Altus doesn\u2019t miss a beat. BLOODY CORPSE MAKES ME FEEL GREAT. Yeah. The ancient \u201cHell\u2019s Breath\u201d has a decrepit NWOBHM feel in the soloing and riffcraft, which certainly benefits from Lee Altus\u2019s Breaking the Silence sound.\n\nI\u2019ll tackle the two greatest complaints leveled against this release: the production, and the singer. I can see how the crunchy, fat, modern guitar tone might put off some veteran thrashers, but the sound works brilliantly over all. I mentioned the general groovy-graviness of Exodus earlier, and this retardedly heavy production benefits the album greatly. It\u2019s reminiscent of a cleaned-up, studio version of the production on Another Lesson in Violence, really. Any cursory listen of that album will clearly demonstrate what can only be the late Paul Baloff\u2019s utmost approval of the production on this album. \u201cWhy do you want to be so heavy?\u201d the pussy niggaz ask. \u201cHehe, why so heavy...\u201d Paul chuckles, brushing off that question because it\u2019s a stupid one. The heavy production does not strip a single riff of its original bite, does not lessen a solo to anything beneath greatness. Songs like \u201cMetal Command\u201d and \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d still make me want to rage uncontrollably like a maniac, so I\u2019m rather confused when fans claim this release lacks the energy and vitality so important to Exodus. I assure you, this album is replete with the thrashing vigor you so rightfully expect of this band. Trust me, I\u2019m TheExodusAttack.\n\nAnd for Rob Dukes? Well according to Youtube, he\u2019s a crazy fat homeless man that Exodus hired as a singer in what must have been a bout of drunken bad decisions. And god damnit, if that doesn\u2019t sound like the most EXODUS thing the band could have done, I don\u2019t know what is. Rob Dukes has a particularly vicious and screechy sound that is perfectly befitting of these songs. Honestly, his vocal performance is pretty damn similar to Baloff\u2019s: enraged in a wild, foolish way, gleefully spewing violent anti-poser rhetoric at the listeners. The phrase \u201chardcore tuff guy\u201d is thrown around a lot when describing him, and although not inaccurate in terms of the way he looks (bald head, tattoo sleeves and that BEARD), he certainly doesn\u2019t sound the part. He sounds like a screechy, raspy thrash metal singer. His method of singing is far more appropriate for Baloff-era songs than Steve Zetro\u2019s ever were, god bless the man. Nothing sounds out of place when Dukes screams \u201cTHEIR BODIES, THEY BURN AND BLEED UNTIL THEY BOW, MY WORDS THEY HEED!\u201d The man channels Baloff in all the right places, it all works out very nicely.\n\nYou know what the best way for me to describe the overall sound of Let There be Blood? It sounds like a live Exodus show. If you\u2019ve seen Exodus play within the last three years and enjoyed it, you will have no reason not to enjoy this rerecording. Those defining solo passages still slice you to the core, the riffs still rape and murder you wife, and the drumming still does something else quoted from Bonded by Blood. Of course, if you haven\u2019t heard that album yet, the original and 1997 live album are of higher priority than this release: I would generally recommend seeing Exodus play live as an alternative to this album. But if that isn\u2019t an option for you, and you want to know what those Bay Area heroes sound like in concert nowadays, I\u2019d wholeheartedly recommend picking this up if you can get it for a cheap deal. The main reason this album is so great is because the original is nigh-perfect, but that doesn\u2019t make this release any worse. Let There be Blood isn\u2019t completely necessary to a thrash collection like the original or Another Lesson in Violence, but the music, production and general enjoyment factor of this release is high. In other words, nearly all the complaints leveled against this album are incorrect: it is worthy.\n\nYa'll niggaz ain't real, ya just some play play...\n",
        "\nSince Rob Dukes has joined Exodus their albums haven't been quite as good as in the past. Shovel Headed Killing Machine was an alright start for Dukes and following that with Exhibit A really wasn't a whole lot better. Let there be Blood was not a great idea by holt considering the fact the tracks were already legendary and having Paul Baloff on vocals is pretty much what helped make them legendary.\n\nThat brings us to Exhibit B. If your an exodus critic then the first thing you will probably realize is most songs on the album run from 6 to 7 minutes each. Most bands that release songs this long make them very drug out and boring. Each song though is unique in its own way and makes the time pass by very quickly. Songs consist of incredible riffs, fast drumming, and some of the best solos out there today. One thing that is very noticable that has improved alot is the production quality. All the songs on the album are produced very cleanly unlike Exhibit A.\n\nThe lyrical content of this album is fuckin sick. All songs are based of Gary Holt's view of what humans are like and the sick creatures that we are. Songs go from serial killers, school shootings, the rape of Nanking, and America's shitty government leaders and economy. The songs open up your mind and make you thing about how brutal of creatures humans really are. \n\nRobs vocals have drastically improved from Exhibit A. It seems with every new album release Robs vocals continue to get better. In SHKM they were way to raspy sounding and with Exhibit A he cleaned them up a bit but they still weren't perfect. With this release he has found his perfect balance of a tad bit of rasp but most of his vocals are really clean and brutal. \n\nOverall this album is a vast improvement from the past view releases from the almighty Exodus. This is definitely a album worth picking up in stores and anyone that has the chance to go see them on tour should go. Don't pass up the chance. Exodus has been Thrashing hard for 30 years and haven't let up a bit. I recommend this album to anyone that is a die hard thrash fan or is just in the mood to head bang and toxic waltz a little bit.\n",
        "\nI surprisingly found this on cd at Buy Best brand new, bought it and immediately listened to the whole through. When the first riff of Bonded by Blood started, I felt a little sorry for my neck for it was about to go through a thrashing unlike it had ever felt before. The rest of the album held me down and penetrated me repetitively, and you know what? I liked it. Any fan of thrash metal cannot help but to enjoy this album start to finish, there is not a bad song on it.\n\nLet us start with the vocals of the great and late Paul Baloff. From the start, you can tell he isn\u2019t the greatest singer, in fact what he does on this album can barely be called singing at all. When I first listened to the album I thought his voice was terrible and could barely enjoy it. It wasn\u2019t until a few times listening that I realized, who cares if he can sing he\u2019s the most metal guy there is. Paul Baloff isn\u2019t a good singer and anyone who says he is can\u2019t be telling the truth but that doesn\u2019t matter on this album because although his voice isn\u2019t pretty the songs aren\u2019t either and his voice suits them very well. \n\nOne downfall to the album is that although the riffs are great there isn\u2019t very many of them. Every song seems to be focused around one or two riffs and doesn\u2019t change much from there. The songs are simple, going through a simple structure and using simple riffs but they are catchy as hell and thrash like no other. The songs on Bonded by Blood can be arranged into three categories, the great, the good, and the average. No song is bad but a couple are pretty average compared to the others. \n\nThe songs No Love and Metal Command are pretty average songs. They are the weakest on the album. The riffing on No love isn\u2019t nearly as good as the rest of the album. The song does not stay in your head as much as the other songs on the album. No Love starts with a acoustic guitar intro which is nice but doesn\u2019t fit in with the rest of the song. It sounds like it should be a separate track but inside got mixed into this song as an intro that does not fit in. Metal Command is equally average as No Love. There isn\u2019t much of a riff on this song that isn\u2019t generic. The solo section and the riff after the solo sound very nice but the rest of the song isn\u2019t anything special. That being said it isn\u2019t a bad song at all but if you\u2019re going to listen to this album it isn\u2019t a necessary part of the experience.\n\nThe majority of the album can be put classified as good songs, not great but still very good. Songs like Piranha, Exodus, And Then There Were None, and Strike Of The Beast are good songs, but not quite the best on the album. These four songs have some great riffage and some great vocals done by Paul Baloff, not to mention the fantastic drumming of Tom Hunting. The biggest problem these songs have is they get repetitive towards the end. They are focused around two or three good riffs that sound good for a while but eventually after a whole song of switching between them, they can get old. The songs thrash as hard as anything and most people won\u2019t even realize that they been listening to two riffs for an entire song but it is happening whether you realize it or not.\n\nThe remaining songs Bonded by Blood, A Lesson In Violence, and Deliver us to Evil are great. They have nearly no flaws. Just like the previous songs the riff count in them is low but you can barely tell because you\u2019re too busy head banging to listen to the songs hard enough to realize. Out of these three songs Deliver us to Evil stands out for it slower tempo. It is the only song on the album that is mid paced and that makes it unique from the rest of the album. Bonded by Blood and A Lesson In Violence are more of the albums style, two extremely good thrash metal songs that start fast and never slow down. Great solos and riffs make them stand above the rest of the songs on the album.\n\nOther than great songs, this album also has almost perfect production. For a debut of a thrash metal band at this time it has a very clean recording quality. The guitars never sound muddy, the drums are clear and coherent, and the vocals aren\u2019t drowned out and they don\u2019t over power everything else. Sometimes the production can take away the power of the songs but not on this album all the punch and crunch the songs were intended to have is still there. You can\u2019t ask for much more from a bands first release.\n\nThis could be the perfect thrash metal album if it weren\u2019t for the repetitive riffing. You can tell Exodus had fun making it and that they didn\u2019t care what anyone thought of it as long as it was metal. They sacrificed nothing from their sound to make this album and it is exactly how they meant it to be. Other than a few repetitive songs the album is nearly perfect from start to finish.\n",
        "\nEver since the CD first came into wide use, bands have been going to great lengths to ensure that the 80 minutes on each disc would be occupied accordingly. Of course, metal has not escaped this trend with bands like Iron Maiden and Metallica readily providing a great deal of material with each release. Exodus seems to have also joined in the trend in recent years with this being their longest album to date. It is also the first album of theirs to get on the Billboard and the first to not feature a single line-up change since 1989's \"Fabulous Disaster.\"\n\nPredictably, not much has changed since \"Exhibit A\" came out in 2007. The guitars continue to go between chunky riffs and upbeat grooves, the drums are packed with intensity, the bass manages to stand out a number of times, and the vocals are largely executed in that hardcore-influenced snarl that still continues to divide listeners everywhere. Fortunately the experimental flourishes that popped up on the previous album are still used to varying effects. Vocalist Rob Dukes in particular adds some dimensions to his approach as several tracks showcase a more restrained delivery and a few slower tracks bring about more melodic touches/effects.\n\nThe songwriting also hasn't changed much as guitarist/bandleader Gary Holt continues to pack his songs with longer durations and elaborate structures, but it is fairly safe to say that no two songs manage to sound alike with the different styles present. In addition to the numerous thrashers that appear on here, you've got a few mid-tempo tracks (\"Nanking,\" \"Democide\"), a few death metal flirtations (\"Downfall,\" \"The Sun Is My Destroyer\"), a pretty upbeat song (\"Hammer And Life\"), and a nifty instrumental towards the end (\"A Perpetual State Of Indifference\"). The thrashers such as \"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\" and \"March Of The Sycophants\" may be some of my favorite tracks on the album, but I do think that most of the other songs are nicely executed. \"Nanking\" and \"Democide\" mange to stand out in particular for their slower tempos and previously mentioned vocal experimentation.\n\nAs expected, the lyrics all seem to deal with a common theme and tend to revolve around the various ways that mankind is slowly killing itself. You've got murder (\"The Ballad of Leonard and Charles,\" \"Beyond The Pale,\" \"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\"), war (\"Downfall,\" \"Nanking,\" \"Democide\"), jabs at celebrities and political figures (\"March of the Sycophants,\" \"Burn, Hollywood, Burn\"), the occult (\"The Sun Is My Destroyer\"), general cynicism (\"Good Riddance\"), and a nice tribute to Paul Baloff in the form of \"Hammer And Life.\" There's nothing really new here but it does fit the musical content...\n\nBut like the album before it, this album's biggest flaw still revolves around its lengths. As many other reviewers have suggested, several songs on here could stand to be shorter and trimmed of some unnecessary content. I feel that \"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\" in particular would've been a classic if a minute or so was chopped off. But oddly enough, I also think there are a few songs on here that should've been made longer. \"Hammer And Life\" in particular could stand to either save its solo section for last or have an extra verse thrown in. In the worst case scenario, a little verse repetition never hurt anybody!\n\nPersonally, I think this is a pretty decent album and place it on equal terms as \"Exhibit A\" in the overall Exodus discography. I think the lovers and haters are both justified in their claims, but the solid songs do manage to satisfy for the most part. Whatever your take on the last few albums, I think we can all agree that a simpler, stripped down approach would be the best way to follow up these ambitions.\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer),\" \"Downfall,\" \"March Of The Sycophants,\" \"Nanking,\" and \"Democide\"\n",
        "\nEven though Lee Altus told me in an interview that this album would show a slightly more melodic side of Exodus, I didn't have my hopes up too high about it. Especially because Exodus has been showing signs of decline ever since the 'Tempo Of The Damned' lineup fell apart. This album's direct predecessor, 'The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A', showed a capable band that seemed bored with its own style, good enough out to still blast out a couple of killer tunes ('Children Of A Worthless God' and the title track), but the material was mainly morose and overlong.\n\nNow, there is 'Exhibit B: The Human Condition'. Upon first sight, you'd think the album would suffer from the same problems as its predecessor: the record is extremely long for a Thrash album (almost 80 minutes if you own the limited edition, slightly under 75 otherwise), the songs themselves are relatively long and Gary Holt - who seems to have an obsession with modern and brutal riffs for the sake of being modern and brutal lately - is still the main songwriter. However, 'Exhibit B' is light years ahead of 'Exhibit A'. I didn't actually realize upon first listen, possibly fueled by the bias developed by previous albums, but this album seems to show an Exodus that is more spontaneous, less focused on being \"en vogue\", more comfortable with the style they're playing and - foremost - better.\n\nSinger Rob Dukes has been a major source of criticism for a majority of Exodus' fan base these last few years and although his stage persona can really irritate me to the point of not being able to enjoy the show any longer, he's not a bad vocalist at all. Okay, he's no Zetro or Paul Baloff, but he's most definitely a singer in the same vein of his illustrous predecessors and he fits Exodus' style very well. In fact, he seems to have improved on this album. It could be a simple productional change of direction, but he is more versatile and powerful on 'Exhibit B' than he's been on the previous two albums. Especially on the verses of the eastern tinged, yet brutal 'Nanking', where he layered a low, clean vocal line on top of his typical raw vocals, he sounds surprisingly good.\n\nWhat Exodus does well on this album - much better than on 'Exhibit A' really - is accompanying the long tracks with shorter bursts of energy. Ironically, it's mainly the shorter tracks that aren't all that impressive though. 'Burn Hollywood Burn' is cool, but 'Hammer And Life', for instance, isn't a bad song at all, but it's a bit plain. And I'm almost positive that I've heard them doing that main riff before, which makes sense, because latter day Exodus hasn't exactly been renowned for the variation of their material. However, the amount of variation on 'Exhibit B' is surprisingly high, which causes the album to remain interesting for most of its 80 minutes.\n\nHighlights include the amazing 'Beyond The Pale', which - at least to me - seemed much shorter than it's actual seven and a half minutes, the aforementioned 'Nanking' and 'The Ballad Of Leonard And Charles', the best \"ballad\" to ever open an album, just check out that killer chorus! The hyper-melodic - at least for Exodus measures - 'Downfall' will probably cause a lot of controversy, but I actually like the song a lot. It's refreshing to hear Exodus like this. The breakdown in the middle of the song isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I have to admit that one of the first things I'd do if I ever become a politician is to make a law that prohibits any breakdowns in Metal songs.\n\nWhile paying attention to all the individual musicians, the first thing I notice that Tom Hunting's drumming is nothing short of spectacular on this album. It really stands out, moreso than on 'Exhibit A' or even 'Tempo Of The Damned'. His double bass work and all those little fills in the faster songs is something a lot of younger musicians should make notes of. Of course Gary Holt and Lee Altus are amazing in both the riffing and the solo department, but honestly, would you have expected any less? More remarkable is that Jack Gibson finally gets the room to prove he is in fact a good bass player. It's not like he solos all over the place, but if you listen to the album, you'll notice he's much more \"there\" than on any of his previous effords with Exodus.\n\nNow, with an album this long, it's tempting to say that it would have been better if fiteen to twenty minutes would have been cut off and although there is certainly some truth in that statement in this case, it's not as bad as I would have expected in the first place. Had I been given the producer's role for this album, which thankfully for the band isn't the case, I would have made some slight changes in the songs. I would definitely have cut off at least two minutes of the middle section to the otherwise awesome 'The Sun Is My Destroyer', possibly a little of the ending as well. In addition, I think 'Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)', though a nice and fierce thrasher, would have been even better if it was about a minute and a half shorter. That doesn't even come close to fifteen minutes though. And I'm impressed by the fact that when 'March Of The Sycophants' appears to drag on too much, Gary Holt comes up with a killer riff that totally injects new energy into the song.\n\nEven for the previous albums, I would have said that you can hear a strong sense of musical craftmanship from the legendary Bay Area band. This time, however, Exodus mixes that with a new found strength and entusiasm in the songwriting department on 'Exhibit B: The Human Condition'. I never really thought the band had totally lost it, because even during their \"down time\", Gary Holt came up with a brilliant song like 'Deathamphetamine' or 'Karma's Messenger', but there's a lot more to enjoy on 'Exhibit B' than just two or three songs that stand out. In fact, I seldom listen to less than the complete album. And I think that if you give this album a chance to grow on you, it won't be any different for you.\n\nWelcome back, Gary Holt. And Lee Altus... I have a gut feeling I have to thank you for bringing him back, considering the genius shown on the new Heathen album 'The Evolution Of Chaos'. Whatever the reason, it's glad to have Exodus back!\n",
        "\nThe fifth and final album released before Exodus' first disbandment is frequently seen as being one of the band's most unusual releases. It features the band going into many different directions with predictably varying degrees of success. This was also the last album to feature drummer John Tempesta as well as the only album to feature Jetboy bassist MIke Butler.\n\nIn terms of both music and style, this album may very well be one of the most confused ever released by a thrash metal band. The songwriting style of the past pops up a lot with several tracks featuring elaborate structures and sometimes excessive choruses, but the album spends a lot of time experimenting with a bunch of different sub-genres. Driving numbers such as \"Thorn In My Side\" and \"When It Rains It Pours\" make up a good chunk of the songs on here but you've also got several mid-tempo tracks (\"Force of Habit,\" \"One Foot In The Grave,\" \"Climb Before the Fall\"), borderline progressive numbers (\"Fuel For The Fire,\" \"Count Your Blessings\"), a Southern flavored tune (\"A Good Day To Die\"), doom metal (\"Architect of Pain\"), and an old school thrasher in the vein of \"Deranged\" (\"Feeding Time At The Zoo\").\n\nAs much as it goes against everything Exodus has stood for, I think \"Architect Of Pain\" is the best song on here and perhaps the greatest Exodus has ever written. The track is full of building riffs, a strong vocal performance, an awe inspiring chorus, and a nice tempo change at the end to keep things interesting. I also have a soft spot for \"Thorn In My Side\" but also enjoy \"Climb Before The Fall\" for its solid grooves and \"When It Rains It Pours\" for its bombarding hooks.\n\nOf course, there are a few tracks that are rather questionable. Like \"Fabulous Disaster\" before it, the cover songs on here stand out in the worst ways possible. They're generally out of place in terms of genre and make even less sense than \"Low Rider!\" A few originals also don't catch on with \"Fuel For The Fire\" taking a little too much time to build its atmosphere and a few groove-oriented tracks sounding rather similar to one another...\n\nAs with any other Exodus album, the lyrics are pretty noteworthy in their extensive topics and mixed feelings. To start things off, forget about the violence that made older Exodus songs as fun as they were. While there are a few songs relating to sadism and war, most of the lyrics touch on personal/realistic issues. Unfortunately the band doesn't go about this the right way and songs such as \"Count Your Blessings\" end up sounding preachy and condescending. Fortunately, there is still some sense of fun on some tunes such as \"When It Rains It Pours\" and the completely ridiculous \"Feeding Time At The Zoo.\"\n\nWith everything else to take into consideration, the band itself manages to do a decent enough job. The guitar playing isn't quite as strong as on past efforts but the bass does manage to stand out more than the last one. Zetro's vocals also manage to be even goofier than before though he does pull out a cool sounding croon during the verses of \"A Good Day To Die.\" If only they could've found a way to use it more often...\n\nAll in all, this album is a strange mixed bag that is rather hard to recommend to old and new listeners alike. I like it enough and there are some cool songs on here, but the more experimental moments do make it an acquired taste. And as \"Architect Of Pain\" plays on my stereo, I can't help but wonder how cool it'd be if Gary Holt got Zetro back and started work on a doom metal project. I can dream, can't I?\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Thorn In My Side,\" \"Me Myself & I,\" \"Climb Before the Fall,\" \"Architect of Pain,\" and \"When It Rains It Pours\"\n",
        "\nNow that they've finished raping their own past with the ill-received Let There Be Blood re-recordings, Exodus have put a lot of work into this 9th studio effort, the sequel to 2007's mediocre offering The Atrocity Exhibition...Exhibit A. There are well over 70 minutes of music here, which makes it the longest studio album by far, but the question is, does it offer enough incentive to carry its bloated weight? Of course it doesn't. If we were to carve off about 40-50 minutes of this experience, we might end up with something bordering on an average effort, at least at the level of a Tempo of the Damned or Impact is Imminent. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. However, the majority of Exhibit B consists of fluff that just don't pack a hard enough to remain imprinted in the conscience of the listener.\n\nI've gone on at length in the past about how I'm not a huge fan of Rob Dukes' vocals, but I will hand it to the man: in some of the songs, he does his best here to really 'fit' the Exodus mold, with a snarling performance that comes closer to the Baloff and Zetro years than either the meek Shovel Headed Kill Machine or the direct predecessor to this album. In others, he sounds like a gelded version of Phil Anselmo. He doesn't have the level of wild abandon that made his two predecessors so valuable, but he also doesn't stink this record up. In fact, nothing really 'stinks it up'. It smells all rosy. It's long, dull, and lacking much in the way of character and compelling riffs, aside from the bare fact of its existence. Sure, what transpires is indeed thrash metal, and you can bang your head to with nothing better to do. But the days of sweating with anticipation until you can next spin \"A Lesson in Violence\" or \"Brain Dead\" are long behind us now. Exhibit B is a product that meets the bare minimum of expectations, but strives at nothing more, except its own, nearly 80 minutes of penis enlargement.\n\nSo where are the good riffs? They tend to occur in the beginning of most songs on this album. And that's that! \"Class Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\", \"March of the Sycophants\" and \"The Sun is My Destroyer\" all feature promising initial guitar onslaughts that become stretched thin and pummeled into oblivion when there is nothing surprising or exciting around any corner ahead of them. Technically the band are on fire, with a solid battering from drummer Tom Hunting and the ever presence, crunch tone of Gary Holt and his latest six-string co-conspirator Lee Altus (ex-Heathen, Angel Witch). \"Downfall\" is perhaps a little too melodic and glorious for Exodus, and in fact it sounds like a melodeath band, until the thrashing of the bridge ensues, much like any other Exodus song in your memory since the first two records. Tracks like \"Hammer and Life\" and \"Nanking\" really just suffer from their excess length. You get about 2-3 minutes of what I'd deem quality, and then a lot of filler that would be better used to rip out a classic in a live set. There are a lot of weak, but not entirely tasteless Panterisms (i.e. very boring, familiar tough guy rock grooves) ridden through the album, but this is not a huge surprise, as they've also appeared on the past few, and the band at least mixes them into the thrashing carapace of the record.\n\nThere are a LOT of songs here. After listening through the album five or six times, I felt no magnetism towards any of them. There are several riffs that, if placed in better compositions, might bring back the level of limited excitement once felt about Fabulous Disaster or Impact is Imminent. But as they stand, I will probably never go back to listen to them, unless I stumble across them at a live gig. And that's all to be said for Exhibition B: The Human Condition. It's a swollen mediocrity, and represents the further kicking of the long dead horse that once won all the county races. In order to prevent midlife crisis after hearing this, please spin Bonded by Blood at maximum volumes, then consume a glass of cold water and your depression pill of choice.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAnd now I can't study for my English Literature exam that's in 5 days because of the fucking whiplash the title track induced.\n\nSo the first track here is pretty fucking awesome. It's in the vein of the groovy Exodus songs ala Shudder to Think, Blacklist, As It Was etc which Gary Holt and the rest of the crew pull off with efficiency. Duke sounds a bit different here, he isn't as wild as in Shovelfuckingheaded Kill Machine or as venomous as in The Awesomeness Exhibition: Exhibit A. In fact he sounds a bit more loose here, almost more melodic and at times he cant match the ferocity of the pummeling riffs at display. But yeah, who gives a fuck when you and all your friends are banging your head and raising hell as the e-lab co-ordinator looks on dumbstruck. The solos come and go, filling your ass with bullet holes and all that jazz but what I find annoying with Holt's solos nowadays is that its hard to distinguish them from one another - the one in this song starts out in a manner similar to the other groovy Exodus songs and after that its still not more interesting than the riff going on behind it. But yeah, this is the better song here and it gets bonus points for getting us banned from the e-lab and giving the lab guy something better to do than go on freemarriage.com\n\nThe second song, which I'm only listening to review this album on MA (I haven't heard the full album yet, not sure if I'll get the time either) has a similar groovy approach but then takes an almost metalcore approach with the melody in the chorus which sounds like something out of an early Killswitch album. And the breakdown that comes in too, which is totally uninteresting. Now there's nothing better than a well executed breakdown but the one in here just makes me go like \"wtf\" as 1.) Unexpected and ruins the flow of the song 2.) It's bland! I don't mind the overly metalcore tendencies of this song since I like some metalcore myself but Exodus can't do this shit, sorry. Still, the riffs are tight, as expected and the guitar work is TOP NOTCH. \n\nI know I'm in the minority but the only bad Exodus album was Force of Habit and even that had a couple quality songs. As far as nu-Exodus goes, judging from these two songs the well is drying out a bit but I'm sure the album will better songs than Downfall and maybe Hammer and Life.\n",
        "\nWell, at first glance, Exhibit B seems over long for a thrash metal album. Once again. Who on earth decided for a lot of old eighties bands it would be good to record lengthy albums with a lot of long songs in the 21st century?!? Maiden are suffering from it, immensely, Metallica idem. Sometimes it feels like it\u2019s up to the Slayers and Kreator of this world to keep the essence of \u2018song\u2019 writing alive. Fortunately this album isn\u2019t only about long songs. Now let\u2019s pick out a few.\n\n\u2018The Ballad Of Leonard And Charles\u2019 might come of as another S.O.D. joke but in fact it\u2019s a 7 minute thrash epic. The lyrical content being extremely suitable for thrash (even more for Macabre obviously, but still). The song is pretty enjoyable, the pace and riffs on the regular verses and chorus that is. The stretched mid paced middle section however is were we get annoyed for the first time. Chugging semi-riffs, godawful bad boy vocals (even some blackish scream after a while, pretty bad) and tapping you finger while waiting for a solo to finally take over. So in fact not quite an epic but a sweet thrasher with an obsolete middle section. A missed opportunity really and I still find Dukes boring as hell.\n\nWe could say the same about \u2018Beyond The Pale\u2019. Half good, half bad. Some decent riffs but this time it\u2019s a pretty bad chorus fucking up the song. A chorus which has more in common with nineties Megadeth making it sound like a Force Of Habit leftover but not a good one. The vocals once again add nothing, I said nothing, to the composition and by now I start thinking and imagining what Zetro would do if he had to come up with vocal lines for this song. Dear me, I miss a vocalist who really adds something to Exodus\u2019 mighty riffs. Talking of Megadeth sounds, check out Lee Altus\u2019 lead (the second one). Sounds more like \u2018Deth than Exodus. Pretty sweet but the wrong atmosphere for me.\n\n\u2018Hammer Of life\u2019, apart from the vocals, is the first song which is decent from start to finish. It has a nice slow feeling to it, mixing \u2018Toxic Waltz\u2018 with the slow Force of Habit approach. But I have to stress, the song is decent, not good. But slow isn\u2019t always easy. \u2018Nanking\u2019 has strong lyrics. But the music just drags on and there are no real melodies or catchy vocal lines to keep this song interesting. Another song being decent from start to finish is the short (?) \u2018Burn, Hollywood, Burn\u2019\n\nTalking about great mid paced riffs and Holt\u2019s brilliance, please listen to the verse of \u2018March Of The Sycophants\u2019. Now this riff could\u2019ve been on any, I stress any, Exodus album and still be a great riff. The fact that the chorus sounds more like Soulfly / Cavalera Conspiracy doesn\u2019t change that. Actually I even like the chorus! In fact \u2018March Of The Sycophants\u2019 is easily the best song on Exhibit B.\n\nI do not know exactly what is wrong with Exodus on this record, apart from the vocals. But it feels like Holt can still magically make great riffs appear but seems to have lost his gift to shape everything into (great) songs. Another example is \u2018Class Dismissed\u2019. Some really brilliant riffs and a nice over all pace. But why on earth does Dukes sounds like Fred Durst trying to sing a Zetro line with Hetfield diction?!? And why do I have to sit through another dull mid pace middle section again just like on the first two songs? Riddle me this\u2026 The \u2018Show no mercy\u2026\u2019 chorus on \u2018Democide\u2019 is an even worse vocal line. And why does he start to half-grunt in horrible nineties Chuck Billy fashion on \u2018The Sun Is My Destroyer\u2019?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t know why I keep bothering with Exodus anymore as long as they have this vocalist but for some reason I do. Maybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to be missing out on new Holt riffs. Exhibit B takes Exodus back to the level of Shovel Headed Kill Machine, making us partially forget the Exhibit A- Let There Be Blood period. But as long as they don\u2019t have a decent vocalist, they will never do credit to their legacy.\n\nExhibit B features enough great riffs and ideas to have led to a great 40 minute Exodus album (with another vocalist). But in this form a lot of uninteresting stuff is happening as well and with Dukes on vocals no song gets that extra touch or dimension. Exodus just don\u2019t come to fruition anymore. Had \u2018The Ballad Of Leonard And Charles\u2019, \u2018Beyond The Pale\u2019 and \u2018Class Dismissed\u2019 be stripped from those tedious mid paced middle sections, they would\u2019ve been a great addition to the list of good Exodus songs. For now only \u2018March Of The Sycophants\u2019 is they only really good song here.\n",
        "\nLike (I hope) many others in the metal world I took to the second coming of EXODUS with a delighted smile; I\u2019d always felt sympathy for these Bay Area thrash monsters getting such a bum rap lo these plentiful years. After all, these were the fellas who created thrash metal pretty much single-handedly, but weren\u2019t able to live up to the stratospheric expectations brought forth by the pop-star ambitions of METALLICA, the drug-fueled insanity of MEGADETH, the Satanic war-faring of SLAYER and the left-field rumblings of ANTHRAX (to name-check those nasty Big Four noise-mongers). Not that they didn\u2019t put out quality albums (they did, of course)\u2026but once a new generation partook in the majesty of \u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d all that eluded them some 20 years before began falling into place and all that was Gary Holt-led became the toast of the town.\n\nWhich leads us to this\u2026\n\nDespite starting in some strange and new territory, at least for these guys, via an acoustic ballad/string interlude, things get right down to riff-heavy, chaotic business. That which has made EXODUS the true shovel-headed kill machine from the 80s to now is in full ignition, the balls-to-the-wall madness of old coupled with the melodic abandon of modern day. This time around, song lengths are extended further than previously before, encompassing successfully counteracting ideas, where melody rubs elbows with causticity like paint strokes on the thrash canvas, say, for example, a less mind-fucky \u201cDivine Intervention\u201d meeting the more monstrous ends of \u201cEnemy of God\u201d. Savage guitar strangulation, pounding percussion abuse, and sinister shrieks let loose torrents of insanity-inducing violence the likes of which only so few bands are able to evoke with such a natural essence and ability. Even the longer song lengths are barely noticeable, at least, on this listener\u2019s end; you get so wrapped up in the overall scheme of things that once the song is near its end you really don\u2019t even notice. This is shown brightest with the likes of \u201cBeyond the Pale\u201d, \u201cClass Dismissed (A Hate Primer)\u201d, and \u201cMarch of the Sycophants\u201d, giving any and all willing to partake more metal than they can swing a denim jacket at.\n\nIn the end EXODUS once again continue to kick ass and take names. It\u2019s a damn shame that these guys didn\u2019t get their just desserts many a year ago, but this just goes to show that good things truly do come for those who wait. Keep it up, guys.\n",
        "\nWell I've read a lot of bad press for this album and I just don't understand why. Now I'm got going to trash people who don't like what I like, that\u2019s just not how I roll as a Burzum fan I read a lot of bad press for music I like, anyway I have to make sure both sides of the story are being heard.\n\nSo, here I go. Exodus is a band that has been plagued by lineup changes and I nearly skipped them for it. I listened to BbB and I loved it, since I knew Baloff (R.I.P.) was only on that album, I figured if I listened to later albums, I would go Paul was better so I'm not going to listen to this, as I'm sure many of you have done if not with Exodus then others. Long story short I eventually got used to all of the Exodus vocalists, and they each have there own strengths.\n\nAs for Rob Dukes I was taken aback by his style, but now I love his voice. He may be even better than Baloff, at least in some ways. It sounds like a little metalcore (bleh) mixed with a later Chuck Schuldiner (YAY!) which gives him a nice mix of clarity and harshness. If you feel like Rob Dukes is the doom of Exodus hang in there, it takes some getting used to but it is worth it when you get used to it.\n\nNow, the album as a whole is way different than past Exodus albums, chiefly because the lyrics aren't as joking and the atmosphere is a lot darker. That doesn't mean that Holt and the gang aren't bringing the scathing political lyrics with the lines about violence. It's in there:\n\nBedlam 1-2-3: \n\"On my command \neverybody run amuck\nslam into everyone\nnever to stop to give a fuck\"\n\nRiot Act:\n\"Smash everything,\nwreck it all with pride\nThe Power of our revolution \nwon't ever be denied.\"\n\nI could go on. The lyrics still have that Exodus 'I don't give a shit' flavor, but are overall more intelligently written, in part to Rob Dukes, ever-bringing in some new things to the band, including that badass beard.\n\nYou may be thinking 'Rob Dukes? Exodus is about Gary Holt!' Well fret not, Gary Holt is still the man and brings the true thrash to this brilliant album. The riffs are generally fairly simple and are generally slower than past Exodus albums, but they have that great mix of thrashing brutality and groove that we come to expect. And if you are a fiend for speed, the solos are still face-melters, and some songs are still break-neck paced like my personal favorite, Children of a Worthless God. The song is just flawless, the sweet riffs with the double bass intro, the anti-religious fanaticism lyrics by Rob Dukes, the dueling solos by Holt and Lee. It is an amazing song.\n\nThe bass isn't as audible as I'd like it, but it is better than most albums. As a bass player I get angry when I can't hear any bass, but it is more present on this album than most Exodus albums even. And the drums are awesome, and so unique for a thrash album. A fine mixture of speed and technicality, not just your essential put-put-tuh-put-put-tuh. Really most of the material is not very typical for a thrash album, but that is probably why I love it so much.\n\nPart of the reason I understand why many people don't like this album is because it is a hard album to dig into because it is very different, like Prometheus by Emperor. But you can't just give these albums a casual listen you have to dig into it. Put on the damn headphones and listen to it! Trust me that if you give it a shot, and then another shot, and perhaps another after that, you will like this album. To ease yourself into it perhaps you could start with just Children... that song just clicks. Give it a shot, I almost didn't.\n\nFor being different in a genre of conformity, Exodus's The Atrocity Exhibition: Exhibit A gets a 75, or a 3 out of five\n",
        "\nWhile some people may place \"Force In Habit\" as the top contender for the undesired title, it seems to be generally accepted that this 1990 effort may be Exodus' weakest album to date. It was also the first album to feature White Zombie/Testament drummer John Tempesta as well the last to have bassist Rob McKillop. Well, at least there aren't any cover songs this time around...\n\nWhile most of their peers at this time found ways to either simplify their sound or make it more complex, Exodus somehow managed to do both at the same time with this album's songwriting. The riffs are generally more simplistic than before and often flirt with slower grooves at times, but the song structures and choruses are even more elaborate than those heard on \"Fabulous Disaster.\" It sometimes helps make a few songs enjoyable but there are about as many times when they seem to lose steam. Fortunately there is still some thrash to be found here and there on songs such as \"Objection Overruled\" and \"Only Death Decides\"...\n\nIn spite of the slowly changing style, the band itself still puts on a decent performance. The bass seems to be in the background a little more but the guitars are nicely played and seem to be heavier than on past efforts. Zetro especially shines on the album and may be delivering one of the best performances of his career. The maniacal laughter that is thrown at the end of some verses is a little random, but his snarls and sneers are quite enjoyable to listen to. Definitely makes the lyrics a little more interesting...\n\nSpeaking of lyrics, the songs on this album predictably pick up where those on \"Fabulous Disaster\" left off. A few of the topics at hand include addiction (\"Impact Is Imminent,\" \"Within The Walls of Chaos,\" \"Heads They Win (Tails You Lose)\"), politics (\"AWOL,\" \"Changing of the Guard\"), thrash (\"The Lunatic Parade,\" \"Thrash Under Pressure\"), good ol' fashioned violence (\"Only Death Decides\"), and a nasty ode in the vein of \"Verbal Razors\" (\"Objection Overruled\"). Unfortunately, the lyrics feel like they were hastily constructed in spite of their great quantity and often come off as juvenile and lacking wit.\n\nIn addition to the weaker lyrics and struggles in experimentation, one of the album's biggest flaws seem to be its derivative moments. There are a few riffs on here that range from familiarity to all-out plaigarism. \"AWOL\" features a riff that seems to have been borrowed from Overkill's \"Nothing To Die For\" and \"Charging Of The Guard\" starts off with a really promising intro until you realize that it's more or less a carbon copy of the \"Fabulous Disaster\" title track's beginning...\n\nI really didn't like this album when I first listened to it, but it has grown on me over time and features some pretty good tracks to balance out some of the filler. I'd recommend checking out some of the faster tracks on here; the band was still working on their mastery of consistently slower tempos...\n\nPros:\n1) Strong guitars and great vocals\n2) Still some thrash to be found\n3) Interesting change in direction\n\nCons:\n1) A few filler tracks\n2) Juvenile lyrics\n3) Derivative moments\n4) Less bass than before\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Impact Is Imminent,\" \"AWOL,\" \"Objection Overruled,\" \"Only Death Decides,\" and \"Thrash Under Pressure\"\n",
        "\nThough Bonded by Blood is historically THE Exodus record to worship, I\u2019ve always felt it was the testament of a band just shy of their full potential. I mean, lose that maniac on vocals and sharpen the axes, so to speak, and the boys could really start to cook. Proof? Pleasures of the Flesh, the first album with Steve \u201cZetro\u201d Souza on vocal duties, while not as resounding a classic as the band\u2019s debut, is a tighter, meaner production that stands at least as tall, if not a few inches above its predecessor.\n\nSouza\u2019s presence is the most obvious improvement over BbB. Though not yet performing at his peak, his distinctive vocals are as much a trademark of the Exodus sound as Holt\u2019s energetic riff attack, the gang vocals, and the dueling leads. He also adds the option of occasional melody, something Baloff was not attuned to, which makes an immeasurable difference for tracks like \u201cSeeds of Hate\u201d and \u201cChemi-Kill.\u201d Not to slight Baloff though, as a lot of the lyrics on this album must still be credited to him and they\u2019re a bit more varied and interesting than his earlier work, though admittedly less violent. \n\nMusically, we find the logical maturation of the raw elements displayed so excellently on Bonded by Blood. The fast tracks are more devastating and the riffs tend to be a bit more atonal/ascalar, as evidenced by the jagged chromatic lines of \u201cDeranged\u201d or the accurately titled \u201cFaster Than You\u2019ll Ever Live to Be.\u201d There\u2019s a greater emphasis on slower passages and mid-paced songs, the latter of which would be their Achilles\u2019 heel as they plunged into the 90\u2019s. But here the songs are more calculated, more memorable, and never feel drawn out or boring. \u201cTil Death Do Us Part\u201d and \u201cBrain Dead\u201d are the kind of instantly moshable material that Exodus does best, while \u201cChemi-Kill\u201d has an interesting clean bit that recurs throughout the song that calls to mind Metal Church\u2019s \u201cMethod to Your Madness.\u201d And the title track, nice fucking riff! That exotic, serpentine series of notes that begins the song proper (and comes back with a vengeance throughout) carries the band through one of the best songs they\u2019ve ever done. Listen to the way the second guitar harmonizes around the main theme, the notes wrapping around one another like a python strangling another fucking python. Goddamn electric. It is sequences like this that make me listen to thrash in the first place (thou doth not choose to listen to thrash metal, thrash makes you listen to thrash metal). \n\nOther improvements include the overall production, which is more even and professional (although it\u2019s sometimes hard to hear the bass drum, see \u201cParasite.\u201d Either Hunting\u2019s playing a weird ass beat or the drum volume should have come up). The guitar solos are also far more memorable than on the debut, the H-team starting to live up to the silly nickname they\u2019ve given themselves. Come back next album though, \u2018cause they\u2019ve really done it there.\n\nAnyway, on the surface, Pleasures of the Flesh surpasses Bonded by Blood in most conceivable ways. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also the first Exodus album to be stricken by dumb ideas, something Bonded had no time for in its manic frenzy. In this case, it\u2019s a bunch of pointless, overly long intro sequences. There\u2019s that long babbling Jack Nicholson sound-alike to start off the album, that shorter, buzzy thing before \u201cParasite,\u201d and nearly a minute of tribal drumming before the title track. All of which serve as nothing more than time wasters between riffs. Even \u201c30 Seconds\u201d (which the CD proves is more like 40 seconds), nice though it is, continually gives the impression that Gary Holt only threw it on the album so that his Mum wouldn\u2019t think all of those classical guitar lessons went to waste in light of all the noisy tomfoolery him and his pals seemed to prefer. The album would have done just as well without these little distractions and I would have less to complain about; a win-win. \n\nIn the end though, I can\u2019t really say I prefer it over BbB. I\u2019ve probably listened to it more over the last five years, but each album has its strengths and weaknesses. If you like one, you\u2019ll probably find the other complementary. \n\nHighlights: \u201cPleasures of the Flesh,\u201d \u201cSeeds of Hate,\u201d \u201cFaster Than You\u2019ll Ever Live to Be\u201d\n",
        "\nBonded by Blood is legendary in thrash circles because it is from the old-guard of thrash albums, back when things like technicality, accessibility, and eclecticism were of little importance in the wake of rampant speed, aggression, and pure musical extremity, not to mention hordes of riffs. It is one of the first true \u201cthrash\u201d albums, having shed enough NWOBHM and speed metal influence to stand on its own as something new and distinct and, with the help of several other key albums from this period, outline the style as a whole. It and its immediate sequels are also among the most widely plagiarized albums among new millennium thrashers, whose attempts to imitate the raging, painfully raw, poseur-hunting anthems pioneered here are pale at best. It is also a load of fun; an ideal album to party to, drink heavily to, piss on your neighbor\u2019s porch and fistfight his dog to. You get the idea. It\u2019s good stuff. \n\nGenerally speaking, this is as no-nonsense as thrash metal gets. Edgy guitars deliver heavy riffs at maximum volume and tempo with furious percussive accompaniment. There\u2019s that ominous intro, and the random classical guitar prelude to \u201cNo Love,\u201d but otherwise it\u2019s all riffs, all the time. It\u2019s a dash primitive, what with a certain sloppiness in the production and delivery, but it\u2019s so chock full of memorable bits that you can\u2019t help but love it anyway. Gary Holt has thrash songwriting down to a winning formula: \u201ctwo parts riffs to no parts bullshit. Solo frequently and serve immediately.\u201d Speed is a key factor, and overt melody is all but excised like the innocent victims so ruthlessly splattered in the lyrics, with the triumphant chorus of \u201cMetal Command\u201d being an unexpected exception. Kind of a holdover from their earlier, less brutal incarnation, it is songs like the title track and \u201cA Lesson in Violence\u201d that really pushed thrash in a more lethal direction, somehow being incredibly anthemic all the while. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you a lesson in violence you won\u2019t soon forget, the pleasure of watching you die is what I will get!\u201d Yeah, you\u2019ll be howling along with that one for sure. \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d goes even further still, singeing the ear hair of anyone within range with its furious riff onslaught.\n\nHowever it is when speed is restrained that Exodus truly reign supreme. \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d and \u201cPiranha\u201d are mid-paced thrash defined, while tracks like \u201cNo Love\u201d and \u201cDeliver Us to Evil\u201d position slower passages more evenly against speedy ones to create more involved compositions. These latter two are the template for the types of songs that would come to dominate during the Souza years. Speaking of individual songs, one random neat thing about the album is that the songs are in a variety of keys: \u201cPiranha\u201d is in G, \u201cMetal Command\u201d is in A, \u201cA Lesson in Violence\u201d is in B, \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d is in F (I think), etc. A little thing, but it might just be one of the reasons these songs are a bit more memorable than your run-of-the-mill, E-til-death bands. Just saying. Other things worth mentioning are the emphasis on gang vocals, which seem like they\u2019re in every song and would come to be a trademark of this band.\n\nBut while it is not uncommon for Bonded by Blood to be heralded as one of the greatest thrash albums ever, I\u2019m usually not too quick to join in the refrain. There\u2019s the certain matter of one Paul Baloff at the mic that dethrones this album in my book. Kicked out of the band shortly after this release for his inability to deliver his lines on time, his shrieking, rabid dog growl is both a perfect vehicle for the lyrical violence and an impediment to the band functioning as a cohesive whole. His vocal energy is contagious in a live setting, but in a studio, bathed with a ridiculous amount of reverb, his efforts are relegated to the weaker end of the spectrum. And with the wit and savagery of Steve Souza right around the corner, Baloff\u2019s performance could easily be forgotten. Additionally, while Rick Hunolt and Gary Holt shred all over this thing, none of the lead guitar moments are particularly memorable either. And while I\u2019m in a wishing mood, I guess I\u2019d prefer a more polished production too. \n\nBut faults aside, Bonded by Blood is still packed with classics and anyone interested in thrash metal should have the opportunity to hear it. It\u2019s not one of my favorites, but most of this site\u2019s reviewers would think me mad for saying so. But I\u2019m saying it anyway, so take it as you will.\n\nMy Picks: \u201cAnd Then There Were None,\u201d \u201cPiranha,\u201d \u201cStrike of the Beast\u201d\n",
        "\nI must honestly preface this review with the following observation: I had not yet found a live DVD from any band in any genre where the performing band seems to get past the multiple cameras rolling by and successfully fights the urge to \u201cpose\u201d and \u201cmake love to the camera.\u201d After all, we all want to be stars, right? Warhol\u2019s 15-minutes of fame, remember? Sure we do.\n\nWell, Exodus doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s taping them; they\u2019re in it to win it, and they damn-well did!\n\nI can honestly say that this Shovel Headed Tour Machine DVD set is so much fun to watch you forget you\u2019re sadly sitting at home and not even close to experiencing the fury and majesty that is the Wacken Fest. You Europeans don\u2019t know how lucky you have it! Then again, maybe you do\u2026enjoy it and never let it die! Anyway, back to the spectacle of Exodus shredding the ever-loving innards of its massive sea of people. Vocalist Rob Dukes slays the crowd with an unpretentious assault not easily found these days. The energy from these guys is absolutely amazing, I can\u2019t stress this enough. Truth be told, and I\u2019ll show my age here, I was exercising my dead weight when I watched this on my stationary bike and hit 20 damn miles before \u201cPiranha\u201d kicked in! My girlfriend, who was literally brought up on Bing Crosby, commented numerous times on the band being fun to watch and the crowd being equally as engaging. We old farts know that when the need surfaces, always look to the elders for perfection and Exodus delivers in every aspect. It is, in every facet, a fun DVD to own and watch again and again. \n\nThe performance is one-hour of a spirited showing that only Tom Hunting and company could offer. I\u2019m so glad to see this band still tearing it up after all of these years. With the wonderful and late Paul Baloff gone too soon from us, and Steve Souza possibly off trying to find his commitment yet again, Dukes aptly takes the reins and doesn\u2019t let up. His vocal style fits the modern thrash band while retaining the early style just enough to straddle that fine line. His energy is also enough to get me tired just watching him!\n\nAs far as camera work for this show, the angles are fun and give fair treatment to EVERY member of the band. I\u2019m tired of watching videos and thinking to myself, \u201cWell, I hear a drummer and a bassist there\u2026so he must be there.\u201d How many years did it take for us to see what Ian Hill really looks like? Everyone is a member on this DVD and the showcasing of each member is welcomed and appreciated. The crowd shots are not gratuitous; much to Duke\u2019s dismay on a couple of occasions the crowd seems to be afraid of a full-on most pit. Obviously the crowd would have all suffered heart failure at the 1986 Slayer show here in Chicago where the entire floor turned into a pit! Still, the fact that I had to go back 24-years to recall something so astounding here in the States says something in itself. The Wacken crowd was into Exodus, throwing up obligatory horns and banging heads against the stage \u201cand metal takes its price\u2026\u201d I stress sincerely that this show is hella fun to watch, my friends. I promise you a good time when you view it.\n\nNow the DVD of bonus material in this set consists of a five-year documentary on the band\u2019s touring. There\u2019s also a massive photo gallery filled with pics, ticket stubs and candid shots as well as promo videos for \u201cNow Thy Death Day Come,\u201d \u201cRiot Act,\u201d and \u201cProblems.\u201d The live footage from select places around the world is a fine plus to the set. There\u2019s also deleted scenes that clock in at over an hour alone consisting of various interviews with the band, including footage of the band bringing out a ringer on stage to embarrass Gary Holt with his Yngwie-like shredding. There\u2019s also the story of a Kirk Hammet-era Exodus being busted for stolen gear, including a little newspaper blurb about their arrests! The anecdotes are fast and furious and are funny and enlightening! For a DVD set to have such an amazing plethora of material covering all eras of its career is money well-spent. Especially cool is Gary Holt speaking candidly about Paul Baloff\u2019s strokes and eventual demise and how they were pretty much the only family Baloff had. Also cool is the early Canadian interview from \u201985 as well as the making of Shovel Headed Kill Machine. It\u2019s certainly a nice trip back in time and a welcome view into the present day and how metal is still very much alive! For the history nerd like me these little anecdotes are invaluable. \n\nThe Exodus set is well worth your interest, time, and money. The band has been slamming around for nearly 30-years and has yet to relent or throw in the towel. Things do get better with age and Exodus proves it in this DVD set. Buy it or have a Toxic Waltz done all over your head! \n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalpsalter.com\n",
        "\nThis is a return album for the old thrash titans Exodus after a decade of silence. They come back with some of their grooviest and catchiest stuff ever. This album proves that a healthy dose of 'groove' in a thrash metal album isn't always bad. The gang are still going strong despite some adding on a little weight and being rusty for a while. \n\nSteve souza's voice can still pack a punch, His best performances on this album is a 'rapping-sequence' on the track 'forward march'. Souza actually raps the lyrics in the \"I got some news for you\" part, Which works surprisingly well and is catchy as hell. 'War is my shepherd' is another example of a track which can please both mainstream and old school thrash metal fans. Gary holt is still a monster he once was. He still produces some of the most intricate and original riffs, His soloing is still top-notch. One listen to the solo of 'Blacklist' will give you an indication of Holt's impressive vision and skill as a guitar-player. \n\nA refreshing change to be found here is the total lack of filler material, The crew are still passionate about their music, This is arguably their second best album of all time. The mid-paced riffs have a lot of crunch, The drumming is solid. The production is perfect. Souza's sometimes annoying vocals are leveled very well with the music in the background unlike 'Impact is imminent'. There is no metalcore injection to be found here as in 'shovel headed killing machine'. The bass is clearly audible, The drums sound tight and there is no 'clicking' to be found. \n\nThere are some outstanding solos on this album, such as the simple yet melodic solos of 'forward march' and 'blacklist' which are memorable and totally fit into the songs. The songs are structured very well. The only complaint i have is the somewhat silly and immature lyrics on tracks like 'blacklist' and 'sealed with a fist'. There is a cover of an ac/dc song which thankfully isn't the 2nd track of the album. An old school exodus song 'Impaler' makes a return. Which sounds better than ever thanks to the productions.\n\nIf you're an exodus fan like me, you will definitely know of the kind of intricate but catchy thrash songs they produce which work as a great soundtrack to go around destroying everything in your path. This will completely satisfy any Exodus fan and any thrash metal fan who is sick of the lackluster releases by the 'Big 4'. There are a few groove-based riffs which will not please the elitists but still there is some strong material here which everyone can like. Buy this album, It's as solid as solid can be.\n",
        "\n'Impact is imminent' is the 4th studio album by legendary thrash metal band exodus. The album can be pretty much summed up by the word 'immaturity'. This is a band writing songs about non-sense, It's all about breaking stuff up and jumping around like maniacs. There are some failed attempts at serious song-writing such as 'A.W.O.L' and there are some mosh-pit pleasers like 'The lunatic parade'. \n\nThe album is pretty silly, The title track begins with the same mid-paced chug riffs and unfitting solo. Zetro's vocals are all over the place as he describes a drunk guy going off the road and hitting a ramp. Yes. That's about as much sense as this album can make. Maybe you'd enjoy this with an absence of coherent thought or common sense. The tracks after the first 2 are classic mid-paced thrash tracks, 'A.W.O.L' is a half decent track where they attempted write other lyrics rather than the usual \"Metal rules!, if you don't agree, you suck\" songs. It's just a band attempting to be serious but just failing to get the point across to the listener. 'The lunatic parade' is similar to 'Toxic waltz' from the previous album but only worse. The lyrics aren't that catchy and the guitar work and drums feel recycled from their earlier albums.\n\nThe biggest problem i have with this album are the mid-paced sections which go nowhere, They just get stuck in a groove and never progress further. There are some fun moments here and there but they're overshadowed by the lack of creativity and vision of this band. The crew is no doubt quite talented, Gary holt is one of the best guitarists of all, But It's not enough to save this half-decent album. \n\nThe production is pretty good, The guitars sound crisp, The drums sound 'impact-ful'. It just gets repetetive very fast and by the time you get to the final track 'Thrash under pressure', Which is arguably an exodus classic, you don't care anymore. There are 3 half-decent tracks on this album worth downloading. Buy this album only if you are die-hard exodus fan who'd be happy just to own a picture of your favorite band sitting in a car.\n",
        "\nThis is Exodus's third effort, The album feels very lacking. To begin with, There are 2 covers in a full-length release, One of which is a joke, The other isn't bad. Like the previous album, There are a few really good songs but the album seems to fall apart very soon after that. \n\nThe opener is a decent track, But does one really need a 40 second spoken intro on all exodus albums?. The previous album had it and it nearly ruined the whole album. Who would want to wait a good minute before they actually hear any kind of music?. Fabulous disaster is a cool title track but the lyrics are really pointless, maybe not as bad as the ones found on 'Impact is imminent' but still pretty bad. Then we have a really pointless cover song 'low rider'. What purpose does it have in an official release album?. The ac/dc cover is pretty good, Souza sounds a bit like the original singer and he does the song justice but the problem is that the track never really fits into the album in the first place.\n\n'Toxic waltz', Old timers reading this should remember it back in the headbanger's ball days, It enjoyed some very good success and it really kicks ass live, The energy translates very well into live performances, makes you want to 'kick your friend in the head and have a ball'. 'Verbal razors' is another good track, Souza does his maniacal singing as usual, Gary holt and crew produce some crushing riffs and drumming is not bad. Overall, These two tracks are pretty much the highlights in the album.\n\nThis was the point in exodus's career when groove metal started replacing the crushing rhythms of old. The sound production feels very groovy and 'digital'. The drum sounds decent but not as destructive as the first album. The album is a bit too long, The lack of good songwriting makes it feel even more mediocre. Gary Holt still produces some very crunchy and original riffs and solos but they just aren't enough to save this album. Steve \"Zetro\" Souza's voice gets annoying after a while, The brain-dead lyrics don't do much help. \n\nThis isn't exodus's worst album, Nor is it their best. If you're a die-hard fan and are able to avoid the half a dozen bad songs on this album and focus on the good ones, Then get this. 'Toxic waltz' is a classic, Much in the same way as 'Whiplash' or 'Overkill'. Download the song and skip the album. If you're looking for a better album by this band, Try 'Bonded by blood' or 'Pleasures of the flesh'.\n",
        "\nSHKM is arguably Exodus's most consistent album since Fabulous disaster. There are no huge ups and huge downs like the ones in 'Tempo of the damned'. The album is pretty solid and consistent through out. Gary holt and company come up with many great songs, proving that they still got it. The most noticeable change here is, Rob Dukes, A new unknown vocalist who just joined Exodus out of nowhere. People have expressed their displeasure at this but I have to Rob Dukes isn't bad at all. Infact, he gets the job done for the most part.\n\nA lot of fans want Steve Souza to come back but to be honest, His time here was up already. He couldn't keep dragging exodus for any longer. In comes dukes, He sounds a bit like Baloff and Zetro when he hits certain notes but he's not quite good as either. His voice is generic, Not unusual among the bands of today. He certainly lacks the edginess of his predecessors. The strongest part about his vocals are that you can actually make out what he's saying pretty well. The song writing is still intact and pretty strong. Gary holt is still going strong, He does an excellent job on this album, There are plenty of vintage 80's exodus riffs and solos to be found. The production is good like 'Tempo of the damned', Maybe a little too good.\n\nThe best tracks on this album are 'Raze' and 'Shovel headed kill machine', They have a 'Metallic' sound about them just like most songs on this album. The drumming is good, They are very good for the most part but nothing too awesome. The lyrics are obviously a little bit immature. Dukes does a solid job for the most part. There are still lots of Intricate, groovy riffs to be found on this album and no really exceptional solos, But they're not that bad either.\n\nThere are a few problems, Most songs have the same speed and structure. Some of them feel a little too long, Rob Dukes is not Hetfield, his vocals can't carry some of the longer songs. It gets repetetive and dull by the 4th track on this album. The lyrics are pointless, The silliness is overwhelming, Rob Dukes adopts a 'tough-guy' vocal style on some of this tracks, Which will make you wonder. \"Is this guy from trivium or some other metalcore band?\". Gary Holt certainly trusts in him, So there must be something good about him. There are lots of groove riffs which some people detest.\n\nOverall, a fun listen, Just don't over-analyze the lyrics and the themes found on this album, They're just silly. For 2005, you can't get much better thrash metal albums, All the 'Big 4' have slowed down, and so did Exodus. But this is still a solid offering.\n",
        "\nThe main criticism that has been thrown to this album is that is \"Mid-paced thrash fodder\" or \"There's no Baloff here\", I can assure you, That is false. Exodus could not have hoped for a better replacement than Steve \"Zetro\" Souza. This might be 'mid-paced' but there's a lot of good songwriting and progress to be found on this one. Which makes up for the shortage of speed. Mostly.\n\nI personally think this is almost as good as 'Bonded By Blood'. The production is great, There are plenty of intricate guitar work to be found on this album, Zetro's vocals are almost as good as Baloff's, Both are similar in many ways. The tracks are not repetitive, Some of them focus on speed while others focus on atmosphere such as 'Till death do us part'. There is no constant loud \"dikka dikka\" blast beats on all the tracks, They are used when needed to be. This album feels much like a more mature version of Bonded by blood. The crazy lyrics are still to be found here, but there is a lot less 'boasting' and more focused on subjects. 'Deranged' is about a guy pretending to be sane in prison, waiting to get out and start killing again, This is another classic exodus song, The solo is excellent, The riffs here are catchy. 'Faster than you'll ever live to be\" is total mayhem, Souza's vocals here work really well, I don't see how Baloff could've done any better. The track keeps getting faster and faster as it gets towards its ends, will certainly make your head and neck sore. \n\n'Seeds of Hate' is arguably the best track on the whole album, Features some intricate and original riffs. Gary Holt is a monster, His guitar work has both intricacy and intensity and loads of it, Souza has a lot less 'maniacal' tone on this song and his tone is a lot more atmospheric. The song has a great solo and speeds up towards the end just like most songs on this album. There are plenty of the vintage exodus style 'group shouting' lyrics to be found here, Just like in bonded by blood. \n\nThere are a few disappointing things about the album, The intro of the first track of this album is just way too long and it makes no sense whatsoever, Some guy speaking. There is a 30 second instrumental track, which has no purpose of being in a full studio album, it would've worked on a demo. The title track is disappointing to be honest. The album starts to drag at the end. Steve souza's vocals can be absolutely irritating at times, Which i guess is his biggest flaw. \n\nOverall, An excellent album, Worth buying, Exodus would slowly go downhill after 'Fabulous Disaster'. They never reached these heights again, If you're a fan of thrash metal and don't mind some mid paced thrash, Get this, This certainly isn't the worst choice you can make.\n",
        "\nBonded by Blood was a milestone in thrash and widely considered as one of the best thrash albums ever recorded. These sorts of albums that really have no room for improvement are best left alone. Exodus however, decided to re-record it anyway claiming it as a tribute to Paul Baloff. Exodus\u2019 sound has changed dramatically over the years and Exodus was faced with the challenge of bringing a slightly different flavor to the original but without tainting the original. Unfortunately Exodus has changed so much in sound that this shares almost nothing that made the original so enjoyable and there is nothing new they added to it that is enjoyable.\n\nFirst of all the production is modern. With how Exodus have been producing their albums over recent years this not surprising, nor is it necessarily a bad thing to have a heavier more modern production. Unfortunately this does not suit the songwriting for Bonded by Blood. The songs are written for a slight NWOBHM flavor like many other thrash albums that were being released in 1983 and 1984, so the heavier, crunchier production does not suit the songwriting. It needs higher tuned guitars playing very fast and catchy rhythms. Let there be Blood is completely devoid of the fast galloping rhythms that helped make the original so great due to the modern, crunchy production.\n\nThe intensity of fast rhythms and wild solos has dropped down a dramatic amount with this re-recording and it just sounds like a band now that is uninspired and just trying too hard to sound a certain way instead of just playing and having fun. One of the most enjoyable things about the original is that Exodus was having fun, and the music sounds real and inspired. There is this sense of uncontrolled wildness that you just want to go crazy when listening to it. All that is lost in Let there be Blood. It just sounds too controlled and lifeless. Piranha, for example was a song with a really fast tempo on the original and made me want to just go crazy; basically thrash. Now the re-recording just goes in one ear and out the other as the tempo is slower and has absolutely zero intensity. My head is not even nodding along to this one.\n\nThe other huge problem is Rob Dukes. Sure he is a problem on just about everything he has done with Exodus but his dry, monotonous, tough-guy shouts is just so unfitting for Bonded by Blood. Paul Baloff was wild, untamed with a very over the top style that was just so fitting. It added to the craziness and catchiness perfectly. Dukes\u2019 part modern hardcore style vocals is just so unsuited for fast, and catchy thrash riffing and with him behind the mic Exodus should continue with their groove sound instead of trying to be thrash again. Another Lesson in Violence is a perfect example of where Dukes fails. The chorus of that song is just so memorable with Baloff\u2019s voice changing pitch and just feeling what he is singing. Dukes sounds like he is almost reading it off a script, as he doesn\u2019t change tone once and continues with those teen-angst shouts.\n\nThis was meant to be a tribute to Paul Baloff but is really no more than a shameless cash grab and should never have been recorded. Forget this and listen to the original. Exodus should be embarrassed and ashamed for shitting on what is one of the greatest albums ever recorded.\n",
        "\nWhen a band starts re-recording their old stuff, it is a good indication of where the band is heading to, I have to admit, The last time i heard anything great from this band was Impact is Imminent and Exodus is one of my favorite bands, They like Testament have been a disappointment for 20 years now. After the departure of Baloff/souza, Rob dukes filled in and the band was never the same again, I never wanted Exodus to sound like this, They were once one of the most original bands in their class but now they're nothing more than a mediocre sounding band with a half decent vocalist.\n\nWhat is this?. Bullet for My Valentine's Tribute to Bonded by blood? or is it Avenged sevenfold?. It certainly sounds nothing like the Exodus i respected. Was there ever a reason to do a re-recording of a trend setting album like Bonded By Blood?. Maybe a band out of ideas trying to sound something like their former selves. The guitar work is clean, The vocals sound good and that's just how most alternative metal albums are these days, The album lacks any kind of intensity which made the original recording good. \n\nFirstly, The tracks are much slower and lack any kind of intensity, Rob Duke's vocals try too hard, The guitar work is pretty decent, The production values are good. Rob sounded best in the Angry Retarded Killing Machine album and that wasn't all that good at all. Rob duke sounds nothing like Baloff, And it made me want to return the album when i heard the slow, metalcore version of the original \"Piranha\". This is nothing more than a band trying to cash in on nostalgic fans and failing BADLY. This might however appeal to angsty little fans who never heard the original bonded by blood by Exodus Or maybe it is for Old Aging metal fans who can't keep up with the pace of Bonded by blood, so the album was recorded at half the speed of the original. Way too Brootal for old people. \n\nThe album is completely devoid of anything that made the original so good, Ignore it and hope Exodus can somehow be reborn again. If you haven't heard bonded by blood yet go buy it and ignore this abomination of a great album.\n",
        "\nOccasionally, fantastic and even genre-breaking artists suffer major recorded missteps; some of these are sudden and unforeseen, others are part of a long progression of poor albums that may span several years. Great metal bands of all sub-genres have, at one time or another (or perhaps almost continuously for the better part of their careers) fallen victim to a bad album or string of records. Think about it: Metallica, Black Sabbath, Megadeth, Napalm Death, Anthrax, Celtic Frost, In Flames, Carcass, Sepultura...heck, and that's just a short list comprised of a few more recognizable names. I prefer to scratch my head over what the heck happened to Katatonia, why Extol slowly decided black metal wasn't their thing anymore, or laughing with a few good friends about the attempted late nineties comeback of a certain unspecified glam metal band named after a particular mammal classified under the order \"Rodentia.\" Come to think of it, it is nearly impossible to find a band who HASN'T suffered this specific pitfall, not taking into account the handful of bands not around long enough to screw up very badly.\n\nWhy am I going on about this? Because Exodus are, or at least were, a great band, who, while not revolutionary in every sense of the word were extremely influential in formulating not only the sound of classic bay area thrash but of metal in general. Kirk Hammett got his start with Exodus, \"Bonded By Blood,\" while arriving a little late on the scene (in LP form, at least...rumor has it that any true metal head worth his denim jacket already had a copy of it on tape long prior to it's \"vinyl incarnation\") was a landmark record with all the elements of that classic thrash sound, and the band was comprised of some great musicians. That being said, \"Force Of Habit\" is an absolutely terrible album.\n\nNow, to be fair, the 1992 incarnation of Exodus has already weathered plenty of storms since the early 80's, and this must be taken into account. The loss of Paul Baloff, the stress associated with being on a major label, the band's admitted drug problems, and the passage of time and musical tastes; all in all, this was not the same Exodus.\n\nFirst and foremost, I am personally of the humble opinion that things REALLY went downhill with the loss of the aforementioned Mr. Baloff, and Steve Sousa is without a doubt the number one reason this album is laughably awful. Sousa's \"delivery\" for lack of better or more civilized terminology, has been described several (hundred) times by myself as being a mixture between a bored, high school science teacher and a middle aged man who has smoked one too many cigarettes. He literally croaks like a frog, and his attempts to sing in tune with the music are cringe-inducing. After hearing this album, a good friend of mine jokingly stated that Exodus had swept the finals in his list of the top ten worst vocal performances of all time, \"placing first, second, and third.\"\n\nMoving on from what is, simply put, an embarrassing aspect to this record, take a look at what Sousa is whining about. Many of these songs are funnier than an eight dollar trip to the movies for the latest comedy film and simply must be read to be believed. The pinnacle of absolute idiocy is the title track, a song chronicling the mental state of a compulsive thief attempting to make the argument that, \"it wasn't me, yeah you know it wasn't me. It must have been someone who looked like me!\" However, my personal favorite being \"When it Rains it Pours,\" with it's tale of an unfortunate individual who has the luck of, well, this band; and I quote:\n\n\"So I'm sittin' in a cell for 48 hours,\nKeepin' company with thieves and drunks;\nI'm free to go but my car's impounded,\nand I'm thinkin' 'bout becoming a monk;\nSo I'm wandering around in a catatonic daze,\nnow barely a shell of a man;\nI look like I live out of a shopping cart,\nand I'm picking up aluminum cans\"\n\nThat's just the vocals.\n\nGary and Rick were known in their eighties heyday for being one of thrash metal's best guitar teams, embodying the genre with a knack for frenetic, fractured leads, and most importantly, fast, grooving riffing that made you bang your head (even against the stage, in some cases) and absolutely assaulted the senses. The riffing on \"Force Of Habit\" would possibly have been tolerable if the band had decided to play more than one riff per song. Literally. Once again, the title track comes to mind immediately. I could be hearing incorrectly here, but it seems like the entire song is one riff. There is simply no variation. The riffs presented here are nearly all mid-paced, plodding affairs that sound as tired and boring as this band that have jumped boldly over the self parody line. Occasionally, a respectable, or dare I say interesting, lead or riff will pop up (\"Me, Myself & I\", \"feeding Time at the Zoo\") and many of the solos are enjoyable, but this is hardly excuses the rest of the records flaccid guitar playing and overly fuzzy production values(yeah, it sounds heavy when blasted through a car speaker, but is still not a great sound in my book).\n\nConcerning the rhythm section, the bass is intelligible, but nothing worth mentioning in terms of playing ability or tone. Drummer John Tempesta is really the only noteworthy musical performer on this record, keeping things solid with some interesting and occasionally fancy stick work.\n\nThere are legitimately a few decent sections of this record, but as a whole it is an ugly abomination that eschews the greatness of the band's classic works. It is the sound of a tired, dirty old band content to rest on their ugly, drug-addled laurels, serving the rest of us with a \"what not to do\" manual for songwriting, as well as providing a viable, inexpensive source of entertainment, at least for those who find brainless lyricism and song writing amusing.\n",
        "\nThis is the ninth full-length studio album from the Bay Area thrash legends, and the third with latest vocalist Rob Dukes. However, this is NOT a 'new' album of material. It's just a re-recording of 'Bonded by Blood'.\n\nI'm going to be frank. I haven't enjoyed the new vocalist on either of the past two albums. And I don't enjoy him here. I don't really want to hear an Exodus record without Zetro or Baloff. In fact, I found the past two albums were lackluster in general. Even further, I haven't really enjoyed this band since 'Impact is Imminent', a long time ago.\n\nSo why would anyone want a remake of a classic like 'Bonded by Blood'? It certainly doesn't need one, so I'm assuming this is just a celebration of sorts of the band's history, yet an attempt to integrate the 'new' in with the old. Unfortunately, this is sub-par in every way to that classic album which tore us a new asshole in 1985, with one possible exception. Dukes isn't particularly to blame here, he still sounds like a metalcore/melodeath singer covering Baloff, but gone are those classic snarls the first two singers were so good at. The main fault is the production, it's just too clean and lacks the raw venom of the original. I mean \"A Lesson in Violence\" is one of my favorite thrash songs ever...yet if I had heard it hear first, I'm not so sure I'd have ever liked it. The musicianship is still tight, the guitar playing in particular is quite good on the solos, the exception I mentioned earlier.\n\nBut enough with the remakes, already. This is a perfect example of why it's not necessary.\n",
        "\nWith the current resurgence of interest in the thrash metal of days past, enter the DVD \"Exodus: Double Live Dynamo\". While the title, and font used on the front cover recall Ted Nugent, this is somewhat puzzling because the Motor City Madman is nowhere to be found. The DVD is set up as two concerts: the first in 1985 at the Dynamo club, and the second from 1997 at the Dynamo open air festival, both in Eindhoven, Holland. This is identical in structure to Toxik's DVD \"Dynamo open air 1988\" \n\nThe first concert, the club date, is excellent. While not TOO dissimilar to what, in years past, would have passed as a bootleg, the mid-eighties camcorder footage, rather than decrease enjoyment, adds that dewy layer of nostalgia and charm. The crowd is going crazy (European fans tend to appreciate American metal bands visiting their countries), and the band performs a tight, energetic and highly entertaining set. Also of interest are the performance of two songs not released on any album, \"Hell's Breath\" and \"Deathrow\", making, by default, this DVD an essential purchase for completists due to that alone. Add to that some pre-show soundcheck footage and a great time is had by all.\n\nSadly, the second concert doesn't quite live up to the first. From 1997, a low year for metal generally speaking, I applaud Exodus for soldiering on and keeping the flame alive. But on that big stage there is no immediate connection to the audience like in the club gig. Plus its hard to tell if the fans are truly appreciating them or on an \"ironic\" level only. Additionally, the sound is a bit weird. We cannot hear Rick Hunolt's guitar at all. We see he is playing but we hear no sound. Maybe the live audience did, but the home audience cannot. Add to that his receding hairline and bad, super-baggy 90's pants, and the fact that he is wearing a big white T-shirt that appears to say \"fuck negativity\", and a pretty picture is not painted.\n\nWhile we can hear Gary Holt's guitar loud and clear, unfortunately, the signature Exodus \"crunch\" is SO low and distorted it just sounds squelchy and burpy and farty and is hard to listen to at times. Plus his short, California-dude hair is more suited to pop-punk than pure Metal. Also, Baloff sprinkling the songs with many \"F=bombs\" and shouting them at the audience seems like a cynical and dare I say lazy way to get the crowd fired up. This approach is noticeably not taken in the 1985 concert. But I will give them the benefit of the doubt because it is said they had just returned to the stage with this lineup after just practicing with it. And it's not terrible, but in comparison with the previous concert, it's just somewhat sad to see how times have changed.\n\nIn conclusion, first concert = awesome. second concert = fans only. While I appreciate that the second concert is present and accounted for on this DVD, and it's perhaps not as bad as I made it sound, I am glad it was included on the DVD rather than not, because the more Exodus, in any form, the better. The total running time on the disc is over three hours, and that is very much appreciated, and I don't wish to sound ungrateful. But the passage of time between the shows and the differences between them are hard not to notice, and it makes for a vivid example of the adage \"times change\". However, great thrash, and great metal is timeless and I applaud Zaentz for releasing this. The percentage score is based on the total package, i.e. sound quality, menus, the fact that it was released at all, value for money, as well as the concerts themselves. But with the new interest in all things 80's and all things metal, I'm sure we can expect to see more DVD's like this in the future. Besides the fact that my wallet will take a beating, I say go forth and thrash!\n",
        "\nExodus's debut album Bonded By Blood was one Hell of an album, and while I haven't reviewed it yet, you can be assured that in my books, it's pretty much the pinnacle of Metal's ballsy, poser-slaughtering, leather-and-spikes aesthetic, leaving no survivors in its blazing trail of unbridled fury across the listener's poor, delicate ears. With such a rip-roaring Metal classic of a debut, what was the band to do to follow it up? Well, it turns out that their game plan iiiiiiissss...to get slower, chunkier, and slightly less coherent. Hooray?\n\nSo here we have a more \"progressive\" Exodus, if that's the right word to use, because I cannot think of any other. This seems to be the logical path for most bands after creating a great album, to branch out and do something \"different,\" so as to not be thriving in their own shadows, and sometimes it works, but most of the time it just provides the public with weaker albums like this one. Pleasures of the Flesh actually gets off to a really, really good start, with \"Deranged,\" being just as good as any of the better stuff on the debut. New vocalist Steve 'Zetro' Souza doesn't sound quite as animalistic as Baloff, possessing more of a traditional Thrash yammer, and he sounds pretty good here, if not a bit unfocused, but we all know the riffs are what we stay for on an Exodus album, and boy do they ever deliver on this song. They just chug and snarl and gallop away, and by the end of this song, I am a happy man.\n\nHowever, you just knew there was going to be a \"however.\" The next song is called \"Til Death Do Us Part,\" and the first thing that strikes you is, what happened to my fast, gut-ripping Exodus attack? Now, I haven't listened to any Exodus albums in full after this one, but...is this normal for them? It isn't a bad song, with some nice riffs, but it lacks the linear, aggressive feel that the debut material had. An alright experiment, but where is my fast Exodus? Well, the next two songs are better, with some heavier, chunkier riffs, but it's with \"Faster Than You'll Ever Live to Be\" that the band kick it up a notch, with riffs that actually seem to be going for your throat again, and man, that title is bad-ass. The title track is weird and experimental, starting out with some tribal sounds and a bird cawing, and then kicking into a ripping, melodic Thrash attack that I quite like, probably the second best song on here.\n\nHowever, then we kick into \"30 Seconds,\" which is stupid and useless, and serves no point at all other than to annoy the listener with this meandering little melody that stops after forty-two seconds. I'm sorry, what? I mean, I at least expect musicians to be able to count. Yergh...oh, fuck it, moving on. \"Seeds of Hate,\" featuring the most annoying hook on the album, is okay, but fairly unmemorable, oddly enough. \"Chemi-Kill\" totally sucks, alternating the Thrash riffs with annoying melodies that just don't seem to work with the song at all, and after that, the last song is okay, but I just cannot get into it after that. Ehh...\n\nSo we have a bit of a mixed bag, with some good songs, but a lot of experimental and less good stuff that I just can't get into. About half of this is fun, headbangable Thrash attacks, and even the rest of the stuff isn't totally unlistenable, so I guess I can't say this was a wasted effort. Certainly no masterpiece, but it's alright.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nI read the reviews of this album which praise it as being perfect thrash, great thrash, aggressive thrash, and I can't even think of this as a thrash album. Three fast tracks out of nine (ten if its the 1999 cd version) does not make a thrash album. But the fact that this is a slow album isn't my problem, its the fact that its boring. Slow tracks can be heavy, aggressive and raw, just as fast tracks can, but Exodus just couldn't manage it on this release.\n\nI guess this is where I kind of gave up on Exodus. We all know that Bonded By Blood is in the top three or four all time best thrash albums, comprising raw aggression and speed, and heaviness coupled with an almost punky attitude. Then came Pleasures Of The Flesh, an album which is very underrated in my opinion, but ruined by a poor production. Then we got Fabulous Disaster, released at a time when thrash was teetering on the brink of imploding, the bubble was about to burst, and it was albums like this that helped that bubble burst.\n\nStarting off the album we do have a great thrash track, The Last Act Of Defiance, followed by another good thrasher, the title track. But then what follows are six, yes six, tracks of nothing more than mediocre, lightweight plodding metal that really does bore the shit out of me - Cajun Hell, Like Father Like Son, Corruption, Verbal Razors - all sub-standard and dull. To top it off, track four, Low Rider, is a cover version and sounds like a TV advert. Its embarrassing.\n\nThe album (the original, not the later release, which has an AC/DC cover as its final track, for fucks sake) closes with a good thrash track but its not enough to save it. This exemplifies how major labels fucked the thrash scene by encouraging bands to slow down, to put cover versions on albums and to generally put material out that would appeal to more people and therefore sell more (it happened to Slayer, Metallica, Testament, Anthrax, Megadeth and many more too).\n\nI will always hold Exodus dear to my heart for releasing Bonded By Blood, but there is very little of theirs post-1987 that I could recommend, and I am still left scratching my head as to how people rate this as a classic.\n\n66% of it is some of the dullest stuff you'll hear.\n",
        "\nWell, it took me some time to get used to this album and instead of concluding that it was completely a waste of a release. I came to the conclusion that it wasn't utter crap. The music combined with the lyrics seemed to have somehow fit into place more so than just listening to the music itself. Their topics didn't really grab my attention it was like I said the music meshed well with the lyrics. Some songs started out sounding good and catchy then again it seems as though the entire album now has a lot of key moments. It seems like you can only catch this release if you listen to the songs and lyrics at the same time. Otherwise you'll come to my first conclusion which was that it was completely worthless.\n\nLong time member Gary Holt was on rhythm and lead guitars as well as Lee Altus. They made some leads that weren't that noteworthy though it wasn't a complete waste. I just thought that they should've put more time into the riffs so that you cannot only differentiate whose lead is whose but to also admire the talent that was exhibited here. I couldn't get myself into those leads really not that they were bad but they just needed to be a better mix between the two lead guitarists. Rob Dukes does a decent job on vocals spewing forth Gary Holt's spiteful lyrics. Not only does he have yelling and screaming but also has some clean vox on one song. He replaced Steve \"Zetro\" Souza who left the band in 2004 and Paul Baloff who passed away in 2002 from a stroke that he endured. The lyrics are actually well put together. The band sings about the death, anti-Christianity, violence, war, etc. \n\nThe guitars are tuned down some plus they didn't give up their thrash roots I don't think on any of their past releases (though I've only heard a little of their previous works). They didn't sell out changing their style of music just to sell records like Metallica did (as an example). Definitely some key moments can be heard here. Though I think that some of their tempos and rhythms didn't really grasp me. The reason is because some of the music didn't seem to fit. Yes a little bit of clean tone guitar work but not much at all really. So their variety within each song was decent but what wasn't decent was that some songs seemed to drag along going nowhere. Some of the solo guitar work was a little bit too much. Both Gary and Lee did a good job on the leads but they weren't completely astonishing. I've only heard this album and \"Impact Is Imminent\" so I can't dive into their complete discography to really compare older or now newer releases. In conclusion, I think that overall this release goes back into what I started out saying: it wasn't utter crap though not the best thrash release that I've heard.\n",
        "\nI didn't much care for \"Fabulous Disaster\" after a while, as it seemed Exodus were losing their edge in favor of acceptability on (E)M(P)TV. I am glad to say that this album proved me wrong when it came out! While they were indeed slowing it down noticeably in the tempo department, the edge and aggression were still there and then some, and the attitude was there in spades. I can't see why some people pan this album simply due to the fact it's not \"Bonded by Blood\" part zillion, and as for the slower riffs, hello! The title track of \"BBB\" had its slower parts, most notably the chorus, so what's the deal with criticizing this album for that element? Let me elaborate on why this was the last really good album Exodus released until they got it back together with \"Tempo of the Damned\".\n\nThe title track kicks things (in the nuts) off with a concentrated and controlled blast of anger focusing in the idiocy of driving drunk a la M.O.D.'s \"Accident Scene\", but more serious and with even better playing. As per usual, the H-Team scatters riff shrapnel every which way with an amazing guitar tone (in fact, this whole album was impeccably produced by them) and their customary amazing lead breaks. This is thrash, but it's controlled speed that comes off as effective since the band is tight, together, and more powerful for it. \n\n\"A.W.O.L.\" is a more mid tempo number, as are the likes of \"Lunatic Parade\" and \"Only Death Decides\", as well as \"Within The Walls of Chaos\" (where Zetro attempts a more melodic vocal approach on the choruses) , but as opposed to seeming stodgy, these tunes bristle with teeth and aggression. \"Only Death Decides\" has some especially nasty lead work, and while \"Lunatic Parade\" does indeed nick the riff from \"March of the S.O.D.\", it does so with deadly intent, and even Rob McKillop gets in on it with a growling bass break at the end of the solo section. \"Objection Overruled\" has some amusing lyrics (Exodus have always been good for some really scathing lyrical fare) and while it is probably the slowest and most melodic song on the album, it still packs a ten ton punch. Listen closely at the end of this one for some hilarious studio bantering between Rick and Gary!\n\nNew boy at the time, John Tempesta, puts in a solid and tasteful drum performance on this album in general, his more grounded style working well with the more groove-oriented elements introduced on this album (more so than on \"Fabulous Disaster\"), and the cracking drum sound really enhances this. Yes, I said \"groove\". Normally I feel that groove and metal are two mutually exclusive things, especially with the surfeit of crappy bands out there using the excuse of being a \"groove-oriented\" band to make up for their lack of creativity and musical ability. In other words, they can't play a solo worth a damn and knock other bands for doing so; Exodus took the groove thing and made it work alongside their usual potent musical chops, melding their thrash mania roots with a more structured approach and still retaining everything that made them special on this album.\n\nThe only issue I have with Exodus on this album (most of the time, in fact) is that their choruses are three times as long as their verses! This is unfortunately a trait they've become known for, and while I find it irritating, I can handle it when an album this good comes down the pike and stuffs its fist down my throat with such authority. Which it did at the time it was released--in fact, I wrote this entire review from memory of this album--and it still stands tall and strong, and proudly in my metal collection. I stand behind this album more or less totally.\n",
        "\nLate 80s - the very first years of the 90s and the last good thrash metal albums that were coming. Most of the historical bands releasing their albums in this period featured some changes if compared to the first years of the 80s. The speed was not that necessary anymore because the groove influence started to play an important role and the structures have become quite technical. Artillery, Overkill, Defiance and Heathen are just few examples of this new wave of doing thrash metal. Probably this new style was a sign of the future decadence of this genre but the bands were able to create very good albums in most of the cases. \n\nExodus is back after one year from Fabulous Disaster and this new album has been called Impact is Imminent. They already featured a perfect production on the last two albums and even this time we\u2019ve more than something to be happy about. First of all, after the introduction to the title track, check the guitars tone. The crunchy, massive and corrosive distortion is the most evident characteristic of this album. The riffs are always fast, numerous like a colony of termites eating our ears away. The tempo is already fast, on up tempo and remains the same all over the track. The vocals here are far more convincing than the ones we will find on the next albums. The childish and scratchy tonality of Souza is unbelievably powerful and nasty. He\u2019s always at the top in inspiration, in change of tonalities and he always gives the right load these tracks deserve.\n\n\u201cA.W.O.L.\u201d is again fast but alternates some more grooving moments. The riffs are always immense and the vocals are just relentless: they keep on shouting without a time to take breathes. \u201cThe Lunatic Parade\u201d is more grooving but extremely catchy and easy to be memorized. The melodies by the guitars will remain in your head for a long time, for sure. \u201cWithin the Walls of Chaos\u201d features a bigger length and the typical thrash metal riffs are often mediated with the groove elements in a crescendo of intensity and dynamism, reaching the climax by the chorus and the guitar solo. The tempo is generally mid-paced but the band manages to keep high the intensity even during these, more risky parts. \u201cObjection Overruled\u201d gives more fuel for the speed restarts and this is a good idea. By the way, it\u2019s good to notice how often the band settles down on faster kinds of mid-paced tempo instead of pointing on the pure, uncontaminated up tempo. Is this a sign for the groove to come?\n\n\u201cOnly Death Decides\u201d is longer but the riffs never get tired of destroying the chords. They are relentless and they put out always incisive and catchy parts. However, at this point I would have some faster parts in order to break a bit the mid-paced intensity of the groove elements. For this present I must wait for the second part of the longer \u201cHeads they Win (Tales you Lose)\u201d and they come with the good guitars solos. We go on with this up tempo till the beginning of the following \u201cChanging the Guard\u201d. Here the lead lines are preponderant during the first part and the guitars play a lot on this alternation of lead to rhythmic. The bass drums restarts are welcome but in few parts we inevitably fall into some more mid-paced sections. Anyway, the fast parts are the most important element on this track and that is good for me. \n\nThe last, short \u201cThrash Under Pressure\u201d is unbelievably fast and brutal. Everything the band didn\u2019t put out in speed on the previous track is concentrated here to annihilate us. The riffs are on stop and go technique but it\u2019s played fast! The refrain is easy to be recognized while the rest is simple and direct. This is a perfect track to end this good album of thrash metal. Impact is Imminent is more than probably the last good album by Exodus. Get it and prepare to bleed out of you ears.\n",
        "\nExodus has always been a somewhat consistent band in the quality of their releases. For each release, I've found the vocals to be fantastic, and the song writing to be great... And then 2005 rolled around. Souza was gone, and Dukes was in. \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\" came and went without much notice. Then came \"The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A\" in all its crap covered glory, and now it has come to this...\n\n\n\"Let There Be Blood\" was recorded as a tribute to Paul Baloff (RIP), although it has done more harm than good. It seems as if a fair number of well known bands have developed a bad habit of re-recording their old songs and Exodus is now one of those bands. \"Bonded By Blood\" is quite possibly the finest album that this group has done, so coming into \"Let There Be Blood\", I knew not to have very high expectations (especially after hearing \"The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A\"). Any bad thoughts I had about this band and album were shattered in the very moment that Dukes' vocals came over the stereo. This wasn't bad. This wasn't terrible.\n\n\nThis was complete and utter shit.\n\n\nEverything that \"Bonded By Blood\" had was definitely not carried over into this record. Why Exodus believed they could pull this off with the way they've been \"progressing\" in recent years, shall forever remain a mystery. The entire band sounds sloppy, which gives the feeling that this was thrown together by a band of autistic kids. The drums should have been left out completely. They're sloppy, poorly done, and there are no flashes of brilliance, or amazing fills. The bass is its usual lumbering, repetitive, single-note self. The guitars are so forgettable, I can't even remember how crappy they were, and then there were the vocals, courtesy of Rob Dukes. The screaming, mallcore, \"I'm having a tantrum because I didn't get my favorite choo-choo train\" vocals. Please finger, click the off button and make the headache stop.\n\n\n\"Shovel Headed Kill Machine\", displayed a sick, but still alive Exodus. \"The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A\" was the moment that Exodus' heart stopped beating. Now, with \"Let There Be Blood\", we're just coming home for the funeral.\n",
        "\nForce of Habit should be analysed in the 90s conception of thrash metal. This album shows heavier groove signs that already came out on the previous Impact Is Imminent. The period was becoming quite tragic for this genre and lots of bands already went downhill in inspiration, violence and speed. Many filled their sound with progressive influences and other ones with the groove virus. Exodus belongs to this last category and this album is the definitive proof of a new style of playing thrash metal. By the way, the Exodus groove is not that excessive or annoying like in several other bands and the dynamism is always quite present even if the riffs and the speed of the previous albums cannot be beaten. \n\nProbably the main problem about this album is the \u201cone way\u201d it is played in most of the parts. The riffs often settle down on the same grooving style and the drumming is on perennial mid-paced beats for the biggest part of the excessively long length here. \u201cThorn on My Side\u201d is already quite long and the tempo changes are not that used. By the way, the riffage is quite dynamic and surely better than the following \u201cMe, Myself and I\u201d that shows a goodish chorus and a better central break with different riffs and different structures. Steve Souza is very good at vocals and he tries to be always nasty, powerful and childish. Well, he achieved the goal and I like his style a lot. The production, as you can imagine, is very good and typical of the beginning of the 90s, in order to give power to the crunchy guitar tone. \n\nThe quite hard and massive guitars work on the riffs is undeniable, but the problem is that often the riffs are always the same and after awhile the risk is to fall into boredom. The title track is more of the same but the middle section is remarkable for the good lead lines and the guitars solos to add atmosphere. \u201cBitch\u201d is a Rolling Stone cover and its presence could be easily thrown away. The structures are, as you can imagine, totally different and the trumpets sound in some parts is just irritating. The catchiness is the main word and that\u2019s normal but I really don\u2019t like this track. \u201cFuel for the Fire\u201d is even longer than the previous songs but shows also the very first fast parts! The bass drums are far faster and the snare is on up tempo. The riffs go back to 1989 and this is perfect to break a bit the monotonous groove tempo. However, don\u2019t expect another \u201cPiranha\u201d because there\u2019s always the mixing of fast to far less impulsive moments. \n\n\u201cOne Foot in the Grave\u201d is utterly slow and groove. The only different section is the one of the guitars solos: the atmosphere is different and the riffs change to sustain a different sound. \u201cCount Your Blessing\u201d is definitely faster and that is perfect. The galloping riffs are once more there to create insanity in my headbanging and bring the listener to life. As always, don\u2019t expect continuing fast parts but surely the structures are more dynamic and aggressive. Here Exodus really demonstrates they can still play hard. \u201cClimb Before the Fall\u201d has the typical stop and go riffs by the guitars and the return to mid-paced, grooving tempo. Actually, as I said before, this kind of groove is quite tolerable for me because it has still the thrash metal distortion along with few other elements. \n\n\u201cArchitect of Pain\u201d is a truly long song with its 11 minutes. The tempo is once again mid-paced with good lead lines parts by the guitars. Well, there\u2019s no variation and this is too heavy to digest. \u201cWhen It Rains It Pours\u201d has a more compact and direct progression but nothing spectacular and at this point I\u2019m turning a bit tired due to the excessive length and the always identical style of tempo and riffs. \u201cGood Day to Die\u201d has a country beginning with more mid-paced riffs and slow beats. The chorus is well-recognizable but\u2026oh my\u2026I\u2019m too tired. \u201cPump It Up\u201d is another useless cover to increase the length and nothing more. Yes, some restarts are faster but stop it\u2026 \n\n\u201cFeeding Time at the Zoo\u201d is the last chapter of this long, long album. After the funny intro, the tempo is finally fast and this shows the Exodus greatness when it comes on the speed. The riffs are fast, dynamic and the band seems far more charged to destroy everything. This last track woke me up immediately thanks to the sheer violence. Thanks! At least there\u2019s something really thrash here! By the way, without joking, this album is not bad at all but it\u2019s too long to feature continuing mid-paced parts and groove riffs. The production is very good but sometimes it\u2019s not enough and I would have preferred a more various album (to notice that I haven\u2019t said \u201cfast\u201d). That could have been enough for me, for example like the huge The Years of Decay album by Overkill that is a perfect example of technical, not that fast, thrash metal.\n",
        "\nExodus, one of the ''big four'' of thrash. What, they're not one of them?! Why? Because Anthrax got the fame for their ''humour'' and introduction of rap into thrash metal. Because Slayer caught the public eye due to their overtly satanic output. Because Mustaine, after being kicked out of Metallica, had ''set the world afire'' so loudly that his band was one of the big four even before he had started out to begin with.Why is this band so overlooked? They were around exactly at the same time as those aforementioned bands, if not earlier. These guys were kicking asses in Frisco while Metallica were still struggling in the Sunset Boulevard of L.A. with the hairspray-filled ''metal'' audience (ever wondered why there's so much smog in L.A?). \n\nFrom what I've understood, the album was delayed for almost a year after it was initially finished. It's easy to make a conclusion that Exodus would've been rightfully regarded as one of ''the big four'' of thrash had this album been released in 1984. (Don't worry, I don't use the term ''big four'' very often. When it's about old-school thrash, I use the term ''big fifty'' or hundred to describe all the good bands of that era).\n\nThe cover artwork is cool, it's that eternal evil vs. good scenario, something world will never cease to wonder about. That's about all I can (or will) say about it, because overanalyzing art is for cynics and fools.\n\nProduction? Solid. While a bit muffled (in the vein of 80's thrash standards), every instrument stands out pretty well and, thank god, you don't have to turn the volume button all the way to the south-east, because this will kick your ass anyway (unlike Testament's ''The Legacy'', god, I can't listen to that album with a ''shuffle playlist'' -option on. Each time their song ends, another one, by some other band, comes out intolerably loud because of the shitty production).\n\nThe pacing on this album is very well though out. Between the fast neckbreakers, we have slow-paced, bouncy punishers, and it adds to the music's variety greatly. I hope they would've included some variety in the songs themselves, too. Sometimes it feels like that those mid-tempo grooves last for the entire song (which for me is a bit too long) and the fast tracks feel like you're continuously driving 30 mph over the speed limit. It's nice to do speeding for a while and show off to your buddies, but you grow tired of it soon. Same applies to the songs here.\n\nThere's no problem about songs themselves. Every one of them is filled with great riffs and drumwork. And that pacing, like I said: when the title track has massacred the entire club, including the bartender, it's time to take a deserved beer and relax with the mid-tempo grooves of ''And Then There Were None'' (see, even the name suits the situation). But then it's time to fight again, with the faster ''A Lesson in Violence'' and the time to relax comes again after those bastards have begun to obey ''The Metal Command''. The enemies are up to you to decide. I like to think them of as emos (yeah, I know, not very original, but still necessary) while listening to this album. Back then Exodus guys probably regarded hair bands as their mortal enemies. There's not much doubt about it actually, there are pretty straightforward capital punishment, they don't hide anything. Not any ''backwards-hidden-satanic-message'' bullshit either.\n\nMost of the solos are a bit reminiscent of Kirk Hammett's work on ''Kill 'em all''. Not surprising, considering Kirk was one of the founding members of Exodus and probably a big influence in the start.\n\nLyrics? Like I said, they're pretty violent, although in a good way. I'm glad to see no trace of any Satanismus here, this is the real thing. Some years later, when grunge hit the spotlight, Kurt ''I-swear-I-don't-have-a-gun'' Cobain obtained the status of a teenage icon with his ''rape and kill me'' lyrics, but this is the real deal. When you're mad, desperate, frustrated and disillusioned, alt-rock says: kill yourself. Thrash says: kill EVERYONE ELSE! See the difference between metal and alt-rock?\n\nI remember one interview where Gary Holt was asked about the meaning of the lyrics for ''Piranha'', probably by those PMRC-buttheads. He said something like: ''why can't we write about piranhas? should we sing of trout, salmon, or tuna fish''?\n\nNeedless to say, the vocal delivery by late Mr. Paul Baloff is amazing. He's certainly not the best singer out there, let alone the best thrash singer, but when it comes down to how well the vocals suit the lyrics, Baloff is the man to pick. What annoys me at times is the excessive amount of reverb in his vocals, although I understand that they were looking for a bit more intimitating approach than usual, to match the powerful lyrics. But at times it makes me feel like that the rest of the band recorded their instruments in the studio proper, while Paul just kicked the vocal booth down and recorded the vocals in a bathroom.\n\nOverall, we have a very solid, classic release here, although I must say that in my book this is not Exodus' best album. Songs are awesome, there are some flaws in the pacing and in the production, but overall, a classic of early Bay area -thrash. If you wanna get a good taste of how the REAL pioneers of thrash metal sounded like, put this on your shopping cart.\n",
        "\nExodus had a lot of pressure upon them while making this EP. Their first studio recording in almost 12 years with the weight of expectations of a million fans upon their soldiers, the one thing the band did not want was too to bow down to this great pressure\u2026 and they didn\u2019t. Now the review. This EP contains 4 tracks and since there are such a small amount of tracks I would like to give a small track-by-track review. \n\nI have been a fan of this band for quite a long time and the one thing that never clicked with me were the mediocre or average vocals but Steve burst forth with such power that he was about to change this setback as well. \n\nThe first track on here is \u201cWar Is My Shepherd\u201d and is my favorite track not only here but also the album (Tempo Of The Damned) on which it later appeared. Steve at his renewed best and the guitars being shredded their life out off. This track is one of Exodus\u2019 finest creations and even though Holt and Unholt do a great job Steve is the hero here with his brutal vocals performance. The chorus which is \u201cWar\u2026.War\u2026War.. War is my shepherd\u201d is Steve at his aggressive best. \n\nThe next track is \u201cSealed With A Fist\u201d and is another great track on the album and is classic Exodus which has an intro which sounds remotely of Metallica\u2019s track \u201cNo Remorse\u201d of their debut album ) Kill \u2018Em All). Good riffs and solo and overall quite a good track.\n\nThe next track is \u201cImpaler\u201d and is one of Exodus\u2019 oldest songs and the track even mentions Kirk Hammet as its creators. This can be seen as soon as one hears the intro that sounds just like the intro of \u201cSeek And Destroy\u201d at a faster tempo. The tempo of the track increases throughout the track and ends with a barrage of dual guitar solos.\n\nThe last track is a fun cover of AC/DC\u2019s track Dirty Deeds Done Dirt cheap. The band never sounds like the creators of this track (who had this definitive sound which set them apart from the others) throughout the track except perhaps the chorus.\n\nLastly, the production. It is as crisp and good as it gets.\n\nThis EP is nothing short of a modern thrash marvel. If you love not only Exodus but modern thrash as a whole then get EP as soon as fuckin\u2019 possible. It\u2019s a shame that this EP was limited to only 500 copies. Tons of people would have loved to get their hands on this.\n",
        "\nWhereas \u2018Bonded By blood\u2019 consisted of high quality yet straight-forward simple-riff-based early thrash metal and \u2018Pleasures of the Flesh\u2019 was a transitional album on which Gary Holt and the crew were riff wise and compositionally defining their own style while blending in Ex-Legacy vocalist Steve Souza, their best was still to come with \u2018Fabulous Disaster\u2019. A lot of people still consider \u2018Bonded\u2019 the ultimate Exodus album but I have always disagreed. Nothing beats Fabulous Disaster!\n\nGuitarists Holt & Hunolt are really at their peak here, delivering one brilliant riff after another and constantly interacting in the most creative thrashing ways possible. The manage to even incorporate some groovy riffs but because of the arrangements and drums it still sounds like thrash. This is quite an achievement. The title track \u2018Fabulous Disaster\u2019 and \u2018Verbal Razors\u2019 for example really stand out here and can be considered the best two songs on the album and even in their entire career. \n\nWith a song like the mid paced classic \u2018Toxic Waltz\u2019, built around a catchy main riff and ditto catchy vocal lines, the band paid tribute to the pit, even resulting in an excellent music video. \u2018Cajun Hell\u2019 incorporates other influences than metal as well and together with the happy cover \u2018Low Rider\u2019 giving the album an extra dimension of musical fun and preventing it from getting too one-dimensional or monotone.\n\nThe production is tip top. Being transparent and aggressive at the same time but never too heavy (thrash has got to have sharp guitars, not heavy ones!). The sound feels alive and breaths. There\u2019s no technical mumbo jumbo here to make up for shortcomings. You hear the band as it is. In your face and honest. \n\nAs said the guitars sound sharp, clear, ripping and fortunately in those days down tuning thrash metal too much was still considered lame. Just from E to D# at most but never go below D or you will sound sludgy and you\u2019ll be shaving your head and growing a small beard soon. On this album Exodus understood that. Sharp guitars, lots of hair banging around the place, fast drums and sneakers but still with some technically impressive song writing.\n\nTom Hunting does a more than excellent job, drumming all these riffs and changes together into songs. Zetro is on a roll here as well. And his intentions just ooze out of your speakers and he sounds way more convincing here than on Pleasures Of The Flesh. Bassist McKillop however is hardly present in the mix but who cares really since bass guitar has never been that important on Exodus studio albums except for gluing the sound. \n\nThe lyrics vary from good to generic and the worst part is the album cover. So for that 2 points less. Still remaining 98 points for one of the greatest thrash metal albums from the eighties!\n",
        "\nAs it stands, Exodus is pretty much my favorite thrash metal band to date, and this album is all to blame. With razor-sharp and wickedly aggressive guitar riffs, gut busting drumming, and the legend that is Paul mother-fucking Ballof, this album pretty much destroys every other thrash classic. Kill 'Em All? Reign in Blood? Among the Living? Get the fuck outta here!\n\nFirst off, Paul Ballof has some of the most unique vocals I've ever heard. He delivers a superb performance, but I wish the reverb sound on his vocals wasn't so high. But hey, that's 80's thrash for ya, so I'm not complaining. He can still wail like a banshee and it sounds beautiful.\n\nNext up, the guitars. The riffs are amazingly intense. With high distortion, the duo unleashes both fast, furious riffing as well as some slower, ballsier riffs, such as in And Then There Were None. The solos are godly. They're not breathtakingly technical or anything, but they're fast as fuck and almost too loud. For example, on Piranha, the song is pounding along and when the first solo kicks in, I thought my ears were gonna bleed (in a good way).\n\nBass. I don't know. Seriously, I don't listen for it, so I don't really care.\n\nAnd finally, the drums. Most of the songs are augmented by the traditional off-beat drum style usually associated with thrash metal. They're quick and in your face and they're not too loud or too quiet which is often a problem. Tom Hunting has some chops, there's no denying that.\n\nThis album is just full of awesome tracks. \"All killer and no filler\" as they say. I won't go into much detail about them, but some of the real highlights are Bonded by Blood, Exodus, And Then There Were None, A Lesson in Violence, Metal Command, Piranha, No Love, Deliver Us to Evil, and Strike of the Beast.\n\n...shit, that's the whole album. Well fuck, it's just that good! I was listening through thinking \"Well, this riff doesn't feel like I'm being raped by a tree branch, so I'll leave that one out\", but then some other badass riff is introduced or the most vicious solo on the album so far kicks in and it's like, god damn, this song is amazing, too!\n\nI feel like I haven't said ANYTHING about this album other than that it's abso-fucking-lutely amazing. But really, what is wrong with this album? The vocal performance is quite varied and intelligent, unlike a lot of thrash. It's not brilliant, but it's more than just screaming the whole way through. The guitars are simply godly and the drumming is technical and solid. The only thing keeping this from a 100% rating is the production value. It kills me that it doesn't get better than this, because I think this would be my favorite album ever if the quality wasn't so lacking. It's not so bad that you can't enjoy it, but it's definitely the weakest part of the entire album by far.\n\nNeedless to say, buy this. Even if you hate thrash, or metal, or music in general. Buy this or kill yourself.\n",
        "\nWe cannot live with the \u201cifs\u201d or \u201cbuts\u201d, but can you imagine if this album had been released in 1983 or 1984? Already in 1985, it was welcome as one of the milestones in the very first wave of thrash metal in the first magic period but it was scheduled to be released at least one year before if Kirk Hammett hadn\u2019t gone to Metallica, depriving the band of a great guitarist that later would have been replaced by Rick Hunolt. \nAnyway, the year 1985 was not so bad to release the debut because it was a year of a small relax before the magic 1986. The debuts of Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer were out and the follows up were just released or about to be on this year. Let\u2019s think to \u201cHell Awaits\u201d or the Megadeth\u2019s debut and, on the other hand, we had a step further with Possessed\u2019s \u201cSeven Churches\u201d.\n\nExodus didn\u2019t care about this being ready to emerge with lots of great songs and a classic album. The title track, with a small intro, is pure thrash metal up tempo with fast palm muting riffs and schizophrenic vocals. Exactly these vocals by Paul Baloff were the Exodus trademark, being one of the most important characteristics in their fast sound. The axe men\u2019s work is awesome and restless in destroying anything on their way with raw, incisive and powerful riffs and angry, violent solos.\n\n\u201cExodus\u201d is the hymn for any old school thrash metal fan. Here the band is pure energy through fast tempos and the solos that run after each other in a crescendo of intensity and impact. It\u2019s awesome to hear how each riff is definitely catchy even if it\u2019s played under the mid paced influence like in \u201cAnd There Were None\u201d. The simplicity of that riff and the chorus cannot be forgotten because you can remember them very well from the first listening, as the sudden speed restart with lots of solos. \n\n\u201cA Lesson In Violence\u201d is all about the title. Here Exodus, once again, take no prisoners thanks to a song that could simply be considered one of the most violent ones in their entire career. The poor production doesn\u2019t help the impact very much, being quite essential, but the group on its side, joins together all their strength and passion for this genre to create some bombastic frontal assaults as the following \u201cMetal Command\u201d (very speed metal oriented on the refrain) and the trashtacular \u201cPiranha\u201d. This last one is truly awesome and none can be indifferent in front of its unmistakable, galloping, schizophrenic guitars riff. \n\nSurprisingly \u201cNo Love\u201d features an acoustic guitars intro to end in a massive, destructive mid paced riff that will lead the entire song \u2018till the fast part in the middle that marks quite melodic solos too and more impulsive riffs. \u201cDeliver Us To Evil\u201d is mostly mid paced but with a thrash load inside that can easily destroy the most violent black metal song ever, and what can be said for the last, total impact song that brings the name of \u201cStrike of The Beast\u201d? This is pure energy to bang and mosh in a live gig or in your room.\n\nIt\u2019s useless to remark that anyone should own this album, because listening to it once or twice is not enough to me. This is one of he purest examples of how a thrash metal album should sound back in the 80s and it\u2019s the classic supremacy demonstration by a band that unfortunately put out only one masterpiece in their unlucky career. Thrash on.\n",
        "\nAfter the amazing and lethal Bonded By Blood, Exodus eventually had to make a follow up to their classic thrashter-piece. Thye worked on a demo which had the pissed off Paul Baloff on vocals, so it looked as though they wer going to come out with a Bonded By Blood part II. However, something went wrong. Paul left the band for whatever reason so they had to find a new singer. Thus, they had found one in former Testament (then known as Legacy) singer, Steve Setro. While he does not have the attitude and balls of Baloff, Setro is overall a better singer than him. He has more vocal range and control than Baloff. However, with Setro on vocals, we all knew that this album was not going to be a Bonded By Blood part II, and it isn't. \n\nIt has production that is almost similar to Bonded, but the sound is different, and that doesn't sound too good. The riffs aren't as good, and the drumming isn't as lethal either. However, it does have one thing over BBB, and that things cathciness. This album is generally catchier than BBB, though not quite as catchy and fun as the mighty Fabulous Diasaster that would come two years later. So this album is kind of stuck in between the two albums, and sounds a little like both albums, though lacks the abilty that both albums have. \n\nFear not though, this album is still pretty damn good, and it kicks ass at times as well. The best songs on here surprisingly have to be Chemi-Kill and the ultra-catchy Brain Dead. The latter track has a nice fun riff that carries the song through, and almost sounds like a proto-type Toxic Waltz. This song could've been a hit, especially for 1987 when thrash was just starting to get mainstream attention. It's fun, it's catchy, and the riffs and solo kick ass. Seeds of Hate is also pretty fucking aweosme as well, tohugh probably would've sounded better with Baloff on vocals. It wouldn't have sounded too out of place on Bonded By Blood as it's fast with good ass riffs.\n\nAbout the only problem I have with this album is that some of the songs do end up sounding a little alike. We get one good riff here, change it around a little and throw it in a different song, rinse, wash, repeat. For example, Deranged, Parasite, Faster Than You'll Ever Live To Be, and Choose Your Weapon all are good fast songs with good riffs, but they kinda get repetative which causes the listener to get bored after a while. This is also why this album is not worthy of a 90, or even an 88%. If it weren't for the absolute highlight, Brain Dead, it would've gtten a much lower rating. \n\nThis is actually the worst out of Exodus's first five albums. Hell, I even liked Force of Habit better than this. Knowing that though, it's still pretty damn good. It's just stuck in between two classic albums in the form of Bonded By Blood and Fabulous Disasater. It's good though. All five albums are worth owning, and this album is actually better than the majority of Testament's material, and that's saying something. Get this if you happen to find it in your local music store.\n",
        "\nExodus has once again succeeded in releasing an album which is quite controversial. Yet, this time it's not the cover art or the lyrics which have provoked people, it's the actual songs. 'The Atrocity Exhibition - Exhibit A' contains heavy, mostly lengthy modern Thrash songs and either the length of the songs, how modern they are or both has insulted many longtime fans. Many people claim that the band on this album just isn't Exodus anymore and although there is some truth in that statement, I think we have to keep in mind that Exodus will always be a reflection of Gary Holt's feelings and influences, rather than a band that will desperately stick to the niche they carved for themselves in the eighties.\n\nWith that in mind, Gary Holt must have been heavily influenced by Machine Head's most recent offering; long songs with many changes, guitar solos and a long time to build up. But while I considered 'The Blackening' from Machine Head one of 2007's greatest albums, 'The Atrocity Exhibition' is pretty much a hit-and-miss affair. While the long songs on 'The Blackening' mostly make sense to me, those on 'The Atrocity Exhibition' sometimes have the tendency to drag on too long. Something which actually occurred to me when I saw the band live recently. A song like 'Funeral Hymn' is just long enough on the album, it's actually a good song, but when hearing it live, it bored the hell out of me and I even hurt my jaws sighing. I don't know why.\n\nThat doesn't mean all the songs on here are utter crap. 'Children Of A Worthless God' can easily be measured with the better Exodus-epics. It wasn't much of a surprise to me that Lee Altus co-wrote this song. The guitarist who also plays in Heathen is easily the best songwriter in the Bay Area scene, as previously portrayed on Heathen's brilliant albums. There are some great riffs, melodies and solos in this song. Rob Dukes even does a great, Zetro-ish, clean vocal line in the chorus. Damn, I miss Zetro. The point with this song is: even though it's eight and a half minutes, it feels like a lot less than - for instance - the three and a half from opening track 'Riot Act', probably the worst opening track Exodus has done so far.\n\nAlso great is the longest track of the album. 'The Atrocity Exhibition' is over ten minutes, but succeeds in remaining interesting all throughout the length of the song. The song features Gary Holt experimenting with dissonant chords and he does so quite successfully if you ask me. It's a relentless modern Thrash song which shows why we should be happy that Tom Hunting has returned to the band. I have nothing against Paul Bostaph, who did a sufficient job on 'Shovel Headed Kill Machine', but Exodus just needs Tom Hunting's drumming. And he is in optima forma in the title track. A lot of shifts and changes in the song, each being more vicious and merciless than the previous. And while Lee Altus mainly does the better solos on this album, Gary Holt's solo on this track is pure gold. It has a somewhat bluesy feel, which goes really well with the Sabbath-ish riff backing it. Lee's solo of course kicks ass too, but the riff backing it is the real neck-snapper here. I guess the difference between this song and the other long songs on this album, is that the changes in this one are a lot less predictable than the ones in, let's say, the horribly mind-numbing 'Iconoclasm'.\n\nApart from these two killer tracks, the album is an extreme case of hanging in the balance. There's a lot of that downtuned, 21st century Thrash, like 'As It Was, As It Soon Shall Be', which is a failed attempt to copy 'Blacklist' off of 'Tempo Of The Damned' to me. 'The Garden Of Bleeding' is incredibly uninspired as well. On the other hand, 'Bedlam 1-2-3' is an awesome closer. Especially that slow, creeping intro is amazing, but when the song speeds up (big-time!) it kills everything around you. And you might be pleasantly surprised by the hidden bonus track. I'm not going to ruin that secret for you.\n\nIt's not all crap, there are actually moments when you still can hear that Gary Holt was once the king of Thrash riffs, but overall, this album is a bit too pretentious for it's own good. It's definitely the worst thing Exodus has done since 'Force Of Habit', but some of the ratings this album has been given suggest that it's a piece of shit written and played by untalented musicians and that is of course not true. There are great songs on this album, but if Gary Holt wants to continue following this path, I suggest he puts on 'The Blackening' once more and tries to figure out what was REALLY the secret that made that album so interesting.\n\nOh and by the way, Gary, I know you probably don't want to, but: GET...ZETRO...BACK!\n",
        "\nHell Yeah, this is pure thrash metal from 1990, that's for sure. Is it dated? It sure is, but does it still kick ass? Absolutely. \n\nWhereas the Fabulous Disaster album was a bit on the experimental and quirky side, this album is a more refined, more finely tuned thrasher with some real nice qualities about it. Firstly i'd like to talk about how it sounds. The guitar sounds hellaciously crispy and crunchy yet at the same time ultra clean. This particular sound works very well for thrash riffs that are precise and very power-chord chugg oriented; after all not everything needs to sound like a raw chainsaw in order to grab you by the balls. I find this ultra clean type guitar sound to be terrifically in your face and works for Exodus riffs better than any other sound.\n\nAnother asset that makes this a great thrasher is the attitude and delivery of none other than Steve \"Zetro\" Souza. Now, much has been documented about how Steve's nasally and mid-ranged style vocals are of the love em' or hate em' variety and that Paul Baloff was the man etc. etc. But one of the main ingredients that made former Exodus frontman Paul Baloff (R.I.P.) the quintessential thrash frontman, was his large as death attitude. Attitude is something that Zetro displays a lot of on this album. \n\nAs a long time listener of Exodus, I occasionally revisit all the eras of the band and I have to say that on 1987's Pleasures Of The Flesh album, it seems like new vocalist Zetro had too huge of shoes to fill in by replacing the much adored, ultra violent Paul Baloff and it was obvious that Zetro Souza was not Paul Baloff and it took him another album after that point and 3 years later to really develop himself and let his attitude become more apparent; and on this album he snarls, laughs hideously, mocks, judges, growls, and berrates the sheepish with his pandering of all things thrash attitude with a capital A and T respectively. While he's not even nearly as pissed off and brutal as Paul was on 1985's Bonded By Blood debut, he really seems to have come into his own on this album.\n\nThe songs themselves are a bit on the long side at times and the album is nearly at the hour mark, but what's great is that the songs don't feel very repetative and boring. This must be mainly in part to the much applauded guitar team of Gary Holt and Rick Hunholt AKA the H-Team. While there are no experimental salsa or acoustic passages to be found here, you will occasionally hear a maiden-esque dual guitar harmony part as on a track like Chainging Of The Guard, and many stop and go riffs and just some more thrashly things that only a guitar duo can get away. The solos make nice use of the whammy bar and oscillating freqencies to fry up your brain while it's banging. The debut of drummer Joey Tempesta, who replaced long time Exodus skin basher Tom Hunting, shows that his skills are more than adequate here and he even finds his own place in the mix which is mostly dominated by rhythm guitars. \n\nOverall I feel this album is just plain good thrash metal and can and certainly should be appreciated by fans of Exodus and thrash metal in general. It's not going to surprise you with anything groundbreaking but it's a certifiable riff-fest with great crunchy guitars and lots and lots of attitude and that's what thrash is all about, at least to me. It's kind of strange to look back now and compare Exodus circa 1990 to the Exodus of 2008 and find that Gary Holt is the only member who remains out of the 5 piece band that performed on this album. Even though they were having lineup changes back then that have continued until the present day, this album is unmistakingly 100% Exodus attack.\n",
        "\nYou know, you\u2019ve gotta be careful when you start treading around (and upon) the Classics. You know, the ones with the capital C at the beginning of the word. You don\u2019t just blow into a film studies class and start taking potshots at The Godfather, you don\u2019t get on your soapbox and stand in front of a painting by Monet. Some shit, you just don\u2019t do. The attitude is similar when you get into the realms of popular music, including everybody\u2019s most favouritest irascible misanthrope heavy metal. Obviously Bonded by Blood lacks the artistic merit of say, Petrarch\u2019s sonnets, but there is something to be said for treating the old girl with respect if not reverence. The appreciation of art is subjective, yes, but it is also to some degree objective. It\u2019s when you get to something like Bonded by Blood, which is both objectively hard to take seriously and objectively one of the holiest grails of thrash that problems often set in.\n\nObjectively for instance, Paul Baloff can\u2019t sing worth a goddamn. Subjectively, I find it a very lovely thing that he\u2019s a frothing maniac at the mic. Best thing about the album in fact. I\u2019ve heard him described as being a hardcore vocalist, and in abstract, this is true. Like the most successful hardcore \u2018singers\u2019 he has attitude for miles, throwing himself into every line and leaving vocal technique a steaming carcass on the side of the highway for the less-than-true vultures to worry at. It\u2019s really no wonder the poor fuck died of a stroke, because I can imagine him popping the blood vessels in his eyes after each take. I say he\u2019s hardcore in abstract, because in a literal sense he doesn\u2019t sound like one at all; there\u2019s absolutely no way a Proper Hardcore Punk vocalist like Henry Rollins would have the balls to sound this ridiculous. Baloff wanders in and out of key like a vocal version of Kerry King\u2019s solos, randomly squeaking and cawing without much regard for his surroundings. It\u2019s so metal you half expect him to vomit up a bullet belt or one of Blackie Lawless\u2019 buzzsaw codpieces in mid-sentence. Punk is supposed to have a devil-may-care attitude, but with the possible exception of The Ramones and The Dictators, they\u2019re all obsessed with image to the same degree as any other pop musicians. Paul Baloff sounds like a drunken punter who improbably found his way to the stage and made it his own.\n\nThe problem is that Exodus as a band never live up to his alcoholic enthusiasm. His incoherence is unearned. Bonded by Blood has already reached the kind of locked-in, stock violence that renders so many thrash records inert and formulaic. Sure it moves along at a good clip, though not so fast as some would have you believe, but it\u2019s too workmanlike and systematic for my tastes. Voivod was the kind of band Baloff should have been in. Can\u2019t you just see him piss drunk, dog-piling into a jeep with those wild Quebecois and off-roading in the snow dunes? The man was born to shriek garbled nonsense like \u201cGO SHIT! I\u2019M NOT A FISH!\u201d I mean, Voivod already had the inimitable Snake so the position was filled, but the point remains. Baloff needed a band as manic as he was. Dave Mustaine was crazy too, and it\u2019s the redeeming factor of the Megadeth records before he learned how to write. Mustaine\u2019s in complete control of his band, and thus they\u2019re scatterbrained disasters/masterpieces. Exodus lack the requisite inspired madness necessary to back up Baloff. It shouldn\u2019t be all that hard either. \u201cA Lesson in Violence\u201d is one of the most unhinged vocals you\u2019re ever likely to hear. Baloff is almost literally barking mad. Can we get a little shock value from the instruments then? Some feedback perhaps? One of the solos is fast enough to raise blisters, but so what? Christ, Pete Townshend had more authentic intensity when he stabbed his guitar into his Marshall stack in Tommy, and that was a major Hollywood musical co-starring Oliver \u2018My Fair Fucking Lady\u2019 Reed!\n\nI\u2019ve heard that Kirk Hammett taught Gary Holt how to play guitar, and that certainly jibes with the competent-yet-ever-so-slightly-behaved nature of his riffing. Although I think Hammett\u2019s a more creative musician than Holt is, Bonded by Blood would probably have sounded much the same had Kirk stayed in place of Hunolt. The H-Team can write a mean riff (see the impossibly catchy one under the impressive solo trade-offs of the otherwise interminable \u201cDeliver Us to Evil\u201d), but they don\u2019t know quite how to bring them to life. Say what you will about James Hetfield, but the man\u2019s swaggering lust for rock stardom electrifies Kill \u2018Em All in ways Bonded by Blood can only grasp at. Look no further than \u201cMetal Command\u201d, which definitely nicks a bit of the main riff from \u201cMotorbreath\u201d. \u201cMotorbreath\u201d is the perfect example of Metallica\u2019s trademark NWOBHM upratchet, everything breathless with enthusiasm and catchy as all get-out. \u201cMetal Command\u201d by comparison comes off a little flat, Baloff shrieking way above his natural range while the band trot along under him, unable to really get going because they\u2019re looking around for a doctor to deal with the blood squirting out of their front man\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s not that Exodus do a bad job, and \u201cMetal Command\u201d is a song that could definitely get the moshes going. It\u2019s just that it lacks the fun, the giddy-up that makes the best of the early thrash outfits endearing. They\u2019re craftsmen, not visionaries.\n\nI guess it makes sense then that, for my money, the album\u2019s best songs are the two mid-tempo efforts \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d and \u201cNo Love\u201d. Cornerstone 80\u2019s demon wax, sullen stones piled cathedral thick, masonry laid with leaden conviction. There\u2019s a reason people seldom refer to the fastest thrash songs as \u2018solid\u2019, and Exodus are at their best when they are solid. Even though this album\u2019s attempts at being sinister generally come off about as authentically as thrift-shop Halloween decorations, the slower pace allows the riffs to grind their way into you, those chintzy trimmings revealing finger-pricking steel hooks. This isn\u2019t exactly Trouble\u2019s soul-searing anguish, but Witchfinder General is not out of the question. Lots of nifty multi-tracking effects abound on \u201cNo Love\u201d, and the evil\u2019s thick enough you can almost understand why parents briefly thought this shit would push their kids from the straight and narrow down the short and easy road that leads from Heaven down to the flames. And if that allusion-heavy babble meant nothing to you, I\u2019ll let my balls do the talking (no invasive surgery required!). The band\u2019s undeniable way with tasty riffs is accentuated by the dynamic opportunities the variation in tempos provides. Certainly the blazing conclusion to \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d strikes the skull with a force few other riffs on the album manage.\n\nIt\u2019s that paucity of impact that I find to be the principle flaw of the work, which is a grievous one considering its nature. The album isn\u2019t by any means bad. Even if a lot of is just kinda there, it does occasionally cough up a real gem of a riff or a lick to keep you from completely zoning out. But highlights aside, the fact of the matter is, Bonded by Blood is the work of an opening band, not a headliner. People love to talk your ear off about how Exodus ended up being a second-tier band due to sheer bad luck. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but if Bonded by Blood had been released in 1984 as planned they still almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be part of the Big Four. It wasn\u2019t a matter of getting there first, as if any old speedster would\u2019ve mesmerized the metal public for all time if they\u2019d shipped out before Slayer\u2019s brand got burned into the masses. As I see it, this is an objective fact. What Exodus had to sell was not something that captured the imagination of people at large to the same degree as the Big Four, even within the underground. Subjectively, you can prefer whoever you damn well please. I can\u2019t prove to you Metallica were a better band, though I can illustrate why I think they are and perhaps sway your opinion. Subjectively, I think Exodus became an infinitely more entertaining band when they morphed into a poor man\u2019s Anthrax on Fabulous Disaster.\n\nBut I won\u2019t deny this about Bonded by Blood. It is a part of the canon. It has exerted influence that time cannot diminish. Some kid was probably pretending to be Paul Baloff when he set his mother\u2019s underwear drawer on fire while throwing the horns. It\u2019s in the Hall, in the foundations of grim ol\u2019 Mt. Metal. Shit like this is critic-resistant, regardless of my qualms about its actual quality. That last bit? Well I guess that\u2019s as good a definition of a metal Classic as any.\n\nStand-Outs: \u201cNo Love\u201d, \u201cAnd Then There Were None\u201d, \u201cA Lesson in Violence\u201d\n",
        "\nThat pretty much describes this album, very underrated. I really don't see why this album is so overlooked either. Sure, it sounds slightly more commercial than they're earlier relases, but that doesn't stop this album from kicking ass. It's pretty much an almost perfect sequel to Fabulous Disaster. The riffs are great, the solos are great, the songs are very catchy, and the production is great. The only major flaw I find in this album, is that Steve Souza's voice does tend to get pretty damn silly and incoherent at times which is why I didn't give this album a 90%, but it just makes the album slightly more humorous and fun. Other than that, this album is some of the nicest thrash you'll ever hear. \n\nIt has the lyrics and songwriting of Pleasures of the Flesh while also maintaining the fun and ultra catchiness of Fabulous Diasater, so it sounds a little like both albums. I actually enjoy this more than Pleasures of the Flesh.\n\nThe best songs on here vary a litlte. On one end, we have violent thrashers like the title track, A.W.O.L, Objection Overruled, and Only Death Decides. All of these songs have nice riffs, and the latter track inpaticular has to be the heaviest out of the four, and that solo fukcing slays! We have some nice thrash here. Then, one the other end we have songs that while they may not be as thrashy, are still fun as hell. \n\nChanging of the Guard and Thrash Under Pressure are surely the catchiest songs on this album. The formal sounds slightly punkish in the chorus, in that it's very catchy, and the lyrics thta tlak about political issues. \n\nHowevrer, there are songs that bring this album down a bit. Within the Walls of Chaos and Heads They Win (Tails You Lose) don't really do much for me. Borth songs are too long and the riffs are slightly weak. The Lunatic Parade sond slike an attempt at Toxic Waltz Part II, only not nearly as fun or thrashy. It's pretty much a watered down Toxic Waltz.\n\nFor the most part, this album is great from beginning to end. Aside for a small amount of filler and overtly silly moments, this album is pretty underrated. I really don't understand why this (and Force of Habit) went out of print. I wanted to get these albums, but had to either pay at least $30 to get them on eBay, or wait for the reissues (thank god for Caroline Records, hehe). So I just waited for the reiusses, and it was quite worth the wait. This album is one hell of a thrasher. Don't listen to Ultraboris this time and get the album. If you really enjoyed Fabulous Disaster, you'll at least dig this album, as it's a worthy follow up to that album. This album certainly thrashes under pressure!\n",
        "\nIt's 1992, and thrash is on it's last legs, this would be the start of grunge, but still, some bands managed to still release some solid albums, Exodus being one of them, as proven with \"Impact is Immiment\" in 1990.\n\nNow this album takes a different direction, it's still thrash, but it's more midpaced/groove, it can be compared to Testament's \"The Ritual\", it's like nothing Exodus released before.\n\nThe production is absolutely amazing, if I could change it today, I would not, as everything sounds right in the mix...even the bass.\n\nAnother small line-up change for this album, Mike Butler replaces Rob McKillop on this one, and does an admiral job.\n\nNow if I explained all the song, I would be here all day, because theres 15, so I'll mention the ones that I think stand out, first off, the opening track \"Thorn in my Side\" is a great opener, with a killer sludgy main riff, and it all flows nicely, sets the tone for the rest of the album, next, the title track, this just shreds, this is more like Impact is Imminent, great chorus and a shredding solo.\n\n\"Fuel for the Fire\" Has some great catchy leads and riffs, and great vocals as always by \"Zetro\", next off is \"One Foot in the Grave\" this is a really slow, grinding tune, kind of like the title track on Testament's \"The Ritual\" and it's heavy as all hell, with another great solo.\n\n\"Architect of Pain\" Now this, I think, is the best song on here hands down, it features some great melodic leads, and it changes tempo quite a bit throughout, and it has time to, as it's 11 minutes long, the song itself is a journey, the longest song Exodus ever did, \"Good Day to Die\" is very different, Zetro's vocals change in this one, from a more clean sound, to his more known raspy snarl, but it works well.\n\nLast is the closer \"Telepathetic\" as you probably guessed, it's against telepathic related things, it's pretty fast throughout, with alot of riot shouted vocals.\n\nNow, theres other good songs on here, but there are too many to list off, bottom line, if you like, say Testament's \"The Ritual\" then you should like this, you need to have an open mind, they tried something different with this album, and it worked for me.\n",
        "\nThis happens to most bands, they release their most critically acclaimed album, in this case \"Fabulous Disaster\", which was very popular, then a year later, they come out with this, and it goes un-noticed. I cannot understand why it did, as I find it a very good follow up. \n\nFirst off, the production. I find it to have the perfect production, even better than Fabulous Disaster, the guitars have more crunch to them, and it's very loud in the mix, which is fine with me, yet it's not overdone, and everything else sounds good in the mix, the drums have the right tone, not overdoing the guitar, which is one thing some albums have problems with, Zetro's vocals sound even better on this, the bass isn't really heard, but when is it in metal, very rarely.\n\nOne change in the line-up, White Zombie drummer \"John Tempesta\" who also did some work with Testament on Low, does the drumming here, while not as technical as Tom Hunting, he does a very nice job.\n\nThe album kicks off with \"Intro/Impact is Imminent\" which is this albums answer to \"The Last Act of Defiance\" with it's very thrashy riffs, and riot shouted vocals, very catchy chorus, then theres \"A.W.O.L\" which is one of my favorites from this, the whole song just works so well, very pissed off sounding, the riffs absolutley shred, so does the solo.\n\nThen theres \"The Lunatic Parade\" which is this albums answer to \"The Toxic Waltz\" it's very slow and grinding, by heavy as fuck, with some very catchy riffs and vocal lines, I'll skip to \"Only Death Decides\" which is another favorite of mine off this, great riffs, fast but catchy at the same time, and another very catchy chorus...and good lyrics as well, \"Heads They Win, Tails You Lose\" is another highlight here, not much to say about it though, just a kick ass song.\n\nI didn't want to go through all the songs, my review would be too long, but if you liked Fabulous Disaster, and don't mind hearing it again, then I suggest finding this, because all around, it's pretty much the same, but that doesn't bother me. Great album.\n",
        "\nEXODUS - 1982 DEMO\n\nExodus were an obvious early player in the Bay Area thrash scene, and a key one at that. Thats why this recording is so important, as it establishes early Exodus's characteristic sound. In fact the early Exodus sound wasn't similar to their later thrash recordings at all, as this is more in the cut of NWOBHM and speed metal bands. While the album features some obvious thrash moments, it is a cut of pure speed metal that could have been ripped right from Tank or Motorhead and installed in the bay area. Despite this some more aggressive overtones appear here, which would obviously be expanded upon by Exodus right up until their debut.\n\nWell onto the songs I suppose. \"Whipping Queen\" is a nice NWOBHM inspired track, with similar overtones and overall tone. This song would be covered by Bay Area bands for years to come, but unfortunately no band has yet decided to cover it with modern production. Thats a shame, because the track draws sympathy from its catchy chorus. This is probably the best song here, and is the one with the most value. I can understand why it never made it to later Exodus recordings but thats a shame if you ask me. Up next is \"Death and Domination\" which manages to have several riffs which scream \"Thrash!\" at me despite the terrible production. Despite this its easy to see why this song wasn't kept. \"Warlords\" also has a few more thrashy parts, but remains in the kind of oddball combination grounds that the other's do. \n\nOverall this is a solid Exodus demo that gets shows what Exodus started as really. Paul Baloff is here, along with Kirk Hammet's mediocre guitar playing and the competent job by the rest of the band. The production is downright horrible, with guitars that sound beyond muddy, drums that sound like they're being played down the street, and vocals that sound like he was screaming into a studio from the next room. Despite this \"Whipping Queen\" is a true keeper and Exodus classic, and the other tracks are far from completely worthless. This album is far from worthless.\n\nFinal Grade: 68\nFinal Thoughts: Hunt this down if you don't mind terrible production, are a true Exodus or thrasher, or want to see what all the fuss is about!\n",
        "\nI think this album, while being far from the best album to ever come from the minds of Gary Holt and Co., is still a solid modern thrash effort and is truly keeping the Exodus name alive in this, the new era of Thrash Metal.\n\nThe album in question is very much a mixture of the sounds found on the previous 2 efforts. It takes the overall aural chaos of \u201cShovel Headed Killing Machine\u201d and also parts of the refined energy from \u201cTempo Of The Damned\u201d\n\nTo start with, the production is bloody brilliant. Every guitar and bass note just sears holes through your head while the drums (courtesy of returning Exodus basher Tom Hunting) blow away what's left of your brain. Really truly great production values by one Andy Sneap (ex - Sabbat).\n\nThe Lyrical content of the album is also spot on, exactly what one would expect in Thrash lyrics. Addressing issues of war, violence, the hypocrisy of religion, etc. \u201cChildren of a Worthless God\u201d especially stands-out in this respect, becoming a searing attack on Islamic Extremists, being the first (?) Thrash song to specifically address the current political, military, and socio-religious climate in the middle east in the 21st century. \n\nI'm really starting to hone in to Rob Duke\u2019s vocal delivery. He has a very unique screech that is at once maddening and pleasant. It fits the songs very well and he has obviously matured a lot as a vocalist since \"Shovel Headed Killing Machine\" and I know long find his technique to be at times annoying.\n\nThe only qualm I really have about the album is the length of some of the songs. To me, thrash metal is supposed to be rough, fast, heavy, and somewhat brief. There are only a few Thrash songs that exceed 6 minutes that I really love. All in all though, there is only a couple long players on the album that bore me because of length. \n\nAll in all it's a very solid, if not spectacular, release from the Bay Area legends. I eagerly await the next release.\n\nStand-out Tracks:\n-Call To Arms/Riot Act\n-Children Of A Worthless God\n-Iconoclasm\n-Garden Of The Bleeding\n",
        "\nI was reading the reviews for \"The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A,\" and man, was I surprised. Quite a lot of people hate this album. I don't know why, I found this quite entertaining. That being said, this is the only Exodus album I have. But still, It has its good points, and one or two not-so-good points.\n\nLet's start with the good. \"Riot Act,\" the first actual song on this album, begins with a good intro riff. The lyrics just add to the package. They remind me of how I feel when I'm particularly pissed off. \"Smash and destroy everything in my path,\" reflects exactly how I feel when I'm insanely bored. The drums are fast and furious. The solos are faster than earlier Megadeth's solos. After \"Riot Act,\" we have \"Funeral Hymn,\" which starts off with a lightning fast solo. The riffs are amazing. The drums are still fast, even faster than the previous song. The lyrics are still pretty good. \"Children of a Worthless God,\" now there's a song worth noting. Starting off with an epic-sounding riff and solo, it only gets faster and better. The bass is well played, as are the drums. The lyrics really make you wonder about religion. Overall, the good points are the lyrics, drums, and guitars.\n\nThe bad point? The bass is barely audible. That's the only flaw I could decern on this album.\n\nGet this album as soon as you can, but if you have Exodus' older stuff, get \"The Atrocity Exhibition...\" as soon as possible.\n\nReccomended songs: Any and all on this disc!\n",
        "\nMost metalheads know the thrash band Exodus and all thrashers know the band Exodus, for being a legendary monster of a band that struck the scene ages ago thrashing their way to the top. Killing posers and non-believers with their music Exodus became a legend. Well, now many years later, Exodus has released their eight full length album and I could not say I haven't been this disappointed this year more excluding Elvenking. The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A is a new age thrash album that is full of hit and miss songs either falling into completely lifeless, mildly interesting or \"Sweet! This is actually good!\". Mostly following the old trend that Tempo of the Damned and Shovel Headed Killing Machine went through (which I both enjoyed, the latter the most) with a slickened production full of almost groovy riffs but still thrashing somewhat hard. \n\nThe songs here are divided into 3 sections for me: the worthless, the semi interesting, and the 'wish-this-was-how-the-whole-album-sounded'. Again, referring to the title, this is a complete hit and miss album, and unfortunately I think the misses outweigh the hits, or at least there are more of them. The hits though, I really enjoy and wish it was how the entire album sounded like because there are several really headbangable moments that make me yell \"hell yeah!\". But the misses are usually derived from fairly boring riffs, shitty lyrics, and unnecessarily long song lengths, which all typically outweigh a lot of the goods. Some songs (title track and Funeral Hymn) are 10 and 8 minutes long but while there are some complete kickass moments (the solos) they could have easily been cut down in length. Some riffs are typical of what a lot of new age thrash sounds like (new Overkill) but there are several which I can really enjoy like the opening of Funeral Hymn and the whole song of Iconoclasm. \n\nI'd also like to mention that the musicianship here is a complete bonus as always with Exodus. Gary Holt and Tom Hunting shine as usual, the solos are splendid and an absolute delight to the ears when they pop up; very worthy of headbanging. Tom Hunting does an excellent job on drums good to seem him back as well, banging his kit to oblivion sometimes (opening of Iconoclasm). Some prominent bass lines show themselves occasionally too which are always a delight in thrash metal. Rob Dukes is kinda sorta a decent vocalist, halfway between barking and spitting the words out which by the way suck. I really think the lyrics here are worthless, yelling on about anti-war crap or how Christians suck or some other crap, very politically based which I never found to be interesting or at least how this is done. \n\nSo while this album isn't complete horseshit I find myself being bored slightly more than I am entertained. The songs being too long don't add to this as well as the seemingly uninspired riffing at times. But still, definitely a hit and miss album that makes me wonder why the album couldn't just be like the hits in this album. The misses are extreme and the hits are entertaining but in the long run this album could have been better but instead seems slightly half assed. It's a shame, I wish Exodus could have pulled off at least another Shovel Headed Killing Machine but I guess not, maybe Exhibit B will be better...\n",
        "\nBut, it's pretty damn close to being one. I was certainly wrong about this album. I was too easy on it first time I reviewed it. I digged this album the first two or three times I listened to it, now it really leaves a bitter taste in my ears every time I listen to it. It's not entirely a bad release, but it's far from good either. For the most part, this is a mediocre release from an aging thrash band. \n\nI have three huge problems with this album. First, that guitar tone. Even though it may sound \"heavy\" to some, it has to be one of the most boring and worst guitar tones I've ever heard. It sounds very sludgy, so sludgy infact, that you can hardly hear any of the riffs. For the most part, all you hear is a bunch of chugging throughout the whole album. Next, is Rob Dukes. I do not care for this guy at all. He sounds like a Paul Baloff wannabe just without the attitude that Baloff had, and half of the time, his screams can sound pretty \"coreish\" which tend to get on my nerves. Oh, and the clean singing he does on Children of a Worthless God sounds even worse. The last problem I have is that the majority of the songs are too long. If some of the songs were a bit shorter, perhaps I would've given this album a few more points, but when you have generic chugging \"thrash\" songs that clock up to 10 minutes, it tends to bore the hell out of you. \n\nAbout the only songs that hold their own here are Riot Act and Bedlam 123. Both are solid modern sounding thrashers, and the latter track has to be the better of the two. It's fast and heavy, the way thrash should be.\n\nThat, unfortenately, is about as good as this album gets. The rest of these songs range from mediocre to so painfully boring that it hurts just to listen to these atrocities. These songs are long and the \"riffs\" are generic are boring. For the most part this is just sped up groove metal with shitty vocals. The only reaosn these songs qualify as thrash at all is because the drumming at least stays fast and consistent. The title track, inpaticular, has to be the worst out of the bunch. The song is 10 minutes worth of boring chuga chuga riffs and half-assed screaming which qualifies as vocals. I'd rather listen to Pantera than listen to this shit again, nuff said. Funeral Hymn is pretty decent with some alright riffs yet also suffers form being way too long ofr it's own good.\n\nFor the most part, this album is mediocre and pretty forgetable. Damn, and I thought this band could do no wrong too. The three releases that came before this one (Force of Habit, Tempo of the Damned, and Shovel Headed Killing Machine) were all good albums, and the albums before those were obvious classics, but this album does not match the standards that this band has. What a fucking disappointment! Download Riot Act and Bedlam 123, and avoid the rest of this album! You'll thank yourself later.\n",
        "\nExodus are back with a new album. That is usually cause to rejoice but seeing as how this was the follow up to Shovel Headed Kill Machine I was more than a little worried. Initial news of clean vocals and jumpy riffs simply added to the tension. When i finally got my hands on this album though, most of my initial fears were dismissed. There's little evidence of any core elements and the clean vocals comprise of 2 lines used as a chorus in one song. \n\nThe album starts with a rather pointless intro before kicking things off with Riot Act. The song immediately brings to mind the material on Tempo Of The Damned and things get off to a proper Exodus start. The riffs are jagged and heavy and there's a vintage lead guitar part in the middle of the song. The next thing that struck me was that Rob Dukes sounds a lot more like Souza on this album. It's quite a change as the vocalist has dropped most of his barking style. After this promising start though, the album is a bit hit and miss. The lengthy Funeral Hymn starts with a pretty generic riff that goes nowhere before the song picks up any momentum, while the equally lengthy Children Of A Worthless God sounds good in a God Forbid meets Iced Earth kind of way for the first six minutes before going off into some pointless samples. The songs are mostly pretty fucking long and don't hold your attention all the way through. This is particularly true of the title song, a ten minute epic that just fizzles out halfway through. Iconoclasm is another boring song with some more boring generic riffing that seems to go on and on. The Garden Of Bleeding manages to lift its head above the mundane surroundings with is slow brooding start before exploding into some thrash metal goodness and album closer Bedlam 123 is full of some really aggressive riffs but it's a case of too little too late. \n\nJack Gibson benefits a bit on this album with a terrific bass guitar tone and I don't think the bass has ever been this clear on an Exodus album. His playing on the title song is worth a listen and the only redeeming factor on it. Hunting, who returns to the band with this album sounds strangely subdued here and I guess the same is true of the band. The intensity of old and the threat of violence is missing on this album just like it was missing on the last one. While Andy Sneap did a terrific job on Tempo Of The Damned , here the production is very clean. The rough around the edges sound of classic Exodus has been replaced by a super clean sound that just sucks some of the life out of The Atrocity Exhibition (A). \n\nWhile this isn't a bad album and there are some good songs here it just doesn't sound too much like Exodus. The Atrocity Exhibition Exhibit A sounds like it was written by some new band that wants to sound just like Exodus did on Tempo Of The Damned. \n\nwww.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nThis isn't thrash the way it meant to be. This isn't an album that 'Exodus' had to release. Geez, this isn't an album that had to be released at all!\n\nCome on! This is one of the most pointless albums I've heard in a long time. \n9 songs clocking at almost 60 minutes...not even single minute which sounds more than \"boring generic riffage which goes through the motions and has a strange vibe of mallcore\". 'Riot Act' has a very bad wanky riffing which sounds like a tetris music with distortion, the lead guitar utterly blows and sounds extremely offhand, same goes with the embarrassing chorus.\n\nBoth 'Funeral Hymn' and 'Children Of A Worthless God' are absolute exaggeration! You just can't masturbate repetitive riffing for 8 minutes and sound bearable at the same time...it's impossible.\n\nInstead of tell you how each song is suck I will sum it up: forget from the 'Exodus' you knew, this album is just another modern death/thrash mediocrity, nothing you should really care for.\n\n'The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A' wins the award of the biggest disappointment of 2007. Let's just expect that the second part won't be worse than this, if possible.\n",
        "\nSo this was the second full length offering from Exodus, and it's pretty different from Bonded by Blood. This was due to a couple of things. One was that their former vocalist Paul Baloff was replaced with Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, and there styles differ a fair amount from each other. Also this album found Exodus in a state of artistic \"progression\". They were moving away from the completely fucking balls out thrasher that were displayed on the first album, and moving on to the lighter thrash sound that was so fucking popular at the time. So pretty much anyone that worshipped Bonded by Blood (i.e. everyone) should have seen that this album wasn't going to be nearly as good as its predecessor. While I would love to say that these people were proved dead fucking wrong, I can't because this album doesn't even come close to the quality of Bonded by fucking Blood. Now with that said this is not a bad album at all. For what it is, it's actually pretty fucking good. It definitely has its flaws but overall it is a quality release and a good listen.\n\nSo I'll start off with the bad stuff. The biggest problem with this album is that it feels incomplete at times. Like they crank out a few really good riffs, they write a great chorus, but the verses fall flat. Of course there are different variations of this. The song \"Till Death Do Us Part\" really suffers from this. It has an awesome main riff and a good chorus riff, but the verses just sound tired and boring. It sounds as if halfway through the song Exodus just got tired and went to bed. The thing is I can't really call the song bad simply because of the kick ass riffs. The one at 2:51 is particularly good. \"Brain Dead\" is another sort of incomplete song. Again it's got some good riffs and the verses are decent, but the chorus is bad, and I mean really bad. It consists of Zetro whispering, yes whispering, braaaain dead a few times. Whispering should never be used in metal and much less in a fucking Exodus song. Come on guys, what are you thinking? The other problem with this album is that there seems to be a lot of random, stupid shit thrown in for no reason. The title track is a very good song but for some reason it has about a minute of stupid jungle noises at the start. My question is why. Why would this be necessary in a song? It doesn't give the song any sense of atmosphere and it definitely doesn't sound good. Then there is the stupid song \"30 seconds\" which is basically just someone fucking around with an acoustic guitar. The track is worthless and shouldn't be on the album. \n\nWhile this album does have a number of flaws, the majority of it is good. All of the songs, besides the ones mentioned above, are pretty good at the worst. Most of the good songs are at about the same level, but there are a few all out highlights on here. \"Deranged\" is a fucking face-melter of a song. The intro riff is excellent, so is the verse riff. It has a really good chorus and a long but well done solo. The song really wouldn't sound at all out of place on BbB. \"Seeds of Hate\" is the best song on the album. The riffs are really good through the whole song. The verses are good and the chorus is pretty damn catchy. However, the part that really makes this song a classic is the insane middle section, with an amazing riff at 2:20. \n\nAs I said before the difference in the vocal styles of Baloff and Zetro is a quite drastic one. While Zetro's vocals are good, they don't pack the same punch as Baloff's did. Baloff's vocal possessed this feeling of blind rage that really cannot be replicated. Zetro's vocals are pretty good. They are high-pitched and have this sort of snotty, for lack of a better term, feel to them. They\u2019re kind of tongue in cheek in a way. Think about this, if Baloff's vocals are yelled with aggression, then Zetro's vocals are said with a smirk. If Baloff is Henry Rollins, then Zetro is Keith Morris. Analogies aside, Zetro is a good vocalist in his own right, but he is nothing compared to the thrash metal beast that is Paul Baloff. \n\nIn the end this album is a good one. It has some flaws but all in all they're pretty easy to ignore. The majority of the songs are good and some of them are fucking great. This album was a little disappointing because it came out after Bonded by Blood, but on it's own it is definitely a good listen.\n",
        "\nWith releasing this piece of boredom called \u2018The Atrocity Exhibition\u2019 Exodus certainly did their best to make their earlier 2005 album Shovel Headed Kill Machine sound like real thrash metal. Whereas on Shovel it was the horrid computerized production and the metalcore vocals of Rob Dukes that ruined the possibility of it being a fairly decent thrash metal album, this time they also got rid off real riffs and up tempo songs leaving us with nothing but 59 minutes of\u2026 sound.\n\nWith their decent comeback album \u2018Tempo Of The Damned\u2019 the band were still recognisably Exodus albeit with a modern production and a higher amount of mid paced material. But in 2007 there is nothing left reminding us of what Exodus once was, a raging thrash metal band with superb riffs and cool characteristic vocals. With \u2018The Atrocity Exhibition\u2019 Exodus have released something that can be compared to Testament\u2019s \u2018Demonic\u2019 or Slayer\u2019s \u2018Diabolus In Musica\u2019 being an album that should have been released under a different name with a different audience in mind. \n\nProgression can be a good thing, but throwing everything away that made you famous in the first place can be considered stupidity. Would this have been a brand new band, I would have given the album about 40 or 50 points, for there are some nice moments but never good nor great. Knowing this is the band that once released Fabulous Disaster and Bonded By Blood, we the fans can do nothing else but cry, accept our loss and leave the cemetery. Exodus has passed away. Probably to be summoned from the dead (again) in a few years with Hunolt and Souza.\n",
        "\nArmed with the razor sharp wit of Oscar Wilde, I can't help but say; this album is an apt exhibition of how atrocious metal can be. I can sympathise with these 80's thrash bands, to them groove metal is just as alluring as the forbidden fruit was to the mythical cocktease Eve, and rightly so I suppose. Groove metal requires no talent and your average metalhead thinks it's good because it's so heavy and brutal. Unfortunately Exodus do not get the benefit of the doubt, with 'Tempo of the Damned' they managed to prove it was possible to make a mostly decent thrash/groove album in the vein of Pantera's 'Cowboys from Hell', of course they cocked that up right away when they release 'Shovel Headed Kill Machine' and they've continued on the downward spiral to mediocrity with this next installment which apparently has a guaranteed follow-up album. How grim, if by extrapolation the next album follows the trend of suckitude then I shan't sleep for a good week thanks to caffeine laced paranoia at the thought of trudging through an album similar to or even worse than this one.\n\nThe alarm bells ring loud and clear as soon as you look over the track list; the songs are really fucking long, now let it be known that I'm no adverse to long song but when all you can write is a couple of shitty groove riffs to stretch over 5 - 10 minutes you're starting to test my patience and cause me to question my thoughts on just how masochistic I really am. Take the title track \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", barely 1/3rd of the way through the song and we've only heard two different riffs; two plodding and utterly lamentable groove riffs for about 3 and half minutes. The following solo is also lacking in the balls department but that's to be expected I suppose, if you're too lazy to even write a few thrash riffs then why bother with writing blazingly awesome solos right? Admittedly the second solo in the song is a lot better but it's questionable as to whether it's worth slogging through 7 minutes of poorly written groove metal to hear one good solo when I could go put 'Rust in Peace' or 'Painkiller' on instead. Not even the shortest (disregarding the introduction track) song on this album \"Riot Act\" is decent. Usually you get at least one thrash song out of these dried-up husks of former glory but it appears they can't even recall how to thrash the fuck out. It has some speed at least and the solos are okay at best but otherwise it's just a shorter and somewhat faster version of the other songs on the album, its entire existence seems to be based around being released as single for this album.\n\nI think the biggest offender in this album is the general lack of originality, take for instance the trade-off solo section in the middle of \"Bedlam 123\"; your first impression is outright fucking joy because they're finally doing something worthwhile but once you get your shit sorted you realise the solos themselves are fairly lackluster and fail to be individualistic or inventive in any sense of the word. Also Rob Dukes counting down \"1 2 3\" in the choruses of this song is grating and rather, dare I use the term, mallcore-ish. I don't dislike him as a vocalist, he seems to mesh well with the shitty groove riffs and it makes the lyrics unintelligible which is probably in their best interests since they sound like they came from the desk of an introverted and fanatically atheist 15 year old know-it-all with nothing better to do than wank furiously over La Blue Girl episodes and post on shitty internet forums with a fervor only matched by devianTART fandom 'artists'.\n\nThat's the entirety of this album; shitty groove riff after shitty groove riff, uninspiring solo or two, really long fucking songs, decent drumming, mediocre if not outright irritating vocals and the occasional appearance from the once believed to be complete mythical creature known in our human tongue as a 'bassist'. Thought 'Shovel Headed Kill Machine' was good? Think Lamb of God are like the best new metal band ever and are totally brutal? Suffer from symptoms akin to severe brain damage and pop Ritalin like they were skittles? Then this album is right up your alley, not unlike how a part of myself is right up your mother's alley. Frequently.\n",
        "\n\"there will never have been anything as brutal and genre defining done before in thrash metal. An epic monster this one is, and the next is going to take it even further.\"\n\nThis is a quote taken from Exodus from their announcement of this album. This sure is a bold statement. The question is did Exodus live up to this? The answer is absolutely not. I could go on and on about more brutal or epic or genre defining albums. The Atrocity Exhibition is nothing of the sort in anyway. This is just another lifeless groove album.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me when listening is just how obnoxious the riffs really are. The riffs are very simple utilizing very few chords and are not at all choppy but just complete groove and worst of all is that Exodus are very repetitive with these riffs and most of the tracks last for a long time. Occasionally Exodus will attempt a thrash riff but they are just to stop/start to work and end up giving me a headache. If you want a thrash riff to work in this case you have to link the chords quicker. The solos are also pretty useless. They seem to mostly be used just for the sake of it and there is no structure in the songs that seems to make them fit. They are neither fast nor technical except on the rare occasion and that is definitely not a good thing as it just makes them sound lifeless and boring.\n\nThe drumming was the only thing I enjoyed when listening to Shovel Headed Kill Machine. Here I didn't even notice the drums unless I forced myself to listen to them. And then I just heard an occasional bang on the drums; no fills, no variation. It could almost have been a poorly programmed drum machine.\n\nNow Rob Dukes makes a very slight improvement here from his performance on Shovel Headed Kill Machine but that really isn't saying too much. His voice is still largely in metalcore territory and sounds very dry, and monotonous. Occasionally he goes a little bit deeper but this is only by a small amount but is still largely welcomed as it is an improvement but this is not enough to save the vocal performance here. Worst of all clean background singing is used that further solidifies the band's connections with metalcore. The fact that I am reminded greatly of all those formulaic metalcore bands such as trivium with their back and forth between annoying shouts and clean singing is certainly not a good thing.\n\nThere is virtually nothing that can save this album, not even the production which is actually quite good as it sounded a little muddy and highlighted the appropriate parts but if these parts are useless to begin with then it doesn't really matter.\n\nOverall I am glad that I didn't even waste my time downloading this album but rather just listened to it's entirety from Exodus' Myspace page. I hope the band continues to do this so more people like me can realize how bad they sound and are put off from wasting their money. If you want real thrash from 2007 then check out releases by Lich King, Ultimatum, Dekapitator and Chaosphere. Don't waste your time or energy on this.\n",
        "\nI've been detecting a slight backlash , a bubbling of negativity around this LP at the moment, that I can't really work out. I mean, what the fuck do some people want? Here we have a band, basically spent as a creative entity not 2 LPs ago, filled with ex-junkies, their spiritual karmic force of a vocalist tragically expires, their day job singer finally admits his heart isn't in it after about 10 years and walks, and what do they do? Quit? No they don't. They pull their heads in, get bum down arse up for while, get a raging new vocalist, and GET BETTER. No they don't recapture the glory days, but they GET BETTER. They shrug off the prevailing metal zeitgeists and release a fairly damn stonking LP with the new singer, and then GET AMBITIOUS. They announce 2 back to back LPs (thematic even?) and they start to get shitcanned for it. I still can't work out why, but I'll get back to you if I do.\n\n\"Atrocity\" is ok, it really is. The only LP I have tried to compare it to is \"Shovel\", because to my mind, pre-\"Shovel\" is a different band. What the band have definitely recaptured over these last 2 LPs is their thrash mojo. The aggro is back in a big way as we all know, and certainly a focus on trying to get the riffs up to par. I've got a little bad news there, because I don't think the riffs on \"Atrocity\" are quite as good as those on \"Shovel\". But you may beg to differ. The songs are goodish. Nothing as really as instant as \"Deathamphetamine\" or \"I Am Abomination\" but they aren't a bad batch. \"Riot Act\" is a reasonable opener but the chorus doesn't quite explode like they think it does. \"Funeral Hymn\" works, with it's heard it all before but still this good intro, and then a degenerative loop of a riff, and no chorus. (Now there's an idea.) \"Children of a Worthless God\" is the anti-Islam rant, this time with a chorus, that is passable, and a nice bouncy rhythm that will go over well live. \"As it Was\" is less typical, slower, with a riff I like, almost angular(?), then again not really but not the usual serving from this band. The title track is pretty much all over the shop, 10 minutes, lots of savage parts, mid-tempo parts, there's that ambitious word again, but does it gel? Neeeeaaahhhh, kinda. \"Iconoclasm\" starts in this is more like it territory, an unadulterated throat ripper riff, then some vocal effects in the \"tribal\" verses and another not quite there chorus. Ah, fuck it, it's good enough. \"The Garden of Bleeding\" is , sorry to say, where I have to draw the line, it's a boring non event of a song, with a minute and a half opening of pure drudgery, before a riff that the fan club president probably wrote, and more \"ambition\". Zzzzzzz. But don't panic, \"Bedlam 123\" is here to save the day, if you can get around another 90 sec mid-tempo intro, with some straight down the line Exo-Frash. Nice. \n\nNo this LP is not great, it's just clawing at good, but really, so what? The last one was pretty damn killer and I'm just happy the band is around to provide some kind of antidote to the retro-thrash legions and dopey metalcore copycats. Keep it up boys, long may you keep churning out the same 7 and a half riffs.\n",
        "\nAll throughout their career, Exodus have been given the short-end of the stick. After pioneering the Bay Area thrash sound, co-founder Kirk Hammet left to join Metallica, which later greatly eclipsed Exodus. It came almost like a slap to the face when the phrase \u201cThe Big Four\u201d began to be thrown around, and Exodus wasn\u2019t included (they were actually placed in \u201cThe Little Four\u201d, which was made up of Overkill, Dark Angel, Testament, and Exodus). Most of their work has been regarded by critics as a good time, if not slightly 2nd-rate material. However, with \u201cThe Atrocity Exhibition\u2026Exhibit A\u201d, Exodus might show a different sound formula, but they\u2019re still pumping out quality albums, which is more than Metllica or Anthrax can say.\n\n\u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d was the band\u2019s reunion album, which featured Exodus roaring onto the modern-thrash scene with pure aggression, and was later mirrored by \u201cShovel Headed Kill Machine.\u201d Returning this time around is drummer/co-founder Tom Hunting, who was absent on \u201cShovel Headed Kill Machine\u201d, and is joined with guitarist Lee Altus from Heathen. Combined with Gary Holt (guitar), Jack Gibson (bass), and Rob Dukes (vocals), Exodus promised an album that would redefine the genre of thrash and be a landmark in the metal community. \n\nFirst off, this is not going to redefine the genre in any way. Nothing here is going to cause some kind of revolution, or provoke a new way of writing thrash, nor is this going to be hailed a classic for the ages. However, \u201cThe Atrocity Exhibition\u2026Exhibit A\u201d features some of the best material Exodus has put out in awhile, due to its high-level of intensity and mature tones. Following along with the popular trend of a moody, instrumental intro, \u201cA Call to Arms\u201d comes in softly with a military-style drum roll and soothing guitar. It soon quickly shatters as the distortion is kicked on, and very quickly \u201cRiot Act\u201d blasts through the speakers, unleashing 2-years worth of pent-up frustration at failed governments, religion, and society in general. Rob Dukes immediately makes his presence known as he calls forth for listeners to \u201cRise up and revolt, Overthrow the government! Level all the temples, Destroy the monuments!\u201d Lee and Gary blaze forth on guitar, putting forth pulverizing, jack-hammer riffs and scorching solos, all the while being backed up by Hunting\u2019s frantic double bass.\n\nWhile most of the tracks don\u2019t feature \u201cRiot Act\u2019s\u201d blistering speed, they make up for it in their raw power. Tracks like \u201cFuneral Hymn\u201d and especially \u201cIconoclasm\u201d feature lock-heavy riffs that buzz like chainsaws, all the while being met by Rob Dukes\u2019 frantic screams. Many might found Dukes annoying, since has more of a \u201chardcore\u201d sound due to his past punk bands that he performed in, but he varies his voice constantly. On the highlight track, \u201cChildren of a Worthless God\u201d, Dukes even engages in clean singing during the chorus. He\u2019s no Bruce Dickinson, but it\u2019s a nice change-up of the snarls and screams that he is usually emitting (at top-quality, mind you). Gary and Lee show off just how strong they perform together with face-grinding riffs, mainly on the anthem-thrasher \u201cBedlam 123\u201d, which is bound to send crowds into a mosh frenzy. Also, the addition to Lee to the line-up was a great choice, since Gary and Lee constantly team-up to deliver melting solo after solo. Tom Hunting is also a huge benefit to this album, especially on the crushing \u201cIconoclasm\u201d, where Tom blasts open the song with a mini-solo before beating the song into submission with his kit.\n\nMost of the tracks on \u201cTAE\u2026EA\u201d reach over 6-minutes in length, so this takes some getting used to. The title track at first listen may seem like one of the most repetitive thrash songs ever written, but given time to sink in, it turns out to be a complete winner, as it\u2019s pinched-riffs help Rob to deliver venom-filled lines of \u201cYou speak to the sky, and no one answers back!\u201d The length also seems to speak volumes about the maturity in the lyrical content on this album, since it all deals with religion, war, and government. Gone are the murder themed, almost light hearted one-liners present on \u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d and \u201cShovel Headed Kill Machine\u201d. This exhibit deals strictly with the plagues of society, and Exodus aim to show the world just how pissed off they are. Probably the best example would be anti-Islamic track \u201cChildren of a Worthless God\u201d, which accuses Islamic extremists of \u201cpraising the death of the free\u201d and wishing to see a \u201cUnited States of Islam\u201d. That\u2019s not to say that Christianity doesn\u2019t get its fair share of bashing, since the title track openly mocks those who follow God. Nothing in the modern world is safe from Rob Dukes\u2019 wrath on \u201cTAE\u2026EA\u201d, and the fact that the lyrics don\u2019t have him dealing out constant swear words to get his point across is a huge plus.\n\nWhat holds \u201cTAE\u2026EA\u201d back is that Exodus over-hyped this album too much. Calling it an album to redefine the genre was a huge boast, and they didn\u2019t accomplish it. The tracks are very long for a thrash album, and take many repeated listens to get into. With the title track being over 10-minutes long, many might just hit the skip button. Over time, however, the album will sink in, but it\u2019s still disappointing to see it take so many listens just to get used to, then even more to actually enjoy the album thoroughly. That, and the track \u201cGarden of Bleeding\u201d, which comes off as a filler due to its placement between two great tracks (\u201cIconoclasm\u201d and \u201cBedlam 123\u201d) and it\u2019s dry riffs, are what really will frustrate a lot of old-time fans, as well as newcomers.\n\nExodus might not have created a metal masterpiece, but they\u2019ve created something that screams to be acknowledged and not taken lightly. \u201cThe Atrocity Exhibition\u2026Exhibit A\u201d is a huge success for the band, and shows off a new level of maturity that wasn\u2019t seen by them yet. Tracks such as \u201cChildren of a Worthless God\u201d and \u201cBedlam 123\u201d are going to become staples at Exodus shows, and fans will eat them up when played live. So until Exodus hits society with \u201cExhibit B\u201d, this exhibit should produce frequent visits from those who can accept the long song lengths.\n\nOverall \u2013 4/5 \n\nRecommended Tracks\nA Call to Arms/Riot Act\nChildren of a Worthless God\nThe Atrocity Exhibition\nBedlam 123\n",
        "\nYes, I'm afraid to say, this is better than Bonded By Blood. I appreciate Blood had a bigger impact, was more special in it's day, and deserves all due credit for that, but when it comes down to which I'd rather listen to, Fabulous Disaster wins out (indeed, Bonded By Blood only gets third place in Exodus' catalogue, Tempo of the Damned also beating it). Bonded By Blood is more of a straightforward blast of thrash, pure and simple. Fabulous Disaster perfectly represents the wild, fun, almost punk side of Thrash. Indeed, the atmosphere and vocals do evoke a kind of punk feeling, and it's just plain great. One look at the lyrics of Toxic Waltz tells you just what this album is all about: it's not raising big socio-political issues, or challenging the world. It's just a fun ride of thrash. Another example: Low Rider. Exodus aren't taking themselves too seriously, they're just out to play great thrash, and this song sounds great done in this style, it's not at all out of place, and it personifies that punkish feel of just not caring. They don't roar defiance in the face of society: they ride past in a car making rude gestures out of the window and laughing all the way, that's what Fabulous Disaster feels like.\n\nThere are three things that really make this album the beauty it is. Firstly, the overall sound, the production. It's got that very raw edge that thrash needs, but everything is so clear. It's really quite special to me, given it's year of release: not many can equal this in clarity and great sound. Very chugging, very vicious, but never sounding tinny or too quiet. It makes it much more catchy, and it really sticks in your head.\n\nSecond, and kind of tied into that, is the riffing. Oh the riffing. Simply some of the best. Here Exodus have come up with some incredible guitar work, and they know it, flaunting it beautifully. In particular it's the catchy, rough riffs that make Fabulous Disaster itself and Verbal Razors stand out. They don't change much, but they're really put to good use. They mesh perfectly with the vocals, and will be stuck firmly in your head on the first listen. This, combined with the production I mentioned, really helps the tracks stand out from one another and become instantly identifiable.\n\nAnd thirdly, but by no means least, the vocals. Again, I'm a bit of a heretic: Paul Baloff might have been a good vocalist, but Steve is something else. His nasal, slightly high voice marks him out, and he makes very good use of it, it's unique and sometimes hard the describe, the only real comparisons I can think to make are Dave Mustaine or AC/DC, that kind of style. It conveys insulting, wild aggression well, and fits in perfectly with this punk-influenced style of music. You will know him right away whenever a song is playing that he's singing on. Also, I can very clearly make out what's being said, so the lyrical side becomes all the more powerful and core to it. Thus it feels much more complete as an album. I can air-guitar and sing along properly, something sometimes absent from early thrash records I'm sorry to say. With few other releases do I have so little need to look up lyrics to know them, and he always carries so much energy. That vast list of vicious insults in Verbal Razors sounds so genuine and real, so simply honest, you can't help but try to sing along as soon as you know the words well enough.\n\nIn particular what Fabulous Disaster does better than most albums is make use of both vocals and instruments. Neither sounds like they're just backing up the other. Sometimes one leads, sometimes the other, but they're always consistently strong. It's truly crafted, not just thrown together. In Verbal Razors, Fabulous Disaster and Like Father, Like Son the vocals fly at you rapid-fire, just like the guitar. When it slows down, so does Steve. Take a look at the drums too: they know just when to stop to put emphasis on the guitar and when to beat along with it. Every part of the band supports everything else, and as I say, it makes it feel much more complete. At around the five minute mark in Like Father, Like Son, for example, it cuts into a fresh riff, and at first just focuses on the guitars. Lets you get that riff stuck in your head, then the rest blasts back in. All very well done, and while these techniques are by no means exclusive to Exodus, they master them.\n\nOpen Season is a really good example of doing something fairly common in thrash, but much better: the main riff and feel of it is oft done, but in this mix the drums are much more at the fore, pushing forward the pace that is so crucial to that style. It's not afraid to vary it too, sometimes tracks like that don't change much and become boring, but Exodus throw in half a dozen other great moments to break it up, and all the way through Steve is keeping it fresh with his memorable and perfectly audible vocals. Still aggressive, still raw, but not sacrificing simple clarity.\n\nThere really aren't any duff tracks, although there are a few that stand out for me as particularly special. Verbal Razors is a machine-gun-pace tirade of hate (but as ever, done in a lively way rather than relying on sheer brutality) which breaks half way through into some of the best and more gorgeous soloing I've ever heard. Fabulous Disaster is likewise a heck of an angry rant, and yet it never takes itself overly seriously (e.g. the Dr. Ruth reference towards the end). It's also worth noting that with the current political climate and so on, it's a surprisingly relevant song even today. The other big winner for me is of course Toxic Waltz, the perfect song for any fun-loving mosher, it personifies that slightly insane feeling of merry moshing; \"Everybody's doin' the toxic waltz, Good friendly violent fun in store for all, Get up off your ass and toxic waltz, If you hit the floor you can always crawl!\". Having said all that though, this is all good stuff. Perhaps the only track that breaks slightly from this wild merriment is The Last Act of Defiance, which feels distinctly more brutal than the others, reminding me of the likes of War Is My Shepard or any from Shovel-Headed Killing Machine from later work. But it just nicely varies things further, and still has plenty of playfulness to be found, especially in those solos which, like the rest of the album, are all about injecting even more energy into the song.\n\nHere Exodus take what they had on their first two releases and really master it all. It's a beautifully crafted piece of thrash, some of the best I've heard. It's not the most technical, intellectual or brutal (although it's certainly not lacking in those areas either), but it's perfectly catchy, fun and above all thrashy. If you fancy a bit of raw thrash with plenty of fun-tinted anger and healthy doses of skill and mastery, this is for you.\n",
        "\nThis album manages to take all of the best aspects of thrash metal and throw them into a killer CD. It's fun sounding, yet heavy. Usually I'm more into brutal thrash metal, and not melodic thrash. Fabulous Disaster falls into a great spot inbetween.\n\nI actually hear a lot of east cost thrash influence here. Yes, it's Bay Area as Bay Area can be, but the guitar work and beat of most songs screams Anthrax to me. This is what makes the album so good. It's upbeat, but there's that nice crunch that the Bay Area bands always cram into their albums. \n\nIf you're reading this and don't understand what I mean by \"fun sounding thrash\", listen to the third track, Toxic Waltz. After kicking off the album with two straight forward (but not in a bad way) tracks, Toxic Waltz comes in and lifts the entire albums atmosphere. The fun doesn't stop there, as the next track is a cover of \"Lowrider\", which I thought was pretty funny for a thrash band to do. That being said, it's really good! I love that tune played on a crunchy-sounding thrash guitar. \n\nAfter that song ends and we get a strange little southern-ambient intro and Exodus get a little more serious for Cajun Hell. This is followed by the strongest song on the CD, Like Father, Like Son. This song has a great main riff, slowed down and epic. It's not without its sped up thrash though. The great thing about Fabulous Disaster is the distinct differences from song to song. As with any genre, occasionally thrash CD's have a group of songs together without any big difference between them. This album is one of the farthest from that definition. \n\nOne of the strongest point of this-era Exodus to me is vocalist Steve Souza. He is made to do vocals for a thrash band. I say vocals rather than \"sing\" because this isn't a band like Forbidden or Overkill with a traditional metal vocalist, but rather a pissed off metalhead yelling obscenities. I really wish he had been in Exodus for all of their releases, including the most recent ones.\n\nFabulous Disaster has a little bit of everything for every thrash fan. There's the ultra heavy and ballsy Like Father, Like Son. There's the fun-loving yet violent Toxic Waltz. There's even some covers (well, one unless you get the CD I picked up that has a cover of the AC/DC song Overdose). This is one of the first thrash albums I'd recommend to a new fan.\n",
        "\nWith the highly successful Bonded By Blood, Exodus was hailed as an essential thrash metal band. However, after the album, vocalist Paul Baloff would depart from the band. That didn't stop them though, and they replaced Baloff with Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, singer of fellow bay area thrash band Legacy (who would change their name to Testament). This was a great move as Zetro is easily a much better vocalist than Baloff. His voice is insane, evil, and very unique. Zetro's vocals are what makes Pleasure of the Flesh better than Bonded By Blood in my opinion.\n\nThe other members of the make the music amazing along with Zetro's vocals. Guitarists Rick Hunolt and Gary Holt are a great team, switching off leads and solos and shredding like crazy. The riffs are just as killer as the solos. Bassist Rob McKillop does a great job as a bass player, giving the riffs and guitars that amazing extra kick. Drummer Tom Hunting is amazing, almost up there with Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. His double bass and tom fills all kick ass on this album.\n\nThe songs on this album are some classic thrash tunes. Deranged, Till Death Do Us Part, Parasite, Brain Dead, and Chemi-kill are all standout tracks and every other track is amazing also. \n\nI find Pleasures of the Flesh to be one of the most underrated albums in all of thrash. While Bonded By Blood put Exodus up with other thrashers, POTF, in my opinion is the superior album with better vocals, guitars, songs, production, etc. If you're looking for a killer thrash album, then you won't go wrong with buying Pleasures of the Flesh.\n",
        "\nWow. Ignore this \u201cBig Four of Thrash\u201d nonsense. Megadeth and Slayer would remain, along with these Bay Area titans. There is not one song here which Exodus will allow me to skip once the disc starts to spin - this will hopefully put a smile on your face and an ache in your neck as the metal thrashing madness fills the air. A killer comeback album after a hefty twelve year absence of new material. There is something extra special about this album - and that is the band themselves.\n\nI shall explain further. Every instrument on this album has its own unique sound that cannot be found on any other work of music. Tom Hunting\u2019s drumming is more technical than it ever has been - and what stands out on this album is the razor sharp double-bass drumming, in machine gun bursts of about three or four every so often. If it was continued for longer durations, it would easily have a Mr Sandoval knocking knees at a similar pace - (just check the relentless \u201cWar is My Shepherd\u201d).\n\nThe work of the axemen Holt and Hunolt is just brilliant. They have their own sound, unmatched by almost any album released in 2004. There are loads of hammer-ons and pull-offs scattered throughout riffs in the album - the best example featured right from the mammoth opener with \u201cScar Spangled Banner\u201d. And as for the solos!\n\nGibson\u2019s bass work is impeccable, especially to be able to match the work of founding member Holt and his counterpart. Now we come to the singing of Souza. It is in traditional Exodus style, and once you are accustomed to its uniqueness you will be disappointed with any new Exodus material that sounds any different.\n\nI am extremely reluctant to hear any newer material due to the loss of Hunting, Hunolt and Souza. However, if the song material is anywhere near that of TOTD, I would probably recommend it. Just buy this album first.\n",
        "\nAaaaaaarghhhhhh!!!! This live album is fantastic!! This is the second live album Exodus recorded after the good \u201cGood Friendly, Violent Fun\u201d but this one is definitely their best. After \u201cForce Of Habit\u201d album they decided to stop for awhile and after 5 years they came back with this incredible power demonstration. \nThis live I think is the best one I\u2019ve ever listened to. The production is simply great, even if we are in 1997 and still nowadays some live albums don\u2019t sound so aggressive and powerful. This is perfection.\n\nThe band, with their classic line-up, plays like never before. They are incredibly fast, heavy as fuck and with a great production. Let me say that this one is not modified in a fucking studio; you can hear it\u2026the guitars wall of sound is huge; the drumming is restless, always fast, extremely thrash.\nTo give you an idea of the sound, imagine the great production of \u201cForce Of Habit\u201d album in a live version.\n\nThis album contains all the classics by Exodus, the old ones. Already from the intro to the first song \u201cBonded By Blood\u201d, you can understand this won\u2019t be a normal, classic live album. The crowd is crazy and Paul Baloff is a great entertainer, talking to them and sometimes he is incredibly funny like in the introduction to \u201cPiranha\u201d\u2026: \u201cThe next song is about fish\u2026sh\u2026and it ain\u2019t about no gold fish\u2026\u201d and so on for other kinds of fish\u2026amazing. His voice is raw, dirty, still childish\u2026in a word, the perfect singer for Exodus. Sometimes like in \u201cAnd There Was None\u201d he also modifies some vocal parts, making them even more powerful and bad-ass.\n\nIt\u2019s incredible how the songs sound so violent, but most of all, how they sound so similar to the albums. Seems like listening to a re-recorded version of their early works.\nHere we only have songs from Bonded By Blood and Pleasure Of The Flesh albums, so their best efforts in my opinion.\n\nEvery song, as I said before is incredibly similar to the studio ones but if I had to choose some of them, I\u2019d choose surely \u201cPiranha\u201d, \u201cDeliver Us To Evil\u201d, \u201cSeeds Of Hate\u201d, \u201cA Lesson In Violence\u201d and \u201cStrike of The Beast\u201d. I don\u2019t want to say that the other ones are less good (how could I say a thing like that for an album like this??), I mean only that they are the true classics even if the other songs are just amazing!\n\nA live album like this, made of passion, sweat (I can only image how much\u2026) and fucking thrash, is unique and belongs to the history, men\u2026no jokes. Fucking Exodus\u2026What a live panzer\u2026\n",
        "\nI just got into Exodus but I felt like listening to their demos anyway. And this one is not their best, that's for sure.\n\nThe songwriting seems to be there, and I say seems because sometimes you cannot tell what is going on. The only thing that is actually audible are the guitars. Seriously, I don't know if that thing in the background is a vocalist or not. He seems to be there, but you don't really know.\n\nAnd I know that this is a demo, but I think that there is a limit concerning the production level that cannot be surpassed. Most demos have crappy production, but it's ok considering they are demos. But this one just goes too far, since you can't hear what the fuck the drummer is doing, for example.\n\nThe riffs are there and most of them slay, but they are incredibly muffled. The bass is kind of there, and the vocalist is non-existent at best. Forget about the drums, they are incredibly low in the mix. The only thing that can be heard here are the guitars, and nothing else. Also, the lead play is crappy to say the least.\n\nThe potential is there, but these guys could and did get better, luckily.\n\nAlso notable is Die By His Hand, featuring a bunch of riffs \"borrowed\" later by Metallica. Seems those guys stole their whole career from other bands, but that's another story...\n\nRecommended only to people who meet these two conditions: 1. extreme die-hard fans of the band, 2.can tolerate very shitty productions.\n",
        "\nWhen a band finally releases new music after a 12 year hiatus, there is going to be some tension on what the material will sound like. In the case of Exodus, when it was announced that Steve Souza would be returning to the fold for vocal duties most people\u2019s hopes skyrocketed on whether or not they would just take up where they had left off. As it turns out, Exodus not only returned in top shape but in better shape then they had left in. \n\n\u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d is a modern thrash masterpiece. Not quite the old thrash sound of the 1980s, Exodus does play a style that is very close to that. A modern production really brings Exodus up to date with most of the other bands but their attitude and energy feel as though this album could have followed up \u201cBonded By Blood.\u201d \n\nGary Holt\u2019s guitar work has stepped up the notch since we last heard the band in 1992. Exodus\u2019 groove oriented sound is still in the mix on \u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d but this time there is a significant amount of thrash added. Most of the thrash influence is heard in the chaotic and technical solos and leads on the album. The heavy groove inspired riffs still have some great thrash injection in them and Gary Holt is one of the most talented riff writers in the industry.\n\nThe bass work is well played but unfortunately (and in a very thrash manner) the bass just follows the guitars for the most part. It helps that there is a heavy groove to the album so the bass does have moments where it directs the music during the solos and longer leads. The drums, courtesy of Tom Hunting, are a great combination of variety and simplicity. There are not a lot of technical areas in the drum work but the simplicity of the playing benefits the overall feeling of the album. It\u2019s a case where less is indeed more. \n\nHaving Steve Souza return for the vocals is a wonderful thing. Not that Paul Baloff (R.I.P.) was a bad vocalist, but Souza is probably the perfect Exodus vocalist. His combination of snarling and harsh barking is very unique and it\u2019s a welcome sound to hear him sing with Exodus again. It should also be mentioned that the lyrical writing of \u201cTempo of the Damned\u201d has also been stepped up. Rather than the tongue in cheek humor that Exodus had been using, the lyrics take a step towards social and political issues. Not to mention a good lesson in violent fun to the mix. \n\nExodus is certainly back with a vengeance. The combination groove and thrash along with a serious side and a reunion line-up is unstoppable on this album. Fans of both newer and older Exodus are going to enjoy this album.\n\nSongs to check out: Scar Spangled Banner, Blacklist, Impaler.\n",
        "\nDespite how low key Exodus has become in the last decade or so, the reunion album, Tempo of the Damned was an amazing feat in thrash revival and even though Steve Souza did leave Exodus (again) the band continues on. Releasing their latest effort, Shovel Headed Kill Machine, Exodus has grounded their rebirth as one of thrash titans in the industry.\n\nGranted this album is more groove oriented than Tempo of the Damned and the new singer has more modern thrash vocals. So this isn't a \"true\" return to old school thrash. It still is one of the best newer thrash albums to be released in the last 5 years. As newer thrash bands try to cross that boundary between death metal and thrash, bands like Exodus really keep it true.\n\nIt's nice to know that great guitar writers like Gary Holt are still around to show us that even in metal - the guitars can be both heavy and catchy. His ability to blend speed, brutality, and hooks into his riff work is some of the best in the metal world and Shovel Headed Kill Machine has some of his catchiest riffs yet. Unfortunately, many of the songs in general blend together and the guitar work could use a few more changes in tempo and sound to be truly brilliant. A little too consistent for my tastes. The riffs are a lot crunchier than before too - there is a lot of bottom to the guitar tone that makes it sound a lot heavier. The solos and leads are well written and played but I didn't find myself just in awe of either.\n\nThe bass lines are heavy as hell on this album. The bass is still pretty latched onto the guitar lines for the album and it would have been amazing to hear the bass throw a little character into its presence. It's well played and mixed but overall the bass is a tad stale.\n\nThe drums are brutal on this album. Positively and awesomely heavy. The double bass is killer on the album (and even though I'm not a fan of double bass a lot in thrash - it works on this album quite well). The diversity could have been a little better but the sheer force of the drums makes up for much of the technicality issues.\n\nRob Dukes (replacing Steve Souza after he left) does a fine job as a vocalist on Shovel Headed Kill Machine. He fits the style of the album well but I can understand where people are pulling the post thrash comments from. He has more of a barking style than previous Exodus vocalists and this does lead to a more \"modern\" thrash sound for the band. His vocals can tap that older thrash vibe (see \"Raze\" on the album) but overall he does have a unique set of pipes that makes him memorable.\n\nThis album isn't quite as good as their last - although they are different in many ways. This presents a newer thrash sound for Exodus with an older style attitude mixed in. Too bad the guitars are a little too heavy for the writing but its older style mix is a little too hard not to like.\n\nSongs to check out: Raze, Deathamphetamine, 44 Magnum Opus.\n",
        "\nThis is a public service message to those of you kvlt kiddies who think you\u2019re evil because you know who Ildjarn is: Paul Baloff is more metal than you. And if you don\u2019t acknowledge this proven fact, you run the risk of having your wife being raped and murdered, your town plundered, your home burned to the ground, and your bare flesh cut to the bone with a rusty knife. He will teach you a lesson in violence you won\u2019t soon forget, and the pleasure of watching you die is what he will get. He loves to stab his victims until they\u2019re dead \u2013 a knife to the throat or a smashing blow to the head. If you don\u2019t surrender, you\u2019ll breathe your final breath. You won\u2019t hear a sound \u2018til the knife is in your back. Thank you.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter that he\u2019s dead \u2013 he\u2019s metal\u2019s version of Chuck Norris, a guy who would bleed metal if that was at all possible. His vocals played a very large role in shaping this thrash classic into what it is. Can you spell \u201cbadass\u201d? It\u2019s spelled B-A-L-O-F-F.\n\nThe other instruments all seem mashed into one giant speeding ball of thrash \u2013 not that that\u2019s a bad thing, but Baloff\u2019s vocals stand out, just for their sheer hysteria. Awesome/ridiculous vocals notwithstanding, what Exodus have created here is one of the best thrash debut albums in the business. \n\nMusically, it\u2019s very similar Metallica\u2019s first (Metal Command = Motorbreath, A Lesson in Violence = Phantom Lord, etc.), but Bonded by Blood is a little more vicious, a little meaner, and has a rare sense of what exactly causes people\u2019s heads to bang. It sounds like Kill \u2018Em All\u2019s big, mean, red-headed half-sister went out and drank a few shots.\n\nAnother similarity between the two is the production. Kill \u2018Em All\u2019s energy-pumped twin guitars are replicated here, along with the same smashing drums. It has a very raw, live feel, almost as if these guys were pounding it out in a very nice garage.\n\nThe last similarity between these two seminal albums is the solos. Maybe we should have expected that, because Kirk taught Gary Holt how to play, but it still sounds like Kirk is playing these solos \u2013 and I\u2019m sure he wrote some of them. Most of the solos on here ape his fast and frantic hammer-on style, and do so competently enough, I guess. But the main attraction here, as with Metallica, is the riffs, not the solos.\n\nThe rhythm section is competent, not bad, but Araya and Lombardo aren\u2019t exactly quivering in their boots either. Rob McKillop\u2019s bass gets buried, and while it still provides the rhythmic backbone that it\u2019s supposed to be, it\u2019s not a feature. And Hunting isn\u2019t exactly a genius, simply a solid drummer.\n\nThe thing about this album is that, at its metal heart, it\u2019s just a bunch of San Francisco teens having a good time. And those good times they had 22 years ago, still translate to the listener.\n",
        "\nWhen \u2018Impact Is Imminent\u2019 came out some reviewers back in 1990 were not all too positive. However I bought it anyway. Of course it was almost impossible to write a worthy follow-up to the mighty \u2018Fabulous Disaster\u2019, but \u2018Impact\u2026\u2019 wasn\u2019t all that bad. Just like its predecessor the album was once again filled with riff after riff only this time the average song was lenghtier. Uptempo thrashers like the titletrack and \u2018Thrash Under Pressure\u2019 are nothing less than great and pounders \u2018Lunatic Parade\u2019 and \u2018Objection Overruled\u2019 are plain excellent Exodus superiority. \u2018Within the Walls of Chaos\u2019 did have some grooving parts which were somewhat new to their sound but the storyline of the song and the very excellent chorus made this a really good song. \u2018Changing of the Guard\u2019 had some excellent thrashing moments and the chorus of \u2018A.W.O.L.\u2019 is typical quality Exodus. \n\nSo what was it that made this album a bit less interesting than its predecessors? For me the production. The guitars are too prominently mixed in and their sound is somewhat over the top. With a guitar production like this all other instruments tend to get snowed under. Most annoying however are the drums. The sound of the snaredrum is the worst part of the production, sounding like a tin can with too much reverb at times. Please do not focus too much on this because if you do, it really starts to irritate. Tempesta however is - of course - a decent drummer but I did miss Hunting\u2019s creativity and typical style. As always the bassguitar is hardly present. Zetro is once again at his best here (\u2018Lunatic Parade\u2019, \u2018Objection Overruled\u2019).\n\nNope, there is actually not much wrong with \u2018Impact Is Imminent\u2019. Only their previous albums were just better, making people forget this one. Today many new thrash acts however would (and should!) sell their souls to get the ability to write an album like this.\n",
        "\nThere have always been two elements that made Exodus one of the greater classic eighties thrash bands. First of all of course the riffs. Mr Gary Holt has his own definite style within the boundaries of the genre. Secondly and equally important, characteristic vocals! You may think whatever you must about Baloff and Zetro. They both had their own individual sound. And a characteristic vocalist is something you needed to get your own own face in the scene and to put the icing on the cake. Their first three albums are classics for me but I also really like \u2018Impact\u2019, \u2018Force\u2019 and \u2018Tempo\u2019. (and not forgetting the briliant \u2018Another Lesson in Violence\u2019 live album) \nI will now explain the three main reasons why \u2018Shovel\u2019 is a huge dissappointment for this once proud Exodus fan and how it turned out to become the only Exodus album I gave away for free! \nExodus want to be and want to be called a thrash metal band. Because that is what they once were and what made them famous. Therefor everything they write and release will of course be compared to their best material from the classic eighties thrash metal period. That brings us to this: \n\nOn \u2018Shovel Headed Kill Machine\u2019 the guitars are more \u2018Gary\u2019 than everything the band released after \u2018Fabulous Disaster\u2019. This of course is a good thing, but compositionally not many songs on \u2018Shovel\u2019 come close to the quality of the holy Exodus trinity \u2018Bonded...\u2019, \u2018Pleasures...\u2019 and \u2018Fabulous...\u2019. Simply because they are not that catchy. Yet one cannot deny the quality of songs like \u2018Deathamphetamine\u2019 and \u2018Raze\u2019. \n\nSecondly the modern production doesn\u2019t really do it for me. Just like punk, if thrash metal sounds too clean, it simply sounds unconvincing. Thrash metal must have a thrash metal attitude and atmosphere surrounding it. You must \u2018hear\u2019 the sweat, the moshing, the diving, the drinking, the jeans, the sneakers. This is lacking since the production has a certain surgical tightness and sterilised sound. Anyway, considering the above, it still could have been a decent album. \n\nBut the third and probably most important thing ruining every chance of \u2018Shovel\u2019 being a decent Exodus album is some fat bearded bloke called Rob Dukes. This guy does not look thrash metal, he reeks of groove en nu-metal mediocitry. There can be no such thing as these horrid beards in thrash metal (that goes for Kerry King as well!), nor should stupid hardcore hats be allowed. \nBut apart from his appearance and stage pressence it\u2019s the vocal perfomance that really counts on an album. And that is even more painful! Is it bad? Not really\u2026.for a young demo band. It is memorable enough? No. It is plain boring. I get the feeling Exodus were not willing to take the risk of chosing a new characteristic vocalist. Simply because characterictic vocals will always have a big effect on your sound. A good team without a good forward player might still be good but never score\u2026.Exodus took the supposedly safe path through the middle with a vocalist that sings neither good nor bad and just fills the space. How many times I listened to the album, I could not find nor remember any charateristics in his sound. He simply does not stand out! He just screams his way through the album just for the sake of having some words on it. This man sounds so bloody average he should never be allowed to sing for a major league thrash metal band again. \n\nSo you see, three elements that wreck what could have been a great album. What a shame.\n",
        "\nClearly, some people didn't get the comeback they wanted with Tempo of the Damned, so Exodus promised that Shovel-Headed Kill Machine would up the ante on attitude and brutality. It certainly does that, but it does have its drawbacks. There's the lingering question of whether Exodus should throw in the towel at this point or not; if you were to judge based solely on this album, the answer would be \"Hell no! They're just getting started!\" But, compared to the classic Exodus albums, SHKM is only halfway there.\n\nI'll start by saying that the aggression has made a big comeback to the band's sound. Maybe not in a way we were expecting, but it beats the passive nature of Tempo of the Damned. There are plenty of rapid-fire assaults powered by Paul Bostaph's powerhouse drumming and charging guitar lines, but there are also the dirty, mid-paced and snide mid-paced songs as well. This, however, is where the album fails in some aspects. Songs like \"Altered Boy,\" while certainly catchy, push the limits of how far these things can be pushed before walking a fine line of tedious songwriting and the rehashing of ideas. The fairly predictable song formulas don't help matters; each song, even the barnburning numbers, follow a typical thrash formula: intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus, etc. Occasionally the intro riffs are repeated at later points, which only gives listeners a sense of, \"When the HELL will this song be finished?\" Generally these types of things aren't a problem with thrash/speed metal, because most songs are a decent and listenable length. Unfortunately, Gary Holt got a little too ambitious in his writing and had the grand idea that he could compose an Exodus album with the epic scope of ...And Justice for All. \"Deathamphetamine\" clocks in at almost nine minutes, but it easily could have been four or five. (St. Anger, anyone?)\n\nWith this aside, the core of each song is a huge step up from Tempo of the Damned. Gary's riffs and solos are some of the meanest he's composed in years, and the chemistry of the band is ten times tighter than anything we've seen from the band. Songs like \"Going Going Gone\" and \"Now Thy Death Day Come\" are where the band truly shine with skull-bashing palm-muted riffs, shredding leads, and machine-gun double bass. Some moments hearken to more old-school territory, such as \"Shudder to Think,\" but the majority of the work done here is the new and fierce face of Exodus. Paul's drumming once again proves him to be a thrashing machine, as seen on the mile-a-minute title track. Rob's introduction to the band helps bring back the snide and crass edge to the vocals, but also brings degree of brutality to the sound. His rough, gutteral shouts beat out the old-school vocals in attitude, even though he tries out some clean vocals every now and then. Unfortunately, his performance is somewhat brought down by Gary's cheesy lyrics. It seems like Gary tried to recapture the essence of the old-school Exodus in the lyrics, but it comes off as nothing more than juvenile tough-guy talk. Every line rhymes in a very annoying manner: \"Washed up, washed out/What more can I say?/You better start filling out your resume.\" That's taken from \"Shudder to Think.\" But it only gets better from there... Not. \"Altered Boy\" is pseudo-political with its stance on the recent troubles in the Catholic church, and \"Deathamphetamine\" is pretty self-explanatory. Exodus need to be a fucking thrash band, not some twats delivering politically correct messages. Hell, most of the lyrics are downright laughable.\n\nFortunately, the conviction in the music is enough to cover up for it, and the production on the album is incredible. The guitar tone is massive and thick, with enough treble to cut through the mix. Paul's drums have a deep, punchy sound to them, but have a modern-day control to them that helps things out in the long run. The bass has the signature Exodus sound; sharp and clear, without losing the grit it needs to maintain the nature of everything. \n\nIf you can deal with the more boring moments of the album and the slight cheese factors, Shovel-Headed Kill Machine is mean and ferocious as hell. \n\nFavorite tracks: \"Deathamphetamine,\" \"Shudder to Think,\" \"Now Thy Death Day Come,\" \"Shovel Headed Kill Machine.\"\n",
        "\nI could never understand the hype and the fervency that surrounds this album.\nIt has some decent moments, some killer parts, but a shitload of poor riffs and uninteresting vocals and lead guitars. I don't hate this album, I like half of it but not really so much that I consider it to be \"one of the best albums ever\". It's really not such dominant or outstanding, I don't feel anything special when I put this cd or when I play the riffs on my guitar. It's just has some nice riffs here and there but really nothing more.\n\nThe title track begins with unnecessary silent wind, or something which sounds close. Then the guitar comes in and the main riff repeat himself for TOO LONG. It's quite boring to hear the same riff over and over again for almost the whole song. There are maybe three riffs in all this song, the main one drags almost all the song, there is another one under the solo which sounds improvised and uninteresting and the riff in the chorus is average, but nothing more. The vocals sounds dirty and tough, but they just fits well the songs and doesn't increase something outstanding, they kinda average. All in all it could be much better song if they were trying to develop it a bit, it's becoming repetitive and dull when you stuck with the same riff for the whole song.\n\n\"Exodus\" is a better track. The chorus is catchy and raw, the vocals more biting, the riffs aren't boring and the lead guitar sounds fresh and intensive. \"A Lesson In Violence\" is a decent one. It sounds a bit repetitive but it has a brutal mood in it and the track name really describes well how the song sounds. What ruins it are the lame solos which sounds like they were improvising some randomly notes on high speed and tried to break the speed of sound ...Jesus...it sounds so lame! Whats the point with writing a cool rhythm and then to fuck up the whole song with a goofy solos which sounds like 7 years old wrote by himself?\n\n\"Deliver Us To Evil\" is a longer and more varied song, maybe the best one in this album. It has some sudden notes which sounds pretty good and some tempo changes here and there. It has a lot more riffs then the other songs and it has a nice groove and it's a really enjoyable track. The rest of the songs sounds average in the better case, and repetitive and boring in the worst case.\n\nSo, is it such a perfect album? Hell no! As I said there is a shitload of futile riffs which doesn't makes you feel anything and these lead guitars sounds like they wrote it two days before recording the album, saying the least ...\nThe vocals average, doesn't exciting or too much aggressive, the drumming sounds ok, the production is alright...actually I couldn't find anything which makes this album to become more than average. While listening to this album I can't fell something outstanding that never done before [or after] the album came out.\nIt isn't mind-blowing, groundbreaking nor special in any way. I often thinks here and there that \"Hey! that's a nice kicking ass riff!\" but nothing more. So it has some better tracks but some boring tracks, that's would have been 50 or so, but I decided to give it 61 because it was only 1983 or 1984 when they wrote most of the songs here, that's means they still did something different and weren't just imitation of their favorite bands. But seriously, this is what people calls perfection? Give me a break...\n",
        "\nLike several other \"legendary\" bands, my first experience with Exodus was when they released a new album, that being \"Shovel-Headed Kill Machine.\" Nearly every review that I read said that this was \"a return to thrash roots\" or \"as good as their older material,\" which I foolishly believed. This belief actually led me to putting off purchasing the older Exodus albums because I assumed that they were all this bad (I later heard some old Souza and Baloff material and realized the error of my ways).\n\nSo why is this album so bad? Several things. The biggest is the production; Andy Sneap mixed the album but the production is handled by Holt, as opposed to \"Tempo of the Damned\" which was produced by Sneap. The change in sound is instantly perceptible; the bass is in the forefront, a major gaffe because not only does the bass sound terrible, Jack Gibson does nothing remotely interesting on his instrument. In fact, he actually hurts songs like \u201cDeathamphetamine\u201d with that overstated sound. \n\nAlso, the rhythm guitars are tuned poorly, down-tuned far more than necessary. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that the riffs, ranging from groove-sounding slow to moderately fast, are incredibly bland. Certainly nothing that hasn\u2019t been done before, and when it was done before, it was much more attention-grabbing. There are really only two riffs that I can remember being worthwhile, one after the solo in \u201cDeathamphetamine\u201d and one in the middle of \u201cNow Thy Death Day Come.\u201d The fast parts in \u201cRaze\u201d and \u201c.44 Magnum Opus\u201d are nice, but nothing special. Even the fast opening and surprising break in the title track aren\u2019t enough to save it.\n\nAnd while Rob Dukes isn\u2019t a terrible vocalist, he isn\u2019t anything extraordinary either. He has an annoying habit of putting emphasis on the \u201cow\u201d sound in any word such as \u201cdown,\u201d \u201cground,\u201d or \u201caround.\u201d And the lyrics are atrocious; yeah Zetro\u2019s lyrics weren\u2019t much better, and were filled with puns much worse than \u201cDeathamphetamine,\u201d but he sang them with such conviction that they were actually enjoyable. Dukes is just too one-dimensional and lacks any sort of personality other than tough-guy yelling.\n\nThe only two positive aspects of this album are the lead guitar and the drumming. Gary Holt and Lee Altus are spectacular soloists, and pretty much every song contains a lead by both of them. We all know Paul Bostaph from his days doing a fantastic job taking over for Dave Lombardo in Slayer, and here his performance is just as impressive. His drumming, while fast and technical, also has a sort of spontaneity that is lacking in many other modern drummers.\n\nUnfortunately, these two highlights are not enough to justify the purchase of this album. Yeah, it\u2019s Exodus and yeah it isn\u2019t nu-metal, but this album is disappointing all the same. Don\u2019t listen to all the ass-kissers who rate this album highly, because they are dead wrong. Download the first two tracks if possible, but save your money for something more worthwhile.\n",
        "\nThrash is genre that lately seems to be giving people some trouble, for reasons I cannot fathom. All manner of bands (mostly of the mainstream metalcorish variety) get that label just because they have fast songs. This is, I think, mostly because somebody told the VH1 crew that Metalica's old stuff was called thrash and since we all know that the best way to get a band some credibility is to call them the next Metallica, thrash began to be just another word for \"this band is totally heavier that Slipknot and will be the defining metal band for decades to come or at least until next week when when we find a new band to hype.\"\n\nIf any of you have found yourselves confused by this new (and mistaken) definition of thrash, allow me to point you to Bonded By Blood, which is the textbook example of what thrash was, is, and ever will be. Harsh, fast, abrasive, violent - in short, everything thrash is supposed to sound like. Listen and weep, Shadows Fall kiddies - because this shit is PERFECT.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing to fault this album for. You might make the case that there are better vocalists than Paul - and this is true - but I can't think of anyone whose voice would have worked nearly as well with this music. Sure there are more talented and showy bassists than Rob, but he and Hunting provide the perfect backing for the guitarwork. And WHAT guitarwork! You will find some of the most amazing riffs on this album including the opening riff of the title track, which I will go so far as to call the greatest riff of all time. Yep, folks, that's it - the pinnacle of riff-writing achievement. In 21 years as of this review, nobody has come up with a riff that slays quite like that one does.\n\nAside from song tempos, which range from fast to blisteringly fast, here's not much variety on this album, but there doesn't need to be. After all, why bother fucking around when you've already achieved perfection? It's all brutal, mean, catchy riffs, unforgettable choruses (\"And Then There Were None\" and \"Piranha\" come to mind), blazing solos, and of course Paul Baloff's frenzied shrieks, which, by the way, waste no time on the teen-angst that seems to be so popular in modern \"thrash\" lyrics (*cough*Slayer'sGodHatesUsAll*cough*), and instead focus on such things as raping and murdering your wife. We do get a brief respite in the acoustic intro to \"No Love,\" but other than that, it's more or less a 40+ minute-long skullfucking that you'll never forget.\n\nIf you do not worship this album, there is something wrong with you.\n",
        "\nThis album was the product of Exodus' reunion in 1997 with 4/5ths of the line-up from their highly acclaimed debut, Bonded By Blood.\n\nIt was the first show of their American reunion tour, and has a fantastic sound. The sound courtesy of Andy Sneap is very heavy, and the mix is superbly done. That is one of the finest qualities of this album, with other live albums (especially more modern ones) I repeatedly find that the album sounds like it has been tampered with too much in the studio, and consequently lose that live feeling. Megadeth's Rude Awakening is a perfect example. This album definitely finds the right balance.\n\nThe setlist for this album is near perfect, with it consisting of the entire Bonded By Blood album, along with three tracks from Pleasures Of The Flesh and one of Exodus' demo-era tracks, Impaler.\n\nThe highlights are definitely Bonded By Blood, and the three tracks off Pleasures. Bonded's classic chorus comes off just as good live, and it's great hearing the three Pleasures... tracks with some decent fucking production.\n\nThe band's playing here is absolutely flawless, which is impressive considering the apparently rehearsed only twice. The guitar work, as one would expect from the H-Team, is fantastic, with the H-Team delivering their solos note-for-note. Jack Gibson's bass playing sticks faithfully to how Rob McKillop played these songs, which is following the guitars pretty much all the time. He does have a nice smooth bass tone though, which is particularly noticeable on Brain Dead and Pleasures Of The Flesh. Tom Hunting's drumming is also top-notch, and his drums sound fantastic. The kick drums sound thick and full, but still come through very clear, as does the snare. Sometimes I think Sneap's work in the studio annoys me, but this album sounds great. \n\nPaul Baloff's performance is memorable, and his vocals are spot on and his comments in-between the songs are hilarious. Things such as \"I'd like the thank Gary, Tom, Jack and Rick for letting me be so heavy\" and \"This one's older than shit and heavier than time; this one's called Impaler!\" It sounds cheesy in words, but ireally gives the album an awesome touch. There is also a guest performance from Robb Flynn on A Lesson In Violence, which I guess is cool if you're a Machine Head fan. You can't actually hear another guitar in the mix, so for the rest of us it doesn't matter. I didn't actually know until I read about it.\n\nThe only complaint I can think of is that Metal Command was absent and the setlist doesn't cover any of Exodus' material after 1986, but I'm really nitpicking here, since Paul Baloff didn\u2019t do vocals any Exodus material after Bonded By Blood.\n\nAnd there we have it folks, what I consider the best live album behind Unleashed In The Fucking East.\n\n(this was written in it's original form by me at http://www.sputnikmusic.com as Apocalyptic Raids)\n",
        "\nAh, the flavors of cheese swirl about in my mouth like an orgy of cheese... women...\n\nYeah...\n\nWhatever man, the title is the point. Spot on, Bay-Area Thrash titans Exodus have always held an embargo on the ass-kickery that is Thrash Metal. Sure, Destruction this, Sodom that, Kreator killed Jesus with a whiffle ball bat, but no other bands had as much raw energy and power as Exodus had. You can give me all that bullshit about evilness of Black Metal, and brutality of Death, but the fact of the matter is that during the older days of the reign of Thrash, Exodus ruled every ass and kicked every pregnant woman in the stomach world-over. \"Another Lesson In Violence,\" which was the last Baloff-featured album ever, will forever live as the best live album for a number of reasons.\n\nNumber one, sound quality. Too often, bands like to think that they can space on live quality and pretty much deliver shitty sounding music. Along with Overkill, Exodus decided to do something better for the fans than just hand us a pile of under-produced trash and call it essential listening for any Exodus fan. No, the guitar his is thick and fucking crunchy, like Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch. The drum sound is pungent and potent, with the bass audible enough to provide a dynamic palette for the band to work off of.\n\nNumber two, Baloff, for all his odd vocal work, is absolutely amazing on this album. His gall bladder must be giving him hell with those bile-drenched vocal chords, and he sounds absolutely biting here, but in the same sense that Bon Scott sounded for AC/DC; very complementary to the music. It's also great to hear him adding a sense of humor to the already rocking music. Listen closely before the solo in the Thrash classic \"Piranha,\" you can hear the band shout: \"Everybody dies! REDRUM!\" In the context of the song, it's enough time to die laughing before you get kicked the FUCK out by the steel-toed asskickery boots of THRASH.\n\n\"Give it up! This ain't no Arsenio Hall show, DESTROY SOMETHING! AND NOW YOU HAVE THE CHANCE!\"\n\nClassic.\n\nThird, and lastly, H & H are at the peak of their performance here. If there's a mistake, it's turned into a psyke! Most of the time, they blaze through songs, upping the tempo on already maddening music. The leadwork is absolutely phenominal. Extended rhythm bridges for squealing and searing solos that could teach John Petrucci a thing or two about relevancy.\n\nAll in all, \"Another Lesson in Violence\" should be the standard of live recording, and it perfectly illustrates the ferocity of the mightiest Bay Area Thrashers, Exodus.\n",
        "\nFor the follow-up to 2004\u2019s Tempo of the Damned, band leader and main songwriter Gary Holt substituted almost his entire supporting cast, bringing in two Metal all-stars in drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Lee Altus, as well as a fairly unknown singer called by the name of Rob Dukes. We all know what Bostaph and Altus can do on their respective instruments (the drumming on Shovel is particularly stellar), and Dukes ain\u2019t no slouch either. His voice is pretty similar to Zetro\u2019s, maybe not quite as instantly recognizable, but still very solid \u2013 the guy is definitely a worthy addition to the line-up.\n\nHowever, Exodus have always been primarily Gary Holt\u2019s baby, and Shovel Headed Kill Machine proves it: despite the radical overhaul in the personnel department, this album is the logical continuation of its predecessor, and it\u2019s still 100% Exodus.\n\nIn terms of songwriting and production, this isn\u2019t much different from Tempo, with the exception that Shovel is overall faster and more aggressive. It seems like with Tempo, Gary first had to reassure himself that he could still do it before he could accomplish the solid slab of Thrash that is Shovel. The new album simply sounds tighter and more self-confident, whereas Tempo often sounded a bit too restrained for my taste and also had some filler material.\n\nThere are no actual weak songs on Shovel, everything sounds very homogeneous from start to finish. The only downside is that there are no instant \u201chits\u201d this time, no songs that really stand out from the rest. Whereas Tempo had instant favorites like \u201cWar Is My Shepherd\u201d or \u201cBlacklist,\u201d Shovel is a record that has to be listened to in its entirety to be really appreciated. Anyway, the extra speed and ferocity easily make up for the lack of catchiness.\n\nThe production is yet again very crisp and heavy, although I do have a minor bone to pick with the guitars \u2013 they sound a bit too low, a bit too down-tuned for my taste. This is particularly noticeable on \u201cAltered Boy,\u201d but it\u2019s really the whole album that would have benefitted from a less modern, more \u201ctraditional\u201d guitar sound. Apart from that little flaw, though, the production is pretty much impeccable.\n\nThe bottom line is that Shovel Headed Kill Machine is a highly recommendable Thrash album. For those who were a bit disappointed by the prevalence of slower songs on Tempo of the Damned, the added speed and aggression on Shovel \u2013 for further evidence, see (among others) \u201cRaze,\u201d \u201cKarma\u2019s Messenger,\u201d \u201cGoing Going Gone,\u201d and the title track \u2013 is exactly what the doctor prescribed.\n\n\nChoicest cuts: \u201cRaze,\u201d \u201cDeathamphetamine\u201d (eight-and-a-half minutes long, but never gets boring), \u201cKarma\u2019s Messenger,\u201d \u201cShudder to Think\u201d (the catchiest song to be found here, very reminiscent of \u201cBlacklist\u201d from Tempo of the Damned), \u201cGoing Going Gone,\u201d and \u201cShovel Headed Kill Machine\u201d (now this is really fast\u2026); even the bonus track of the digipack version, \u201cPurge the World,\u201d is quite excellent\u2026\n",
        "\nThis is the only slab of official live recordings youll get with the almighty Steve Souza(probably the best) singer of Exodus. You get a decent amount of music here recorded pretty well from the 1989 \"Fabulous DIsaster\" Tour. Therefore, four of these eight songs featured here are on that subsequent album, making it sort of unbalanced discography wise. Personally, the cover of AC/DC's \"Dirty Deeds\" is a throwaway track, I would have rather heard an original song here. Also, this gets a lower review rating than it should due to the track listing and the fact that they should just have made it a fucking full length. You got about 36 minutes of music here with the bullhsit banter thrown out, so I dont know why this didnt make the cut as an LP. Steve does a good job of getting the crowd going, though at times the audience doesnt sound like it was matched up to this concert, but IT IS A LIVE RECORDING. A bonus for drummer-philes is the first time call up of John Tempesta to the drumkit, filling in for a sick Tim Hunting. As expected, the thrash bveteran lives up to his reputation and does a solid job subbing for Tim. Set wise, you have the main portion of this coming from Disaster era, so ofd course Toxic Waltz is on it. The best surprise might be Cajun Hell, as they pull off the blues harmonies from the studio version pretty well on here. Chemi-Kill and Braindead are also strong renditions. So bascially, this is a cool ep only for Exodus fans, but a good way for a newcomer to check out tracks that were on the overlooked but solid \"\"Pleasures of the Flesh \" album. If I had to pick between this and \"Another Lesson in Violence\", I'd take the latter as the more solid purchase, but this is recommended for the Souza freaks out there.\n",
        "\nThe first Exodus demo from '82 with Kirk Hammett. Production-wise this is absolutely awful, the guitar and bass are way too loud, the vocals are muffled, and the drums sound like they were recorded from down the street. However, that doesn't take away from the overflowing energy and catchiness of this awesome early display of Exodus.\n\nWhipping Queen - Opens with a really nice NWOBHM-ish guitar harmony, which is played over a catchy as hell verse. The driving chorus is very bangworthy, with Tom Hunting's cymbals really accenting the guitar nicely. Shitloads of energy here: the rhythm section is a fucking freight train, Baloff is unrestrained as usual, and check out the early version of the trademark Exodus gang vocals (a little more high-pitched, less aggressive, probably because of that little girl Hammett, ahuh huh) shouting the chorus - \"She always gets what she wants!\" Good thrashing times had by all.\n\nDeath and Domination - Again, a catchy as fuck chorus with more of those energetic (albeit slightly squeeky!) gang vocals. Love the little guitar solo break near the end that seques into one last chorus.\n\nWarlords - As the other reviews have said, definitely the most thrashy song here. The first half of the song has plenty of chug-a-chug for the discerning thrasher, the verse riff really brings to mind the first Exumer album. The second half of the song is total Merciful Fate worship, with a slowed down part that leads into an awesome galloping section.\n\nDespite the production, short songs, and relative simplicity, I love the shit out of this demo. The songs here are undeniably catchy and the energy of these kids is self-evident. If only these songs hadn't been discarded when Exodus went full on thrash; I would love to have seen them benefit from a few more years experience and better production on Bonded By Blood or a pre-BBB EP. \n\nGet this!\n",
        "\nBoy, am I fucking sick of having an album be strongly recommended to me, then I get it and it\u2019s not as good as it was supposed to be. It\u2019s happened to me with Megadeth\u2019s The System Has Failed, with Death\u2019s The Sound Of Perseverance, and it happened with Tempo Of The Damned. Now this year, it happens again with yet another Exodus album. I knew I should\u2019ve bought Hazardous Mutation instead.\n\nI do have to give this some credit though; it\u2019s better than Tempo at least, and Rob Dukes has a much less annoying voice than Zetro. Plus some parts, like Karma\u2019s Messenger and the fast middle section of Deathamphetamine, are enjoyable. The main thing that bothers me about this though is that contrary to what most people say, it\u2019s not the heaviest Thrash album of the new millennium, nor is it the fastest. If anything, it actually sounds kind of like Slipknot. I\u2019m not even exaggerating. Shortly after I bought this album, I had Winamp going in the other room while I was doing something, and I heard a song playing that sounded like it was off this album. I then came back in the room and it was actually Slipknot\u2019s The Heretic Anthem (and yes, I do listen to some Slipknot when I\u2019m in the mood for it). Rob Dukes\u2019 voice is similar to Corey Taylor\u2019s screaming voice on Iowa, and the riffs are similar to some of Slipknot\u2019s heavier riffs.\n\nThe production is another thing that bothers me. It\u2019s loud enough, but the guitar tone is extremely bassy, which combined with the groovish riffs is not a good sign. Plus the bass guitar sounds like someone mashing on the deeper keys on an old piano in a predetermined rhythm for the entire duration of the album. The production also saps the power and energy of some of the moments, because it\u2019s kind of overproduced in parts. For example, listen to the beginning of I Am Abomination, just before the double-bass comes in. The drums come in, and are just kind of playing some beat, with not much emotion showing through. It feels pretty forced and generic. Overall the song is okay, but it could\u2019ve been so much more.\n\nThe most painful part of this album would have to be the midpaced, groove parts. Songs like Shudder To Think and Going Going Gone bring back memories of some of the midpaced groove parts on Tempo Of The Damned, which sounded extremely plodding and boring. Take Their Lives, this is not. The faster parts on this album though, like the previously mentioned middle section of Deathamphetamine, are great. At the 5:04 mark, everything suddenly gets fast as fuck, and in comes a great solo. Now if the entire album sounded like this, I would be orgasming so much my pants would be giving birth. The fast part damn near gets ruined at the 5:37 \u2013 5:43 section, when the headbanging flow gets interrupted by a short Fear Factory-ish stop-start section that is still somewhat fast, but it ends up just distracting from the riff before (and after). And I do like some Fear Factory as well, but it just does not fit with that fast riff. At all.\n\nThe riffage on this album, like other elements, is pretty generic overall. Occasionally the riffage is quality Thrash, but other times it sounds very groovish. The intro riff to Raze is a good example; it\u2019s extremely simple and dull and repetitive. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the verses and chorus are extremely catchy (plus the riff that plays under the solo), then Raze would be a shit song. The lyrics are catchy enough and seem well-written, which is one good thing about this album. Plus the front cover is just completely badass. But lyrics and cover art alone don\u2019t make an album good.\n\nIn the end, this album isn\u2019t completely and utterly horrible. I can listen to it and be somewhat entertained for the majority of the album, hence the rating isn\u2019t extremely low. What does annoy me though is that something this mediocre is being orgasmed over by nearly everyone as being the number 1 post-2000 Thrash album ever. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that great at all. If Lee Altus had had more of a part in the album than just playing solos, then I\u2019m sure this would\u2019ve been better. So if you\u2019re looking for something that is 100% pure unadulterated Thrash Metal, I suggest you look elsewhere. If on the other hand, you want something that resembles Thrash for the most part, but has noticeable Pantera and Slipknot influences and is overproduced, then get this album. Man, I should stop buying newer Exodus albums and just get Bonded By Blood and get it over with already.\n\nAnd because I can\u2019t think of anywhere else to say this, Deathamphetamine steals a riff from Destruction\u2019s The Antichrist album. Listen to the :58 mark of Deathamphetamine, then listen to the :09 mark of Dictators Of Cruelty. Exodus speed this up and play a note or two differently, but they still sound extremely similar. I think that\u2019s pretty bad.\n",
        "\nTempo of the Damned is the album that got me into Exodus in the first place, yes, I hadn't all heard all that much of them before, but when I heard Tempo of the Damned, it immediately became my favourite album of all time. This has changed since then, but back in 2003, it blew me away. \n\nScar Spangled Banner starts off the journey into Exodus's remade world of thrash. A great starting riff starts us off and the drums kick in, and you can't help but bang your head. Anyone who says this track (or this album for that matter) is no good just can't handle the fact that Exodus's sound has changed since its previous albums, it's cleaner, and Souza does have a little bit of a say, whiny tone to his voice. Now that I've listened to Shovel Headed Kill Machine about a hundred times, I don't appreciate Souza's voice as much. But you know what? He sings well, and the song is pure thrash, it's great. \"Red the beautiful colour of blood, flowing like a stream. White the colour of bleaching bone, lovely and obscene. Blue the bruising colour of flesh, battered ripped and torn. The colours of the flag of hate, of violence and porn.\" Now I'm not Anti-American or anything, but I must say that is pretty damn great. Oh ya, the solos are sweet too. \n\nWar Is My Sheppard is a track that is carried by Souza, the guitars are fast and the drums pounding, but Souza really does an excellent job on this track, his screams of \"WAR, WAR, WAR IS MY SHEPPARD\" are simply awesome. I must note that with about 20 seconds left in the song, the riff is a helluva lot more awesome then in the rest of the song. All in all, a fast song that carries the pace set by Scar Spangled Banner. \n\nBlacklist slows things down a bit, and although it might not exactly be deep and meaningful, it does have a pretty damn good intro. The riff is catchy, and the bass is quite a bit more audible on this track then on most of the others on the album. The solo on Blacklist is quite nice; it's definitely the best one up to this point on the album, although later on Shroud of Urine and Forward March, the solos surpass it. \n\nA review stated that Shroud of Urine sounded like wannabe black metal... I don't get it, I don't like that much black metal and don't listen to it too often, but I fail to see how this sounds like anything but thrash. The intro, wow, those drums sound great and the bass too. The riff is just amazing, and when the solo kicks in... sweet jesus. The lyrics are also great, \"You're crucifucked and your out of luck if you put your faith in the flock\", I mean, wow. The highlight of this song is definately the solo though, it's so nice, it just... fits perfectly. \n\nForward March. Definitely the best track on the album. This song was and might still be my favourite song of all time. It kicks in fast, and keeps on going, the gallops on the double bass are nice, the riff is awesome, Souza does a good job singing, although it's true it's almost rap like, but whatever, it's called change, I know some people might shun this as stupidity and wannabe rap metal, but I disagree. Oh well, to each his own. As the song reaches the 3 minute and 30 second mark.... well... it gets a whole lot more intense. This is perhaps the coolest instrumental part of a song I've ever heard, the solos are just mesmerizing, it's not like I'm listening to a song anymore, I feel like I'm being shown just how insanely good metal can get. This track changed life a little bit for me, and it's because of this that I decided Tempo of the Damned was my favourite album of all time. \n\nCulling the Herd is a good track, but after Forward March, it just doesn't seem up to the task of keeping the album at a constant pace. The solos are great, but the change in pace from the last track to this one is a little bit much, it would have been better put later on in the album, with some of the faster songs right after Forward March. If I listen to this track on its own, I tend to appreciate it so much more. \n\nSealed with a Fist. The pissed off honeymoon story. I like the track, although it's not quite on par with the first 6 tracks of the album, I think after Forward March the album drops off a little bit and doesn't really fulfill until the title track Tempo of the Damned. \n\nThrowing Down has some great vocal parts, and the cowbell is just great, it's hilarious. Not a bad track. \n\nI don't see what's so great about Impaler, I kind of find it the poorest track on the album. It has an awesome riff which does kind of remind one of Trapped Under Ice... it's fairly more old school, but I don\u2019t know, I don't really like Souza's voice on this one, I guess I'm kind of glad he got replaced on Shovel Headed Kill Machine. \n\nTempo of the Damned is slower paced then the other ones, I like the riff and Souza's voice. It's a good way to end off the album. \n\nThe ACDC cover is cool, but it's not on the regular edition of the album so I wasn't sure if I should say anything about it. Oh well, I love ACDC. \n\nAll in all, Tempo of the Damned was a huge comeback, it was an awesome comeback, I can't believe people don't approve, what are you looking for? Pleasures of the Flesh remake but keep shitty production? Jesus people, Tempo of the DAMNED, it's thrash! And you know what, Shovel Headed Kill Machine out thrashes this masterpiece in everyway, something which I never imagined possible.\n",
        "\nCall me crazy but I like this more than Tempo of the Damned which was surely the 2005 album of the year! Rick, Hunting and Zetro - three vintage members of Exodus have left leaving only Gary Holt from the original Exodus of yesteryear and Jack Gibson (bassist) picked up for Tempo Of The Damned (also plays in A Lesson In Violence). Three new members have entered the realms of Exodus - Lee Altus of Heathen fame, Paul Bastoph best known for his stint in Slayer and previously unheard of vocalist Rob Dukes. \n\nAny metal fan wouldn't be worried about either Paul or Lee as they are of course thrash veterans and excellent at what they do. Then again, there's also a guy who has never been seen earlier in a metal band (or a band) of any kind - Rob Dukes. Is this guy up to the levels of Zetro or not? I'll give this to you straight off the platter - he isn't the easiest vocalist to digest. At first you'd believe he's imitating Zetro but falls short but after many listens you'd realize that this guy's voice is better, more manly and rough therefore perfectly suiting the music style here which I believe Zetro wouldn't have fitted in. The production is absolutely perfect unleashing the monster within the album in terms of brutality. The guitar tone is like Heathen's guitar tone for their latest demo but EVEN heavier. Rob Dukes snarls his way through in the most inhumane way and the riffs are as heavy as a ton of bricks. Solos really do the job just as Tempo did and though Zetro's lyrical sarcasm is missed, the lyrics here are pretty inhumane and brutal as well. I doubt any thrash album can be disappointed with this.\n\nOn a song level, everything rules. Exodus experiments far more than they did with Tempo. Tempo was meant to be a 'safe' album for Exodus in which they just delivered what their fans wanted to get back in the thrash fold even though it was mind-blowing but this album has Exodus experimenting much more than ever. The perfect example would be the 8 minute 30 second thrash epic Deathamphetamine which has some of the heaviest riffs ever recorded. You can see the beauty of the guitar tone in this song right away. Opener Raze is as brutal as it can get and that solo there is pure class and Shudder To Think hits you like a brick wall with its inhumane speed and brutality. Also standing out is the incredible I Am Abomination which slows down the pace a bit and is more groovy - think \"Throwing Down\" off Tempo Of The Damned but 100x heavier and that chorus in Going, Going, Gone! Is tailored perfectly for a live concert. Shovel Headed Kill Machine is a incredible lesson in thrash the Exodus way, never have Exodus been this good since Bonded By Blood and it isn't even the same lineup as Bonded By Blood! Buy or download now!\n\nStandouts: Raze, Deathamphetamine, Shudder to Think, I am Abomination but the entire album is worth hearing.\n",
        "\nI'll say this right at the beginning - what we have here is the best thrash record for many years and an intense comeback for underrated thrash-masters Exodus. Tempo of the Damned was showered with praise since its release and I too am here to praise and not berate it. Never has a thrash album been this sarcastic since The Anti-Christ or as Riff-oriented as Torture Squad's Horror and Torture and though they don\u2019t play fast here - its bludgeoning mid-paced riffs more than make up for it.\n\nExodus were always the underdogs in the thrash movement even though they were superior to many of the thrash bands at the time. Bonded by Blood and Fabulous Disaster were classics in the genre but Exodus were never recognized as much as Megadeth, Metallica, Slayer or Anthrax (known as the big four). Out of these, Metallica has always been the far too overrated one and Anthrax should never be taken seriously (NEVER!). Even though they were appreciated by the scene they never reached the levels of hype or popularity these \"Big Four\" bands did. Yet, despite being pushed down Exodus always come out with an Iron Fist, take for instance THIS very album - after releasing the terrible Impact Is Imminent and the average Force Of Habit, Exodus have reformed with Zetro after a live album and brief stint with former vocalist Paul Baloff who sadly passed away a short time later. The band joined up with Zetro to soldier on the Exodus spirit in Baloff's name and oh my Baloff is damn proud of this album I'm sure!\n\nThis album see's Exodus combine Pure Thrash with some Half-thrash elements and groove. Lets address some of the flaws that people complain about - Exodus always play Mid-paced here and that people feel discouraged by that, but since when were Exodus bad at Mid-paced riffage? Has everyone forgotten Toxic Waltz and other such classics? Many people complain about Zetros voice but I can\u2019t find anything wrong with this! Don\u2019t believe whoever says Zetro sucks here cause they're most likely a bunch of pussies who cant take raw, harsh vocals and probably love Sum41's lead singer's voice. The groove in songs such as Throwing Down and Sealed with a Fist. I never was a fan of groove but both of these songs do well with their groove elements. When music is done well no matter what form it is, it's got to be appreciated. Next, the rapping in Forward March. I am not a guy who says \"Yo Dude, That\u2019s a PHAT tune\" or something like that but I bet no Rap fan would enjoy this, Zetro doesn't overdo it anyway so just quit it.\n\nNow since all the flaws have been checked, let\u2019s check out the good points of the CD. Doing a track by track review would be a waste of time since every song here is above average but I will point out the strong points here. The lyrics are awesome, Zetro combines tongue-in-cheek and rhyme perfectly and manages to come up with some great lyrics that'd make you roll on the floor with laughter. Opener Scar Spangled Banner with its riff heaviness has some of the cheekiest lyrics ever \"I'm no patriot/Just a hate-riot\" and such lines make this even more memorable than the first class play on here has. Next follows THE best song on this album - War Is My Sheppard. The title would raise many a Catholic's hair and the lyrics are just as In-Your-Face and Brutal as the song with Zetro shrieking everywhere almost reminiscent of Dani Filth except a million times better, the chorus is awesome - War! War! War! War Is My Sheppard! Just right for a live concert.\n\nThen appears Blacklist which is another good song - a good chorus and more riff excess makes it a must. Zetro sounds really pissed off in this song and the chorus is just perfect for that kind of vocal attitude. Then Shroud of Urine which is another absolute highlight of the album- not because of its lyrics (which are good as well), not because of Zetro's vocals (which are awesome as well), not because of its chorus (which has hair-raising shrieks from Zetro) but because of that solo there at 2:24. Just listen how it easily compares with many of Judas Priests solos, it slowly builds up and always keeps a great sense of melody within it. Perfect solo if you ask me. Next up is the controversial Forward March which features an issue I have addressed earlier; the song is above-average with some good vocal lines :). Culling The Herd is probably the albums weakest song - its slow and bland, Enjoyable but pretty predictable in the end except for its great solos and a nice chorus. Then Sealed with a Fist is a slow groovy song which people complain quite a lot about, it\u2019s enjoyable, short and the groove isn't overdone. \n\nThe album is in its ending stages and I thought it'd be losing steam at least now but I was once again proved wrong. The very controversial Throwing Down which some lunatics even call \"nu-metal\" just shows that the album isn't dead. Yes, the groove IS overdone but it\u2019s still enjoyable. I'll tell you why - The lyrics = great, the chorus and pre-chorus = rules, the vocals = awesome (esp. during the chorus), that groovy riff = great even though it\u2019s repeated quite a lot, the solo = enjoyable though it has too much wah-wah. Next is the bonded-by-blood session song known as Impaler that's as brutal as the name suggests. Metallica ripped this off Exodus on Trapped under Ice but here Exodus show Metallica how the song is REALLY done! Its awesome, look at that intro-riff just sweet. What Exodus are trying to say is \"We're Number One, We hate Sucktallica\". Overall, a really enjoyable power thrash song. Last up, the title song which is a fitting closer and has all the ingredients for an enjoyable ride. What especially rules in this song is the chorus and the solo. Awesome!\n\nTo conclude this review, I'd like to leave a note on the next album which was just released - This album is not only a great comeback but also a fitting tribute to the late Baloff, Zetro would leave after the release of this and Rob Dukes would come in. I have heard their latest Shovel Headed Killing Machine and I'd say Dukes is trying to imitate Zetro but instead of shrieking he opts for a much hoarser voice than Zetro. I think he is a pretty good replacement for Zetro even though I do miss Zetro's screeching in the new one, anyway what\u2019s done is done and Exodus continues to rule. If you don\u2019t have this album, get it now, if you don\u2019t have the new one, do the same.\n",
        "\nWhat a great album title! It's essentially a new band, Gary Holt the only original member to legitimise trading on the legendary Exodus name. Realising in the world of metal there are no constants, that some bands decline if left to stagnate, espescially as their members get older, Holt has assembled a terriffic lineup to record a worthy follow-up to 'Tempo of the Damned' and stay fresh and vital. If one year is the kind of time Holt and Co. need to record quality modern thrash just like the heyday of the genre in the 1980s I say keep the door revolving.\n\nBut keep Paul Bosteph, he's the real star here. The riffs are thick and meaty like you'd except a piece of shovel headed machinery to be after a few frags. The only criticism comes on the 8 1/2 minute \"Deathamphetamine\" which although enjoying breakneck speed is a little too ambitious with too few ideas to sustain its length. Rob Dukes, the new vocallist, has surely benefited from good production, but nevertheless does a good job, well suited to the modern thrash approach, but at times sounding like a poor man's Tom Angleripper of Sodom in lacking that same venom and punch to rank his performance as truely memorable. \n\nThe rest kills. This album will rank both as one of Exodus' best works and one of the best albums of a year defined by some standouts, but a lot of mediocrity and disspointing releases.\n",
        "\nIn 1985, Exodus shocked the metal world by putting out the aggressive and destructive thrash-fest album known as Bonded by Blood. The album was an all-out thrash attack, with no room to ballads or almost any melodic breaks. Then, Pleasures of the Flesh came out, and got some fans disappointed because it sacrificed some of the brutality of the debut in order to release a \"happier\", more acessible album, in the vein of Anthrax or Testament. In Fabulous Disaster, Exodus did not return to the brutality in BbB, but decided to make a change for the best and, even if this album is still more \"commercial\" than that riff-fest of a debut, it's still a thrash metal assault that will make you headbang as if there was no tommorrow!\n\nFirst of all, you'll notice the great and creative riffs. The title track, \"The Toxic Waltz\", \"Open Season\", \"Verbal Razors\"... there's a lot of strong technical riffage on this album, and even if a little slow and upbeat at times, it's still a shitload more aggressive than many thrash releases that were coming out at the time. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt complement each other perfectly, either when soloing or riffing, making this album worth it just because of the guitarwork. Vocally, Steve \"Zetro\" Souza sounds like the evil version of Bon Scott. His voice is more varied and cleaner than his predecessor Paul Balloff (altough not as bad-ass as that one), with that amazing 70's heavy metal pitch (quite high to show you're a good singer). And mainly, what makes Steve's voice good is the ironic tone he puts in some songs. To be a good thrash singer, you have to either sound evil as fuck (Tom Araya, Mille Pettroza, Schmier) or you have to sing with the correct amount of irony (Dave Mustaine, Joey Belladonna, and of course Steve Souza!). The other high point of the album is the highly technical drumming, that does more than just rythming the songs, becoming a valuable force in some tracks. Altough Tom Hunting would get even better on later works, he already shows a lot of talent in here.\n\nBEST SONGS:\n\nThe Last Act Of Defiance: starting with a spoken introduction, the song soon follows to a brutal riff rythmed by some powerful blastbeats. Steve soon rips the song with it's vocals and it's impossible to resist to shout along with the chorus: THE LAST ACT! OF DEFIANCE!\n\nFabulous Disaster: The best riffs in the entire album are here. It's impossible not to headbang. The lyrics are also great, with some cool and funny rhymes showing up in the verses: \"And forever after, you can hear the laughter, world's getting plastered by an evil bastard, exterminating faster, devastating plaster, fabulous disaster...\" Steve once again shows his amazing vocals here with some fantastic high-pitch screams in the end.\n\nToxic Waltz: A classic in thrash metal... I mean, who doesn't know it? The great starting riff, the fantastic soloing, those hillarious lyrics... great track.\n\nOpen Season: The closer of the album (in some versions of the album the closer is a cover of AC/DC's Overdose) starts with an upbeat riffage that quickly changes into an headbanging monster guitarwork. It's the most \"evil\" song in the album; darker than all the others, with some violent lyrics contrasting to the humour present in the other songs (except of course Like Father Like Son and Last Act of Defiance).\n\nWORST SONGS:\nWell, no horrible tracks here... Cajun Hell is a little weird, mainly because of that silly intro, but it's still good. Corruption is more hardcore than thrash, but it's a good and fast hardcore song. Though the chorus sounds kind of uninspired, the soloing saves it. These could be considered as the worst tracks, and they still kick a lot of ass. \n\nYou know what you get when you listen to Exodus. This album is plain good technical thrash, that mantains aggressivity enough to avoid becoming \"happy\" thrash metal. Melodic and still destructive, that's a fabulous disaster!\n",
        "\nBonded by Blood for it's time was the best thrash metal album around, and still to this day people can relate with it\u2019s speed, constant riffery, and violence. Being a total thrash onslaught that I love Exodus for, this contains some of the best songs metal has to offer. How can every true fucking metal-head not have this peace of raw brutality? Songs that punch your face in like \"And then there were none\", A Lesson in Violence\", or Strike of the Beast are unrelenting riff fests, also some guts/gore filled lyrics about hacking up people, and shanking predators with a switchblade. Paul Baloff\u2019s departure after this album left much sorrow among fans, although they did get together again in 1997 for their Another Lesson in Violence album. Much has already been mentioned about this album, and I figured I should also put my opinion in the pool. Bonded by Blood although perhaps more simple in song composure than what would follow in Exodus's career, are quite well executed by all members. \n\nBBB shows us that Exodus were determined to be the utmost furious thrash band in the SF bay area. Hearing Holt and Hunolt rip through some ultra fast solos and riffery always puts a grin of satisfaction on my face. The drumming is also fucking intense and punishing, Hunting pushing the boundaries of speed. The vocals by Baloff are one of a kind and can never be replaced, although abit on the punkish side, I quite enjoy his vocals. The bass could use a bit of tweaking in the mix job, but sounds great for thrash. Killing is my business...and business is good! Comes to mind when I listen to Bonded, because that was easily Megadeth\u2019s finest and most speed oriented album, released at nearly the same time (listen to the remaster for further proof). A metalheads cherished album, BBB is a bold statement of the brutality they unleash and in their lives. Even some people who don\u2019t like this album say they have respect for it. Those who don\u2019t like this album still hold respect for the weight of influence it had on metal, but they\u2019re ignorant and can\u2019t understand it. I shall no close with some of Baloffs words (R.I.P.) Paul\n\"Lead us into temptation\nA reign of terror will begin deliver us to evil we promise death, world's end!\u201d\n\nBest Tracks: Bonded By Blood, And then there were None, Exodus, A Lesson in Violence, Deliver Us to Evil, Strike of the Beast\n",
        "\nPleasures of the Flesh...a name that when said brings chills up ones spine. Released 2 years after one of the most revolutionary thrash metal albums of all time \"Bonded by Blood\", Pleasure takes off in a fresher direction expanding their already furious speed thrash assault from the bowels of hell itself. The riffs here fucking rule, nuff said. The solos from both Hunolt and Holt are blazing, but not only that they are well executed, meaning they definatly took alot of time in writing the solos because they all sound different and hooky as shit. Hell I would buy this album simply for the guitar solos. Jesus christ and the drumming from Tom fucking Hunting is bloody incredible. Listen to Chemi-Kill or Seeds if Hate for a good reference. The bass is furiously played by Rob McKillop, \"Choose your Weapon\" I noticed recently has some crazy bass. This has to be in my top 5 greatest thrash albums of all time. Without Paul Baloff (metal messiah), another vocal giant makes his debut and he is Steve \"Zetro\" Souza who does an amazing job on here with his maniac like vocals. \n\nI don't understand why people don't give Pleasures of the Flesh more credit, i suppose because every song is different, but this is most definatly quality fucking thrash! The production for 1987 is pretty good, you can hear everything, and i grew to love the production. I suppose the reason i praise this album to no end is because it gives me exactally what I could ever want in a metal album, because every track is quality, and this is some of the best 80's thrash. Also the songs are intelligently arranged and the lyrics really grab out at you. Pleasure's has some of the most evil music ever recorded. Listen to the title track or \"Parasite\". This album should be any thrash fans wet dream. I recall upon first listen, all i heard (the first 30 seconds of Deranged) was some lunatic nutjob raving about his epileptic seizures, eating a nice salad, then suddenly bursting into one of speed metal finest tracks. \n\nIn conclution this is a essential thrasher, and if you don't already own it you must be Braindead.\n\nBest Tracks: Deranged, Til' Death do us part, Parasite, Braindead, Pleasures Of The Flesh, Seeds Of Hate, Chemi-kill\n",
        "\nYes, that's right, Fabulous Disaster is the best of Exodus. I think it tops the renowned Bonded By Blood.\n\nThe album starts out gritty and fast with The Last Act Of Defiance. Even though Exodus played some of the fastest, most raw, and cutting edge thrash of the era, they still managed to incorporate a melodic flow into their music. Fabulous Disaster is a brutal song with a catchy melody and killer riffs. If that wasn't enough Gary and Rick throw in a few glorious solos to add the final touches to a flawless song.\n\nAfter two great opening tracks one might predict that the remainder of the album would be a let down. The Toxic Waltz expunges all doubts. Everyone's heard this song, it even got play on MTV\u2019s old HeadBangers Ball. It's a rough and amusing masterpiece with a catchy melody. You can bet the crowd went crazy when they played this live. \"Kick your friend in the head and have a ball, Come on and do the Toxic Waltz, And slam your partner against the wall!\" Low Rider is another merry song, the old War cover that every ear has heard. It keeps an energetic, almost happy pace amongst the other more barbaric and violent songs. On to track five, Cajun Hell is a good song about some crazy southerners who hunt alligators and live in a swamp. Many bands use raspy vocals and sound like shit, but Souza has perfected the art. He's like a more brutal form of ACDC's Brian Johnson. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt are masters at the guitar, and the longest running members of Exodus, along with the respected drummer Hunting.\n\nLike Father Like Son, what can I say, besides another great thrash song. A little slower than most tracks, but top-notch none the less. Corruption picks up the pace with an angry and crude song about dirty politicians. Exodus wants to know where their tax dollars are going! I can't blame them. Verbal Razors is a gritty piece with magnificent riffs and a gnarly chorus. Open Season is another damn good thrash song. Saturated with murderous riffs and lyrics, it\u2019s one of my favorites. Overdose, a sweet AC/DC cover concludes the elite Fabulous Disaster.\n\nChances are you've heard of Exodus and are familiar with Fabulous Disaster. If not, and you're a fan of heavy metal, thrash, speed, etc. go for it. You really can\u2019t go wrong with this album.\n",
        "\nOkay, I'm happy thrash is making a comeback, and some classic bands are reuniting and producing new material. But, how desperate can you get? Exodus has gone trendy trying to appeal to idiots. \n\nThe Scar Spangled Banner starts out with a good riff, reminds me of old Exodus, but the songs contents are corny. They sound like whiny old men. Damn, what happened? War Is My Sheppard has an okay riff but it lacks that top caliber edge and melody they had on past albums. Blacklist is an average thrash song with an average mid to slow paced riff. Souza sings about assaulting someone for pissing him off and talking shit, and now that person's on his blacklist... \n\nTempo Of The Damned delivers me to track four, Shroud Of Urine. This song sounds like shit, are they trying to be black metal? Please don't screech like that Souza, your voice cracks, and it's obvious you're just screaming like that to attract new black/death fans to your fading band. Sorry, it's the truth. :( Exodus were once legends, but I'm not feeling this album. It's slow for the most part, and it might be time for them to call it quits. There's an alright solo in the middle of the song. Yet, as I stated earlier, for the most part they\u2019re becoming very trendy, anti-christian, anti-patriotic. It's just getting old. Anything to pick up a $ is what I think. Forward March is a fast song with more creative lyrics, the chorus is descent, but it's nothing like Bonded By Blood or Fabulous Disaster. The song is tainted when he yells Forward March like it's some hardcore song a couple times, and it sounds like he's rapping with that riff for a minute yelling mother fucka. Haha. I never thought I'd say this, but Souza\u2019s voice is starting to annoy me. Sounds like a frog a bit. Someone needs to re-animate Baloff. \n\nMoving onto Culling The Herd. Another slower song, with a descent chorus, but it gets boring after a while. Sealed With A Fist is a song about a dude who batters his wife and she eventually gets fed up and shoots him. Interesting combination here, are Exodus satanic feminists? Anyway the songs not too great, but even though it might sound like a lame subject to sing about, I like it somewhat because it tells a story. Anyway, the guy gets what he deserves, and that's how the song ends. \n\nA thing I noticed is Exodus has slowed down considerably, that's not always bad but in Throwing Down it is disastrous. The song sounds like new hardcore. Impaler is a violent song in the vein of old Exodus, just slower once again. Halfway through it speeds up a little and a gnarly solo\u2019s added in for a bonus. It's not quite as melodic as some of the previous songs, not bad though. Reminds me of Kreator a little. Tempo Of The Damned itself is a fast and gritty piece. It once again lacks that great melody Exodus used to incorporate into their songs. Some decent solos here, that\u2019s about it. It's just average thrash, still better than most stuff out there. \n\nAnyway I wouldn't recommend this album. It's Exodus at their worst, but here in the 2000s it's still sounds better than a lot of the newer metal bands. Hey, at least they didn\u2019t go as downhill as Annihilator, ha. Anyway for old guys playing new thrash I'd look into Tankard, Hirax, etc. Exodus is still alright, but their glory days are over.\n",
        "\nThe above equation pretty much summarises this album. This is Bonded by Blood without Metal Command live with some other Baloff era songs thrown in for good fun. And it completely kicks ass. \n\nAll those who enjoy raw production on thrash albums will most likely be dissapointed. As the previous reviewer said, the guitar sound is much more modern. Personally, I find that the Bonded by Blood songs work quite well with this new production, and are even better live, and thus I see no reason to bitch about it. Each band member does his job well, and there are no fuck ups to be found. Also present are Baloff's incredibly cheesy jokes and general awkwardness between songs. Lines such as: \"All right, this one's about fish... It ain't about no goldfish.. And it ain't about no trout... Piranha!\" actually are pretty funny, in a completely retarded way. In any case, its better than Matt Barlow bellowing out \"Brothers and sisters!\" for the 20th time.\n\nOnto the songs. The definite highlight is Bonded by Blood, which is simply meant to be played live with that killer chorus. Piranha also rules quite a lot live, and Impaler and the Pleasures of the Flesh songs rule a lot more with Baloff than with Zetro, proving once again that Baloff was one of the greatest thrash vocalists ever. No Love is also played amazingly with its excellent ass solo. Everything is played well, and there are definitely no weak songs.\n\nSo, what we have here is another excellent live thrash album in the vein of Overkill's Wrecking Everything Live and Sodom's Live in Bangkok. Thrash doesn't get much better than early Exodus, so pick this up and bang your fucking head against the stage!\n",
        "\nA smashing thrash album here, not quite to the strength of their great latest album, but as soon as the first riff bleeds out of the speakers after the spoken intro, the album is clearly set to kill. A few minor setbacks don't hurt it too much, and it's an definite improvement over the last album, though it has a lot of strange similarities. The opening track is almost a carbon copy of \"Deranged\" from the previous disc, and is a well rounded slab of fast, chaotic thrash, and overall the better of the two songs. It's all the album needs to set itself up, so it takes a twist into the catchy, time changing \"Fabulous Disaster\", with that infectious chorus and once more lightning fast. The band are working a lot better together making the playing much tighter and focused, and Zetro is venomous. \n\nMosh anthem \"The Toxic Waltz\" is a heavier beast with a more controlled, moderate pace and adds a sense of fun into the album. The song is definitely designed for the subject of its lyrics, and those headbanging riffs are in supplied in plentiful amounts. One of the highlights here. But what happens now...? A thrash cover of \"Low Rider\"? It annoys the hell out of me really, and doesn't fit in well placed here. It's totally B-side material that was a bit of a misjudgement to put on here. But why the hell are my toes tapping to it... goddamn it! Well maybe it isn't completely horrible, but it really does reek of B-side that should be on an E.P or something.\n\nOne hell of an intro opens itself up into \"Cajun Hell\", yet more thrashy fun that would follow on smoothly from \"The Toxic Waltz\" with some neat guitar work and lots of that Bay Area crunch. They take a maybe unexpected, but certainly not unwelcome epic turn here and what comes out is a very heavy, thundering song piling up the riffs and intricacy with \"Like Father, Like Son\". My pick for the best track on this album. Zetro is very pissed on this song and the guitar work is equally angry and devastating with lead guitar often frantic. Next up is \"Chemi-kill part II\" aka \"Corruption\", more political attacks, more pissed off band members! Which is definitely a plus, since we get another solid crunchy song, especially in that enraged chorus. Reminding of Megadeth's \"Liar\", \"Verbal Razors\" melds some decidedly more witty lyrical content which also shows a sense of humour with a song that is a little plainer to start with, but unfolds neatly by the end.\n\n\"Open Season\" is back to the successful formula that began the album complemented by a great thrash break that comes straight at you out of nowhere. On the CD version, there's an AC/DC cover that concludes things. However, not being much of a fan of the band, I tend not to listen to it, but if you like them this might be worth a listen.\n\nDespite some small inconsistencies, the band is on fine form belting out some great thrash tunes with conviction. Not the best album in this style, but it's one to come back and listen to over and over again. It has plenty of lasting appeal.\n",
        "\nAfter the excellent Fabulous Disaster actually established a mark so high in the subgenre that it does not even deserve the derisive label \"whiffle thrash\", Exodus comes back with this album, which doesn't merely need a sticker slapped on it, but should basically be put in the Canonical Example display case, along with that horrendous third Testament LP, and most of the career of Sacred Reich. Kids, THIS IS WHIFFLE BALL THRASH. Listen once, so you know. While you're at it listen once to Opeth. Both are about as useful to the world at large, though this, admittedly, is slightly more enjoyable than 12 minute acoustic ballads. But not by much, especially after 2 or more listens.\n\nYep, this album completely sucks. Other than one almost accidental-sounding destroyer of worlds (\"Only Death Decides\"), this is filled with angsty political crap that would make the later Clash call shenanigans. Stuff like \"Changing of the Guard\" and \"A.W.O.L.\" is completely redemption-free pandering to the state of the free world. The Berlin Wall hears you. The Berlin Wall doesn't care.\n\nHowever, the opener is also pretty fucking good... it's like so many bands: they take all the good ideas, and throw them into one song, and we've got a winner, that could basically be on the previous album. Forceful vocals, triumphant riffs, and fast-as-fuck as good thrash is meant to be.\n\nThen, all sorts of feces hits the fans. The choruses become more mocking, Zetro's vocals becomes more and more silly... the whole thing flops onto its rear end dies. I actually can't get through the whole thing. The riffage is weak, and the songs sound like Regurgitated Cow Fetus, in that \"let's pick a riff, write some lyrics in 2 minutes, and whip it out\". I must say, though, the production is a slight bit better.\n\nThe rest? Wow, what a bunch of non-winnars. \"Heads They Win (Tails You Lose)\" starts off damn promising, with the riff buildup not at all overlong, but then the pre-chorus and chorus are complete shit, and after about 2 minutes, there's really nothing left to hear... and 5 more minutes left in the song. \"Thrash Under Pressure\" - take your own advice. The song is an attempt at Toxic Waltz II, but this comes out nowhere as intentionally humorous, especially when the lyrics, as defiant as they may appear, making no sense in the context of what they are describing. \"With my head held high, standing dignified, I still have my integrity...\"\n\nI think not.\n",
        "\nExodus paradoxically improved themselves on this album, by moving further in the direction away from Bonded by Blood, as they had done on Pleasures of the Flesh. However, this one succeeds where that one had failed, as that one was neither as above, nor so below. It was not the evil hard-hitting \"all poseurs must be trowelled in the cunt... if they did not bring their own cunt, one will be provided for them\" deathfuck of Bonded by Baloff. Nor was it this album, which goes all-out leftist-political a la so many other 1989 thrash bands, and puts in a generic late 80s production, a la so many other 1989 thrash bands, and generally is not particularly brutal.\n\nBut, it is enjoyable... because half the songs here were not written in 1986 for Baloff to do, and then hastily rezetrolated for mass distributed. This album shows Exodus more comfortable with their new direction, and out come a bunch of competently assembled packages of verbal razors.\n\nSpeaking of... that's one of the highlights of the album. Imagine Megadeth's \"Liar\", except with Zetro providing the insults, not Mustaine. Now Mustaine is genuinely angry, and out of that comes a blockheaded rage meant to actually cut down - while Zetro, that happy-go-lucky little bastard, knows that an insult is best when it gets a good laugh. So here, straight from the \"make yourself at home, Frank - hit somebody!\" school of thought comes Verbal Razors... a strung-out fucking junkie with a college degree!! Add the speeding destructive riffs, showing that no matter how much their production will get toned down, the Slayteam of Holt and Hunolt will never get mistaken for the plodding stupidity of James Hetfield or Eric Peterson, or whatever the fuck the dudes in Forbidden and Sacred Reich are called. There is only one H-team, and it is on proud display here.\n\nThrow in a slightly, slightly odd guitar tone that manifests itself every once in a while in the riffage - like intro to the title track (THE absolute best shit on here), which also combines a frightfully great vocal delivery with insane bullet-to-the-head riffage. That's when the album is greatest, when it rings like a nail, to the head. The vocals and riffs follow the same absurdly fast melody line, and the resonance is far more than the sum of its parts. Add in a slightly different riff at every line of the verse - holy crap, this song is impressive.\n\nAt times we move into more epic territory... for example, \"Like Father, Like Son\", which goes through more riffages than any three other songs in its over eight minutes - entirely enjoyable, especially when the middle break comes a-thrashing at 5:01... and even the opener, The Last Act of Defiance - there is a certain atmosphere here that is missing on so many whiffle-thrash albums of the world. \n\nThe album does, however, kinda fade at the end... with the sorta recycled-sounding Open Season... by that point it doesn't really add anything to the band's career, sounding half Verbal Razors, and half Faster Than You'll Ever Live to Be. Also, Corruption is pretty good in the verses, but suffers from a Big Dumb Chorus. \n\nThen of course we have the usual noise that plugs up later Exodus albums... the silly intro to open the track, and the obligatory No-Love-30-Seconds interlude, which manifests itself as the intro to Cajun Hell... then the War cover, Low Rider, which is nowhere near thrash, but is completely enjoyable in the same way that Brain Dead was from the previous album. There aren't any really completely losar moments on the album, and it passes under both casual and intense listening - the riffs are creative enough, especially in the beginning few songs, to distract the technically minded, and there is enough variety and catchiness to make it worthy of being played 7 times in a row in the car.\n\nOh yeah and there's the Toxic Waltz. It's basically this band's \"Breaking the Law\". So completely inane that you can't help but love it.\n\nGET UP OFF YOUR FEET, DON'T LOOK SO OBSOLETE, AND THRASH LIKE AN ATH-UH-LETE.\n",
        "\nBy 1987, thrash as a genre was basically out of the creative stage, well into the refinement stage, and entering the recession stage. The second Exodus album may have helped hinge the genre towards one of its most onerous developments: whiffle thrash.\n\nWhiffle thrash, as practiced by bands like Sacred Reich and a thousand others, combines leftist-political and personal-violence lyrics with slightly weakened riffage, and a generally more poppy and upbeat production. While at times the work is still extremely enjoyable (Anthrax's \"State of Euphoria\"), there is also a huge potential for self-parody (Sacred Reich, \"The American Way\", Testament \"Practice What You Preach\"), and these efforts are not nearly as rotten-to-the-core as the thrash genre's evil progenitors: Slayer, Dark Angel, Kreator, etc etc... \n\nAnd of course, add to that list, the first Exodus album. For 1985, a hallmark of brutality, that would've set the world afire in 1986, and completely ripped face had it been released on time in 1984. But by 1987, Exodus seemed to turn in a somewhat different direction. A 1986 demo with Baloff on vocals seemed to hint at Bonded by Blood Part II, but somewhere between that, and the release of this LP, things went in a more commercial direction.\n\nNot overtly, incredibly so, of course. This is no Master of Puppets, and not even an Impact is Imminent or a The New Order. This does not drip with poseurrific lechery. It's just got sort of a soft production and a generally happy vocal delivery, combined with riffs that just don't hit hard with sawblades, like on the previous album. So I cannot pronounce this album BAD, I just cannot enjoy it in the context of its predecessor, and even the demo for it.\n\nI keep mentioning this three-song demo: Seeds of Hate, Pleasures of the Flesh, and Brain Dead, all appeared on this LP. Brain Dead is the catchiest, most power-metallish number of the three, and would not have made quite as much sense on Bonded by Blood as the other two... even with Baloff's bizarro delivery, it is still melodic in a completely different way than, say, \"And Then There Were None\". There are sing-along choruses, and then there are sing-along choruses.\n\nThe other two, and also the non-demo tracks \"Faster Than You'll Live to Be\" and \"Deranged\", are Bonded-by-Blood thrashers, just with the aforementioned slightly cute production. This isn't the first-two-Razor speed metal holocaust, or even the slightly overcompressed sound of the third Overkill... this is basically Bonded by Blood, just without the edge. I cannot see Zetro going off at the crowd, demanding the blood of poseurs. Baloff was just a fucking maniac, and that showed in the entire band's performance. Here, we've got silly intros (title track, Deranged), random interludes (30 seconds), and the production, complete with that very recognisable not-quite-thrash lead guitar tone (you know it when you hear it!), as I mentioned, is just a slight bit poppish in that mid-80s-Judas-Priest style. Ram it Down, while sonically not close, is stylistically an equivalent.\n\nThe rest of the album? Try the political stuff of Chemi-Kill, and the generic aggression of Parasite - concepts that would come up later on such things as basically the whole Impact is Imminent album. They are pretty good songs... but you can see Zetro getting just a bit funny here: \"tumors are growing in my spleen, the children are turning green\". This isn't the persecution mania he would deliver on \"I'm no patriot, just a hateriot\", which is so over-the-top that it is believable again. This manages to be neither here nor there. See also his delivery in the opening line of \"Til 'Death Do Us Part\", which sounds like he's either just warming up, or trying his best Donny Osmond impression.\n\nBut, I rag on this album far too much. Exodus's first few are really quite good - it's only around Impact is Imminent where they fell off the map, and Force of Habit wasn't all that bad, and of course the new one is a crash-course in brain-fuck. There is some really great shit here... the title track alternates nicely between some rage riffs and that melodic riff... Chemi-Kill is not as cheesy as I had made it out to be, with the lyrics coming together quite nicely in that way only Zetro can do. Deranged, aside from the stupid intro (which is disconcerting in that it is twice as loud in the right channel as in the left), is quite awesome, as is Faster Than You'll Ever Live to Be, which Testament kindly borrowed and turned into \"The Preacher\".\n\nYep, listen to this, and you can hear good ideas being aped into bad ideas. But do listen, as it is a pretty good album. I find myself listening to it quite a bit, though again, expect no Bonded by Blood.\n",
        "\nThis limited edition EP is simply a teaser for all Exodus fanatics worldwide that anxiously awaited the full length release of Tempo Of The Damned.\nSince their are only four songs on this EP, this review will be short and straight to the point.\nFirst off, War is my Shepherd, I don't know where Zetro found this newly revamped and rejuvenated vocal approach, but I fuckin' love it! Zet has never sounded so menacing in all of his years in Exodus. His vocal approach and delivery on the chorus would make a rhino turn and run. Angst driven testosterone is the overall vibe of the vocal delivery. Musically this band has never done ANYTHING that is simplistic and the H-Team once again shreds the shit out of their guitars, leaving the listener to imagine the smoke that must have been rising from the fretboards at the end of the solos. Hunting's drumming is exceptional as always and with Andy Sneap now handling the production duties this band is about as tight sounding as their going to get.\nNext we have Sealed With A Fist. This was actually originally titled \"Angary\", but for whatever reason the song was released as such. A typical sounding Exodus song that crunches along with those EMG pickups. Not too far derived from something that may have been featured on the Fabulous Disaster album.\nTrack #3 is Impaler, now I'm a little bit biased about this song simply because Kirk Hammet had something to do with it, and him having anything to do with this band, simply doesn't seem right. This is a group of guys that are truly all about the music, and their talent as musicians superceeds far beyond anything that Metallica could ever achieve in terms of musicianship.\nJust the same though, its a decent track but not one of Exodus' best by any means.\nLastly, we have Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, since one of Exodus favorite bands is ACDC, it would only seem logical that they eventually did an official cover version of one of their songs. The sound is amazing on this tune and they definately do the song justice. On a historical note, Exodus actually already recorded this song live back in 91 for the Good Friendly Violent Fun album.\nOverall a Great EP that is worth aquiring as a collectors item.\n",
        "\nFabulous Disaster is pretty damn wobbly if you ask me, something several of my fellow reviewers commented on quite ably. The band doesn't seem to be taking an album this crucial as seriously as they should be, recording a pair of covers and even ending the album with one. \"Overdose\" is a pretty good AC/DC cover, sorta hammering home the fact that Zetro sounds a bit like Bon Scott even if the man doesn't have a tenth of the commitment and attitude ol' Bonny had in his pinky finger. Alas. The other cover, \"Low Rider\" is a hokey piece of crap, really chopping into the considerable slam-bang momentum the band had been building up, breaking up a streak that would've stretched from \"Last Act of Defiance\" through to \"Like Father, Like Son\". It's well played, but you'll never really want to hear it again after the first time.\n\nThe band goes way over the top with \"Verbal Razors\" and \"Corruption\" with the big gang vocal style chorus (see virtually any band on Metal Blade at the time) that generally annoys me to no end. It doesn't sound big, it sounds really fucking cheesy. That's all. It taints not a few of my favourite thrash records. To be fair, the lyrics on both of these songs never fail to bring a smile to my face and the guitar sound on \"Corruption\" is gold.\n\nStill, nothing beats the slam-bang instant connectivity of \"The Toxic Waltz\". The song plays like a less serious \"Whiplash\" (or to be less creative, \"Brain Dead\"), right down to name-dropping the name of the band, the inherent silliness of the lyrics just plain working because of the perfect riff. It's a metal dancing song that works, and I'd be hardpressed to find a dyed in the wool metal head of a certain age who didn't get all wistful about all the dead braincells sacrificed to the manic kick of this track. I think the slow-down is unnecessary (the moshing was going quite fine without the obligatory 'mosh break', thanks), but hey what are you gonna do? Obviously Exodus knew they had something on their hands as they drop a little reprise in at the end of \"Open Season\".\n\nObviously the big, long epic is gonna merit examination over and above that afforded to the rest of this infectiously catchy rogues gallery (have I mentioned that no other thrash band released a record even near this catchy?) and it's attention well deserved. The damned thing actually manages to tackle a real subject and tackle it well, looking beyond the traditional 'daddy beat me up!' songs (KoRn, I'm looking at you) to the source of the problems, the way violence is passed down generation to generation. Zetro is maybe a little melodramatic in places, but the constant riff changes and oddly doomy scope of the thing really holds up, more so because it doesn't have very many melodic sections like most big NWOBHMish epics (\"Heathen's Song\", \"Armed and Dangerous\", \"Fade to Black\"). The vaguely eastern lead licks are particularly grandiose.\n\nI could do a song by song, but it's not necessary. This album features good songs (\"Fabulous Disaster\", \"Cajun Hell\", etc.) and songs unlikely to be recalled by the band when picking out the sets, or by fans requesting them. The album certainly is unique, and at only $4.99 Canadian, it was more than worth the cost. Pick it up if you're a fan of Bay Area Thrash on the lighter side, but if you don't like humour in your metal, you might want to avoid it.\n\nStand-Outs: \"The Toxic Waltz\", \"Like Father Like Son\", \"Fabulous Disaster\"\n\nEDIT: I'd like to apologize for the original opening paragraph of this review which went as follows:\n\n\"To start off this review, I'd like to talk not about the album but rather about the review of the album tucked in after the lyrics to \"Open Season\" on the '99 re-issue that I have. Why exactly the label thought that anyone would care about a review for an album they'd already bought from a no-name reviewer working for a bushleague and probably long out-of-business metal mag is beyond me, but nevertheless I'll play along. The reviewer, one B0rivoj Krgin of Metal Forces magazine (seriously, that's how it's spelled in the booklet) gives the album a healthy 90 and to the label's credit does include some reasonably accurate criticism, some of which I share. However, he seems hell-bent on including the word 'crunch' in just about every other line of the review, and his hopeful prediction that Exodus would only go up and up from here on is almost laughable. Dunno why I decided to share that, but anyhow there's an album to reviewed here.\"\n\nSince the initial publication of this review I have become more aware of the historical significance of Mr. Krgin and the Metal Forces 'zine and a little more respect was in order. Krgin's review is rather bland and it is a pretty cheap and needless extra but that's beside the point. Well, it isn't really. But, like, I should've been nicer about it or something. - OSS\n",
        "\nThanks to Chris Tsangarides who did the production on Painkiller (need I mention the band?) Exodus have released one of the deadliest sounding albums I've ever heard...listen to those EMG's crunch! When I say deadly, I mean deadly...this disc killed my stereo system in my car back when I was in high school. Lesson to be learned...Exodus are a force to be reckoned with mother fuckers! This was their last album to be released on Capitol records before being dropped by the label and pretty much vanishing for the next 5 years. \nFor some reason, unknown to me...this album gets very little recognition as being a great album. Everyone always seems to say, \"Exodus...oh yeah, bonded by blood, or Fabulous Disaster\". Are those albums great, YES, but by point of fact, everything that this band does is great...As far as I'm concerned this is the most mature sounding Exodus album of all time, the musicianship is top notch...especially from Gary and Rick who are undoubtebly the best guitar duo in the history of Thrash Metal. This album also marks the first time that Zetro ever did any clean style vocals (see Good Day To Die), and he executes them perfectly with melody and creative feel that is both rich and textured.\nNo point in breaking down every song, since every song is worthy to be heard. Aquire this album wherever you can find it...your metal collection is simply not complete without it.\n",
        "\nFor some reason, many people don't recognize this album as being a great Exodus release. I personally don't feel that this is true, nor do I feel that Exodus have EVER released anything that I consider to be weak. This album starts off with one of the most killer thrash riffs of all time, and that would be the intro to Impact is Imminent. A great song with killer lyrics and awesome background vox, not unlike their previous album \"Fabulous Disaster\" which was also chalk full of riot sounding Vox. Next is AWOL, which is another intelligently written song, again with awesome vocals and an intense array of thrashy riffs. The Lunatic Parade is a typical sounding Exodus song with alot of \"riot\" style vocals that aren't that different from say The Toxic Waltz, a real catchy, groovy thrasher. Within the Walls of Chaos...is a very political song, much like AWOL, however its not as brutal in the sense that the ferocity is not as as prevalent, but it still chugs along with some decent riffs and as always great lead guitar work from the H-Team. Objection Overruled is the video that pretty much glorified Exodus on MuchMusic and MTV's Headbanger's ball for a short while, unfortunately however, although it was a good song, it was probably one of the weaker tracks on the album and didn't really depict the overall feel of the album. Next we have Only Death Decides...this is the best track on the album, and marks the first song ever written by Gary Holt in drop D tuning. A killer song with great lyrics and an awesome riff thats as powerful as it is heavy...this should've been the song that was made into a video. Heads they Win(tails you lose) and Changing of the Guard are kinda like filler tracks, but they are still listenable and would not be considered \"skip worthy\" by any true metalheads standards. Lastly we have Thrash under pressure...and oh my god does this song live up to its title. An extremely hilarious tongue in cheek lyrical song that is loaded with intense thrash riffs and neck breacking rythmic patterns, a great song to end this classic, underrated album with\n",
        "\nMan! This band have been getting a lot of play from me recently, standard Bay Area crunchy Thrash Metal, which certainly does the trick for me! Plentiful on the energy, solid in the songwriting and exploding with untamed attitude. But when it comes down to it, there are stil a few hurdles the band have to get over, they're a little sloppy at times which leaves the whole thing falling behind, taking away potentially memorable Thrash songs, you can look on the tracklisting on the back and think \"How on earth does that song go again?\" while looking down and remembering that really amazing riff from the title track. Give it a few years and maybe I'll know every note but for now the high points stand out clearly after each listen and leave the rest behind. I also play the follow up \"Fabulous Disaster\" a lot more and this album gets generally left on the shelf. Sometimes they also get some really neat ideas and don't follow them through for a whole song, you get the old ups and downs thing which is irritating. The album is generally more consistent than the follow up in the general style its going for (there's no questionable and out of the way filler, minus the falsely advertised \"30 seconds\", more like 40 seconds lol), but those problems really do it in on occassion. Now away with the downside to this potentially classic Thrash platter, and onto the good stuff!\n\nAs I said, this album is definitely on the right lines generally, Steve Souza's shredding and shrill voice has got the right attitude for the music, and the whole band seems to be having a fun time, with a playful side throwing in some humour to mix with the serious political attacks and general Thrash concerns. Nothing on here is over the top or trying too hard to do more than simply get solid results. The highlights include \"Brain Dead\" carried along by its catchy main riff, the title track, on the right aggressive track with plenty of substance, \"Seeds of Hate\" with those unstoppable leads and \"Chemi-Kill\". The rest wanders from the very good to being undermined by the general problems I highlighted, also suffering from a slightly weak production. This album should nonetheless go into an Exodus collection, the energy is infectious! It does work together with \"Fabulous Disaster\" as a worthy 2 album \"set\" but is the weakest part.\n",
        "\n\"Tempo of the Damned\" is an album, that by most means, should not exist. The reunion with Paul Baloff was inspiring some small hope in my system the Exodus could release a long shot followup to the amazing \"Bonded by Blood\" but this was not to be. Baloff dies, (R.I.P. king of thug-thrash), the band rehires the whiney Steve \"Zetro\" Souza and now we have this new platter of middling thrash metal.\n\nFirst off, I will start with the compliments...the band are tight. Probably tighter than ever before. The stop on a dime guitar lurches and drumming really prove who the Bay Area's best musical thrashers were from the early 80's...the production too is top notch. Had this had better songwriting, the sound would have brought an amazing lift to the overall product and we would have had Bonded in Blood part 2.\n\nSadly...amazing musicianship and tight production cannot fix a lack of amazing songs and outdated attempts at lyrical rage. The CD falls off the tracks when the band starts to shamble through songs that all bear quality riffs but no real discerning hooks or interesting movements. From afar, the songwriting is beefy thrash with muscular riffcraft, but upon closer examination it's simply junk food that snows the listening over with chugging intensity over chugging creativity. The lyrics sound like angry punk rock, without the convincing rage to back up the message. This form of CNN metal only worked when handled with education and wit, not random opinion polls taken in ones back yard. This is hardly an artistic triumph, more a triumph of good production and slamming, energetic riffwork to please you in the moment.\n\nI suggest this CD for all thrash addicts, Exodus fans and the like, but don't be expecting an truly inspired work from the old legends, just be expecting another moshfest that you'll not even be spinning this time next year.\n\nIt could have been worse...but it could have been MUCH better.\n\nLet's hope this is the last...\n",
        "\nEXODUS want you to bang your head like its 1988. Few metal comeback albums have been as greatly anticipated as this one, and the buzz leading up to and immediately following the release of \"Tempo Of The Damned\" has been considerable. I\u2019ll admit, I had some serious doubts that the band would be able to produce an album up to the standard of some of their classic earlier works. \"Bonded By Blood\" and \"Fabulous Disaster\" were giant names in the metal world in the mid and late 80\u2019s, with the former continuing to be regarded as one of the best thrash albums ever produced. \n\nDoes the new one live up to the buzz and expectation? Surprisingly, yes. EXODUS has produced a strong new album that sounds like, well, a lot of their other albums. EXODUS have not reinvented themselves, gone nu metal, added sampling, or changed their songwriting, style or sound. What they have done is produce an album packed full of the formula that made them such a success in the 80\u2019s. The fat, chunky guitar riffs and alternating single and double bass drum gives \"Tempo Of The Damned\" a wonderfully retro sounding Bay Area thrash sound. With only a few exceptions such as SHADOWS FALL, that sound has been lacking recently. Andy Sneap\u2019s production gives the album a crisp and polished sound that maximizes the band\u2019s strengths. \n\nThe band hits a home run right out of the gate with the opening track, \"Scar Spangled Banner\", a scathing indictment of America\u2019s culture of violence, war and indifference. It is a perfect opener and gets the head banging quite nicely, thank you. Other stand out tracks include \"War Is My Shepherd\", \"Forward March\", the title track, and most interestingly, a version of the Kirk Hammett era track, \"Impaler\". The latter, a live favorite, fits in nicely with the other material, and serves as further evidence of the band\u2019s consistency. \n\nThe band\u2019s strengths remain the same, and unfortunately, so do their weaknesses. The lyrics are often cheesy or just plain silly (see the ridiculously titled \"Shroud Of Urine\"). There are a lot of fans that are still loyal to the original singer, Paul Baloff, who had reunited the band and would have been on this album if not for his recent death. There is a feeling that Baloff was a superior singer over Steve Souza, the man that has been with EXODUS for most of their existence. Let\u2019s be honest, neither one is an especially good singer. Souza\u2019s sound is a nasally high pitch growl reminiscent of a mix between the two AC/DC singers, Bon Scott and Brian Johnson. It appears this is a debt that the band accepts as they have covered AC/DC\u2019s \"Overdose\" and \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" on their albums. Souza sometimes uses a lower pitched yell and on the track \"War Is My Shepherd\", his yell of \u201cWar!\u201d is reminiscent of another old school metal singer (Araya\u2019s \"War Ensemble\" anyone?). \n\nIt is a little early to tell whether EXODUS will win over a new metal audience with this effort, but for those of you who loved \"The Toxic Waltz\" the first time around, \"Tempo Of The Damned will be right up your alley. Old school, 1988 all over again. The mullet may even make a comeback.\n",
        "\nThere has been a truckload of hype and controversy about this album. Some people call it the return of Exodus, while others dismiss it as another veteran band trying (and failing) to make a comeback.\n\nTempo of the Damned is the perfect example of what I call a \"valley\" album, where the best songs are at the beginning and end, while the middle of the album is filler and/or total suckage. Unfortunately, Exodus decided to make 5 fast paced songs (Scar Spangled Banner, War is My Shepard, Shroud of Urine, Impaler, and Tempo of the Damned), and 5 mid/slow paced songs.\n\nAs for the fast songs, Scar Spangled Banner opens up with, (again) unfortunately, the best riff on the album. It really reminds you of old Exodus, with the aggression and hatred and all that hoopla. War is My Shepard continues the strong opening, with Zetro screaming like he's never done before. Skip past Blacklist (we'll get to that later), and you come to Shroud of Urine, which is another good, solid thrash song. Shroud of Urine also has some of the coolest (and goofiest) lyrics on the album, with such phrases as \"crucifucked\" being thrown around. Skip through the next handful of tracks (which, again, we'll tackle in a moment), and you come to Impaler. Now, Impaler was one of the most hyped parts of this album, since it was cowritten by Hammet back in the day (waaaaaayyyyyy back in the day). The song is strong, and you can tell it is old, since it doesn't really fit with the rest of the album. The album ends with the title track, which is another solid thrasher.\n\nThese five songs, if left alone, would have made a great album. Album of the year? No way. Top five? Definitely. Alas, we still have those other songs to look at, which is why this album only gets a 50%.\n\nStarting with \"Blacklist\", the album takes a turn for the worse. I swear, they must have gotten AC/DC to write this song for them, as it sounds like it came straight off of an AC/DC album. This would be all fine and dandy if it wasn't on a fucking EXODUS ALBUM. The other four filler/suckage tracks seem to just waste space and go right over my head. I found myself thinking \"why the fuck did they add this to the album?\" over and over again.\n\nOne really, really good thing about the album, despite the inconsistency, is Zetro's voice. He really puts on a performance, matching the intensity of Baloff, while keeping his own intentity. Why the hell didn't he sing like this all along? Now I want him to go rerecord the vocals for Pleasures of the Flesh, which would make it 10x better. Anyways, think Baloff meets Chuck Billy and you pretty much got Zetro.\n\nSo all in all, did this album impress me? Yes. Did this album disappoint me? Definitely. This would probably be a good album to get someone into \"extreme\" metal, but those diehard fans who were expecting another Bonded By Blood will be left scratching their head. If you really want to hear the best of it, download the previously mentioned five fast-paced songs. Forget the rest.\n",
        "\n\u2026The riffs fall like rain! Oh yes, ladies and gentlemen, Exodus are back to smash your brains in like you\u2019ve never had your brains smashed in before. With their latest release Tempo of the Damned, legendary Bay Area thrashers brings back the riff assault of the H-Team in a majestic manner, and they\u2019re still kicking ass as though it was 1985 all over again. However, several modernized elements are very evident in the songwriting on here; the first one you\u2019ll notice being the pretty clean and to a certain extent rather slick, but heavy-as-shit production, which personally I love. The weird-sounding high notes on the guitar tone take some time getting used to, especially those first opening notes of the album. But when you\u2019ve played it a few times, man, it kicks your face in so hard that you can feel the excruciating pain all through your skull, forcing you to bang your head like a madman as soon as Tom Hunting starts pounding the shit out of his drum kit.\n\nThe songwriting also shows some modernized elements at times; even the mad thrashers like \u201cWar Is My Shepherd\u201d sound very modern in arrangements and riff-style, but still kill as much as many old-school thrash monsters like Death Angel\u2019s \u201cKill As One\u201d or Kreator\u2019s \u201cRipping Corpse\u201d. And to be compared with such awesome songs, it certainly has to own- and oh man, it does.\nBut most of the songs on here are mostly groove-based, but unlike what some might say, these groovy songs sounds far more like \u201cThunderhead\u201d (Overkill) than \u201cWalk\u201d, and still manage to thrash pretty well. Just listen to \u201cBlacklist\u201d and you\u2019ll know what I mean \u2013 a midpaced and quite \u2018controlled\u2019 song, but one of the most menacing tunes they\u2019ve done.\n\u201cYou\u2019d better start runnin\u2019 cause you know that I\u2019m comin\u2019!\u201d Fuck yes.\n\nBut before I praise it too much, I need to point out the one weak point of the album: \u201cThrowing Down\u201d. Urgh. \u201cThunderhead\u201d, this is not. Annoying aggressions in the lyrics that sound anything but honest, and whiney half-thrash vocal melodies that suck like there\u2019s no tomorrow. And the riffs are pretty fucking boring too.\nYeah, this song blows, but it can easily be forgiven, cause the other stuff is so damn good.\n\nThe best songs are definitely the fast-paced bangers (Though \u201cBlacklist\u201d is definitely up there! As is \u201cCulling The Herd\u201d \u2013 wicked riffage, and you just gotta love the wonderfully brutal lyrics). The one that stands out as my definite favourite is the opening track \u201cScar Spangled Banner\u201d. Beginning with perhaps the most memorable riffs on the whole album, which is to reappear several times during the song providing some headbanging madness, this is an all-out thrasher lashing out fiercely at U.S.A. with clever and well-done anti-war lyrics which is all too rare these days.\nAnother personal favourite of mine is \u201cForward March\u201d. The fast-paced riffs are crushingly heavy and catchy, the extended solo section is goddamn groovy, and the rapping part (yes, he does rap) is actually pretty catchy and not at all horrible, simply because they just infused it at one point in one song instead of spawning an entire genre on talking over sampled songs you didn\u2019t even write. BUT, the best part on here is the verse. Man, that is so fucking in your face that there are no words, and by now I think we all know how much I love that shit.\n\u201cSo never underestimate the mind of evil thoughts. I will bring you down, spit you out before I\u2019m caught. Because I have the power, and the upper hand \u2013 Everybody in the way will know that I\u2019m the man!\u201d\nBow to the gods of thrash, Exodus have taken over the throne yet again, for the first time since Bonded By Blood. And there\u2019s more!\n\u201cShroud of Urine\u201d is a midtempo crunching tune with clever anti-religion lyrics (\u201cYou\u2019re cruci-fucked and you\u2019re out of luck, if you put your faith in the flock!\u201d Gotta love that line) and a very interesting almost power metal-sounding lead section, which brings your thoughts to their own \u201cParasite\u201d or perhaps \u201cBlack Line\u201d by Overkill.\n\nAnd not to forget the fucking title track. BOW TO THE TEMPO OF THE DAMNED! Crazy thrash all the way through, that\u2019s all there is to say. Like riffs? Of course you do. So you like this song, and album. Fact, not opinion.\n\nAnd all the other stuff, it rules too (aside from \u201cThrowing Down\u201d, obviously). This is not an all-out assault of fast and brutal thrash, so don\u2019t expect a Pleasure To Kill. This still sounds modern, and has lots of midpaced groove elements. If you like later Overkill (think Bloodletting), then this should definitely appeal to you. But the fans of the crushing fast-paced onslaught of \u201cBonded By Blood\u201d will get theirs too. All in all, this is a mandatory thrash release and the best album I\u2019ve heard in the genre in quite some time. Go get it, assholes, if you don\u2019t already, cause this plain owns. Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt slay like crazy on both riffs and solos, and \"Zetro\" sounds more brutal, vicious and aggressive than ever with that strange combination of Bon Scott combined with shouting or half-growling vocals, Tom Hunting delivers his possibly greatest drum performance on here, and the bass for once on an Exodus album is audible in the mix, and it is very well played, providing a solid backbone together with the drumming.\nOh yeah, and the mention of Bon Scott reminded me- they did yet another AC/DC cover on here (well, on the digipak version), and man, this is so many times better than Overdose! Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap is turned into a monstrously heavy, dirty crusher while maintaining the classic AC/DC attitude and swing, and comes out fucking killer. Excellent job.\n\n\nOverall... you need this. Now excuse me, but I must headbang.\nWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR! WAR IS MY SHEPHERD!\n",
        "\n\"Fabulous Disaster\" seems to be greatly loved among Exodus fans, and hailed by many as the definite album by this band. And while it certainly is an awesome thrasher, \"Bonded By Blood\" is definitely above it. But nonetheless, this has its fair share of relentless riffing combined with insanely catchy songwriting, just like any classic Exodus release.\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much what the main focus here is. Riff after riff, most of them very memorable and containing some good abilities to repeatedly bash your brains on. On top of this Zetro does some damn memorable and catchy vocal lines (especially on the title track, one of the catchiest thrashers I\u2019ve heard and definitely the best song on the album). Combine that with very solid, varied and often snare-heavy drumming courtesy of Tom Hunting. The basswork however is pretty inaudible from time to time, and doesn\u2019t do much for the record. \nBut what I want when I listen to Exodus is mainly the guitarwork of the H-team, and I get just want I want.\n\nWe start up with 2 fast-paced thrashers, \"The Last Act of Defiance\" and \"Fabulous Disaster\", two definite highlights on there. Especially the latter, which has that one insanely cool, foreboding and catchy-as-hell opening riff kicking into the monster main riff... man, that is some catchy shit. Steve Zetro Souza meanwhile delivers some rapid-fire vocal lines that just keep on coming. \u201dAnd forever after, you can hear the laughter, world\u2019s being plastered, by an evil bastard, exterminating faster, devastating plaster, fabulous disaster! Now you can see what this all means to me, when the bomb! Comes falling! DOWN!\u201d Aaaaagh, headbanging madness!\n\nAnd more madness is to follow \u2013 Everybody\u2019s doin\u2019 THE TOXIC WALTZ! The pace slows down somewhat compared to the first two. \"The Toxic Waltz\" rages away at a still very efficient pace with some absolutely crushing riffs, that were very obviously designed for moshing madness. \u201cEverybody\u2019s doin\u2019 the toxic waltz, kick your friend in the head and have a ball!\u201d Hell yes, this rules.\n\nBut after this, the album drops in quality for a short moment. First up is the War cover, \"Low Rider\", which is completely thrashed up compared to the original but still feels really weak and harmless compared to the crushing first three songs. Still, some nice groove and catchy vocals are to be found on here, and it\u2019s not at all a bad song, just doesn\u2019t quite work with the overall vibe of the album so far.\nBut things stay less serious anyway, with \"Cajun Hell\" being next up. The lyrics are silly and fun, but the riffage also makes a welcome return here, although it begins with a fun country-ish intro. Though this song stands out as one of the weaker songs on here, mostly cause the vocal lines seem somewhat forgettable and the gang chorus feels slightly forced. Still, the riffwork is catchy, and it's not a bad song.\n\nThen we have \"Like Father, Like Son\", which takes us back to the more serious subjects. Lots and lots of riffs and tempo changes abound, and the song never stays the same for long. We start off with one slow, and absolutely crushingly heavy riff, then things speed up into an \u00fcber-catchy and vicious verse, to then slow down again with a sinister melodic riff over, and\u2026 well, then it goes on like that for about 8 minutes, shifting tempo countless times, blasting out numerous riffs and blistering solos, and then has the wicked atmosphere to boot. This owns you, like all fucking hell, and is another Exodus classic.\n\nBut then, the quality makes a sudden drop again, with \"Corruption\". This has it\u2019s share of nice riffwork like any song on the album, but nothing that really grabs you, neither in headbangability (I know that isn\u2019t a word) nor in extreme catchiness, so eventually it just comes off as somewhat uninteresting. The extended bridge has some potential with some more gang vocals and cool lyrics, but somehow it just fails to deliver. Another sub-par song.\n\nBut then, oh man, we jump straight back into the ownage. \"Verbal Razors\" has some of the cleverest lyrics I\u2019ve read: \u201cYou said your father died in Vietnam, but you\u2019re a bastard son with a whore for a mom! Mirror magnet, smelling like a rose, you plastic motherfucker, all you do is pose! Conceited, self-righteous and arrogant, your head is so hollow, there\u2019s enough room to rent! Little big man, so full of shit- Just shut up, you pathetic hypocrite!\u201d Holy fucking fuckshit yes, this is genius.\nOh yeah, and there\u2019s more. The riffs are unbelievably catchy and vicious as hell at the same time, and the shouting gang vocals give the vocals and lyrics an even more in-your-face attitude. Relentless, catchy as hell thrashing at it\u2019s very best, this is.\n\n\"Open Season\" has a far darker feeling and atmosphere, which is evident right from the first foreboding, sinister riff, which then kicks into more relentless riff madness. Vicious, fast-sung vocals with lyrics about brutal murder (\u201cI\u2019ll hunt you down and kill you for no apparent reason!\u201d) and of course the crazy riffwork. Yet another magnificent track, proving that Exodus was definitely one of the main forces of the Bay Area thrash scene.\n\nWe close with yet another mediocre cover, this time of AC/DC\u2019s \"Overdose\", which just doesn\u2019t do anything for me at all. A big meh, I say- they should\u2019ve kept this off the album and closed with \"Open Season\". And yes, I am aware that some copies don\u2019t include this song \u2013 but none of them should\u2019ve. It\u2019s not a downright bad song, just pretty pointless. It's just a weaker version of the genius original.\n\n\nOkay\u2026 so \"Fabulous Disaster\" has some of the greatest Exodus tunes ever, but also a few weaker ones. The two covers plus, and also also \"Corruption\" are all quite subpar, and make up nearly half of the album. And then \"Cajun Hell\" is pretty damn good, but not at all as neckbreakingly awesome as some other stuff on here.\nBut this album is definitely not a complete waste, because the other stuff is SO FUCKING GREAT! \"The Last Act of Defiance\", \"Fabulous Disaster\", \"The Toxic Waltz\", \"Like Father Like Son\", \"Verbal Razors\" and \"Open Season\" all own beyond belief, I\u2019d say they\u2019re all 10/10 in my book in fact. So all thrashers should definitely get this album, cause it has some of the best songs in the career of Exodus, it\u2019s just that the quality doesn\u2019t maintain throughout the entirety of the album. Oh well, Exodus still own you.\n",
        "\n\"Pleasures of the Flesh\" is one of those albums that rarely gets mentioned when discussing a band. But I don\u2019t see why; this is definitely a killer slab of thrash. It\u2019s no \"Bonded By Blood\", that\u2019s for sure, but what is?\nMost people seem to complain about the sound quality and heaviness (or lack thereof) but on the Century Media reissue that I\u2019ve got, the sound is pretty fucking killer. A bit sharper, cleaner and less raw than \"Bonded\", true, but still works very well and some of the riffs here really do tear shit up.\nThe biggest change though is of course that of vocalists. Paul Baloff was the fucking man, no arguments there, and Steve \u201cZetro\u201d Souza will never really be able to touch him. However, Zetro\u2019s generally higher pitched and rather menacing vocal style works very well with the more controlled and thought-out direction that the band seems to take with the songwriting.\nThe monster riffs are still there, but this is not an all out riff fest, there\u2019s a lot of other interesting elements abound as well, some better than others. \nA few examples of this are the bizarre intros found on some songs (\"Deranged\", \"Parasite\", and most notably the title track), showing a pretty humorous side that they\u2019d further explore eventually. But the songwriting in itself just isn\u2019t as manic and riff-after-riff based as that of the previous album, and that works pretty damn well on here. But make no mistake; this still manages to smash your face on over and over with riffs heavy as anvils. Check out the crushing fast-paced verse riff of \"Parasite\" for example. Or how \u2018bout the devastating but sinisterly melodic main riff of \"Deranged\"? And let\u2019s not forget\u2026 \"Chemi-Kill\"! The mellow intro drags on a bit, but when it gets going, that one riff is one of the best riffs I\u2019ve heard. Hell yes, the H-Team does not let up one bit in the kicking of your ass.\n\nAnother strength of the album is that it\u2019s very consistent, and to me doesn\u2019t really have any weaker songs. The midpaced \"\u2018Til Death Do Us Part\" is somewhat less awesome than the rest, but redeems itself somewhat with some really cool lyrics. Also, the short acoustic instrumental 30 Seconds is pretty damn useless, but that\u2019s easily forgivable, keeping in mind that it is only about 40 seconds (stupid inaccurate song title, it annoys me).\n\nBut aside from those two, this is all killer. The highlights would be the menacing \"Deranged\" (both lyrically and musically. \u201cThey think that they\u2019ve got me trained, but I know I\u2019m really deranged!\u201d Fun as shit to sing along to), the awesome, fast-paced Wild West song \"Faster Than You\u2019ll Ever Live To Be\" (featuring some of the coolest lyrics and catchiest vocals on here- and let\u2019s not forget about the riffs! That middle break especially is fucking nuts), and \"Chemi-Kill\", for that one riff alone. But \"Brain Dead\" is so damn catchy it\u2019s not funny. And then \"Seeds of Hate\" has some really fucking heavy moments awesome for headbanging (a bit of a shame that they made the main riff to slow down into this weird melodic section towards the end though), and of course the monstrous closer \"Choose Your Weapon\", which, simply put, slays.\n\nAll in all, with \"Pleasures of the Flesh\", Exodus definitely gave us a worthy follow-up to one of the best thrash albums around. Criminally underrated, this, and that\u2019s a bloody shame. Get it, and let Gary Holt and Rick Hunolt tear yourself a new asshole or three, as you \u201cFeel the power of your unholy death!\u201d Or something like that. Yeah, this kicks ass, get it.\n",
        "\nOkay, let me get this out of the way: If you don't own this and call yourself a thrash fan, Satan will come down for your soul and drink your blood and have his demons rape you until you die. \"Bonded By Blood\" is thrash at it's very fucking best- it's brutal, aggressive, intense, catchy as hell, and features lyrics about headbanging, drinking blood and the almighty Satan himself. It doesn't get better than this.\nThe music on here is absolutely insane. Most of the songs are just fast-as-hell headbanging monsters. Imagine the fastest songs from Metallica - \"Kill 'Em All\" (\"Hit The Lights\", \"Motorbreath\", or better yet, the final section of \"No Remorse\"!), and then multiply the intensity by a hundred times, and add an attitude more evil and in-your-face than Kreator's \"Pleasure To Kill\" and Slayer's \"Seasons In The Abyss\" combined. That's pretty much what's to be found here.\n\nBut it's not a sheer speed-machine. These guys also whip out some vicious midtempo crushers, namely \"And Then There Were None\", \"No Love\" and \"Deliver Us To Evil\". The first is pretty interesting, and features a very nice and somewhat melodic bridge and chorus, which adds up for some interesting variety. The later two are arguably the most evil sounding songs on the album (with strong competition from pretty much all the other songs on here...), and the vicious riffs will certainly have you headbanging shortly. And as if these three songs didn't own enough already, they all speed up towards the middle/end sections with some awesome riffage all over.\n\nAnd believe it or not, but I'd say these three are probably the weakest songs on here. The really good shit, is the fast stuff. We start right off with the demonic title track \"Bonded By Blood\". Fast, intense riffs, brutal attitude and lyrics from hell. \"Taste the sweet blood of one another, sharing without any greed. Bang your head as if up from the dead, intense metal is all that you need!\"\nAnd check out the fucking solo! This also is pretty similar to \"Kill 'Em All\", though again viciously intensified.\n\nAnd the raging thrash just continues, it never lets up. \"Exodus\", \"A Lesson In Violence\", \"Metal Command\", \"Piranha\" and \"Strike of the Beast\" - they're all just as fucking awesome as the title track. \"Metal Command\", \"A Lesson In Violence\" and \"Piranha\" stand out, but I could say the same about all songs. \"Exodus\" has the most brutal lyrics on here (\"Kick in your face and rape and murder your wife!!\") and some awesome riffage, \"Piranha\" has that ferocious verse riff, and \"Strike of the Beast\" has the most evil-sounding moment on the album, right on the middle section... \"Black as night, he begins his flight, wings outstretched in the cold...\" That part is so damn evil, it probably gives me goosebumps, though I'm headbanging too much to notice.\n\nOh yes, ladies and gentlemen, metal doesn't get much better than this. \"Bonded By Blood\" is one of those albums that from first listen will have you headbanging while screaming along and cutting your palm to drink your blood. \nThe blood-drinking process has been turned into a really lame goth procedure lately, and the Satanic lyric subject has been done to death. But these guys handle both these subjects with style, and manages to totally get you into it. \nWhat you really need to know is that Exodus' debut album is essential thrash, and an all-time classic of metal.\n",
        "\nThe title of this review describes my feelings in a nutshell about this album (OK, I downloaded it, sue me--can't afford to buy CDs that often these days), but I will elaborate anyway... \n\nI fondly remember the days of \"Bonded By Blood\", like everyone else, of course, and think that their first two albums are classics. \"Fabulous Disaster\" was good but not quite as good as the first two for me, and even though \"Impact Is Iminent\" was a pretty damn kickass effort, there is no forgiving \"Force Of Habit\"--it was sluggish and boring. And I was actually pretty relieved when they called it a day after that sad attempt. OK, now, fast forward to the present where, sadly, we have lost the mighty Paul Baloff and his truly psychopathic vocal presence, replaced by his, well, replacement, Steve \"Zetro\" Souza. I got irritated with his high scratchy squeal after a while back in the day, but the music was still good (mostly), so I tolerated that. And now we have \"Tempo Of The Damned\" and, well...HOLY MOTHERFUCK!!! HOLY MOTHER FUCKING FUCK!!!! \n\nThis album shreds everything in its path. And I do mean everything. The H-Team have a new lease and they are not wasting it for a second. Even old drummer Tom Hunting has returned and he kicks ass harder than a one-legged man in a contest. Fast, slow, everything in betwen, there is a new level of energy and fury in the Exodus camp, and no more of this silly \"Toxic Waltz\" crap, they are dead serious. It's nice to hear classic thrash played again with the same level of conviction and mania that existed in the olden days, and who better to bring it on back than Exodus, one of the pioneers? \n\n\"The Scar-Spangled Banner\" leads off with a brutal thrashing to the ears that doesn't let up for a second, and one of the first things I noticed was that Zetro's vocals are much more tolerable. He definitely gets the \"Most Improved\" award on this album by far with his different approach. He still has that high scratchy thing going, but he also incorporates a deeper, gruffer yelling style that sounds truly scary, which makes him much more tolerable in my book. Overall, his performance is the best I've ever heard from him. \"War Is My Shepherd\" is a great example of this with his bellows of \"WAAAAARRRR!!!!! WAR IS MY SHEPHERD!!!\" in the chorus, and he sounds like he will *not* be fucked with. And he does get in some nasty and barbed wordplay in tracks like one of my favorites, \"Culling The Herd\" (an ode to how stupid people shouldn't breed, something we all need to think of as AmeriKKKa goes further down the tubes): \"When will people realize/That people should be sterilized/And tubes are only fit to be tied?\". \n\nThe slower songs on this album are far from wussy, also, they crush! I disagree with some here in that slower tunes can be effective when placed properly in an album's course. I especially like \"Shroud Of Urine\" with its melodic twin-guitar part near the end of the solo section, \"Forward March\" with its catchy chorus and \"Throwing Down\" when Zetro really lets it all hang out. I could not find a duffer track on this entire album, and for me that's something I rarely say, contrary to what some may think. And rap influences? What the hell are you guys smoking? I don't hear anything of the sort, and that kind of cadence is so commonplace anyway I fail to see what teh big deal is about that. And hey, they take \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\", one of the all time classic attitude songs, and do it serious justice, so how can I complain? \n\nAnd the production is sterling as well, with clear and full guitars, growling bass that cuts through those guitars like a samurai sword, and whipcrack drumming. Whoever produced this knew their stuff, because it sounds perfect. \n\nReally, this is going to be one of the top albums of 2004, I can tell straight away. One of my top 3 if not Number One right where it belongs. Bring it on the road, boyos, I am dying to see them take it to the people! (And bring it to Houston while yer at it, eh?)\n",
        "\nThis album has been hyped since pretty much the reunion with Baloff in '97, and finally, seven years and one expired poseur-hunter later, it has arrived. Well, then - just what the fuck do we have here, and is it better than The Antichrist? We all know that's my gold standard for modern thrash - the textbook example of how things are Supposed to be Done.\n\nWell, Schmier and friends, move aside. You've been pwned. It's been a great three years on top of the thrash-heap, but competition has arrived, and it's killing time. Yes, kids, holy fucking shit is about right. THIS is the best thrash album of the past howevermany years - you know, since that time when there were thrash albums released every week, and some of them didn't suck, and mercifully none of them were The Gathering.\n\n[EDIT, FOLKS. I just, about a month after I wrote this Exodus review, heard the Torture Squad LP \"Pandemonium\" from 2003. THAT is the best thrash album of the past howevermany years. The fact that it wipes the floor with the new Exodus is merely a tribute to its \"HOLY FUCKING CHRIST\"ness, and not something to be held against the Slayteam and pals.]\n\nBut, I digress. Apparently, they decided that the 10-song promo that they released was going to be IT, and there was no song called 'Crime of the Century' after all, and no re-recording of 'Death Row', so well here it is. Slightly different in order than the promo, but all the assorted thrash parts are here, and when all is said and done, we've got a mighty impressive thrash entirety.\n\nFirst, before I describe all the highlights and drown in my own ejaculate matter, I must make a mention of what sucks about this album, and what brought it down from a rating like 93 or 94, which it would've gotten if not for the presence of the downer track called Throwing Down. It's better than Machine Head, and in fact in retrospect (about the 8th listen) I realise that it doesn't suck... it's just that when I had the promo, it came right between War is My Shepherd and Impaler, where it didn't make much sense in the order. But, after Sealed with a Fist it's a decent groover number though the \"throwing down... throwing down...\" part is a bit stupid. But hey, there's the rest of the album!\n\nOh, the rest. OH, THE REST!!! Jeebus H. Phineas T. Gage! I have had a large iron rod explosively hurled through my head, entering below the right ear and exiting around the left temple! I have survived and maintained consciousness, but this couldn't have been good for the old cerebrum. This is rule of the highest order. Thrash riffs abound - the best comparison I can come up with is Vio-lence's Oppressing the Masses, especially \"Officer Nice\", with that middle section that comes out of nowhere and forces you to kill your royal opponents in a brutal manner with a spork for two minutes? Well, about half the songs on here have such a Nice moment. Yes!!! \n\nThose songs include: Scar Spangled Banner, which also has some of the more hilarious Zetro lyrical masterpieces, in the form of \"not a patriot, just a hate-riot\" and others! Yes, Zetro still has it. Also, Shroud of Urine is similar, and then when they throw in that random Judas Priest sounding solo... MY GOD SOMETHING MUST HAVE GONE WRONG. I woke up this morning and my penis was missing. Same with Blacklist - they throw in that mosher riff and put the solo over it, and you're banging your head as if UP FROM THE DEAD (that's right kids, it's that good that it deserves this sort of a reference), and then they switch key and wouldn't you know it, it sounds excellently monkey-tacular with extra helpings of squid-sexuality! OH YES. RIFFS IST KRIEG. You say it's raining, I say give me back my clothes! I've added your name! TO MY BLACK LIST! The gang chorus at the end - dumb but effective. Kids, thrash isn't about having an IQ of 206 and coming up with creations like 'Dream Theater', which apparently I am too dumb to figure out.\n\nThen there's some slower songs... not stupid slow like Throwing Down, but good effective crunchers like Culling the Herd, which moves on and devours, forcing you to listen to those horrendously beautiful lyrics. Then, the slightly faster Sealed With a Fist, which is a really funny listen as well. \"Sixteen rounds - in case she missed!\" Heh heh, overkill seals your fate. Then, there's the controversial one - Forward March. I personally love the living fuck out of this song, but then again, I like old-school rap. Okay, let's all stop beating around the proverbial fire hydrant and admit it: Zetro raps in this song. \"I've got some news for you, you mother-fucker, there's a new man in town who isn't any sucker\". Except it doesn't suck the big P Diddly suck because it doesn't sample any classic Queen songs, it just rips you right the fuck apart while the guitars continue to shove their collective spikes into your worthless asshole. Then there's the inexplicable long melodic section - it's kind of a mishmash of a song, but it works like a motherfucker (who isn't any sucker). I should also mention the rather fast and Germanic-sounding title track... IMMORTAL SOUL! TAKES CONTROL!!! Bow to the tempo of the damned!!!!\n\nOh yeah, and then the two absolute highlights of the album. Impaler is actually from 1982. People don't seem to have picked up this fact, and more importantly, that 'fast section' that Grimmy lauded actually made its major-label debut in 1984 as a fucking Suckfuckandblowtallica riff. Because FUCKMETALLICA HAS RIPPED OFF EXODUS, JUST LIKE THEY RIPPED OFF EVERY OTHER BAND IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE. Motorhead called. We rock harder than you when we're asleep, you pussies. Venom called. We rock harder than you when we're fucking dead, you fucking pussies. Weapon called. We want 'Set The Stage Alight' back. Metal Church called. We kicked you out for a reason, and were heavier and thrashier, earlier. Overkill called. We invented thrash. We don't care what you say. FUCK YOU. Mustaine called. Quit milking it. Diamond Head called. No really, quit fucking milking it. And finally... EXODUS CALLED. Take Kirk out back, and shoot him in the fucking head. Fucking pussy traitor stealing all of Hunting's riffs and making them into Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death, etc. Yes, that fast part is indeed Trapped Under Impaler, and the song would've made Bonded by Blood if it weren't for the fact that Cuntallica literally stole the riff and put it on an album first. Thieving bunch of dildo-whores. And that was just them back in the 80s! Holy shit, you'd think they couldn't fall any further, but... \n\nWell, I'm not going to get into that. Because there's WAR!!! WAR!!! WAR IS MY SHEPHERD! This is the greatest thrash song of the last howevermany years. Again, apologies to Destruction, and apologies to NAILED TO THE FUCKING CROSS!!!! And apologies to Overkill, and THE SOUND YOU HEAR, IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, THE SOUND OF DYING!!! But now there's a new man in town (who isn't any... oh, you know the drill) and his name is PRAY FOR ALL OF THOSE IN PAIN!! FOR THOSE WHO DIED IN VAIN!!! Jesus! I beg of thee! Return me to the womb from which I was torn!! I SHIT MY PANTS AS I WAIT FOR THE REAPER! It's that good!!!\n\nOh hell yes. This album brings the pain to all of my orifices, causing discharges of a great variety of bodily fluids. It rapes - and murders! - your wife!! It is the logical successor to Bonded by Blood. Zetrodus has finally come around to being a lean, mean, shredding machine. FUCK YES. AND FOREVER AFTER, YOU CAN HEAR THE LAUGHTER!!!! Communism has eaten your pants!!!\n",
        "\nExodus is best known for Bonded by Blood, which is easily one of the greatest thrash albums of all time. But is this another Bonded by Blood? With the exception of one and 1/2 songs: hell no! For most songs, the formula is: water down Exodus' post-Bonded albums, shit on it with some half-thrash elements and hard rhymes, but add a few mildly redeeming features here and there, and viola, you have the new Exodus.\n\nThe bad? First of all, there are elements of hard rhyming (borderline rapping) in a few songs, though Zetro's vocals aren't bad for the most part. Combined with unnecessary use of profanity, even on the top of decent lyrics, it makes some songs almost fucking unlistenable. Secondly, cruddy half-thrash influences are everywhere, though it's not really derivative of anything that I can put my finger on. They seldom create that thrashy wall of sound that I so love, with all its brutality and polyriffed chaos -- it often sounds like Pantera or Machine Head sped up a bit, often relying on distortion and groove. Of course, the half thrash is all in the musicianship -- fortunately, there's no misplaced techno/industrial elements or anything. This would be a decent half-thrash album compared to the rest, though.\n\nThe good? The guitar solos fucking slay, though they're not over the top and stunning. The lead guitar is often pretty good. The production is excellent, and the instruments are all clear and pronounced, with a loud-as-hell yet crisp sound. However, I'm not sure what influence producer Andy Snead of Machine Head and Skinlab had in the music itself, since a good deal of this album would be better if it had the production of Capricornus' Stahlgewitter but the music of Bonded Like Blood instead of half-thrash.\n\nOh, and the exceptional one and 1/2 songs:\n\nImpaler REALLY fucking picks up at 1:45, though! It is sheer headbanging, back to the Bonded by Blood days true ass-kicking thrash, but only lasts little more than a minute, and then winds down for the rest of the song. GOD DAMNIT, why can't you do what you did on 1:45-3:03 for most the album!?! ARRGH! You would have equaled, if not exceeded Bonded with this album if you did!\n\nThe titular track (Tempo of the Damned) itself, though, is the true gem of the album. If the whole album sounded like this, it would easily get a 96% from me. It's in the vein of Bonded, but with viciousness, speed, and ferocity rivaling that of harsh German thrash. Everything is there: riffs from hell, aggressive drumming, vicious vocals, and a great solo tied together with the great production. It sounds exactly like what a modern Exodus should sound like! Why is it the only one like this?\n\nUnfortunately, most of the other songs have good and bad movements in them, but are generally just mediocre. Scar Spangled Banner isn't bad, but just ok. War is my Shepard sounds really promising at first, but goes downhill. Blacklist is crap. Shroud of Urine is crap, save for the solo. Forward March kicks ass for a brief moment, then goes from mediocre to UTTERLY LAME with rap elements. Culling the Herd is lousy Pantera worship, though I agree with the lyrics. Sealing the Fist and Throwing Down are also utter crap, and also sound like lost Pantera songs, though they're actually lost Wardance songs.\n\nI wish I could give rate this on a two-dimensional, time-based scale -- 96% for the actual thrash in the title track and a minute of Impaler, and a few parts in other songs like War is my Shepard. For most of the rest, it's about a 40% average, dipping into the single digits at times. A fair estimate for the album as a whole would be 57%, so that's what I'll give.\n",
        "\n(Note: this is a review of a burnt copy of the pre-release, but since it originated with Steve Souza, everything's definitely in order.)\n\nAfter over a decade of way more shit than any band should have to go through, Exodus has finally pulled themselves together and put out an album. With their legacy of brutal, riff-heavy thrash, their disappointing last couple albums, and all the hype surrounding \"the return of the Slay Team!\" Exodus has a lot to live up to with Tempo of the Damned. Do they deliver?\n\nSimply put - oh yeah. Tempo is a true beast of an album, a combination of ripping thrash and weighty groove reminiscient of Overkill's WFO, as well as of their own Fabulous Disaster. The guitars shred, the bass is powerful and very audible, the drums are fast and solid, and Steve Souza has never sounded this good in his life. As a matter of fact, the highlight of the album overall is probably Zetro's vocal ownage, in which he adds some Mille Petrozza near-growls (\"War Is My Shepherd\") and throat-ripping shrieks (\"Tempo of the Damned\") to his usual arsenal of snarls and squeals.\n\nAs for the songs, the major highlights are to be found at the beginning of the album; one of the best 1-2-3 punches I've heard in a long time in \"Scar Spangled Banner,\" the afore-mentioned \"Shepherd,\" and \"Blacklist.\" The opening track \"Banner\" is that rarest of creatures in modern years, an anti-war metal song done right. Remember \"Disposable Heroes\" and \"Two Minutes To Midnight\"? Exodus does, and they produced a fast-paced song with an excellently intricate main riff, great drumming, and an enraged, yet catchy chorus. \"Blacklist\" is a chugging track that reminds of \"And Then There Were None\"; while not as technical, \"Blacklist\" is damn catchy, and has a great intro riff that pops up again at the 3-minute mark and once more at about 5:30.\n\nIn between those, there's \"War Is My Shepherd,\" easily the album's finest hout, and probably the best Exodus song since \"Piranha.\" The riffs are speedy and fearsome, and the \"PRAY! For all of those in pain!\" rhythm of the pre-chorus is pure headbanging beauty. Then comes the chorus, with the aforementioned Germanic roars of \"WAR! WAR!\" Catchy, brutal, and violent\u2013Exodus at their best. You'll be screaming \"Praise the lord and pass the ammunition!\" by your second listen.\n\nNow, the bad. Unfortunately, Gary Holt saw fit to re-record a track (\"Throwing Down\") from his largely unsuccessful Wardance project; with no offense meant to Mr. Holt, I can see why Wardance didn't get anywhere. The opening riff isn't bad, but it gives way a boring, Machine Head-ish chug followed by a downright embarassing latter-day Pantera chorus. The vocal melody sucks too...an injustice to the rejuvenated Zetro.\n\nDespite that moment of disappointment, the Bay Area boys redeem themselves with the closing title track. The first two minutes of \"Tempo\" are faster than anything else on the album, and simply fucking KILL the listener. After a good midpaced solo, the speed kicks back in leading up to Souza's final vicious screams - great stuff.\n\nAnother notable track is the album epic, \"Forward March,\" which boasts a nice set of riffs as well as some questionable vocals that, while not really rap, honestly sound pretty crappy. The extended guitar solos in the middle rock, though, so the song turns out good. \"Shroud of Urine\" is a good, straightforward up-tempo triplet tune with cool lead work that sounds approximately eight hundred and sixty-four times better live. And then there's \"Impaler,\" which was left off Bonded for some reason, possibly Kirk Hammet riff burglary or simply space considerations. (Has anyone considered that KIRK might have written the riff? Just a thought...) In any case, yes, that is \"Trapped Under Ice\" in the middle, yes, it is an awesome riff no matter who came up with it, and yes, this song fucking murders .\n\nWhile not quite a mind-boggling effort, Tempo of the Damned proves that thrash metal is alive and well on the Left Coast, and is a great listen for anybody yearning for the days when men were men, women wore Death Angel babydolls, and only poseurs cut their hair. Vicious, solid and reassurring.\n",
        "\nThis is the last full length studio album that Exodus have released...and really is quite good. My first impression by the opening riff on Thorn in My Side is to scream \"Thrash!!!\"..and for the most part...that is the proper way to go...but the album is a bit on the hard rock side...let me try and explain. In a way...the style of Thrash greatly reminds me of Overkills style of Thrash...a product that isn't too intense (but nonetheless substantially intense)..but is full of power and pure energy...you know...Thrash that rocks. But in another way...this album reminds of bands like Skid Row...no...not the rocker ballads...pop in \"Slave to the Grind\" and you will understand what kind of rocking metal style I mean. Anyways, this album is just a rocking Thrash album...not insanely intense and in your face like their early stuff...but full of power nonetheless.\n\nThe album starts out with killer riffs like I said...and continues to pound out some pretty awesome riffs throughout the album. The guitar tone is a bit questionable though...at times it seems fitting...but for the most part is a quite a bit bass heavy and can get a little bit iritating at certain points (EDIT - The tone isn't really bad at all once you listen to a few songs...it really works for the album and its heavy riffing that comes into full effect around track number 5 or 6 and hits a peak at \"Architect of Pain\"). The vocals can also get a little bit iritating as Souza has a tendency to be a little bit weak and unpowerful at times...though he does quite well of this album. Good soloing and pretty decent lyric writing...creative melodies also...so for the weaknesses of this album..they are made up for well.\n\nThe best songs on the album are probably Thorn in My Side, Fuel for the Fire, Count Your Blessings...infact I am listeing to CYB right now and this song is absolutely fucking crushing man....I would rank this with some of the best Exodus songs....also add Architect of Pain to that list of great Exodus songs...this song is absolutely awesome...reminds me of Deliver Us to Evil...anyways....most songs on this album are actually pretty damn good...with the exception of the cover of the Rolling Stones - Bitch...which isn't bad..just doesn't really suite my fancy or mesh with the album as well as another song would have...although it does mesh simi-well. As I listen to this album I am really noticing how well it flows from each song to the next. There are a ton of awesome tracks on this cd. At first listen it might be a little tough to stomach though...but even if you compare it to...lets say \"Bonded By Blood\" I don't think it will take very long for anyone who is into Thrash or Metal in general to appreciate it. This is one of those high end good...but not great Thrash albums that are overlooked...there seems to be an absolute plethora of those.\n\nThis album is heavy, musically intelligent, well-produced, and well written. FULL OF FUCKING HEAVY ASS CREATIVE RIFFING!!!! If you are even a remote fan of Exodus you should own this...and if you are a fan of Overkill's work..then you will appreciate this album....since Souza sounds a lot like Blitz..especially on this album...and since the approach they take to this album is very similar to Overkills approach to Metal...comparable to \"Horrorscope\" in my opinion. A very safe buy for any Metal Head.\n",
        "\nOne day I was at Record Exchange looking for a good haul. I meet this guy who was my age but during the 80's and totally into thrash metal. He recomended me this album. I was a little leery at first cause I heard so many bad things about it. Well I bought it and at first I didn't really care for it. But the other day I got it off the shelf and decided to give it another spin. This album has got some fucking killer riffs. It definitly isnt like there earlier album, Bonded by Blood. But thrash was starting to die off in the 90's and bands were having trouble staying true. The album starts off with Thorn in My Side. This song gots some good heavy riffin some good singing. The song definitly sets the tone for the rest of the album displaying a good try for thrash but just not. Me, Myself & I has a kick ass intro... but the chorus lacks a bit, still a good song. I'm going to skip through the album cause \"most\" of the songs are good but not worth a whole lot of mentioning. Good Day to Die has a very awesome acoustic intro, probably my favorite song on this album. Feeding Time at the Zoo tries to be thrash, doesnt quite succed but the funny lyrics makes a good mix for the song. There really are some weak songs on here. The song Bitch mixes some kind of groove rock with brass instruments and totally doesn't work. Pump It Up would be another song I would say is weak. Its got this cool bridge riff, but the verse and chorus riffs clash to much with the crappy vocals at this part making it sound terrible. I recomend this album if you really like Exodus, but if your looking for a thrash metal album this isn't for you.\n",
        "\nFor 1983, this is pretty thrashy stuff. Conclusive proof that Exodus were among the first of the thrash bands. This rehearsal is with Gary Holt (after a series of lead guitarists that revolved in and out of the band after Hammett left), and contains four songs off Bonded by Blood, and one that surely would have made it if not for the opportunists down the street that wrote a song based on Hunting and Hammett riffs and called it a Hetfield/Ulrich composition.\n\nBut, I digress... you like Bonded by Blood? SURE YA DO!!! You'll like this too - a bit rougher around the edges, but the viciousness is all there, and the nifty riff work and also Gary Holt's hugely underappreciated soloing. The thing really worth getting is of course Dying By His Hand, which sounds like a sloppier and far more fun version of Creeping Death. The under-verse riff isn't nearly as well defined but the chorus riff. Oh yes.\n\nAlso, I must note that Bonded By Blood is COMPLETE in under 3 minutes. Fast and furious.\n\nTHOU SHALT BANG!\n\nGood solid stuff to be found here! Man, if this had been finally released on an album in 1984, not 1985...\n",
        "\nOh my fucking goodness, if they had released this album as they had planned in 1984, this would have been so fucking lethal. Exodus would be universally recognised as the GODS of thrash metal, and Metallica's \"Ride the Lightning\" would've been an afterthought. \n\nEven for 1985, when albums like \"Hell Awaits\" and \"Seven Churches\" were setting new standards, this album is a lethal dose of fucking brutality. The songs here are just sick - especially when heard live, but even on the studio album they come out sounding very sharp and very heavy. Some really good production here, that accents the riff work of Holt and Hunolt, and Baloff's fucking destructive vocal style. \n\nWhat's lost in many reviews, though, is the melodic sense that this album has. Especially Gary Holt's work, which includes lots of really nice guitar leads, and also a general idea of how to make songs catchy. Witness \"And then There Were None\" for example, which has a very memorable melody under the chorus. \n\nHighlights: the title track, because any band that encourages banging your head INTO physical objects is just too fucking great for words. Also, \"Piranha\", and \"No Love\" and \"Exodus\" - Hell, they're all really fucking solid. No ballads, not even the occasional silly midpaced moment, this is balls-out brutal thrash metal.\n",
        "\nThe Exodus attack is back (or was, as it seems they broke up AGAIN...) with a 'reunion' live album. But don't let that scare you off. If you're one of the three people in the world who didn't hear about this, this isn't that 'Toxic Schmaltz' stuff - the reunion is of the only Exodus lineup that was worth a shit, the first one, which featured the unique vocal talents of Paul \"Buddy Hackett\" Baloff (well, they also couldn't dig up Rob McKillop, so they dragged in Gary Holt's Wardance bassist Jack Gibson, but believe me, it's a BIG improvement...). For the set list, they also focused exclusively on the songs from the Baloff-era of the band - everything from the first album except for Metal Command, three songs from the second album that Baloff did demos for before getting the boot, and the demo-era song Impaler (co-written and later ripped off by Kirk Faggett for the Metallica song \"Trapped Under Ice\"). \n\nHowever, a great set list doesn't automatically guarantee that the performance will be worth a shit, but the band did a fantastic job - the tempos were even faster than back in the day, the H-team nailed literally EVERY solo perfectly, and I dare say that Paul Baloff's vocals were even MORE OTT than they were fourteen years ago. Also present were Baloff's unique stage banter, full of threats to posers and bad jokes on the song titles. Also for another little bonus (if you give a shit about Machine Head, that is...), Robb Flynn takes over on guitar for the song \"A Lesson In Violence\". The only other thing that might turn off the classic fans is the sound - it's uncompromisingly 'modern' in sound, from the clean, slick obviously digital recording to the blatantly 90's solid-state guitar distortion, but for me the feel and attitude of the band keeps it firmly rooted back in 1985 (as does some of the stage banter - the band relentlessly heckles the idiots who shout out for Toxic Waltz - \"this it a fuckin' history lesson, motherfucker!\"). If you're the kind who laments the demise of vinyl you might want to try before you buy, but anyone with an interest in classic mid-80s thrash in general and Exodus in particular should end up liking this. \n\n(Originally published at LARM (c) 1999)\n"
