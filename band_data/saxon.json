        "\nAfter the lacklustre cover album Inspirations, British heavy metal veterans Saxon come around with a brand-new release featuring ten new songs for a total running time of forty-four minutes. Sadly, the band's twenty-fifth studio album is no improvement over its predecessor and bores with old-fashioned genre stereotypes without any creativity, passion or wit.\n\nThings start on a low note with the opening title track ''Carpe Diem (Seize the Day)'' that repeats the title to death to a point that it almost becomes a brainwashing session by listening comprehension.\n\n''The Pilgrimage'' shows how an interesting idea can be entirely wasted. The song evokes an epic atmosphere with almost cinematic vibes at the start. Sadly, the band doesn't develop anything upon that idea and simply stretches that one idea to an insufferable length of six and a half minutes.\n\n''Lady in Grey'' suffers from a similar issue. The song tries to evoke a mysterious atmosphere reminding slightly of psychedelic rock stylistics of the late sixties. However, the unusual idea isn't pushed any further and the track plods along without any energy for more than five sleep-inducing minutes.\n\nTo be fair, Saxon's new record isn't entirely bad and includes at least two reasonably decent tunes. ''Age of Steam'' is a heroic heavy metal anthem with atmosphere and grit that manages to stay on your mind after a first try.\n\nThe closing ''Living on the Limit'' clocks in at less than three minutes and convinces with powerful speed and tight chemistry in the instrumental department.\n\nTwo very good songs out of ten are however not enough to give this release any attention or to even justify a potential purchase. Saxon needs to improve two elements in order to capitalize on some of its promising ideas. First and foremost, they need some desperate help in the songwriting department to develop their concepts beyond the initial stage. Secondly, the band has to keep its songs energetic, short and tight as the band sounds especially tiresome in the long and plodding tunes.\n\nSaxon's twenty-fifth studio album Carpe Diem is only recommended to avid collectors and faithful fans. There are numerous other heavy metal bands, both experienced veterans and fresh newcomers, who have by now outclassed Saxon who are living on their reputation of yore. The band hasn't released an entirely convincing record in quite some time now. While the band is still great in concert, the group's recent material is quite forgettable.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to music, I always try to be positive. One of my fundamental principles is that I believe that creativity doesn\u2019t cease with age. If a band have released great music in the past, my point of view is that are able to do it again, wether it be 2 years later och 20 years later. For that reason, I have always had an open mindset when it comes to new music released by legacy bands. Unlike many, I am always eager to hear what these bands have come up with in recent times, and I never rule out the chance of these bands releasing a new classic. \nHowever, sometimes it gets to a point where even I have to re-consider things. If there is one thing that has disturbed my musical mind in the last decade, it is the fact that many legacy bands have fallen victims of what I often refer to as the \u201dAndy Sneap-trap\u201d. This trap can refer to a lot of things, but when push comes to shove, it can more or less be reduced to two things. \n\n1. A nostalgic and stripped-down approach in terms of sound and songwriting.\n\n2. A compressed, modern production with an absence of musical dynamics, often driven by the visions of producer Andy Sneap.\n\nWhen writing this, I must emphasize that I don\u2019t discount Andy Sneap of principle. In the early 00s, he played a major role in revitalizing the careers of bands like Megadeth, Exodus and Testament, and for that he shall be praised. However, in the last decade he seems to have been obsessed by a certain soundscape and a desire to use this soundscape for EVERY band he works with. This includes major metal acts like Judas Priest, Accept, Saxon, Testament and Overkill. The outcome has been a metal landscape that IMO is devoid of originality, genuineness and ambition. \n\nIf you look at some of the most classic albums from the bands mentioned, they all had a unique, distinctive sound. Something that set them apart from other, contemporary bands and albums. Nowadays, the albums released by these bands are more or less a copy of their latest one and a copy of the albums released by the other bands. They sound the same and are built upon the same musical ingredients. If you discount the vocals, which is the only thing that differs the bands from each other, it sounds like all these albums could have been released by the same band. As far as I\u2019m concerned, hiring Andy Sneap as your producer is the same as to say that you don\u2019t care about originality and creativity any more, and that your only goal is to release albums for the sake of releasing albums. It\u2019s a sad state really. If I\u2019m going to point out something positive about this, it is that Andy Sneap at least prevents the bands from releasing abominations like \u201dEat The Heat\u201d, \u201dRisk\u201d or \u201dForce To Habit\u201d. With Andy Sneap at the helm, you will never release a 0/10 album. On the other hand, you will never release a 10/10 album either. What you\u2019ll get is basically albums that varie between 6/10 and 8/10, and a situation where some albums work better than others.\n\nYou may wonder why I waste my and your time with this rant? Well, because the album this review is written for, Saxon\u2019s latest album \u201dCarpe Diem\u201d from 2022, can best be described as the latest addition to this monotonic mess. I\u2019ve been a Saxon fan for many years and even if I haven\u2019t heard all their albums yet, I\u2019ve heard more than enough to know what I can expect from the band. For that reason, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard their second to last album, \u201dThunderbolt\u201d from 2018, as that album showed a hungry, ambitious band that wanted to show the world they could still deliver the goods, but also a mature band that could use their experience to improve their songwriting and overall ability to create something memorable. Therefore, it was a disappointment to hear that \u201dCarpe Diem\u201d didn\u2019t have any of those things. \nThe songwriting on this album is very safe and predictable, to the point of being bland and boring, and nothing strikes you as truly memorable. Overall, this album is surrounded by the same sense of conformity and laziness that Andy Sneap\u2019s production is, and the fact that the album was produced by him also gives it the exact same sound as you would hear on a Testament, Overkill, Accept and Judas Priest album. So there is literally nothing new, fresh and original under the sun. It seems to me that Andy Sneap\u2019s way of doing things has influenced the band\u2019s creative process, and not in a positive way. The only thing that is remarkable about \u201dCarpe Diem\u201d is how extremely unremarkable it is.\n\nWhat about the actual songs on the album you may wonder? Well, the sad thing is that there isn\u2019t much to say. The songs are basically metal by numbers, surrounded by a feel of being written on auto-pilote. As with any album, you will find songs that you like more than others. In this instance, songs like the title track, \u201dAge Of Steam\u201d, \u201dSuper Nova\u201d and \u201dLiving On The Limit\u201d might contribute to boost my enjoyment of the album, but it would be a stretch to call them genuinly amazing. They just happen to be the most enjoyable songs on an overall mediocre and faceless affair. On the other hand, there is no songs that I would consider to be awful or even weak. They are just mediocre and bland all the way through. And perhaps that\u2019s where the biggest problem lies. Say what you want about turds like \u201dRisk\u201d and \u201dEat The Heat\u201d, but at least you remember them. It might not be for positive reasons, but you can at least talk about them. With \u201dCarpe Diem\u201d, it\u2019s hard to even talk about it, since I feel like there is nothing to talk about. To me, it is actually impressive how much this album lacks replay value. If anything, this is the type of album that will be listened to 2-3 times before being put to a shelf and never be played again. \n\nYou may think I\u2019m too harsh with this review. Can I really have such high expectations on a band that has been around for 40+ years and most likely have retired in 5-10 years? Yes, I can. Iron Maiden has been around for as long as Saxon, yet they still find ways to reinvente themselves and push their creative boundaries. I know Saxon can do that too. They showed it 3 years ago when they released \u201dThunderbolt\u201d, and it makes me disappointed to hear that they couldn\u2019t do it again. If they would have invested more time in the music, and actually tried to create something fresh and original, would this album have been better? I want to believe so.\n\nLike I said, \u201dCarpe Diem\u201d is not an unique case. If anything, it can be considered as the latest prey to the \u201dAndy Sneap-trap\u201d, the trend that has plagued the heavy metal landscape in the last decade. The most frustrating thing though, is that both the bands themselves and the majority of the fans refuse to acknowledge this problem. Don\u2019t the bands want to be creative anymore? Are they just phoning it in? It seems to me they are. And don\u2019t the fans want to hear something more creative than this? Don\u2019t they have demands? It seems to me they don\u2019t. I know I have, because I know what these bands are actually capable of, and as long as they continue to create lazy, uninspired music like this, I will not talk about their modern music in positive terms. Sadly. If this is the route they decide to go on, they might as well retire, because then their days of creativity and innovation are over. Thank god I have broadened my horizons and made myself open to more modern metal. If I hadn\u2019t, I definitely would have been lost in this monotonic mess.\n",
        "\nCarpe Diem \u2013 Seize the Day. I guess this is quite a good motto that Saxon have chosen for their newest (their 23rd!!!) studio album. I would say that they sound powerful and heavy like they didn't sound for many years on this output and so they have done the best out of the situation. Most of the tracks are pretty fast or in some upper mid-tempo area and full of awesome guitar solos that let you be astonished that these guys still have such energy for this after all those years. I mean, they are not getting younger, if you know what I mean. If I didn't know that it was Saxon I would guess that some guys in their 30s/40s are performing a pretty great classic heavy metal album.\n\nThe album starts with a very catchy banger which is also the title track. I would state that this is a perfect opener for an album because it puts you in a right mood for this. Very casual riffs come along with a well-timed drumming and Biffs vocals do the rest to create a future Saxon classic. 'The Age Of Steam' is another very appealing track that reminds me quite a bit of Rammstein's \u201cDeutschland\u201d right at the beginning. It's another very melodic track with a furious chorus and again you can get quite easy into it. By the way the story that is told here (about the industrialization) is pretty nice to follow. There are quite a couple of tracks that keep up this mid-tempo style and are really great bangers like 'Super Nova'. I would say that this is one of the heaviest tracks that Saxon have ever written. The guitar riffs are razor sharp and quite brutal and I have to admit that the track reminds me from its riffing and the chorus of my Judas Priest all-time fave, that one with the ugly motorbike on it, you know for sure! Another track that I would like to mention is 'Dambusters', maybe not because of the music (though it is a really good one with a lot of Rock n\u00b4Roll flair- Lemmy would love that one for sure) but because of the lyrics. It is quite an interesting topic from WW2, when British bombers were sent to Germany to bombard the dams of the water reservoirs in the Sauerland and Hesse to harm the Ruhr Area and other parts of Germany because there was one of the hotspots for the war industry. This is quite an interesting story that the one or the other may like to read about in more detail.\n\nOn the other hand there are some slow tracks on Carpe Diem, too \u2013 namely 'The Pilgrimage' and 'Lady In Gray'. While 'The Pilgrimage' is a quite outstanding track that sounds a little bit like 'Crusader' and appears to be very catchy and groovy (combined with some \u201cHells Bells\u201d vibes), 'Lady In Gray' is the only track that I can't get used to. It sounds quite lame and boring in my ears and really doesn't grip me. May it be because of the half-hearted synths or the somewhat generic chorus, this track just splashes along without too much excitement in it, sorry. I would like to state that just one weaker track on this album isn't so much worth to criticize even because all of the other tracks are very rousing and make the album a very entertaining event.\n\nHopefully Saxon will keep this power they preserved on Carpe Diem for some more years and present us more of this stuff!!\n\nRating: 9.3 out of 10 Super Novae\n\nOriginally written for metalbite.com\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s hard to believe the boisterously titled Denim and Leather, released in 1981 and therefore only two years after Saxon\u2019s self-titled debut album, was already the band\u2019s fourth full-length studio recording. Then again, young up-and-coming bands releasing studio albums in quick succession was not out of the norm in the olden days, when a band selling lots of records could still make a decent buck\u2014unlike today, when generally lower record sales will force musicians striving to make a living to tour almost endlessly in order to make their art at least somewhat profitable.\n\nDenim and Leather was of course released during the heyday of the legendary New Wave of British Heavy Metal and can only be judged properly within the context of that seminal era in the history of heavy metal. Younger metalheads eager to learn more about the roots of the genre and deciding to give some of the ol\u2019 classics a spin might initially have a hard time getting into this, because compared to metal music of more recent provenance, stuff like Denim and Leather might actually sound rather tame. With the advances in recording technology and the genre\u2019s propensity to constantly become heavier, faster and louder, a lot of the metal put out in the early eighties may sound only half as menacing today as it did some forty years ago. Heck, even Saxon\u2019s own studio output since about the mid 1990s sounds heavier than their classic early stuff, which from today\u2019s perspective often comes across more like biker-themed hard rock rather than pure heavy metal.\n\nThen again, even while acknowledging that four decades have gone by, there\u2019s no denying that Denim and Leather, at least next to slightly more muscular early releases such as Wheels of Steel and Strong Arm of the Law, already introduced a somewhat more commercial, radio-friendly side to the band\u2019s sound. Even back then, a more lightweight track like \u201cOut of Control,\u201d with lyrics that read like a heartfelt love poem dedicated to Biff\u2019s girlfriend at the time, certainly wasn\u2019t the heaviest \u201cshit\u201d around. It\u2019s still a solid rocking tune, but it won\u2019t exactly make you, uh, lose control when spinning it on your stereo.\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s plenty of faster, more aggressive material on Denim and Leather, with tracks like the furious \u201cPrincess of the Night\u201d (almost kind of a proto-speed metal affair), the defiantly self-endorsing \u201cNever Surrender,\u201d the pugnacious \u201cRough and Ready\u201d or the thundering biker-themed \u201cMidnight Rider\u201d charging along at a stout pace and boasting a harder, more uncompromising edge. However, the heaviest of the bunch is, without a doubt, the splendid \u201cAnd the Bands Played On.\u201d This is definitely the best song on here, with a really muscular main riff, a catchy chorus and lyrics conveying a sense of excited expectation. Unfortunately, at under three minutes, it is also the shortest track on the album. The ripping \u201cFire in the Sky\u201d is another surprisingly fast cut with some nice dual guitar harmonies to boot.\n\nThe title track, placed at the very end of the track list\u2014something more bands should do\u2014ends things on a very high note. It is probably the most well-known tune on here and it captures the band effectively firing on all cylinders. Featuring a more march-like pace, a powerful and punchy main riff as well as a fist-pumping chorus guaranteed to stick in your head forever (\u201cdenim and leather, brought us all together, it was you that set the spirit free\u201d), this is hard-hitting arena rock in the best sense of the term, as it was definitely intended to be played live in front of a rabid audience of thousands of people, a sentiment echoed by the added crowd chants underlying the chorus in the final minute of the song. The guitar solo is also one of the best you will find on this release, rounding off a great track that rightfully belongs among the most iconic of Saxon\u2019s long and storied career.\n\nThe recording quality is actually really good considering how long ago Denim and Leather came out, but as was mentioned before, there are certainly aspects giving away its age. The guitars in particular lack some of the crunch and \u201cbite\u201d you would expect from a more modern production. This detriment is, however, offset by the overall transparency of the recording, rendering every instrument clearly audible and giving the drums an unexpectedly good punch. Moreover, the bass guitar shows up strong in the mix and makes a vital contribution to the overall sound. It\u2019s safe to say a cut like \u201cMidnight Rider\u201d would not be nearly as effective without Steve Dawson\u2019s rumbling bass pushing it forward.\n\nAt the end of the day, Denim and Leather is a rock-solid hard rock/heavy metal record with plenty of enjoyable songs, two absolute highlights in \u201cAnd the Bands Played On\u201d and the title track, but also some mediocre moments causing it to rank a tier below its two immediate predecessors and even further below the material a comparable band such as NWoBHM mates Iron Maiden was putting out at roughly the same time with albums like Iron Maiden or Killers, which arguably were more aggressive and more forward-thinking. Nonetheless, Saxon\u2019s Denim and Leather is a fun affair and recommended listening for anyone with at least a passing interest in the early days of the genre.\n\nChoicest cuts: Princess of the Night, And the Bands Played On, Midnight Rider, Denim and Leather\n\nRating: 7.5 out of 10 points\n",
        "\nThe market has recently been flooded with cover albums. Some of them were great such as Anubis Gate's creative, experimental and surprising Covered in Colours. Others were decent such as Beyond the Black's diversified, inspired and intimate W:O:A Acoustic Clash (The Lockdown Session). Others yet again were fairly average such as BlutEngel's danceable, formulaic and melodic Fountain of Destiny. Some releases were slightly underwhelming like Billy Joe Armstrong's old-fashioned, predictable and uninspired No Fun Mondays. Saxon's Inspirations is however the worst of all those cover albums and can only be described as mediocre at best.\n\nThe problem starts with a look at the track list. This album includes eleven old-fashioned tunes with a timid running time of thirty-six minutes that have mostly been covered on numerous occasions already.\n\nThe quality of the tracks is another issue. The overlapping vocals in the opening ''Paint It Black'' by The Rolling Stones sound mildly confusing. Led Zeppelin's ''Immigrant Song'' lacks the power of the original tune in the vocal department. The same goes for the lackluster rendition of AC/DC's ''Problem Child''.\n\nTo be fair however, some of the covered tracks sound decent. Crow's ''Evil Woman'' surprises with dominant bass guitar sounds that add a healthy dose of energy. Toto's ''Hold the Line'' finds the perfect balance between energy and melody thanks to its gritty guitar play. Other positive elements are the warm production that blends in appropriately and the cool cover artwork.\n\nAt the end of the day however, this album is only interesting for die-hard Saxon fans. For everyone else, this album is only useful as background music recalling classic rock tracks while doing something else. This release would have been a nice gimmick as a bonus disc of a regular album but isn't worth to be purchased on its own.\n",
        "\nWith the three albums preceding Destiny, which are Crusader, Innocence Is No Excuse, and Rock the Nations, Biff Byford and Crew attempted to simplify and commercialize much of their sound in order to attain further mainstream success for the band, but they didn't see much fruit becoming of their labor. Given these circumstances, before them, they probably saw two choices: to go back to their traditional heavy metal roots and attempt to emulate the classic sound of their first four records, or further descend into the dark cesspool of glam and pop rock. To the chagrin of their fans at the time (and for our amusement today), Saxon chose to go all-in into sappy bubblegum music in one final attempt to revitalize their career. Destiny, the ultimate culmination of Saxon's lust for this furthered mainstream success, was born... and it flopped. Of course, Saxon would move onto greener pressures soon after Destiny's release and regain their metal edge, but the fact is that they had just released a fancy drink coaster that would forever be the single largest blemish in their career, being seen as on par with such masterpieces as Cold Lake and Stronger Than Ever by Celtic Frost and (Grave) Digger, respectively. With this reputation in mind, Saxon's Destiny is an album that I feel somewhat embarrassed about liking.\n\nTruthfully, Destiny shares very few characteristics with its predecessors. For one, Destiny contains very little in the way of true metal riffage, with most of that being found on its second side. Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver predominately play either simple picked notes or basic melodic hard rock chords; the guitars are no longer in the forefront of the sound of the music. Consequently, much more focus is put onto Byford's vocal melodies and synths. And of course, these synths have probably the most cheesy and syrupy sound imaginable; I can see where Sabaton got their samples. This is really the deal breaker for most who listen to Destiny, and I agree, they can be mildly annoying. Case in point has to be \"We Are Strong.\" The verses are energetic and lively enough, but that chorus, man; it's like late 80's Europe on steroids laced with mozzarella and gorgonzola. Even after stating this though, I must admit that cheese suites my palate, and so I still kind of like this song. That's the most I'll admit, anyway. Vapid in a completely different way though is \"Where the Lightning Strikes.\" You'd expect a song about electricity and, well, lightning (at least figuratively) to be vivacious. The listener should feel that three hundred million volts of electricity hitting their body, but no, \"Where the Lightning Strikes\" is feckless, slow, plodding, and wastes your time (4:18 seconds, to be precise) getting to the rest of the album. I suppose Byford wants to be where the lightning strikes, as detailed by the chorus, but he isn't at this location, which would explain the sluggishness of the whole ordeal.\n\nNow, there are other songs in Destiny that share this air of cheesiness, but unlike the two aforementioned tracks, Saxon did a good job with the other ones made with this line of thinking. Two tunes that do sappiness correctly are \"I Can't Wait Anymore\" and \"Song For Emma.\" Yes, these songs are slow, overly maudlin ballads that many individuals will still find kitsch, primarily due to the presence of the synths. Despite this, I still can't help but enjoy them. Perhaps it was ironic amusement at first, but I actually believe they are well done ballads with punchy through lines and catchy melodies. Byford is a lot more versatile a singer than he is given credit for, and he sings these tracks with conviction and sentimentality. \"S.O.S\" and \"Calm Before the Storm\" are more rocking tracks more like \"We Are Strong,\" but they aren't nearly as repugnantly \"happy\" as that particular tune, which makes them much better. The latter especially really sees Byford soar over the verses in a really memorable way. And I haven't even mentioned the opener, \"Ride Like the Wind.\" The original song was some pop rock/disco song by Christopher Cross, you know, some really appealing stuff (okay, it isn't that bad). Luckily, in perhaps Saxon's best decision having to do with Destiny, they refined the song into a brisk and catchy hard rock anthem; it's difficult to tell that this isn't even an original song by the band. \n\nNow, as to not completely alienate their long-time fans (hahahaha), Saxon did throw in some faster numbers on Destiny, which are focused on Side B (three songs, to be precise). These songs were mostly spared from the tyranny of 80's glam rock, but oddly enough the best of the trio is the one with the most of this influence, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\" It's the slowest out of the bunch, but the dramatic chorus with all the vocal layers is an ear-worm, and the lyrics being about the regrettable split between West and East Germany adds a nice touch to the song. The other two quicker tunes, \"Red Alert\" and \"Jericho Siren,\" are more in the line of earlier Saxon, both being more straightforward, having jumpy riffing sections, and more shreddy guitar solos. Much like the rest of the album, however, there still is more attention being put on melody rather than aggression here, so they don't quite have the same intensity as some of their earlier Saxon brethren. Yet, they are still solid songs, and end of the album on a high note. \n\nI, for one, am rather glad that Saxon eventually found their way once more and did not completely die by the end of the 80's due to Destiny's cold reception. Much of their later material is better than Destiny could ever aspire to be really, as much as it absolutely pains me to declare (of course their earlier albums are better as well). This album is much like Rush's Presto in that while there is not much I really loathe on each record, they simply do not compare in scope or ambition to the popular albums of each band, respectively. I am not going to sit here and claim everyone is wrong about Destiny, and anyone who dislikes it isn't a true fan of the band. Destiny is reviled for a reason by metalheads; it is the band's ultimate sellout, cash-grab record. I will claim, however, that it is verily a well-written and performed sellout record. If you don't mind glam rock or pop rock, you'll probably like the record as whole. If not, then avoid all that sucrose, and hopefully at least you'll enjoy the faster tracks.\n",
        "\nFollowing the departure of original guitarist Graham Oliver, Saxon gradually grew into too much of a German-styled power metal band. This is not to discredit his follow-up Doug Scarratt, who is probably the best musician to ever play with the band, but the beefy, modern production jobs on their later albums don\u2019t quite carry the charm of their earlier works, which were very much reminiscent of the time when hardrock and heavy metal weren\u2019t actually seperate things yet. There is one exception to this rule however: 2004\u2019s \u2018Lionheart\u2019, an album which is still bombastic, but also has the dynamics of early Saxon.\n\nUpon first glance, \u2018Lionheart\u2019 is not that much of a departure from the other twenty-first century Saxon albums. This is quite obviously a Charlie Bauerfeind production, with the guitars sounding crispy clear and the drums sounding huge. \u2018Lionheart\u2019 just feels less like Saxon going through the motions than many of their other recent albums. There are some ambitious tracks that undoubtedly are inspired by the possibilities modern studio technology gave the Brits, but there are also some more triaditional hardrock and heavy metal riffs to be heard this time around. And most of the choruses actually stick without trying too hard.\n\nThe song that initially attracted my attention was the title track of the album, a work that is quite progressive by Saxon standards. It is not very common for Saxon to play around with the time feel of songs, especially not to slow down for the chorus. The normal time feel of the verses contrasts nicely with the stomping nature of the half time feel that transforms the chorus into a chant, while the use of clean guitars and interesting chord work further enhances the song. Biff Byford\u2019s vocal performance also counts as one of the most commanding in his career.\n\n\u2018Lionheart\u2019 contains significantly more enjoyable material, however. \u2018English Man \u2018O\u2019 War\u2019 is easily one of the most traditional Saxon songs in ages, while \u2018Man And Machine\u2019 is an equally uncomplicated stomper that will appeal to old school metalheads. The driving triplet riffs and rhythms that carry \u2018To Live By The Sword\u2019 are engaging enough to forgive the clich\u00e9 lyrics of the chorus, especially considering the sublime harmonies that sing them. The intense midtempo stomper \u2018Justice\u2019 \u2013 another track with a chorus that opens up the entire song \u2013 is one of the most underrated gems in Saxon history and the aggressive speed metal of \u2018Witchfinder General\u2019 is the perfect opener.\n\nAt the time, the bland single \u2018Beyond The Grave\u2019 was a little misleading, as \u2018Lionheart\u2019 is without a doubt my favorite Saxon album of the current century. \u2018Lionheart\u2019 is not even a decent album with a few standout tracks, as many recent albums by bands that have been around a long time seem to be. While many traditional bands who tend to keep it simple embarrass themselves when they attempt quasi-progressive tracks, even \u2018Searching For Atlantis\u2019 is enjoyable enough. If I were to suggest a Saxon album to get familiar with them, I\u2019d still go with \u2018Strong Arm Of The Law\u2019 or \u2018Power & The Glory\u2019, but fans of traditional heavy metal could do a lot worse than \u2018Lionheart\u2019.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Lionheart\u2019, \u2018Justice\u2019, \u2018To Live By The Sword\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nThis year we celebrate the goddamned 40th anniversary of Saxon\u2019s second and third album. Here I want to speak about \u201cStrong Arm of the Law\u201d. If this is no cool name for a metal album, than I doubt that there exist cool titles for metal outputs at all. Moreover, a look at the track list proves evidence that Saxon delivered their part in terms of identity-creating buzzwords. \u201cHeavy Metal Thunder\u201d or \u201cTo Hell and Back Again\u201d shaped the outlaw image of an entire music genre. This was generic and greenhorns might be of the opinion that it sounds primitive, but dudes, we are speaking of 1980 and at that time, songs like \u201cHeavy Metal Thunder\u201d were exactly the stuff the growing scene needed \u2013 in terms of the music and of the lyrics.\n\nThe opener is a pretty aggressive statement with concise riffing and \u201cTo Hell and Back Again\u201d is almost a harbinger of the speed metal revolution. Not as \u201cfast as a shark\u201d, but still an up-tempo rocker with swift guitars. The same goes for \u201c20,000 Feet\u201d, another nice up-tempo headbanger of the first generation. Of course, Saxon mainly delivered traditional stuff (naturally without knowing that we would call it traditional 40 years later). The title track, for example, mirrors the 1980\u2019s status of the heavy metal development pretty well. The basic riff could originate from the Young-factory as well, the melodic elements do not come off badly and the chorus builds the central part of the conventionally structured track. Finally, Biff\u2019s vocals tower above the music. His voice was never the most voluminous one, but he is able to convey the lyrical content authentically. Thus, he gives comparatively simple rockers like \u201cHungry Years\u201d something special. Nevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to say that all pieces are real jewels. \u201cSixth Form Girls\u201d nearly marks a real flop. On the other hand, the album followed hot on the heels of \u201cWheels of Steel\u201d. So when taking in consideration that only four months lie between these two full-lengths, nobody can blame early Saxon for creative undercapacity.\n\nListening in 2020 to these tracks leads to the surprising conclusion that they still sound fresh and nearly timeless. Maybe the almost eroticising fact is important that one is confronted with one of the first steps of metal and I cannot exclude that the originality of this classic compositions is influencing (or even manipulating) my perception. Anyway, the album does definitely not suffer from an ill-defined production. The intention to create a really heavy album is still tangible. \n\nFinally, the album dealt with one of the most discussed crimes of human history. \u201dDallas 1 PM\u201d did not only glitter with its stoic yet somehow threatening guitars. Its lyrics about the murder of JFK made clear that heavy metal does not shy away from topics which have been (and still are) rather unpopular in radio-friendly music. And even more than 56 years after the shots from Dallas, it is still an open question who killed the President. Just one thing seems to be sure, it was not Lee Harvey Oswald. Why should he have wait until the limousine had passed the building where they found \u201chis\u201d ridiculous shotgun? He just paid the price for somebody else. But I digress \u2013 and I admit that I cannot maintain that \u201cStrong Arm of the Law\u201d has been discussed as often as the death of Kennedy during the last four decades. But it has stood the test of time in its own way and I am sure a lot of Americans would have been happy if a strong arm of the law would have protected the President on Elm Street. Maybe we know more about this crime when it comes to the 50th anniversary of Saxon's third work, but I don't think so.\n",
        "\nThere has been a strong consensus that somewhere around the time that thrash metal became the ascendant answer to the metal question that its NWOBHM forerunners began a rather rapid decline into commercial hard rock mediocrity. In Saxon's particular case, fingers are often pointed at their 1983 slight commercial pivot Power & The Glory as being the point where they lost the metallic plot, though this sentiment becomes all but unanimous with regard to their even more rock-based 1984 follow up Crusader. But objectively speaking, while the sort of prototype speed/thrashing characteristics of their early 80s offerings definitely hold an obvious edge in terms of intensity, the maligned status of both these albums as commercial sellouts seems more a product of their release being in closer proximity to their arena-oriented mid-80s shift via Innocence Is No Excuse than any lack of metallic content. To be clear, this 1984 opus is still a far cry from the Denim And Leather sound, let alone the previous two offerings, but it would still fit in quite nicely with the majority of NWOBHM offerings of the earlier days and is still a bit heavier than those offerings that tended a bit closer to the 70s rock sound that helped birth the movement.\n\nWhile previously exhibiting a strong presentation from start to finish, Saxon has generally put their best foot forward during the opening moments of each album, and this proves to be doubly so in this album's case. The haunting ambient sounds of wind howling, horses neighing and battle cries sounding to the tune of war horns lay the groundwork for what is one of this band's more iconic metal anthems and title song \"Crusader\", emerging from a droning, folksy clean guitar intro that may well have inspired the signature epic intros often employed by Running Wild to a crushing, militaristic march reminiscent of Black Sabbath's \"Heaven And Hell\" with about double the heaviness factor. Everything about this song is on point from the sense of tension and buildup between the verse and chorus sections and Biff Byford's raunchy yet tuneful vocal delivery, perfectly embodying that sort of heroic heavy metal visual that would continue to be a staple of the style in subsequent decades. Truth be told, this song's greatest flaw is that it is so iconic that is steals much of the remainder of this album's thunder in a manner fair'y similar to how the massive title song of Rush's 2112 did to an otherwise respectable collection of songs that followed.\n\nThat being said, most of what occupies this album is a respectable exercise in rocking heavy metal that is fun, catchy, and still possessed of that needed edge to get the heads banging. More swift-paced anthems that admittedly lean a bit heavy on the rock cliches such as \"A Little Bit Of What You Fancy\" and \"Set Me Free\" have plenty of bite to go along with the excessive degree of bark, with the latter showcasing a highly enthralling lead guitar display to rival Brian Tatler's best work with Diamond Head. Things veer a bit into power ballad territory on the elongated, mid-paced anthem \"Sailing To America\", complete with Biff cleaning up his voice a bit and indulging in some heavy vocal overdub work to get a massive vocal backdrop accomplished that might be construed as quasi-glam rock in demeanor, but even here there is a strong emphasis on the guitar and a solid working class feel to keep it from becoming too much like Dokken. Truth be told, apart from a lyrical emphasis on partying and rock 'n' roll, much of the mainline rocking material like \"Bad Boys (Like To Rock 'N' Roll)\" and \"Rock City\" aren't too far off from the rugged feel of Twisted Sister and Quiet Riot, save maybe for the heavy employment of arena-oriented gang chorus segments.\n\nOpinions may vary as to whether Saxon's lighter late 80s sound was solid or poor, but it's a pretty massive stretch to lump this album in completely with what followed it. True, that early days rawness that had a degree of influence on Metallica is almost completely absent from this album's presentation, but it's no less a metal album than, say, Diamond Head's Lightning To The Nations or Tokyo Blade's debut from the previous year. It could be said that a lot of hopes were dashed over this album not sticking with the epic feel of the opening for at least a few more songs and much of this having a bit more of a party hearty sound rather than a soundtrack to Christendom retaking the holy land in a conceptual package, but this seems more a product of historical revisionism regarding the NWOBHM rather than a true assessment of what it was, namely a gradual evolution of metal out of the confines of its hard rock roots. Saxon seemed a bit more prone to return to their rock roots rather than shed them as the 80s unfolded, but it's definitely a mistake to lump this in with the material that would follow, or to treat it as anything other than a solid collection of fist-raising anthems that, while not as impact-based as their seminal material, are definitely worth of the Saxon legacy.\n",
        "\nSaxon is a band that needs little introduction. They are a highly influential band that was part of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWoBHM) movement. They have a trilogy of classic albums that cemented their legacy. I'll be reviewing the first of said trilogy, Wheels of Steel. A huge step up from their self-titled debut, this sophomore album from Saxon is undeniably a classic.\n\nAnd a classic album with iconic tunes no less. Opening track \"Motorcycle Man\" lives up to its title, as the punk rock influences literally make it sound like if its made for bikers. \"747 (Strangers in the Night)\" stands out for having some killer psychedelic guitar tones to it, possibly being influenced by albums like The Doors' self-titled debut. Wheels of Steel's title track has some rather groovy guitar leads which makes it a perfect example of a song that influenced thrash metal. Just go compare the song to Metallica's \"Seek & Destroy\" and you'll understand my reasoning.\n\nBeing a NWoBHM band and having influenced thrash, Saxon is influenced by punk rock. This is perfectly displayed by Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver's guitar play on Wheels of Steel, which blends the punk influence with traditional metal. The solos are quick and the riffs are a strong demonstration of Saxon's genre as seen on tracks like \"Machine Gun\". Pete Gill's drumming is generally in the mid tempo range, but on songs like \"Freeway Mad\", he'll play at a more fast paced tempo reminiscent of Black Flag. Biff Byford's vocals on Wheels of Steel are different compared to say, Denim and Leather as his vocals are essentially a cross between a Paul Di'Anno rasp and Bruce Dickinson's soaring vocals. A good example of this comparison is on \"Street Fighting Gang\" which is also notable for having Oliver Dawson's best bass performance on Wheels of Steel.\n\nAlthough I'd find a street fighting gang to be dangerous and scary, Wheels of Steel has all of the punches and kicks for a NWoBHM album. Along with Mot\u00f6rhead's Ace of Spades it pretty much served as the basis for a pseudo genre known as \"biker metal\". But unlike Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon embraced metal as their genre and ended up becoming one of the biggest bands of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. As the band's breakthrough hit, Wheels of Steel is essential for any metalhead and it does not need a reason for this perfect score. This was a masterpiece since it was released almost forty years ago.\n",
        "\nWhen a classic metal band are nearing the cusp of their seventies in age, new material from them can either be surprisingly amazing or a total downfall. Saxon\u2019s newest effort Thunderbolt fits the first description, as this is one of the best albums they\u2019ve dropped since the turn of the new millennium. Biff Byford and co. do not hold back for a single second, despite their old age. Musically, it\u2019s quite comparable to Judas Priest\u2019s newest effort Firepower, but honestly, I think I like this one better by just a hair.\n\nThose who seek a throwback record to the classic era of Saxon are going to be mildly disappointed. Yes, there are still traces of that here, but the sound itself it totally different, and there are actually quite a lot of drops from the power metal flask. Tracks like \u201cNosferatu\u201d are very epic and include some operatic features, and the lyrical themes of fantastical beings certainly add to this. Speaking of which, there\u2019s a lot of Norse mythology touched on as well, which gives way to Amon Amarth\u2019s very own Johan Hegg doing guest vocals in \u201cPredator.\u201d The combination of his harsh vocals mixed with Biff\u2019s cleans are a beautiful combo.\n\nThe more typical Saxonisms make their way in on some of the faster tracks. Songs like \u201cThey Played Rock N Roll\u201d stick to themes that the band always hit in the past, and the guitars in this fire through faster than a train on a straight track. Clean production makes every note and every drum kick come through very clearly, so you pick up on everything and nothing goes missed. This is where the comparison to Judas Priest\u2019s newer works come in, as their tracks are constructed and produced in a very similar manner. Likewise, the riffs are absolutely crushing, and there are so many of them! Vocally, I\u2019d compare it more to the modern Deep Purple albums, as its basically Ian Gillan made more powerful.\n\nIf you think this is all too much to swallow, it still doesn\u2019t end there. Harsher tamperings inspired by modern forms of metal seep into the cracks with tracks like \u201cSniper.\u201d This one slows down the pace and darkens the guitar chugs to a very unsettling degree. This may be hard to believe, but there may even be something that comes close to a breakdown in this song, but I\u2019ll let you be the judge of that.\n\nReally, there\u2019s more weight to Thunderbolt than there has been to any recent Saxon record. These classic metal gods really know how to keep on delivering, and anyone who is a fan that let this slip under the radar must give this disc a spin. There\u2019s power metal, speed metal, clean production, death growl features and borderline breakdown sections all packed into an overall classic metal bottle. This record is out in multiple formats and can likely be found in your local record stores and most online vendors. Thunderbolt came out on February 2nd, 2018 on Silver Lining Music. Give this a spin, and take a trip to Valhalla!\n\nOriginally written for Indy Metal Vault:\nhttps://www.indymetalvault.com/2018/11/08/album-review-saxon-thunderbolt/\n",
        "\nI've never gotten into Saxon, and I'm not really familiar with their older stuff. I've heard it, but not really, so this review won't compare this album to their others, It'll just be a review of this album.\n\nI started listening to Thunderbolt because Saxon opened up for Judas Priest on their Firepower tour and I thought they sounded pretty bitchin', so I started listening to them online and bought this album. Obviously I like it or I wouldn't have bought it. Unless it was a gift for someone else, which it wasn't. \n\nThe heavy metal on this album is sort of similar to contemporary Judas Priest and Accept. It doesn't sound the same; it is unique, but fits squarely within that awesome, driving, pummeling, head rolling down the street and exploding type of traditional style. Judas Priest and Accept seem to be getting better, and I expect that is the same with Saxon.\n\nThe highlight of this album is \"The Secret of Flight\", a very epic sounding account of the human desire to fly, and how we have accomplished this dream. The multi-layered vocals over the galloping guitars gives the effect of flying above the stampede below. The riffage is awesome, and the vocals are unique. This song stands out along with Manilla Road's \"Tomes of Clay\" and Blaze Bayley's \"18 Days\" as recent metal gems. The rest of the album is solid, but this song, in particular, is a perfect 10.\n\nThe heaviest song on the album is \"Sniper\" and it reminded me instantly of Paul Dianno's vocals on songs like \"War Machine\" and \"Madman in the Mirror\" from his \"Living Dead\" album.\n\nThanks to their live performance, Thunderbolt, and especially \"The Secret of Flight\", Saxon has sparked my interest, and I'll be checking out their previous releases.\n",
        "\nSaxon has a tendency to put out their best work in one of two circumstances; when they stop dicking around and focus all of their effort on no-nonsense blue-collar ass-whoopin' (i.e Wheels of Steel and Call to Arms), or when they do nothing but dick around and deliver an iridescent menagerie of metal subgenres with no filler in between (i.e Lionheart, which gleaned over everything from moody Danzig-esque metal to berserk speed/thrash madness). Saxon took the road less traveled, opting to form the foundation of Thunderbolt using the smorgasbord strategy. The result? An operose boxing match of variable tempo, aggression, and articulation.\n\nI'd be remiss not to immediately mention 'Predator', a track notable for frontman Biff Byford sharing the mic with the chasmal growls of Amon Amarth's Johan Hegg. Reminiscent of Annihilator's early 00's material, the song structure of 'Predator' is grippingly dark, defined by hulking, bloodthirsty riffs and a bizarrely effective approach to harmonizing vocals. 'Speed Merchants' is written in the same vein, albeit much faster. The sleazy, up-to-no-good speed riffs put me in the mind of my favorite Canadian psychopaths Razor... for reasons that go beyond them also having a song called 'Speed Merchants'. In vocal delivery and in riffing patterns, this track manages to recite scripture from the best moments of Sacrifice and their 1999 slugfest Metalhead.\n\nLike Lionheart (and unlike the comparatively narcoleptic Battering Ram) this album still has plenty of power even when things slow down for the epics. We're treated to melodic headbangers like 'A Wizard's Tale', which sings from the same hymn sheet as Killing Ground's 'Dragons Lair', and the most overt testament to the album's ambitious variety, 'Nosferatu (The Vampire's Waltz)'. Boasting a waltz time signature, cannily enough, 'Nosferatu' is a haunting power metal ballad featuring Biff's consistently astounding vocal range, and Quinn and Scarrat's rejuvenated ability to write memorable leads in an appropriate context.\n\nAfter Thunderbolt strikes with brilliant flashes of electricity, there are naturally times when it must let out a prolonged, rumbling fart of thunder. I'll come right out and say it; 'They Played Rock and Roll' might be the dullest, most synthetic tribute to the fallen members of Mot\u00f6rhead I've ever heard. Its name carries the reasonable expectation that it would be, I don't know, played like rock 'n' roll? Instead all you're given is a vapid guitar lesson and subdued vocals that merely namedrop the most obvious songs and albums from the band's catalog. Other, more marginal complaints concern Saxon's insidious habit of shoehorning in completely unnecessary intro tracks and 'raw' versions of songs. I'm not one to look a gifthorse in the mouth, but it tends to spoil the flow of an album. Besides, the orchestral/church organ element was implemented well in 'Nosferatu'; what was the point of taking it out?\n\nFor my money, the best Saxon album will always be the mighty Lionheart, so naturally I would enjoy the like-minded gradience of styles displayed in Thunderbolt. Bold and incursive, and miles ahead of Battering Ram in terms of consistency and keeping me awake, Saxon's twenty-second album is a snappy rebound that I could recommend to the Saxon faithful and faithless alike.\n",
        "\nIt was you, that set the spirit free\n\nHeavy Metal Thunder is nothing more than a compilation of tunes by bands that were breaking the surface back in the days of 1983. I discovered this in a recommended tab somewhere somehow, and ended up finding it on eBay for a measly four bucks (plus shipping). Seems promising, so why not?\n\nBefore this was discovered, I'd never listened to Brian Connoly or Heartbreak, and those two make up the poppier tracks on this release, but don't let that turn you away. This adds a flavor of '80s synth and cheesiness that could not be more fitting for a group of metal bands that are on the less aggressive side of the spectrum, adding some fun into the variety. Rage is definitely on the harder side, however not very abrasive, making for another fun discovery. Plus, let's not skip the fact that they can lay down some sick guitar licks, which is very present here.\n\nOf course, there's three Saxon songs, as the title is taken from one of their songs. All three are classic tunes with a pumping overlay to them, yet a toned down sense of accessibility that is perfectly fitting for a Saturday morning ease into the weekend. Besides, can anyone really not dig \"Denim And Leather\"? Dokken make two appearances here from their earliest works, when their music was easily compared to the likes of Saxon or Accept. Not too many signs of the glam sound they would later adapt, but seeing that both styles are killer, this is quite a treat. Anyone familiar with Demon knows that they too fall on the the border of harder rock and heavy metal. Both of their tracks have a party-like vibe to them, driven by hard guitar riffing, but not so crushing delivery, which, again, is perfect for this.\n\nSo what we can really say is that this is a pretty friendly compilation of metal tunes and poppy rock songs from the early era of this style. No signs of anger or extreme heaviness is present, so it's more fitting for a tamer setting, or fans who dig metal without it needing to be fierce. I wouldn't say this is an essential purchase or anything, but if encountered for cheap, it's a neat little piece to own. As far as I'm concerned, it's only available in vinyl form. Happy shopping!\n",
        "\nSince the mid 80's, Saxon was struggling with poor record sales and concerts attendance, after the release of albums of questionable musical quality. The changes of sound and visual made the band more \u201cglam\u201d then their fans could take, and the band was finally dropped from EMI in 1988. After that, the band started gradually to change their sound back to traditional heavy metal, and delivered good releases with Solid Ball of Rock, Forever Free and Dogs of War.\n\nWhen 1997 came, the band had already kicked-out long time guitarist Graham Oliver for trying to sell material from the band's 1980 performance at Monsters of Rock without the groups consent, and Doug Scarratt was brought in to fill the gap in 1995. Unleash The Beast is his first album with the band, and led to a 23-year union that lasts to this day.\n\nStarting with an instrumental piece called Gothic Dreams, the album has 53 minutes of the best Saxon can offer their fans: it has great lyrical work, and the guitars sound heavy, modern and very melodic. The record even has an acoustic song, Absent Friends, something that is not very common on Saxon's records. Unleash The Beast sounds slower than classical Saxon sound, but that's the whole point of the album: it distances itself from what the band was doing in the 80's and gives new life into the group. The album brought the band to the metal spot light once again.\n\nThe lyrics have a great diversity of topics: the content includes the traditional speed/riding thematic that follow the band's career, with a mix of mysticism and fantasy themes, near-death experience, politics, religion, war, and other topics. It shows the band has learned from their various changes within the years, finally combining a broad variety of subjects with a new and solid heavy metal sound, even when they sound simple in songs like Unleash The Beast and The Preacher (\"Fire and brimstone send you straight to hell\",\"gather round beneath the mission bell\", \"holy fire, holy water\"). \n\nSaxon's Unleash The Beast also has a quality that most modern metal albums lack: there are no fillers. You can actually listen to the whole album without saying \u201cthis song is here just to add time on the record\u201d. Unleash The Beast is Saxon's best effort from the 90's and it deserves the credit of bringing back to the game a great band that was starting to get behind the shadows. And they got out of the dark like a raging beast, just like the one on the cover.\n",
        "\nEven though the band released a more robust and consistent work six months later, their sophomore effort became the most praised piece within the NWOBHM and an emblematic album for said subgenre. While the fact of featuring radio-friendly stuff could have been coined as the most relevant driver of its success, it is also important to point out the use gave to the biker-related lyrics, which fit the standards of a decade on which being a biker was highly honored, if not a dream. \n\nIn terms of musicianship, the band tends to move over and over from the border between hard rock and heavy metal, resulting in a set of songs that could be as romantic and sentimental as \"Suzie Hold On\" or as epic as \"747 (Strangers in the Night)\". Such a variety is a point in favor of the album when all is said and done; however, when the band tuned things down, they took certain wrong decisions, as mid-paced numbers like the title song and \"Suzie Hold On\". Even when both songs are still worthy-listening, they are not able to reach the dynamism that characterizes their trademark sound, making the album a little bit inconsistent. An exception to this issue, is \"747 (Strangers in the Night)\". That song fucking owns everything in the road, especially the solo played during the intro.\n\nHowever, when these guys combine speed metal with their lyrics dealing with their stories about owning the highway, they do it astonishingly, giving life to moments in which men and machines lived together to conquer the roads. Is there someone rocking more than that? No, definitely no. These guys are the masters of chains and leather, and did not hesitate at making the Earth shake from the very beginning with the frantic speed metal number \"Motorcycle Man\". Its interesting riffs and tremendously accelerated drumming are in line with the musical standards established by Mot\u00f6rhead. In few words, it's pure Mot\u00f6rhead worship. Running wild through a similar path, \"Freeway Mad\" and \"Street Fighting Gang\" also represent the spirit of the highway that [insert the name of the wildest power trio in the British metal scene] exploited during the previous decade, especially during their earliest years. But if you think insanity stopped here, give yourself some minutes to listen to the craziest track on the album: \"Machine Gun\". Such hyperactive closing number begins with an intro riff that indeed tries to imitate the speed (if not the sound) of a machine gun. Thereafter, the band plays like Deep Purple on amphetamines, or even worse than that.\n\nNo matter how great is the next album. The band provided an incredible performance that reaches the levels of speed, savageness, and intensity that best characterize the NWOBHM, mainly, when their front-man is no other than Biff Byford, and their guitarists demonstrated to remain as one with their instrument. Once again, no matter how good is the next album, whether you choose this one or the other, your experience would be somewhat satisfactory.\n",
        "\nSaxon has been playing heavy metal by the numbers for four decades but for some unfathomable reason, the British quintet is still around and quite popular. I've decided to give the band's new record a few spins since Saxon is going on tour with the much more energizing, talented and variable Judas Priest. It turns out Thunderbolt is neither among Saxon's best cuts from the late seventies and early eighties nor among the group's worst records from the late eighties. The band's twenty-third studio record doesn't offer anything new to the genre but is performed with passion and convinces with a crunchy production.\n\nAmong the few highlights, I would probably mention the epic and very melodic ''The Secret of Flight'' which would have deserved some radio airplay if it had been released in the band's early career. The majestic and slow ''Sons of Odin'' sounds like Black Sabbath gone Manowar with powerful bass lines, simple but efficient riffs and emotional vocals and could actually work very well in concert. ''Sniper'' is probably this record's heaviest track as it recalls Judas Priest's signature style and invites to bang your hand and raise your fists.\n\nListening to Thunderbolt is entertaining once because Saxon performs with passion and is inspired by the numerous heavy metal bands that have managed to stand out and revolutionize the genre while Saxon have mostly played it safe. As soon as you give this release a second spin though, the songs become dull and predictable as they are too closely inspired by other heavy metal legends and prove that Saxon have never quite found their own style after all these years. That isn't necessarily an entirely bad thing because Thunderbolt could please to numerous traditional heavy metal fans and would be an appropriate introduction to the genre for younger audiences because you get some Accept, Judas Priest and Manowar influences all at once to only name a few examples and inspirations. \n\nIn the end, Thunderbolt is an average heavy metal record that is enjoyable to listen to once and whose songs should work well in concert. Still, Saxon still doesn't have enough to offer to stand out among its peers which is quite saddening after four decades. I respect the band's genuine passion for the genre and that they have been around for such a long time but artistically speaking Thunderbolt just isn't impressive at all. What the band offers here isn't enough to justify a purchase of this record and even similar traditional heavy metal bands like Anvil have recently been releasing more interesting records while younger genre bands like White Wizzard have already outclassed Saxon a long time ago.\n",
        "\nHeavy metal these days is in constant flux, trying to reinvent itself, oftentimes by going back to the roots and digging up and reusing what made traditional metal so great thirty years ago. In swoop the mighty Saxon to prove that the some of the founding fathers are still going strong and remain the bosses of this monster mamma jam. Few bands have survived as long as they, and fewer still have done so while retaining all the vigor of the eighties heydays while seemingly growing stronger, mightier and immensely more powerful with age. \n\nThunderbolt is their 22nd album and it comes some two and a half years after the previous one, Battering Ram (2015). As always, the music is built on a simplistic foundation and catchy riffs care of Paul Quinn and Doug Scarratt. Trading lead guitar duties and solo dueling the guys show no sign of slowing down, while also throwing around some venomous leads to accompany the background rhythms of bassist \u2018Nibbs\u2019 Carter and drummer Nigel Glockler.\n\nThunderbolt includes the song 'They Played Rock And Roll', a tribute to companions Mot\u00f6rhead and even more fitting with the recent passing of \u2018Fast\u2019 Eddie Clarke. The tune hails immediately back to the old days and blends the modern Saxon sound with a distinct Mot\u00f6rhead vibe. The album doesn\u2019t quite stop at there though; Johan Hegg (Amon Amarth) delivers a set of ballsy guest vocals in 'Predator', delivering tenacity and aggression with his eloquent growls to combat Biff Byford\u2019s raspy, reliable cleans. \n\nThat dark, ominous, sometimes almost symphonic, melodic backdrop that was so present on some of the previous works has been scaled back and used mostly to great effect on a couple of the tracks - most notably 'Nosferatu (The Vampire\u2019s Waltz)', likely the strongest track on here. Musically it\u2019s just as proficient as one would expect, but that massive feel that Battering Ram did so great seems lacking in some parts. Not that that scaled back approach is necessarily a bad thing, it works great in heavy tracks like 'The Secret Of Flight' and 'They Played Rock And Roll'.\n\nAfter around 'Sniper' the album takes a slight dip, especially on the two closing tracks, 'Speed Merchants' and 'Roadies\u2019 Song'. While they feel distinctly Saxon and toss around some nifty guitar work, they are also the least inspired tracks on here. That\u2019s not enough to quench the insatiable thirst Saxon seems to have for delivering album after album of incredibly strong heavy metal, that is just that; pure heavy metal.\n\nThey toss in some of the darker, slightly symphonic elements in tracks like 'Nosferatu (The Vampire\u2019s Waltz)' while rocking it old school in 'They Played Rock And Roll' and 'Sniper', always with great performances by the band. Not least mainman Biff Byford himself, whose unique voice remains as Biff as Biff ever was. \n\nThunderbolt is a collection of songs that sound as potent and vigorous as ever. Right from the get-go with the melodic, punch packing title track there is a strong, vibrant and yet laid back and comfortable feel. While the album doesn\u2019t quite reach the heights of Battering Ram and isn\u2019t very boundary pushing, leave it to Saxon to do what they\u2019ve always done and nail it straight out of the gate.\n\nStandout tracks: Thunderbolt, Nosferatu (The Vampire\u2019s Waltz), Predator\n",
        "\nPerhaps it is not the most original action to record a tribute to Mot\u00f6rhead after the death of Philty, Lemmy and, most recently, Fast Eddie. Perhaps Saxon have never been the most original band. Perhaps \"They Played Rock and Roll\" is just another, not very original number with a conventional pattern. But one thing is for sure, and I say it with all due respect to everybody who does not share this point of view: this song is an absolute giant. I bet: 99% of the people who do not love this piece do not love heavy metal in general. An irresistible riff drives the song forward and the further components hit the nail on the head as well. A comparatively fast rhythm (it's the only number here which borders on speed metal), generic yet fantastic lyrics and the familiar voice of Biff shape a real earworm and a new classic. This is their next monument after the overwhelming title track of \"Battering Ram\". No doubt, Saxon are more than \"Denim and Leather\" or \"Strong Arm of the Law\" and they still have something to say. In my humble opinion, this separates them from Judas Priest.\n\nOkay, the new title track is significantly weaker than that of the predecessor, but the transition line \"Unleash the Gods of War\" stands out and the very typical pattern of the number represents the album in a pretty proper way. By the way, its lyrics refers to the Greek mythology. Cerberus and Zeus appear, Icarus is mentioned in another track. Even Nosferatu stops by for a cup of tea in order to start bilateral discussions between Greece and Romania. But I digress. Let's get back to the title track, it marks a solid start but it does not blow me away.\n\nSongs such as \"The Secret of Flight\" are more punchy. It goes the way that tracks like \"Circle of Light\" have already taken. A lively riff introduces the song, comparatively strict riffs follow and both the melodic chorus and the atmospheric solo contribute to a strong overall impression. Its mid-paced tempo dominates the entire output and that's positive, because \"Sons of Odin\", a slow moving, slightly majestic piece reveals little signs of weariness and it distantly reminds me of Running Wild's extremely generic and a little bit amateurish \"Evil Spirit\". In view of this association, I prefer more biting tracks like \"Predator\" or \"Sniper\". Do they offer something new or at least unexpected? No, but they show a band in its element. Only the growls in the background of \"Predator\" do not make any sense. I don't want to hear the average voice of a death metal vocalist - I want to be entertained by Biff. After Lemmy's death, he is the last credible elder statesman of heavy metal and he does not need help to interpret Saxon's music successfully. His voice creates vibes that combine nonchalance and rebellion, dignity and aggression in a unique manner.\n\nLet's speak about the production. Well, does anybody expect a sound chaos? Or thin guitars? Miserably deflagrating drums? Or any other major defects? Of course not. Andy Sneap knows what he is doing. \"Battering Ram\" was minimally rougher, but \"Thunderbolt\" has the usual Saxon sound, a mix of power, transparency, compactness and well-dosed harshness. No matter from what perspective it is looked at, the album meets the expectations, no more, no less. It has a few weak moments, for example the lacklustre bridge and chorus of \"Roadie's Song\", and I have no idea why they offer \"Nosferatu\" twice, but from a bird's-eye view, nothing hurts the harmonic picture. Philthy, Lemmy and Fast Eddie (R.I.P.) would like it. Wait a moment, I think I hear a dirty, boozy and well-known voice from out of the sky... \"they are Saxon... and they play rock and roll\". Cheers to all who like this sound wherever they dwell - in heaven, on earth and in hell.\n",
        "\nBarring the heinous sperm bank robberies Saxon committed throughout the mid-to-late 80's, their paradigm has eternally been an electric merry-go-round of blues, rock 'n' roll, and bombastic power metal. Set into motion by the supremely underrated 1997 maverick Unleash the Beast - notable for its fantasy lyrics, vivid solos, and unabashed Dio worship - Saxon has rolled with this formula and justifiably milked it for all its worth. For Battering Ram, Biff was clenching that familiar udder pretty hard, but the metal bucket just wasn't filling.\n\nFor their twenty first studio album, Saxon throws more than a few narcoleptic softballs like 'Queen of Hearts' and the ironically titled 'Hard and Fast'. I'm no stranger to mid-tempo rockers, and I even found Saxon's reminiscence of commercial power ballads in 'To the End' an inviting change of pace. But some changes of pace, like the mostly-spoken 'Kingdom of the Cross' epic, or the country-rock hootenanny 'Three Sheets to the Wind', didn't go over well with me, or the majority of Saxon purists, I'd wager. The former sounds like an outtake from Metalhead, whereas the latter would sound pretty cheesy even among the unapologetic country cornjobs polluting the otherwise-solid Dogs of War. Not to mention there's a disappointing amount of self-quotation and over-simplification of riffs and overall song structure. Battering Ram is hurting for its own identity, and the mono-riffed 'Destroyer' and its utterly piss-taking lyricism is prima facie evidence.\n\nAnd now that I'm done choking this album like it owes me money, I'm willing to dust off its shoulders and give it a little praise. As the high-contrast comic-like album cover might portend, there's an over-the-top blustering throughout certain songs that works in their favor. 'Top of the World' is an excellent 'Leather Rebel'-style horn-raiser where everyone puts on an ardent performance, especially the operatic wailing of frontman Biff Byford. I also got a kick out of 'Stand Your Ground', which manages to out-Accept the bulk of The Rise of Chaos with its intemperate riffing and extravagant excesses. To speak frankly, Battering Ram manages to excel solely because its not afraid to be a little silly. The emergency weather report in the middle of 'Eye of the Storm' is dangerously cheesy, but Saxon is so earnest and unrepentant about it, they manage to make it work.\n\nDespite some well-delivered uppercuts, and despite the title track demanding I come worship at its metal church, Battering Ram is not my favorite modern Saxon album. Far from it, in fact, as I see little reason to spin it over the vastly superior Sacrifice released just a few years earlier. Its songwriting is less varied and creative, Sneap's production seems uncharacteristically scrawny, and even the simple concept of brevity eludes this album. Nearly every track repeats itself too often and drags on for longer than necessary; disappointing after the tightly knit Call to Arms and Sacrifice. Still not a complete disaster by any metric, though nor is it the most destructive demon skull log either.\n",
        "\nAfter the rip-roaring success of Call to Arms, I sensed a holding pattern in the works. I predicted the next album would be even burlier 80's recidivism, replete with a grayscale album cover of Cecil Rhodes and his massive butt-chin that can be seen from orbit. But Saxon, a band so routinely lambasted for recording the same album over and over, had other plans. Famously described as \"Less tricks, more power\" by Biff Byford, Sacrifice turned out to be one of Saxon's most aggressive, thuggish albums. Just like Mot\u00f6rhead's Sacrifice.\n\nWith a bold, incursive impetus and an effervescent production I'll discuss at greater length soon, Sacrifice is a dramatic reversal from the fun-loving retro romp that was Call to Arms. Frankly, it's a reversal from just about everything up to this point. Apart from the errant Metalhead vibe I get from the beefy, downtuned riffs that gurgle throughout 'Wheels of Terror' and 'Made in Belfast', Saxon's twentieth album is still managing to explore new pastures. I don't know what's in that Yorkshire tea they're drinking, but maybe they ought to share some with every other NWOBHM band putting out a dreary comeback album just lately.\n\nIn spite of the less tricks, more power approach, the songwriting of Sacrifice possesses a charming amount of depth and variety. I know I praised Call to Arms for its convergent, focused approach to songwriting, but deep-down I was missing the time when Saxon hammed it up and wrote songs about gargoyles coming to life. Here we see a very multi-cultural Saxon explore Asiatic and Mesoamerican themes in 'Guardians of the Tomb' and the title track, respectively. What begins as a contemplative plucking of a Chinese zither, that I immediately compare to Chun-Li's theme from Street Fighter II because I'm so culturally sophisticated, quickly ramps up into a memorable series of crushing chords and a resonant chorus emphasizing the eeriness of the Terracotta Army.\n\nAdding to the stable of memorable tracks is 'Warriors of the Road' and the so-Accept-it-hurts 'Stand Up and Fight'. The latter is often panned and accused of being filler, but I find myself routinely going back to its earworm melody and the wonderfully accented guitar passages. It's worth noting that it's the most Call to Arms this album ever gets; notice how even its track title is an overt callback to the Saxon classic 'Stand Up (And be Counted)'. 'Warriors of the Road' is in the same vein; an appropriately breakneck ode to formula one racing with Exciter-esque riffs and a vocal delivery more versatile than previous outings like 'Afterburner'. And believe it or not, this album also possess the odd subtlety or two. 'Made In Belfast' features a bridge where Quinn's guitar and Glocker's snares sync up with the sound of shipbuilders pounding rivets into a ship's hull. It's the little things, you know?\n\nYou've been waiting very patiently for my production comment, so here goes. For the first time since 1997, this album is not produced by Charlie Bauerfiend, but rather Andy Sneap. And let's get this out in the open, I think Sneap is a talented producer capable of finding and reviving every angstrom of subtlety in the mix. Just feast your ears on that smooth, buttery bass vibrating through the bluesy 'Standing in a Queue' if you want proof. However, this extremely fastidious approach is bound to be a turn-off for some Saxon purists, as its garden-variety cleanliness is at odds with the band's inherent uncleanliness.\n\nAside from that and the forgettable mega-fluff 'Night of the Wolf', Sacrifice continues Saxon's winning streak without much of a fuss. For those keeping score at home, that's eight consecutive albums I've deemed acceptable, phenomenal, and anything in between. In fact, without that unfortunate definition of insanity that plagued much of their 80's output, Saxon would possess one of the most consistent, densely populated heavy metal discographies outside of Mot\u00f6rhead.\n",
        "\nAfter Biff Byford's (successful) 2010 campaign to get heavy metal recognized as a religion in the UK Census, Saxon had some new scripture to write. Their Old Testament was rich with quotable gospels like Denim 5:24 ~ Thou shalt be unified, yea, and thy spirit set free by thy fashion sense, and Girls 4:19 ~ Thy women in tutelage shall abscond from her lessons to lay with factory workers. All well and good, things were coming along nicely, but what about that New Testament? People needed to be convinced that Saxon was still their caring shepherd for the new era of metal. Take it away, Call to Arms.\n\nIf you couldn't tell from the beat-up, sepia-toned album cover with an off-the-rack vinyl silhouette, this is a callback to arms, recounting the particulars of their early 80's songwriting more overtly than any Saxon album to date. Although the authenticity is immediately kneecapped by the squeaky clean production, nearly everything else checks out. Just look at those track times, for starters. You'd struggle to find that kind of unpretentious brevity outside of a Mot\u00f6rhead album. Not only does song structure immediately get to where it's going, but the whole bevy of Quinn and Scarratt's brawny, triumphant riffs have one clear, dedicated focus throughout this entire album.\n\nThis is typified by 'Ballad of the Working Man' - a little bit on the nose, perhaps - but populated by feelgood leads, endlessly charming in their nostalgia and simplicity. In many ways it reminds me of Riot V's recent work, which ever since Army of One has been a reproduction of the glorious Thundersteel. The gallant air of late 80's \"victory\" is so well-delivered, endowed with spontaneous and instinctive lyricism as well as gutsy fretwork. Unlike the past two Saxon albums, these tracks will keep echoing in your head a long time after you've listened to them, and you'll learn the lyrics faster than Biff Byford himself.\n\nSpeaking of Cardinal Byford, his vocal performance is a bit less adventurous in Call to Arms, but it's still capable of delivering everything it needs to. The pair of power ballads 'Mists of Avalon' and 'When Doomsday Comes' demonstrates his unblemished range, with a flourishing lower register and a smattering of high notes without the need for falsetto. If you prefer when Biff loses his mind and sings like the microphone is rigged to explode if his voice ever drops below sixty decibels, I could direct you to this album's designated speed demon 'Afterburner'. A crowd favorite for a laser-precise performance from all members, Biff's vocal chords don't sound like they've aged a day since Killing Ground, which was an entire decade ago.\n\nThe crowning achievement of this album, both symbolically and actually, is 'Surviving Against the Odds'. To be frank, Saxon has had some terrible odds. I would count most metal bands out when they start collaborating with Elton John, but apparently that was some sort of elaborate rope-a-dope tactic. This track has everything I loved about Lionheart: a razor sharp riff that could slice through solid rock, an extrusive solo that will put hairs on your chest hairs, and it's all topped off with a beefy chorus that demands audience accompaniment. And speaking of which, several lucky-ass Saxon fans in the Brighton area did accompany Saxon in 'Back in '79', professionally recorded as part of the song's call-and-response chorus.\n\nBiff said he aimed for a \"return to roots, working-class sound\" for Call to Arms, and you'd have to hail from a different planet not to notice. Every solitary thing about this album - barring the prim production - is a raffish throwback to Saxon's genesis. If it wasn't for the plodding Deep Purple wannabe 'Chasing the Bullet' and the exceptionally unnecessary orchestral version of the title track, I would be happy listening to this album from start to finish, every single time. Call to Arms is emphatically recommended, and easily in my top five Saxon albums of all time.\n",
        "\nI admit I felt a bit of malaise for 2007's The Inner Sanctum. Despite adequately selling me all of the conventional Saxonisms I paid for, I found myself wanting a bit more. More hooks. More solos. More cohesion. More moments that made me feel like Vince McMahon in progressively incredulous states of enthusiasm until physically unable to contain the euphoria. I felt a bit disappointed, in other words. Into the Labyrinth may have flaws of its own, but at least it doesn't come across sounding like a complete lampoon of itself.\n\nLet's mix things up and start with those flaws. You're not exactly in danger of getting lost in this particular labyrinth. There are two directions to walk in: throwbacks to Solid Ball of Rock's irreverent blues dynamism, or theatrical power metal that feels like a natural extension of what was explored throughout Killing Ground. Both directions have a giant neon \"EXIT\" sign flashing above them, and the minotaur is standing in the middle of the hall with map printouts in case you get lost. I don't think any album in Saxon's entire career has been so completely bilinear; not even the tergiversatory Rock the Nations.\n\nSo we face a dilemna. If you like the ballsy Mot\u00f6rhead-style Saxon, you'll love tracks like the moseying driving anthem 'Slow Lane Blues', and the ten-ton soul riffs of 'Crime of Passion'. If you prefer when Saxon breaks out the quill for the hammy power operas, complete with Lacrimosa choir and more reverb than a Power Trip gig in a storm tunnel? Into the Labyrinth has you covered with 'The Letter / Valley of the Kings', 'Protect Yourselves', and the most garish of all, 'Batallions of Steel'. The trouble is, you're not likely to be a fan of both. It's an awfully antonymic venn diagram of genres. Could you imagine if a Mot\u00f6rhead album suddenly decided to include a power metal anthem where every member is an armored knight storming a castle? Well, there was that Iron Fist video...\n\nSaxon's attempt to write an equitable amount of songs representing both of their forking genres was very ambitious, and remarkably, I don't think the quality of either genre suffers as a result. Songwriting feels a lot more fleshed out and dynamic than in The Inner Sanctum, with 'Batallions of Steel' in particular boasting an inordinately memorable bridge that sets the stage for a very well-written call-and-response solo. This massive inertia is somewhat wasted on the forgettable 'Live to Rock', but the Unleash the Beast-esque 'Demon Sweeney Todd' picks things right back up. I wouldn't say this album's \"on and off\", but it's definitely \"on and just barely on\". \n\nMy personal favorite is a tried and true scorcher by the name of 'Hellcat', with a menacing depth in both its tablature and Biff's rumbling lower registers. Its lyricism is ambiguous, so I choose to believe it's about the Melling Hellcat; the concept car that could supposedly go three-hundred miles per hour. 'Hellcat' is played just as fast, and British machinery is a well-documented turn-on for Saxon, so I'm quite confident my theory is correct.\n\nAlthough this album sees a conflicted Saxon pushing hard in two opposite directions, the end result isn't too far from Killing Ground, and I thus dig it. Don't get me wrong, the pacing, sequencing, and overall atmosphere of this album is complete chaos. It's far from a focused, expertly-paced masterpiece like Lionheart or Unleash the Beast, but it's still a fun grabbag of Saxon doing what they do best. Maybe next time, they'll deliver a more consistent album and demonstrate their mastery over one specific genre... Eh, we're already forty years into their career, what are the chances of that?\n",
        "\nSo. Some sorry assemblage of smutty speed metal was sure to select the short straw as Lionheart's subsequent subject. Less of an album and more of a sacrificial lamb offered to a ravenous fanbase who had just finished gormandizing the 2004 masterpiece down to its last bit of gristle, The Inner Sanctum was predestined to be a quickly-digested disappointment. In the past I've judged some Saxon albums a bit harshly for the unpardonable sin of following (or even preceding) a much better album, so I'll attempt to judge The Inner Sanctum only by its own merits.\n\n...In just a second. The year was 2007, and the fabled \"return to form\" album was becoming less of a rarity with each passing millisecond. One by one, veteran bands were having a shakeup and penning their \"best album in X years\" album. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Saints of Los Angeles, Megadeth's United Abominations, Helloween's Gambling with the Devil, no matter the genre, metal was rising from its ashes like a phoenix from the hood of a ram-air Firebird. Sadly, Saxon was early to the party again, having already commenced their furious return-to-form campaign ten years ago, too early for most people to care or even notice. Thus, by the time The Inner Sanctum waltzed in, there's an understandable air of complacency and a \"been there, done that\" template.\n\nIn a way, The Inner Sanctum is very similar to Judas Priest's Angel of Retribution, both in theory and practice. It appears to be a streamlined illustration of the band's paradigm, with just that tiny bit of emphasis on past-glory recital to keep old fans happy. The trouble is, it comes off too strong and ends up sounding like a complete self-parody. 'Need for Speed' and 'Empire Rising / Atila the Hun' still deserve inclusion in Saxon's ever-expanding roster of ballsout speed metal and historical epics, respectively, but with the caveat that they seem more like a caricature than their own entity.\n\nMost drum rhythms define 'phoned in', which is somewhat justifiable as this is Glocker's first performance on a studio album in over ten years. What isn't understandable is how Quinn and Scarratt often take turns aimlessly whammying between verses, in lieu of any sort of memorable solo. The somnolent 'If I Was You' and fittingly-titled 'Going Nowhere Fast' are the worst examples of this. The oversimplified song structures and blatant instances of filler seem carried over from Metalhead or worse still, Dogs of War. Honestly, listen to 'I've Got to Rock (To Stay Alive)' and tell me that doesn't like an AC/DC tribute band warming up.\n\nDespite my unpleasantries, there are of course high points to be enjoyed here. It's impossible to ignore 'Let Me Feel Your Power', a burly speed metal bruiser that sounds straight out of Mot\u00f6rhead's Inferno. And that's about one of the nicest compliments I can give to modern speed metal. This track is so searingly brilliant, in fact, that it would lend its title to a live album released nine years later. The opening track 'State of Grace' is another keeper; Saxon's trademark style of mystical, proggy NWOBHM is infused with modern power metal and makes for an engaging listen, even while breaking Saxon's unwritten law of no keyboards.\n\nSubjective complaints aside, The Inner Sanctum is stymied by a subaqueous production and a notably brittle-sounding Biff. Not only is he less ambitious in his vocal lines, the timbre of his voice is missing a lot of the fullness possessed in earlier albums. Unfortunately I would recommend just about every 21st century Saxon album over this one, as I found it to be a bit meandering and unambitious for its inflated runtime. That said, you don't have much to lose by giving The Inner Sanctum a chance to prove me wrong.\n",
        "\nSaxon's storied career was beginning to resemble a Sphinxian riddle: What flounders in the 80's, flourishes in the 90's, and delivers their most finely-crafted album in the mid-00's? I'm sure adventurers would be quite annoyed at what a subjective Sphinx I am, but that's because they didn't study up on their Saxon, and probably insist Crusader is an underappreciated classic. Speaking of which, exactly twenty years after Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver first switched off their amps to play sluggardly major-scale chords in the background of Biff's lounge singing, the same band crafted the shimmering masterpiece called Lionheart. The only way I could adequately describe the feelings I have for this creative juggernaut? Iron striking metal. The sound of racing steel. It's all I ever wanna hear. It's music to my ears.\n\nThis is in part due to the superb musicianship, but mostly the immense variety. For a band so often derided for never leaving their comfort zone, Lionheart offers listeners soaring power metal dynamism throughout the title track, moody, Danzig affectations in the gothic 'Beyond the Grave' single, and even some light flirting with progressive metal in 'Man and Machine'. No matter the subgenre, Paul Quinn and Doug Scarratt deliver some of their most memorable riffs of their career, perfectly blending Unleash the Beast's potency with the faithful blues temperance of Wheels of Steel. Nowhere is this more evident than on my personal favorite track 'Searching for Atlantis'. Listen if you dare, because those potent tremolo riffs will be embedded into your memory forever. Even better still? Biff now possesses the vocal range of a VTOL.\n\nI've said it once, I'll say it on my death bed: disparage Biff's glam rock croaking throughout the 80's all you want. In fact, I'll do it for you: It was really bad. But you know what it was, more than anything? Imposturous. Because in 2004, when Biff was well into his fifties, he cemented his ability to belt out mountain-splitting notes with all the range, emotion, and raw power of men half his age. I was going to say \"of Bruce Dickinson\", but I chickened out. The crescendo of 'To Live by the Sword' scintillates with stratospheric head voice, and the gloom and doom of 'Beyond the Grave' booms with baritone that would show up on the Richter scale. Biff's lungs have me convinced the track 'Man and Machine' is autobiographical.\n\nAnd finally, I couldn't help but notice the drumkit is bathed in some sort of cosmic, holy light? Saxon's always enjoyed an enviable roster of talented drummers, but J\u00f6rg Michael was their very first drum god. I care less of his main claim to fame as the drummer for Stratovarius, and more for his mad percussion in the burgeoning Mekong Delta. His cybernetic timekeeping and polyrhythms switch duties from the maniacal thrash band to the comparatively reserved Saxon. And it is glorious. From the steamrolling kicks in 'Witchfinder General', to the pulse-pounding rhythm of 'Justice', even down to the slower bluesy rhythms throughout the massive 'Flying on the Edge', Lionheart is an unrelenting artillery barrage of solid gold drumwork.\n\nI suppose every long-established band is destined to have this kind of triumph. This out-of-the-blue zenith that transcends all expectations and shows the world that consistency isn't the only thing this band is good at. Riot V's Thundersteel, Rage's Soundchaser, Mot\u00f6rhead's Inferno, and I wouldn't be a Saxon fan if I didn't add Lionheart to this pantheon of heavy metal royalty. If this Saxon retrospective convinces you to listen to just one Saxon album, do me a solid and let it be Lionheart.\n",
        "\nI've noticed the recent glut of re-recorded metal albums has been arousing some indignation lately. I can't imagine why, when Iron Savior is releasing Megatropolis 2.0 less than seven years after the original. Heavy Metal Thunder is Saxon's foray into this maligned trend, but I say we cut this one some slack. The year was 2002 and music consumption was a completely different beast. For starters, visiting a record store didn't involve a dream-quest of unknown Kadath. So if you wanted to investigate your favorite band's back catalog, put on your detective trenchcoat and prepare to put in some effort, bucko, because YouTube won't exist for another three years.\n\nYour options were simple: You could make blind purchases (and risk buying Destiny), read magazine reviews and make informed purchases (and risk buying Destiny), see them live (and risk Bruce Dickinson tearing up your \"Play Classics\" sign), or buy a slapdash 'Best of' album with a botched setlist and mastering. Like all of them. Saxon, typically one step ahead of the pack, gave you an early alternative; their greatest hits on one CD, sporting a very glossy new paintjob.\n\nBarring a few glaring absenses that I'll belabor in just a moment, Saxon decided on a sagely \"something for everyone\" approach with a slight bias toward their mature, mid-tempo offerings. Gritty speed metal is still represented and exemplified by 'Motorcycle Man' and the immortal track that named this album, but mostly we're winding down with '747 (Strangers in the Night)', 'Crusader', and the ode to the grassy knoll 'Dallas 1 PM'. And I got a bit of a problem with this one. Truthfully I was never the biggest fan of the original, but the revamp still managed to sour my mood. Nevermind the fact that this historical eulogy couldn't clash harder against the bombastic, youthful disposition of the album, but Saxon completely omits the emergency broadcasts in the acoustic bridge. Why?\n\nAlso absent is the crowd's jubilation in 'And the Bands Played On', which is equally unacceptable. Such a primal sound promulgates the entire mood of that song; it exudes this awesome aura of sitting outside at a festival listening to your favorite bands rock out. Without it, the track is still a masterpiece thanks to its earworm melody, but it feels a lot less alive. In terms of entire song omissions, I believe the raunchy riffing of 'Sixth Form Girls' or the completely kickass 'Street Fighting Gang' would've been a much better fit than 'Dallas 1 PM'.\n\nSo that's the theory, now for the practice. Heavy Metal Thunder is classic Saxon... say it with me - on steroids. Which is good and bad. The good news is, the broad appeal of tracks like 'Back to the Wall' and 'Never Surrender' has been filed to a dagger point, played with a Killing Ground echelon of unbridled energy. Biff hollers his lungs out through these songs with even more righteous spirit than most of his 90's output, and Scarratt and Quinn's solos scintillate with so much more complexity from all the extra years of practice. The bad news? Perhaps you can guess; I've already given you some clues. \n\nThe very glossy paintjob? The crowd-noise rant, which seemed petty, even for me? All the subtleties, all the atmosphere, and much of the technical finesse - particularly in my beloved 'Princess of the Night' - is gone. Lived its life like a candle in a category five hurricane. Between the extra thick production and the band's tendency to play every note in fortissimo, brute force has complete control while precision is left patiently waiting for its safeword. Even as someone introduced to Saxon via Killing Ground, I'm pretty bummed about this, and found myself sorely missing a lot of the subtle intricacies of the original versions.\n\nBut I'm not just equivocating when I say Heavy Metal Thunder is still a well-performed collection of Saxon's homeruns. Believe it or not, there are plenty of occasions where I choose to listen to the re-records over the originals. As such, I would recommend this to just about any Saxon fan... except Saxon newbies staring wide-eyed at the bajillions of Saxon albums wondering which is a good jumping-on point. Heavy Metal Thunder might be a tempting choice that appears to be Saxon's CliffsNotes, but you really owe it to yourself to hear the classics first.\n",
        "\nPerhaps I shouldn't be so forthcoming with this information, but I figure you have a right to know: Saxon's fifteenth studio album Killing Ground, was my very first Saxon album. And with a single sentence, the credibility of this review falls apart faster than Tom Green's film career after Freddy Got Fingered. We all know that nostalgia is a shield that can protect the most damning fault from the most draconian punishment. So if you're still here, willing to hear me blather about an album I grew up with, and, alongside 'Ace of Spades' from the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 soundtrack, introduced me to the raunchy paradise that is NWOBHM, I commend your bravery and advise donning a poncho for the incoming monsoon of Saxon fanboy spittle.\n\nBasically, Killing Ground is Metalhead's blunt force braggadocio tempered by both their newfound obsession with classic Europower metal, and a dreamy reminiscence of their old-timey blues songwriting. The latter is more overt than ever, with this album boasting outright Motown-style cruisers like 'Coming Home' and 'You Don't Know What You've Got'. Perhaps Saxon found inspiration in Mot\u00f6rhead's 'return to roots' album Snake Bite Love, or perhaps they just felt the reinstatement of swanky guitar leads and bluesy warbling was well in order after it had been collecting dust throughout the past three albums. Either way, I'm on board.\n\nIf you aren't, fear not; Saxon manages to cater to the high-energy crowd as well. The thunderous, anthemic chorus of the title track and the tempestuous charge of 'Deeds of Glory' manage to hybridize the burly punching power of Metalhead with melodic guitar passages and triumphant vocal harmonies. It's very possible to describe the result as \"too commercial\", but that roughly translates to \"80's Accept\", which directly translates to awesome. Of the very consistent cuts, my personal favorite must be 'Dragons Lair'. Although no relation to the Don Bluth game, it's still Saxon's nerdiest foray yet, featuring baroque, Malmsteen guitar sweeps and Biff's stratospheric wails about a dragon sitting on a \"horde of golden splendor\". This track also serves as a bold reminder of Biff's phenomenal range, coinciding with mindbogglingly high guitar leads like it was nothing.\n\nWhich provides me a not-so-flattering segue into this album's aforementioned most damning fault. Remember when I said Unleash the Beast and Metalhead were free from the harrowing vices of 90's metal? Funny story about that. I may have spoke a bit too soon. Biff's voice in 'Shadows on the Wall' is entombed beneath some ungodly flanger and distortion effects. Not only that, but a comically repetitive chug-craft bordering on nu-metal pollutes 'Running for the Border'. It's an example of Saxon attempting to introduce modernity to their inherently old-fashioned songwriting, going badly, badly awry.\n\nThankfully the zeitgeists of early-2000's metal are shortlived, overshadowed by marvelous moments like their cover of the King Crimson classic 'The Court of the Crimson King'. It's good to to see Saxon hasn't lost their progressive edge, managing to retain practically all of the ponderous subtleties of the prog rock cornerstone, while still managing to buff it up with a bit of trademark Saxon muscle. But then, I'm a bit biased because I heard this version years before the original. \n\nFinally, the icing on the Killing Ground cake is that some releases included a bonus CD featuring heavier, re-recorded versions of their greatest hits. It would later be expanded upon and sold as Heavy Metal Thunder. I'd say that's worth a little looksee of its own, wouldn't you?\n",
        "\nPast experience dictates when a band pours their heart and soul into the wildest, most uninhibited album of their career, the general populace will be too busy plucking their sack hairs to notice. Such is the case with most of my all-time favorite albums like Nosferatu, Thundersteel, and Painkiller. Miraculously, Saxon's Unleash the Beast managed to avoid mention in this hapless and infinitely depressing list. Enjoying chart success in Europe and sold-out tours that opened for everyone from Deep Purple to Dio, Unleash the Beast was one of the few instances in 90's heavy metal where hard work actually paid off. But it also came at a price.\n\nSustaining a shoulder injury during one of the two billion hours of live shows in 1998, long-time Saxon drummer Nigel Glockler was sent to the bleachers and temporarily replaced by Sinner drummer Fritz Randow. Which is fine. I actually like Sinner quite a bit, and Randow's most recent work was for the severely underrated The Nature of Evil in 1998, which is similar in ideology to both Unleash the Beast and Metalhead. The real problem is, with the perpetual touring schedule, and the lineup, label, and producer changes, one must wonder if Saxon left themselves with enough time to make Metalhead just as mindblowing as the album that preceded it. The short answer is no.\n\nAlthough functionally very similar to their previous metal barrage, Metalhead is marred by a few conspicuous issues that make it a less enjoyable experience overall. Foremost among them is the brickwalled production bestowed by the typically-talented Charlie Bauerfeind. Although Quinn and Scarratt's guitar tone sounds more dense and meaty than ever (quite similar to Rage's Soundchaser, another brilliant album produced by Bauerfeind), too often it's overpowering. This leaves the bottom-end floundering in some nebulous, distorted burble. I recognize the irony of whining about the production of an album called Metalhead, but this issue is compounded by the oversimplified songwriting. Riffs, however hulking and destructive they may sound throughout tracks like 'Piss Off' and 'Prisoner', are a touch on the shallow side for my taste. They're repetitive, and simply not adventurous enough to keep a four or five minute song afloat.\n\nThankfully there are also plenty of exceptions, unlike the woefully populated Dogs of War. Technical skill consolidates with raw power in brilliant tracks like 'All Guns Blazing', the title track, and my personal favorite 'Conquistador'. This track boasts everything from savage rolling drumlines reminiscent of the Saxon luminary 'Battlecry', to truly stentorian bellows from Biff. Meanwhile, 'All Guns Blazing' is a firestorm of breakneck drum fills, Biff's higher registers, and a chorus delivered with an incredible amount of speed metal frenzy. It's the sound of Saxon writing Unleash the Beast 2.0, but sadly the entire album couldn't keep that sort of pace up. \n\nHaving said that, Metalhead is still an underappreciated gem of late 90's traditional metal, in many ways similar to where Udo Dirkschneider's solo career was at this point. Timebomb, the eccentric masterpiece, was followed by the comparitively spartan and appropriately-titled Solid. Still, Metalhead resisted the urge to lapse back into commercial balladry or radio rock, instead writing some of their loudest and proudest metal statements up until this point. So it's two steps forward and two steps back. Not exactly progress, but at least Saxon is getting some exercise.\n",
        "\nTo echo what many women declare while tearing my pants off; \"It's time... to Unleash the Beast\". And unlike the women, I am not disappointed. The most appropriately-named Saxon album was born in the extremely unflattering year of 1997; a time when two hours of over-processed mid-tempo flatulence was considered value for money. In spite of this ethos, and in spite of parting ways with guitarist and chief songwriter Graham Oliver, and in spite of literally everything, Unleash the Beast is Saxon's moodiest, and most defiantly 'metal' release of their entire career.\n\nIf you think I'm setting up a tired \"This is Saxon's Painkiller\" analogy, you'd only be half-right. Like Painkiller, this album is a frothy-mouthed hyperbole of Saxon's natural curvature, cranking all the dials to eleven and fighting for their integrity like a rampaging circus elephant. And after being liberated by the inhumane shackles of 90's radio rock, can you blame them? Incisive riffs retain semblances of their progressive blues heritage, yet are also injected with venomous audacity like Dio and Ozzy's solo work. The best examples of this tropical fusion are 'Bloodletter' and the title track; two unadulterated heavy metal bonfires characterized by beltfed machine gun drumming, blazing guitar duels between Quinn and newcomer Doug Scarrat, and Biff's soulful, melodic vocal harmonies perched above it all like the cherry on top.\n\nI wouldn't blame anyone for being skeptical about the cherry part. Up until now, Biff's chirruped his way through glam rock ballads that Vandenberg wouldn't touch without putting gloves on. To go from spearheading 'Northern Lady ft. Elton John' to a supposedly Dio-esque album, is like going from Yoo-Hoo milk to Peyote buttons. But even after all the Def Leppard coattail riding, twelve studio albums, and twelve million gigs, Biff can unleash fiery roars that retain their melody and display mastery over a phenomenal range. He delivers my personal favorite performance in 'Cut out the Disease', a dark and menacing number far more ominous than anything Saxon has delivered up until this point.\n\nMenacing is an ample word to describe the album in its entirety. Unlike any album before or after, there seems to stormy clouds of resentment hovering over Unleash the Beast, possibly as a result of all the unsold copies of Dogs of War. It conveys this with an oppressive atmosphere, overcooked guitar tone, and lyrical content that shifts restlessly from b-movie horror worship to embittered social commentary. Metaphorically and literally, Unleash the Beast is the sound of a band coming back with a vengeance.\n\nAnd thus this album rests neatly inside my \"In case of Saxon argument, break glass\" container. It proves Saxon has a distinguishable sound, it proves they're capable of rebounding after an obscenely long losing-streak, and as a bonus, it proves not all late-90's metal was dead on arrival. It's truly remarkable that not one stray vocal effect, grunge breakdown, or groove riff slips through the cracks. This alone makes it a must-listen for any Saxon fan. And boy oh boy, this band is far from finished.\n",
        "\nYou know what gets my goat faster than a kleptomaniac satanist? When people claim an album is \"underappreciated\", when what they mean is \"two tracks are actually decent\". Not naming names, but one example rhymes with Thugchugulator. Saxon, unfortunately, boasts two examples of this pernicious trope, the first being Power & the Glory. An album cherished by some, and fortunate enough to predate all of the ill-fated Def Leppard asprirations, was still a painfully boring funeral procession of forgettable commercial rock filler with the occasional standout. Sadly, Saxon's triumphant 90's blues metal recollection yields to a worryingly familiar album called Dogs of War.\n\nThe amount of barebones fluff contained within Dogs of Snore is beyond belief. After you've waded through the brackish filler, not to mention been punched in the groin by some truly abysmal country-rock cruisers, you'll be in no fit shape to enjoy the very lonesome standouts. The title track is one of them; a ballsy, unforgettable anthem propelled by beefy riffs and some of Biff's grimmest lyricism yet. 'Big Twin Rolling (Coming Home)' is the other, featuring clockwork rhythms and spunky guitar leads that will remind listeners of Al Atkins' fantastic solo work. Demonstrations of Saxon's rock 'n' roll pedigree and blues metal mastery both end here.\n\nStreamlined cuts of hard rock like 'Burning Wheels' and 'Demolition Alley' are tailored to the more informal Saxon fan, who can make do with mindless riffs and uninventive, metronome-like rhythms. It has a lot in common with the vainglorious likes of Aerosmith's Get a Grip; diluted radio rock with insultingly oversimplified song structures. Keep in mind that this isn't the most searing indictment I could give an album. By its very nature, Dogs of War was written to be innocuous and \"listenable\", so its reluctance to push the boat out is both a damning fault and saving grace.\n\nThat is, until we suffer through the atrocious country & western crooners I mentioned earlier. I wish with all my heart this was hyperbole: 'Hold On' sounds like something by Taylor Swift. Everything from the sodden major-scale chords to the saccharine subject matter, these pitiable songs bare the same vapid accouterments that took M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce down a peg or two hundred after their first two brilliant albums. Saxon, in their attempt to experiment with more subgenres than Voivod, suddenly find themselves dead in the water with go-nowhere 'western metal', complete with acoustic twangs and Biff sounding like Dale from King of the Hill. And I include the vastly overrated 'The Great White Buffalo' in my list of grievances, which absolutely pales in comparison to the previous meditative ballad 'Iron Wheels'.\n\nSo after 'Hold On' and all of our required insulin shots, am I ready to call Dogs of War an atrocity, doomed to reside in the same dank bargain bins as Destiny? Believe it or not, not exactly. This album is at least partially rescued by a wonderfully crisp production, which distances it from Power & the Glory, which sounds like it was recorded on a Furby. And what's more, to reiterate, Dogs of War is listenable. Certainly not the most offensive thing the mid-90's had on offer, but I know Saxon is better than this. In fact, we'll all know very soon.\n",
        "\nThe 1990's were a harrowing time even for heavy metal's highest theocrats, so a second-fiddle NWOBHM act sitting atop a teetering mountain of unsold copies of Destiny, didn't have the highest betting odds for surviving the decade. However, Saxon's troubled past awarded them with valuable insight that few other metal bands possessed at the time. Sanding down individualism for the sake of fleeting commercial relevance is a bad idea. Saxon had at least four studio albums to prove it, and thus carried with them the determination to not make the same mistake again. Solid Ball of Rock marked the beginnings of a comeback, and there was only one way Forever Free could capitalize on it.\n\nThe rushed, treble-heavy production. The loyal return to gutsy blue-collar riffing. The kickass (but unfortunately rare) Warhammer 40k biker motif festooning the alternate cover. From every conceivable direction, frantic shovels set about exhuming the buried sound of vintage Saxon. While an unimaginative rehash of the past might not seem like the most titillating way to spend time with Saxon, you know what they say about gift-horses. An overt realignment to past glories was well in order, as it was just about the only way Saxon could wrangle back their fans and potentially win some new ones.\n\nAnd they succeeded, with a welcome reinstatement of taut Mot\u00f6rhead-esque blues metal. While tempo and aggression rarely reach a boiling point, there's a demonstrable return of sleazy riffs and memorable choruses. 'Cloud Nine', in particular, swaggers into view with brazen Strong Arm of the Law affectations. There's a little bit of ostenatiousness to it - certainly the \"kiss your ass goodbye\" hollering in the chorus feels a bit contrived - but everything else feels so much more sincere than prior outings. And when it comes to sincerity, it's difficult to top 'Iron Wheels'. Eminently passionate and painstakingly delivered, 'Iron Wheels' is an immense acoustic ballad that regards the British working class with a majestic reverence. It's a personfication of Saxon, with a haunting melody and effusive emotion backing Biff's vocals.\n\nIf that doesn't excite you too terribly, perhaps I could interest you in the lycanthropic speed metal menace of 'Nighthunter'. Arguably Saxon's very first song to demonstrate their proclivity toward over-the-top fantasy/horror themes, 'Nighthunter' is a hot tamale characterized by the expert synchronous riffing of Quinn and Oliver. It was so well-written that 'Nighthunter' would set the stage for similarly theatric, horror-themed output featured in later albums, just like Saxon's 'Stallions of the Highway' did for Wheels of Steel. Not bad for a '92 rehash, wouldn't you say?\n\nBut Forever Free is not immune from criticism - far from it, in fact, considering some of its utterly throwaway filler like 'Can't Stop Rockin' and 'Grind', which are overlong and recycle the same tired hard rock riff ad nauseum. The Muddy Waters cover 'Just Wanna Make Love to You' comes across as a well-intentioned tribute to an extremely underrated progenitor of likeminded music, but I still habitually skip this track. Not because it's poorly performed or in any way unnecessary, but because it only adds to the meandering cruisers this album already has plenty of. And because Biff croaking the song title into my ear is probably in the top ten things I never want to hear. Alongside a doctor telling me I have a urethral prolapse, and the last eight Slayer albums.\n\nDespite this, I insist this is a fine album almost as rock-solid as some of Saxon's very first. A slight improvement over the comparatively tentative Solid Ball of Rock and a severely overlooked effort from the Barnsley Barbarians in general, Forever Free is a surefire indication that things will only get better from here on out... Right?\n",
        "\nSaxon's descent into radio rock mediocrity had been a long time in the making, spanning several years, several studio albums, and several collaborations with Sir Elton John. Such a convoluted web of incoherent nonsense isn't something a band can untangle with just one album, unless its name happens to be Ironbound. Thus, Solid Ball of Rock is only a comeback 'in spirit'. I'm willing to call it a courageous recital of long-forgotten x-factors, but it's far from a dramatic about-face from the hi-fi pandowdies like Destiny. That'll come later.\n\nWith far less emphasis placed on slow major-scale flailing, Solid Ball of Rock delivers a concentrated barrage of uptempo blues rock. Hard-charging tracks like 'Crash Dive' and 'Baptism of Fire' had been well in order after all the mid-tempo molasses served up by Crusader and Rock the Nations. As refreshing as it is to the listener, it's also had a profound effect on the band as well. Biff's trademark 60's rock howl is back in action, with his intrepid exploration of higher registers sounding so much more natural than the tremulous glam crooning he'd been employing previously. In addition, sudden firestorms like 'Altar of the Gods' lets Nigel Glockler flourish with a dazzling array of fills and polyrhythms.\n\nThen there's the way Saxon introduced their new bassist. 'Bavarian Beaver', which somehow isn't by Tankard, features an utterly hypnotic bass lead from Nibbs Carter, who stepped up to the oche once Paul Johnson jumped ship after Destiny. The circulating melody is somewhat reminiscent of Xentrix's 'For Whose Advantage', assisted greatly by the vibrant, bass-oriented production that had been sorely missed ever since Innocence is no Excuse. Although only a bass instrumental, there's a lot of personality imbued in this track, and I'm honestly weirded out by how often I revisit it.\n\nAnd thus, that abysmally lazy review title finds its relevance. At the turn of the decade, Saxon took their lumps, refused to throw in the towel, and set about proving to their devastated fanbase that they can still write solid, ballsy rock. It's not the most varied musical statement in the world, and far from the most ambitious, but you get the feeling that Saxon was at least setting up for something. And those somethings are about to get pretty wild.\n",
        "\nWell folks, we've made it. We've made it to the eschaton of Saxon's commercial phase, and the album regarded by many as the greasy splinters scooped out from the true bottom of the barrel. After the overly-diplomatic Rock the Nations failed to please Saxon diehards or glam rock lovers, Saxon was once again met with an ultimatum. Much like the ultimatum following their diluted debut album, Saxon needed to choose a sound and stick with it. And they chose... poorly.\n\nSaxon's self-purported 'destiny' was apparently sodden synth-rock ballads similar to the very same synth-rock that sent Tygers of Pan Tang and Tokyo Blade into a plummeting death spiral. So unless your name happens to be Iron Maiden or Cloven Hoof, keyboards are the equivalent of Tutankhamun's curse. 'Where the Lightning Strikes' and 'Calm Before the Storm' epitomize what you're in for; very basic mid-tempo swaying replete with 80's synth flair. It's the same kind of spacy British AOR sound previously captured by Praying Mantis and Hawkwind's Warrior on the Edge of Time. On some dimly-lit bright side, Destiny at least has a specific target audience in mind, and thus possesses some vague sense of purpose.\n\nNot to mention Biff's delivery, for the first time in ages, doesn't sound stilted during his usual bevy of glam rock filler. Biff's fluidity and composure was a surprise to me at first, since Destiny couldn't be any further from the original ethos of Saxon. And yet he manages to make tracks like 'I Can't Wait Anymore' and 'S.O.S.' sound relatively natural and free-flowing. In fact, I found the latter track awfully similar to some of the stuff on Yngwie Malmsteen's Eclipse, minus the neoclassical shredding. Which is like saying I remind people of Conor McGregor, minus the muscles, Irish accent, and ability to fight. \n\nBut still. It's the thought that counts, and I attest Saxon put more thought into Destiny than Crusader. Unfortunately for Destiny, that's not very high praise. And it's also the end of the praise. Let's stop being coy: Destiny is a hot mess, with a multitude of faults that will turn away all but the most broad-minded of Saxon fans. The most glaring problem, at least to me, is the abysmal, mechanical drum sound. Poor Durham. His only major contribution to the true incarnation of Saxon, and it's completely ruined by a horrendous 80's rock snare tone.\n\nMost of the other issues are just bizarre. Is it a coincidence that the aviation-themed 'Jericho Siren' follows the same exact vocal syncopation as Iron Maiden's 'Aces High'? Why does the album end with 'Red Alert', a fast-paced Racer X-style speed/glam anthem? Did Saxon seriously think they could pull off another Rock the Nations-style compromise for fans of their older stuff? Why would they even bother, considering most Saxon fans would've thrown Destiny out of their window during the Christopher Cross cover? They chose to cover a yacht rock singer. Somehow, Saxon found a musician even less metal than Sir Elton John.\n\nWith its unrepentant cheesiness and defeated resignation in the form of mono-chord 'riffs', Destiny makes for a fitting effigy for Saxon fans to set ablaze. Retroactively, it's a cause for celebration. This is Saxon's \"darkest before dawn\" moment, after all. Demonstrably, it is the exact point where Saxon stalwarts Biff and Quinn had the collective revelation that this type of music wasn't working for their fans or themselves. In fact, with a crumbling lineup, a record label that dropped them faster than post-McDonald's diarrhea, and a decided lack of mainstream success despite every inclination toward the ingrates, this is the exact point in time where most NWOBHM acts would call it quits.\n\nBut there's a reason why I'm such a big Saxon fan.\n",
        "\nOne of my favorite Aesop's Fables is the one where the son, the father, and the donkey all walk through a village. The dad's on the donkey, then the son's on the donkey, then they're both on the donkey, then no one is. And it's because the village is full of tourette's sufferers that feel the need to randomly shout out criticism, claiming it's disrespectful to make the father walk, cruel to make the donkey carry both of them, dumb to not use the donkey... I can't remember why the dad can't ride it by himself. Maybe the son had leprosy or something. Oh well. The moral of the story is everyone's an asshole, and Rock the Nations sucks.\n\nIf you haven't gathered this, Rock the Nations placed way too much stock on compromise, resulting in a practically incoherent psychosis of triumphant Wheels of Steel retreads interspersed with mawkish glam rock sedatives like we've recently been suffering through. The most notable example of each is 'Battle Cry' and 'You Ain't No Angel', with the former following the recipe for a great Saxon tune almost verbatim. Nigel Glockler cooks up a phenomenal rolling drum pattern, complimented by Biff's selectively harmonized vocal lines, and Quinn ties the whole package together with a memorable riff. This track by its very lonesome blows Power and the Glory and Crusader out of the water. 'You Ain't No Angel', conversely, is sitting at the bottom of the water, wondering why its lungs feel ouchy.\n\nThe dullardly glam tracks are back in full swing, ditching the introspective affectations of Innocence Is No Excuse as quickly as they came. Substanceless tracks like 'Empty Promises' and 'Waiting for the Night' have a decided lack of atmosphere, emotion, and well, songwriting. The major scale leads are like sweet bubble gum that immediately loses its flavor, and by the third or fourth minute, the circuitous rock riffs are only tasting of spit and disappointment. Meanwhile, Biff incessantly wails his polysyllabic \"Ooohohoh's\" and \"Yeahuh's\"; something that no one enjoys except possibly James Hetfield.\n\nAnd then there's the rose-tinted spectacles aspect, and by that, I mean Sir Elton John. I would've done you a service by mentioning Elton John's involvement in Rock the Nations immediately, as opposed to a barely-relevant Aesop's Fable. That probably would've gotten the point across slightly faster. Elton John contributes to the extremely manufactured love ballad 'Northern Lady', which is my pick for Saxon's all-time worse single, as well as the fittingly named 'Party Til You Puke'. As ridiculous as the 50's boogie-woogie motif is, I have to admit, it's quite similar to my favorite track from their debut album 'Still Fit to Boogie'.\n\nAlthough by and large a failed attempt at reconciliation, I think it's important to keep in mind Rock the Nations could've been a lot worse. Against all odds, it managed to bring some truly great mainstays to Saxon's setlists, which is more than be said of Power and the Glory. That alone is worthy of some kudos, but I'm afraid it's not quite worthy of a personal recommendation. There's no sense in settling for this sort of diluted compromise when you could either have Wheels or Steel or Innocence is no Excuse instead.\n",
        "\nSaxon are a band that I overlooked for quite some time. I first listened to some of the band's 80's material about a decade ago and felt that the albums were too dated and \"rock 'n roll\" for me. I love plenty of 70's rock, but the rock-style songs were not good enough and the metal songs were hurt by the production that was a product of its time. Due to this experience, I wrote the band off because I had no desire to explore anything further.\n\nA few years later, I stumbled across a number of late 90's and 2000's Saxon albums in the clearance section of a local music store and decided to make a blind purchase of all of them, despite not hearing any of their material written after the late 80's. Boy am I glad that I did! While their 80's material had rock 'n roll and pop metal songs mixed in with the speed and power metal moments, Metalhead is 100% pure heavy metal! From the opening chords of the title track to the end of \"Sea of Life\", they showed that despite their longevity (The band had been performing as Saxon since the late 70's), they were able to write quality material that rivals and often surpasses anything put out by their younger contemporaries at the time. Most of the songs (with the exception of \"All Guns Blazing\") range from mid-paced to slow, so don't expect anything like the speed metal that they flirted with at times, like the song \"Wheels of Steel.\" However, it is not really a detriment to the album, because there is enough variety to keep the flow of the album diversified. \n\nThe guitar riffs and solos are of high quality throughout the album, but what really makes Metalhead great is the quality of the songwriting itself. The songs are heavy, yet melodic at the same time. The songs have memorable choruses with strong hooks. As a result, Metalhead is a rare album that can be enjoyed by a veteran metalhead (no pun intended) such as myself while simultaneously serving as an appropriate entry-level album for someone who is just getting into the genre. The production is clear, but muscular, which helps when the quality slips a bit during a few moments in the second half. However, the album ends of a high note with the epic \"Sea of Life,\" which is one of the strongest songs on the album.\n\nWhile I often try to pigeonhole music that I listen to and review into very specific genres, Saxon's Metalhead is a great example of an album that should be classified as \"heavy metal\" with no further subgenres needed. Its strength lies in its consistency. Sometimes, there can be too much of a good thing, but Metalhead is varied enough that it is worth listening to from start to finish.\n",
        "\nAfter rock 'n' roll noticed Saxon changed their relationship status to \"It's Complicated\", and began dating a vapid bimbo by the name of commercial glam, it didn't take long for Biff and the boys to realize they were in hot water. Crusader worked about as well as the actual crusades, and Saxon had nothing to show for it, save a few lascivious stains on their heavy metal bedsheets. Crusader's sheer lack of memorability and soul makes it my uncontested pick for Saxon's worst album, and I say that with every awareness. Luckily I, as well as many Saxon fans, can take solace in the unexpected olive branch that is Innocence Is No Excuse.\n\nThis 80's rock outlier isn't a return to form by any stretch, but it's the next best thing Saxon could've done. It's what they'd been trying to do for the last two years, sans the financial shortcuts and plus their rejuvenated ability to write memorable songs. Unlike anything we've heard since the emotive ballads of Strong Arm of the Law and Denim and Leather, an evocative, mature, contemplative atmosphere pervades this album. Tracks like 'Broken Heroes' are positively haunting, implementing an austere yet forceful approach bound to remind you of Accept's early work. It may be a few rungs down the ladder from the mighty Balls to the Wall, but to even share a ladder with those bulging, woolly quadriceps is still an accomplishment Saxon should be proud of.\n\nIt's rare for a radio-friendly metal album to possess such fleshly qualities, but Innocence Is No Excuse pulls it off with effusive harmonized vocals and charged fretwork. 'Rock 'n' Roll Gypsy' is among the more celebrated tracks for this reason - it's snappy and laconic, boasting a fleshed-out song structure with timely bridges and minimal repetition. Joy of joys, Saxon has finally exhumed their knack for songwriting and managed to overhaul dreary commercial framework with their vivacious thumbprint. The proof is in the pudding: just compare the snazzy closer 'Give It Everything You Got', to Crusader's 'A Little Bit of What You Fancy'. One has held up remarkably well, while the other sounds prehistoric.\n\nSpeaking of which, this Saxon album doesn't sound like it was recorded in a cave, unlike the two previous efforts. After an abrupt falling out with longtime record label Carerre, the NWOBHM demigods finally got the pampering they deserved from Parlophone Records. Innocence is No Excuse is therefore graced with some of the finest production you're going to hear from 80's metal, with a phenomenal mix and engineering that could even give Metallica a run for its solid gold swimming pool full of money. You can discern every buttery burble of bass, every slight warble in Biff's vocal chords, and Oliver's plentiful guitar solos have never sounded quite so punctuating.\n\nIn many ways, this practically is Saxon's Black Album. It's superbly produced, it manages to deliver solid and pithy hard rock anthems (perhaps a touch on the samey-side on occasion), and is thus viewed as their best commercial outing for good reason. The sudden and drastic change in style and temperament might still be a difficult pill to swallow, but if you're ever going to convinced of its merit, Innocence Is No Excuse is the album to do it.\n",
        "\nI wonder how many people were fooled by that badass album cover. Instead of moshing to a massive motorcycle metal manifesto about Moor massacres, Crusader is one of the many instances of a brave NWOBHM daredevil diving from their stuntplane and parachuting down a canyon of forgettable, uncelebrated AOR nonsense. Power & the Glory, despite all its damning faults, still hung onto some lifelines in the form of its title track and sun-baked closer. Crusader, on the other hand, fully abandoned their old sound at the altar, doubling down on their new relationship with tacky, go-nowhere schmaltz.\n\nVulgar major-scale vocal harmonies and participatory clap-along choruses have never sounded quite so wizened and contrived as they do on this traitorously boring album. Throughout gaudy pop rock tracks, Saxon exudes a desperation to come across as this youthful, larger-than-life party animal, instead of a greasy, knife-wielding streetfighter. It's the first album where Biff Byford employs an onslaught of increasingly embarrassing whoops, whistles, \"Ohh yeahuh\"s and even \"Yabba dabba doo\"s to punctuate bridges. This is, of course, in lieu of his fiery barks and hollars inspired by the greats of 50's and 60's rock. \n\nAs if this devolution wasn't bad enough, there's also a drastic over-simplication of actual riffs. Meatless songs like 'Just Let Me Rock', 'Rock City', and 'Bad Boys (Like to Rock 'n' Roll)' are kept afloat with only a handful of inexcusably vapid rock riffs (see: chords) and metronome-like beats. You know things are really going wrong when a Sweet cover is one of the three most absorbing tracks. Their cover of 'Set Me Free' illustrates the palpable difference between zesty 80's rock cheese, and moldy 80's rock cheese like 'A Little Bit of What You Fancy'. \n\nIn terms of begrudging praise, the title track deserves brief mention for being a well-paced power ballad, and one of Saxon's first to demonstrate their love of ancient history. Adding to this very short list of Crusader tracks with substance is 'Sailing to America', a slightly less robust yet similarly-paced companion to 'Dallas 1 PM'. However both tunes pale in comparison to the standouts of Power & the Glory, which is like losing an arm-wrestling match against a younger version of yourself.\n\nAround the time Strong Arm of the Law came out, Saxon was so insulted about being billed as a rock band, they opened up their album and most live performances with 'Heavy Metal Thunder' just to prove their point. What a difference a few years makes, as Crusader is not only unrepentantly rock - as this alone would not warrant such scorching criticism - but an overtly uninspired and boring rock. If you're wanting to pull your head back, throw your hands up, and shake your body to heavy metal thunder, I'm afraid that ship has sailed, and it's not returning to the harbor anytime soon.\n",
        "\nLately there's been a concerted effort to sneak Power & the Glory into Saxon's prestigious \"Three Albums\" club, shuffling past the burly bouncers Strong Arm of the Law and Denim and Leather, in order to club with the legendary Wheels of Steel. At a passing glance, it all seems reasonable enough. The credentials are all there; the title track is an anthemic and unforgettable scorcher, and the sun-baked atmosphere of 'The Eagle Has Landed' has it sharing pedestal space with some of Saxon's all-time greatest power ballads, not to mention lending its moniker to three live albums.\n\nBut sadly the bouncers saw through this disguise and booted the filler-stuffed rock album back into the trash can it was recorded in. If any Saxon album deserves inclusion, it's Saxon, and not this aphotic, bloated, drawn-out compendium of geriatric cock rock. This album is old and it feels old, bearing a dream-like sensation of aimlessness and weightlessness that reminded me of every dull moment of Judas Priest's Point of Entry. The slow, plodding, major-scale riffs multiply like Hydra heads, most horrifyingly implemented in the half-baked Aerosmith xerox appropriately dubbed 'Nightmare'. It sounds like the credits music to every Adam Sandler movie ever made, crawling along with forgettable riffs and an extremely commercialized Biff wailing about being alone in the night.\n\nPredictably, I lament the surfeit of slow tracks in general. Like global warming, fast tracks have been diminishing and falling into the ice-cold, penis-shriveling waters of atmospheric power ballads. It's as if 'Dallas 1 P.M' became the blob that ate everything, gradually turning the sleaziest of rock 'n' roll anthems into a quagmire of mushy sentiment and introspective guitar solos. A commercial approach to songwriting wouldn't be so bad, provided Saxon had a similarly bright and vivacious guitar tone to Denim and Leather. On the same token, a crusty production job can be assuaged with kickass creative riffs, like Strong Arm of the Law. Both cogs will turn so long as one does. But nothing is turning in 'Redline'; there's no kinetic motion whatsoever in the shrieking, cacophonous rock lead that repeats ad nauseum throughout the entire song.\n\nMaybe I wouldn't be so hard on this album, if I knew it wasn't the culprit that clotheslined Saxon's winning streak, dooming them to play second NWOBHM fiddle to Maiden, Priest, and Mot\u00f6rhead forevermore. Under more pleasant circumstances, Power & the Glory is merely a colorless splotch of hard rock that's very nearly all-filler, no-killer. Rescued in no small part by the fantastic title track and the admittedly decent 'The Eagle has Landed', I'm afraid I still can't recommend this album to anyone but the most diehard Saxon fans. And steel yourself, brothers and sisters, because Power & the Glory is about to have plenty of company.\n",
        "\nWhat abundant truth there is in \"Denim and Leather brought us all together\". It was this album, Saxon's fourth in two years, that turned Saxon fans into Saxon cultists, abiding in the gospel of their sanctified 80-81 trinity. As solemn as the chants of praise are, I'm afraid there lurks some dodgy scripture in the fourth book of Saxon. Although no less sleazy nor catchy, a tidier production and more anthemic tracks tend to denominate Denim and Leather as Saxon's first outing for business rather than pleasure.\n\nI'll keep the history lesson brief: after steamrolling their way through the nascent scene with three big-balled albums released practically on top of each other, not to mention a damn-near perpetual touring schedule to promote each one, Saxon earned themselves a bit of breathing room in the ensuing NWOBHM frenzy. They took their time with Denim and Leather. They enjoyed some lunch, a comparably lenient recording schedule, and most pertinently of all, a healthier recording budget. And thus, Saxon's 'commercial sound' began to form.\n\nNot that I'm complaining, of course. As any Saxon fan knows, their next album sounds as lively as an elephant graveyard on Mars, so the spick-and-span glam sound of 'Midnight Rider' and 'Play it Loud' is by far the lesser of two evils. What's more, I don't use the word 'glam' as a pejorative in this context. Yes, Denim and Leather is accessible, and yes, it resulted in Biff Byford wearing some of the world's worst pants, but it also created two of the finest songs of Saxon's entire career. I of course refer to the unequivocally 'glammy' singles: the infectious power ballad 'And the Bands Played On', and my all-time number one favorite Saxon song of all goddamn time, 'Princess of the Night'.\n\nThe latter track boasts a host of intriguing experimentation. Up until this point, Saxon riffs were characterized by roughness and beefiness, yet now they're mostly palm-muted and delivered relatively subtly. It's still rock 'n' roll, by and large, but it's amazing to think how far Denim and Leather has strayed from previous efforts in such a short amount of time. Biff also follows more adventurous, harmonizing lines with a smoothness and vibrato usually designated to his ballads. And I can't overstate the skill of Pete Gill, who controls fantastic polyrhythms just as effortlessly as the pulse-pounding kicks in the bridge. Sadly this would be Pete Gill's last album with Saxon, later performing - albeit briefly - for the mighty Mot\u00f6rhead.\n\nSadly, the glam affectations came at a price. I've grown accustomed to a more equitable ratio of fast and slow tracks, and Denim and Leather is undoubtedly biased toward the mid-tempo rockers. If you'll excuse my blasphemy, the title track is by far the worst cuplrit. I'm no stranger to cheese, but the bit where Biff describes each part of a metal band with the corresponding instrument playing is just wretched. It's like something out of a children's TV show. But I'll go ahead and shut up now, because I need to save my anger for the rest of Saxon's 80's discography. The blundering mountain of AOR we're about to hike is daunting, to say the least.\n",
        "\nStrong Arm of the Law was flexing its biceps less than four months after Wheels of Steel. Just think about that for a second. In 2016, the most successful metal band of all time had released three albums in fifteen years - one of which called Lulu - and they were still praised to the moon when their 2016 'return-to-roots' album didn't completely suck. So I'll start by giving Saxon credit where it's due; Biff and the boys weren't messing around, and they were doggedly determined to capitalize on the success of Wheels of Steel as soon as they could. But I won't be going into raptures over their psychotic productivity, because if Strong Arm of the Law needed anything, it was a little more time in the oven.\n\nApart from a few itinerant instances of repetition and self-quotation, I take no umbrage with songwriting. Like their stablemates Mot\u00f6rhead, Saxon is very faithful to their formula. For now. As such, you're served a bevy of tire-squealing speed metal assaults like 'To Hell and Back Again' and 'Heavy Metal Thunder' - a song written in response to complaints that Saxon wasn't a 'proper' heavy metal band. (Fun fact: It was such an issue at the time, they originally planned to call this album 'Heavy Metal Thunder'.) Searing double bass beats and bouncing riffs bolstered by beefy rock 'n' roll chords garnish these songs, making them Saxon's most celebrated mainstays for a reason.\n\nNaturally if those tracks aren't to your speed, you're extensively catered to with a swath of addictive, blues-laden cruisers like the moseying title track, the severely overlooked 'Taking Your Chances', and the album's most infamous musical statement, 'Dallas 1 PM'. Their longest track to date, concerning the assassination of JFK, is a painstakingly paced ballad that even features an interlude that samples the real-life broadcasts of emergency services and news reporters. Although its effectiveness is profound, bordering on macabre, I believe it came at a price. Saxon, convinced they could be this noble and introspective on a regular basis, decided to pen more and more moody ballads until they eventually began replacing the teeth-clenching, fist-pumping speed metal sleaze altogether. Makes me wish Biff was visited by the Ghost of Christmas Future, who'd show him ghastly auguries of forgettable filler like 'America (Sailing Home)' and 'The Great White Buffalo'.\n\nI wish ominous prognostication was the only thing this album was guilty of; Biff Byford is sounding pretty haggard here, likly the result of perpetual touring and recording two screamin' metal albums in effectively one summer. Add to that the first definitive stumble long-time producer Pete Hinton has, and Strong Arm of the Law is sounding like a particularly indigent demo. Pete Gill's drums sound much more hollow and pallid, and Paul Quinn's fabulous fretwork is sounding inexcusably damp. This is particularly noticeable in '20,000 Ft.', and also provides a decent example of how guitar solos sound disproportionately bright in comparison.\n\nStrong Arm of the Law deserves the vast majority of its praise, and let the records show I do spin this album more times than my criticism would imply. 'Taking Your Chances' and 'Sixth Form Girls' are some of my all-time favorite Saxon songs, dripping with sleaze and unshakable catchiness. Even so, I'm afraid this album doesn't hold a candle to either album before or after it. Sadly, both the production and overall musical direction woes will serve as a forecast of things to come, with Saxon's slippery descent into commercial rock mediocrity enveloping almost the entire remainder of the 80's. But on the bright side, we still have one more incredible album to discuss before diving face-first into that steaming morass.\n",
        "\nThere's a time and place for sickly sweet glam rock like Saxon's 1979 Big Teaser single. The place is the fiery lake of burning sulfur, and the time was certainly not 1980 - the first year heavy metal took no prisoners. There was no more compromise, no more baby steps - every NWOBHM band imaginable was throwing haymakers like Iron Maiden, Lightning to the Nations, Ace of Spades, and countless others. If Saxon wanted to remain competitive in the ensuing British artillery salvo, they'd have to focus. No more bringing a decent potluck to the roast; they'd have to decide on their best recipe and perfect it.\n\nAnd boy did they. We can sit here and argue all day about which Saxon album is the best from their legendary 80-81 period, but for my money, Wheels of Steel could take on the next two albums combined. It's a bundle of finely crafted proto-speed metal dynamite, standing up to the test of time as a titanesque cornerstone of the genre. Guitar and drum tone is flawless, the classics are ceaseless, and the line between grizzled, streetwise crunch and broad commercial appeal has never been blurred quite so masterfully. Except maybe Ace of Spades.\n\nAs Saxon was consistently touring with Mot\u00f6rhead at the time, picking up some good habits was a foregone conclusion. To honor both legendary bands, I've made a drinking game out of it: every time this album sounds like Mot\u00f6rhead, take a shot of tea. The overdriven bass passage at the end of 'Street Fighting Gang'? The blues change-up and barking chorus of 'Machine Gun'? The frenetic, whammy-bar yanking solo in 'Motorcycle Man'? Oh, and don't forget the phenomenally controlled shuffle beats of 'Stand Up and Be Counted'. I hope you've made a lot of tea.\n\nSpeaking of keeping the kettle boiling, Pete Gill isn't the only bafflingly consistent member in Mk I Saxon. Frontman Biff Byford simply outdoes himself, his insistence on allowing his aggressive snarling delivery still retain melody bearing a cornucopia of fruit in the much celebrated '747 (Strangers in the Night)' power ballad and the monstrous ode to the road 'Freeway Mad'. Better still are his soulful, bluesy shouts inspired by and reminiscent of the paragons of 50's and 60's rock. So it looks like Biff got his wish after all: Wheels of Steel is a glorious cocktail of punk, rock 'n' roll, and prog rock, and mixed a hell of a lot more equitably than their self-titled debut.\n\nBut alas, although this album has every right to be placed on an altar and made sacrosanct for all time, it still isn't perfect. It's hard to view 'Suzie Hold On' as anything but a misguided harkening back to those dark times of Big Teaser and similarly doe-eyed pop flailing of the late 70's like Priest's 'Evening Star'. I'm well aware the track is celebrated by more than a few fans, and even frequently revisited in setlists for some ungodly reason. Furthermore, just as any sophisticated Mot\u00f6rhead fan will urge first-time listeners to venture outside the all-devouring realm of Ace of Spades, I'd strongly recommend doing the same for Wheels of Steel. I maintain it's Saxon's best classic album, but it's not particularly varied, and it does tend to absorb the spotlight like a black hole. Listen and enjoy, but keep a lookout for other great Saxon albums; there are plenty to come, and in years you'd least expect them.\n",
        "\nAs is typical with almost any veteran metal band, the earliest installments can feel a little... off. The debut album will either be tentative about finding a niche and thus rife with haphazard experimentation, or confident about finding a niche and thus rife with one very misguided idea. Not naming names, but Rocka Rolla. Saxon finds itself in the former camp; remarkably similar to their later output, yet an ever-shifting mirage of psychedelic prog rock, rosy-cheeked pop metal, and the occasional rock 'n' roll fist-raiser we're all expecting. As capricious as the result may be, I can't view it as a bad thing in this case. In fact I consider Saxon among the most interesting and versatile of their early catalog, unfairly shadowed by the holy trinity on the horizon.\n \nIt feels like a waste of my keyboard to explain that this NWOBHM debut was jointly inspired by British punk and the aesthetic of 70's British prog rock. Vastly preferring the brevity of the former and the mysticism of the latter, Biff set about spearheading a peculiar hybrid of audacious punk and atmospheric Zeppelin-worship. This is at its most overt in the brilliant 'Rainbow Theme/Frozen Rainbow' opener; a moody, enchanting, and utterly immortal ballad of NWOBHM. It's difficult to imagine any song more fitting to commence Saxon's imperishable legacy.\n\nBy 1979 standards, there are also a fair few vigorous tracks. 'Stallions of the Highway' is credited with paving the way for Wheels of Steel, and then there's my personal favorite 'Still Fit to Boogie'. This track boasts superb drumming, streetwise riffs with a responsible amount of 60's rock influence, and even a sizzling, prototypal glissando solo that would go on to become one of Saxon's many trademarks. It's also in this track where Biff is at his most flexible. Due to him already fronting previous incarnations of the band throughout the 70's, his voice is already sounding rich and capable of reaching higher registers with practiced ease. On the other hand, his bluesy vibrato affectations throughout the proggier tracks like 'Judgement Day' are a bit on the contrived side. Much like fellow metal god Rob Halford, Biff's best notes are the high ones. Best leave the low notes to Al Atkins and Lemmy.\n\nWhat's more, the enjoyable amount of variance this half-hour album offers comes at a price. The aforementioned pop metal comes in the form of the abysmally corny 'Big Teaser'; a track celebrated by some fans, but, at least to my ears, sorely lacking in substance and direction, much like the bulk of Accept's early work in the late 70's and early 80's. More discordant still is 'Militia Guard', an overlong Queen-style rock anthem that becomes far too complicated of a juggling act of harmonizing soul choirs, acoustic refrains, and noodly solos.\n\nThese transgressions are easy to overlook with a little thing called context. Shortly after 1979, Saxon managed to both establish their style and jettison all of the dated prog-experimentation good and early, in many ways like Mot\u00f6rhead's self-titled debut, now that I think of it. Coming up next, three superb albums, and no one can agree which is the best. Now where have I heard that before?\n",
        "\nFor an old band like Saxon, this is a tremendously energetic, for-the-throat album of hard-rocking, groovy heavy metal. Sacrifice is the band's 21st motherfucking album, and they sound about as good if not better than they did back in the day \u2013 actually, as treasonous as it sounds, this is the best album I have heard from this long-standing band.\n\nIt's just all-killer, no-filler. This is heavy metal with the fat cut out \u2013 a lean, mean machine of an album with absolutely no weak spots and no erroneous things that needed to be cut out. It's a very straightforward work and it relies on a long-standing verse-chorus formula for every track, but its execution is flawless and the energy and attitude combined with great hooks are what make this work. The production is clear and sharp as a newly-minted knife blade, and the riffs are pure quality \u2013 just monstrously headbangable slabs of metallic fury from a band that helped write the book on the style back in the 70s.\n\nEvery song just knows how this is done \u2013 the opening title track has a great, hammering riff and a shout-along chorus that rules. \u201cBlooood oooooon stooooone!\u201d Fuck yeah. \u201cMade In Belfast\u201d is a midtempo groover that will break your windows with the best chorus on the album. \u201cWarriors Of The Road\u201d - another kick ass, brutally good riff 'n' chorus combo. \u201cGuardians Of The Tomb\u201d is even better than that with its superheavy grooves and badass lyrics. It just keeps going, with every song keeping up the same consistency, no dead spots or weak moments.\n\nI think Saxon on here got their formula down to a science. The way these songs are written and performed is a great marriage of efficient and exciting songwriting with supercharged, aggressive performances. They don't do anything new, yet the tried-and-true traditions are carried out with aplomb and made to sound fresh again. There are no gimmicks here and the band has cut out everything that doesn't need to be there in their formula - every minute of this is great. For heavy metal, this is a gold standard album and more young bands should look to albums like this to see how to do this genre right.\n",
        "\nSaxon is one of those exchangeable old and tired heavy metal bands that constantly repeat themselves. They have released the same type of music in slightly different variations for roughly four decades. Over the past few years, singer Biff Byford has given more and more confused interviews about what heavy metal lifestyle is supposed to mean and that it should even be considered a religion. This kind of mindset is just one step away from the stereotypical image of Manowar. I'm still not sure whether both bands' opinions are an elaborate parody or a megalomaniac case of loss of reality. All these statements made by Biff Byford have driven the band to release another anthem about rock'n roll spirit entitled ''Live to Rock''.\n\nAnd this song sucks. A pseudo-epic introduction with poorly sounding distorted guitar riffs and electric sound elements that would have already sounded dated two decades prior to this release lead into a tired verse with simplistic riffs and a chorus that was stolen from an AC/DC song. Even the vocals sound like an average Brian Johnson copy. The plodding bridge of the song with overtly repeated lyrics and those horrible electric sound elements is saved by a short guitar solos that makes at least thirty seconds out of three hundred thirty-one enjoyable. At least the single version of the title track is shorter but not better for that matter. The worst thing about both versions is obviously the lyrics. Biff Byford tells us how rock music is the essence of his life and that we should also live to rock. Of course, he blames education and society for being too conservative and makes a list of all the jobs he doesn't want to have like being a teacher, solider or lawyer. While people with these professions are not as closed-minded as the singer might think and are actually also able to rock, they have a significant impact on society and make the world better every single day which can't be said about an average rock singer whose band already declined in popularity two decades before the release of this shabby anthem. The spirit of this song might sound cool if you're a rebellious teenager who got tired of high school or if your friends and you are drunk and decide to attend a rock show. If you listen to this tune when you're sober however, it's just plain boring and cringeworthy even though I must admit that the simplistic chorus is somewhat catchy. To keep it short, there are already thousands of songs with similar lyrics and the world didn't need another one. Even Saxon had much better songs about the spirit of rock music like the historically inspired ''Denim and Leather'' that was released almost three decades prior to this coaster (or frisbee if you take the vinyl version into consideration).\n\nAside of the two versions of the dull title track, the single also includes an acoustic version of the song ''Coming Home'' from the Killing Ground record. The track sounds like a country song that could be played as a filler on some redneck radio station in the southern part of the United States of America between Johnny Cash's ''Ring of Fire'' and Lynyrd Skynyrd's ''Sweet Home Alabama''. At least the track sounds differently from what Saxon usually do and improves this overall vapid release slightly.\n\nIn the end, I can recommend this song to those who believe rock 'n roll is the essence of their lives and those who like to listen to some old-fashioned country music in between their hard rock albums. If you believe AC/DC and Johnny Cash are the greatest musicians of the twentieth century, go grab this release and continue living in the past. Any fan of rock and metal music beyond cringeworthy stereotypes should skip this release. Same goes for all the teachers, soldiers and lawyers out there. I'm glad I got a promotional copy and didn't have to spend any money on this.\n",
        "\nI discovered my weakness for the music of Saxon at a very late stage. Due to the rather low quality of their albums such as \"Innocence Is No Excuse\" or, despite its strong title track, \"Crusader\" and in view of my own innate ignorance, I did not care about the works of the band. But one day I came in contact with them by accident. I do not regret it, because I like the albums that they released since \"Unleash the Beast\" with one exception. Unfortunately, this exception is exactly the here reviewed full-length. \"Into the Labyrinth\" leaves an ambivalent impression for different reasons. A huge problem is the technical implementation of the songs. The polished sound lacks of metallic edges. (Yes, with all due respect, they are old men, but I did not know that they have already lost their teeth.) Right from the start, the sprawling opener illustrates the dilemma. The leisurely rocking \"Battalions of Steel\" is well designed, melodic - and completely harmless. The solemn chorus of \"Valley of the Kings\" points in the same direction. Too much sticky emotion, too little metal. What a pity for the good instrumental part after the second chorus of this song.\n\nBut more or less the entire album, and this is the next serious defect, lacks of currishness. Saxon prefer to offer very smoothly configured tunes. Aggravating this situation, some tracks seem to be allergic against any kind of compositional ideas. The incredibly weak chorus of \"Crime of Passion\" makes clear that one is listening to a real downer and further mediocre pieces like \"Slow Lane Blues\" or \"Protect Yourselves\" show impressively that good bands do not always write good songs. (Unfortunately, the opposite is true. Bad bands always compose bad songs. I do not want to mention names in this context. This would be unfair to Sabaton and Sonata Arctica.)\n\nThankfully, Saxon also offer at least two strong tracks. The vigorous \"Demon Sweeney Todd\" is the most aggressive and fastest piece of the album. Among other things, it holds a brilliant part in the middle of the song. \"Hellcat\", the second highlight, scores in particular with its well succeeded chorus. Additionally, a third song indicates the potential of the band. \"Live to Rock\" thrives on an effective riff, although it is very simple at the same time. But its chorus line offers nothing else than the desire of the band to get radio airplay. Too bad that the commercial arena rock is not the playground of the English working class and lyrics like \"Live to rock / Never stop\" are painfully primitive, too put it very politely. However, irrespective of its rare highlights, the album is just too long and lacks of compactness. Quantity before quality is always a very questionable guiding principle. Hard to believe that Saxon were not aware of this problem.\n\nIt is up to you. If you like to listen to music whose degree of harshness is significantly below that of albums like \"Call to Arms\" or \"Metalhead\", \"Into the Labyrinth\" will possibly meet your taste. But if this is not the case, you will probably agree that Saxon made exceptionally a comparatively sloppy job. Although the contribution of each and every band member is technically flawless, the overall result cannot convince.\n",
        "\nArguably the strongest of the original NWOBHM, barring the exception of Iron Maiden, Saxon has been a beast of many colors since they first emerged in the late 1970s. Part of this can be attributed to their incredible longevity and continual output despite changing trends, though admittedly they ended up embracing a number of them as time droned on. Like with many bands from said movement, a lot of praise is heaped upon their early 80s offerings, as there was a pretty discernible link with the aggressive, riff happy approach of their output at the time and the early speed/thrash metal scene that took off in 1983-84. This was followed by a period of greater hard rock tendencies that culminated in what can be best described as a full out embracing of the hair metal scene by the latter half of the 80s, followed by a period of relative obscurity with the ascendance of grunge, followed by a resurgence that coincided with the power metal revival of the late 1990s, which Saxon signed onto to an extent for much of their subsequent output, though still maintaining a more traditional air when compared to the popularized Helloween worship and symphonic pomp that was big at the time, though they did occasionally incorporate those elements.\n\nThis extensive history lesson is necessary to lend a full perspective on what kind of album their 21st LP Battering Ram actually is, which is that of an absolutely captivating and hard-hitting straddle between their early 80s thrash-happy roots and their more pomp-steeped power metal character beginning on Metalhead. Though there were some strong hints at this direction on the last couple of albums, this thing just throws out any notion of restraint and goes right for the throat with a massive, punchy guitar sound that is about heavy enough to pass for Megadeth, yet comprised of a brilliant mixture of a number of NWOBHM trappings that channel many fellow mainstays of the scene from Iron Maiden, Satan, Blitzkrieg and Diamond Head, while also grabbing onto the speeding, Judas Priest infused yet chunkier feel of contemporary German metal maniacs Accept. The rhythm section is thunderous, the lead guitar lines are flashy, Byford's vocals are strong, sleazy and completely on point (literally showing no sign of age), but the real place where this album just brings home the glory is the meaty guitar riffs, packing enough punch to level an entire building like a sonic wrecking ball.\n\nIn direct contrast to the generally mixed bag of outright winners and otherwise passable rockers that rounded out <into The Labyrinth and The Inner Sanctum, this album just opts to close the deal with a massive riff assault from the very onset and just keeps on going until the finish with few breaks to speak of. The opening title song \"Battering Ram\" hits with the same ferocity as something out of Primal Fear or Paragon, laying out the speed metal with a crunchy tone and a droning Maiden-like harmony riff brilliantly, taking one back to the early days of 1980 when Saxon was among the most aggressive bands of the day apart from Motorhead. Similar musical stories are told through \"Hard And Fast\" and \"Stand Your Ground\", which offer up a similar mixture of thrashing speed with a touch of harmonic guitar interplay and enough attitude to take modern adherents of German speed metal while still maintaining a signature NWOBHM flavor. Occasionally the band will play with the atmosphere a bit with some keyboard additives like on \"The Devil's Footprints\" and \"Queen Of Hearts\", both bringing in a slight epic character that held on from their brief association with Freedom Call, the former also featuring a brilliant guest narration by Hell vocalist David Bower that could almost pass for a homage to what was heard on Number Of The Beast.\n\nThere is almost too much good stuff on this album to handle, and all of it delivered with such a militaristic consistency that it transcends almost everything that this band has done within their 38 year history, as presumptive as that may sound. They've essentially managed to bridge all of the best elements of their past together into one cohesive package while also injecting a modern production that just blows the top clean off the whole thing. It's arguably the most aggressive thing they've ever put out, though also one of the more theatrical and deep efforts when accounting for some of the less overtly metallic elements, particularly the participation of David Bower as a guest narrator as mentioned before, though it should be noted that the band's lone ballad featuring his voice in \"Kingdom Of The Cross\" redefines the entire nature of the concept into a nostalgic and somber storybook narrative with a recurring chorus refrain. An analogy could be made to something by Sabaton in that it recalls a horrific battle in a very visual way, but with a slightly more elaborate melodic content and more of an organic flow. Everything on here just falls into place with astounding results, proving both that a band's golden years need not be limited to before the age of 40, and that it is very possible for old dogs to learn a few new tricks.\n",
        "\nSarajevo, the 28th June of 1914. It is a warm and seemingly peaceful Sunday, until Gavrilo Princip, a young Serbian nationalist and member of a secret society called the Black Hand, kills the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne and his wife. His murderous action triggers a complex chain reaction. It leads to the outbreak of the Great War. Five weeks later, legions of British, French, Belgian and German soldiers fight on the Western front, far away from the place of the assassination and without having a clearly defined aim. With regard to the fact that they had no alternative and partly due to their patriotic idealism, they have followed the call to arms.\n\nThe here presented album takes us back to the blood-drenched fields of Flanders. The emotional title track concentrates on the tragedy of the individual soldier. Its dramatic, slightly solemn aura fits the topic. The song turns out be an example of a successful metal ballad, irrespective of its exact configuration. As a matter of course, the neccessity of offering one and the same song twice is always debatable. But both the \"normal\" version and the orchestral alternative add value to the record. In addition, Biff interprets the subject with the appropriate amount of empathy. But \"Call to Arms\" is no concept album and offers a lot of different facets. Due to its fresh approach, the lively opener could be the work of a talented newcomer band. But this assumption is reduced to absurdity when looking at the title of the second track. The steadily growing \"Back in 79\" shines with its polyphonic background vocals while the lyrics relate to the pioneering (metal) days. Fortunately, its music does not build a bridge to the very early works of the long-lasting formation. Perhaps you agree that the debut of Saxon sounds pretty gruesome, at least from today's point of view.\n\nOf course, the five venerable men are not totally immune against repetition. They offer more of the same, but they also know a lot of tricks to put the pieces together so that the overall picture is impressive. Additionally, the band integrates a few elements of its competitors. The vigorous \"Chasing the Bullet\" seems to be slightly influenced by Angus Young and his Australian rock empire. This applies in particular to the guitar line of the chorus. However, another inspiration is much more obvious. I hate to say it, but \"When Doomsday Comes\" is an embarrassing imitation of Deep Purple's \"Perfect Strangers\". To be more precise, it picks up the keyboard melody that appears at the end of the title track of Purple's comeback album of 1984. A good song, no doubt about it, and I do not want to assume a sinister intention. Nevertheless, I guess that this remarkable degree of conformity is more than problematic. Be that as it may, Saxon should not be dismissed as mere copyists. They mainly deliver independent songs and highlights like the powerful, mid-paced \"No Rest for the Wicked\" prove that the musicians are still not willing to think of their retirement. The same goes for the vehement \"Afterburner\", which borders on speed metal.\n\nThe clear and robust production of the album leaves no room for complaint. Due to the absence of compositional flops, \"Call to Arms\" is a product which does not show any serious shortcomings. Instead, it illustrates that Saxon still have a lot to say. The band does not lack of energy or motivation. It might sound quite pompous, but bands like Saxon keep the flame of traditional metal burning. They have no reservations concerning modern recording techniques, but the well established - only fools might say \"old-fashioned\" - song patterns remain unaffected. Furthermore, the lyrics, written by Biff, are not meaningless so that the songs feed the listener's mind. Maybe the title track delivers you the inspiration to read a good book about the outbreak of World War I, for example Christopher Clark's \"The Sleepwalkers. How Europe Went to War in 1914\". I promise that this will be well invested time.\n\nFinally, British patriots may add some percent for the cover artwork. Please excuse that I cannot give a higher rating. I have benefitted from the so-called mercy of the late birth, but otherwise I would have stood on the other side, whether voluntary or not. However, remember the fallen of both parties.\n",
        "\nThe end of the year 2015 is coming nearer. In order to prevent an autumnal depression, I have asked myself which was the best new track of the year. Nuclear Assault's \"Pounder\" (the song) brings back the sound of my youth in an outstanding manner. Slayer's incredible title track of their recently published album marks a massive milestone in the youngest history of thrash. But Saxon's new full-length delivers the cherry on the cake. Its opening title track presents one of these very rare riffs that have the power to split your skull in a matter of seconds. 100% metal fills the room and makes your head bang immediately. The thundering riff and the ironclad drums are the driving forces that form this twinkling jewel in an overwhelming way. Biff's vocals are relaxed and vigorous at the same time. Inter alia due to his flawless performance, the song is perfectly balanced between heaviness and seniority. (I wish I could say the same about myself.) In order to complete the generic picture, the programmatic lyrics are taken from the great metal dictionary. Each and every word illustrates the power of the metallic movement. Do you want to have a small selection? Here we go: \"metal church / barricades / walls will resonate / screaming hordes / decibels / concert hall / let the hammer fall / battering ram\" - and this excerpt is just taken from the first verse and the chorus. However, a brilliant masterpiece that embodies the spirit of pure metal.\n\nOf course, the British legend is not able to keep this quality level. Even God himself has some very good ideas (the creation of Mother Earth) but also some less intelligent thoughts (allowing Joey DeMaio to make music - nobody knows why). Anyway, instead of trying to understand the incomprehensible actions of the director in heaven, we have to take care about \"The Devil's Footprint\". After the celestial opener, this song about inexplicable traces in the snow kicks off the grounded part of the album. Saxon provide their usual mix of metal. On the one hand, they are not afraid of performing a powerful ballad (\"Queen of Hearts\", a solid song, only its torn riff at the beginning makes me dizzy). On the other hand, they do not lack of aggression (\"Destroyer\", another solid song, but it is a challenge to get used to Biff's shrill squeaking at the end). Saxon move between these poles in an experienced yet spirited manner. However, this is not the best Saxon album of all times. A few songs do not shine with intoxicating ideas. But I guess this is just a matter of personal taste. From an objective point of view, Saxon cannot be blamed for offering a stale, lame or lifeless album. Although the title track remains absolutely unrivaled, it would be a lie to say that the highly appreciated geezers have already shot all their powder after the performance of the opener.\n\nThe biggest surprise is marked by the bonus track. I thought that it is just another moronic song about the (alleged) joy of drinking alcohol. But the straight tune sparkles with positive vibes that remind me of the best songs of Krokus and AC/DC and scores with its relaxed atmosphere. By contrast, the relatively heavy \"The Devil's Footprint\" combines a bulky riff with a fluently streaming chorus and \"Top of the World\" also convinces with its winsome flow. All these songs have one thing in common. They profit from the masterful production. In my humble opinion, this sound is the blueprint for pure heavy metal albums of our time. Just focus on the fantastic sound of Nigel Glockner's tomtoms, for example during the chorus of the title track. Or listen to the perfect appearance of his cymbals. Apart from the drum sound, the guitars shine in full glory, too. They possess the necessary sharpness and depth in order to meet the requirements of the compositions. Towering about everything is the voice of Biff which shows no indications of age-related wear. With few exceptions, he sings like a young God. But I guess this is a matter of course. We may not forget that he is even much younger than this bearded newcomer. What was his name? Right, this recalcitrant guy is called Lemmy.\n\n21 studio albums and still going strong, what more do I need to say? Biff and his crew are reliable partners for fans of honest, handmade metal that cannot deny its closeness to the working class. Saxon deliver down-to-earth music and they do it with conviction. The old guys know their strengths and they are clever enough to conceal potential weaknesses. Maybe they should have shortened the album. One or two of the less strong tracks are dispensable. To be honest, I am thinking of the colourless \"To the End\" and, to a lesser extent, the very restrained \"Kingdom of the Cross\" comes to mind. Anyway, the overall impression leads automatically to a specific question. When will the indestructible band release album number 22? The waiting has begun.\n",
        "\nAlmost every good football team needs one or two outstanding individual players in order to be competitive. Having only solid workers may guarantee the right attitude, but their way of playing will probably lack of elegance. The members of Saxon are aware of this situation because, as you surely know, they originate from the so-called motherland of football. (Of course, England will never again win the World Cup, but I do not want to go any further into that.) It is therefore only logical that their eleven songs include some jewels which push the performance of the entire team.\n\nThe opener is driven by its rebellious riffing. While constantly marching forward, the song offers an intense chorus which is embedded in an aura of fear. Although \"Witchfinder General\" does not border on speed metal, it marks an aggressive and straight opening. Both the screaming guitars and the powerful double bass show that Biff and his crew members are still energetic and their liveliness has an infectious effect. Back in the eighties, Exciter sang about \"Battle weary Saxons fight the fight to grip the north\", but on \"Lionheart\", I am unable to identify any signs of weariness. The band convinces with a vigorous performance and the opener turns out to be a very good example for their joy of playing.\n\nLess aggressive, but equally impressing: \"Beyond the Grave\" represents one of the very typical tunes of Saxon. It draws its strength from the dynamic interaction of restrained guitars during the verses and a heavy riff which rolls out the carpet for the chorus. Its pleading vocals match with the lyrics in a very good way and the song grows with every run. But the same goes for the entire album. At first glance, it seems to be just another metal album. Beware of this fallacy. The British institution proves once again that it is able to improve the quality of a song with fairly simple means. \"Justice\" is actually nothing more than a face in the crowd, but a minimalist yet fascinating guitar line gilds its chorus. Apart from this, Charlie Bauerfeind has done his homework. The experienced guy knows exactly the requirements of this kind of metal and he was able to implement the songs in a more or less flawless way. The dry mix emanates the spirit of the unbroken genre while offering the right amount of pressure and vigorousness.\n\nNevertheless, the full-length could have been better. Rather meaningless tunes such as \"Man and Machine\" or \"English Man 'o' War\" do not offer interesting features in abundance. They just pass by without showing major defects. Compared with the highlights, these songs lack of those magic moments that have the power to attract your attention. The result is that the not very complex numbers can be stigmatized for their predictability. Unfortunately, the dignified, rocking \"Searching for Atlantis\" also suffers from a slightly unspectacular song pattern. A solid epic, but no stroke of genius. Anyway, the overall impression is doubtlessly positive and the integrity of the band does not need to be particularly emphasised.\n\nOne of the (highly appreciated) other review writers was of the opinion, that \"Lionheart\" appears as the incarnation of British heavy metal. When looking at the royal title track, I understand his point of view very well. But with respect to the German producer, the German drummer and the line \"Heading out to Deutschland\", taken from \"Flying on the Edge\", I beg to differ. Saxon combined English patriotism with some Teutonic elements - and the result speaks for itself.\n",
        "\nThe first, released in 1979. The last in 2013. Battering Ram is number 21. An incredibly impressing number. Saxon's latest effort has been hyped up these last days and has finally arrived. Often when reading a review of a Saxon album they are praises for staying so true to themselves; always releasing the same high quality metal, no matter what's trending. At the same time, other bands of the same class, like Priest and Maiden, receive loads of hate for not trying to emulate thirty year old hits. (And when they do try, they get hate for that, too.) To me, it's kind of the opposite. It's a lot more interesting to listen to a band who dares to try new stuff. I think that's why Saxon hasn't reached the same level as the above mentioned Priest and Maiden in my book, although I still consider myself a devoted fan.\n\nWith that said, I won't say Saxon's style is anything to talk bad of. I probably actually fall into the first category of reviewers as well as the second. Ever since the seventies and through 2015 (and with no sign of slowing down!) Saxon has released 21 fucking albums formed by the same tough, classic heavy metal, showing genuine love for the music they play. In that category, Saxon and Motorhead stand unthreatened. When it comes to \"modern\" Saxon, I think their sound peaked around The Inner Sanctum (2007) and Into The Labyrinth (2009), while latest effort Sacrifice (2013) showed a grayer, more dull side to the band's sound. And so I'm pleasantly surprised to start up Battering Ram, and being met by a more full, darker sound. It feels more modern in its production than its predecessor.\n\nBiff Byford and his unique style hasn't deteriorated in the least. He's as reliable as ever before and delivers every syllable with style and the authority befitting one of heavy metal's titans. Screamingly tough in 'Eye Of The Storm' to classic heavy metal shouts in opening title track shows a man who shows no sign of getting tired. 'Queen Of Hearts' shows an effective verse, with an almost hypnotic performance by Byford. It doesn't however quite deliver in the chorus, but gets repetitive. Nigel Glockler's solid drumming is perfectly produced to show his tight and well trimmed style. His rhythm section in the fast, aggressive 'Destroyer' is perfect. And at the same time Byford makes one of the best vocal deliveries on the album. The entire album is filled with inspired riffs and well performed hooks, incredible deliveries and an overall surprisingly well polished sound befitting the modern Saxon.\n\nPaul Quinn and Doug Scarratt trades solos and keep trying to one-up the other time and again. It feels like every song has a new treasure to offer from the two guitarists. The speed metal solo of the 'The Devil's Footprint' (one of the album's highlights) both rocks and gives a dark, cozy atmosphere at the same time. A few of the songs do feel like betting on the safe horse. 'Hard And Fast', for example, rocks some great solos but fails to deliver in full like other songs do. But it isn't just solos that the guitarist's deliver with great accuracy. A few of the riffs shows to be some of modern Saxon's greatest, as well as some leads. 'Top Of The World' is probably the album's weakest song, feeling like a 'Conquistador' junior (the original is from Metalhead (1999)), but still manages to deliver an incredible lead guitar part and a riff in the middle that just makes me happy.\n\nFor some reason I find myself trying to find something about Battering Ram to complain about. Something to point at and say, \"why the fuck did they do that?\" But I can't. Not even the ballad (something which has never been Saxon's best side), 'Kingdom Of The Cross' manages to fail. It's calm and easy, with soothing guitars and a spoken voice breaking Byfords almost menacing voice, and it leads the album close to its end. The best ones on Battering Ram are easily Quinn and Scarratt, and - of course - Byford. If I have ever doubted, that doubt is long gone by now. No one will be able to dislike this album (but I'm guessing some will complain anyway). I won't hesitate to say Battering Ram might soon find its place among Saxon's greatest albums in my collection. Actually, I'm not sure what surprises me most. The upswing since (not bad, but) somewhat tame Sacrifice or that it's possible for Saxon to sound so fucking inspired after 21 albums, like they were as young and hungry as on Crusader (1986). Of course, Sacrifice did have something Battering Ram doesn't. The fuck ugly song title 'Standing In A Queue'. That's probably it.\n\nStandout tracks: Battering Ram, The Devil's Footpring, Destoyer, Eye Of The Storm\n\nOriginally written for 'getmetal.com'\n",
        "\n\"Unleash the Beast\" is one of these albums that fail to deliver an untroubled listening pleasure. Despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that Saxon do not go beyond the usual, comparatively narrow scope, the quality of the songs differs remarkably. This also means, however, that \"Unleash the Beast\" includes some very good compositions which do not lack of aggression and straightness. They are the reason why this full-length is still not forgotten. Well, I must admit that I am not quite sure about its general status. To express it more cautiously: I still appreciate a handful of its songs very much.\n\nThe stereotyped artwork is no figurehead for the album, but its flaming sky in the background and the menacing atmosphere appear as an omen for the best songs. The most gripping tunes present a fairly dark aura. The fatalistic \"Circle of Light\" marks the best example in this context. Yet it is not only an uncanny tune. It also belongs to the highlights of the album, because its straight riffing shows the right amount of heaviness, pressure and sharpness. \"The Preacher\" shares the uncomfortable atmosphere of the aforementioned song. Its guitar work is reduced to the necessary, while the pretty gentle chorus surprises with its smoothness. But as I have said before, there are many songs that convey this slightly fateful feeling. It is based on the uncomplicated yet effective riffs. In particular due to the dominating mid-tempo rhythms, the guitars have enough space to celebrate their might. \"Cut Out the Disease\" is another example for the somehow dangerous emanation of the album whose production can be described as solid and adequate.\n\nIn my humble opinion, the aforementioned tunes keep the album above water. Of course, it is difficult to reinvent yourself again and again. Additionally, I do not deny that Saxon are caught in their history and their supporters have a certain expectation. This means that complex song formulas or speedy outbursts of fury seem to be nothing else but utopian visions that cannot be realised in the universe of Saxon. But I do not want to change this situation, even if I could. The traditional approach will always be the basis for every ramification of our most appreciated music. Nonetheless, conventional tunes like the fairly shrill \"Terminal Velocity\" or the unspectacular \"The Thin Red Line\" do not convince. Instead, they confirm an old wisdom: to preserve the tradition is no value in itself. But I guess that this is a matter of course. However, with the exception of the pretty fast title track, Saxon walk, for better or for worse, the well-known paths of mid-tempo rhythms while ageing in dignity. \n\nSumming up, this is neither a milestone in Saxon's discography nor a letdown. Okay, \"Absent Friends\" has very personal lyrics, yet in terms of music, it is more or less just an unnecessary ballad. Fortunately, I am immune against this kind of songs since I listened to a ballad of Grave Digger for the very first time. My ears got irreparably damaged in a matter of minutes. (Considering this, nobody needs to take my reviews seriously.) Nonetheless, metal freaks who want to consume their traditional stuff without any complications should lend an ear to \"Unleash the Beast\".\n",
        "\nSome albums are free from major flaws. Nevertheless, they have a serious problem. If there are two or three songs that overtop the remaining pieces in a very significant manner, I am always tempted to reduce these ambivalent outputs to their essential tracks. And it is particularly problematic if there is only one song that shows the full song-writing skills of the band. \"Sacrifice\" is among these albums and its \"problem\" is called \"Made in Belfast\". This brilliant piece leaves the rest of the solid full-length in the dust.\n\nBut before I dissect the highlight of the album, I want to give an overall impression. \"Sacrifice\" features the usual stuff of Saxon. Crusty mid-tempo tunes are based on straight verses and more or less catchy choruses. Biff 's vocals give no reason for complaint and the other four musicians also play their role in a technically flawless manner. But it cannot be ignored that the solidly designed tunes lack of outstanding lines. I miss two or three choruses which get stuck in my head easily. \"Night of the Wolf\" almost meets my expectations, but I always have the feeling that the band does not use its full potential. As a counter example to the aforementioned song, I would like to mention \"Warriors of the Road\". It is an actually good up-tempo number, but the band is running out of ideas during the boring chorus. Too bad that the chorus of \"Walking the Steel\" also lacks of a convincing idea, because the rest of the song leaves a positive impression. These minor flaws are more or less concealed by the sharp, powerful and clean production, but it goes without saying that the compositional shortcomings cannot be fully compensated by the technical opportunities of a sound studio.\n\n\"Made in Belfast\" lends the album the necessary brightness. Its fragile guitars at the beginning make room for extremely coherent melody lines that offer the proper amount of heaviness. They lead to an overwhelming chorus. Based on excellent riffs, the chorus crowns a song which describes the work in a shipyard. A metallic hammering and of course the lyrics express the pride of the working class in a very suitable manner. Biff takes us to the docks and great pictures of sweaty workers and wonderful ships emerge before the inner eye. Simply said, everything fits.\n\nGrumbler might say that \"Sacrifice\" just offers more of the same. I understand their point of view, but I would like to express it more positively. In terms of music, \"Sacrifice\" is another honest and homogeneous album of Saxon. Furthermore, I do not care that the majority of the lyrics does not deliver anything new. It seems as if the old guys are still fans of their music and I cannot see any signs of weariness or apathy. Quite the opposite, everybody performs with dedication and the band finds the right balance between harshness (\"Wheels of Terror\") and harmony (\"Stand Up and Fight\"). Nevertheless, something is missing. The lack of a greater number of divine moments prevents a higher rating.\n",
        "\nFirst off, it was a very nice gesture to put \"State of Grace\" on the first position of the full-length. This pretty powerless and meaningless tune marks the only downer of \"The Inner Sanctum\". It is one of these songs which are naturally banished on the eighth or ninth position of a full-length. But with regard to the fact, that it is the opener, it does not hurt the flow of the album in a considerable manner. Only a small damage results. Anyway, it remains a mystery why the band chose exactly this song to kick off the album. Yet from an overall perspective, it does not really matter that they get off on the wrong foot. Let us move to the second track and regard it as the actual opening track of Saxon's 17th studio album.\n\nThe band convinces with a lively and energetic output. The songs possess the necessary amount of pressure and they are brewed in accordance with the metallic purity law. Saxon commute proficiently between relatively rapid eruptions like \"Need for Speed\", stomping mid-paced tracks such as \"Ashes to Ashes\" and they also have a fairly mild yet impressing tune (\"Red Star Falling\") in their repertory. Its lyrics deal with the political turbulence that finally led to the introduction of democracy in the former Eastern Bloc countries in 1989 / 1990. Saxon handle this issue in a very good and adequate manner with the result that this text stands in a more or less sharp contrast to the remaining lyrical content of the album. Songs like \"I've Got to Rock (to Stay Alive)\" display superficial lyrics, but this is no reason to cry. Biff is no preacher and these tunes offer other benefits. Casual or sometimes angry riffs, dynamic double bass drumming and the charismatic voice of Biff shape the easily comprehensible songs. In view of his slightly raw yet very expressive vocal performance, he appears as the prototype of heavy metal singers. Each and every word is well placed.\n\nThe experienced band also knows how to find the right balance between nonconformity and catchiness. For example, it does not take much time to internalize the compelling chorus and the main riff of the smoothly arranged \"If I Was You\" and some of the further tracks also impress with catchy parts. Nevertheless, this is not an album for the non-metallic mainstream, because the mostly sharp riffs dominate the sound. They also characterise the monumental closer \"Attila the Hun\", the second track that shines with ambitious lyrics. Kicked off by a brief atmospheric introduction, it is brilliantly constructed and does not fall behind the epic tracks of other heavy metal legends. And, by the way, its evocative vocals and the piercing cries underline the top form of Biff, who acts like the grand seigneur of heavy metal.\n\nThe fantastic artwork and in particular the vigorous production top off a very good record. Due to the fairly lame opener, it starts with a delay of five minutes. Yet the following offering is definitely worth the wait. Of course, those of you who prefer the most complex entertainment do not need to open their wallets in order to buy this album. But all of you who have a weakness for traditional metal that follows mainly conventional structures should look out for this album. You will hardly find many albums that reach the same level of maturity, authenticity and credibility without delivering metallic fast food. In other words, a likeable formation has proven its loyalty to heavy metal - what more can you demand?\n",
        "\nThe first advantage of the here presented full-length is its title. No question, I have a lot of positive associations with the term \"Metalhead\". To be honest, I like this word more than \"veteran\", although this term labels the higher tier for the users of this website. For me as a German, \"veteran\" is closely connected with terms such as \"internecine war\", \"Stalingrad\" and \"unconditional surrender\". But that's another story and it goes without saying that I accept the rules of the Metal-Archives. Coming back to Saxon's album, it offers eleven tracks which cover a broad spectrum in terms of quality. Bands that still stick to the rules of traditional heavy metal must always master a specific challenge. Due to the narrow limits of genuine metal, the musicians are forced to write very good riffs. They are essential in order to make you forget the fact that each and every corner of the established genre has been already explored. Saxon are aware of this situation and the five mature men draw the correct conclusions.\n\nThe opening riff of the title track hits the listener like a ten ton hammer. The ironclad piece glitters with a mysterious chorus and its slightly eerie verses. Biff's voice appears slightly overproduced, but that is no problem at all. The title track - as well as the following \"Travellers in Time\", which is also emanating a secretive aura - follows a stomping approach instead of setting the focus on velocity. But fortunately, the band is too clever to ignore the fascination of speed completely. \"All Guns Blazing\", the third highlight, is exactly characterised by its up-tempo rhythm. The band combines aggression and catchiness in a smooth and effective manner. Due to the fact that its riff does not lack of refinement, the song enriches the endless catalogue of Saxon songs in a remarkable way.\n\nGenerally spoken, Saxon stay true to themselves. The compositions reflect the sincere spirit of the band. They do not suffer from external influences and this is both a curse and a blessing. Saxon are immune against experiments and nobody needs a new commercial adjustment. In this context, some of their albums of the eighties can still be seen as a warning. (Yes, even the eighties had its gruesome moments.) But the band also stews in its own juice and vapid numbers like \"Song of Evil\" with its shrill chorus or the adequately titled \"Piss Off\" illustrate this dilemma. Anyway, there are not many groups that deliver killer tracks exclusively. Under the bottom line, this situation does not require a modification as long as Saxon are able to compose strong songs within the range of conventional metal. Their unerring instinct for unstoppable melodic hooks is helpful in this regard. But the band is also able to shift into a higher degree. The relatively venomous \"Watching You\" makes this obvious. After having balanced the benefits against disadvantages, this properly implemented album cannot fully convince, but its pros clearly gain the upper hand.\n",
        "\n\u201c\u2026where were you in \u201979 when the dam began to burst\u2026\u201d\n\nA few pressings exist of this sampler named after a featured Saxon track \u2013 the original French, Mexican and UK pressings, and a Japanese one \u2013 and each mixes things up with slightly different band line-ups (which admittedly can be both cool and annoying) with some songs boasting release dates back to innocent \u201980 and beyond. \n\nObviously the main dishes for all versions is firstly Saxon, secondly Demon, and thirdly Rage, three UK bands that\u2019re already veterans by the time this disc\u2019s thunderclap causes sensitive canines around the globe to cower in fear. Dokken\u2019s far from important here given their debut just became available, meanwhile important\u2019s an adjective Heartbreak will never see without a telescope. Who the hell\u2019s Brian Connol(l)y? Yep, said the same thing myself. Well, he finds modest importance as Sweet\u2019s vocalist from \u201968-\u201979, snagging over three minutes of A2 (side a, song two for those unschooled in lp jargon) groove time to showcase the a-side of his \u201982 single. Aren't we the lucky ones?\n\nWith these eleven tracks comes nuthin\u2019 really unexpected - some metal absolute, some iffy fence-squatters, and some hard rock fluff that isn\u2019t a big mystery to anyone with any metal sense. Of course Saxon heaves upon us three helpings of the first expectation with the especially early hot-footed \u201cHeavy Metal Thunder\u201d (complete with stormy intro), the \u201980 single version of \u201cMotorcycle Man\u201d (despite info saying it\u2019s the album version), and not-yet-timeless anthem \u201cDenim & Leather\u201d. No brainers? Sure. \n\n\u201cLiar\u201d and \u201cTotal Possession\u201d, Demon\u2019s offspring, for me illustrate the difference in character of their \u201981 debut and \u201982 follow-up. \u201cLiar\u201d (released originally as an \u201980 single a-side) symbolizes the unrushed, kinda ho-hum disposition that\u2019d carry over to debut Night of the Demon, an album that I feel finds rough times pushing its own heavy rock around. Not always, but sometimes. Conversely, \u201cTotal Possession\u201d resembles its more animated home world of The Unexpected Guest that to me is almost a starship compared to its elder kin. Not always, but sometimes. The latter is the one to hear here. \n\nWhile Rage\u2019s total three album discography is more of a hard rock sell than metal, they have moments where asses haul over to metal\u2019s side of the fence and truly land some hook-laden punches that\u2019re hard to ignore. Unfortunately, the kinda ordinary and somewhat contrived (despite a promising pre-chorus) \u201cLong Way From Home\u201d really isn\u2019t one of \u2018em, however the slowly-brooding six+ minute \u201cThank That Woman\u201d is well worth the extra stylus mileage and with its near-triumphant song-ending soloing brings fitting closure not only to this disc, but their \u201981 debut as well. One of the sampler\u2019s best.\n\nDokken contributes with the modestly infectious \u201cNightrider\u201d (from their debut) and higher wheelin\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re Illegal\u201d (with info claiming the debut lp to be its home as well, yet never actually appears there; the tune\u2019s real homestead is an \u201982 single that happens to have a very similar cover to the lp, however the version featured here extends about a minute longer), with the second track secure on the lower rungs of the sampler\u2019s highlight ladder. Of course Dokken would go nowhere and disappear without a trace, and I\u2019m Helen Keller\u2019s older sister. \n\nSweden\u2019s Heartbreak\u2026c\u2019mon, the song\u2019s called \u201cThe Backstreet Kids\u201d. Even though no one could predict four teeny-boppin\u2019 brats would someday gather to become the Backstreet Boys (undoubtedly the impulsive go-to image of anyone seeing this after \u201996), what can such a Menudo-like title on an \u201983 metal sampler accomplish but unleash similar near-fatal deathchills upon unsuspecting metalheads. What we get is yer typical \u201982 crapmmerciality of April Wine/Power Play-Chilliwack/Opus X caliber that scissorkicks this track into nearby fens to drown. \n\nMr. Connolly lucks out a bit as Heartbreak\u2019s flatliner outraces him to his assumed throne at the barrel bottom, yet the guy gives it a decent shot with the mildly catchy \u201cHypnotized\u201d, but in the end is out of his league, especially when some new wave keyboards slice off hunks of smelly MTV cheese into our laps. \n\nYou\u2019ll find more (limited) goodies on alternate pressings, such as: \n\nThe Mexican pressing:\n\nThis edition (through Peerless Records, via Carrere) moves stuff around, boots Dokken and Connolly for an inclusion by UK\u2019s Spitfire (no relation to the cool matchstick men on the Scandinavian Metal Attack compilation of \u201884) as well as an extra Rage track, and simultaneously reduces and enlarges the back cover\u2019s readability by miniaturizing the typeset while offering songs titles in both Spanish and English. The record\u2019s center label blushes pink to red as well.\n\nSpitfire's active \u201cSo You Want to be a Rock n\u2019 Roll Star\u201d (a Lucifer\u2019s Friend song title if I ever heard one) balances on the line of cool and corny, decent and doofy, where bursts of syncopated cheering is the backdrop of its partially \u2018na na na-ing\u2019 chorus that\u2019s straight out of an awesome Bay City Rollers handbook, making this peach totally middle \u2018o the road, if that. Think I\u2019d rather have kept Dokken\u2019s \u201cNightrider\u201d. Rage\u2019s \u201cAmerican Radio Stations\u201d unfortunately isn\u2019t much hotter and is in fact a lesser attraction than \u201cLong Way From Home\u201d and a clear-cut downturn from Dokken\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Illegal\u201d, the tune it replaces. \n\nThe Japanese pressing: \n\nThis one alters the jacket a bit and comes with a good \u2018ol OBI strip prized amongst some collectors. Here, Dokken and Connolly turn heel at the sight and sound of Australian punk rockin\u2019 (more or less) rowdies Rose Tattoo, an act way more worthy of metal\u2019s attention than at least Connolly as well as Heartbreak. Not sure about that? Come back to me after the frantic no-frills of \u201cAll the Lessons\u201d and look me in the eye. \u201cAssault & Battery\u201d is slower and more methodical (i.e. meh), but still towers above the offerings of the latter two acts. \n\nThe UK pressing:\n\nThe British pressing floats us back up to eleven tracks, omitting lovely Heartbreak while swapping Rose Tattoo\u2019s virile \u201cAll the Lessons\u201d for what would become the sampler\u2019s eldest creation in \u201cOne of the Boys\u201d from the Aussies\u2019 \u201978 debut, a very basic creature in a Motorhead-meets-AC/DC mold that should be shot for usurping the much better \u201cAll the Lessons\u201d. \n\nOverall, most depreciation of Heavy Metal Thunder comes with already owning the three Saxon tributes (which isn\u2019t hard to do) and automatically knocks its musical significance down by at least half. Beyond that, the price of admission should go toward Dokken\u2019s non-lp gem \u201cWe\u2019re Illegal\u201d, \u201cTotal Possession\u201d by Demon, and the album\u2019s sleeper, Rage\u2019s \u201cThank That Woman\u201d. Of the variants, being studious to \u201cAll the Lessons\u201d of Rose Tattoo is an easy effort. There may be more alternates, but I haven\u2019t seen them.\n",
        "\nAnd there it is. Although not a flawless record by any means, \"Wheels of Steel\" is one of a handful of absolutely essential albums for anyone who wants to have a clear vision of what NWOBHM was all about and to understand how it came to influence almost everything done in heavy metal music ever since. \n\nLearning from the problems faced while recording their first LP, Saxon found a good producer (Pete Hinton, a man whose role in forging the NWOBHM archetypal sound is never properly acknowledged, IMO) and captured in the studio the sheer intensity that was so evident in their live performances. Conjuring the biker spirit that lived in rock music since Steppenwolf's \"Born To Be Wild\", mixing it with the obligatory influences of '70s metal (most of all Judas Priest) and adding loads of youthful energy, Saxon forged its own interpretation of what heavy metal should be to survive the '80s and created something that now is almost synonymous with heavy metal, period. \n\n\"Motorcycle Man\" is almost an epiphany, a near-revelation of what early '80s heavy music should strive to achieve. The simple-but-strong riffs, the intense pace, the unique vocals of Biff Byford...it's exactly what the potentially huge fanbase of long-haired metalheads wanted to hear - unashamedly upbeat heavy music played with unbridled enthusiasm. And it was so groundbreaking that I'm sure nobody even knew at first that this was the new metal they were looking for. Listening to it 35 years into the future, the crudeness of the whole thing is too loud to be ignored, and I'm sure dozens of bands have done it even better in subsequent years. But it sure gets easier when the vocabulary is already at hand, and that's what Saxon did with this single tune: they created a landmark, an example to be followed. That's quite something, if you ask me.\n\nAs above stated, \"Motorcycle Man\" was an instant classic, but some other songs deserve the same accolades such as \"Freeway Mad\", \"See the Light Shining\" (with a not-really-complex but extremely effective tempo change that grabs you by the neck and just won't let go), the nice semi-ballad \"Suzie Hold On\", and the slightly less upbeat (but equally intense) title track, among others. Personally speaking though, I consider \"747 (Strangers in the Night)\" to be not only the best song on here, but perhaps the finest song Saxon ever recorded. It unites a dramatic feeling (the suspense building of the lyrics about two airplanes with difficulties to land is near perfect) with a main riff that is pure genius, an opening solo to die for, and a driving rhythm that will make you bang your head without even noticing. What a classic metal tune, my friends.\n\nI don't think that \"Street Fighting Gang\" is in the same league that the other songs are in here, and \"Stand Up and Be Counted\" is perhaps slightly inferior to the others, too. But make no mistake, \"Wheels of Steel\" is an album you just have to add to your collection in case you still don't have a copy. This record resumes Saxon and also a fair bit of what NWOBHM was, is, and forever shall be. No less. And oh yeah, it also rocks like a monster, so you won't be disappointed with that, either. Believe the hype and go get it straight away.\n",
        "\nIt was a whole different world out there when Saxon released their first LP, way back in 1979 (yeah, \"when the dam began to burst\" and whatever). Many things we now take for granted simply weren't there yet, such as internet, global warming, cellphones, digital music and NWOBHM, to name a few. That said, it's just natural that Biff Byford (V), Paul Quinn (G), Graham Oliver (G), Steve Dawson (B), and Pete Gill (D) still didn't know exactly what to do with their music and it should come as no surprise to learn that it shows on Saxon's eponymous debut album, though was far from ruining it, fortunately.\n\nIt all begins with \"Rainbow Theme / Frozen Rainbow\", an epic heavy ballad slightly in a Uriah Heep vein and with more than a hint of prog rock in it. A good start, but not very representative if we're to be strict here. Then the band delivers \"Big Teaser\", a tune with a glam rock feel which strongly reminds me of Marc Bolan. And then side one comes to an ending with \"Judgement Day\", a competent (but kinda confused) attempt to write a convoluted song about the end of the world (c'mon, all metal bands have been there and done that). That means the whole A side of Saxon's debut LP presents no hints of their signature hard-hitting-metal-with-biker-themes attack, and that is to say something about how unsure of themselves the band seemed to be at this point.\n\nFortunately, side two comes to the rescue with the excellent \"Stallions of the Highway\" making a clear statement that an exciting new era in metal was just around the corner (or at the flip of an LP if you want to stretch the metaphor further). \"Backs to the Wall\" is also great in the same no-frills-heavy-metal fashion of the preceding tune, and I think that \"Militia Guard\" is a nice way to close proceedings, a creative number with a semi-acoustic epic feel and some nice twists and turns here and there. \"Still Fit to Boogie\" is, ahem, a boogie number without many redeeming factors, but it's reasonably funny and there's nothing fundamentally wrong about being funny, right?\n\nThe production is not good at all (most of all, it lacks punch and energy), but I guess the lackluster results of this studio visit paved the way for the heaviness to come, so it kinda was a good thing in the end. BTW, I guess the same can be said about the LP as a whole; it shows not only a band in search of its own musical personality, but also portrays a whole metal generation trying to take the '70s heritage one step further, but not yet sure how it should be done. Musically speaking, this is one for Saxon's (and NWOBHM's) hardcore fans, but those who fit the description will find a fair amount of songs to enjoy here. And if you're interested in the development of heavy metal through the years, then I'll also suggest you to give this one a spin or two.\n",
        "\nIf there is a slogan that could properly capture the spirit and nature of Saxon's current musical direction, it would be \"stick to what you know, but mix it up a bit\". It could be likened to having one's cake and eating it to since these elder NWOBHM statesmen are taking advantage of current studio technology to bolster an archaic, traditional style of metal, but it is definitely a formula that works well for them. This isn't to say that there isn't a clear rustic charm to Saxon's early 80s output, but the added punch of the instruments and the amplification of Byford's gravely shouts are definitely an asset to this band's recent works, along with taking a few occasional cues from some younger power metal outfits that they've associated with in recent years such as Freedom Call and HammerFall. It is in this spirit of moving ahead while keeping one's roots centered in an established, working formula that Call To Arms enters the fray of the 2010s.\n\nFollowing a very gradual evolutionary scheme, this collection of songs shares a collective commonality with its two immediate predecessors The Inner Sanctum and Into The Labyrinth, though differing slightly in its overall consistency. While the latter of the two in question and also this album's immediate predecessor came off as slightly uneven due to the massive luster of its epic, quasi-power metal anthems alongside more traditional rocking fair, this album tends a bit closer to the former album and opts for a more basic metallic formula with fewer and more isolated epic moments. The result is something that is more streamlined, though still something of a mixed affair stylistically, employing occasional lighter 80s trappings and massive sounding power metal elements, but otherwise sticking to a sound that is fairly close to the rocking, metallic and occasionally sappy as heard on parts of Crusader and a bit more so on Rock The Nations.\n\nThe mixture on display here, while a bit more nuanced then recent prior outings, is nevertheless nicely varied and in keeping with a varied display of older guard metal traditionalism and recent power metal revivalism. On the faster end, \"Hammer Of The Gods\" and \"Afterburner\" offer up a solid display of speedy riffing and energy that wouldn't be out of place on a Judas Priest album between 1982 and 1988, not to mention some killer lead guitar interchanges to give Tipton and Downing a run for their money. Bringing up the larger sounding, epic, Manowar-infused character of recent power metal in a similar mode to several standout songs from the last two albums are \"Call To Arms\" with a haunting clean verse trading blows with a heavy ended, stomping chorus (the orchestral alternative version further accents the Manowar tendencies) and \"When Doomsday Comes\", which while maybe not as massive sounding as \"Battalions Of Steel\" or \"Attila The Hun\", presents a similarly impressive musical affair in a shorter duration.\n\nFor the most part, the songs that round out the listen are a bit more in line with a traditional 80s album, though that alone allows for a potentially diverse affair. The result here is a two-fold mix of mid-paced grooving with an Accept flavor circa Metal Heart and lighter, almost AOR material that doesn't quite hit the Destiny button, but definitely flirts with it. Of the heavier variety of the former is a nice, chunky anthem of fast living in \"Chasing The Bullet\", with a nearly as heavy but more Ozzy influenced crusher auspiciously named \"No Rest For The Wicked\", as if Saxon were making a not so subtle tribute to one of the even older guard, embodying the characteristic sound of the song's studio namesake no less. Rounding out the list of highlights (which encompass about 75% of the album) is a rather jarring shift into keyboard-tinged late 80s territory, albeit with some recent power metal elements, in \"Mists Of Avalon\". While definitely on the lighter side of things for this album, this song definitely listens closer to what made Into The Labyrinth a strong album, and probably could have improved its overall strength had it stood in the place of some of the cookie-cutter rock filler on there.\n\nMaking an analogy of Saxon being like a fine wine would be a bit of a stretch since it's tough to content with the power of their early 80s material, but while they may not have gotten better with age, they have most certainly not gotten any worse for it. Barring a few really parochial old school fans that want an absolute carbon copy of Wheels Of Steel every time an album comes out, this is an effort that any fan of NWOBHM and its various current stylistic cousins can sink their proverbial teeth into. Make ready for the trenches mates, because Lord Kitchener says it's time for the Britons to reclaim the field yet again from the Teutonic hordes.\n",
        "\nIf it is stipulated that the 1980s was a period of volatility in Saxon's extensive career, the turn of the millennium has most definitely ushered in an era of rigid, militaristic consistency for said NWOBHM proponents. Whether one wishes to attribute this to the band learning the hard way that playing to a fickle mainstream with watered down arena rock is a bad idea, or just a continued practice of following trends in metal circles that began pointing back to a harder edged sound in the later 1990s, things have definitely tended quite a bit closer to a heavier, but still rock oriented take on things. If there is any gripe to be made about the direction being taken, it is that Saxon has found themselves largely repeating the same general formula with about the same narrowness as AC/DC. Nevertheless, for anyone that hungers for the sort of fun loving early 80s sound that first ushered in the Saxon beast, the past several albums have been a predictable mix of good and solid, and Sacrifice continues the tradition without fail.\n\nIn relation to recent endeavors such as The Inner Sanctum and Into The Labyrinth, this album shares a fair amount of commonality, though it differs in being a bit less lopsided and more consistently on target. A few songs such as \"Guardians Of The Tomb\" and the title song \"Sacrifice\" tend to stand out in having a more grandiose, to the point of being slightly power metal-like flavor to them, but the atmosphere is a bit more toned down with fewer keyboard elements and massive chorus sections than parallel songs on the two aforementioned albums. There is also a somewhat enthralling yet fleeting acoustic gimmick that paints the extremities of \"Made In Belfast\", but the overall feel of things is much chunkier and reliant on punchy guitar grooves and a pummeling metallic edge. Though some of this can be credited to a guitar sound that is a bit heavier than the last couple of albums, the overall tone and tenor of this album definitely leans towards a Judas Priest character.\n\nIn essence, Sacrifice carries that same early period spirit of raw aggression that doesn't quite turn into speed metal, but flirts with it fairly frequently. Much of what rounds out the contents of this album is about as catchy and captivating as the denser, more epic sounding material, but does so with a basic set of riffs and an old school sense of speed and fury. \"Warriors Of The Road\" and \"Stand Up And Fight\" are the most memorable of the bunch, with the latter having a slight bit of a Ram It Down air to it with a shred happy guitar presentation but an otherwise sing-song character to it. \"Night Of The Wolf\" has more of a creeping sense of speed and relies a bit more on guitar work than speedy drums to get the job done, and it also brings back some atmospheric elements into play here and there. But perhaps the biggest dose of old school excitement is the guitar solo section of \"Wheels Of Terror\", an otherwise mid-tempo crusher that shifts into a thrill ride to rival much of Primal Fear's handiwork.\n\nWith more than half of this band being well past 60 years old, it's astounding to think that they still have enough energy to make music like this, but surprisingly enough everyone is still at the top of their game here, particularly Biff Byford. This sounds young and powerful enough to have been put together by a band half as old as the one featured here, but with an execution that is just a tad too polished and nuanced to have been put together back in the early 80s when Saxon was at their metallic zenith. While it would definitely be presumptuous to fully liken this album to Wheels Of Steel and Strong Arm Of The Law, those are the albums that come to mind when trying to nail down the nature of these songs. It has become a bit of a cliche to say that one is never too old for metal, mostly because bands like Saxon continue to validate it. One could even argue that the title \"Sacrifice\" is a tad inappropriate, given that little would be lost in giving this baby a spin.\n",
        "\nSaxon is among the most famous acts ever to emerge from the NWOBHM scene, crafting some hard, driving, and powerful stuff. If heavy metal music were a country, its national anthem would be the title track from \"Denim and Leather\", 'cos it captures the fist-pumping, powerful spirit of heavy metal and its fans. However, such power was not to last, and one of the first stages of this decline is the 1984 release of \"Crusader\". It still carries some of the metal charm that Saxon is known for, but we also get a taste of the abhorred albums that are to come in the future. \n\nFirst, the good stuff to talk about. The title track is basically the highlight of the album for me, since it covers historical subjects and has a slow, yet mighty atmosphere. Historical subjects were present in nearly every Saxon album, even the bad ones, so it should make perfect sense that it they should show up here. Not only that, but the chorus adds to the mighty and majestic tone of the song and its topic, the titular crusader riding into battle. It's basically one of only three good songs that dominate the album, but I'll get to the bad songs eventually. Another song that I seem to like is \"Sailing to America\". It might be a little bright, but to be fair, its brightness only conveys the song's subject matter a little better than it should. The guitars are a little soft in some spots, but in some respects, it seems to show the tranquility of the ocean in the song, at least when the ocean isn't stormy. I would prefer the title track over this one, though, 'cos that one is harder, and more heavier than this one. Although it's also a little bright, \"A Little Bit of What You Fancy\" also has a very rapid tempo. Not only that, but it resembles the NWOBHM that Saxon played in previous years more closely than other tracks on \"Crusader\". It's got a NWOBHM-like bite to it with a heavy metal-based riff, but the backing vocals are mostly synthesized, much like those of Def Leppard. That's what takes a few points off of it, 'cos that's one of the big reasons why I don't like much of Def Leppard's so-called \"hits\". \n\nI've mentioned before that \"Crusader\" also contains the shape of things to come for the band, and nowhere is this more evident than with \"Just Let Me Rock\". Okay, it's not completely out of character for Saxon to write songs about rocking and give them a somewhat bluesy hard rock riff, but I feel that \"Just Let Me Rock\" is a hint of the crappiness that's on here. While that song is passable, \"Do it All for You\" is as pretentious as pretentious could get. It's at a slow rock ballad tempo, the synthesized backing vocals that I mentioned in the previous paragraph, and sugary sweet melodies throughout. Don't forget the much overused lyrics of \"I'll be there to catch you\" and \"I'll climb to the tallest mountain, \"I'll swim the deepest sea\". Come to think of it, those lyrics bear an uncanny resemblance to those from a Foreigner song. No, I'm not kidding, you guys, they actually might have ripped off the opening lyrics to \"Feels like the First Time\". Any more plagiarism from anybody, they might as well steal the main riff of Styx's \"Come Sail Away\"! I feel that \"Run for Your Lives\" almost had it; it's a pretty rocking riff reminiscent of the NWOBHM days, yet it's a lot brighter and, again, the backing vocals ruin everything. Had the song been heavier and less glossy, it would've been absolutely fantastic, a classic among NWOBHM songs. But nope, it has to be bright in order to please the teenage crowd, right?\n\nAlthough it's got some good stuff on here, \"Crusader\" is only a glimpse into the future, and thus the truly lousy albums that Saxon is to release then. Songs like \"Do it All for You\" should be the only time you'd ever have to hear Saxon creating sub-par music for sub-par people, and honestly, \"Crusader\" could've been a hell of a lot better. If only they put forth more good ideas rather than going for what was then the norm for most popular music in order to conform to social standards of the day. If only, if only.\n",
        "\nSaxon pumped out plenty of great, raw heavy metal tunes during the early 80s. It's what they specialised in. They had songs about motorcycles, trains, women, and metal. The songs were consistently heavy and enjoyable to listen to, and this particular album captures Saxon at the height of their creativity. From start to finish, this album has plenty of great moments to be cherished by any heavy metal fan. \n\nSaxon may not be the most popular NWOBHM band, and have certainly not maintained their success like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest have, but their early albums are total gems, and this one is fantastic from start to finish. Saxon have influenced bands such as Metallica and Megadeth, and it's not hard to understand what Saxon did to possibly fuel that influence.\n\nSongs such as \"Princess of the Night\", \"Never Surrender\" and the title track are total classics. Princess of the Night is a mid-tempo heavy song about trains (not quite what the title may imply) and carries a nicely sung chorus. There are certain riffs that may remind you of some early Metallica songs, and those guys, particularly Lars Ulrich, did indeed take a lot of influence from NWOBHM bands. \"Never Surrender\" is about soldiering on past the obstacles in your way, and serves as a fist pumping motivational song with its chants of \"Never surrender!\" In the chorus. The title track is possibly the best song on the album. It may slow down the tempo a bit, but the pounding drums are so powerful and is a great accompaniment to an anthem that is about the heavy metal subculture. It's the closest the band gets to arena rock on this album (think songs like \"United\" by Judas Priest). Anybody who is fond of heavy metal is bound to go crazy over this song. It's easy to fall in love with.\n\nAnother favourite of mine, \"And the Bands Played On\" is another classic, influenced by Saxon's performance at a music festival alongside other hard rock and heavy metal acts, and the reactions and the feelings amongst the audience members, sitting through varied weather conditions just to catch their favourite bands. It's something of an anthem for rock and metal music festivals worldwide, and the overwhelming passion of the fans going to these festivals. The music itself carries a sense of determination but also having a good time, which is very in line with the subject matter.\n\nThere are some very old school moments here, also. Songs like \"Out of Control\", \"Rough and Ready\" and \"Play It Loud\" have a hard rock influenced sound, reminiscent of acts such as AC/DC, yet they stand well with the more \"metal\" songs such as the ones listed above. \"Play it Loud\" is simply about fighting for your right to blast out hard rocking music despite the urges you get from others to turn it down. It may seem ridiculously clich\u00e9d now, but it is still a solid tune in my eyes.\n\nDenim and Leather is a very heavy metal album which carries heavy riffs and some speedy tempos that would pave the way for thrash metal. It is also one of Saxon's best, and there is enough to be found here to keep any fan of rock satisfied for a long time. It may not have aged quite as well as albums such as The Number of the Beast (Iron Maiden) and British Steel (Judas Priest) but its status as a classic heavy metal album and its influence on later bands cannot be denied by listeners. So, what are you waiting for? Put on some denim and leather, give this great solid album a spin and just rock out!\n",
        "\nSaxon\u2019s pursuit of arena-like hard rock / heavy metal landed them in a limbo of unwaveringly decent heavy metal. It\u2019s not superb since there\u2019s always something holding them back from delivering another knockout album that\u2019s good from start to finish. They pull off that \u201880s heavy metal sound like its nothing. On the other hand, trying to maintain my interest until the end of the album hasn\u2019t been done prior to this since Innocence Is No Excuse. This album whoops ass until about the middle (which is when things get dull). What the hell? The title track provides a cool, trudging heavy metal riff alongside (vocally) quiet verses and loud choruses. It\u2019s not as awesome as \u201cSolid Ball Of Rock\u201d or \u201cForever Free\u201d opening up the previous albums, but starting this thing off right by at least being a memorable song works.\n\nI listen from the beginning and get to the rocking and roaring \u201cThe Great White Buffalo\u201d. A tad longer than the tracks before, this one\u2019s got slithering leads and an epic tenor. It\u2019s a track with darker harmonies despite not ditching that positive \u201880s gloss. Up to that point, Saxon\u2019s throwing riffs and melodies that transition well and don\u2019t deviate too much from what they normally do in the first place. It\u2019s all hard rock and heavy metal with Byford\u2019s high wails and squeaky tone singing with gut-power. Even songs which I\u2019m not 100% into like \u201cHold On,\u201d a track that sounds like a beefed up \u201880s Bryan Adams song (who I do like) formatted to Saxon, I still dig based on what it is. The first half of the album mixes things up with variation that doesn\u2019t become detrimental to the fun factor. I enjoy listening to those songs since they stir something in me and nail the key parts with energy. \u201cBurning Wheels\u201d is the best \u2013 vigorous, Maiden-esque, and ballsy; another perfect Saxon song.\n\nThe drop comes at \u201cDemolition Alley,\u201d which meanders even though it doesn\u2019t disregard the tried and true formula. I suppose it\u2019s just the song as a composition which I dislike \u2013 the riffs, the hooks, etc. \u2013 it feels dry. The same can be said about \u201cWalking Through Tokyo,\u201d probably the slowest, albeit one of the heaviest (using that term a little loosely) songs on here. Don\u2019t get me started on how awesome Japan is - this song doesn\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s got an anthem feel, especially during that chorus, but it lacks substance. Just feels like a filler song with a corny part in its solo section and an implied purpose of reeling in fans during a live setting. \u201cGive It All Away\u201d is the worst with its throwaway chorus, tedious mid-paced riff, and thirst for emotion. The guitar leads are fervent by the middle and is kept up by the end, but this one\u2019s tamer.\n\nSaxon had this one in the bag but jacked it all up. They even topped it off right with \u201cYesterday\u2019s Gone,\u201d a song with crunchy riffs and motivation making up for the unexciting songs that came before. Add that the drumming\u2019s solid, bass is blubbery, and the album benefits well from sounding pristine by \u201890s standards to show that this album\u2019s pieces were fine. The end result needed tweaking (read: removing tracks) in order to be a better full-length. That\u2019s just my opinion though, and I can\u2019t speak on behalf of others. So hear this one to know what I\u2019m talking about and hopefully there\u2019ll be more for you to enjoy than what I heard.\n",
        "\nWhat happened to the guitars at the beginning? They sound muddy compared to the crystal clear \u201980s job of the last one. The soaring echoes are replaced by this middling electric tone without that surging power. That\u2019s my one major complaint, if a little exaggerated, since I do end up getting used to and liking it. Other than that, Forever Free is along the same lines as the last one, Solid Ball Of Rock. In terms of songs there are mostly fast numbers which have Saxon right at home. \u201cIron Wheels\u201d is the only slow one, so bar a couple dull songs Forever Free\u2019s lighthearted attitude makes it of one of the cooler Saxon albums of the \u201890s.\n\nFrom the title track\u2019s hard-hitting rock attitude to the blitzing prowess of \u201cNighthunter\u201d, this album\u2019s definitely no slouch. It peters out starting with \u201cGrind,\u201d though, going for easy-listening hooks. I\u2019m into Saxon with melody, yes, but when it becomes something that could be found on a family sitcom I find it less compelling. Charisma and energy are all there, but the velocity and impact of riffs beats easy vocal lines. Byford\u2019s still going strong with his gruff wails and boisterous vocals, but those last two songs don\u2019t hold much weight to them. His voice hasn\u2019t lost its gritty or higher registers, so it\u2019s a problem of actual vocal lines.\n\nGive me the mid-paced chomp of \u201cCan\u2019t Stop Rockin\u2019,\u201d the mauling riffs of \u201cOne Step Away,\u201d or the lustrous Muddy Waters cover. The eclectic leads and vigor on this album can be heard best in these songs. Headbanging will become an instinctive tick as riffs, licks, and harmonies fly. The production\u2019s balanced overall (less independent bass), so the clarity is high despite missing a little of that \u201880s pitch. \u201cIron Wheels\u201d is the only song on here that defies the cheerful approach, going for a somber, working-man\u2019s (manly) ballad. It\u2019s fully acoustic, with drums coming in as loud bashes. Byford\u2019s delivers an expressive performance as good as any of his entertaining choruses, but I would have preferred a song like this closer to the end (had the album been shorter).\n\nI can\u2019t tell if I like this more than Solid Ball Of Rock or not. Both have dull tracks, both have ballads, and both feature Saxon doing well for the majority of it. \u201cIron Wheels\u201d whoops the shit out of the slower songs on the last album, but this one tops out early, making me stick in for longer than I want to in order to finish it. The previous album was more inconsistent, so I don\u2019t know. The one thing I do know is that both are keepers regardless of how great and bad they aren\u2019t. They fall in that category of being good enough for what they are.\n",
        "\nDestiny was just about a piece of shit if you ask me. It had no soul and wanted badly to be accepted as AOR. Saxon came to their senses immediately and returned to the hard rock / heavy metal genres with that sharp \u201880s tone present. Production on this thing firmly brings back the power to the guitars and the drums crash nicely on the snare hits. The title track is a perfect Saxon song. It does everything one would expect them to accomplish: play with charisma, unleash a catchy riff, infuse some nice bass grooves, and pull off a manly sing-a-long chorus. Byford\u2019s clear, high singing is right on par with that surging guitar distortion. Now if only the rest of the album kept up with this level of quality. \n\nFor the most part this album is fine. I expected more of a lame streak since Rock The Nations, but Saxon turned it around and made an album with a handful of good songs. \u201cBavarian Beaver\u201d near the end was the biggest surprise. It\u2019s a short instrumental that acts as an interlude, demonstrating Nibbs Carter\u2019s slick bass playing in a calm manner. It reminds me of Jens Becker\u2019s instrumentals in Running Wild (just much less showy). It segues into \u201cCrash Drive\u201d which rocks with its own kickass riff and turbulent soloing. The bass on this one is also substantial and groovy, but the song only rides on these two \u2013 Byford\u2019s vocal lines aren\u2019t catchy at all. Prominent guitars and bass but your vocalist can\u2019t drop the ball! Bravo on adding some variation but man does it end the album on a mixed note.\n\nThere was always going to be the obligatory ballad (\u201cOverture In B-Minor / Refugee\u201d) which are tuneful but not exactly interesting or generally slower songs like \u201cRequiem (We Will Remember)\u201d which are upbeat but corny. They\u2019re likable, but when Saxon doesn\u2019t commit it creates problems. This band\u2019s craft is in composing rocking heavy metal that\u2019s ripe with melodic leads and addicting vocal lines. Those marks are reached on songs like \u201cI Just Can\u2019t Get Enough\u201d and \u201cBaptism Of Fire\u201d \u2013 hard-hitting, fiery, memorable, and fun. Drumming should be tantamount and click immediately, fitting with the rhythm as they echo in the back. Even when the songs themselves become a tad dull like \u201cI\u2019m On Fire\u201d (epic solo section aside), the drumming can\u2019t be at fault.\n\nSolid Ball Of Rock attempted to propel Saxon back in the realm of good bands. It isn\u2019t standout, but it didn\u2019t do a bad job at reassuring people that they weren\u2019t going to become a lame rock act. Knowing that this isn\u2019t spectacular, I\u2019d keep it around for some more fun songs. Nothing on here undeniably sucks, even if some tracks aren\u2019t to my liking. It\u2019d take Saxon some more time to get to their next great album, but before that they needed to rebuild the road they destroyed from the last couple of albums.\n",
        "\nBiff Byford said that the best Saxon albums were the previous trilogy (Wheels Of Steel, Strong Arm of the Law, and Denim and Leather) with Denim and Leather being the highest point. People say that Power & the Glory is the first step in the direction of the abyss.\n\nSo I ask, 'what is wrong with these people and what are these peoples' conception of heavy metal?', because Power & the Glory is by far much more \"metal\" than the previous works, works that had a much more rock 'n' roll feeling and production. Listen to Power & the Glory, Warriors, and Redline - pure astonishing heavy metal music, heavier than any previous efforts. From Nightmare to Watching the Sky, the pace slows down a little, but not the quality, and the fire returns with the bass pumping in Midas Touch (this song has a feeling similar to Iron Maiden's debut album, especially in the slow parts). \n\nAt the end of this masterpiece we have the classic The Eagle Has Landed, a great and interesting song that grabs your attention and doesn't let you go. By Power & the Glory's standards, the previous works from Saxon don't look too heavy metal, but look much more \"rock 'n' roll\". It's a great injustice that Saxon started to lose the attention of people here. I could understand if this happened with Crusader, a very disappointing album with just the title track deserving any attention, but here it isn't the case. This is the best Saxon album before the decline started in Crusader and ended with Unleash the Beast.\n\nHighlights: Power & the Glory, Warriors, Midas Touch, and The Eagle Has Landed.\n\nCons: the cover art is blatant and ugly.\n",
        "\nI guess it is not really a surprise that Saxon already got a new album thrown out into the streets, as they more or less have been keeping this 2-year span between each album for quite some time. Is that a good thing that we keep having all this brand new material or is it a bad thing\u2026?\n\nThe album contains the usual ingredients that you would find on a Saxon album. Good production, solid band performance and the usual stuff you would expect from Saxon. Biff\u2019s voice is still going strong, and I do not doubt he will be able to perform on a high level for a couple of years in the future, even though he has reached his sixties. Through the first two or three listens the album doesn\u2019t really offer much but then it grows on you a bit, and that is pretty much how it goes with a lot of Saxon albums post their \u201cglory days\u201d. I was, however, from the looks of the cover hoping that the Aztec theme would shine through and bring some diversity into their discography. Since that is not the case you can always hope for some new smashers, which there of course is. But besides that, it is actually not that different from previous albums. Some fillers and decent songs and then some tracks you can add to your Saxon play list. Other than that, there is really not that much to blow up about this album, as it has been done countless times before by the band.\n\n\u201cSacrifice\u201d also offers us five re-recorded songs. Just Let Me Rock, Forever Free, Crusader, Frozen Rainbow, and Requiem (We Will Remember). The orchestral version of Crusader is decent. Sometimes the orchestra is a little misplaced and doesn\u2019t quite fit the rest of the music. But it isn\u2019t really as orchestral oriented as it could be, but without hesitation I would always listen to the original. Adding these re-recordings definitely was a wise choice, at least for my taste. I love some re-recordings, of course the band already released \u201cHeavy Metal Thunder\u201d in 2002, which only featured such tracks. The two standards Just Let Me Rock and Forever Free are funny enough fresh takes as well. Though Just Let Me Rock never really got through to me and is rather forgettable, and that goes for both the original and new version. Forever Free however is a really solid take on an already good song and is easily a re-recording I would play some more in the future!\n\nUsually, I don\u2019t really want to listen to acoustic versions of tracks, I can\u2019t really come with any explanation. I just can\u2019t see the use in some way\u2026 But the first version Requiem (We Will Remember) which have been cut down in length which suits the song a lot, is actually pretty good. As the song already was a kind of a ballad but maybe a little to long in duration, this acoustic version serves the track a lot of justice and it definitely something I will listen to again! Now, Frozen Rainbow is one of my favourite songs by the band so I really feared for this song\u2019s awesomeness in \u201cacoustic mode\u201d. But\u2026 They actually didn\u2019t ruin it. As the previous song, it has been cut down in length, not that much though. It is nice and calm, and originally it also had a ballad feel to it. I really applaud Saxon on those acoustic songs. It really shows the skills of the band that they can \u201ctransform\u201d some old tracks like that and not making them doll. It\u2019s like they have gotten and overdose of breath mints. Totally fucking fresh. Now I got two versions of one of my favourite Saxon songs. Perfect! I usually don\u2019t do track by track reviews but to me it just seemed like something good to do, for old and even new fans so you know about the quality of these new recordings. If you of course care about re-recordings, and if not\u2026 Oh well!\n\nFrom the core of the track-list, which means the ten new tracks, I would highlight Sacrifice, Made in Belfast, and Guardians of the Tomb. It is not much but they are the only tracks that really stand out, but if you want to make the three track span a little bigger then get the versions with the re-recordings of Requiem (We Will Remember), Frozen Rainbow, and Forever Free.\n\nInstead of dishing up with these albums within a 2-year span I think they should take some more time off to write better material. A real fucking smasher, which the band really need, to get some more success which they deserve. Personally, I prefer Saxon over Iron Maiden, but that is just me. Saxon have so many hidden gems, you just got to find them. But I really think they deserve a real breakthrough, it almost makes me sad that they are so under appreciated. So when reflecting, \u201cSacrifice\u201d doesn\u2019t really add anything new to the table that the band haven\u2019t already released. However, it was a nice surprise with the acoustic versions of some old songs, maybe they should incorporate acoustic songs more on their albums, because they really got a nose for it! It is not a bad album but not a great one either, just a decent performance, though some of the re-recordings really pulled this album up in rating.\n\nWritten for Reigning Damnation.\n",
        "\nThis is Saxon with no power. Think commercial hard rock and you're way closer than any heavy metal. There is a ton of synth backing to draw up images of bands that had guitars but didn't have any real riffs (or power behind the riffs if they did exist). It's all atmosphere and vocal hooks with chirpy guitar leads to make and break songs. Saxon are not known for pulling off good albums using this kind of formula, let alone making any more than one good song for most heavy metal listeners. However, somewhere in this mess of a '80s romance-drama album is something that can be likeable.\n\nThe cover song at the beginning should sum this up perfectly: softly-distorted guitars, thumping drumming, and a drabby bass all trying to support the leading vocals. Byford's singing is high and expansive, but the music around him is some real sappy stuff. That production only helps to make everything more docile and inoffensive, although I shouldn't complain since it's a good, clear job. Still, this music is geared toward hard rock / AOR / glam realms than any heavy metal. Strangely, the song that's the furthest in this territory, the love-ballad \"I Can't Wait Anymore,\" is my favorite off this mess of an album. It's so mushy, but I can't help but admire how well it sounds for what it wants to be. The loud punch of the drums and the jangly / clean guitars are adorable, and the atmosphere and gentle chorus are too easy on the ears to dismiss.\n\nAs much as the above is mostly out of my area, songs like \"Red Alert\" and \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" hark back to some kind of riffing akin to Thin Lizzy. Sadly, it sounds grossly out of place. Saxon submerged themselves too far into a soft rock territory for mediocre, ineffectual songs like those to have any place or purpose. Saxon wanted to be poppy, fluffy, and without any depth, and damn it they did it here. They can't then attempt to write half-assed heavy metal and sprinkle it sparsely.\n\nIn all honesty, just skip this. There's nothing here to be missed, despite whatever positives I could possibly attribute to it. It might not be heavy metal, but it's not very good, either. There are better bands that play this type of music, and Saxon do little to add with their own style.\n",
        "\nSaxon's Rock The Nations is like when you see aircraft doing an aerial show and in the middle of it, one of the jets just veers the fuck off course for no reason. It stumps everybody, much like how Saxon stumps me on this album. Looking at that cover, it's a letdown that barely half of this album lives up to such enormity. Instead, it's glammification (and then some) from a heavy metal band. The production isn't as perfected like the polished, loud job on Innocence Is No Excuse, so it sounds stripped and compacted in comparison. \n\nThrow this in the ballpark of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Shout At The Devil, which still has more balls than this. However, Saxon isn't without their strong-arm song containing a colossal chorus, hefty bass support, and dominant riffs. The anthemic, Maiden-esque \"Battle Cry\" is the start-to-finish song encompassing these traits and much more. Byford's distant wailing, the rolling drum patterns, and the charging pace keeps this one intense and upbeat without toying with cheesy melodies and upbeat jingles. The one problem that plagues this song and the rest of the album is how weak the guitars sound. It's that typical '80s sound where the guitars begin sounding like synthesizers, having no bite at all. It sometimes works, but on an album like this it needs to sound like something more pronounced.\n\nThe rest of the album doesn't reach this peak. It hovers below it with one or so of the above positive traits, like the title track's memorable chorus, the vigor of \"Running Hot\", or the poppy leads of \"Waiting For The Night\". Hell, even \"Northern Lady,\" Elton John's only useful contribution to the album, is ripe with addicting leads and a more melodious vocal performance. There are positives like these that keep the songs interesting, but don't contribute to the overall value to the album. Other songs go out of their way to butcher Saxon's reputation, like \"You Ain't No Angel\" trying to be Whitesnake with none of the zest or the worthless jazzy / piano-bar-type swing or whatever (it reminds me of Family Matters) of \"Party 'Til You Puke\". It creates for a hacky album with an already inconsistent flow.\n\nYou might as well skip this one and not even worry about it. \"Battle Cry\" is pretty cool, but it's nothing you can't miss from any of the bad Saxon albums that had songs like \"Crusader\" or \"The Eagle Has Landed\" on them. Rock The Nations feels like an underachievement, with the band not committing to one direction like on Innocence Is No Excuse. Even Destiny, while sucking hard, was able to be (mostly) consistent.\n",
        "\nThis is my favorite Saxon album of the early years. It's more commercial than the NWOBHM material and the in-between radio-friendly sound from the '80s / '90s, but that's the surface. For such a straightforward album, there's way more to enjoy than what's assumed. For what defines the 1980s, this is one of the albums that I think captures that resonance more than any other. Innocence... is (arena) rocking in formula and has a polished production job, but it's not without its heavy metal roots.\n\nWhat Saxon was getting killed on during this era was their inability to write memorable songs for an entire album (for many, going commercial was the bad move). They would always get a couple standouts, but then there's the rest of the album descending into mediocrity or below. It was a journey into glammy hard rock that didn't work... except here. The glossy production, with the guitars and their crystalline sustain, are better at capturing this sound than the clear-but-cutting distortion of the previous two albums. The bass' fat lines aren't any different, but the drums echo louder than ever. It's a vast sound that increases the scope and atmosphere, so nothing ever feels compacted. At the forefront, Byford's lines are not only more fine-tuned, but they're actually singing catchy choruses. Again, this points back to the problem of the immediate albums before and after - there wasn't any agreement nor commitment on writing anything catchy!\n\nFrom the cryptic opening of \"Rockin' Again\" to the cheerful \"Back On The Streets\" and to the spirited \"Everybody Up,\" this is like listening to a re-invigorated band. To keep consistency, energy, and memorability throughout the entire thing was something sorely missing for a couple albums. It's no more heavier, but everything feels more correct. Granted, the enjoyment starts to burn out near the end, but that's unimportant in the overall package.\n\nAbove even the above-average Saxon outcome that is this album, there are two standouts. \"Rockin' Again\" is the atmospheric, ballad-like intro which may seem odd for the start of the album. Nonetheless, it's heavy and unforgettable with a somber tone. The second, \"Broken Heroes,\" is probably my favorite Saxon song (it's another ballad). Now of all the gloomy, solemn songs this band wrote, this one is the best at capturing its themes without compromising the music. Byford's sullen delivery is exemplary, as well as the accompanying guitar leads that ring fervently with that clean distortion. Behind it all is Glockler's artillery-loud pounding, as well as the flabby bass gliding along with it. Such an intense song with an infectious chorus to match.\n\nTo my ears, this is the only great '80s Saxon album after their NWOBHM reign. For the next few years, the band would fall apart musically, losing sense of who they were until the '90s where they maintained the status quo before hitting their stride again. The heavy metal persona would be lost, as well as the energy needed to keep sounding fresh and invested. They kept getting weaker, eventually requiring a full revival to resurrect whatever was left after this failed attempt at hitting big commercially. This album did it right, however, and still stands as properly delving into a sound that is and isn't representative of the band and their capabilities.\n",
        "\nCrusader takes what Power & The Glory did and makes it a bit worse. The previous album's fault was starting and ending strong while having a very mediocre core. Its blend of heavy metal and hard rock didn't go over very well, making for a very inconsistent album. This album doesn't do it any different, except maybe spreading the crap out more. Therefore, what Saxon hands out is a strong opening song with a commercial (glammy) tracklist to follow. It's very apparent where the band wanted to go, but their writing leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nEven with a clearer production job, Saxon decided commercial hard rock with no depth outdid heavy metal that had passion. The Japanese band Bow Wow / Vow Wow were doing the same thing at the time, but even their music had authenticity to it. Saxon's commercial take-over with dull songs like \"Rock City\" and \"Just Let Me Rock\" (guess what's starting to get repetitive here) glossed with clean leads feels really outdated and forced. Oddly, other songs like \"Sailing To America\" and \"Run For Your Lives\" have actual atmosphere and high-ranged vocal lines that, despite their cheesiness, I can't help but enjoy. It's got no power behind it, but the strict enjoyment that's invigorating in some strange way. The leads, riffs, and vocals are all catchy (not a whole lot of substance, but whatever), but it's just not Saxon; there's always something off.\n\nSkipping over the great intro, there's \"A Little Bit Of What You Fancy\". When it started, it sounded like it bended into 8-bit hard rock for a split second. Even without that blunder, it's a song that defines what kind of album this is - plodding hard rock. Even with that cover art to keep up its misleading ways, it doesn't change the fact that this is rock for an '80s movie soundtrack. No bite, no anthems, no ripping riffs, no lasting impact, and no replay value. \n\nDespite all of these drawbacks, the one thing avoiding the above pitfalls is the title track. It's everything that this album was missing: epicness, supremacy, immensity, and Saxon where they truly belong. It's tacky, but cool in execution and dark in tone. Byford's Udo-like vocals sing well and high, particularly during the clenching chorus. It's still a rockier Saxon, with its weaker guitar distortion and controlled tempo, but that depth isn't lost. It's a song like that which demonstrates a band knowing full well what it wants to accomplish and doing it with all seriousness. Nothing is held back, making it a song that doesn't feel like it's obligated to accomplish something out of character. It's inconsistent with the rest of the album like hell (because it doesn't suck), but something good in a heap of bad can't be dismissed.\n",
        "\nCalling out what's first seen, that cover art sucks. It reminds me of the movie Beastmaster, but way more limpy. Beyond that, it's Saxon fiddling with heavy metal and hard rock. With this one, Saxon starts to move away from their rougher heavy metal beginnings. They create a weird mix of ass-kickery and inoffensive rock. It's a step in a commercial direction that splits the album's identity unevenly, with two really good songs and the rest skimming on the highs and lows of mediocrity. This can be called a bad album, but know what to expect and then realize that you'll probably get less than that. Still, it's mildly enjoyable for what's accomplished, and it's still Saxon playing with the fallout of the NWOBHM persona.\n\nThe two through-and-through heavy metal songs, \"Power & The Glory\" and \"The Eagle Has Landed\", rule the shit out of this album. They're both very different, very heavy, and very catchy songs that display the band's writing and translation in executing that writing to the fullest. The title track could easily be heard on the first Running Wild album. It's practically the same production job, with that cutting guitar distortion and blubbery bass rolling ahead of the clattering drums. Following the song's turbulent opening is the infectious chorus, both an anthemic direction and more epic than the rest of the album (except against the finale). The closer is a slow, doom-like pace tested by prog-influenced / spacey guitar leads. The rupturing riffs, plump bass lines, Byford's echoing singing, and the darker atmosphere ensures this album can never truly be discarded.\n\nWith that praise out of the way, what's left is an album with little going for it. There are licks, vocal lines, and riffs spread thin throughout that aren't disingenuous heavy metal / hard rock, but the sum of the parts (read: each song) can't stand on their own, unlike the two aforementioned tracks. It's more up-tempo than I would like, but even with that easy-to-manage hurdle, there's the cheesiness to confront. From the super corny lyrics (some of which are mind-numbingly repeated too often) to the just-as-corny riffs that accompany, these other songs in all their variedness aren't as enjoyable. They're average, dusted-off heavy metal / hard rock with no defining hooks. Byford's high-range (think Udo from Accept from around the same time) doesn't do more than take up space knowing that he has to perform vocals somehow, so that disconnect already hampers with the meandering writing.\n\nTake the title track and \"The Eagle Has Landed\" and skip this album. It's got these two awesome songs that sandwich the rest. From the banal music in between to the lame cover art, this is a Saxon album that shouldn't have been. The rest of these songs might be heavier than the commercial material to follow, but it's not anymore interesting. There's better representation for a band with such a large discography.\n",
        "\nSaxon never made it as far as Maiden, but they are still one of the well known bands from the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal. They released several excellent albums up to this one. On Crusader, Saxon forget that they are British heavy metal. Instead, they think that they're some mindless American glam metal band. On the UK charts, Saxon had been doing pretty well, so I suppose they must have decided to follow this success with success in America. Big mistake. Biff and co. looked at Def Leppard and went \"they come from the UK and they're massive in the States. If we make our sound like their's we 'll be massive, too.\" \n\nHowever, listening to the Crusader Prelude and the title track, they don't sound commercial. The drums have an echo and the guitars are a little weak, but it is still an awesome metal song singing about BRITISH history. Then we get...a load of crap. A Little Bit of What You Fancy has a whiny guitar tone and Biff shouting \"make me boogie!\". It's just embarrassing. The chorus is fluffy and the lyrics are silly. Sailing to America starts off with more whiny guitar and more reverb drums. Where have the British songs gone? And why are the band repeating quietly everything Biff sings in the chorus?\n\nThe Sweet cover is alright; the production is much better and the vocals aren't so wimpy, but it seems out of place. Saxon don't pick their covers very well. Just Let Me Rock is absolute glam shit. I skipped from the moment Biff goes \"just let me rock! Rock!\", but listening to it fully, I suppose the verses sound okay. The solo is just rubbish. I don't know what Saxon were thinking. Bad Boys (Like to Rock 'n' Roll) is even worse than the previous track. It's the opposite of its (embarrassing) title. The band do the same thing as on Sailing To America, echoing everything Biff says. There's another crap solo as well. Can this album get any worse?\n\nIt can. Do It All For You is like Suzie Hold On and Nightmare stuck together and is made more wimpy with a silly choir. This is another track you want to skip. Rock City I wanted to wipe off my cd. Stupid lyrics: \"Hi-fi, Sci-fi. Hear my words. We've been a long time coming. But we're here at last\". It's painfully commercial. Why isn't there a good track other than the title? Run For Your Lives is the best track on here aside from Crusader, but the song seems to be about him being drunk or on drugs and everything on fire? It's hard to work out.\n\n\nBest Track(s): Crusader\nWorst Track(s): Every other track.\n",
        "\nAbout a year ago, when I was getting into Saxon's music, I checked this site to see what are Saxon's best albums. After some not so good average scores for ''Solid Ball of Rock'', ''Forever Free'' and ''Dogs of War'', this album immediately intrigued me, since it was released in 1997, in very bad times for heavy metal, with average score of 87 percents. I read the reviews and said ''It's gotta be good, I'll pick this up''. \n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't disappointed, this site didn't let me down. Yes, ''Unleash the Beast'' is definitely one of the strongest and most important outputs in whole Saxon's career. When every other significant heavy metal acts were down at the bottom of their careers, Saxon found strength to actually resurrect themselves and bring new hope to the fallen genre. It was the turning point for Saxon, since after ''Unleash the Beast'' they drastically changed their sound and leaned towards more aggressive, edgy, German power metal-influenced music. Still, they kept their identity and this is 100% Saxon, no doubt about it, with trademark NWOBHM and occasionally hard rock riffing.\n\nOf course, the band performance and production are flawless. Thumbs up for the producer Kalle Trapp, who did an amazing job here, as every instrument is easy audible and gets the opportunity to shine. Also, the sound is very mystic and medieval, which combined with sinister and mostly pessimistic lyrics creates truly unusual, interesting and certainly awesome impression for the listener. Every band member puts up excellent performance as well, and I can't pick anyone in particular, since they all nailed it on their instruments. \n\nIt's hard to choose the highlights, since every song except for ''Absent Friends'' totally works for me on every department. From the speedy killer title track, majestic ''The Thin Red Line'', hard rock pieces ''Terminal Velocity'', ''The Preacher'' and ominous ''Bloodletter'', ''All Hell Breaking Loose'' and especially ''Cut Out the Disease'', which is I guess the most sinister song Saxon ever wrote, everything just fits together. I must point out two songs: ''Circle of Light'' and ''Ministry of Fools'', probably one of the most underrated Saxon songs ever. ''Circle of Light'' is a crushingly heavy song that deals with the famous ''walking to the light'', the moment between life and death. ''Ministry of Fools'', on the other hand, talks about incompetence and hypocrisy of politicians (probably thinking of Tony Blaire's government). Musically, it's a great slamming ballsy hard rock that won't leave you indifferent, and combined with great lyrics you have the winner! I must mention the title track as well, it's five minutes of pure headbanging speed metal lunacy. Nothing new for Saxon, you might say. True, but there's one thing that separates this song from every other generic speed metal - the outro. That eerie, ominous riff gives me goosebumps every time, it's so impressive and striking. It gives the song the final kick of genius and puts it deservedly among Saxon's top ten.\n\n''Unleash the Beast'' kept traditional metal alive. It was a wake-up call for old bands and encouraging light for new bands to join together and pull heavy metal out of darkness in which it fell in early and mid '90s. And they did it, since metal completely resurged at the beginning of new millenium. What about Saxon? Saxon continued pushing the boundaries, and there's no sign of slowing down. Heavy metal owes them a lot, just as much as every metalhead around the world. So, in the end, should you get this album? That's a silly question, isn't it...\n",
        "\nAfter four great albums, milestones that became symbols of NWOBHM era, Saxon were at the top of the world. The year is 1983, when metal was getting bigger and bigger, with genres and subgenres creating and developing. In that atmosphere, it would be great if Saxon sealed it all with another smasher, wouldn't it? Unfortunately, not only that they didn't create a masterpiece, they released ''Power & the Glory'', an album that will change their career for worse, and start a serie of hard/glam rock influenced albums in the '80s. All of them except for ''Innocence Is No Excuse'' were bland misfires and they are the main reason why Saxon today don't have the reputation of Metal Gods, along with Maiden, Priest, Sabbath etc. It's such a shame and injustice, but they're the only ones to be blamed...\n\nRemember ''Wheels of Steel'' or ''Strong Arm of the Law'' and pure metal attitude and passion that Saxon kicked you with every single song? Well, not much of that is to be found here. Instead, you have the weak car ridin' - girl bangin' ''Redline'', ''Nightmare'' - a sappy story of a guy who wants his girlfriend to be with him, cause he's having nightmares (the song is actually very good, but the lyrics are redundant), ''Watching the Sky'' - a boy who truly believes in aliens (like E.T. film, I guess), and ''The Eagle Has Landed'' - some cosmic psychedelic mumbo-jumbo (but it totally fits to the song, so I'll forgive them this). ''Warrior'' reminds a lot of Maiden\u2019s \u2019\u2019Invaders\u2019\u2019, it\u2019s weak as much as that song, and ''This Town Rocks'' is very good, but should be found only on live albums, certainly not on studio releases. UltraBoris had a very good point about this, read his opinion, I completely agree with him.\n\nAnother wrong move for Saxon is that starting with this album they slowly but shorely headed into hard rock/glam metal territory. This wouldn't bother me that much if they played strong and ballsy hard rock, but no. Thanks to the glam influence, they started making some really shitty and cheesy music. This would become more apparent on the following ''Crusader'', ''Rock the Nations'' and ''Destiny'' albums. I intentionally didn't mention ''Innocence Is No Excuse'', since that album is very good, unlike the aforementioned ones. Luckily, Saxon woke up in the '90s, and realised what they really are - the proper heavy fucking metal band.\n\nStill, this album has some truly astounding songs. That would be, of course, ''Power and the Glory'' - unbridled power, well deserved glory. Amazing song, with one of the most epic choruses and solos in Saxon's history (the only thing I can compare to it is Crusader); ''Midas Touch'' - great combination of ballad in verses and heaviness in chorus - this is a great little gem; and last but certainly not least ''The Eagle Has Landed''. I would call this the most unique song in Saxon's discography. There are a lot of reasons for this - first of all, the structure is very unusual, the song starts with some slow and atmospheric playing, and it lasts for about three minutes, when Biff starts singing. You can easily hear a lot of echoing, especially in the final verse lines, which combined with psychedelic lyrics really creates the feeling of a floating in the deep space. Great song, a bold experiment, it leaves the listener stunned and mesmerised. The Pink Floyd factor is crucial here. Wish that were more songs like this on this album.\n\nOverall, this is a very disappointing effort, and a beginning of very turbid times for Saxon. This bad score isn't only the consequence of the average music, but more important, this was also the sign that Saxon will never achieve the stellar status that, for example, Maiden has. As for the mainstream public and casual rock listeners, Saxon died out in the '80s. Not many of them are aware that in 1997, Saxon practically saved heavy metal with ''Unleash the Beast''. But who in the world cared for heavy metal then? Nobody, it seems...\n",
        "\nThey just can\u2019t stop. Fourteen years after their resurrection, \u2019\u2019Unleash the Beast\u2019\u2019, Saxon have not released a single album that isn\u2019t very good at least, and some of them are excellent (\u2019\u2019Unleash the Beast\u2019\u2019, \u2019\u2019Killing Ground\u2019\u2019, \u2019\u2019The Inner Sanctum\u2019\u2019). Truth to be said, none of those albums is a classic or a masterpiece in the range of \u2019\u2019Wheels of Steel\u2019\u2019 or \u2019\u2019Denim and Leather\u2019\u2019, but, fuck, after their late \u201980s misfires such as \u2019\u2019Rock the Nations\u2019\u2019 and \u2019\u2019Destiny\u2019\u2019, who\u2019d knew that Saxon will kick some major ass twenty years later? Saxon\u2019s story is one of the most unique in whole history of metal, since there are very few bands that didn\u2019t completely musically fall apart after several disastrous albums (e.g. Metallica), but instead, they found strength to keep on rocking and rolling. \n\nGood news that will certainly please their older fans, is that on this album Saxon is returning to their trademark NWOBHM, of course with modern (and truly excellent) sound. This is a continuation of tendency shown on the previous \u2019\u2019Into the Labyrinth\u2019\u2019, in opposite to almost power metal shown on \u2019\u2019Lionheart\u2019\u2019 and \u2019\u2019The Inner Sanctum\u2019\u2019. Everyone who was with Saxon back in \u201979 (pun intended) will be very pleased with these new songs: \u2019\u2019Back in \u201979\u2019\u2019, \u2019\u2019Surviving Against the Odds\u2019\u2019 (my personal favourite), \u2019\u2019Afterburner\u2019\u2019 and \u2019\u2019Ballad of the Working Man\u2019\u2019. All of them are good ol\u2019 NWOBHM tracks delivered with flame and passion typical for Saxon. Although all band members are in their fifties (Biff Byford is even 60 years old), they remained youngsters at heart, and they won\u2019t stop until their last breath.\n\nSure, there are some songs that represent modern Saxon, and that would be opener \u2019\u2019Hammer of the Gods\u2019\u2019, \u2019\u2019Mists of Avalon\u2019\u2019 and title track. The title track is one of the best songs Saxon wrote in last 20 years, truly magnificent and tragic. Thematically, it reminds a lot of Maiden\u2019s mind-blowing \u2019\u2019Paschendale\u2019\u2019 and it will certainly go among Saxon\u2019s best of one day. Unfortunately, there are also several forced and uninspired songs, such as \u2019\u2019When Doomsday Comes\u2019\u2019, \u2019\u2019No Rest for the Wicked\u2019\u2019 and totally unnecessary orchestral version of the title track, but in the end, they cannot ruin an impression that this is very strong release from a very old band. This is their nineteenth studio album, for God\u2019s sake. How many bands are there that sound this powerful, motivated and convincing on their nineteenth album? Not much, definitely.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about band performance and production; they\u2019re on par with previous releases, which means fantastic.\n\nI wasn\u2019t surprised with great quality of this album, since I didn\u2019t expect anything less from Saxon. It is a great ride that will please all Saxon fans, no matter how old they are, they\u2019ll enjoy this album. Their winning streak is continued, and Saxon have still much to say. They don\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone, they are playing for their enjoyment, and you can easily hear that. Long live Saxon and may they give us a lot of great music in the future!\n",
        "\nMy introduction to the Yorkshire Brit-metallers was through Power & the Glory and The Eagle Has Landed, so the bluesy, melodic rock sound was what I came to expect from Saxon (even during their infamous glam-metal days, they retained this characteristic)\u2026 right up until the point where I put on the widely-lauded Lionheart and immediately did a double-take. Was this the same band? As it turns out, it very much was. However, their sound on Lionheart, as on The Inner Sanctum was harder, cleaner, meaner, more power-metallic, more German (surely the inclusion of J\u00f6rg Michael on said album had nothing to do with that?). Imagine my surprise when I put on Call to Arms and discovered that, while not a total throwback, was at least enough of one to recall their early sound? My parents weren\u2019t even married when the first Saxon albums appeared, so naturally this isn\u2019t a nostalgic review for me \u2013 but I can easily imagine how it might be one for one of the fans who went to see them \u2018Back in \u201879\u2019!\n\nIt\u2019s immensely difficult for a band to keep going for over 30 years straight and still keep going strong, without descending into outright self-parody in terms of their musical style and content. Saxon comes damn close, with good old Biff bellowing about Viking invaders, airplanes, war (from the ambivalent and vulnerable perspective of the man on the front lines, naturally), ancient British history and mythology in a nearly paint-by-numbers fashion\u2026 but they perform it all with conviction, which I think keeps them from going straight over that ledge. \n\nThey have the Lionheart-style power metal opener, \u2018Hammer of the Gods\u2019; the slow, epic, elegiac title track, \u2018Call to Arms\u2019 (two versions, the latter having a largely cosmetic orchestral accompaniment); the obligatory speed-metal blazer \u2018Afterburner\u2019; several strong-but-not-particularly-memorable mid-tempo rockers (including the somewhat sentimental mythologising on \u2018Mists of Avalon\u2019), and then there are the songs which sound like they\u2019ve stepped through the Militia Guardian of Forever for a pure and shameless nostalgia trip. And I\u2019m not just talking about \u2018Back in \u201879\u2019, though that\u2019s enough in itself. There\u2019s \u2018Surviving Against the Odds\u2019, which is very much an upbeat NWoBHM number in the style of Denim and Leather, with even the underdog-championing lyrical content mirroring \u2018Never Surrender\u2019. There\u2019s \u2018Chasing the Bullet\u2019, which is pure blues-rock, however glorified and metallised \u2013 it comes with a lockstep \u2018this-is-how-you-will-headbang\u2019 drum line and predictable if well-executed guitar riffs, which likewise sounds like it would be perfectly at home on one of their early albums. And naturally, there\u2019s my favourite song on this album (given my lefty proclivities) \u2013 \u2018Ballad of the Working Man\u2019. As Biff sings, \u2018it\u2019s not so complicated\u2019; these guys are rocking with their collars out, and dude, they\u2019re bluer than the North Sea on a clear day. The musical style is a complete throwback, with a gumby blues-rock tempo, happy guitar lines, a simple song structure, and the lyrics are fit to match: \u2018no matter where you\u2019re going, remember where you\u2019ve been!\u2019\n\nTrue to his word, this album hearkens back to the high points of Saxon\u2019s career, proving that they are still capable of growing in their current direction while at the same paying due homage to what they\u2019ve already done. The musical style on Call to Arms is a successful synthesis of their old material into the new style they have inhabited over their three prior albums. Production is clear, mixing is alright (though the accompaniment on both versions of \u2018Call to Arms\u2019 sound overmixed to the point of collapsing in on itself, which is a shame\u2026 one would expect an over-the-top sympho-power band like Turisas to make that kind of choice, but on a Saxon album it sounds kind of out-of-place). All of the instrumentation is more than proficient; but, particularly at the edges of his range, Biff does sound a bit like age is catching up with him.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Saxon continues to be one of my favourite bands, in spite of their glammy / hard-rock middle years, and this album pretty much exemplifies it. They\u2019re pretty much straight-up rockers; they put on no frilly progressive pretenses, but they also sing about serious matters. They\u2019ve shown an amazing adaptability over the years, thus showing that the underdogs do, in fact, sometimes end up on top.\n\nMakes me right proud of me Cooper side Yorkshire roots, it does.\n\n17 / 20\n",
        "\nIf you had told me 20 years ago that Saxon would still be alive and well in the 21st century, releasing viable and even extraordinary albums, I doubt I would have believed you. Apart from Mot\u00f6rhead, they are perhaps the one long-term NWOBHM act who not only persist, but actively challenge themselves and come out fighting with records arguably as strong as their classics. Whilst Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are pushing up daisies, sating their audiences on brand names alone and diminishing songwriting capacity, Biff Byford and his troops have forged on with great records like Unleash the Beast, The Inner Sanctum, Lionheart and Into the Labyrinth.\n\nGranted, some purists who fancy only the most blue-collar roots of the band on classics like \"Wheels of Steel\" or \"Power and the Glory\" might feel turned off at the modern studio climate and surges of power metal aggression the band espouse in recent years, but a little variation does nothing to dull the band's inspirational, incessant devotion to quality. Call to Arms, their 19th full-length, delivers on all fronts, a blend of classic NWOBHM/hard rock tracks and faster paced material for the younger audience. \"Hammer of the Gods\", \"Afterburner\" and \"Surviving the Odds\" all offer the savage nigh-on speed metal that dwells upon their threshold of aggression, replete with soaring choruses, Byford stretching his elder lungs to the max.\n\nMeanwhile, those interested in the band's 80s, power ballad-to-balls fare will be thrilled with \"Mists of Avalon\" and \"No Rest for the Wicked\" which hearken back to Rock the Nations, Destiny and other examples of their work in the genre's Golden decade; and if it's the more 'epic' Saxon you seek (circa Metalhead, Into the Labyrinth, Killing Ground) then you've got \"When Doomsday Comes\". There are few if any missteps. \"Ballad of the Working Man\" has a decent swagger and melody line to it, but otherwise moves to the rear of the pack; while the big rock of \"Back in 79\", in which the band recruited a pile of fans to provide the later backing chorus, is not that great a tune outside of its cute gimmick...\n\nThe production sounds superb as it has for the past seven records, and the streak of memorable songwriting continues, even if the album isn't wholly consistent. Saxon proudly joins the ranks of Accept and Anvil in bringing the inspiration to yet another decade, this one ridden with old school heavy metal wannabes that are being proven redundant by the originators! Call to Arms is not the monolith of quality that Unleash the Beast and The Inner Sanctum both proved to be, but it thrusts a wrench to the jawbone of irrelevancy, and time itself is going to have to work a lot harder to steer these old dogs off the scent.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSaxon has been well noted for their historical inconsistency of style, along with a majority of their NWOBHM cohorts. Like many of the movements that grew out of it and likewise went awry, the principle culprit was gravitating towards whatever was selling or what was simply new at the time. But every now and then this phenomenon can yield strong results, such as the joining of many older 80s bands with the newer power metal scene that sought to remember some of the older ways and fuse them with a heavier, somewhat more modern presentation. Saxon\u2019s output in the 2000s have, to a large extent, mirrored this while also seeking to remember its early 80s roots.\n\n\u201cInto The Labyrinth\u201d is sort of an oddball in the recent Saxon output in that it obsesses itself pretty heavily with older bluesy rock ideas and makes only a few occasions into a grandiose, epic character in keeping with recent practices. A single listen to \u201cLive To Rock\u201d and \u201cSlow Lane Blues\u201d will bring back images of those slower Accept songs where Udo was sounding dangerously similar to Bon Scott, but the riffs were just a tiny bit too heavy for AC/DC. The guitars don\u2019t quite have as much crunch and Byford\u2019s vocals are even less gritty, though somehow even closer to Bon than Udo was, but this can\u2019t help but sound heavily like a combination of a couple of 80s rock bands intermingling with British/German early metal. \u201cVoice\u201d and \u201cProtect Yourselves\u201d veer a little bit heavier, but largely paint a similar picture, albeit less catchy.\n\nThis album is really at its zenith when it goes into that large sounding, heaven seeking epic character that they picked up from Freedom Call a while back. Ironically enough, the best song on here is the first one in \u201cBattalions Of Steel\u201d, which piles on the epic, Manowar inspired atmosphere, nails the ears with an unforgettable set of melodic hooks, and never hits a slump in its 6 \u00bd minute duration. The runners up follow fairly closely behind in \u201cDemon Sweeny Todd\u201d with all the speed and metallic riffing one can handle, and the dense, driving epic \u201cValley Of The Kings\u201d which brings back that Freedom Call atmosphere yet again. Few would assert that 3 songs could make an album, but in this particular case, it\u2019s about as close to that obvious improbability as one can get to.\n\nFor a band that has been blowing up speakers for well over 30 years, this is a band that doesn\u2019t know the meaning of the word retirement. It is perhaps a little stylistically inconsistent, but definitely a consistently good listen regardless of what influences it seems to be channeling at any one given song. This is something that might not be able to match wits with \u201cStrong Arm Of The Law\u201d or any of the other early classics that were contributed to the early 80s under the Saxon name, but it is definitely a solid album and a nice shelf stuffer for anyone still enthralled with classic early 80s NWOBHM with a side fixation for power metal.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on January 28, 2011.\n",
        "\nDo these towns know how to rock? \n\nThis live album was put together different from Saxon live albums of the past, from what the liner notes say. They started recording it at the world-famous Wacken festival in 2004, and didn't stop until 2 tours later. With the previous Eagle Has Landed albums, you got one live concert album each. Here, Saxon explains you're getting a live tour album instead. They wanted to create a live album of songs that haven't appeared on any of the other live albums. This includes material released after those live albums, and material that just didn't make their respective cuts at the time. What sets this live album apart is that this is for the hardcore Saxon fan. You don't get the Denim and Leathers, or the Heavy Metal Thunders, or the Princess of the Nights or the 747s. You get the underrated, unheralded deep cuts from one of metal's most legendary bands that you normally don't hear them play often. Included are a few tracks from the very under appreciated Power and the Glory album (Redline, Warrior, This Town Rocks). They even play several tracks from their debut album, which I don't believe they have hardly ever played (correct me if I'm wrong).\n\nFirst and foremost, this album probably has my favorite presentation of all time. You get a wonderfully simple gatefold digi-pack (I've never understood the disdain digi-packs seem to get) with one CD on each side, and a fantastic picture booklet in the center sleeve that contains a whopping 95 live pictures of the guys doing what the guys do best. Playing metal live!\n\nSo how the hell are the performances? It's Saxon, people! They're better live than they are in the studio. Even 27 years after their first album they still manage to get everything perfect. Biff's voice is in top shape, as always. If you're a die-hard Saxon fan, you know what you're getting with Biff. The same goes for Paul Quinn as well. Each note flows one after another in the exact fashion that the studio albums portrayed. The drumming was done by 3 separate guys on here (I can't imagine having 3 different drummers in 2 years), but all of the performances are consistent with each other. Saxon's obviously not going to hire some hack to fill such legendary shoes. While the songs from certain early albums do sound a bit more mild (Frozen Rainbow) and restrained (Suzie Hold On) than the rest of the pack, the raw live atmosphere breathes energetic life into each track.\n\nThe first disc is composed of all the lesser known classic 80s material the band, and the second focuses on everything from 1991 0nwards. Really, only a band like Saxon can pull off a double live album. The majority of bands don't have nearly enough classic (or even good, honestly) material to take up two and a half hours. Saxon's so fucking classic, they can fill up a two and a half hour running time, and still not even hit their most well-known classics! If only the collective NWOBHM movement had remained as strong as Saxon throughout the years...\n\nIf you've already got the first two Eagle Has Landed albums, you better get this one too! If you don't have those, get those first. Like I mentioned earlier, this album is strictly for all the die-hard Saxon fans in the world. If you're not in love with Saxon yet, you'd be better off going for the first two Eagle Has Landed albums. They'll give you a picture of what Saxon is about, and what Saxon has accomplished. This is just the album that helps the mega fans get more of what they crave!\n\nOh and yeah, these towns know how to fuckin' rock!\n",
        "\nWow, this sucks! I wish I could end this review there, but unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t pass as legitimate criticism, and so I have to endure this musical raping of my ears for just a while longer. I mean, good grief, this\u2026is terrible, in every sense of the word. It\u2019s Saxon, for fuck\u2019s sake! Goddammit, guys, you\u2019re supposed to be writing heavy metal anthems for the ages! What am I supposed to gain from an album of bullshit that makes Europe\u2019s \u201cThe Final Countdown\u201d look manly?\n\nOkay, alright, I know they were never exactly Manilla Road in terms of uncompromising metalness. There are plenty of times when they released acceptable material that was still really catchy and streamlined, but this\u2026this is just bad. Geez, this is really lame. Even the song titles don\u2019t sound good \u2013 they exude boredom even without hearing a note of the music. But I don\u2019t suppose this really constitutes a whole review, either, so let\u2019s just get to the bottom of this enervated, testosterone-starved mess that the band decided to call Destiny\u2026be afraid.\n\nThis is pretty much what would happen if you took everything good about Saxon, removed it, and replaced the band with aliens playing bad 80s pop music. I just cannot find this charming at all, and I know that was the aim with this, as everything tries SO DAMN HARD to charm and dazzle the listener, and fails every time. Everything about this is painful, from the dreary haze of the cream-puff synthesizers to the plodding riffs to Biff Byford\u2019s vocal performance, which is the most crystal clear I\u2019ve ever heard him, but also with the worst, most glammed up, commercialized vocal lines I\u2019ve ever heard him sing, too. The \u201catmosphere\u201d on here ranges from the startlingly bland evocation of a bad 80s movie where a hapless, clumsy lead actor tries to win back an equally shallow, poorly written love interest (\u201cSong for Emma\u201d) to a neon-spandex workout video, as in the horrifying \u201cSOS.\u201d\n\nThis album is light on the ears, but it\u2019s so light and so full of sugary non-substance that it will make you want to throw up. It is cringe-inducingly lazy \u2013 what, so you can\u2019t write even one song without that poppy fuzz and bounce behind it? You can\u2019t even try to conjure up a feeling with the vocals or the guitars without trying to let the synths do it for you? This is just so fucking enervated. It\u2019s like every stereotype about pop music in the 80s realized in the form of a good metal band writing unbearable horse diarrhea.\n\n\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I just have nothing else to say about this except obscenities of various kinds. This album just sucks so much in every way that this is really the only response it elicits and the only one it deserves. I can\u2019t honestly fault opener \u201cRide Like the Wind\u201d much, as it is a cover, and it would have been tolerable if the rest of the album had improved upon it rather than just regurgitating the bad ideas in it. The rhythm is passable and the riff is okay, and the vocals aren\u2019t bad \u2013 but even at four minutes it feels too long, like the ideas in it were played out long before the band stopped playing. Fact is, these songs just aren\u2019t well written enough to even sustain them for an average three to four minute time-frame. The lack of ideas is just astonishing, even when the band comes up with a chorus that isn\u2019t transparent bullshit, or a nice riff. \u201cWhere the Lightning Strikes\u201d is the same, with another average riff and another pretty okay vocal performance from Biff, but as soon as it hits that out-of-nowhere section at about 2:45 you know the song has run out of ideas. Lame. It\u2019s only a four and a half minute song, guys, not some kind of titanic epic.\n\nIn fact, a lot of the stuff on here is pretty much exactly like that. You get some half-cocked arena fluff with \u201cSOS,\u201d which is one of the lamest things I\u2019ve ever heard out of a respectable band like this, and some half-assed \u201crockers\u201d like \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls.\u201d And \u201cSong for Emma\u201d\u2026when the Scorpions do this kind of song, it\u2019s cool. Somehow, by some freak accident of nature, this song just kind of sucks. It does cook up some heaviness eventually, but still\u2026it just never really clicks. \u201cWe Are Strong\u201d is more shitty, fruity spandex-rock, and have you noticed that all of these choruses sound the same? Good grief, it\u2019s like the album is just one long song; it\u2019s just painful. I am dead serious; pretty much all of these choruses are sung with the same timbre, the same layers on them, the same everything.\n\nBut wait! We haven\u2019t touched on the album\u2019s crown jewel of terribleness, \u201cI Can\u2019t Wait Anymore.\u201d Yes, the album\u2019s most shameless pop sell-out yet, with all the balls of a eunuch in spring and all the energy of a corpse on the side of the road in the gutter \u2013 and just about as much integrity, at that. When I see the video for this song, watching Biff Byford on a stage of neon pink and silver, crooning like a pop star he never was and was never meant to be\u2026I die on the inside. A part of my soul just withers and dies.\n\nUgh, fuck it, I\u2019m done. This is just horrible. Fuck, I\u2019d rather listen to Savage Amusement - that\u2019s how low we\u2019ve gotten, people. No thought, no power, no nothing except for syrupy clich\u00e9 and smarmy annoyance. Every band has one bad album or so, and it turns out that Saxon\u2019s was one of the worst. There are a few moments here that aren\u2019t terrible, and I\u2019ve heard worse music overall, but Destiny is still about as big of a waste of time as they come. The music is played well enough, but this is just so\u2026lame! To add insult to injury, the band finally puts a real song that isn\u2019t a pile of sleazy crap at the end with \u201cLive Fast Die Young,\u201d which has good, driving riffs, a strong vocal performance and a lack of synths altogether, making for an enjoyable listen all around. The differences are minute, but it\u2019s the details that matter.\n\nJust listen to that song ten times, and you\u2019ll have a more rewarding experience.\n",
        "\nI've made it a point since my youth to purchase every Saxon album as it was released, since they've always held some quality I find endearing, and are one of my favorite NWOBHM bands, probably the most enduring over their entire career. The 90s kicked off with Solid Ball of Rock and Forever Free, which were alright, but did not have the lasting impact of some of their earlier material.\n\nAnd lo, while its predecessor Dogs of War had a few decent tracks on it, I was not expecting much out of Unleash the Beast, and thus was entirely blown away when I first sat down to listen to it. Up to 1997, this is by far the heaviest effort Saxon had produced, and every fucking song is memorable. I will go even so far as to say it's the best album they wrote in the first two decades of their career, just edging out the accessible (and oft-rued) Destiny. It's important not only because it brought Saxon's style into the era of modern production values, but added an extra level of aggression that would help fuel the band's excellent future catalog (Metalhead, Lionheart, and the band's opus magnum The Inner Sanctum). It was as if Saxon had broken out of a slump and realized they were one of the last true torchbearers left to this style. For example, compare Unleash the Beast to ANYTHING Iron Maiden has released since Somewhere in Time, or ANYTHING Judas Priest has done since Painkiller. There is just no fucking comparison. Saxon wins. Long live Saxon!\n\n\"Gothic Dreams\" is a fine intro to the record, with swelling synthesizer/choirs that part curtains for the rumbling steel of the title track. Once that speed metal verse rhythm comes in, you know that Saxon has been putting in long hours to make this album fantastic. Biff's vocals were the best they had yet been, every line carefully composed and delivered through his veteran throat. His mid range is excellent, but he can also shriek when he deems it necessary. The four chord chorus is dripping with Nibbs' saucy basslines and even the fucking guitar solos burn with a fire this band had quelled for too long. If you cannot raise your fist in the front row and bang it along to the sky diving \"Terminal Velocity\", you are NOT metal and do not belong here!\n\n\"Circle of Light\" maintains the band's hammer gait, a dark track with a gorgeous payoff. Again, the band has successfully taken their roots approach to blue collar NWOBHM and bathed it in something above and beyond the call of duty. \"The Thin Red Line\" could have been on the Top Gun soundtrack and kicked everything else there in the arse. Perfect for truckin' and fighting'! \"Ministry of Fools\" takes a toss at Maiden-style melodic riffing, eventually coming one of the most dear tracks on the album (as if you could choose favorites, really). The chorus to this song is just incredible hard rock bliss:\n\n'We're not listening, listening to you\nWe're not listening, don't tell me what to do\nWe're not listening, listening to you\nWe're not listening to the ministry of fools'\n\n\"The Preacher\" takes another jab at authoritarian impostors, and \"Bloodletter\" makes for a nice successor to a classic like \"Wheels of Steel\". \"Cut Out the Disease\" is probably the most heavy goddamn songs Saxon has ever composed, and the darkest on this record, with some atmospheric synthesizers behind the intense string hammering, not to mention the colossal crunch of its verse rhythms. \"Absent Friends\" is a bluesy rock ballad, and while it lost this album 1/2 a point, Biff still sounds great singing it. \"All Hell Breaking Loose\" picks the pace back up to close the album; strangely the tune reminds me of Running Wild.\n\nYeah, so...Unleash the Beast. If you couldn't already tell, I'm rather fond of it. If you're into this sort of thing, you know, quality heavy metal music, and you've made the grave life mistake of missing out, you should probably be heading out to the store about now, or clicking on your little iTunes icon.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\n#38 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nSaxon\u2019s commercially ambitious, and direction changing \u2018Crusader\u2019 album is frequently panned by metalhead critics, who were disappointed in said change of tack, and felt the album lacked only a handful of salvageable numbers. Though this type of met(l)morhosis is usually disappointing, and leads bands to make shitty AOR, that they should leave to the masters of the art form like Night Ranger, in some cases these bands can actually end up crafting good music in this vein. Disappointment aside, Saxon prove themselves capable of producing some strong efforts in this vein (see: \u2018Hold On\u2019 for example) so it\u2019s not all bad news. However, \u2018Do it all for You\u2019 can\u2019t really be considered amazing AOR or melodic heavy metal. It\u2019s not totally unsalvageable, but is a wee-bit tired in lyrics and subject matter.\n\nThis title track showcases Biff\u2019s classic vocal abilities fairly well, with his alternating between rough hollering, and soft, melodic deliveries ,even within the first verse. The backup choir effect is quite nice too, adding a pop flavour in the 70\u2019s rock vein. Verses are fairly boring though, in spite of Biff\u2019s strong deliver, and the song feels a bit repetitive. It\u2019s absolutely listenable, as Saxon is a band with talent that can set their mind to almost any task, but this simply isn\u2019t their best ballad (See \u2018Iron Wheels\u2019 for an example). While Saxon proved themselves able to write some good, more commercially orientated material, it was a disappointment for many fans to see them change direction in this way, particularly when you look at all-out aggressive albums like \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019. \n\n\u2018Just Let me Rock\u2019 is a better number, that I believe a video was made for at the time. Biff\u2019s verse vocals are soft, but very strong, and clear in the mix. Though this one is incredibly hook heavy, and will induce head bangin, not to mention having that classic Saxon rebelliousness, and working class free-spirited feel, it is after all another one of those \u2018Rock Anthem\u2019 type songs, which are fairly tired, even by this date, and many people don\u2019t seem to enjoy. I like it though, mostly due to it\u2019s allegiance to their classic sound, and it\u2019s rebellious spirit, which is again part of their classic formula and heritage. A better number than the a-side, and one of the cooler songs from the full-length. Not a horrible release, but a bit weaker than much of their material.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\n#37 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nSaxon\u2019s follow up to the 1992 album was awesomely album-arted 1995 offering 1995 album \u2018Dogs of War\u2019 during a time of considerable decline in metal, and a slowing down period in touring and production, for the band. It was also a time of considerable lineup troubles with the band, featuring a different bassist from their earlier work, and being the last album with awesome classic Saxon guitarist Graham Oliver, whose partnered style with Quinn defined much of the early Saxon sound. Here Saxon takes a slight change in direction, as it is somewhat of a departure from the 1992 offering, with different guitar tone, and some slight changes in riffage, while still staying true to their classic, no-bullshit, hard rockin, working class roots. \n\nThe \u2018Dogs of War\u2019 featured two decent, but not minblowing cuts, from what is essentially another strong album from Saxon. It\u2019s a considerably tougher album than \u2018Destiny\u2019 for example, with a heavier guitar mix, and more pounding, in-your-face drums from Nigel Glockner. \u2018Dogs of War\u2019 though good, is not as brilliant and anthemic as \u2018Burning Wheels\u2019 from the same album, but it does cover cool subject matter. The heavy, lowtuned guitars on this album are at the forefront of the mix, which would be a style set with these tracks, that would continue into the 2000\u2019s. I don\u2019t really find the verses in this track two enthralling however, as the riffs aren\u2019t really \u2018riff\u2019s\u2019 as much as they could be, and the vocal phrasing isn\u2019t too exciting. Biff delivery is quiet, and soft \u2013 not hollered and shouted at you, like he does so well in much of their material. This downside is replaced by the very cool guitar lead section though, which really shines through with the big, modern production job. A different style of guitar is certainly on display in this track marking a change in the Saxon sound, and the chorus has a decent, singalong hook which is pretty enjoyable.\n\n\u2018Hold On\u2019 is a bombastic melodic hard rock style pop song that draws closer to their late 80\u2019s slightly \u2018glam\u2019 days. Though the guitars are mixed in pretty heavy (not as heavy as the a-side), some of the licks, and the utterly simplistic guitar notes (as opposed to chords) during the chorus are very typically AOR (late 80\u2019s/early 90s) like stuff Fate, or Autograph would do. Lyrcis too. Anyway, the point I want to make about this pop song, is that it rules. The guitar leads are very rockin, almost reminding me of Slash\u2019s style with Guns \u2018N Roses, while the overall feel of the song is another example of how Saxon can not only write dirty, rebellios speed metallish NWOBHM, but also bombastic, enthralling more poppy commercial stuff \u2013 that kicks the ass of 90% of the bands who were attempting it as a full-time, and commercial endeavor in the late 80\u2019s. Saxon does both well, and more lately, they\u2019ve added a power metal string to their bow. Not their best single, or their best album, but yet again, damn strong, and very catchy.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\n#36 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nSaxon\u2019s 2004 \u2018Lionheart\u2019 full length was a critically acclaimed album that proved the band still had it after 30 proud years of what a lot of people seem to refer to as \u201ctrue metal\u201d. Though the consistency of albums, and some slightly AORish moments had been a little rocky at times, Saxon was still producing largely high-grade shit that could still banish foes, though not quite as relentlessly as during their phylum of early-mid 80s dominators. Even their generally regarded \u201cweaker\u201d albums contained some solid offerings; for example \u2018Forever Free\u2019 and \u2018Solid Ball of Rock\u2019. But now it was the 2000\u2019s and the recent wave of classic heavy metal resurgence seems to have given impetus and motivation to these proud British stalwarts, compelling them to come up with what is arguably their best offering in years. Just the one official single was pressed for promotion of the album, and while I think they personally should have gone for \u2018Witchfinder General\u2019 or the title track, this is a strong number in it\u2019s own right, and shows an ever so slightly tempered Saxon who is back to declare heavy metal will live forever.\n\nUpon hearing this, people may be excused for thinking that Saxon had slowed things down in their fourth decade, as it\u2019s not nearly as fast and aggressive as other tracks from the full-length such as \u2018Live by the Sword\u2019, but in any case it\u2019s good. The slow, clean channeled guitars in the intro are almost misguiding, as they are shortly replaced with what is a very modern-toned, downtuned guitar performing very, heavy and crunching riffage, which differs from their classic guitar sound. Anyway, the phrasing of the guitar and its mating to Biff\u2019s powerful, whining loud bellows in the verses still harks back to classic Saxon somewhat, with their well-known and respected ability to perform excellent, locked in rhythms. The chorus in this one is quite powerful; simple yes, but actually quite catchy, with a slow pace and easily to decipher lyrics, which serve as a decent, though not amazing hook. Albeit, the tough riffs and strong vocal performance, with crashing drums, yet with a very modern production job which sets it apart from their classic material (even the late 80s/early 90s stuff), seem to make a statement that says (in Biffs voice) \u201cWe\u2019re here to stay, mother fuckers!\u201d\n\nThe simple chorus hook makes it serve decently as a single, but I would have preferred one of the other tracks which made it to the lineup. In addition, none of these other tracks are present as the b-side, instead a (quite different) version of the same track, which though I always enjoy hearing different versions of the same track, could have included a b-side track from the sessions that didn\u2019t make it on to the album (if there were any), or possibly the cool instrumental \u2018Jack Tars\u2019. In any case, a different song that showcases Saxon\u2019s new (though not too much of a departure!) style, and proves they still know how to rock. Not their best single, or the best track on the album, but still rocks hard.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\n#35 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nThis great little single, available in several versions features as the title cut \u2018And the Bands Played On\u2019, a fan favourite (and one of my early obsessions) that has become a frequent part of their live set for 30 years! In the true Saxon tradition, this cut is a rebellious number, about living the heavy metal lifestyle and sounds tough, and damn convictive. When Saxon writes a song about rockin\u2019 out, they damn well mean it, and it\u2019s far better than even the respectable Twisted Sister\u2019s tracks dealing with this theme. In fact, ill go so far as to say Saxon writes some of the most badass tracks about rockin out. \u2018Hungry Years\u2019 is a gritty, though more straightforward rocker that would go on to feature on \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 (in two versions if you get the expanded re-release). Another strong churn-out here from Saxon, and very collectable.\n\nThe title track couldn\u2019t kick any more asses if it tried. The cool scaley main riff will burn itself into your brain, and is heavily conducive to drunken air-guitar. This scaley riff naturally builds into the exceptional guitar lead section, which is passionate and really pushes through the subject matter. The classic lineup of Paul Quinn & Graham Oliver on Guitar here produces a stunning series of harmonies, and switch overs, with that cool locked in feel on rhythms, which is seldom paralleled by any in NWOBHM, but a central part of the powerful Saxon sound. This cool rhythmic feel is helped along by the capable bass skills of Dawson, and the crashing, thundering skin-pounding of one Pete Gill, who featured on some of their greatest works. The subject matter here is familiar, but here is handled in a different way. While Blind Fury wrote similar stuff about Masters of Metal, this was a couple of years later, and handled it completely differently. As did Handsome Beasts with their cut \u2018One of the Crowd\u2019. The Saxon track is the standout of the bunch, and the one that has stood the test of time. A solid 30 year fan favourite for a reason \u2013 it rocks incredibly hard.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\n#35 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nSaxon\u2019s \u2018Forever Free\u2019 full-length was probably the most lacking full-length I had heard to that point, yet ironically was actually still a passable, and gutsy offering. One of the highlights of said album was the awesome \u2018Forever Free\u2019 an song which manages to mix Saxons slower, reflective semi-balladry almost AOR style, with it\u2019s early, groundbreaking, working class aggression. Here they didn\u2019t opt to use this as the promotional single for the album (this time there was only the one single put on offer by Virgin Records but times had changed), instead choosing the metal term-laden \u2018Iron Wheels\u2019, a high point in the album, but doesn\u2019t have the awesome rebellious spirit of the b-side. Anyway, a nice little single here, from what was arguably the darkest time for Saxon, and really the end for metal as a whole, for some time. As I mentioned in my review for the full-length, here Saxon is able to produce no-nonsense proud heavy metal even up against the odds, in metal\u2019s darkest hour. Commendations.\n\n\u2018Iron Wheels\u2019 is the albums passionate ballad, but rather than being about love lost, or youthful summers, this is an historic, British pride anthem, the likes of which you can only expect from Iron Maiden (\u2018Clansman\u2019), Bruce Dickinson (\u2018Let it Rain\u2019) or of course, the mighty Saxon. From what I can tell, this song is not only an ode to better times, and a reflection of past glory, but also a poem of the sands of time, and mortality. Biff delivers in a solemn tone about mortality, growing old, past glory and despair, and lyrics of Britain\u2019s mining and industrial past, which really grab you by the heart. Definitely a strong point of the album, and a great ballad, but not really a pop ballad. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what Branson\u2019s Virgin was after though, but in 1992, Bon Jovi, GNR and Badlands were about the only forms of acceptable \u2018heavy metal\u2019 music that was still getting airtime, so possibly they were. Either way, Saxon stuck to their guns and produced an excellent effort in the ballad tradition. \n\n\u2018Forever Free\u2019 is a killer track that I feel should have made it into their regular live set. This ones got it all; it manages to retain some awesome, classic-Saxon sounding riffage (e.g \u2018Heavy Metal Thunder\u2019 or \u2018747\u2019) and the badass, no-bullshit rebellious attitude as if to say, it might be 1992, but don\u2019t fuck with the Saxon!!!! Biff\u2019s reverbed hollers just ppond that meaning into, in this song about cruising the highway on your bike, and taking no shit from nobody. Utterly classic Saxon! Good solos, and a thick, massive production job on this track manage to carry it through \u2013 and it\u2019s an instant classic that will get its hooks in you. With these two solid tracks, why the fuck were people proclaiming Saxon had lost it at this time? Filler on the album aside, these are two strong offerings, easily deserving of moving a few hundred thousand copies of the album worldwide. This was a tough time for real metal, and one where we didn\u2019t even know if we would wake up and metal would have disappeared \u2013 it certainly got close. These days we all know that heavy metal will never die, but it was different time back then \u2013 a fickle market had begun to turn its back on heavy metal, and it may have seemed like it would go for good. Thank fuck for bands like Saxon who refused to lay down and die, and remained \u2018Forever Free.\u2019\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nSaxons \u2018Power and Glory\u2019 full-length is appreciated, but not generally praised nearly as much as WOS, or D&L, and this is something I struggle to understand. This album is pretty much as aggressive, rebellious and kickass as all their earlier works, and more so than \u2018Crusader\u2019 perhaps. The whole full-length pretty much dominates, as my review for \u2018Nightmare\u2019 alludes to. This time round however, it is the turn of \u2018Power and Glory\u2019 \u2013 a stunning track which inevitably became a single, and easily secured itself as a regular slot in the live set of thousands of concert dates over the next quarter century. This song is truly brilliant and utterly anthemic, and comes in two versions, including a 12\u201d with two added live tracks. A cool offering, particularly in the 12\u201d version, where you not only get the standout stunner from the album, but also two bonus live classics, which aren\u2019t just stolen directly from the full-length \u2013 thereby shortchanging buyers of either. Kickass NWOBHM in all it\u2019s \u2018GLORY\u2019.\n\nThis track has got it all. The relentless passionate main riff, which is very well done, races along while Biff just hollers raw, convictive anthemism right in your face. By the time the solo section erupts, you\u2019re basically at the heavy metal equivalent of an orgasm. The production job on this album is very noticeable; Saxon started to use far more complex, technical production with this album, and it\u2019s perhaps most noticeable here, with all kinds of effects going on. Though heavy in production it still sounds about as metal as possible, and minblowingly aggressive. Biffs double/triple tracked backup vocal harmonies in the oft repeated chorus are great, and just urge sing along, and fists in the air headbanging. This is such a complex, big studio style production, that at times the drum and guitar sound is reminiscent of Judas Priest too. Either way, this is one of the finest Saxon songs ever made, and one of NWOBHMs finest hours \u2013 I see no way in which you could hear it and not be totally hooked and become a rabid fanboy. \n\nBrilliant title track with the added advantage of two solid live anthems. Performance wise they aren\u2019t mindblowing or exceptionally recorded, but strong and badass. This album deserves a bit more respect, and it\u2019s got something to do with how awesome this complex, shreddingly delicious track is. I\u2019d hate to have to follow these guys on stage at this time (or any time for that matter) when they were churning out such fantastic, fast paced NWOBHM domination. Utterly recommended, legendary NWOBHM, and possibly the best single for the \u2018Power and Glory\u2019 full-length, which I believe spawned three.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\n#33 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nThe \u2018Power and the Glory\u2019/ \u2018Crusader\u2019 period isn\u2019t a popular one from Saxon. After the rough and ready speed metal anthemism of their \u2018Wheels of Steel\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 period, Saxon did take somewhat of a change of course; no longer attempting rough and raw bangers, they tried to capitalize on their new found popularity, by injecting a more melodic, commercially tinged sound, crafting some rather saccharin melodic numbers that disappointed a few metalheads at the time. Fact is though, these albums and tracks are still great \u2013 they\u2019re just often not as hard as their harder efforts; of course they\u2019re not \u2013 how could every song be like \u2018Heavy Metal Thunder\u2019? Anyway, though melodic, \u2018Power and the Glory\u2019 isn\u2019t their most poppy effort, it does have some softer moments. \u2018Nightmare\u2019 is a catchy, hook laden single that I\u2019ve always enjoyed. They produced a video for it, which is available on one of their video hits compilations (recommended), though the clip for this one is a wee bit lame, the song is actually pretty cool, and showcases the knack the guys have for making good commercial pop songs as well as their angry, rebellious anthems. Actually kicks a lot of ass, particularly the b-side; Saxon still have it!\n\n\u2018Nightmare\u2019 centres very proudly around it\u2019s massive, larger than life chorus hook, that is layers with harmonies by Biff, and gives off an almost Def Leppardesque vibe. The pace is slow in riffage is very simple, but Quinn and Oliver were always known for effective, well worked out but often simple riffs, which were admittedly coupled with often awesome leads and solos. Saxon hasn\u2019t abandoned their quest for anthemism in this one, and though it has a commercial, soft sound (particularly the production) it\u2019s still catchy, and energetic. I\u2019ve always liked this track. \u2018Midas Touch\u2019 is also a cool track, perhaps a little tougher this time round. From the crack of the first cycle of the dirty opening riff, you know you\u2019re in for classic Saxon. This chorus riff kicks ass and has an awesome guitar tone, while the slower pace of the verses is centred around soft, yet dominating Biff vocals, overtop very minimalist, soft and melancholic guitars. Lyrics are quite cool and very epic. Medieval sorta stuff with references to kings and Armageddon and such. The solo section in this one is beautiful and screams classic Saxon. The switch over is cool too. One of the better solos present on the full-length this was included. The drumming performance here is cool too, lots of heavy pounding and talented fills \u2013 particularly toward the end. \n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\n#32 In My NWOBHM Rarities Review Series\n\nFuck me what a brilliant single! \u2018Heavy Metal Thunder\u2019 is pure Saxon; if you ever wanted to introduce someone to the band, just stick this in the stereo, and crank the knobs to 11 \u2013 headbanging with come automatically, as will fist pumping, air guitar, and words sung or shouted along in imitation of one of heavy metal\u2019s most badass and legendary frontmen. This song blew me away in the early 2000\u2019s when I first heard it, in a live rendition on \u2018Greatest Hits Live\u2019 and you could tell right off the bat it was an essential part of every damn set they\u2019ve ever played since churning it out on the stunning full-length \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019. \u2018Taking your Changes\u2019 is a decent enough track, though slower and a bit more melodic and sung, it\u2019s also been a part of the live set and sits nicely alongside the more thundering speed metal numbers like the a-side. Two strong cuts here which would serve as a dominating first experience of the band.\n\n\u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 is usually considered among the best 3-4 full-lengths made by Saxon to date (and they have about 20 or so) and the a-side here really has a lot to do with that. Classic spine shattering dirty riffage in this song, as well as breakneck speed, and fists in the air catchiness in the chorus. Infectious, ruckus, raw, fast, nasty and yet melodic, this song is killer and is among Saxon\u2019s finest moments. Saxon was incredibly busy in 1980 too, churning out two full-lengths, playing a shitload of dates, and pressing promotional singles in between the usual drinking and rehearsing that goes along with heavy metal. And during this whirlwind of activity, somehow managed to write an anthem that would wind up a blueprint for speed metal, and spawn a thousand bands. The rebellious attitude of the song is carried through with Class by Biff\u2019s forceful hollering voice, which just screams British heavy metal, and Quinn and Oliver\u2019s classic guitar phrasing is excellent.\n\n\u2018Taking Your Changes\u2019 doesn\u2019t relent on raw \u2018tude, and continues the brilliant mating of killer proto speed metal guitars with Biffs melodic, yet forceful tone. The melodic chorus in this one will just urge singalong, and is utter party music, to be blasted knobs to the right, while good times roll. The clean guitars peppered throughout are a solid touch, I feel, and the main riff \u2013 though simplistic, just rocks along relentlessly throught the whole damn thing, while Biff hollers with conviction at the listener, to get the point of the track across aggressively. Guitar solos are outright stunning, with Quinn and Oliver just shredding to each other back and forth, into a fade-out. So much chemistry between the axemen here, not unlike Tipton/Downing, as they churn out excellent leads. Two brilliant stunners that nuked any competition in sight \u2013 Samson included; essential heavy metal.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nDespite the video for their cover of \"Ride Like the Wind\" having a reasonable rotation on MTV (usually on Headbanger's Ball), Saxon seemed to miss the mark with what could have been their breakthrough album. Destiny is often loathed by fans for its relative accessibility, but the truth is it's no more commercial than any of their previous albums, a slice of catchy NWOBHM which I still consider one of their career highlights, with ballads and rockers aplomb, all written in a bluesy, consistent aesthetic.\n\nThe presence of the typical 80s radio rock synthesizers is complementary and never forced, even as \"Ride Like the Wind\" opens. The Christopher Cross cover sounds quite nice in Saxon's able hands, Biff Byford's vocals blend seamlessly with the backups for the chorus. \"Where the Lightning Strikes\" is a slower paced rocker, anchored in a simple and perfect riff, the kind that has appeared on every Saxon record before and since. Again, the chorus is exactly what you are waiting for, powerful and understated. \"I Can't Wait Anymore\" is a love ballad with some nice leads and catchy clean guitars jangling beneath the verse. This is probably the type of song the album took some slack for, but its a good song and superior to many of the shitty glam rock ballads which polluted the airwaves during that era. \"Calm Before the Storm\" returns to the rock and Byford giving it his all, dripping with blue collar lyrics.\n\n\"S.O.S.\" starts with some blowing winds and ambiance, then a great teaser riff before the metal begins to rage, a mid-paced flow beneath yet another set of catchy vocal lines. \"Song for Emma\" is another power ballad, reminds me a lot of something Def Leppard would have done back then but with Byford's vocals (the bands have always had similar music). \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" rocks out like classic Saxon, killer riffs and an unforgettable chorus. \"We Are Strong\" is pretty typical synth driven rock fare, it's the weakest song on the album but still works for me. The album closes with two of its best tracks: \"Jericho Siren\" with its brilliant riffing and the hard rocking \"Red Alert\".\n\nThe album may sound dated to some, but quite adequate for the time. Lyrically the songs contain the same mix of everyman romance, history and world events that most of their albums do. Byford was younger here of course, but it remains one of his best vocal performances to date, he expressed a greater range than most of their earlier records. Although I am one of a dwindling few who personally loves this album, it's a difficult album to recommend, as I do not think it would appeal to fans of the more crunchy, power-metal fueled modern Saxon sound. However, if you loved the big budget hard rock of the 80s without too much of the glam crap (they did the hairspray thing briefly before realizing it didn't fit), and you love Biff's voice, you should give this a listen.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nThroughout the 30+ years of heavy metal's existence, few bands can be said to have 'kept it real' as much as the mighty Saxon. True to their roots, rarely deviating (they may have added a 'power metal' touch to a few of their 21st century albums, but then, they are one of the bands to inspire that entire genre in the first place), the final product is almost always one of high quality. Into the Labyrinth is the band's 19th studio album and it delivers in spades. This is pure Saxon, with a balance of their old school, hard rocking tunes and a few that will appeal to the more modern crowd.\n\nThe first thing one will notice is the HUGE sound of this album. Boasting a Charlie Bauerfiend production, Saxon has never really sounded this good in the studio before. The vocals are giving such a great depth, and the guitars are excellent. Opening track \"Battalions of Steel\" is an epic leaning in that more 'power' metal direction they have used on recent albums like Metalhead. Soaring vocals, simple yet effective riffs, and keyboard choirs deliver the goods, with a mighty chorus. \"Live to Rock\" pays tribute to all their old 'rock' titled songs, a very simple NWOBHM number reminiscent of older Priest, AC/DC and...Saxon! It's damn catchy. \"Demon Sweeny Todd\" is a faster tune based on the notorious folk character who has recently been revived in film. \"The Letter\" is a rarity, a pure acoustic track, quite nice. \"Valley of the Kings\" is one of my favorites here, a rousing, mid-paced melodic speed metal with an amazing bridge and chorus. \"Slow Lane Blues\" and \"Crime of Passion\" are grittier, bluesier, down-and-dirty metal tracks. \"Protect Yourself\" is a catchy slower track, not quite a power ballad but bordering on it. Another of the best tracks is \"Hellcat\", totally rocks.\n\nThe album is very consistent, and it should appeal to fans of the band from all periods. It's not nearly as good as last year's The Inner Sanctum, but considering just how damned good that album was, it would be a difficult act to follow. Regardless, this album has its share of classic Saxon tunes, simple and to the point, and proves just how much life is left in these veterans. They may never have been the darlings of NWOBHM when stacked against an Iron Maiden or Judas Priest, but we all know who is writing better albums today.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nBritish metallers Saxon\u2019s fourth album finds them in a great form. New Wave Of British Heavy Metal is at full bloom but unfortunately it will not last much longer. However these metal underdogs managed to preserve their myth. They have a strong line-up and their vocalist Biff Byford is one of the best in the metal scene. By the time they released Denim and leather they had made a good reputation. The nine songs of this album proved that they were not just a shooting star but they had come to stay.\n\nSome of the songs of this album became all-time classics adored by most metal fans. Princess of the Night is one of them. The title may fool you. Don\u2019t look for a girl because the lyrics speak of an old locomotive, its journeys and adventures. It is one of the fastest songs Saxon ever wrote. It has an addictive galloping pace and unmatchable solos. Probably my favorite song by Saxon, it creates dreams about endless walks on the rails of fantasy that awakens with every note of this hymn.\n\nSaxon didn\u2019t forget to dedicate a song to their loyal fans, those who kept the faith alive. This is the song that bears the title of the album, Denim and Leather. It is a steady mid-tempo piece but its true magic is revealed through the lyrics. The lyrics that, nowadays, remind us of some years ago when metal wasn\u2019t found in every corner. \u201cIt was you that set the spirit free\u201d sings Byford making us proud of our beliefs and ideals.\n\nAnd the Bands Played On\u2026 as shivers run up and down your spine, your senses are stimulated and tears glow through the eyes of us all, especially those who didn\u2019t meet heavy metal when Hammerfall appeared in the scene. Riff and chorus march together to create a genuine epic, with an intense war feeling to defend our heavy metal land. Saxon wrote a masterpiece that no pen can describe. Only your ears can help you realize the size of this song. By the way, Hammerfall was used only as an example. I have nothing against them. In fact I like them a lot.\n\nNever Surrender and Out of Control are songs that seem too typical but they are not. They don\u2019t lack in melodic harshness and their brilliant solos blind those who keep their eyes shut to the glorious light of metal. Rough n\u2019 Ready and Play it Loud have sharp, razor-edge guitars and nice breaks. They are simple hard rock played with metal tensions. It is suggested that you listen to them at maximum volume!\n\nMidnight Rider is another hard rock track with metal extensions, aiming to wound some sensitive ears. It is melodic and easy to listen to, yet it doesn\u2019t ignore its metal roots. It will excite you if you let yourself so. Fire in the Sky is quite a fast one, an ideal mix of power and melody. It\u2019s a successful balancing between heavy riff and beautiful chorus. Of course it features wonderful guitar parts and Byford\u2019s characteristic vocals. Certainly one more classic by Saxon.\n\nWith Denim and Leather Saxon contributed a great deal in the building of heavy metal\u2019s armor. It is not the perfect album; it may not even be their best. Still it\u2019s very good and metalheads all over should possess it.\n",
        "\nWell, what you probably wanna know is \u201cDoes it sound like classic Saxon (and therefore does it kick ass)? The answer \u2013 yes. This one kicks ass and has all that classic sound you want \u2013 without that faltering wimpiness many of you felt they came to embody in the mid/late 80\u2019s. present on this one are hare riffs, catchy melodies and awesome general arrangements, with few weak moments in the mix \u2013 just more classic Saxon, as great and fun to rock out as ever. I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t track down this one earlier. Many years ago \u2013 my introduction to the band was a CD of their greatest live hits \u2013 I was hooked. After that I set about collecting their early 80\u2019s hit albums, then their very earliest works, and the awesome 2000\u2019s releases, but this middle-period had somewhat eluded me. Usually early 90\u2019s releases aren\u2019t at the top of my priority list; reason being the old \u2018decline of metal\u2019 argument, during this period. Even if bands were still going (we could have guessed the juggernaut force of Saxon would never stop rockin\u2019), they often pussified their sound by attempting to add grunge, alternative rock, or god knows what else to their sound, often sounding like crap \u2013 and often being about as conducive to making you rock as a big sack of the stuff. What we have here is the complete antithesis of said statement; here Saxon continues their quest to rock harder than anyone, despite the wavering popularity of metal, and the tough times they were going through. They don\u2019t relent on rockin, fist in the air tunes, and craft some excellent metal here \u2013 very much classic Saxon doing what they do best.\n\nAnyway, many great tracks abound; \u2018One Step Away\u2019 is a mid-paced number with the hallmark ripping guitar solo, and classic Biff melodies. Totally memorable and catchy, and absolutely traditional Saxon for the purist. \u2018Iron Wheels\u2019 is a memorable, soft number, with very crisp acoustic guitars, and heart-touching working class British spirit. Lyrics are as British as \u2018Let it Rain\u2019 by Bruce Dickinson, and speak of one mans life in the coal mines, and descent into sadness. The point is gotten across by Biffs awesome, emotive vocals, great guitars, and generally awesome songwriting. Certainly a memorable and heartfelt softer number on par with any of I\u2019ve heard lately. \u2018Nighthunter\u2019 is a badass track centred around a massive chorus, with thundering double kick underneath. Cool lyrics and another ripping solo courtesy of Oliver make this one another track in the long lineage of awesome, straightforward rockers from this Juggernaut band. \u2018Forever Free\u2019 your title track is eaily the standout on this one however \u2013 an absolute classic worthy of any greatest hits album from the band. Thrilling chorus, and excellent, passionate and rebellious lyrics about motorcycles and liberty. Fucking killer number.\n\nThe main low-point of the album is the lame cover \u2018I Just Wanna Make Love to You\u2019 \u2013 a poor track which should have been tossed aside in favour of more balls-out rckin\u2019 about motorcycles, or English history. These lame covers have always irritated me \u2013 and I barely see a place for any cover on albums actually \u2013 I prefer them as b-sides or merely as part of the live set \u2013 although I don\u2019t see Wacken crowds appreciating this one either. While there are no real other low points, perhaps a couple tracks might just be a tad straightforward and lacking in dynamism. \u2018Cant Stop Rockin\u2019 is your obligatory rock-centred track, benefitted from tough riffs and excellent, vocal hooks courtesy of Biff. Another badass rocker in the tradition of the Awesome Saxon. Simplistic, yet utterly catchy and totally awesome. Formulaic \u2013 yes, but Saxon delivering the goods like always. \n\nWhile it\u2019s not the high point of their career this one still kicks total ass and gets its hooks into you a bit. I found myself repeatedly playing it on the ipod because, well \u2013 it\u2019s just more Saxon \u2013 and as we all know \u2013 Saxon rules. Yeah it doesn\u2019t quite have the freshness of WOS or Denim and Leather, or the complex layering of Lionheart or other more recent works, but continues the no BS rockin; in this dark time for metal with the same utter passion and honest conviction that Saxon were always known for. \u2018Get Down and Dirty\u2019 is a head-nodding, traditional rocker that could sit comfortably on any Saxon album, while not being amazing or complex. What we have here is a great, fun album besting most of the horrible drivel that was coming out at this time. Saxon sticks to their guns with British Bulldoggery and churns out more songs in the style they\u2019re known for. Far from a disappointment, this album has seen many plays already, and will not be a dust collector. Great party music as always from these true British stalwarts, and really re-instates your faith in heavy metal. A typically solid effort from Biff and crew \u2013 with the title track kicking a tonne of ass.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nSaxon \u2013 Wheels of Steel\n\n\u2018Wheels of Steel\u2019 is a long-time classic single from Saxon that\u2019s the title track of their most (along with Denim & Leather) successful album. This little single contains two strong numbers; both Saxon classics are thoroughly enjoyable in that fun Saxon kinda way. The title track is a slower, anthemic number that rumbles along, while \u2018Motorcycle Man\u2019 is suitably more of a \u2018high-octane\u2019 (ha!) number, with a bit more pace.\n\nIt was around the time of the release of this single that Saxon really started to take off, becoming one of the bands at the forefront of the NWOBHM movement, with a driving sounded still-rooted in 70\u2019s hard rock and fun party anthems. \u2019Wheels of Steel\u2019 is typical of this sound, with a slower, chantier feel to it throughout, and a focus on the very much \u2018rock\u2019 theme of highway cruisin\u2019 fast lifestyles and automobiles. The lyrics in this one are rebellious and free-spirited, with the chorus vocal being incredibly simplistic, yet catchy-as-all \u201cshe\u2019s got whe-els, wheels of steel\u201d \u2013 which you\u2019re sure to be chanting along to even the first time you hear it. This cut is particularly simplistic in terms of guitars and drums, with no real skill being evident, except for in the guitar solo \u2013 Saxon\u2019s guitar leads are something I\u2019ve always enjoyed. The slow thundering-ness of the riffs has a majestic, crashy effect though which is enjoyable as hell.\n\n\u2018Motorcycle Man\u2019 carries on the automobile-themed aesthetics of the release \u2013 yet in a pacier, more aggressive vein. This one\u2019s also a fan favourite with a frequent slot in their live set. Your motorcycle roaring past samples at the start are a nice touch, particularly through headphones. This one has the rebellious attitude present on the A-side with some effective touches \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t need no bull-shit!\u201d \u2013 The chorus is again simplistic however. There\u2019s a shit-load of reverb on the vocals here too \u2013 throughout the whole piece. The riffs in this one are simple, but are really brought to life by Biffs loud, energetic vocals, and some thunderous drums. \n\nAll-round this is a strong single in my opinion \u2013 Saxon crafting out their \u2018classic\u2019 sound by the point of this release, and churning out some great numbers. Pretty interesting that the whole thing is \u2018automobile-focused\u2019 and I\u2019m sure Saxon had a considerable \u2018petrolhead\u2019 fan-base. This one is a classic release with the sound being rooted in hard rock, with very little real \u2018metal\u2019 so to speak, being present. This one would also serve as a pretty good introduction to the band - classic Saxon!\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nSaxon \u2013 Princess of the Night\n\n\nSaxon is a great classic metal/NWOBHM act that is well-adept at crafting catchy numbers with plenty of melodic infusion and a \u2018fun\u2019 approach and sound that I for one enjoy. This single is no exception \u2013 a decent effort featuring the more melodic \u2018Princess of the Night\u2019 and the fun yet pacey number \u2018Fire in the Sky\u2019.\n\n\u2018Fire in the Sky\u2019 on the b-side of this release is a great yet often overlooked classic Saxon cut with a fun yet \u2018metal\u2019 feel to it and a rather thundering pace. What drives this one along nicely are the rather heavy drums, which are definitive of the Saxon sound. It\u2019s got as much heaviness and pace as any Saxon from this classic period, yet for some reason isn\u2019t a song you hear talked about, like the title track for example. \n\n\u2018Princess of the Night\u2019 is a great Saxon classic \u2013 a track that is always included in their live set and gets a guaranteed place on \u2018best of\u2019 releases. This tracks pretty darn typical of the majesty of Saxon \u2013 a fun, rock n roll infused blend of melodic hard rock in the 70\u2019s tradition, with a distinct metal edge. Saxon\u2019s guitars have always been great, with some great touches here. Melody and a very metallic, almost proto-thrash sound (typical of great NWOBHM acts) combine in this piece to make it a winner. \u2018Princess of the Night\u2019 is a song about an old steam train, which the protagonist had a fixation on as a young boy. It\u2019s kind of odd subject-matter in a way \u2013 not something you\u2019d expect to encounter, especially given the title of the song. I remember Biff saying in an interview once that he\u2019d have little Japanese girls running up to him saying \u201cI am the princess of the night!\u201d to which he would quip something along the lines of \u201cDo you way 90 fucking tonnes? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d \u2013 Hilarious.\n\nAnyway, this great little single features two strong numbers. A true Saxon classic in \u2018Princess of the Night\u2019 \u2013 with great lyrics in \u201cninety tonnes of thunder\u201d and \u201ciron scraping metal\u201d \u2013 thoroughly metal. \u2018Fire in the Sky\u2019 is a more metallic piece about some Armageddon-ish themes that\u2019s well-done. This release is strong and classic and is well-worth a listen. Would serve as a pretty good introduction to the band.\n\n-DeathRiderDoom\n",
        "\nHere we have an absolute paradox in the universe\u2019s way of development: Saxon\u2019s \u201cInto the Labyrinth,\u201d the umpteenth Saxon full-length, is not half-bad. Hell it\u2019s actually pretty damn good. But that doesn\u2019t make any sense, because this isn\u2019t anything new or remotely altered. After witnessing Biff\u2019s 2009 voice, Paul Quinn\u2019s wonderful guitar playing, and Saxon\u2019s constant delivery of goods, our peers have reached the verdict: Saxon still means business and won\u2019t settle for mediocre junk. \u201cInto the Labyrinth\u201d turns that hypothesis into fact like water into steam; it\u2019s surprisingly consistent, and certainly a highlight in Saxon\u2019s epic legacy. \n\nAs interesting as it may sound, Saxon doesn\u2019t move toward new areas during \u201cInto the Labyrinth\u201d in any way; it\u2019s just Saxon being Saxon. Although nothing outside the box, these gentlemen oddly keep the liquids pumping with what you\u2019d expect from our British chaps: heavy, intelligent riffing that leans toward edges both on the power metal spectrum (speed, melody) and simple grooves worshipping Sabbath, complex percussion doing the every-heavy-metal-record routine, and climaxing solos that are indeed wild in nature, yet fitting to Saxon\u2019s origin. Personally, Biff\u2019s vocals are in the album\u2019s limelight without any sense of shyness, as those bluesy, golden chimes mastering a nifty synapse between classic rock and heavy metal roll on freely, with no sign of some faded vocalist that ran his course years ago, I might add. Overall, Saxon remains just like Saxon. \n\nAs for standout anthems, this little CD contains more individual perks than a record of fillers. With \u201cBattalions of Steel\u201d as the opener, the listener soon acquires the vindictive apparatus Saxon applies: hard-edged instrumentation looking simple and rhythmic, but also vicious and highly likeable. \u201cDemon Sweeney Todd,\u201d however, thrives off ripping speed riffs, fast percussion, and Biff\u2019s rough-edged voice dicing through Saxon\u2019s usual method of execution; certainly unusual, but incredibly enjoyable nonetheless. \u201cValley of the Kings\u201d is another soon-to-be classic due to that galloping riff and catchy chorus that draws you in like heroin, which leaves Saxon acting like aged cheese that\u2019s obviously old, but delicious.\n\nTo be frank, there is absolutely no reason why this album should be good: Saxon is older than time itself, they\u2019ve recycled most of their material without hesitation, and have stuck to an identical formula for three decades now, but \u201cInto the Labyrinth\u201d provides the essential vitamins for this musical garden to thrive through a famine, so to speak. Perhaps Saxon gives evidence to the Lemmy Theory, meaning there need not be anything new in order to serve some churning pieces of flaming metal; although unbelievable, \u201cInto the Labyrinth\u201d rotates like clockwork. Buy this record, and watch these well-aged metal musicians reach the cheese at the maze\u2019s end.\n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nYou'd think a band would start to lose steam after so many years, after all, so many of them have \u2014 Maiden, Priest, Sabbath \u2014 but here's Saxon, eighteen albums into a 30+ year career, still kicking some major ass. If you've been following Saxon's recent works like Lionheart and Metalhead then this album will contain no surprises at all. It isn't quite as good as their other recent albums, but it is still really good.\n\nWhen I'm listening to the glorious, magnificent opening track \"Battalions Of Steel\" I can hardly believe that this is not a perfect album \u2014 it really is one of the best three or four songs they have ever written. Other standout cuts are the heavy-as-fuck speedster \"Demon Sweeny Todd\" and the epic \"Valley Of The Kings\". The problem with this album is that as high as the highs are, there is too much filler, and a lot of it is very blues-heavy hard rock. Not that I'm opposed to that in principle, but it derails the epic feel of this album and ruins the flow. \"Live To Rock\" is okay, but \"Crime Of Passion\" is pretty dull, as is \"Hellcat\". Some of the songs, like \"Slow Lane Blues\" and \"Come Rock Of Ages\" have good riffs and some killer playing, but they are just too bluesy to be my bag. Maybe they should just do a blues album and get it out of their systems so the next Saxon album won't be schizo like this one.\n\nA worthy album, with some incredible high points, but uneven and filler-heavy overall. Saxon fans should not pass it up, and everyone should hear \"Battalions Of Steel\", because it's one of the great metal songs of 2009.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nCannon to the left of them, cannon to the right, cannon in front of them, volley\u2019d and thunder\u2019d; the Gumby! Hear the roar of 15,000 Gumbies as they follow General Byford\u2019s order of attack. See the swarm of red and the flashing of blades as the boys all charge into the glorious battle, their uniforms all strangely similar to that red number Biff wore on the \u2018Crusader\u2019 tour\u2026 into the valley of death they fumbled. It\u2019s the final battle of true 80\u2019s heavy metal Saxon as the onslaught of the lures of bouillon and spandex would pervert our warriors on their course.\n\nThe battle started well, the guitars burst forth with life and volleyed into the smoke in which an as yet uncertain future of British traditional heavy metal was to be decided. In the foggy gloom awaited businessmen, screaming teenage girls and record label executives. All beckoning Saxon to ditch the true faith and hopefully get that house in Spain they were hankering for. But at first the tried and true sound of metallic thunder rang true and it seemed as if we were in for another streamlined metal classic like what had came before. It was melodic and brilliant, perhaps more so than what came before. Lord Tennyson himself was noted to have risen from the grave and congratulate the band for delivering a perfect and vaguely jingoistic battle hymn. He too noted that Graham Oliver\u2019s scintillating solo was the band\u2019s best\u2026 I guess he had a soft spot for dive-bombing on the G-string too.\n\nWhat followed was familiar but still quite enjoyable; \u2018Red Line\u2019 was perhaps a little by-numbers in its approach but still a welcome if unimaginative song. \u2018Warrior\u2019 harkened back to the Lizzy masterpiece \u2018Emerald\u2019 as well as Judas Priest\u2019s 70s output. Biff\u2019s vocals were probably a little too quirky but still far from bad.\n\nGas! Gas! Quick, boys! An ecstasy of fumbling followed and all of a sudden the band found themselves writing commercial lightweight clunkers after Steve Dawson catted up most of his lungs. \u2018This Town Rocks\u2019 was its name and it was a sign of things to come, something big was brewing and it wasn\u2019t the product of the band\u2019s dinner of curry and bitter in their stomachs. Malfeasance within the ranks and it was to progress in this way. NWOBHM roots were betrayed for hair metal hollow glories\u2026 it was a ridiculous decision. You know you\u2019re in trouble when Biff is the \u2018good-looking\u2019 one, this almost guaranteed limited success in the image conscious hair metal world. Def Leppard you are not, I found that out without much real trying, Saxon took the best part of a decade to discover this\u2026 not the brightest bunch. \n\nMost of what followed from then was slightly empty, lacking the vitality of earlier albums and at times falling far short. But \u2018The Eagle has Landed\u2019 was an interesting if somewhat incomplete epic. Still the spaced-out and atmospheric guitars gave it weight in this somewhat hollow album. \n\nAfter the hurly burly had been done, that battle was lost not won. The smoke cleared and no one was really quite sure what had happened but the one with the moustache turned to the others and said, \u201cYou know what lads? I really do want a house in Spain\u201d and so the slow descent into sub-Scorpions arena rock began and it was vaguely amusing. But still \u2018Power & the Glory\u2019 remains an interesting footnote in the history of how English traditional heavy metal whimpered its way out of the spotlight.\n",
        "\nSaxon have been around for quite some time and when any band has a lengthy discography, it can get tricky to retain fan\u2019s interests and create something completely fresh. After four years, the band have finally put out some new material in the shape of The Inner Sanctum.\n\nThe album covers a fair amount of land, musically. The tempos differ, the drums can be over simplistic to highly creative and the heaviness varies from track to track. The opening song \u2018State Of Grace\u2019 is rather melodic compared the heavy metal that Saxon are accustomed to making. Needless to say, this track is not a sign of things to come.\n\nThis release serves as a reminder as to why Saxon were at the forefront of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. While songs such as \u2018I Have To Rock (To Stay Alive)\u2019 clearly pay homage to the band\u2019s earlier days, \u2018Ashes To Ashes\u2019 deals with a modernized sound. \u2018Atila The Hun\u2019 is the stand out track on the album. The instrumental \u2018Empire Rising\u2019 emanates an epic feel, working as a fine introduction to \u2018Atila The Hun\u2019. The drumming is explosive, the use of keyboards translates well into the track and a war like feel is conjured up successfully.\n\nThis album is wrestling between pure predictability and an effort to do what modern bands are doing to stay fresh. It leaves the band horrendously mixed up and exposes their lack of ideas. It is a typical Saxon album.\n\nOriginally written for www.rockbeast.co.uk\n",
        "\nPicture yourself in the world famous Barnsley Opera house, amongst hundreds of fellow Gumby enthusiasts. \u201cSax \u2018un\u201d \u201cSax \u2018un\u201d, bays the man next to you; excitement has reached fever pitch. It\u2019s Saxon at the height of their powers, the peak just before the slow descent into barely passable hair metal. And finally, over the PA we hear\u2026\n\n\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Derek and Trevor tour\u201d\n\nGuitars scream, bassists point and Biff informs you that \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 is off the \u2018Strong Arm\u2026\u2019 album, a shocking revelation if there ever was one. It certainly isn\u2019t the coolest gig in town, nor by 1982 is it the heaviest and it certainly isn\u2019t the best looking, but by God is it fun. \n\nSo indeed, this is Saxon at the very pinnacle of the commercial and creative powers. With a set-list culled from such SYGM classics as \u2018Wheels of Steel\u2019, \u2018Strong Arm\u2026\u2019 and of course, \u2018Denim and Leather\u2019. But some found the original, a mere single vinyl, was incomplete. But thankfully, Biff and the boys have rectified this problem adding a whole assortment of bonus tracks. Sure \u2018Midnight Rider\u2019 and \u2018Dallas 1pm\u2019 aren\u2019t my favourite Saxon tracks, but they sound a hell of a lot better in the live environment. The most important addition here is the sing-along brilliance of \u2018The Bands Played On\u2019, no Saxon gig would be complete without this. Yet still, no \u2018Denim and Leather\u2019, madness!\n\nInterestingly enough, in the albums pacing, we kick off with three different transport modes. Motorcycles, yeah they\u2019re rock \u2019n\u2019 roll alright. A 747? Ok, if it\u2019s going for an emergency landing and not a commercial flight to Benidorm. A train delivering post? Oh please, Mr Byford, try to hide the fact that backstage instead of hookers and blow you have a model train! What d\u2019ya mean no? Fuck, even Rush are cooler than you guys, at least they have roast chickens for a back-line. Still, terminally uncool moments aside, this a very forceful and dramatic way to open a live album. Saxon\u2019s uncouth nature certainly never hindered them in the live environment, they always remind me of a dog who just can\u2019t wait to bound and leap away after his master\u2019s stick and then chase his own tail until he becomes dizzy and falls over. Throughout their career, the band\u2019s enthusiasm in the live arena is both astounding and commendable. I\u2019ve watched footage of the band playing a backwater festival somewhere in Europe or even to a pub full of indie kids who expected a surprise gig from The Cure and they still command the stage as if they were playing Wembley Stadium. Just shows how good a live band you can be if you don\u2019t mind that your band looks like they were given fifteen quid to spend in a charity shop for stage wear. \n\n\u2018The Eagle has Landed\u2019 aptly displays the seamless shifting Saxon utilise. For every proto-thrash metal barrage such as the frantic \u2018Heavy Metal Thunder\u2019 we get a more boogied piece of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll in say \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 or metal\u2019s greatest paean to disabled women, \u2018Wheels of Steel\u2019. This pacing ensures, that unlike Biff\u2019s claims the audience will not actually die from exhaustion and in all makes for a very enjoyable listen.\n\nSpecial praise must be given to Nigel Glockler, who not only gives an exemplary performance on drums, but was only in Saxon for about fifteen minutes prior to these recordings, after Pete Gill was given his marching orders. As well as being the most accomplished musician in Saxon at this point, Nigel gives a lesson in speed metal precision. See the rip-roaring finale of \u2018Machine Gun\u2019, this is double bass utilised to perfection. If you want double bass to really give a song weight, use it tastefully rather than relentlessly (unless you are say, Philthy Animal Taylor). Complete overuse will limit it\u2019s dramatic and sonic effect, so putting a rather break-neck bit of double bass at a song\u2019s climax is a far more refreshing approach than the unrelenting modern approach to this technique. \n\nHowever, \u2018The Eagle Has Landed\u2019 did have the same curse of the live album that has stricken so many of rock\u2019s hopefuls. Mot\u00f6rhead had the exact same problem with \u2018No Sleep\u2026\u2019, how do you follow a immensely successful live album with what are considered to be your \u201cgreatest hits\u201d? A very difficult question indeed. Often bands struggle and flail, \u2018Iron Fist\u2019, \u2018Power and the Glory\u2019 and even UFO\u2019s \u2018No Place to Run\u2019 show this, all are far from bad, just somewhat uninspired compared to the live majesty that preceded them. \n\nSo a seminal NWOBHM document and one of metal\u2019s best live albums. An absolutely mandatory purchase for those with an interest as to why Saxon kick unexplainable amounts of arse. But why no \u2018Derek and Trevor\u2019? Shame really, oh well, all together now;\n\u201cDerek and Trevor, brought us all together!\u201d\n",
        "\nWhile a guest appearance by Elton John doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence in the \u2018metalness\u2019 of an album, don\u2019t let that put you off or let the critics fool you. Rock the Nations doesn\u2019t deviate as far from the quality or style of classic Saxon as some would have you believe.\n\nIn fact, this album is almost textbook Saxon. We have the standard songs about the glory of rock and roll, the obligatory head pounding, banner waving speed metal war epic, a sappy power ballad and the usual nonsense about motorcycles on the highway and sex with hot teenage girls.\n\nOf course, this all flows about as well as cream cheese, but then Saxon have built an entire career on albums with no logical song progression whatsoever. All things considered, there\u2019s a lot to like here. The riffs are chunky and catchy in equal measure, Biff is as powerful as ever, and the production, much like the band, is rock solid and workmanlike, if a little unspectacular.\n\nWhile the band were rapidly losing relevance by this time in the face of the American thrash juggernaut (and this is hardly going to challenge Peace Sells or Master of Puppets for album of \u201986), there\u2019s still plenty of enjoyable, old school British heavy metal to be had here. It's by no means their finest hour, but definitely recommended for fans of the band or the style.\n",
        "\nSaxon, the undisputed kings of South Yorkshire Gumby metal (SYGM) and general all round scrappy Yorkshire Terrier\u2019s of NWOBHM. Biff and the boys get a fairly bad reputation both inside and outside of the metal scene. Why you ask? Well, some strange people see the whole Spinal Tap comparison as a negative thing\u2026bizarre! But if you can get over the short comings of Biff Byford\u2019s wardrobe, you\u2019ll surely find some of the greatest rocked up metal around. \n\nNWOBHM was a complete mess of sounds, generally using an umbrella term to keep the music press happy (much like the did with grunge ten years later). Venom sounded like a washing machine full of bricks, Def Leppard spent too much time on their backing vocals, Witchfynde, Witchfinder General, Witchfynder General and General Fynder Witch all imploded without too much hassle and delivered some unfocused variant from the Sabbath mould, but Saxon just provided a most enjoyable AC/DC meets Priest rocking groove that pleased both rock and metal fans. If you enjoyed \u2018British Steel\u2019 era Priest then this will be right up your street, if not then I suggest you try before you buy, saving us the \u201cSaxon ist not krieg!\u201d reviews. \n\nFour out of the eight songs here stand up to me as absolute metal classics, guarded in metal\u2019s sacred halls by the Thundercats, yeah, why not? \u2018Princess of the Night\u2019 is embryonic speed metal and has some deceptively simple riffing. Saxon, being as they are, didn\u2019t sing much about Satan and Valhalla as such this song is about fucking trains. Not even trains carrying legions of the night to do battle with angels, just a train bringing Biff his copy of Gumby Monthly. \u2018Never Surrender\u2019 is a ripping \u201cbacks against the wall\u201d type song with brilliant generic bouncy NWOBHM riffs and an effortlessly catchy chorus. Not so much trains in this one. \u2018And the Bands Played On\u2019 is perhaps the greatest Saxon song ever, with it\u2019s sing along lead lines (ala \u2018747\u2019) and nicely layered riffs. It was Saxon\u2019s ode to the 1980 Monsters of Rock festival, at which they apparently killed at. It is also of note that Saxon writes a song dedicated to every gig they\u2019ve ever done, yes really;\n\u2018Dunstable Civic Hall, 1995, there was 155 there!\u2019.\n\u2018Denim and Leather\u2019 is another NWOBHM anthem and understandably a live favourite- a masterpiece of Gumby metal sing along brilliance. Isn\u2019t the \u2018maybe you can learn play the bass\u2019 line comedy gold? After dreaming of guitar and smashing up the drums, the bass must be learnt as a afterthought\u2026if one line in metal ever did capture all the mystique of the faceless bassist then this is it! Anyway, it\u2019s one of the best AC/DC songs Angus and Mal never wrote. \n\nThe other songs here are generally excellent too. \u2018Fire in the Sky\u2019 is an gold old slab of NWOBHM speed, with some excellent guitar harmonies and Priest aspiring solos. \u2018Play it Loud\u2019 is a lovable romp about never turning your music down and kicking lifeguards who take a disliking to Deep Purple (maybe it was Candice Night?). \u2018Midnight Rider\u2019 is the only song I don\u2019t enjoy here, it reeks of \u2018Hello America\u2019 and musically it does nothing that the other tracks don\u2019t do better. I mean I know your from Barnsley and are totally stoked by \u201cbloody automobile highways\u201d and \u201csun shining all of t\u2019 bloody night\u201d but spare me the details. \n\nSaxon always have been economic rather than flashy and \u2018Denim and Leather\u2019 stands up as an excellent example of heavy metal precision, much like those steam engines Biff is so obsessed by (who is he Fred fucking Dibnah? Steeplejack heavy metal!). The band generally perform excellently with lots of memorable hooks, riffs and solos. Pete Gill\u2019s performance was a bit disappointing for me as I was already aware of his phenomenal drumming with Mot\u00f6rhead and as such I knew he could sound a lot better than he does here\u2026not that this is Lars Ulrich drumming by any means. I suppose it\u2019s also that he uses less double bass than on \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 as well\u2026crikey, that shows this albums age, when double bass was still something noteworthy in metal!\n\nLooking to get all nostalgic for a time when England actually still was a proud heavy metal nation? Look no further, Biff and the boys will have you leathered up in no time (no, not lathered, bad Pete) and rocking like a Gumby in a time when every metal fan dressed like some denim clad refugee.\n\nParagraphing edited along with some minor spelling and grammatical errors. I\u2019m going to do this with most of my reviews now.\n",
        "\nSince I started to listen to hard rock / metal back in 2003, Saxon has been one of the bands that has followed me since the beginning. Their far away from being my favorite band but I do like them and \"Innocence Is No Excuse\" is the album by theirs that has grown most and become my favorite. I don't really understand why it's so ignored because it's a really great album. Maybe it's a little polished and heading towards a more American sound of metal than English but it's still Saxon, and a damn great one as well.\n\nI totally love classic 80's metal so this is of course an excellent album for me and there's a lot of great, melodic, classic and catchy tunes here. The whole birthday package starts off with a great rocker called \"Rockin' Again\" in which you'll immediately find yourself playing air guitar. It's followed by a radio-friendly but awesome song called \"Call Of The Wild\". It has a great guitar riff and the chorus is simply perfect. Next up is a 3-in-a-row group that can be identified as \"screamin' heavy metal\" due to the screamin' riffs and power overall. \"Broken Heroes\" was the big hit from this album and it's awesome, enough said. The remaining tracks are like a group too. It's four tracks that can be simply called \"hard rock\" or \"heavy metal\", it's pretty much up to you but they are a little special with their unique sound. My dad has the vinyl of this which ends here but I got the re-issue with two bonus tracks from \"Crusader\", \"Just Let Me Rock\" and \"Do It All For You\". These are another two great tracks although, they don't fit to 100 % with the original tracks.\n\nThe production is great. A little polished but actually that's not anything I care 'bout. I like the mix the way it is and it fits the tunes on here very well. Everything's balanced and I like the sound of every instrument on here. The guitars sounds awesome, especially the solos that's perfectly mixed. The drums (especially the snare drum) sounds awesome too, I really dig that mix they've made. Biff's vocals are sounding great too, maybe the best sounding vocals ever recorded on one of Saxon's albums?\n\nThe cast is doing simply great. They're all very experienced musicians and they are really sure on what they do. Biff Byford is probably the one who shines the most here but everyone has done a fabulous job for this album.\n\nSo finally to my last comments on \"Innocence Is No Excuse\"......\n\nThe best cuts here would be: Rockin' Again, Call Of The Wild, Devil Rides Out, Broken Heroes and maybe Raise Some Hell. All of the tracks are great and outstanding in anyway, the bonus tracks too.\n\nI can strongly recommend this album for any fans of classic 80's metal, biker metal or whatever metal at all! It's an album that should be in your collection or at least you should dig it up for a listen!\n\nEnjoy \"Innocence Is No Excuse\".\n",
        "\nForget the legend! The note does not come from \"it's Saxon after all\" and blah blah blah, I give'em 90% because the record IS worth such note. And additionally, yes, the old classic band puts out another album, that's right. Most modern poser bands may just stand in shock and awe.\n\nAt the same time the CD is epic and rock and rolly, it has some gig feeling, and some battle, monumental moments. It makes a real worthy listen, because the listener doesn't get bored with the third song about the same, the lyrics vary and so does the music.\n\nThe opener \"State of Grace\" is a somewhat dark and mystic, but positive song, that resembles medieval Europe and its widespread Christianity. It begins with a Gregorian chant-like voice with clean guitar, and then distortion comes... It's rock, good and loud noise. This number is stuck at my head, I hope forever.\n\nThen come two party-songs, \"Need For Speed\" and \"Let Me Feel Your Power\" - good old Saxon with modern sound. The ballad (very powerful) \"The Red Star Falling\" moves me not only for the music and lyrics, but for that my country (Poland) has itself been oppressed by the red star not so long ago. \n\nBut no stopping, here we go again, because \"I've Got To Rock\". And so it is, rock as hell, everyone just listen because THIS is how heavy metal should be like.\n\nThe end is epic, epic, eeepiiiic! \"Empire Rising\" as an intro, and then \"Attila the Hun\" - an 8-minute piece of destruction, war, fire and whatever else. If your head hasn't been blown off your neck, listen again!\n\nAaargh, a real piece of heavy metal, a metal slab to bang head against... Saxon are real masters, for they have been good 20 years ago, and now are getting better. I'm listening to them all day today, and eagerly wait for another CD!\n",
        "\nThis self titled debut album comes from one of the most talented NWOBHM acts, an album which will be a great influence for some of the bigger metal acts in history (such as Metallica, for instance) and will open the way to new genres in the metal music. As for today this album doesn't sounds so special or outstanding of course, if you know something about metal it won't surprise you too much. But as for 1979, I ain't sure why the hell this album wasn't a huge success. I mean, this IS heavy metal with balls, and a good one, and back then in the end of the 70's it's supposed to be something groundbreaking doesn't it? Anyway, if you are looking for a great old school heavy metal, keep reading, you won't regret after knowing this album.\n\n'Saxon' have mostly simple, catchy heavy metal tracks such as 'Backs To The Wall', 'Stallions of The Highway' and 'Big Teaser' with simple and rhythmic power chords riffing which are easy for listening and also pretty enjoyable. Sometimes bordering in the 'hard rock' genre, but doesn't gets pussy for a bit and flows pretty well. However, for me the highlight of this album is the opening track 'Rainbow Theme/Frozen Rainbow' which is by all means one of the best epic NOWBHM songs ever written. It opens with quite loud bass and then comes in a regular power chord strumming, it doesn't sounds like it's an epic song at start, it builds up pretty well and sounds like a good hard rock tune, and then the drums rolling a bit and after a minute and half it slows down. The vocals are very melodic and epic, the guitars has some great fills and adding some cool variations to this song. The chorus is quite catchy and epic as well and the lead guitar is marvelous. The solo is moderate, deep, epic and thrilling. Just well constructed and flows greatly. Then the first riffing comes in and the song becomes a bit faster and ends in kinda hard rock tune, as how the album will continue till it's end.\n\nWhat can I say, this is one of the greatest heavy metal albums from the 70's. The song writing is great (and it will just improve in time), there aren't any bad tracks, it's short and valuable album which marks the first breaths of the wonderful NWOBHM genre. You can't miss this album if you are into old fashioned heavy metal, you simply can't. Great debut of a great band!\n",
        "\nThis is a very good compilation that is a neat overview of Saxon\u2019s material in the 80s.\nAlmost every song is worthy of being on here, except maybe \u201cThis Town Rocks.\u201d \n\n\u201cRide Like the Wind\u201d is a Christopher Cross cover (soft rock singer) that\u2019s actually pretty good. Nice melody and a very catchy chorus. Kind of has a Def Leppard feel to it (in a good way). \u201cCrusader\u201d and \u201cBroken Heroes\u201d are very epic and, again, very melodic. \u201cCrusader\u201d is an anthem about the Crusades. \u201cBroken Heroes\u201d is a tribute for soldiers that were killed in battle. \u201cDallas 1PM\u201d is a song of tragedy about the assassination of John F. Kennedy. \u201cMidas Touch\u201d (about King Midas in Greek Mythology), \u201cDenim and Leather\u201d, \u201cStrong Arm of the Law\u201d, \u201cNever Surrender\u201d, and \u201cHeavy Metal Thunder\u201d are more aggressive and some of the best Saxon songs ever. \n\nThis compilation has songs from albums that are only known for one great track. Those songs are \u201cCrusader\u201d (from Crusader), \u201cRide Like the Wind\u201d (from Destiny), and \u201cBroken Heroes\u201d (from Innocence is No Excuse). This eliminates the need to buy those albums individually as you get all of the best songs from those albums on this compilation. This compilation is also good because it mostly focuses on earlier Saxon material which is good because early 80s Saxon is more fierce than late 80s Saxon. Of course, now, Saxon is heavier than they ever were, dropping the pop sheen to their songs that plagued them in the past.\n\nFavorite Tracks: Almost all of them\n",
        "\nFrom humble beginnings as Son of a Bitch to the recording of classic NWOBHM albums such as Wheels of Steel and Denim and Leather, to attempting 80's hard rock, to experimenting with German power metal in the later days, British metal band Saxon has come a long way. They've released a few good albums, a few mediocre albums, but the band is generally regarded as one of the strongest New Wave of British Heavy Metal acts both today and back in the musical movement's heyday. Now in their 31st year of existence (my, time sure flies), Saxon doesn't really have much to prove. But does that mean they're just going to sit back and coast through another four albums? If The Inner Sanctum is anything to judge by then, no, the Barnsley rockers still going strong.\n\nSo what type of musical direction does Saxon take on The Inner Sanctum, the band's eighteenth studio album? To tell the truth, the record is somewhat of a combination of old and new. The razor German power metal sound of Lionheart mixed with the fun, hard hitting NWOBHM sound of Wheels of Steel. Unsurprisingly enough, this stylistic combination works out quite well, with the aggressive, melodic nature of the former compliment the raw, classic elements of the later influences. Particularly effective is the band's frontman Bliff Byford. For the most part, Bliff sounds like either Helloween vocalist Andi Deris (see State of Grace), Grave Digger vocalist Chris Boltendahl (Let Me Feel Your Power), a combination of both (Ashes to Ashes), or, well, classic Bliff Byford (Going Nowhere Fast). Despite his age, Byford still delivers stunning wails, screams, sung moment, and really, anything else one would expect him to do. He will never be considered one of the genre's better vocalists; however, he always delivers an excellent performance throughout the album.\n\nAt 5:37, The Inner Sanctum's opening track State of Grace would be one of, if not the finest tracks on the album. After about a quite minute long intro which helps create suspense and interest in the music, the song morphs into a Helloween influenced piece of work. It's not quite as savage sounding as Let Me Feel Your Power or Atila the Hun and not quite as catchy and anthemic as the likes of Going Nowhere Fast or I've Got to Rock (To Stay Alive), but the song still packs quite a punch with its mystical feel. Atila the Hun, the album's epic at over 8 minutes as another superb track in which each of Saxon's five man line-up proves his worth, especially guitarists Paul Quinn and Doug Scarratt, who's sharp, duelling axe work would put many of their contemporaries to shame. However, three of The Inner Sanctum's middle tracks, specifically I've Got to Rock (To Stay Alive), Red Star Falling, and Going Nowhere Fast are not the strongest songs Saxon has ever crafted. Fans of the English band's mid to late 80's works will probably enjoy them, as they're quite similar. However, to me they seem more like weak filler tracks and somewhat disrupt the flow of the album. While they do not necessarily kill The Inner Sanctum, as the rest of the tracks are excellent, I just cannot give the album a higher score because of them.\n\nWith that said, The Inner Sanctum is a very good record from a very underrated band. With album number eighteen Saxon definitely shows that their age has not caught up with their music's quality, nor will they coast aimlessly through the rest of their playing days. With songs such as Need for Speed and If I Was You the British band puts forth efforts which reflect its past sound and its present sound. Really, if you're a fan of Saxon, or any other similar band, The Inner Sanctum is an album you'll want to pick up. It's that good. \n\n(Originally written fro Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nSaxon are the definition of a band you can count on, lately anyway. After that ill-advised mid-period spent chasing the Def Leppard gravy train, the English veterans have made something of a miracle recovery, and since 1997\u2019s \u2018Unleash the beast\u2019 have been on a remarkably solid run of releases that now reaches number 5 with \u2018The inner sanctum.\u2019 Since forsaking the pursuit of commercial appeal, the band have taken considerable influence from the German power metal scene. Blending this with their classic NWOBHM beginnings Saxon have found a new style that essentially produces 3 types of song \u2013 the old-fashioned hard rockers and atmospheric epics they have always been known for, now joined by modern-sounding power metal tracks with a newfound sense of heaviness.\n\nThis last type of song is featured most prominently at the beginning of the CD, with the 2nd and 3rd songs, \u201cNeed for speed\u201d and \u201cLet me feel your power\u201d among the heaviest songs Saxon have ever done. \u201cNeed for speed,\u201d in particular, lives up to its name with its almost speed metal riffing and aggressive drumming. This last aspect is one thing you will notice right from the outset and deserves special mention \u2013 Nigel Glockler is back, and he apparently wants everyone to know it, too. Returning after an absence of almost 10 years, the veteran turns in what may be the best drumming performance on any Saxon release to date. Variety and heaviness of this sort hasn\u2019t been heard from Glockler before - particularly on the faster numbers, and not least the end section of \u2018Need for speed,\u2019 which features what could almost be considered a blast beat.\n\nWhile \u2018The inner sanctum\u2019 offers nothing new, even for Saxon themselves, it makes up for this, firstly, and most importantly, through the enjoyable nature of the songs, but also because the CD is the band\u2019s most consistent in some time. The preceding 3 efforts, \u2018Metalhead,\u2019 \u2018Killing ground\u2019 and \u2018Lionheart\u2019 are all highly enjoyable CDs with serious stand-out tracks, but all suffer a few undeniable weaker moments along the way. \u2018The inner sanctum,\u2019 conversely, perhaps offers fewer outright stunning songs, but of the 9 on display here there really isn\u2019t a thing to grumble about.\n\nThe middle of the album goes in a more traditional direction, with a few mid-paced conventional metal/hard rock numbers that vary slightly in quality before the heaviness returns for the 8-minute closing track \u201cAtila the hun,\u201d a dark and aggressive epic. This sits somewhat at odds with the opening track, \u201cState of grace,\u201d which focuses more on emotional atmosphere, helped greatly by an understated vocal performance from Biff Byford and sampled Gregorian chanting (in the style of Iron Maiden\u2019s mighty \u201cSign of the cross\u201d), and the 2 bookend the CD with contrasting types of \u2018epic.\u2019\n\nWhen at its worst, for the want of a better word, \u2018The inner sanctum\u2019 is merely slightly unengaging, which is high praise indeed for a band in their 30th year of existence. For the most part, this CD is a highly enjoyable listen and definitely the overall best Saxon have recorded in some time. Their glory days are definitely behind them, but this is a band that, fashionable or not, still has plenty to offer the contemporary metal scene, and their continued efforts are to be appreciated. \u2018The inner sanctum\u2019 in all likelihood won\u2019t be topping any year end lists, but its place in or around this reviewer\u2019s top 10 probably won\u2019t be in any danger.\n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com)\n",
        "\nIf there ever was a record that tried just a little too hard to represent the early 80s heavy metal phenomenon, but was nowhere near good or interesting enough musically to live up to this promise, it has to be Saxon\u2019s quintunessential \u2018Denim and Leather.\u2019 The band may be entirely forgotten today \u2013 they\u2019re still touring to a cult following \u2013 but these Yorkshiremen were once one of the biggest names in the home-grown New Wave Of British Heavy Metal movement (NWOBHM). On its release in 1981, this album hit #9 and the single reached number 12. This means that, at one time, people were more interested in listening to Saxon than Tony Capstick & the Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band.\n\n\u2018Denim and Leather,\u2019 while completely mediocre, is nevertheless regarded as a genre classic by many. It\u2019s certainly the last \u2018quite-good\u2019 album the band would produce in its original style, before moving to a more polished \u2018quite-bad\u2019 sound in a consistently failed attempt to break into the American market like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest managed (Saxon lacked only the talent). Whilst very little of Saxon\u2019s output is comparable to their contemporaries even in this alleged classic period, the early albums are mostly enjoyable affairs, especially if you enjoy songs driven by derivative guitar riffs and embarrassing macho lyrics, as I do. You\u2019d still be better off listening to Manowar, but Saxon were always a lot more radio-friendly.\n\n\u2018Denim and Leather,\u2019 follows the more impressive \u2018Wheels of Steel\u2019 and \u2018Strong Arm of the Law\u2019 released in quick succession the previous year, and is sadly the weakest of the three. This album suffers in a similar way to Iron Maiden\u2019s sophomore release \u2018Killers\u2019 of the same year (which still fared better), by containing some classic, immortal staples of the Saxon live set amidst a sea of forgettable mediocrity. The main songs in question are helpfully singled out at the start and end of the album, in the form of the energetic \u2018Princess of the Night\u2019 lamenting a decomissioned train \u2013 not a prostitute like you thought \u2013 and the anthemic title track. \u2018And the Bands Played On\u2019 is slower and more heartfelt, and probably the highlight of the recording, as well as incredibly short to boot. It isn\u2019t a flaw of Saxon albums that they never hit the forty-minute mark, as they were defecated forth from the studio in such rapid succession as to exceed the yearly output of more quality-centric bands.\n\nListening to this album is a reasonably enjoyable experience, if you disregard the fact that you could be spending your time listening to something more worthwhile, but it really hasn\u2019t stood the test of time outside of its NWOBHM context. If anything, the music here veers away from the speedy heavy metal sound that was finally coming together in earlier songs like \u2018Heavy Metal Thunder\u2019 and retreats into overly familiar, Led Zeppelinesque hard rock for the most part. Saxon\u2019s artistic integrity seems to be fairly low, as every interesting feature \u2013 a pleasant guitar solo here or nice use of vocal harmony there \u2013 is instantly negated by blatant attempts at popularity. This wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the band wasn\u2019t so insistent on its rebellious, back-streets image, best expressed in the punk angst of \u2018Play it Loud.\u2019\n\nBill Bryford\u2019s vocals earn the accolade of actually being distinctive, despite imitating the alternating wails and groans of every other band of the time, but the other musicians aren\u2019t particularly notable. The twin guitars of Graham Oliver and Paul Quinn do nothing new and exciting, especially in contrast to the triumphant dual guitar melodies produced by every notable heavy metal band of the decade. The only instance of drums that stands out is the slow, plodding march of the title song. \u2018Denim and Leather,\u2019 the song, is a run-of-the-mill stadium anthem, but by its own low standards it actually manages to impress. Even outside of the catchiness of the chorus \u2013 which conjures in my mind, for some reason, a literal melting pot of torn jeans and beaten leather jackets being brewed in an attempt to capture the essence of heavy metal through clothing \u2013 the unoriginal leading riff is quite cool, and it\u2019s quite nice to hear the chanting of fans fading in at the end to lead out the album.\n\nThe lyrics are pretty silly but nicely optimistic, as Bryford tells you to think positive and become a singer like him, embracing the life of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. It\u2019s the kind of song that makes you realise how sterile it is to judge music based on artistic merit rather than the simple feeling it generates, and the way it can inspire these feelings in an entire generation\u2019s sub-culture. But then you listen to one of the dozens of better albums that were released the same year that accomplishes exactly the same thing, and cast Saxon aside like the pointless underdog it ever shall be.\n",
        "\nSaxon has been around for a long time, and I can't say I'm well-versed in their lenghthly discography. This is their 2007 output, and it's grown on me quite a bit. I was going to give it about 10 points lower, but I've come to appreciate this album. A lot of the songs are straightforward and rocking, such as \"State of Grace\", \"Need For Speed\", \"I've Got to Rock\", and \"Going Nowhere Fast\", all of which are packed with heavy, rocking riffs and melodic solos. \"Red Star Falling\" and \"Attila the Hun\" are the best songs here, very epic-feeling actually, especially the former. I also like \"Let Me Feel Your Power\" quite a lot, with it's catchy chorus and speedy guitar assault.\n\nBut I can't bring myself to like those vocals. Peter \"Biff\" Byford has been singing for 30+ years now, and I think it's finally catching up to him. I kept trying to like them, but Byford's voice has not aged as well as Bruce Dickinson's or Kai Hansen's in the new millenium, for his vox are the weakest link on this otherwise good heavy metal album.\n\nThis album is very solid all around, and not many of the songs jumped out at me at first, but I've grown to appreciate it as such---a solid heavy metal album, and nothing more. All of the songs are fun, rocking tunes that you'd be likely to listen to in a car speeding down the highway at night. Despite a few changes to their sound (a darker overall feel to it, as demonstrated in \"State of Grace\", and then the epic \"Red Star Falling\" and \"Attila the Hun\"), this is classic 80s-style heavy metal. Fans of the genre will enjoy. Recommended.\n",
        "\nAt the end of the 1970's, heavy metal was still in its fledgling years. For the most part, it was spearheaded by to Birmingham bands, Black Sabbath and Judas Priest. But as the 70's became the 80's, metal would have its first breakthrough in Britain. This new wave of British heavy metal bands practicing their trade (creatively titled NWOBHM \u2013 or \u2013 New Wave of British Heavy Metal) combined the British metal of the 70's and the punk rock or the time which controlled the UK's music scene at the time. It was here that metal would truly take off, as hundreds of bands popped out of seemingly anywhere. Of the hundreds of bands that gave the industry a shot, four of them gained a major foothold in the scene. Those four bands were Angel Witch, Def Leppard, Saxon, and of course Iron Maiden. Though each of the four bands would take a different career path, they all recorded albums in 1980 (being Iron Maiden, Wheels of Steel, Angel Witch, On Through the Night) which today are considered to not only be important to the development of heavy metal, but also some of NWOBHM's top works. Wheels of Steel was Saxon's second full length album, and is seen as one of the band's strongest efforts.\n\nLike many of their NWOBHM counterparts, Saxon's efforts on Wheels of Steel are raw, fist pumping offerings. Energy is the name of Saxon's game, and they make use of this valuable asset quite well. Numbers such as 747 (Strangers in the Night) and the title track use this to their advantage, creating a mid to fast paced adventure for fans of the band to immerse themselves in. There's a very good reason for why Saxon garnered so much acclaim with their sophomore effort, and the solid, consistent rhythms that produce the riffy, yet accessible tunes can be considered one of the major catalysts. Virtually every song contains at least one moment where the Quinn/Oliver guitar tandem shows off their rhythmic talents. Indeed, the riffs create one of the more memorable aspects of the band's music; will be remembered days after listening to the album. For the most part, the different instrumental aspects of the album are quite simple, as is the standard of NWOBHM music, but this does not take away from the music at all, really. Saxon isn't the most impressive band musically, but they're a helluva lot of fun to blare through a stereo.\n\nBut the most impressive part of Saxon's attack is by far vocalist Bliff Byford. This powerful singing often sets the tone of the music, whether it be through a strong, proud chorus or a melodic effort in the verses. By far my favourite performance by Byford on Wheels of Steel occurs during the chorus of 747. Very calm concentrated, yet energetic and determined at the same time, Bliff steals the spotlight from the guitarists not only as he sings \" We were strangers in the night / Both on separate flights / Strangers in the night (x2) / Lost on separate flights / Going nowhere\", but also on tracks such as Suzie Hold On or the title track, Wheels of Steel. Yes, the melodic, yet raw, clean yet rough style of Bliff Byford is most definitely Saxon's greatest strength, and most impressive member.\n\nThough perhaps not one of metal's best albums, Wheels of Steel is still a very worthwhile album. Through driving rhythms, impressive vocal deliveries, and infectious leads, Saxon has succeeded in creating an 39 minute album full of early metal anthems that metal and hard rock fans alike can rock out to. Wheels of Steel was Saxon's breakthrough album and assured that like some of their counterparts, Iron Maiden, Diamond Head, or Angel Witch for instance, they would be remembered years down the road. Unlike today, where the majority of bands attempt live off of the successes of their latest albums for a few years, Saxon did not sit back. Instead they headed right back to the studio to record their third album in to years, Strong Arm of the Law, which was greeted with similar praise as Wheels of Steel. This is a great album, and I would definitely recommend it to fans of rock and metal.\n\nOriginally written for Sputnikmusic\n",
        "\nDo you know how many uninteresting/lousy hard rock bands were treading water in \u201979? If you were to leaf through countless boxes of records dating from that time, your fingers would be as black as the chances of 90% of the bands to become anything even remotely celebrated. Some had been scraping by for years, jaded enough by now to know their hometown wasn\u2019t going to be hanging \u201cJackassville \u2013 home of\u2026\u201d banners at the entrances any time soon. Others grooved wax for the first time, optimistically, possibly even with thoughts of future red carpets unrolling in their heads. Actually, 90% is a touch generous. How about 3% of all the material released in that time was actually going places worth the bus fare. But besides this bleakness, bands trudged onward, labels small and large took chances on bands that may have had just the charisma, just the magnetism, and maybe enough talent to be the next Van Halen or Foreigner, or for the more realistic, the next Status Quo or Y&T. \n\nSo there\u2019s Saxon, a John Doe in line with all the rest, throwing demos and handing show billings to any exec that\u2019ll listen. Oh look, some German band called Accept got picked up by Brain. And there\u2019re the blokes in Samson. Hey, we\u2019ve played and partied with them before. And who\u2019s that, Hellix? Oh, Helix. But low and behold, here comes a suit from Carrere with a pile of papers and a smile, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going anywhere. \n\nBut unlike many waiting on that same line, they did go somewhere. Maybe they didn\u2019t leave skid marks like Maiden would a year later, but managed to become a more conspicuous fixture than Praying Mantis and the aforementioned Helix and Samson, and their two and a half decade regime began without their better-known, more steely \u201cPrincess of the Night\u201d resonance. \n\nIf I still have to explain to you where metal was in \u201979, you deserve a slap, but not before heart-racers like \u201cStallions of the Highway\u201d, \u201cBacks to the Wall\u201d, and \u201cFrozen Rainbow\u201d sidewind unwittingly with a diminutive, country-less din that will soon be regarded as the launching pad to a style of rock that\u2019ll take on a more massive tensile strength in time to come. In that light, the metal component in Saxon\u2019s debut is very limited, splurging with a less purposive, more accidental uprising of harder tone, secret implication and a nifty flare that\u2019s still essentially hard rock any way you crush it, but has a fluency that is the stone tablets of the future NWOBHM sound. In a nutshell, the debut from Saxon is one of the very few seamless seams attaching the genres. Sure, in hindsight it\u2019s pretty clear, but then it was just a few interesting steps past the norm, and little did they know something else was going on. Yeah, Maiden may be honored as the genre\u2019s shining light, but their debut is less subtle in its tying of the styles (which is a fair reason why it's more accepted in metal circles). And to give an example of how merely moderately metallic the debut's material is, some of the stuff on Boston\u2019s debut isn't as nimble as this, but the guitar tone is twice as heavy, and has Boston ever in your wildest dreams been considered a metal band? \n\nSurprisingly, slower, steadier songs are few and far between. The peppy \u201cBig Teaser\u201d, the quasi-Kiss-esque \u201cStill Fit to Boogie\u201d, coolly gliding \u201cMilitia Guard\u201d and their faster brethren easily outdistance the two more conventional tracks on the disk, one of which bravely switches places with the more obvious album opener \u201cFrozen Rainbow\u201d for a mild curveball, and \u201cRainbow Theme\u201d, the song itself a far cry from one of your show-\u2018em-what-you\u2019re-made-of type of tunes, manages to hold the line with some cool hauntingly impassioned rhythms, a warm-blooded blues-inspired solo, and a minor flair for the epic the other tracks rarely draw upon. The singer with the silly name changes his voice according to the song. Lively falsetto lives during most of the faster tracks, but with something like \u201cRainbow Theme\u201d he pulls the tone down to earth for a more customary approach which I feel is even more impressive yet. The lengthy \u201cMilitia Guard\u201d strides along nicely, marching militantly into an abrupt, oddly strong acoustic roadblock and then into the meat of the song that\u2019s not as exuberant as it is catchy. \n\nEven if this had been released sometime in late \u201980, this album would still be more the bridge to the musical species than just about any other album released at that time. The sound this created isn\u2019t about timing, but about the sound itself. Just so happens Saxon hit that dead on as well. And in regards as to how this four-piece persevered beyond most of their peers, all someone had to do was listen and recognize the promise; the possible songwriting strength that was clandestinely hugging curves on a highway that was pretty much one lane. Then tell a friend. Hell, they may do it even better with the next release. \n\nThis is the album the band should be most proud of.\n",
        "\nOkay, let\u2019s get a few things straight here from the band's past career; Wheels Of Steel was a groundbreaking heavy metal album that was full of fast riffs and a hard attitude, with a formula that was perfected with their follow up album of the same year, Strong Arm Of The Law. With two classics and three albums already, the band showed no signs of slowing down. 1981\u2019s Denim And Leather is probably the most METAL album ever released, lyrically speaking. It\u2019s is very hard hitting indeed. Power And The Glory did manage to top it though, coming off as a Metal masterpiece in my opinion. It wasn\u2019t until 1997\u2019s Unleash The Beast album, that Saxon even came close to the quality and Metalness of Power And The Glory, although this time around, the band was harder and heavier than ever! Think they couldn\u2019t have possibly topped that? Well you\u2019re wrong! Unleash The Beast was only a taste of what the band would now become.... \n\n1999\u2019s Metalhead album is Saxon at their heaviest, darkest, fastest and hardest! This entire album is cloaked in dark atmosphere, with riffs that are heavier than an anvil being thrown off the grand canyon. This totally makes up for the living abortions that were Destiny and Rock The Nations, or even Innocence Is No Excuse for that matter. This also blows Unleash The Beast out of the fucking water and towers over any track that appeared on Power And The Glory, except for the title track and Warrior, of course. The only reason that this album is less impressive than the early 80s releases is because the early albums were clearly ahead of their time. This one, on the other hand, sounds almost as if it came out of the 80s itself, released in 1999, but hey, at least Saxon is back to their Heavy Metal roots, still kicking ass and going strong. I\u2019ve often heard this album compared to modern German Power Metal bands like Pegazus, Iron Savior, Metallium, Primal Fear and bands like that, yet I don\u2019t see why! This sounds nothing like those bands since it\u2019s obviously heavier, much darker, and a lot less upbeat. It also doesn\u2019t focus on constant double bassing and shitty usage of triggers on the drums to achieve speed, much like these German Power Metal bands do nowadays. So if you think that this is anything remotely close to that modern, generic, German Power Metal, then fuck you!\n\n1. Intro - MUCH less impressive than any of the intros that the band previously did, but it\u2019s good none the less. It has this sort of \u201cfuturistic\u201d atmosphere to it, leading us right into the title track\u2026\n\n2. Metalhead - Wow, is this HEAVY or what?! Yes, this is HEAVY in all caps!!! I\u2019ve never even heard Doom Metal that was this heavy! This song is reeking with dark atmosphere, and once again, Biff provides his low sung vocals for added mood, helping with the darkness of the song. In the background, you can sometimes hear a demonic voice growling \u201cMETAL! HEAD!\u201d, which once again, helps bring to the dark vibe to the listener and only makes this song sound heavier. Overall, it isn\u2019t very fast, but so what? This rules, plain and simple!\n\n3. Are We Travelers In Time - This one is much in the same tone as Metalhead, complete with riffs are HEAVY as hell, dark, low, melodic vocals and mid paced speed that is quite easy to headbang to. Once again, the atmosphere is very dark and mystical, and is not very easy to listen to if you\u2019re looking for upbeat Metal. By the way, I think both of these tracks are about life in outer space. I know for sure Metalhead is, but I\u2019m not so sure about this one. Must be, just look at the title.\n\n4. Conquistador - These opening acoustics are really cool. It sounds like music from out of ancient Spain, which of course, is when this track lyrically takes place. Looking for speed? Well then this song should please you. Don\u2019t mistake this for being upbeat though, because it does still have that dark vibe to it, it\u2019s just much faster than the previous two songs and much more melodic. Biff displays incredible vocal range here, making his voice catchy as fuck while still singing in a low tone, occasionally hitting a high note when the time is right. The acoustics are also used during the chorus, which in my opinion, was a great idea to do. They really add to its catchiness, and let me tell you\u2026I don\u2019t think Saxon has ever done a better chorus! Seriously, this song absolutely SLAYS from start to finish! And you know what? This is probably my favorite Saxon tune. Or one of them for sure.\n\n5. What Goes Around - Once again, we\u2019re back to the mid paced heavy stuff, and these riffs truly CRUSH! Okay, so this isn\u2019t as heavy as the album\u2019s title track or Travelers In Time, but occasionally, you\u2019ll hear this riff that\u2019s like\u2026\u201dDamn! That\u2019s pretty heavy!\u201d. I guess it\u2019s a little less impressive overall than the previous three songs, but is sure as hell is not a filler song. Also, Biff sings in his usual, normal ranged tone this time around. \n\n6. Song Of Evil - So, this is the song of evil, eh? It sure as hell sounds like it too!! Biff\u2019s voice doesn\u2019t sound dark, it just sounds plain out angry mean as hell! And these riffs\u2026whoa! HEAVY! It\u2019s safe to say that the overall atmosphere heard here is darker than anything on the rest of this album, meaning that it\u2019s also safe to say that it truly deserves to be called the \u2018Song Of Evil\u2019. These lyrics rule too: \u201cThe smell of death surrounds you, your souls will burn in Hell. The final retribution when Satan rings the bell\u201d. Yes, this rules! Plain and simple!\n\n7. All Guns Blazing - No, this isn\u2019t a Judas Priest cover, but it sure as hell gives the Priest track some serious competition with intensity and speed. To call this song Speed Metal is probably one of the biggest understatements I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire life! And no, that is not an exaggeration. Biff\u2019s vocals are top notch here, flowing very well with the music while maintaining great range, both during the verses and the chorus. And these riffs\u2026damn! There are a lot of them and every single one of them slays the other before! That double bass break out towards the end of the song sounds badass as well.\n\n8. Prisoner - This one\u2019s very similar to What Goes Around, except for the fact that the vocals are a little darker. There are also better riffs to be heard, but the highlight is definitely the chorus. It\u2019s catchy, and is also one of those songs that is likely to stay nailed into the back of your skull for a very long time. \n\n9. Piss Off - Hah, I was just waiting for Saxon to make a song title like this. The riffs in this song contain the most groove to them out of all the tracks on the album. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re any less heavy than any of the other songs on here. Byford\u2019s vocals are also a bit more upfront and don\u2019t possess that dark vibe to them anymore, although there is some attitude to be heard within his voice as well. I mean, what else would you except with a song that\u2019s entitled \u2018Piss Off\u2019?\n\n10. Watching You - For some reason, this one sounds likes something off Unleash The Beast due to the riffs and vocals. They\u2019re not as heavy and/or dark as on the rest of the material off this album, yet this track manages to kick just as much ass as any track here. I guess with a song title like \u2018Watching You\u2019, one would probably except a song that sounded a little darker or a little more eerie, but hey, I have no problem with this one. I love the hell out of Unleash The Beast, so this song is truly a good one either way.\n\n11. Sea Of Life - Ah yes, it\u2019s now time for some experimentation from the band. Does that mean it\u2019s bad? NO! It\u2019s much more epic than the band\u2019s usual material and spans over 8 minutes long. It is also entirely mid paced, very heavy in some parts and acoustic/melodic in some of the other parts. These two elements work very well together. The highlight here though are the vocals without a doubt. Biff sings with such fantastic range, knowing just when to hit those notes that make this song do damn catchy and appealing. Overall, a very epic number that serves as a perfect closing track for the album.\n\n\nSaxon has always been a band that's contantly changing, yet still manges to stay true to their identity (with the exception of their shitty late 80s albums). This album is no exception. It isn't the classic Saxon that we all know, but that also isn't a bad thing either. Look at it this way; Metalhead is to Denim And Leather what Judas Priest's Painkiller is to British Steel. Then again, this is quite heavier than Painkiller and dreadfully dark as well. I guess you can call this Power Metal, because it sure has a lot of power behind it! A LOT! But don't mix up that term with what's referred to today as Power Metal, because this album sounds NOTHING like those bands! This is darker, far more original and overall heavier.\n\nNote: That's also why I don't know what the hell the reviewer below was thinking when he said that this sounded like german power metal. Because it doesn't!\n",
        "\nThis song is very nearly perfect. In fact, when its played live on The Eagle Has Landed it IS perfect, the extra speed is all it needs. Sorry Saxon, this version is just too slow to get 100%. But apart from that, it has a huge stomping riff that will blow you away in the verses which when, coupled with a quieter chorus and three fantastic solos, makes it possibly Saxon's best song ever. Biff's vocals are great, and perfectly timed to work with the big guitar chords- \"This is [BAM BA] Scandinavian 101 [da da dum]\". A ledgendary song from a ledgendary band.\n",
        "\nWheels Of Steel might sound somewhat dated and simplistic by today\u2019s standards, but remains an example of what traditional heavy metal is all about. It\u2019s direct, raw, melodic, loud and proud! Much more mature than the band\u2019s debut, it made Saxon really popular at the time and earned them a top 5 position in the UK charts.\nWheels Os Steel is the best Saxon album to this day and their heaviest of the 80s. Its sound was much harder and heavier than anyone at the time. Well except for Motorhead perhaps. Remember, it was February 1980 when it was released. At the same time it manages to be melodic, although driven by heavy guitar riffs.\nWhat puts Saxon aside is that they are unique. Even though they play traditional heavy metal they are pretty diverse lyrically. They don\u2019t sing about evil, witches, death and all that stuff. They are much more direct and closer to the listener, talking about motorcycles, street fighting gangs, an air-flight and much more, which makes them at least interesting. Someone might say that they are silly. I\u2019d say they are sincere and don\u2019t try to write \u2018thoughtful\u2019 lyrics because they are a heavy metal band and play simple, though inspired music.\nSo, what about the songs themselves? They are all really good, some of them standing out. The first track Motorcycle Man is a very aggressive and fast song. Pretty melodic, with nice solos. A suitable opener for the album. Street Fighting Gang and Stand Up And Be Counted are both fast and very melodic with great refrains and cool lyrics. Machine Gun has some excellent rhythms throughout (check out at 1:40) and good solos which make really interesting. 747 is the most melodic song and probably the best Saxon song. A live favorite, 747 features outstanding guitar work at the beginning followed by a great bridge/refrain, with very good lyrics and vocals. The album has no fillers and all the other tracks are perfect early 80s metal.\nSaxon\u2019s sound is very unique as I said (even Biff Byford\u2019s voice) and can\u2019t be compared to another band. You have to hear it yourself to decide. Saxon may not be the best players. They can\u2019t play very technical solos but they have the most powerful riffs. Biff may not be the best singer, but he sings his heart and lungs out. Just as the rest of the band, they give it all. And that\u2019s what heavy metal is all about, at least for me.\n",
        "\nWhat an excellent return to form by this long-lived band.\n\nOn this album the band have gone for a really head-on assault, and this is probably some of the heaviest stuff they have recorded. The riffs and drumming (courtesy of Stratovarius drummer Jorg Michael) are a real bludgeoning force, but delivered within the classic realms of melody and varoety that classifies Saxon's whole career.\n\nWhile earlier classics focus more on sing-along vocal elements - and very successfully - on this album the band have really introduced the guitars as a primary element, more so than in their earlier career. There are some top class riffs here, and a nice variety in styles as well.\n\nYou have the blistering headbangers like To Live By The Sword and Man and Machine, and then also more musing anthem tracks like the excellent title track and then Beyond the Grave for something more ballad-esque.\n\nThe point is, there is a lot of variety on this album, but without sacrificing the amount of metallica pummelling the listener receives! The band come at you from various different angles, the catchy vocals still binding all the songs together, and there is not really a bad song on here. Perhaps towards the end the utmost quality begins to fade, but there are worthwile moments to be had on this album right to the end.\n\nThe lyrics deal quite heavily with patriotic issues and English history, which is a really nice touch for me, and something that Saxon have set themselves up to stand for.\n\nHow people can claim to be dissapointed with this album puzzles me - it is quite possibly the most intense and consistently solid release I've heard from them, and there are plenty of riffs, plenty of solos and plenty of cathy tunes to stick in the memory, whatever your specific tastes.\n\nDefinitely worth chasing, this is an extremely enjoyable album!\n",
        "\nI mean, you like heavy fucking metal? I don't see why you would not dig this. Do fans of symphonic Hollywood metal dig Rhapsody? Same logic. \n\nThis album is commonly viewed as the first part of their late 90's \"resurrection\" or whatever you'd like to call it. Anyway, it displays a much rejuvenated Saxon in comparison to some of their mid-80's - mid-90's works, where, at best, the consistency was seriously lacking. For example, the two first tracks on the previous album, 'Dogs of War', completely rule (especially the title track), but the rest of the album is, if I'm to believe all the reports, more or less a fluke. \n\nNow, on this album, the consistency just so happens to be one the main selling points. Actually, not even the classics (Wheels, Strong Arm, Denim) were thoroughly consistent; in fact, the weak stuff from those three combined would probably be enough make up a really bad best-of compilation - this album, however, manages to be exactly 90% consistent (discounting the intro, there are ten tracks, do the math), which is quite impressive when you take into account that the old stuff reached maybe 70% tops in that area. \n\nBut let's not forget: when those albums were good - man were they dead fucking on. \"Motorcycle Man\", \"Machine Gun\", \"Heavy Metal Thunder, \"Strong Arm of the Law\" \"Princess of the Night\" to name a few - timeless, untouchable heavy metal classics and even moreso if you're strictly talking about the NWOBHM scene. That's where this album falls a bit short - only one song on here really belongs among those songs, and although two others come pretty close, the trade-off for increased consistency appears to be a decrease in the number of TOTAL fucking stand-out tracks. So this album probably ends up receiving a rating similar to that of the classics, as it's pros and cons even it out. \n\nBut disregarding quality, how does it compare to Saxon of the old, in overall style? To start with, the rock n' roll-ish vibe that was largely evident on earlier albums is just about dead and buried here. No boogie-woogie tinged stuff like \"Stand Up and Be Counted\" or even something bluesy like \"Strong Arm of the Law\" - this is just straight-up heavy metal all-around. Even when the occasional old-school rock riff comes through, it's still played in a total metal fashion so that you don't even take notice of it. \n\nThe next thing is that there is a much \"darker\" vibe to everything; for example, there's hardly anything along the lines of light-hearted stuff like \"To Hell and Back Again\" (arguably an important staple for the development of power metal) on here. The production may have something do with this...but a number of songs seem pretty dark and moody in the first place, something that was never quite evident on the early albums. \n\nOh yeah, THE PRODUCTION - now let's not forget about that part. As you can expect, the sound is completely modernized - the guitars are downtuned, as well a very evident full-on metal crunch to them and the drums carry a bigger punch. Now, this description fits just about every single new metal band coming out today, which unfortunately often results in many bands ending up sounding very similar - but THIS production job somehow manages to completely stand out. While the playing is pretty tight and precise, it doesn't sound mechanical and/or lifeless at all - a problem a lot of other bands struggle with, especially the ones who let Roy Z inside the studio! 'Resurrection' (the album), this is not. The rather thrashy drum sound probably adds a bit to the \"liveliness\", as the hi-hat is often kept pretty loose. Somewhat comparable in sound is Running Wild's 'Black Hand Inn', because it has just that slightly \"deep\" tone, while still being totally crunchy and intense, although this album is probably a bit less slick. \n \nAs for the only two remaining musicians from the classic line-up, Biff Byford is unmistakably still Biff Byford - his voice isn't quite like anyone else's, even though he has a somewhat lower and deeper voice on this release (like the guitars), perhaps due to age or just to fit in with the \"darker\" sound. Also, Paul Quinn's leads are pretty evident, I believe; at least I think it's him playing a large part of the solos, as many of them are very old-school in nature and do a good job of recalling Saxon of the old. A very competent job for sure, not aged in the least bit. \n\nTo go more into detail, namely into describing the songs, what we have here is some extremely catchy material (aided by the production, of course, but anyway...). Most songs exhibit the simple, direct, punchy, balls-out and to-the-point. Everything sounds pretty fresh, as it's a new and fresh style they're working with; while the style is pretty familiar, nothing feels overly rehashed and this was before metal's big comeback had REALLY come through (or is that era still awaiting us?). \n\nLet's start with the best: \"Terminal Velocity\". This song completely and totally rocks - simple ideas are at work and this song resembles old Saxon more than most songs on here as it's a bit on the rockish side riffage-wise (absolutely nothing wrong with that), but again, the metal-ness of the playing is undeniable. What is truly to be revered, however, is the flat-out AMAZING execution and construction of it - if you're talking about some of the most \"well-done\" songs of all time, this one definitely ends up in my top five. This is absolute and utter perfection - from the insanely cool little lead fills to the soaring and attitude-filled vocal lines, I cannot possibly rave enough about it, as that could fill half of my review. \"Heavy Metal Thunder\", \"Princess of the Night\", any other classics, step aside, because this seriously tops anything else they've written up to this point and that is saying a lot, you all know. The solo owns too...bah, I'll just stop there; this songhas to be heard to be believed anyway. \n\nNow, I would have given this album a higher score had I reviewed it after maybe two listens, but some tracks on here suffer from the \"catchy but gets old quickly\" syndrome that so many other songs out there suffer from. \"Terminal Velocity\" manages to be both catchy AND good for hundreds of listens - many of the other songs aren't even as good to begin with PLUS they tend to get a bit old after about four listens. This especially concerns the slower stuff, like \"Cut Out the Disease\" and \"The Preacher\", both having a nice and thick atmosphere. \n\nMany tracks check in as just plain \"solid\", including \"All Hell Breaking Loose\", \"Bloodletter\" (two songs that probably resemble old Saxon more than any others), \"Circle of Light\" (another atmospheric but heavy number, with an intro that's totally out of Accept's \"Midnight Mover\") and \"Ministry of Fools\". That last song is a bit of a surprise - this sounds like a mix between Judas Priest's \"Parental Guidance\" (note: from 'Turbo') and Poison's \"Cry Tough\". I find this song rather \"happy\" and party-hearty musically, even though the lyrics, as indicated by the title, deal with random anti-government stuff. This song therefore sticks out a bit from the rest of the album, but it ain't bad in any way and it's still metal as fuck (but every time I listen to it, images of ENORMOUS goddamn hair awake nonetheless!). Oh yeah, and even the album's intro \"Gothic Dreams\" is damn solid too, arguably even a bit of a waste of a fitting intro to something bigger...\n\nComing in right behind the top track on here is the title track and \"The Thin Red Line\". The former is a very fast and intense speed metal number with excellent riffs and melodies everywhere - textbook stuff, basically. At first I found myself a little put off by the chorus, as it completely drops the snare drum and thus the whole pace for a few seconds, but later I've come to enjoy it a lot more and now I actually think of it as a nice \"innovation\" more than anything else - and the chorus does indeed have a pretty fucking nice melody. The latter song is a bit experimental - midpaced and epic, perhaps a little in the vein of \"Crusader\" even though this doesn't sound anything like it otherwise. The vocals are especially awesome, both in the verse and chorus: \"They'll be coming in the morning boys - you gotta hold the line!!\" and \"You came for the glory, to fight and to die!!\" Fuck yeah!! It's 6.20 and feels like 4 blank, almost TOO short for a song of that caliber! (On a sidenote: what's up with those random \"war\" noises in the beginning? I can't tell if it's a bunch of marching soldiers, a helicopter or even a train, it sounds like a mix between all three!!)\n\nA completely worthwhile album. By far one of the best \"rejuvenations\" ever to happen - you know you're good when you can write stuff that is on par with your old stuff, 16 years later. \n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot that track at number 10...namely the remaining 10%. Well, let's just say that it's an acoustic ballad, that it's a tribute to a friend of theirs who passed away and that it makes \"Watching Over Me\" sound like \"Painkiller\". It can actually be argued that this album is just as inconsistent as the stuff of the old because of this one track...because it's like if you combined the forces of all the weak tracks they ever put out on EVERY album before this one, creating this absolute fucking disasterpiece of a track (either that or that bad best-of album I mentioned earlier;)). It's really that terrible...I am at a loss of words for describing it more in detail, it just seems so absurd having 9 more or less owning tracks and then getting this. At least 'Something Wicked This Way Comes' followed a constant \"mediocre thrasher/crappy ballad\" pattern, never rising above said mediocrity. \n\nBut skip that one and you get one of the most consistent Saxon albums ever made, and again; being able to kick this much ass after some 20 years in business is definitely admirable. They've still got it and of course Lemmy is still God. Oh wait, wrong band. \"Long live the Saxon\", then.\n",
        "\nOne of the pioneering bands of true British heavy metal, along with such giants as Judas Priest and (in my opinion to a lesser extent) Iron Maiden, is of course Saxon. Although they're supposed to have had a more glammy period (which I haven't heard much of at all, so I wouldn't know - this is just what I've been told), 2001's \"Killing Ground\" marks a release for this band that might as well have been the follow-up to \"Wheels of Steel\" or \"Strong Arm of the Law\". Soaring riffs of classic British style, packed with power chords and tasteful licks, mixed with a quite modern production, which on this one - unlike on their latest, \"Lionheart\" - is done really fucking well, and gives the album a crisp, clean sound and very inspiring; not at all as shallow as \"Lionheart\" sometimes sounds.\n\nThe songwriting is also far more inspired and powerful. While there are a few fillers (\"Running For The Border\", \"You Don't Know What You've Got\"), even these have some pretty damn nifty riffs and solos. And the good stuff is total vintage Saxon.\n\"Killing Ground\" is one of the best Saxon songs ever, in fact. The riffwork is fucking HEAVY. The main riff chugs along efficiently and forces you to headbang, with some more melodic but still heavy stuff for the verses for a perfect epic mood, and Biff's vocal performance is out of this world. \"Together we stand, divided we fall! On the killing ground!\" Total utter ownage.\nThe second ultra-highlight on here is \"Deeds of Glory\", which has some very catchy riffage all through, and stars out as a regular Saxon asskicker, and then bursts into that glorious chorus. Man, oh man, that's good stuff.\n\nOther highlights.. \"Coming Home\" almost feels like filler, in being a song that's just kinda 'there' and doesn't stand out much, but it still manages to do what it does very well. The main riff is kinda light, but coupled with the simplistic but effective drumming it works really well along with a more laid-back vocal delivery. Kinda mellow song all over, but really, really good.\n\n\"Hell Freezes Over\" is excellent too, with an almost AC/DC-like main riff, but more epic, and strong lyrics about going against the grain. And Biff Byford shines on this song as well as all the rest, giving all the material insane amounts of power. \"Dragon's Lair\" must also be mentioned - total speed/power metal, but totally sans-cheese. Headbanging madness combined with fun fantasy lyrics, and it's given a nice atmosphere with the reverby vocals. The chorus idea works very well too, the lead guitar repeating Biff's vocal melody.\n\nAlso, the closing track \"Rock Is Our Life\" is glorious metal-praising goodness done perfectly. That classic main melody always gives me goosebumps, and the song is filled with banging riffs, a glorious singalong chorus of highest quality and a spectacular solo. What the hell else do you need? It's songs like this that make me proud to be a metalhead.\n\n\nThere isn't really a bad song on here though, it's all excellent stuff. The two epic ballads, \"Court of the Crimson King\" and \"Shadows on The Wall\" are a bit weird, especially the latter with the pretty shitty distorted vocal parts, but for the most part they both work very well. The first stands out the most, with a strong main riff and heavy middle section.\n\nThis is definitely an essential release for any Saxon fan, or any metalhead in general who want to reminisce the old days of the early 80s and Saxon in their prime. And the best part is that even though it sounds as classic as any early Saxon album, it doesn't sound like they're even trying to be nostalgic - they're just still doing their thing, unaffected by modern trends, which is seen in too few bands these days.\nThe highlight of the band still remains vocalist Biff Byford, who in these days of over-the-top ball-less power metal opera singers and harsh frostbitten churchburner wannabes, stands as one of the most powerful vocalists in the metal scene of today, just as he was at the top of his game way back in the day.\nHe's also backed up by some excellent musicians, who just works together extremely well, to create a classic of modern heavy metal.\n",
        "\nThis is one of my most favourite heavy metal albums of all time beyond doubt. The album grabs your skull and bangs it with an iron fist and doesn't let go. \n\nAs I said before, the title track, er, kicks your ass, and really depicts the whole aspect of the album: heavy metal, swift and hard. . Great riff, intensive combined with Biff's vocals make it a truly amazing song. Probably the best track on the whole album. \n\nTo Hell And Back Again is a great song too. The chorus is great, and Biff shows again what a great singer he is. \n\nStrong Arm Of The Law slows down a bit, but attacks with strong lyrics and a great solo, instead of fast riffing and drumming. Thumbs up! Taking Your Chances and 20,000 feet both have a great melody and vocals with amazing riffs. They both have choruses capable of blowing your head up.\n\nHungry Years, while being not so fast as the other songs, is great. A bit hard rockish though, but who cares? Once my friend said Saxon was about making AC/DC faster and adding a bit more balls to Bon Scott, perhaps he wasn't so wrong, was he? :-)\n\nThe two last songs are sweet too, although not as great as the other songs on the album. Still, without them, the album wouldn't be so great. \n\nIf you like heavy metal, heard Judas Priest and are eager to hear more good stuff from the UK -- get this. It's atleast worth a try!\n",
        "\n\"Crusader\" makes a swift turn in Saxon's direction (Well, I haven't heard \"Power & The Glory\" so I'm not counting that one). From raw, catchy and true NWOBHM they turn to a more rock n' roll direction, blasting out easy-on-the-ears rockers like \"Rock City\", \"Bad Boys (Like To Rock N' Roll)\" and \"A Little Bit Of What You Fancy\". So while this doesn't exactly have the same vicious attitude as you'd find on, say, \"Wheels of Steel\", this does feature some very catchy and memorable songwriting, fairly simplistic but well-done riffing and just a whole lot of fun air guitaring action.\n\nThough one song stands way above the rest - Crusader, the lord of the realm! My god, this OWNS. OWNSOWNSOWNS. Epic as fuck, insanely powerful, and the atmosphere is just out of this world. Biff's vocal performance is divine, the mid-paced melodic riffing is huge, and everything is just awesome.\nAnd then, when the solo kicks in... that's easily the best guitar solo in Saxon and one of those where true metal enthusiasts like me just go into complete ecstasy until it's entirely over. Every note seems incredibly thought out and the solo just gets better every second. Absolutely orgasmic.\nAnd it goes on for the remainder of the song, even for the last powerful, soaring \"Fight the good fight! Believe what is right! Crusader, lord of the realm!\" That is one of the most powerful endings to any song in metal ever, and owns beyond belief.\n\n\nOkay, so I fellated over one song for like half the review, but that song alone makes this album worth getting even if you hate the other stuff. But fortunately for me, I dig the rest as well. \"A Little Bit Of What You Fancy\" is catchy as hell and a blast to sing along to, same with \"Bad Boys (Like To Rock N' Roll)\" and \"Rock City\".\n\"Just Let Me Rock\" is a pretty cool, bluesy number with a simple but effective power chord-chorus. Oh yeah, and the cover of The Sweet's \"Set Me Free\" totally owns.\n\nThere are two ballads on here, \"Sailing To America\" and \"Do It All For You\". The first is just incredibly boring, to be honest, and shall not be spoken of again. The second is quite alright though, and that opening melody sounds like vintage Iron Maiden shit.\n\n\nAll in all, a damn fun, solid album with one of the band's top 5 songs ever for a title track. Yup, this rocks.\n",
        "\nThe second studio release from Saxon is every bit as legendary as it possibly gets. A milestone among the NWOBHM scene and metal in general, and standing as the superior album of 1980, above albums such as \"British Steel\" and \"Iron Maiden\". With raging riffs often nodding to the fury of total speed metal, incredible solo sections of truest heavy metal style, and the soaring vocals of frontman Biff Byford, this goes in to kick your ass and doesn't fail in the least.\n\nThe sound is rawer than on most Saxon albums, and doesn't sound as refined as their masterpiece \"Denim And Leather\", which here works really fucking well. Songs like \"Stand Up Be Counted\" and \"Street Fighting Gang\" start out with furious main riffs with an absolutely fucking vicious sound and guitar tone. These two songs are not often mentioned when talking about this album, but I fucking love em!\n\"Stand Up And Be Counted\" is standard upbeat early 80s Saxon which means total ownage. A very catchy main riff and inspiring vocals, and it peaks at a vicious chorus - a superb guitar melody duals with Biff's excellent vocal work.\n\"Street Fighting Gang\" is more aggressive, with lyrics that basically say \"fuck school, let's go kick someone's ass!\" Hell yeah. This band in their early 80s defined what Heavy Metal is all a bout.\n\n\nThis album just never lets up, and is a nonstop ride to metal heaven showing no speed limits. This has more classics than any other Saxon album, pretty much. Opening track \"Motorcycle Man\" is definitely among Saxon's top 10 material. Just kickass, catchy speed metal with tons of attitude. Same with the short but sweet \"Freeway Mad\" and monstrously insane closing track \"Machine Gun\". Like Boris said, this is fucking crazy for it's time.\nAnd of course, \"747\". We all know this one - the huge mood changes and atmosphere it creates while rocking hard at the same time. An undeniable classic, and one of the band's most well known tracks, although it's ten times better live. And then we mustn't forget the title track. \"Wheels of Steel\" is about cruising down the freeway, ignoring the speed limits and taking no shit. It rides pretty much two riffs for about five minutes, but somehow manages not to get boring - only Saxon and Priest could pull something like that off.\n\nI can't go without mentioning the remaining two songs as well - \"See The Light Shining\" brings some more catchy fast riffage but is a bit more melodic and laid-back than the rest. It also features a very nice breakdown towards the middle. Then we have \"Suzie Hold On\", definitely the best Saxon ballad I've heard. It's a ballad, but still has some damn nice riffs and a brilliant lead section in the middle.\n\n\nShould you get this? I don't know, are you metal? If so, you already own it. \"Wheels of Steel\", while not quite the catchy heavy metal monster that is \"Denim And Leather\", is a metal record with punch, and is a hard kick in the nuts to all poseurs out there. Long live heavy fucking metal!\n",
        "\nSaxon's latest effort in a looong line of studio records is definitely not among their classics. The reason? Well, I'd say one word more especially describes why this album falls short, somewhat.... Generic. Predictable, uninspired riff constructions in the style of Primal Fear's weaker tracks, appear on a bunch of the tracks that end up being labeled as total filler. I'll start with bitching about those.\n\nThe second track, \"Man And Machine\", lacks any sort of passion or inspiration. Generic guitarwork reeking of the more riff-heavy bands of the Euro power metal scene, and completely uninteresting vocal lines, which leaves you wondering what happened to the band who made the ridiculously catchy \"Denim And Leather\" and \"Motorcycle Man\", or how about \"Rock Is Our Life\" from the \"Killing Ground\" album? Total loser of a track.\n\nThe closing track \"Flying On The Edge\" is just more of the same uninspired crap, and \"Beyond The Grave\" is just ridiculous, over-melodic and lame.\n\"Searching For Atlantis\" is also a bit of a filler track, though it has kinda grown on me in time. A balladic tune with some pretty inice chugging riffage under the mellow verses provide some interesting stuff. Not great, but not too bad either.\n\nBut aside from this, must of the stuff is pretty good. Opening track \"Witchfinder General\" is probably the best song on here, and could be compared to the top material on \"Killing Ground\". Similar riffstyle to the filler tracks, but here they totally nail and master that style, and give Primal Fear a hard kick in the sternum. Coupled with an awesome vocal delivery (Biff Byford still rocks after all these years) and incredibly punchy, powerful vocal lines, this song is a total winner.\n\nShortly after, we go a little power metal with the keyboard driven \"The Return\", a nicely executed epic intro to the title track, \"Lionheart\", which is further ownage.\nEpic true metal in the vein of \"Crusader\", with very nicely done though somewhat generic under-verse guitar melodies providing a strong atmosphere together with powerful vocal lines, and then goes into that awesome chorus.\nDamn nice middle section also, getting heavier and heavier until it somewhat abruptly takes us back into the melodic verse. Great stuff.\n\nOf the remaining stuff, it's mostly kinda average modern Saxon stuff. A nod to the modern euro power scene in some of the riffwork though a bit heavier than that stuff. Sometimes they do it well, but occasionally it does get rather uninventive, and it feels like something's missing.\nHowever, songs like \"Justice\" and \"To Live By The Sword\" (Ninja metal!) does it really good, and exceed most other Saxon songs in heaviness, some of the riffs almost bordering on speed/thrash. Almost.\n\n\"English Man'O'war\" (Pirate metal!) is also damn good. Crashing power chords and soaring vocals presenting a nice image of a battle by sea, the cannons pounding holes in the wooden hull, or something like that. Very cool.\nOh yeah, and the acoustic \"Jack Tars\" which leads into it rules too. Jolly jack tars, brave men and all! Word.\n\nThough the highlights here are definitely \"Witchfinder General\", \"Lionheart\" and the speedy \"To Live By The Sword\". Insane riffage on that one, and also an outrageously catchy chorus. And the middle section is fucking orgasmic - Biff Byford > j00.\nGreat stuff here, showing that Saxon definitely haven't lost their touch, despite some weaker moments on this album.\n\nAll in all, \"Lionheart\" honestly doesn't live up to my expectations of one of my top 5 bands, but still a worthy addition to your Saxon collection, especially if you get the limited edition with the kickass patch on it. I have mine proudly shining on the shoulder of my badass denim vest.\nSaxon carries on the flag of true heavy metal, and although not quite as good as the album that came before it, Saxon is still a leading force in the world of heavy metal.\n",
        "\n1997\u2019s Unleash the Beast was the turning point for Saxon\u2019s evolution. From the AC/DC-ish compositions they evolved to some kind of high quality power metal that fits very well with Byford\u2019s way of singing and the 80\u2019s legacy. Metalhead and Killing Ground continued in this new path, but now here comes the best album of the new Saxon era. Lionheart is the album that defines at its best the kind of metal that Saxon is doing actually: we can define it as a sum of traditional NWOBHM and european power metal. Lionheart is the best Saxon of the early 80s and the Best Saxon of the late 90s. Lionheart is Saxon for the 21st century.\n\nI will talk about the most defining songs of the album. Witchfinder General is the best example of the new Saxon sound: fast double-bass drums, elaborated guitar riffs and catchy chorus from the never aged voice of Biff Byford. The bridge creates more modern atmospheres (something that will be repeated in Beyond the Grave and Searching for Atlantis), something I don\u2019t like at all but fits in the new Saxon sound. Man and Machine keeps on with the Wicthfinder General conception, but with slower drums and even better chorus. I must say the production of the album is absolutely perfect. Producer Charlie Bauerfeind has made a great job mixing both analogical and digital recording systems.\n\nNow here comes the masterpiece of the whole album Lionheart. The Return is an instrumental/orchestral intro that leads us to the best song of the album. Lionheart resumes the Saxon sound for the 21st century: it reminds us to 1984\u2019s Crusader but also (in its faster parts) to the power metal that Saxon began to play in 1997. Paul Quinn and Doug Scarrat are certaintly better guitar players than they were some years ago. Biff said in an interview that Graham Oliver wasn\u2019t able to play that kind of new Saxon stuff because he didn\u2019t improve as a guitar player. We can\u2019t say the same about the current axemen. They make fantastic solos during the whole album. Lionheart is epic and great. It becomes a metal hymn because of the awesome chorus. Absolutely great.\n\nAfter some less inspirated and more modern attempts (Beyond the Grave and Justice) To live by the sword is again a good example of the new Saxon era. Elaborated and rapid riffs and traditional chorus that reminds us to the times of Power and the Glory. Jack Tars is an acoustic cover of a traditional english song and it\u2019s an extraordinary intro for English man\u2019o\u2019war, another epic and fast song in the line of Witchfinder General. Searching for Atlantis is a more modern and even adult composition, but the chorus are again catchy and comercial, while Flying on the edge is a less inspired song with funny lyrics.\n\nLionheart is an extraordinary album, It will become a classic. I\u2019m sure.\n",
        "\nHoly shit. Yes, holy shit. I cannot get over how great this album is. These ol' Brits have released, IMO, their best record in their 25 year career* (footnote - at this time, I still have not heard Unleash The Beast). Saxon deliver a no filler (yes, NO FILLER) metal classic. Eleven great tracks compose this masterpiece and each one is worthy of your time and money.\n\nI will not go into a song by song breakdown but I will note the truly exceptional. The album starts off with \"Witchfinder General\" which shows that Saxon can roll with the times and not sound outdated but still manage to sound like Saxon. Great way to open the album.\n\nNext up is the song that Priest hopes to write on their reunion album - \"Man and Machine\". Folks, this is what metal is all about. Riffs crushing, solos blaring, and very high headbangin' factor.\n\nThis is followed by an intro into the title track. The title track may be the best song Saxon has ever done and that, my friends, is really say somethin'.\n\nOther stellar tracks include English Manowar and Justice where Biff just shines. This may be his best vocal performance.\n\nTop notch performances, songwriting, and great cover art lead to what may be not only the best Saxon cd of all time but the best metal album of 2004. These ol' geezers still have it in them. Who knew?\n\nHIGHLY recommended.\n",
        "\nSometimes ignored, maybe because it is the first Saxon album that wasn't made by the classic line up, Power and the Glory stands as a very strong traditional metal album. Creating fast metal songs without turning to thrash -I won't say \"speed\", I don't like that term- and keeping at the same time the mid-tempo NWOBHM trademark, Saxon presents here a very interesting effort that, in many ways, was condemmned to be the post Eagle Has Landed album, so it was destined to lose -it's like Mot\u00f6rhead's Iron Fist-.\n\nThe cover art is a disaster, is just plain ugly, nothing to say here.\n\nThe title track opens the album with a killer riff and a quite interesting drum entrance. The song is awesome from the beginning to the end, pure mid-tempo crunchy heavy metal. The bass lines at the chorus are quite interesting, specially as they are not what you would expect from Dawson. There's this small break at the middle that sounds a little out of place. Guitar work is very cool, so are the solos. Vocals have a quite annoying reverb, but they are well done. Lyrics are about soldiers of fortune -according to Byfford, inspired by the Falklands war-; they are well done.\n\nRedline is the biker song that can't be out of a Saxon album. It's a mid tempo -a little slower than the title track- track, with some good guitar and drum work, but the basslines dissapointed me a little bit, since Dawson usually does this kind of songs with a pounding song behind the drums... well, this time he decided to follow the guitar lines a little bit more, so the potential of this song being a headbanging crunchy piece got kind of frustrated.\n\nWith a fast riff the pounding Warrior starts. This is a personal favorite, so I'll try to be objective. Drums make here a perfect match with the guitars, something that is kind of hard to oobtain by many metal acts. This has to be the most powerful vocal line Biff has ever made, his voice is totally poisoned and filled with power. It's faster than both previous tracks, but it's still kind of jumpy. The riff after the solo is incredible, specially cause the rest of the instruments follow it nicely. Nigel Glocker provides some excellent work on the drums here, being this the first Saxon album where the drums may be kind of protagonic -Gill's abbilities are undeniable, but they weren't show fully while he was on Saxon-.\n\nNightmare comes next, and it sucks. It is supposed to be a somehow slow balladesque song; it has this backing vocals that are half dark half pop that could bore anyone. The basslines are very interesting, despite of the song's qualities.\n\nRegarding This Town Rocks, Byfford says: \"...specifically written for the live show\". Now, I won't deny this must be great live, but it certainly sounds out of place here. As it was suggested in a review below mine -I think it was Boris'-, this should have never been recorded. Is the fastest song on the record, the lyrics are totally out of place -that song is to talk to the audience, not to sing it-.\n\nWatching The Sky is a cool track, although it is considered by many the first step to the posterior well known selling out. Although the main riff is indeed a little bit radio oriented, the song is a good mid-tempo metal piece and the lead break is very heavy, too heavy to achieve commercial success. Lyrics are about UFOs, and they are even dumber than the subject itself, so go figure.\n\nMidas Touch comes next. It's also kind of \"happier\" than regular Saxon, but the musicianship is very interesting, specially the rythm section. The arpeggio breaks for the verse are, as well, a nice experiment, not strange to Saxon -see 747-, but quite different this time, since they slow the song to re start it at the chorus without any kind of transition. It's maybe too long.\n\nFor closure, there is the weird The Eagle Has Landed. The beginning of the song is boring and reminds any kind of 80's action TV show sountrack, and it is very long. Then it turns to metal, but it's still boring, slow and repetitive. The reverb I mentioned on Power and the Glory is worse here, and the chorus is just annoying. I still don't see the deal of this song and I'll never see it.\n\nIn general terms, this album moves, as Crusader in an ethereal period of Saxon's career: the golden years seem to be over after the The Eagle Has Landed Live album, and the commercial days that would start with Innocence Is No Excuse are still not clear; sadly, due this, both albums get usually overlooked, but there's a lot of quality metal here that certainly can't be forgotten.\n",
        "\nOf course Saxon's 90's material is not as enjoyable as the 80's stuff. That usually happens with decent solid metal bands. Reading Maldito's review, I have to strongly disagree.\nCountry/blues/rock mixed? I don't think that could exist, plus this album is hardly that. I think the word that best fits this album, and the word that Maldito was trying to go for was \"hard rock.\" \n\nThis album can be really tricky, the opening song Dogs of War is an awesome song, with a bunch of catchy riffs. Vocal wise, this song is pure Saxon, something you might not see on the rest of the album. The next three songs are definitely blues influenced, like an Aerosmith/Poison like blues, but there is a more emphasis with the heaviness of the riffs. \n\nThen the album goes through another somersault with the song Hold On. This song is pure ballad like. Pretty cheesy, but not bad if you like the 80's heavy ballads. Then we go back to pure Saxon metal...of course some parts could be considered hard rock. The rest of the album is decent; no memorable songs, but some memorable parts. What makes this, at least in my eyes, heavy or hard, is the power of the riffs. Like on the songs The Great White Buffalo and Walking Through Tokyo, you might headbang or throw your fist in the air because the riffs have crunch. Provided with a nice drum beat, and you definitely have some decent songs. \n\nOne of the reasons why this album is not as good is because it is cheesy. Most of the songs lyrics are hardly enjoyable and actually funny at sometimes. But don't let silly things like that fool you. There are a lot of Saxon type riffs, and a couple of good songs. Vocally the album isn't up to par, but it's not ear bleeding bad. If you don't mind typical hard rock, then you will like this more then the average person. Overall it is not a bad Saxon album, just not the greatest.\n",
        "\nNote: This is my first review on this site. Not that anyone cares, but it is.\n\nAfter the release of their self titled album, Saxon recorded an album that certainly established many NWOBHM standards and contained many classics that still remain as mandatory live pieces. After an overview of the album and a couple of listens, you will conclude that this is the purest traditional heavy metal album ever: mid-tempo songs with crunchy riffs, faster pieces with repetitive high standards, a high pitched vocalist, lead guitar duels in all songs, a pounding and slow bass and a big variety in the lyrics.\n\nLet's go from the beginning, cover art. As the album, simple and classic: for the first time the almighty Steel Eagle shows it's shiny face to light grabbing a wheel with a very sober background. Not pretentious at all, just raw but yet very formal, like the music of the album.\n\nThe album starts with Motorcycle Men, slightly faster than classic mid tempo songs, with a standard riff going and going, some decent solos and outstanding drumming -for the time-. Biff's voice is at one of it's highest stages, including several high pitches and vibratos. Bass is almost unhearable and, as expected from the title, very cheesy lyrics. \n\nStand Up And Be Counted goes next, nice tune, a little slower, yet, nothing special, besides the chorus guitar harmonies that would have been better with some studio work; bass guitar here plays an essential role with pounding long notes in the background and drumming, again, for NWOBHM standards ranks very high. \n\nThen comes 747 (Strangers In The Night) one of the best metal songs ever recorded. Cool lyrics (quite unexpected at this point after the cheese of previous songs), nice intro solos and, better than all, the fucking chorus: while the drums and bass go on with a mid tempo pseudo aggressive line, some electric and melancholic arpeggios break into scene while Biff's voice recreates all the solitude of the song's character\u2026 just fucking classic. \n\nThe album's title track is another highlight, Wheels Of Steel. This song is certainly the heaviest of the album, a crunchy riff -somehow very Diamond Headesque- that goes on and on all over the song with some good solos and a regular vocal line, with the pounding bass that by now you know I love. Again, the drums make the song here -Pete Gill was certainly an awesome drummer-, without being too brilliant, but it's the only instrument that actually provides changes to the song; lyrics are as cheesy as it gets. \n\nFreeway Mad is the lowest spot on the album nothing, it's like taking an Elvis LP and speeding the LP player to make it sound fast and high pitched -I did that, and believe me, it sounds similar-. \n\nSee The Light Shining, dedicated to ex-Mot\u00f6rhead's Fast Eddie, is a cool track but it could have been named Stand Up And Be Counted revisited; the chorus harmonies are outstanding and the slow part of the end is a tempo change very unsusual for Saxon; best solos on the album. \n\nAnother cool track is Street Fighting Gang, with a nice guitar duel at the intro and some cool solos -besides Biff's siblings and Dawson's \"solo\"-,cool for headbanging and getting in a metal mood; cheesiest than cheese. \n\nSuzie Hold On is just the bad song of the album, forget about it. \n\nThe album ends with Machine Gun, faster song on the album, the standard fast NWOBHM track, it does not sound very good on the record but in live versions -The Eagle Has Landed pt. 1, with Fire In The Sky- it's way better; maybe it is too long for being that way; vocals sound a little out of place on some parts.\n\nProduction is essentially poor, particularly guitar distortion and bass sound -almost unhearable-, but, nevertheless, the album rocks and is certainly a NWOBHM classic with a big influence in many future bands and in Saxon itself.\n\n(Originally written for Raging-Metal.com - http://www.raging-metal.com/reviews/r0526.html)\n",
        "\nYes, Saxon has IT. It's hard to describe precisely what \"IT\" is, but it's the thing that only very few bands have, in their ability to combine competent metal fucking riffage with a dead-on sense of melody. WASP, Fates Warning, Diamond Head, Metal Church, are a few come to mind. And of course Saxon. Saxon have always been straddling the fine line between epic metal and plain old classic balls-out rockers... for every triumphant headbanging crowd pleaser like Denim and Leather, Rock the Nations or Solid Ball of Rock, they have an absurdly cool atmospheric classic like Crusader, The Eagle Has Landed, or 747. \n\nAnd this album is no exception... from the Sign of the Cross intro of Prelude to War (chased the lust of the earth below...), which then explodes into the monster title track, to the closer, Rock is Our Life, we've got yet another classic Saxon album on our hands. They distance themselves further and further from the disaster that was their middle era (Destiny, anyone?), proving that the Elton John experience was just a temporary lapse. Only very few bands can pull off a comeback, and I think the only band, other than Saxon, that has done it with such conviction and power is perhaps Agent Steel. Production notwithstanding, an album like Killing Ground doesn't just stand triumphantly beside an album like Strong Arm of the Law, it sounds just about the same too. Realising that trends are stupid and changing one's sound is only acceptable if you want late 80s commercial acceptance, Saxon continue on their merry path of not being a fucking mallcore band. This stuff is not just AS classic as, say, Denim and Leather, it is arguably EVEN MORE SO.\n\nCase in point... see the bonus disc. Princess of the Night '01, for example - could you tell that that song was written in 1980? Or, play Dragons Lair from CD1 - does it in any way scream 2001? No, it does not - both are timeless classics of Heavy Fucking Metal the way it is meant to be played. All guts, and all (Deeds of) glory. Classic riffage to make one bang one's head... from the epic stuffs of Killing Ground with its singalong chorus, done with Byfford's unique vocal style (Crusader, Crusader, please take me with you...) to the Cinderella-with-balls-the-size-of-refrigerators treatment of Coming Home, this is all METAL all the time. \n\nI think the only thing this album is missing is the obligatory blazing speed metal number... there is no Unleash the Painkiller to be found here - Dragon's Lair comes close, but is still firmly in the range of classic/power metal. Singalong chorus, melodic licks that aren't cheesy, and of course RIFFAGE.\n\nHighlights... the title track, and Deeds of Glory, two instant classics. Pretty much everything works here. Running for the Border continues their obsession with North American landmarks, and reminds me of a slower, more crushing version of Riot's old metal classic Outlaw, with the chorus of The Eagle has Landed spliced in. Speaking of Riot, there's another band that nobody fucking appreciates. Just like Saxon. Forget Iced Earth. Forget the idiocy of Schaffer - here's a band that's real fucking metal. Classic NWOBHM-tinged stuff... not even Iron Maiden is this good, and this authentic, nowadays. This doesn't sound forced or pretentious at all - this is retro without purposely sounding retro. It just IS. Sure, it's not 1985 now, but who knows what tomorrow might bring.\n\nThere's nothing here that'll jolt you into thinking \"whoa, what the fuck was that??\" In fact, the album on the whole has the subtly familiar \"so wait, where did I hear that riff before\" feeling at times - nothing revolutionary, but hey, the formula rocked hard in 1980, and it rocks hard today. Indispensable. Get the 2CD version if possible.\n",

But there is nothing that can challenge Saxon\u2019s \u201cDenim And Leather\u201d in sheer drinking, fucking and headbanging joy.\nSo yes, lyrically this is superior to every other album I\u2019ve heard, and it will make anyone who is Metal at heart go absolutely wild.\n\u201cI was lying on the beach, taking the rays\nListening to Deep Purple, reminiscing of old days\nI was hassled by a lifeguard, so I kicked him to the ground\nThere\u2019s always someone somewhere who\u2019ll try to turn you down\u201d\nListen and learn, kids. Biff Byford is the fucking man.\n\nAlso musically, this is one of the highs of NWOBHM, no doubt about it. Very catchy and memorable riffs and absolutely mindblowing solos - early Saxon had some of metal's greatest solos. Every song has a fucking awesome solo to back it up - are at the forefront along with Byford\u2019s awesome voice \u2013 he may not have a great range, but he\u2019s got the balls, my friends. Also, the drumming is truly intense here. The style is pretty standard for this type of music, but it\u2019s played way better than most drummers can hope to. Perfectly placed insanely cool fills (especially on \u201cPlay It Loud\u201d) and very solid rhythm works provides the important backbone for this album, along with the well played and perfectly mixed bass.\n\nTogether on this album, the guys blast out some truly immortal anthems of Heavy Fucking Metal. Motorcycle-song Princess of the Night opens the album in a speed metal manner, and from there it\u2019s just a ride of crazy heavy metal all through.\n\u201cNever Surrender\u201d, \u201cRough And Ready\u201d and \u201cPlay It Loud\u201d are probably my favourites on here along with the title track. Classic fuck-the-world-and-play-heavy-metal anthems done better than most can ever hope to be, and with some of the catchiest riffs ever, especially \u201cPlay It Loud\u201d. And as previously mentioned, the lyrics OWN!\n\u201cStanding on a corner, asking for a smoke\nI\u2019ll kick you in the deep, boy, steal away your girl\nTalked into a night-fight, they cut me to the bone\nDon\u2019t you mess with me, boy, you better leave me alone!\u201d\n\nAnd of course the previously mentioned title track\u2026 DENIM! AND LEATHER! BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER! IT WAS YOU THAT SET THE SPIRIT FREE! I have orgasmic sensations when that plays in my speakers. A midpaced heavy metal anthem like no other, and should be considered a true metal classic, just like the entire album.\n\nBut really, there\u2019s nothing on the album that does not completely own. Sure, when they try to write love lyrics on the song \u201cOut of Control\u201d it comes off as very forced, cause Saxon aren\u2019t supposed to write love songs- but musically, it\u2019s killer. More melodic than the rest, and very nicely done. And this album has plenty of brilliant lyrics to make up for one song that falls short in that one department.\n\u201cFire In The Sky\u201d also has some kinda out of place lyrics, suddenly dealing with nuclear war, but it works quite well, and again the music rocks. Pay special attention to that cool lead section that appears in the middle of the song. Not typical Saxon style, but very catchy, great stuff. I could go on dissecting this album a bit more, but I\u2019m gonna let you guys find out for yourself, if you don\u2019t have this already (in which case you haven\u2019t experienced Metal).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of people saying our music is too loud\nThey never stop complaining, try to turn us down\nBut if you want it louder, we\u2019ll turn it up full blast\nThey\u2019ll never stop the music, they\u2019re living in the past!\u201d\n",
        "\nAfter their fantastic offering the previous year, Innocence Is No Excuse, the band takes a sudden dip in the mud. I\u2019ve no idea what the FUCK they were thinking when producing the majority of the tracks on here. Shit, were they trying to go pop or something?? Sometimes it sounds as if they were attempting to be a blues band as well here, as horrid as that may sound. Oh yeah, there is also one track that gives me the impression that they might have wanted to go in a big band/swing direction too, mixing it all with guitars. Sounds awful, eh? Well it is. Don\u2019t worry though, there are still enough METAL tracks on here that live up to the standards of Saxon\u2026err\u2026two only, but still enough to have given hope to those back then, that Saxon was not completely dead. Saxon\u2019s always been a band of wide variety, but they fail to deliver the variety well here on this album.\n\nRock The Nations - A tough and heavy attitude with a damn good chorus, so you know fuck well that this is indeed Saxon. Obviously, this is one of the better tunes on here, and one of the two tunes that live up to the Saxon standard. This is one of those \u201craise your fist in the air and pump like mad!\u201d type of tunes. Oh yeah, the lead solo is fucking terrific.\n\nBattle Cry - Despite how shitty the majority of this album is, what we have here is one of Saxon\u2019s all time best songs. The bass lines and drumming are done amazingly well, giving off the impression of one fighting for his life in a battle field. The chorus is one that grabs you by the balls, \u201cLet me hear! Let me hear! Let me hear your battle cry!\u201d. Everything about this song fucking kills.\n\nWaiting For The Night - Aside from the catchy beat and riffage, this song is just too damn poppy. Like a few other tracks on here, I can tell this song had good potential, but for some reason, the band chose not to do that and screwed it all up instead. Decent tune, but this IS NOT the way Saxon should sound. Any lighter, and it could be played on a soft rock station.\n\nWe Came Here To Rock - Now just look at that song title, you know this has to definatly rock! Attitude and catchiness fill the lyrics, supported with damn good riffs, but\u2026it could have been a bit better if the band hadn\u2019t been on a \u201cWe wanna go pop!\u201d trip.\n\nYou Ain\u2019t To Angel - Groovy all the way through, but way too dull in riffage. If it wasn\u2019t for Biff\u2019s killer vocal deliverance, I would have just written this tune off right away. The song is indeed catchy, but quite boring at times.\n\nRunning Hot - Last good song you\u2019ll hear on the album. No pop and no experimental orientation, this song just plain out smokes! The vocals kill, and the driving rhythm is excellent. Oh, and not to mention the solo, which just fucking slays. \n\nParty \u2018Til You Puke - Here\u2019s where the band attempts to go big band/swing, filled with jazzy drum beats and big band piano playing in the background. Believe it or not, I believe that this song could have been turned into some killer tune, keeping the same lyrics and song structure, though changing the AWFUL music here. Only highlight here is the ending solo, but that type of solo can be heard in many other Saxon tunes as well.\n\nEmpty Promises - ::yawn::\u2026boring! Slow and slightly groovy, but amazingly tiring and lame, both riff and vocal wise. Nothing good at all to be heard here.\n\nNorthern Lady - Okay, here is where Elton John does the piano work. Needless to say, this is Saxon\u2019s worse ballad ever. WHY must they do this shit to their fans. As if Party \u2018Til You Puke and Empty Promises didn\u2019t make the listeners frown enough, they just have to go further with this lame-ass ballad, probably causing the listener to hit the eject button or stop the turn table, just like it did with me.\n",
        "\nProbably the most underrated of all Saxon albums. I remember hearing \"Broken Heros\" before buying this album and loving it. Of all the tracks that are on here, that is the only tune still played live today off of this release. So after reading the mass amounts of negative reviews on this album, I figured that \"Broken Heros\" must have to be a stand out track on the album, because what I heard did not even come close to sucking. Still, I purchased the album anyway and from the opening of the first track, to the rockin' fun ending...I was purely amazed! \"Rockin' Again\" is one of the best songs that this band has ever done and deserves to be played live today, as well as \"Raise Some Hell\"....in which I am sure would drive the metal crowed absolutly WILD! Not one filler track on here, just pure, fun hard rock/metal tunes to enjoy and head bang to. \nSo why is this so underrated? I probably will never know. Perhapse it was the sudden change of style. Kind of has that same 80s hard rock tone that 'Crusader' had, except with much more attitude and power. Just check out the incredible drumming and galloping riffs on \"Raise Some Hell\". This is definetly one album to raise some hell to! \n\nBest songs: Rockin' Again, Devil Rides Out, Broken Heros, Raise Some Hell\n",
        "\n1983 was a tremendously great year for Metal, and this album is one of the main reasons why. Power And The Glory is not only my personal favorite Saxon album, but also the album that proved to the world that Saxon was no minor NWOBHM band. Of course, the previous albums proved that as well, but by 1983, the NWOBHM movement had died down, leaving only a few bands standing, and Saxon was one of them. The music was heavier, more aggressive and louder than anything they had previously done, as well as anything they\u2019d do in the near future.\n\nPower And The Glory - In my opinion, this is THE ULTIMATE Saxon song. Yes, even better than Wheels Of Steel, Crusader and Denim And Leather. THIS is what Saxon is all about. Kickass riffage, powerful vocal range, catchy choruses that get nailed to your skull, strong attitude and ear piercing solos! Saxon\u2019s lyrical war image begins here with this song.\n\nRedline - A very groovy track, one of those biker themed songs that Saxon had always been damn good at doing. It\u2019s not as good as Motorcycle Man or Stallions Of The High nor is it as fast, it\u2019s just groovy and mid-paced all the way through.\n\nWarrior - Why isn\u2019t this song ever mentioned among Saxon fans??? Hell, this is by far one of their best tunes of all time. Another powerful war themed song that gets you pumped up to wanna do something. The vocals are terrific here, and the mid solo is absolutely fantastic, which still leads me to wonder why this song isn\u2019t more popular. Only songs that ever get mention from this album are the title track, This Town Rocks and The Eagle Has Landed. All great tunes, but this one deserves to be up there with them.\n\nNightmare - The mood that this song sets is very mysterious and dark in its own way\u2026I mean hey, just look at the title. It\u2019s a ballad, but not an \u201cOh dear please come back to me!! BOOHOOO!!!\u201d type of ballad. This one really kicks a lot of ass. Biff\u2019s vocal work here is amazing.\n\nThis Town Rocks - A crazy-ass speed Metal tune, almost thrashy as times. My city is mentioned in this song, which is a major upside to me liking it, though not being the only reason I love it. I love this song because it\u2019s a full out speed Metal assault that does not calm down once for the four minutes that it\u2019s on, not until the very last incredible drum solo at the end. Oh yeah, I fuckin\u2019 love the line \u201cWe\u2019re gonna Saxonize, we\u2019re vandalize your soul\u201d\u2026kickass stuff right there.\n\nWatching The Sky - Influenced by the movie E.T\u2026strange, but it is a great song, about watching for signs of the extraterrestrial life of course. The highlight here is definatly the chorus, without a doubt, though there is some outstanding riffage here and there in the song.\n\nMidas Touch - Yup, you guessed it, the song\u2019s about Midas and his touch of gold. It\u2019s almost in the same vein as the previous tune, just much more vocal oriented and with better riffage, a bit heavier as well.\n\nThe Eagle Has Landed - One of the songs that Saxon is quite famous for, obviously. I mean, they have two popular live albums named after it. This is actually one of the heavier songs on the album, starts out very slow, yet solid and heavy at first, and towards the end, speeds up all the way into a fast-paced Metal tune, sort of like one of those slower thrash metal songs from some 80s thrash band. A masterpiece, that\u2019s all the more I can say about this song.\n",
        "\nAside from Angel Witch's debute, this album is definetly the best NWOBHM release by far. Ahead of its time, the album deliveres non-stop heavy metal that would influence many speed/thrash acts later on in the 80s and even today. At this time in 1980, the only other bands that could even live up to this style were Motorhead and Judas Priest, but they had already been around a while by this year and this was Saxon's 3rd studio release barely. It's so surprising to me that more speed metal bands have not covered Saxon material, especially from this album, which without a doubt is their fastest up until the late 80s. The influence that this album had on Manowar's \"death to false metal\" image is undeniable, considering that Saxon went on tour with Black Sabbath in 1980 in support of this album, when Joey was part of the road crew for Black Sabbath. Just give a listen to the speed metal classic, \"Heavy Metal Thunder\", and you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\nHeavy Metal Thunder - Who would have ever thought a song like this would have come out in 1980?? Total speed metal, and the first song to have ever used the term \"heavy metal\" in the song title. This is probably the best song on the album. Either this one, or....\n\nTo Hell And Back Again - ....this killer tune! Another speed metal number that was really ahead of its time. The riffage is fucking phenominal and if I had to choose 1 song from Saxon that was the most underrated, it would definatly be this one, without a doubt. The attitude and energy makes this one an instant classic.\n\nStrong Arm Of The Law - Man, this chorus is is catchy as all fuck! I mean, the song itself is pretty average and mid-paced up until the chorus comes along, then it'll be playing in your head over...and over and over and over......and over.....\n\nTaking Your Chances - God damn! The riffs here are fucking awesome, groovy as Hell but fast at the same time. Since there is really no amazing solo to be hear, nor catchy chorus, I'd have to say that the riffs are the only highlight, and by the way they sound, it's enough to rank this as one of Saxon's best songs. Actually, the solo towards the end kicks a lot of ass as well.\n\n20,000 Feet - Total speed metal, with killers riffs and awesome verses sung by one of the best. The song is about flying in a jet airplane, so there are really cool sound effects at the end, which leads us right into...\n\nHungry Years - ...this bluesy number. Not being a huge fan of blues, I'll just go ahead and pass this song off as average. The entire song is blues based, from the riff rythm to the solo, making the overall song decent at the most, and the weakest point on the album.\n\nSixth Form Girls - Now this is a really fun song with catchy riffs and an incredibly catchy chorus. Oh yeah, the lyrics are really nice as well, just read the title of the song and you'll know why... ;)\n\nDallas 1PM - One of the heaviest songs on the album, and also one of Saxon's all time best songs, along with the first 2 tracks on here. The song itself is about the assassination of JFK, complete with sound effects such as a gun fireing, an ambulance and radio broadcasting of the tradgedy. Saxon was suppose to perform this one live when I saw them on tour, but didn't due to the 9/11 attacks. >:(\n",
        "\nNot far behind Strong Arm Of The Law, this album defenitly delivers the goods. Fast riffing, tough as nails lyrics, powerful vocals delivered by one of the best in metal, and killer choruses...just check out the first and last songs and you'll know what I mean. This album is just full of attitude, full of it! Not one weak point on the album, just killer riffing and attitude from begining to end.\n\n1. Princess Of The Night - If the opening riff does not grab your attention at a sudden instant and force your ears against the speaker, then I don't know what will. The entire song itself is pure energy and power, with a catchy as hell chorus and a solo to die for.\n\n2. Never Surrender - One of the more \"in your face\" Saxon tunes. More or less, it's mainly the chorus that possess the tough attitude, but the overall song kicks ass as well.\n\n3. Out Of Control - The pace and riffage is basically in the same tone as the previous tune, though in a less intense way. Of all the songs on the album, this one is probably the least catchiest and/or memorable, but as I stated before, there's not one weak track on here and every song is well worth a listen.\n\n4. Rough And Ready - You know, I absolutly HATE when a band has several kick ass songs that make it big, and then some others that kick just as much ass but get little or no attention. This happens to be one of those songs. Being more or less as catchy and powerful as Princess Of The Night and the title track, I think this song simply deserves more attention than it gets. Well, it gets no attention, but hey it's still a kickass song.\n\n5. Play It Loud - Are these not some of the coolest ever lyrics or what?? If you wanna know what they are then listen to the damn song. But aside from the lyrical factor, the music is quite heavy and supports the lyrics with a mean, distorted tone.\n\n6. And The Bands Played On - Despite it's short length, this happens to be one of the best tracks on the album. The verses are probably some of the catchiest I have ever heard, much catchier than the chorus for sure. \n\n7. Midnight Rider - The main riff here is quite groovey, and the singing tone that Biif uses fits the groove quite well. Mid-paced and catchty, that's what this song mainly is. Yeah, a combination of those two characteristics = one awesome song.\n\n8. Fire In The Sky - Aside from Princess Of The Night, this is the only other speed metal tune on the album. The song is about an outburst of radiation that claims the lives of many, so the intensity and speed of the song fit quite well with that. The great thing about Saxon is that when they write songs, no matter what they're about, they make sure that the lyrics fit the music correctly. Not many bands do it this well.\n\n9. Demin And Leather - The heaviest song on the album, as well as the most powerful. This, in my opinion, is one of the greatest Metal anthems as well as major crowd mover when played live, even today. The song itself is about the outbreak of the NWOBHM scene back in '79, and the audience that Saxon drew which set them apart from the rest of the bands. After all, Saxon was the first NWOBHM to ever get signed. Yeah, all thanks to the fans. This song is basically a tribute to their fans everywhere.\n",
        "\n...but what the fuck happened with the rest?? Okay, so most of the other songs on here sound like a British version of Motley Crue, which of course isn't so bad, but when you compare to to the title track, you'd be expecting sooooo much more out of this album.\n\nThe Crusader Prelude - Hehe, you already know what type of song you're in for after hearing this...\n\nCrusader - This song is so fucking amazing! Though not very fast, the overall mood just makes you wanna take up a sword and slash up your foes, showing no mercy what-so-ever. The vocals are done amazingly well, and the heavy, mid-paced riffs just add so much more to the mood, fitting the lyrics quite well. No wonder why this is such an incredibly popular tune among the Metal crowd and why it's still played live today. Now you know why one would expect so much more out of an album after hearing a song like this...\n\nA Little Bit Of What You Fancy - Minus the title track, this is actually one of the better tunes here. Good, solid speed Metal to headbang like crazy too, but this song sounds like it belongs more on Strong Arm or Denim....well...maybe not. :p\n\nSailing To America - Once more, this is another one of the better songs on the album. The music and lyrics just make you wish that you were out on a ship at sea, sailing in the cool breeze while drinking a bottle of rum. I love this song, one of the only three songs on the album that I can actually say I love.\n\nSet Me Free - Now I keep forgetting who actually did the original of this song...it is a cover. Ah well, Heathen did a much better job on, ashamed to say. One thing Saxon has never been quite good at is doing covers, as shown in other albums. Just like the Heathen version, this is a great speed Metal number with outstanding riffs, but it doesn't even come close to the three previous tracks.\n\nJust Let Me Rock - A mid-placed, slightly bluesy number. Only thing I really like about this song are the attitud and lyrics, which do live up to the title. Lyrically, this song means a lot to people like me, but other than that, the track itself is a bit weak.\n\nBad Boys (Like To Rock N Roll) - Decent at best, but if I wanted to listen to hard edged glam, I'd crank up some Crue or Twisted Sister. Yeah, I do like some glam Metal, but when I'm in the mood for Saxon, I wanna hear Saxon goddamnit!!\n\nDo It All For You - Ahh, a ballad. Of all the ballads that Saxon has currently done up till this year, 1984, this is probably the weakest one of all. Good track, but it's no Suzie Hold On and it sure as Hell is no Nightmare! Good riffage though. :D\n\nRock City - God damnit! As if Bad Boys was not glammy enough!! Oh yeah, and I'm sure that song title is very original as well. Pfft! Like I said before, glam is decent, but Saxon is suppose to be far more than just average or decent. Needless to say, this song and Bad Boys blow away every other glam band I have heard, but they do not belong on this album, nor on ANY Saxon album.\n\nRun For Your Lives - Well, at least the album's ending is great. This is the only other song that I can actually say I love. I'm not even going to compare it to the title track because it doesn't even come close, but, this is still a terrific song, second best on the album. The chorus is what makes this song so addictive, it's one of those 'nail it to the back of your skull choruses'. Oh yeah, the verses are pretty catchy too and the lyrics are something to definetly mention...\"I had a dream last night and I saw you burn!\". So yeah, this oughta make the listener smile after hearing the last previous songs.\n",
        "\nWell the first Saxon release is more raw than their later releases. Of course, the quality of musicianship that would appear on their later albums is what mainly lacks on this disc, but you still have some killer tunes on here. It would be a large step forward for the band on their next release, but if you like traditional hard rock/metal, then check this one out. After all, this album marked the start of the NWOBHM, highly influenced by bands like Judas Priest and UFO.\n\nRainbow Theme - A really strong bass line opens up this track, followed by an really nice hard rockin' groove beat. About a minute later, the pace slows down into a very melodic and enchanting number, with Biff Byford showing off just how fuckin' good of a vocalist he is.\n\nFrozen Rainbow - I have no idea why they turned this song into 2 tracks, but it's all really the same song. This track starts up during the solo, which is amazing, by the way, and speeds up from there.\n\nBig Teaser - A less impressive tune, but overall decent, just straight forward hard rock. The chorus is the only highlight here.\n\nJudgment Day - The drum intro that kicks off this tune just smokes, as well the catchy riffing that follows. This is a song that softens and then speeds up at various times through out, ending with one incrdible solo.\n\nStallions Of The Highway - By far one of the best tracks on the album, this song totally rules all the way through. One of the infamous biker tunes that Saxon is so damn good at doing, so I am hopeing to hear it at this year's Biker Fest in my city when Saxon takes the stage. >:)\n\nBacks To The Wall - Not one of my favorites, but it's the only song that Saxon still plays live from this album today. A great hard rock song none the less, but that's about it. \n\nStill Fit To Boogie - The title of this song sounds like something Motorhead would come up with...as well as the sound. Okay, maybe not the vocals, but the musical influences of Motorhead are quite clear here.\n\nMilitia Guard - Ah yes, Saxon is not only known for writing killer biker tunes, but also war tunes as well, and this is one of the best war songs that they have come up with. The marching drum beat and neo-classical intros are the highlights here, but the rest of the song itself is just incredible and underrated.\n",
        "\nThis album is way the fucking Hell better than the last album. Suckstiny, I mean that was just pure crap. This is only halfway to pure crap, and in fact the first few songs are completely excellent!!\n\nThe title track starts things off, and man this is a fun catchy song. \"The preacher found redemption in a Jacksonville motel...\" - then Altar of the Gods is classic Saxon, at 100% strength. Requiem is a bit slower, but still very good, as is Lights in the Sky.\n\n\"I Just Can't Get Enough\" is a bit cheesier, but still solid. A little 80s-rock influence, coming from their last N albums, but then again this isn't all that far removed from Wheels of Steel or something in the general 80s-metal vibe. Nice chorus, too.\n\n\"Baptism of Fire\" is the obligatory speed metal offering, and is probably the highlight of the album - either this or the title track. This one reminds me of \"Sixth Form Girls\" from their very strong (arm of the law) second album. \n\nHere is where the album takes a fucking nosedive... \"Ain't Gonna Take It\" is crap that combines the worst of two or three Saxon songs that I can't remember... sounds like a leftover from the Destinshit album. \"I'm on Fire\" is a bit better but they blatantly rip off a solo from a Boston song. I forget which, but it's readily obvious, and it's one of the classic rock staple songs... can't miss it. \"Refugee\" is more crap, unfortunately. \"Bavarian Beaver\" is a bit of a noodle bit, and then \"Crash Dive\" - not bad, and a good closer track. Nice riff after the chorus.\n\nSo this album totally takes a sinker about halfway through, but the first six songs are all excellent, and for that the album is possibly worth having. If you like some of the more rockish Saxon albums (not the really bad ones like Destiny or Elton John the Nations, but I mean Power and the Glory), you'll like this one.\n",
        "\nSome of the songs on here are nice classic Saxon, and the rest is getting to be really silly, forgettable 80s metal, and I don't mean that in a good way. Rockish and midpaced - the bad traits that they had managed to push out of the way on \"Strong Arm\" came back a bit on \"Denim and Leather\", and then really wormed their way into the album sound here.\n\nThe good: \"Power and the Glory\" is catchy and just a little epic too - midpaced and anthemic, and definitely fun. \"Redline\" is decent - faster, with decent riffs, but it just feels empty. It has that sloppily-put-together aura about it, as though they just wanted a quick hit, as opposed to really thinking it out. \"Warrior\" and \"Nightmare\" kinda go about their business without really contributing much to anything, and then \"This Town Rocks\" definitely shows the difference between Studio Saxon and Live Saxon. All of their songs are written to be performed live, I have no idea why they (or any other self-respecting metal band for that matter) keep putting out studio albums... here, the crowd interaction isn't just implied, it's there clear as day... \"Does this town know how to rock??\" Not a bad song, just something that doesn't make any sense to be put on a non-live album.\n\n\"Watching the Sky\" - kind of a silly song again. \"Midas Touch\" is one that really brings back the classic Saxon sound. Catchy and definitely very much heavy metal. Then, \"The Eagle Has Landed\" is a very interesting song. It is VERY slow and atmospheric, and just keeps building up to heaviness, and finally finishes at around midpace - this is definitely a live staple, and really the crowd is missing.\n\nSo what we have here is a very inconsistent album. Some of the songs are really screaming \"Def Leppard\" at times - both bands kinda went down the same sellout path in the 1980s, except one managed to keep their drummer intact and thus completely sold out in 1984 or so, as opposed to 1987! Really an expendable album, and quite sad after the last few.\n",
        "\nSaxon further their solid metal attitude here - quality songwriting with nice, prominent, memorable riffs are the norm here. Nothing is quite as insanely speed-metal as on the previous album, but nonetheless this one is quite enjoyable.\n\n\"Princess of the Night\" is the fastest song on here - this is certainly speed metal, though not quite as heavy as say, Machine Gun. It has a really great solo in the middle, though, bringing to mind Highway Star at times. \"Never Surrender\" is a bit slower and more anthemic, with a nice chorus. It's merely okay on the studio release - definitely hear it live for greatest effect. \"Out of Control\" has silly lyrics - something that on a previous album would not have worked, but here the riffs make the song quite consistent. \n\n\"Rough and Ready\" is also pretty damn heavy, and \"Play It Loud\" is good solid defiant heavy metal attitude, with great riffs to boot. \"And the Bands Played On\" is a tribute to Donington, Monsters of Rock (a performance that must be heard to be believed, Saxon completely tore it up that day!!). The song brings to mind \"Rock Hard Ride Free\" by Priest in the way the intro melody works and goes into the song.\n\n\"Midnight Rider\" is not quite fast, but the riffs keep the song moving steadily enough. \"Fire in the Sky\" is apparently about nuclear death or whatnot - still, the music fits in with the rest of the album. Decent classic heavy metal - doesn't quite turn the riffs to 11, but doesn't descend into self-mockery either.\n\nThe title track... it's pretty nice, though the chorus is just a bit silly, and has to be heard live to be truly appreciated. Most of Saxon is that way - this album included. It's pretty decent, as the songwriting is there, but the intensity is not nearly as strong as on the live albums.\n",
        "\nThis has to be the greatest Saxon studio album. Sure they throw on a few rock moments, as opposed to all out metal moments, but even those manage to be quite great, sounding like a precursor to Accept, as opposed to something that survived the 70s and refused to die.\n\nThe first track... \"Heavy Metal Thunder\". Fuck yeah, this is heavy indeed. Great speed-metal riff that threatens to snap your spine quite a few times, combined with awesome soloing as well. My goodness this song just fucking owns. \"To Hell and Back Again\" is even faster, surprisingly!!! The riffs aren't quite as well formed, but here, Saxon has really got some good idea going. \"Strong Arm of the Law\" is a bit slower, but sounds like something Accept could've put out in1983-84, or so. Very much ahead of this time, this album is.\n\n\"Taking Your Chances\" is more power-metal than anything else. The chorus is a bit boring, but the riffs underneath are good. That's what the previous two Saxon studio albums were kinda missing at times - well-defined riffage. It's certainly here.\n\n\"20,000 Ft.\" is more speed metal with a nice melodic main riff. \"Hungry Years\" is a bit slower, but as opposed to kinda rocking, it totally BLUDGEONS you. If it's not speed metal, it's power metal. \"Sixth Form Girls\" has silly lyrics, but the song is totally catchy. Then, \"Dallas 1pm\" is just fucking ominous - the way the riffs are set up, they completely hep the theme of the song develop.\n\nSo what we have here, folks, is a Saxon album that manages to hold one's attention from beginning to end, consistently. Something that only their live albums tend to do, their studio album managed to pull off. Very nice.\n",
        "\nThis is pretty much a staple of the NWOBHM - at times, it's a bit rockish and silly, but some of the tracks here are pure fucking metal that deserve to be paid immediate attention to.\n\n\"Motorcycle Man\" starts off the album in great speed-metal fashion. Nice headbanging anthem to be had here. \"Stand Up and Be Counted\" is a bit slower, and kinda rock-and-roll-ish, which Saxon also was known for at the time.\n\n\"747\" is just a downright cool power metal song. It's not quite as heavy as some of the other tracks here but the riffs are complete metal. Nice lead guitar to be found in here too. The title track, it's just a bit boring. Okay, it's very boring. But hey, we've got \"Freeway Mad Next\", which comes roaring back to kick our faces in. Yes, when they sing about owning the highway, they suddenly get very very good.\n\n\"See the Light Shining\" is also pretty silly, and \"Street Fighting Gang\" is a step up with some cool riffs. \"Suzie Hold On\" is pretty damn crappy. It's a stupid ballad. Again, sometimes they just wanna play nice happy rock 'n roll...\n\nat other times, they fucking own us all with their monstrous speed metal riffs, like the last song!! Machine Gun!!!!! This thing nearly would give fucking Blitzkrieg a fright - for February, 1980 - read, before Rapid Fire, this is really fucking insane. We have to sit through the rest of the album for quite a while, but when we get here... PREPARE... TO... DIE!!!!!\n\nFuck yeah!! The album begins great, ends great... in the middle, kinda goes through the motions a bit. Get it, though - just for the last track!!!\n\nMACHINE GUN!!! MACHINE GUN!!!\n",
        "\nThis one is pretty much solid heavy metal from beginning to end. There's only one ballad, and none of the silly rockish moments that they seemed to enjoy during the 80s.\n\nWe start with Gothic Dreams - everyone's doing intros nowadays, why not Saxon? This leads into the title track - holy shit!!!!! Pure fucking speed metal - by far the best song Saxon has ever done. Apparently, they all sat down and listened to Painkiller and came up with this afterward. This song fucking rules, that's all I gotta say. Nice fucking leads, nice fucking riffs, and they throw in a few midpaced moments just for variety, and the whole thing fucking kicks ass. \n\nThen, \"Terminal Velocity\" sounds a bit like an update of \"20,000 Feet\" - not quite as fast, but with some nice riffs. \"Circle of Light\" and \"The Thin Red Line\" are nice fun power-metal singalongs, and then we get to \"Ministry of Fools\". More speed metal. Not quite as \"rip your fucking head off and shove it down your throat\" as the title track, but still, very nice and aggressive. \"When it comes right down to it, you're all the fucking same!!\"\n\nThen, \"The Preacher\" - about 7 years after it ceased to be relevant, they jump on the old Jimmy Swaggert thing. Yeah, every band's gotta do it at some point. Decent song, kinda unspectacular, though. Probably the weakest on here, aside from the ballad. \"Bloodletter\" is next - more speed metal, kids. Another classic.\n\n\"Cut out the Disease\" is a bit different - more thrashy, midpaced, and downright menacing. You'll headbang for four minutes, and then kill your family. \"Absent Friends\" is the ballad, it sucks, it's obligatory, skip it. Go to \"All Hell Breaking Loose\" - more fucking speed metal!!!\n\nYes, they almost completely nailed this one. Some great speed to be had here, and none of the bullshit of the late 80s, or even on some of their earlier albums. Highly recommended.\n"
