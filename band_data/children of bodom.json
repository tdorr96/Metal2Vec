    "Band Reviews": [
        "\nThere isn\u2019t much that I can say about this album that has not already been said, but I still want to review it since I think it\u2019s one of the best metal albums of all time.\n\nThe album is perfect in every way imaginable. It has amazing riffs (basically every song aside from \"Northern Comfort\"), great solos (\"Bodom After Midnight\", \"Everytime I Die\"), effective use of keyboards adding a lot to the album\u2019s atmosphere (\"Mask of Sanity\", \"Children of Decadence\"). The production is awesome, too, which is what I always appreciate in music. You can hear the drums, the keyboards and the vocals (brilliant as always) very clearly. At the same time, the album does not blatantly copy the \"Hatebreeder\" sound, but instead, improves certain areas of it. For example, the guitars sound a little bit rawer and more aggressive (the album is generally louder and more energetic than its predecessor), which suits it perfectly, since it focuses more on speed and emotion than on atmosphere and does not have many standing out songs like \"Downfall\" (besides \"Everytime I Die\"). The latter is probably the only thing worth of criticism about the record, but I think the remarkability of riffs and solos in this particular case outweighs a slight lack of musical diversity.\n\nLyric-wise, \"Follow the Reaper\" is also decent. The majority of the album\u2019s lyrics aren\u2019t straight forward hatred and anger and have a certain mysterious feeling to them (just like the lyrics of other CoB albums). My personal favorites in terms of lyrics would probably be \"Children of Decadence\", \"Everytime I Die\" and \"Kissing the Shadows\".\n\nMy favorite thing about this album is its consistency. The first 4 songs (almost half of the album) are straightaway bangers, while the rest are at least good (\"Taste of My Scythe\", \"Kissing the Shadows\") and at most \u2013 incredible (\"Mask of Sanity\", \"Hate Me!\"). The only songs that I feel are slightly weaker than the rest are \"Northern Comfort\" and \"Kissing the Shadows\", but they are still enjoyable and thus I won\u2019t be very critical of them.\n\nSo, from my humble experience I can say this is one of the best and most remarkable albums of all time. A melodic death masterpiece, an album that will never be forgotten and a wonderful way to get acquainted with the genre. Also, a perfect soundtrack for... nearly everything.\n",
        "\nWhat a powerful performance on all fronts! Long live Alexi Laiho! Just getting to reviewing this now, and wow, what a series of positive melodic death/power metal! The music on here is epic, I like it a little bit more than 'Hate Crew Deathroll', well...maybe. I think the compositions on here are sublime. They really did the listener good with this recording! The riffs, synthesizers, vocals, drums and production quality is more than adequate! The tear your speakers apart! Alexi was great on here rhythm and lead guitars. I think that this is the most thought out COB release ever. They tended to go downhill after this.\n\nThe music a divine music is what's on here. They did everything right on this album. Everything sounds original and to the point riff-writing wise. I think that it's pretty technical as well. Fast, ripping, and relentless. Such a great album. All was right when they wrote this release. I think the music is some of most original melodic death metal they've put forth! I dig the power metal element as well. They mix the instruments quite well and they are just relentless in terms of the energy! It's rapid fire music here, and Alexi's vocals are fantastic! Everything on here hit home with me nothing on here that I'd change.\n\nThe sound quality was top notch. Everyone on here sounded great and like I said I'd change nothing. It's a divine masterpiece. They knew exactly what to do with the songwriting. I don't know why they fell after this. Maybe the aggregate of fans then they got a little bit lazy perhaps. With the 'Hate Crew Deathroll' and 'Halo of Blood' I think were good solid albums but not to the equation of excellence that this held forth. They really did hit a pinnacle release here just wish they didn't regress all up until Alexi's death (RIP). It's rumored that he had a bad alcohol problem hence the nickname \"Wildchild.\"\n\nSo to sum it up, 'Follow the Reaper' is probably the best COB in their entire discography. They hit home on every track. The aggression, hatred and vibe is totally sick. They definitely worked hard on this and what an output! From every aspect, they conquered. They didn't do anything wrong on here, simply said: NO MISTAKES. It's amazing the talent that the band had all up until the end. It's a sad reality that there will be no more COB. All we have now is to appreciate the memories by playing this classic and 'Hate Crew Deathroll'. I'm biased with that one though. Own this!\n",
        "\nDuring a period of time when we can enjoy the new posthume Bodom After Midnight single, Paint the Sky With Blood, I think it\u2019s a great opportunity to take a step back and review the Children of Bodom farewell album, Hexed, released on March 2019. The purple album carries a certain emotional charge being the last full-lengh effort of Alexi Laiho before his death in 2020. A too young to die situation considering that Bodom After Midnight could have been a revival for Laiho\u2019s musical work. In the case of Hexed, I saw it back then as a slow decline in terms of energy, creativity and identity.\n\nIn fact, Hexed seems to be a commercial-friendly album trying to blend together all eras of the band career, witch is okay, but not consistent in quality. There are as good musical moments as uninspired weak solos and sloppy melodies. For example, This Road has a very good introduction, a nice verse, but the melody of the chorus is just a dissonant high pitched guitar that sounds more weird than anything else (In a bad way). Riffing is okay in general, but the complaint about the solos and the melodies in a Bodom album is a thing that should not be. Going through all the musical eras of the band is not a bad idea, but compared to previous albums, Hexed lacks of identity. It is hard to identify a sound and something that caracterizes the full-lengh. Plus, even if Glass Houses reminds us the neoclassical era and Knuckleduster the Are You Dead Yet album, those songs would be far from the best tracks on those albums they try to make us remember. In my opinion, part of those flaws are due to the overpolished sound of the album. Everything lacks of punch and dirtyness. When you listen to classics like Follow The Reaper or Hatecrew Deathroll (they\u2019re not the only ones just saying), what makes them great albums is the agressivity and the imperfection of the production : raw and raspy vocals, hammering drums, deep keyboards and imperfect still agressive musical guitar playing. In Hexed, the drums are basic, weak, and the guitar tone is too much polished. The keys are there, but in some tracks, you could remove them without affecting the song. To figure out what I mean, listen to the version of Knuckleduster from the Trashed, Lost & Strungout EP and compare it to the Hexed version. \n\nLet\u2019s get to the qualities now. Hexed is not an awful Bodom album by any means. Except the last few weaker tracks of the album, every songs have enjoyable moments. I like This Road as an introduction with its thrash metal vibe, the spookyness of Hecate\u2019s Nightmare where I really like Laiho\u2019s deep expressive vocals especially on the first verse. Another good Laiho vocal performance would be the chorus of Platitudes and Barren Words witch is very catchy and, in my opinion, one of the few true moment of rawness on the Hexed album. Knuckleduster remains a more, still good polished version of its TL&S counterpart despite the little lack of depthness. I Worship Chaos introduced the Drop-B tuning and brought back de D-flat tuning of Something Wild. This trend continued on Hexed, except for This Road and Glass Houses. The Drop-C/D tuning combination of the pre-I Worship Chaos albums made the sound a bit more power/thrash oriented, the new downtuning approach transform it in a more mysterious, darker, and blackier way stabilizing the melodic black metal oriented form that the band took after Relentless Reckless Forever. Kick in a Spleen and Hexed are songs that represent very well this sonical approach. The title track even have few neoclassical elements in it and probably the best key/guitar duet of the whole album. Even if some solos are easily forgettable compared to previous efforts, the riffing is quite good and very often more memorable. It\u2019s pretty uneasy to notice this, but it\u2019s a quality needed to be mentionned. \n\nIn general, the farewell album of Children of Bodom, Hexed, is a more friendly effort, not going too much deep in the band signature sound, but delivering something quite decent, despite its flaws. However, the new Bodom After Midnight single showed us that the idea pit of the Laiho crew was not completely out of good original content. So, was Hexed a weak link between the past and what would have come next ? I guess we will never know the whole story.\n\n\nFavourite songs : Glass Houses, Hecate\u2019s Nightmare, Platitudes and Barren Words, Hexed, and Knuckleduster.\n",
        "\nHexed is the 10th studio album released by the legendary finnish melodic death metal band, Children of Bodom. At the time of recording Children of Bodom was made up of Alexi Laiho(lead guitar,vocals), Jaska Raatikainen (drums),Henkka Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4 (bass guitar),Janne Wirman(keyboards), and Daniel Freyberg (rhythm guitar). Hexed is also the only album to feature guitarist Daniel Freyberg, sadly it was also the bands final full-length album to be recorded and released by the iconic vocalist/guitarist Alexi Laiho before his death in late 2020.\n\nIn short, Hexed was a return to form for Children of Bodom. Hexed has seen the band return to using more technical riffs as well as more rhythmic riffs as well. Hexed feels more upbeat and engaging than the bands previous albums, I Worship Chaos and Halo of Blood. From start to finish this album is fantastic, the songwriting of Alexi Laiho is on full display with this album. In my honest opinion I don't think this album has a bad song. Somehow this album has gone under the radar of many listeners, and I feel that's upsetting because this album needs more recognition for what it is, a great Children of Bodom album that manages to accomplish many of the things that made the band great while also successfully adding certain modern metal elements to keep things fresh.\n\nHexed contains some absolutely incredible stand out tracks that manage to hold their own against the bands hard hitting discography. For instance, \"Under Grass and Clover\" might contain some of the best lyrics in a Children of Bodom track, sadly because of the tragic death of Alexi these lyrics seem to hint at a man who knew his death was coming, and he still gave us this incredible piece of work, the man truly did love Heavy Metal. After that you get songs such as \"Relapse\", \"Hecate\u2019s Nightmare\" and \"Hecate\u2019s Nightmare\" that sound as if were pulled directly from an early 2000's Children of Bodom album, old and new fans will absolutely love these tracks. \n\nHowever, on another note I would like to address some controversy I have noticed surrounding this album. Among fans it seems is if the majority of the fans enjoy the album, I did notice though many reviewers as well as certain members of the media have found the album to be mediocre. Most of the people in question have been seen talking about how the album is good but they feel as if Hexed is dominated by singles being the best tracks, they also stated they feel as if it drags on too long. I couldn't disagree more with this statement. Some of the albums best tracks are near the end and give it more life towards the end, a hard task to do, for example \"Say Never Look Back\" and \"Soon Departed\" are amongst the last tracks on the album and they are incredible, they sound the most like the Children of Bodom that many fans fell in love with. It would seem as if the reviewers never truly appreciated this album for what it is, a throwback album that kept it's modern sound. \n\nHexed contains everything new, and old fans of Children of Bodom fan will enjoy, whether it be the blistering and truly iconic guitar riffs of Alexi Laiho as well as the new addition Daniel Freyberg, the heavy bass playing of Henkka Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4, the crushing drums of Jaska Raatikainen or even the mesmerizing keyboardist Janne Wirman, Hexed has it all. Not a bad end to the bands final chapter, Alexi Laiho can rest easy knowing his last album with Children of Bodom is loved and appreciated by metal fans, Shred In Peace Wild Child.\n",
        "\nEven though Children of Bodom was one of the first metal bands I discovered upon exploring this type of music, I hesitated purchasing a record for a long period of time as a teenager. That was due to a limited budget of course but also because I liked the band's more melodic tunes with extended guitar solos and playful keyboard passages but didn't appreciate the band's rawer tracks that favoured speed over emotions. Nevertheless, I wanted to explore the group further and since no decent compilation was available back in the days, the most obvious choice was this live album available for a reduced price only a short period after its initial release. \n\nChaos Ridden Years - Stockholm Knockout Live confirmed my initial thoughts back then. The record's melodic songs work very well in concert. ''Living Dead Beat'' starts the release on an atmospheric, cinematic and progressive note. ''Silent Night, Bodom Night'' has an excellent combination of guitar and keyboard solos and summarizes the band's strength perfectly in only three and a half concise minutes.\n\nOther tracks didn't impress me that much. ''Bodom After Midnight / Bodom Beach Terror'' overstays its welcome and is missing charismatic melodies and clever songwriting. ''In Your Face'' is a song that was perhaps a little bit too aggressive for me when I was a teenager who was slowly getting into more extreme metal genres.\n\nThe instrumental tunes are technically stunning but honestly overstay their welcome. ''Deadbeats I'' is a drum solon that drags on for almost five minutes which is something that might be tolerable coming from a particularly skillful progressive metal band but doesn't manage to entertain from start to finish coming from a melodic death metal group. ''Clash of the Booze Brothers'' goes even further and is nearly eight minutes long. When most of your songs are built upon the duels between guitar and keyboard passages, you don't need an additional instrumental song that offers more of the same. The short guitar solo in form of ''Latvala'' certainly isn't essential but blends in better as a brief gimmick in that regard.\n\nThis live release however also has its strong sides. The communication between the band and the crowd is energetic and entertaining. The set list is balanced enough to cover all phases of the Finnish melodic death metal quintet up to that point. The band plays numerous brief jams that honour popular metal songs from Judas Priest's ''Breaking the Law'' to Dio's ''Holy Diver'' which can be heard in the great closer ''Downfall'' for instance.\n\nIn retrospective, Children of Bodom's Chaos Ridden Years - Stockholm Knockout Live isn't an excellent introduction to the band but a decent live album for faithful and occasional fans. I have attended and appreciated two of the band's concerts later on and it's a shame that no proper live album has been released in recent years. With that being said, the group's greatest live album will al;ways remain Tokyo Warhearts due to its atmosphere, energy and passion from the band and the crowd. If I had to suggest an album to discover Children of Bodom to newcomers, I would either go for the aforementioned excellent live record Tokyo Warhearts that summarizes the band's early years perfectly or for the compilation Holiday at Lake Bodom (15 Years of Wasted Youth) that covers almost the band's entire career. In times like these, exploring or rediscovering one of the most influential metal bands of the past twenty-five years is certainly an excellent idea. May guitar wizard, lead singer and front man Alexi Laiho rest in peace.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom's first live album Tokyo Warhearts was and still is quite difficult to find these days but has always had an excellent reputation. For once, this great reputation is fully justified. Naysayers might criticize the cheesy cover artwork, the idea to release a live record after only two regular studio albums and the short length of less than forty-five minutes. But you know what, naysayers are always whining, so you can happily ignore those complaints, purchase this hidden gem and let the music put a big smile upon your face.\n\nThere are numerous things to be praised about this album. First of all, the sound is raw but detailed which means that all the instruments sound organic, the interactions between the band and the crowd can be fully understood and even the fans have a few shining moments in form of frenetic applause, loud cheers and a few odd screams by drunk metalheads that will make you feel empathic. \n\nSecondly, the set list has excellent flow and varies from atmospheric instrumental tunes such as ''War of Razors'' over short and brutal tracks like ''Deadnight Warrior'' and more elaborate atmospheric songs with interesting shifts and changes such as ''Touch Like Angel of Death''. In addition to this, many of these old tunes, except for unquestionable classics such as the playful ''Silent Night, Bodom Night'' and the ferocious ''Downfall'', have rarely been played or recorded in concert since then.\n\nThirdly, the charisma, chemistry and energy of the band is second to none. The band sounds technically impressive yet has an image of youthful party people and this turns out to be a perfectly balanced mixture. Fans of more sophisticated melodic death metal fans will appreciate this record just as much as the shaggy dude next door who is coming home from work on a Friday night and simply wants to blast some energizing music while drinking some beer.\n\nThe only obvious downside truly is that this record is still somewhat difficult to find. But you know what, this live record is worth being tracked down as it's easily one of Children of Bodom's greatest releases and has aged particularly well. As you can see in the cover artwork, even Godzilla approves of this and my childhood hero can't possibly be wrong. These days, spinning this excellent live record certainly helps remembering guitar wizard and lead singer Alexi Laiho who left our world much too soon.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom has always been a band that has covered a wide variety of tunes from pop over punk to metal for fun. The amazing thing about these cool, entertaining and powerful anthems is that they remind of the great original tracks while also being performed in the band's very own charismatic style. The tight rhythm section, excellent melodic guitar play and playful keyboard sections shine in every song and the charismatic rough vocals that live and breathe rock 'n' roll lifestyle like few others are the cherry atop the cake.\n\nThe eighteen songs presented on this compilation offer sixty-six minutes of unrelenting, unpretentious and unapologetic entertainment. My personal highlight is the passionate take on Billy Idol's punk rock anthem ''Rebel Yell'' that has the grit that the original tune was lacking in my opinion. Despite being a huge Iron Maiden fan who will always prefer the original version, I really like how Children of Bodom managed to make the speedy, melodic and gritty ''Aces High'' sound like one of their own tunes. The tongue-in-cheek cover of Britney Spears' ''Oops!... I Did It Again'' should put a big smile upon your face if you aren't dead inside and proves how great even an average overrated pop tune that received way too much airplay back in the days can sound when given an energizing treatment.\n\nObviously, not all cover songs work perfectly in Children of Bodom's melodic death metal style. Trust's ''Antisocial'' for instance sounds much better in Anthrax's thrash metal style than with an overdose of playful keyboard sounds and odd rhythm changes. The attempt to cover King Diamond's ''Waiting'' is quite useless because nobody can quite imitate, modify or replace the charismatic vocals that make the original tune so atmospheric and unique.\n\nStill, the majority of cover songs on Skeletons in the Closet are executed with energy, passion and respect and even the less convincing tunes are at least entertaining. Children of Bodom have released at least nine more cover songs after this release that deserve to be listened to as well and might one day make it unto another compilation. This release here might not have much depth to be honest but it's a perfect record to spin at a rock or metal party while honouring late guitar wizard and charismatic lead singer Alexi Laiho. Rest in peace!\n",
        "\nThe full CoB repertoire is on display here, copiously filling out the album-buffet: mysterious key melodies on solo before the full instrumental, orchestra hits over power chords for dramatic effect, trad-metal sounding rhythm guitars and sharp tight leads aplenty, background choirs for depth perception, guitar and key leads harmonizing one another or trading solos one at a time, shrieky shouting, and drums somewhere between hard rock and metal.\n\nOverall the progressive element is more prevalent and obvious on here, with for example the prog metal tone on the keyboard solos, more so than 'Something Wild' that just sounded like complex neoclassical composition instead. The musicianship is on full display, and there isn't much to point out here: this is tight, constantly evolving lead oriented metal with solid rhythm foundations, that is spectacular with how rich it is from a purely instrumental standpoint. Such a musical project wouldn't work without super tight production. And the production, it must be said, is exceptionally good here. The guitars are virtually perfect, trimmed down to a quasi-flawless final tone, locked in with double kicks with robotic precision. The throaty bass brings depth when needed as both guitars soar high on the fret-board but offers superb presence with its highly defined tone. The vocals and drums are crystal clear, and every other instrument from any of the keyboard textures to the background arrangements provide three-dimensional depth and pristine quality sound.\n\nNow for the problems with this record (which applies to the previous 'Hatebreeder' for which there was no need to make a separate review, given how both these albums are consistent between them).\nThe use of constantly ultra basic, stereotypical chord progressions creates a faux-epic tone to the melodies. They'll use the most clich\u00e9 possible progressions on rhythm - the entire time - where anything they do for lead work on top of that never achieves an atmosphere that feels new or unique. Rather it's more like tidy doodling over beginner series of chords. The stereotypical chord progressions render this into almost sing-along poppy tunes a lot of the time. I could seriously picture little forest creatures, elves and fairies, doing happy little dances in circles to this in my head. There's also that feeling of the melodies being too linear, with a certain pick attack redundancy. That right hand on the guitarists is often flat-out metronomic, which defeats the purpose of leads in the first place (supposed to provide fluctuation rhythmtically). This, again, prevents the music from reaching any sort of depth or from distinguishing itself. In this sense, the album is both colorful, yet monochromatic, however paradoxical this might seem at first reading.\n\nAnother bit of criticism is this feels overactive. Like an action movie.  It only has one speed . It's like the music always has to be uptempo and can never slow down and take the time to develop more substantial sounding parts. 'Every Time I Die' might be the exception, and is arguably from beginning to end the most accomplished, ripe and balanced song on here. Even Cannibal Corpse for example, often considered the archetype of the formulaic band, will indeed go full-on blast beats with heaps of rapid notes playing, but they'll then slow it down and mix it up with grooves, creating a natural flow with rhythmic and tempo modulations. This here is musicality over song-writing, and it's constantly in a rush. It feels like Laiho desperately needs some sort of constant high-pitched sound going on and for the songs to keep pushing and pushing and pushing or he'll get depressed or drop into a coma or something. And despite everything that's happening musically, the album ironically lacks variety.\n\nMoreover, the songs too often feel like they're the same template repeating, with the same structure, just filled in with a new set of riffs. They don't all give that impression, but a few definitely do, which only contributes further to the sentiment this album is like  melodies on a conveyor belt , industrially shipped out manufactured goods with a sort of mechanical regularity about them.\n\nLastly, there's the fact the music  sounds too thin as a whole and might come across as lacking in virility, as it is so constantly filled with leads, whammy and pinch harmonic squealing, high-pitched squeaky keys (that sometimes, truth be told, flat out sound cheesy), high-pitched shrieks, etc. Utilizing some of those elements is fine, but when it's all there is, for a metal album this could come across as just flimsy. Besides the standard bass and the occasional generic heavy gallop on guitars, there's very little low end or grit going on at all. \n\nTaking it for what it is, there are some good highlights like the instrumental chorus part to 'Bodom After Midnight', or that 'Children of Decadence' intro as some of the more memorable moments. But this lacks the darker charm of their debut, with its wider array of dynamics and atmospheres. Perhaps the band could've done less pure nonstop high-paced Bodom, injected more variety and preserved some of the darker toned and less shallow aspects from the debut. The next records, from the mid 2000's and onward, would see the band execute a more commercial version of themselves and probably don't require the effort of full reviews.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom hit the scene with this completely frantic brand of neoclassical infused power metal gone completely crazy. This is constant rhythm guitars shredding their butts off on wild tempos, to the point the music sometimes feels sped up, like the band practiced their original compositions nonstop for months and then just upped the tempo some 20bpm faster for the album. The tracks are ridden with harpsichord/key breaks with quick power chord-driven orchestra hits to create short breaks before the next vertiginous lead section full to burst with notes whether on shredded guitar phrases or arpeggios. The guitar work is supported in the back by strings for atmosphere, and often explore darker ambiances in the midst of the usual sort of traditional folk lead work transferred to a hyper-speedy metal format with all of its in-your-face aggression.\n\nThe extreme metal aspects on the record include the occasional tremolo picking over blast beats that accelerate songs even more, sounding like outright black metal at times or rather like melodic death metal in other places, also a black metal feel in the darker minor chords used, or the vocal shrieks. The frenzied continuous double kick onslaughts also set this apart from from traditional metal. Also the constant riff/section changes, although not exactly progressive, make this a bit less accessible and a tad more niche oriented. The album is overrun by neoclassical influences, but that component is judiciously mixed into the whole and doesn't feel separate from the more extreme metal elements and they come together as one homogeneous ensemble. 'Red Light In My Eyes Pt.2' is particularly blatant with the neoclassical influence as it's more of a homage to classical than anything else. \n\nThe melodies are generally well composed and catchy and thus avoid feeling like a shit ton of notes carelessly spewed at the listener for an entire 35min plus, as they're well constructed and inspired. A lot of the stuff sits more on the playful rock-n-roll-in-spirit side, but other moments are of the more mature variety. Certain melodies will be particularly difficult to shake out of the listener's head, like 'Lake Bodom' more notably.\n\nOverall there's a nice raw debut album quality to this record where the production is indeed crisp but also a bit quaint, and both composition and sound have a more natural flair and momentum to them. This is COB in 1997 and they had to prove to the world they were the real deal and couldn't be self-indulgent yet as they arguably would become a few albums into their discography after having established themselves as a metal giant in their field. This album is a bit darker in color and feel, and it's got a bit of depth to it even (not Bodom's strong point in their career) and it's the band at their most authentic before the advent of overproduced/overly polished and quite honestly dumbed down records from around the 2000's. It's short and sweet, musically tight although prolific, and genuinely enjoyable from beginning to end for anyone who liked the opener.\n",
        "\nIn the days when Children of Bodom existed, their albums always went a very similar direction. Nevertheless, there were always two types of albums coming from bandleader Alexi Laiho, quite dark and a bit brighter-sounding ones.\n\nThe first three albums until 2000 can be classified into the darker era, while the next ones from Hate Crew Deathroll in 2003 until Relentless Reckless Forever in 2011 are from the brighter sort with their power metal in it. Only Blooddrunk from 2008 was a bit rougher and in a negative mood. With the release of Halo Of Blood in 2013, the dark era seemed to be back. Hexed in 2019 should\u2019ve also brought it back. Between these two albums though lays I Worship Chaos from 2015.\n\nWith the brighter keyboard tones, it sounds similar to Are You Dead Yet from 2005, even though the tones out of the keyboard sound new for the band here. It depicts the 2010\u2019s band era when it became clear that they would never change anything in their style, but rather repeat their previous album sounds.\n\nLaiho seemed to be inspired by Are You Dead Yet. For example, the slow track \"Prayer for the Afflicted\" is the \"Punch Me I Bleed\" here. Having one more track than their 2005 release, \"All for Nothing\" is a second mostly slow track.\n\nThe rest of the album is rather fast and powerful. What defines the mood of the songs most of the time is the keyboard. The only entirely dark track is \"Horns\". It is also the most monotonous one with its consistently fast and straight drum beat. Together with also monotonous guitars, keyboards, vocals, and no real hooks, it is by far my least favorite track on the album, even though the title track goes a similar direction, but in the end, being not that monotonous. The title track is a repetitive song, but still acceptable for me because of its hooks.\n\nRegarding the lyrics, there is not much what was new for the band back then. There are mostly common enigmatic lyrics about hate and death. It\u2019s also only the second album of the band on which is no track with \"Bodom\" in the title. The highlight here is the track \"Morrigan\" though. The official video to it shows its lyrical theme. It\u2019s about a former soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He has mentally stressful memories of his former fight against death. Morrigan is the Irish goddess of war and fate which helped him once to overcome death. After a restless sleep with the memories, he goes searching for Morrigan again. He encounters death again, but Morrigan one more time helps him by giving him a stick with which he finally can stab and kill the death. Because of this he finally releases himself from his painful memories.\n\nChildren of Bodom is known for that they didn\u2019t take themselves too seriously. This becomes clear here when they begin to laugh about an involuntary tone coming from Laiho\u2019s guitar at the end of the title track.\n\nLaiho attempted to create a kind of closed frame for the album with sounds at the album\u2019s opening and closing. That\u2019s why you hear an equal sound at the beginning of the opening track \"I Hurt\" and at the end of the final track \"Widdershins\". In \"I Hurt\", it sounds like a recording inside of a car while driving on a highway together with a sound disorder every few seconds. In \"Widdershins\", you hear the same in the background. In the foreground, you hear a noise that sounds like when you slurp the rest of a drink in a bottle on its floor with a drinking straw.\n\nI find this kind of closed frame quite random, but still better than if something like that wouldn\u2019t exist. I guess that the sounds should remember Laiho\u2019s intense touring activity with his band.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s an album that plays it safe with no steps further. But it wasn\u2019t to expect. This is just solid.\n",
        "\n(Total rewrite, original shitty version posted on November 23rd, 2006)\n\nI've touched on it before, but I just want to reiterate something I like to call \"Roy's Law\", which states \"The quality of any given Bodom album is inversely proportional to how violent the Grim Reaper on the cover is acting.\" On the great albums (the first three, Halo of Blood) he stands beckoning or remorseful, a mysterious figure symbolizing the inevitable end that awaits us all. On the awful albums (Blooddrunk, Relentless Reckless Forever) he's violently murdering somebody. Bodom was never a particularly deep band, they are famous for Alexi making up half the lyrics on the spot in the studio and he drops more f-bombs per minute than a shitty Rob Zombie flick after all, but there's a certain meta-poetry in the fact that how stupid and brainless their mascot is acting at any given time tends to mirror how stupid and brainless the music contained inside will be. The only real hitch in this theory is their fifth album, Are You Dead Yet? This one features Roy menacingly glaring at you from behind some screen, clearly inspired by The Ring, so like... does this one count as mid-murder? Is this merely ominous?\n\nThe music contained wherein this time tends to confirm both interpretations, and unsurprisingly this album winds up being something of a mess. Hate Crew Deathroll was, at the time, clearly a transition album, moving from the hyperactive \"Nightwish with yowling\" style they pioneered into a style more outwardly heavy and rooted in actual melodeath, so Are You Dead Yet? was, initially at least, seen as the logical endpoint of what they were aiming towards in 2003. In a post Blooddrunk world, however, this is more clearly a second phase to the transition, retaining some of the high flying acrobatics of the classic era while further pushing their sound into the realm of downtuned chug riffs and bare-knuckled brutality. This style wasn't Bodom's strength necessarily, but tracks like \"Sixpounder\" fucking ruled so logically there's no reason they wouldn't be good at this as well. And honestly? For about thirteen minutes they absolutely do showcase some serious talent in more simplified songs.\n\nThe opening trio of \"Living Dead Beat\", \"Are You Dead Yet?\", and \"If You Want Peace... Prepare for War\" is every bit as good as the heavier songs on the previous album and even could have made it a near flawless album if they had replaced the few weaker tracks. Laiho and Wirman's trademark dueling solos are a tad less head-spinningly insane this time around, but their ear for hooks is as sharp as ever, with the title track and \"If You Want Peace...\" sporting two of the catchiest choruses the band will ever write. And while riffs were never the band's strength (always instead shining via the aforementioned hooks, solos, and memorable melodies), I am to this day stunned that they managed to rip out a riff as fucking perfect as the pre-verse riff in \"Living Dead Beat\" after the intro. Total fucking shame that it only shows up for a few bars here and there. \n\nIt's the following two thirds of the album that shit the bed so mightily that it managed to sour those three belters and give this album the reputation as the first bad Bodom album. \"Punch Me I Bleed\" is the token slow song that shows up on every fucking record because they're desperate to recreate the success of \"Angels Don't Kill\", and apart from the monolithic verse riff (that I realize now sounds an awful lot like Cannibal Corpse's \"Scourge of Iron\" seven years early) it's just as plodding and lame as its predecessor. \"In Your Face\" also stands out as the song with the most wasted potential, since the initial feeling is one akin to that of \"Sixpounder\" with a shot of adrenaline, and the music itself borders on great from time to time, but... just holy shit this is the lyrical nadir. Alexi was never a good lyricist, but they also never really mattered or took center stage. Hell some of their best tracks include gems like \"Well I'm an asshole and I really always will be\" and \"Kill, kill, kill, go fuck another one\" so it's not like this is a new problem. But \"OH MY GOOOOD HERE'S A FIIIIGHT\" and a repeated refrain of \"I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK MOTHERFUCKER\" is just somehow so much stupider than anything he's barfed out before. The rest of the album just flounders as the drunken Finns suddenly forgot how to write a song and everything just kinda flops around with lame chugs, weak leads, and no clear direction. \"Trashed, Lost and Strungout\" is the lone good song in the back half, sounding like another lost Hate Crew jawn, but after four spectacular bed-wetters in a row it's a task bordering on herculean to get excited about it.\n\nI have a theory on why the album falls apart so quickly after the first few tracks, though I admit it's purely speculation. I feel like those three great songs were among the first written, and after a while Alexi realized that this new simplified direction is way the fuck easier to write than the complex pyrotechnics showcased on classics like \"Kissing the Shadows\" so he just stopped trying so hard. The songs feel like they came together on their own and I suspect they probably did, because the level of effort involved is abysmal here. Tracks 4 thru 9 sound like stream of consciousness first drafts that were all in desperate need of tweaking and rewrites. Like come on, \"We're Not Gonna Fall\" sounds like a filler track that plays during the character select screen in Dynasty Warriors. There is no way \"Next in Line\" is the best he could do. I know he was absolutely losing his grip on the first half of \"high functioning alcoholic\" at the time and it shows. Even Janne Wirman's keyboard work takes a back seat for the majority of the album, which is a fucking crime considering how he was always the co-headliner in the band and arguably the most talented member to begin with. He doesn't play background atmosphere, that's not what he does, he's a front and center melody carrier and solo wizard. Putting him in the background to do twinkling bullshit is like signing Wayne Gretzky and making him play goalie. They make his reduced role work on the title track and precisely nowhere else.\n\nAre You Dead Yet? is a house of cards that scatters the minute a stiff breeze blows its way. I wish with all of my heart that they could've kept up the level of quality showcased on the opening triad, because it's definitely different for them, but it's still excellent. Let it never be said that I hate change on principle. My main concern is whether or not the changes are good, and at first they absolutely are. This album really signaled the beginning of the end for a band that was once completely unique, more or less inventing an entire microgenre wholesale while reigning at the top of the pack on a macro scale. They would have a few minor rebounds here and there in the 2010s, but at the end of the day, Hate Crew Deathroll was a tantalizing peek at what Bodom could do if they streamlined their songwriting a bit, while Are You Dead Yet? is the depressing reality of what happens when they actually do.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nSomething Wild is the debut album released from the legendary melodic death metal band Children of Bodom. Something Wild was released through Spinefarm Records, they released the album in Finland on November 16th 1997, and the rest of the world on April 28th 1998. Children of Bodom were a melodic death metal band based out of Espoo, Finland. Children of Bodom's name is based upon the grisly murders that occured at Lake Bodom, Children of Bodom's lineup has seen a few significant changes throughout the years, however the line up when the band recorded Something Wild was as follows Alexi Laiho(vocals, lead guitar, and songwriting),Alexander Kuoppala(rhythm guitar), Janne Wirman(keyboards), Henkka Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4(bass) and Jaska Raatikainen(drums).\n\nChildren of Bodom have managed to create something very powerful in Something Wild. Stylistically is is in fact a blending of multiple genres, some fans argue that is thrash while others argue it is melodic death metal, in fact it is a true mix of both styles, although I feel the band leans towards a more melodic death metal sound, more so in the later albums to follow. This was the start of the bands ascension towards greatness, and it was abundantly clear right from the start of the album Children of Bodom were destined to be legends. After all Alexi Laiho is considered by many in the metal community, fans and critics alike to be one of, if not the best guitar player of all time. It is clear instrumentally the band is far more superior than most bands, while vocally and lyrically some may find the band lacking, I for one love the sound of the vocals, it gives it a more brutal sound. Children of Bodom also manage to perfectly blend the keyboard into their overall sound which gives them a different sound from most bands in the genre.\n\nThere are three songs in particular on Something Wild I would like to discuss, Deadnight Warrior, Lake Bodom and Touch Like Angel of Death. Starting with the first track off the album Deadnight Warrior, what a perfect song to open a heavy metal album with. This song allows the listener to know exactly where this album and band are headed, and where is it headed you might ask? The path Something Wild is on is fast, heavy, melodic and brutal all at the same time. Deadnight Warrior has it is all that is to be expected from the intro track. Next on the list is one of my all time favourite Children of Bodom songs ever made, Lake Bodom. This sons is what Children of Bodom are, wild guitars, superhuman drumming, catchy keyboards and harsh vocals. Im not going to give to much away of this song, describing it doesn't do the songs justice, go listen to it to truly understand what I am saying. And last but not the least is the closing track of Touch Like Angel of Death. Perfect song for closing an album with, when this song is over you'll be wanting more. Fast brutal and melodic, an almost impossible feat but these legends manage to pull off the impossible and combine the sounds of multiple genres and make it their own.\n\nChildren of Bodom will always be important to me, as Alexi Laiho is my favourite front man as well as my favourite guitarist of all time. The songs in my opinion are perfectly crafted and the band cares about the end product they are releasing, not like bands today that just push out anything to make a quick dollar. At the end of the day I personally feel this is one of the most iconic metal albums released and deserves all the praise it receives. Leave it to Finland to give us more fantastic metal. 95% is a very fair rating, id suggest checking this album out as soon as you get. a chance if you have not, and if you have go back and give it another listen. While the band may no longer be together, it doesn't mean we cant remember what they gave us in the first place.\n",
        "\nSometimes I ask myself whether the metal tropes and genres and bands I like best are what they are because I was able to listen to them with fresh, youthful ears, passionately ready to hear and to truly believe in and get excited about music, in a way that's harder to do as I turn 30. I only got into Children of Bodom in 2016, and their first three albums gave me the sort of rush I hadn't felt since young adulthood from a new metal act -- new to me, anyway. I thought that I'd picked all the low-hanging fruit within the genres I like best and that there wasn't much left. But after falling in love with Children of Bodom, despite finding out that there is in fact more great metal to be heard, I once again fear I've now heard all the best there is to hear -- because oh my God, this album kicks so much ass; I've only found one other band since then that I love as much -- and even then, it's only as much. Melodic metal just doesn't get much better than Children of Bodom's first three records, and 'Follow the Reaper' is the best of the best.\n\nThis is one of those very few albums in which every track is at least good. And there are more great tracks than good tracks here, too. There are even a couple of metal masterpieces. The first four tracks are a tour de force of melodicism, a master class in how to tastefully use synths, full of crisp, exciting guitar riffs, and so damn much energy. This album is so fun to listen to; the raw passion and sheer joy of this music makes it continually fresh. Dark yet exuberant? Apparently it can be done. It might be the center that holds the album together, in fact.\n\nThere's usually a song on every album I love that I think is unfairly unappreciated; in this case it's 'Taste of My Scythe', which is a better symphonic power metal song than 95% of symphonic power metal singles. On this song and many others, atmospheres are evoked that have the gothic, romantic-fantasy vibe of 'Oceanborn'-era Nightwish, but with a blackened, aggressive twist. 'Bodom After Midnight' is another track with synths reminiscent of a darker 'Oceanborn' in this way. \n\nSingle 'Hate Me!' is another star; it takes me back to the incomparable mania of being 21 and on a rampage aimed at who-the-hell-knows-what. It's like the embodiment of the spirit of metal. The raw energy on this track just pulsates. \n\nBut nothing is as good as 'Kissing the Shadows', one of the greatest album closers I've ever heard, a heartbreakingly beautiful masculine love song, intense and immersive -- and concluding with one of the best guitar duels put to record. I am blown away by this song; every second of its four-and-a-half minutes counts. I've successfully evangelized it to several people. \n\nUnder what sub-genre of metal does this record belong? Who knows? I guess it's melodic death metal, but the synthphonics are highly prevalent, the drumming and guitars are often more reminiscent of power metal than anything else, and the vocals are influenced heavily by black metal. There's also a kind of brooding, gothic atmosphere on a lot of songs reminiscent of female-fronted 'symphonic' acts. The syncreticism of 'Follow the Reaper' is a huge selling point to me. Like other favorites of mine, like Emperor and Epica, Children of Bodom didn't set out to make a 'death metal record' or whatever; they just set out to make a really good record, and let others figure out how to classify it. Personally, I'm not picky with how you classify it -- as long as you classify it as a masterpiece of metal.\n",
        "\nYes, I have to say it drastically. Children of Bodom used to be my favorite band. With Hexed, I already had it in my mind to buy it shortly after it will be released. The first two releases, \"Under Grass and Clover\u201c and, with some hesitation, \"This Road\u201c, made me optimistic that this will be the band\u2019s next totally freaking great album. I\u2019m afraid, it didn\u2019t quite come to my expectations.\n\nI remember that when it came out, I was ill with some bad mood and looking for some little joy and reminded the new release. So I listened to the album on Spotify and my mood didn\u2019t change. Indeed, I was quite pissed in the end!\n\nAnticipating the most obvious fact first, nearly nothing actually changed from the perspective of vocals, music, and song-writing. These things are predominantly solid like in the previous albums. Fast, (mostly) relatively complex riffs and melodies dominate the album to a great extent. The only problems are that I don\u2019t enjoy most songs on the album like I used to do and that also indeed just not every song is that good anymore also from the musical perspective!\n\nThe most enjoyable song though is \"Under Grass and Clover\u201c. The main melody is very catchy and happy and puts a smile on my face, although this melody is the only happy thing in the song. It makes me just a little bit disappointed that the song just mainly consists of the melody and there is less more to explore. The verses are not spectacular at all and the chorus is just the second part of the melody with some vocals on it. The part after the first chorus also barely catches my full attention. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a very enjoyable song all in all!\n\nIn general, most of the songs at the beginning of the album are quite nice. \"This Road\u201c, although coming quite flat at first listens, creates an epical gloomy atmosphere like on the band\u2019s first albums with the keyboard tone before the chorus (this tone comes straight from Follow the Reaper for sure!). Hecate\u2019s Nightmare has a very nice groove going through the whole song. It makes the whole song great, although I don\u2019t like the tone of the main keyboard melody. The reference to the song \"Damaged Beyond Repair\u201c from the album Halo of Blood in one line in the chorus is random though, but this should only be a side note of myself here.\n\nMy personal nightmare comes with \"Platitudes and Barren Words\u201c, also a single and pre-release. The song begins straight out of nowhere. Then the main melody entering subsequently comes out as the cheapest one they have ever done. One guitar in the verses confirms this feeling by repeating the exact same chords behind each other. The song might also be the first one with no guitar solo, instead of it a repetitive and also quite cheap guitar section in the bridge not even fitting to the rest of the song. Talking about the music, this is the worst song from the band so far! The official video released to it plays its part nicely in acknowledging this statement by showing some scenes from a supposed low-budget horror movie.\n\nFinally, there is just to mention some more nice keyboards in the chorus of \"Soon Departed\u201c. The rest of the album just isn\u2019t worth a mention, although \"Glass Houses\u201c also recycles keyboard tones out of Follow the Reaper. The rest is just there and leaves me disappointed, considering that every other album from the band makes me move all the time. This might be very personal. Still, I see some honest lack of quality in Children Of Bodom\u2019s latest release. Laiho seems to have become just a bit more lazy in terms of song-writing and seems to lose flair for fun riffs.\n\nBecause the fun just comes back with the very last song of the standard part of the album, \"Knuckleduster\u201c, which is just re-recorded from their \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout\u201c-EP though. This song really makes fun again, but as I said, the song is not a new release. I hope that Laiho will write more songs with more freaky riffs in the future again.\n",
        "\nHatebreeder is for me personally one of the best albums by Children of Bodom. Follow the Reaper is the other one. They're both very similar and yet different albums at the same time. Follow the Reaper has a more 'modern' sound and better production to it. But it is as melodic and a tad more agressive.\n\nThe album starts with two smashing songs, the title track and Bodom After Midnight. The latter one has a very cool drum intro. Both tracks are extremely energetic with phenomenal guitar work and headbangable riffs that make the blood pump. The tone for the rest of the album is set.\n\nThere's not a single boring moment on here. The songs vary in tempo without really losing the momentum of the album as a whole. That's something that did occur in later releases (e.g. Angels Don't Kill, Dead Man's Hand on You). Every Time I DIe and Children of Decadence are two great examples of how these tracks sound different without losing the listener's attention. The agressiveness of the first two songs now make place for even more melody and atmosphere. And it works perfectly.\n\nThe solo battles between Alexi and Janne (lead guitars and keyboards respectively) are always a treat for the ear. My personal favourites are the extreme fast part in Mask of Sanity right after the breakdown, and of course the end of Kissing The Shadows. What a perfect way to close out the album!\n\nThe version I'm basing this review on has two interesting bonus tracks. The first one being the single version of Hate Me! that has an alternate solo. The second song is a cover of W.A.S.P.'s Hellion. I always find the covers done by COB very curious, especially if they're covers of bands I also am really in to.\n\nThere are things to say about the artwork as well. It gives this album an extra dimension. It actually looks like the Reaper is inviting you to follow him. The words that come up in me when looking at the artwork are motionless and cold. Kinda like death. This type of artwork would disappear on later albums, only to return on 2013's Halo of Blood. \n\nHatebreeder and Follow the Reaper are a duology that form the (unfortunately) early pinnacle of Children of Bodom's discography. Some could argue that Hate Crew Deathroll also belongs in this list. To me however, that albums is some kind of hybrid of Follow the Reaper and Are You Dead Yet?. Which is nice, considering the latter is my third favourite COB album, but Hate Crew is not in the same league as Follow the Reaper.\n\nTo conclude: a similar album as Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper will never be made again. Is that a bad thing? No, it makes these two more special, more unique. The albums following this one weren't bad either. But the magic there is to find here will not return in COB's discography. And that's okay, it can stay right where it is.\n",
        "\nFor a long, long time, Children of Bodom have been discussed in critical terms. The acclaim gained by their four earliest albums largely crumbled in the face of the modernization introduced on Are You Dead Yet?, and successive efforts have divided fans. The crux of the debate stems from Bodom\u2019s mix of styles, originally layering neoclassical power metal chops over a more aggressive melodeath formula, though increasingly blunting the finesse of that approach in recent years. Band leader Alexi Laiho\u2019s raw voice and frequent lead guitar battles with keyboardist Janne Warman have often trodden a fine line between beauty and chaos.\n\nThough Hexed will not pacify all the incensed Bodom fans longing for another Follow the Reaper, it highlights an important point often forgotten in the band\u2019s repertoire. When the Finns really get cooking, the riffs are just as good as the solos, if not actually better in some cases on Hexed. Call it the influence of having rhythm guitarist Daniel Freyberg on board for his first album, but some unexpected moments come up in the rapid, biting riffing of \u2018This Road\u2019 and stately classical themes of the title track, while \u2018Glass Houses\u2019 locks into a melodic groove almost from the off and never lets up when the aggression is applied. Some may shake their heads and call the latter song simple, yet it works surprisingly well. Positively restrained compared to expectations, the keyboard playing adds an atmospheric element to the album, rather than coming to the forefront of the sound. Subtle shades, such as the eerie backing melody to \u2018Hecate\u2019s Nightmare\u2019, prove their worth and perfectly match the uncanny cover art and song titles.\n\nAs a whole, Hexed aims for a sprightly and melodic take on similar areas to Bodom\u2019s more recent output. Cutting back and restraining the leads certainly won\u2019t make amends with disgruntled shred fans, though producing several catchy songs and sterling riffs should attract others. Children of Bodom haven\u2019t produced their best album with Hexed \u2013 not with filler like \u2018Relapse (The Nature of My Crime)\u2019 and \u2018Soon Departed\u2019, as well as a few flat moments \u2013 but continue to write decent music kept afloat by excellent chops and occasional bursts of magic.\n\n\nOriginally written for Metalegion #5 - www.metalegion.com\n",
        "\nHexed is the tenth studio release of Finnish melodic death metal quintet Children of Bodom. The gap between the underrated predecessor I Worship Chaos and this output is the longest to date with three and a half years. If you expected the band to come around with something spectacular, you might be somewhat disappointed. If you were however craving for more of the same on a high level, you will certainly appreciate this album.\n\nThe song writing has become a little bit more concise and less atmospheric if compared to the predecessor. The guitar work has become more domineering and goes back to the band's early output with obvious heavy and power metal reminiscences. The keyboards are used more scarcely but sound quite versatile and progressive when employed at the right moments. The vocals sound the same as usual and the rhythm section could be a little bit more adventurous here and there.\n\nThe record's first half is particularly strong. ''This Road'' is a concise opener with great melodic guitar play and progressive keyboard layers that never overstay their welcome. This track might be the band's strongest opener since the atmospheric ''Living Dead Beat'' fourteen years earlier. \"Under Grass and Clover'' has cold and industrial verses but catchy and melodic bridges with wonderful guitar harmonies. This mixture shows the band's contradictory yet harmonizing sides and is a perfect choice for a single. ''Hecate's Nightmare'' is the record's most atmospheric track and sounds like a nightmarish lullaby with haunting keyboard melodies. ''Kick in a Spleen'' follows right after and fools the listener with an epic overture before this approach is abandoned for brutal and fast riffs and harsh screams that make for this record's most intense song. This track should find its righteous place on the set list for upcoming tours.\n\nThe record is not without its flaws however. The second half loses some steam and especially the last three regular tunes can't compete with the excellent first half and great middle section. The new version of ''Knuckleduster'' can't compete with the original version and the remix that closes the album is nervously noisy electronic music that makes push the skip button within seconds. This final song also includes a short hidden track that doesn't add anything to rate the record up either. The two live tracks feel out of place as well and a regular live release thirteen years after Chaos Ridden Years - Stockholm Knockout Live would be a more welcome addition to the band's discography. This record should simply have ended with the tenth track instead of watering it down with seventeen minutes of unnecessary filler material. If the band had been asked to absolutely record bonus material for the limited edition or the Japanese version, the quintet should have stuck to its usual cool cover songs.\n\nIn the end, Hexed is neither among Children of Bodom's greatest nor among its worst hours. The first half of the album is creative, energetic and melodic while the second half loses steam and the tracks of the limited edition are bearable. The overall sound with more guitar duels and efficiently employed keyboard sounds goes back to the group's earlier records which will please fans of old date. Those who have never quite liked the band won't become fans with this album either. Children of Bodom's Hexed is a good genre release but not worth a mandatory purchase.\n",
        "\nGenius, madness, art: Alexi Laiho is thy name. \"Follow the Reaper\" represents not only the peak of Children of Bodom as musicians and of Alexi Laiho as a composer: this album perfectly embodies the capability of the human mind to craft something beautiful, original, innovating, unforgettable, memorable, a real piece of art never to be forgotten by the generations to come. Reviewing an album of such calibre is surely no easy task, but as a great Children of Bodom fan, I'll try my best to try to convey at least part of this masterpiece's beauty through my words.\n\nThe reason to the success of Children of Bodom, hailed since more than twenty years as real innovators in the world of music and one of the most beloved bands in the panorama of metal, resides in the talent, the genius of their frontman: the legendary Alexi Laiho. This (at the time) young man was capable of mixing extremely different influences and styles (power metal, melodic death metal, classical music, thrash metal, to name just a few) to create a completely new, innovative and unique sound, so inimitable that, still twenty years after the band's foundation, Children of Bodom still stand as a case in its own right in the world of metal. \n\nIndeed, although they're nowadays universally labelled as belonging to the melodic death metal ranks, you won't be able to find a single band coming even close to resemble their style. This album perfectly amalgamates and displays all the core elements and influences of Children of Bodom's music: thrashy rhytm parts, screamed/raspy vocals (according to the case), a strong emphasis put on melody, evident recalls to power metal music, and the adoption of a neoclassical style when it comes to the keyboard and guitar leads. The music is fast, playful, technical, extremely melodic and catchy, pleasantly exuberant and never redundant, always seeking for memorability and originality at the same time, without sacrificing the technical approach even in the slightest, instead, making of the axeman's and lead composer's bravado its main strenght.\n\nThe duo composed by Alexi and legendary keyboard player Janne Wirman spends the whole time interweaving beautiful, intricate and gorgeous melodies, adorning stanzas, choruses and bridges, as displayed in each of the nine tracks the platter is made of. Even the solos, with their frequent use of scales directly taken from classical music, result absolutely engaging, su much that you will find yourself eager for more as the album goes on. The lead guitar in particular results incredibly playful and emotional, thanks to the seemingly infinite amount of expressive means adopted, such as arpeggios, tapping, wild bendings/vibratos and most of all a heavy use of pinch harmonics and of the vibrato bar, in a way that would put Alexi as a real innovator in the world of guitar playing and shredding.\n\nThe whole lot is complemented by the harsh vocals, perfectly and beautifully opposing the extremely melodic style of the music. Furthermore, this is the album where Alexi started improving his vocals, something that would incredibly benefit the music as a whole. Last but not at least, the production: and honestly, saying it's perfect seems as an understatement. Every instrument finds space to breathe and express itself at its best, resulting in a fantastic, vivid sound. The guitar tone especially, not too polished, crisp and a bit raw, makes all the songs sound even better, and perfectly matches the album's mood.\n\nSpeaking of the platter, mentioning only certain tracks seems to me unfair, as each and every one of them is top notch stuff, without the shadow of a weakness or of a filler to be found. But since I have to, I'll just say that the melodies of \"Children of Decadence\" are some of the most ingenious leads ever written in a metal song; the chorus to \"Bodom After Midnight\" is something that will never, ever leave your mind after you've heard it, not to mention the melodies played in the meanwhile; same goes for the moshpit-inducing leads adorning the chorus of \"Follow the Reaper\", while \"Kissing the Shadows\" possesses the most thrilling and gorgeous solo-battle session I've ever had the pleasure to listen to. Finally, I cannot end the review without mentioning the CD's slow banger, that is, the immortal \"Everytime I Die\", a song so famous and memorable that it really doesn't need any further presentations.\n\n\"Follow the Reaper\" is and will always be the supreme peak of Alexi Laiho's creativity and genius as a composer, the band's most accomplished result to date and one of the best and most innovative metal albums of all times. If you haven't already, go and listen to it now: boy, you're in for a thrill.\n",
        "\nThis is a somewhat less heavy release than say 'Halo of Blood', but it's more melodic. If I were to go so far as to say if this is their MOST melodic album to date, I'd have to disagree on the premise. My contention is that it's not as brutal as previous albums, be it 'Hate Crew Deathroll', 'Follow the Reaper', et al. It's like heavy metal mixed with melodic bits. They sure show their influences though, be it thrashers or composers, COB recognizes that they're main idols were actual composers. I only know this because I'm into all sorts of metal and composers like Mozart. Some albums sound like classical mixed with heavy metal guitar-work.\n\nBut all that aside, was this a step up from their previous? I would say \"yes!\" resoundingly. The tempos are pretty slow and the music just flows like water may in a river. They simply squeeze as much melody as they can on here and I'm surprised that not more people have contributed to reviewing this. Maybe it's because COB has been somewhat cliche with their past few platters. However, that doesn't take away from this effort, I actually am esteeming this quite highly. The leads and rhythms go well together. Alexi blasts on lead guitar (as usual). But this is a more laid back COB release. It seems to fall under a more maybe concept album. I'm not quite sure.\n\nThis whole release was about 60 minutes in length. It's worth the listen to though. The whole way through, that is. The vocals are similar to older releases screaming but not as aggressive. It's a milder album as I say, but it's still really good. Just keep in mind their influences and a riff or too may have sounded like something you've heard before, but don't know where. That's my view of course, though that doesn't take away from the hierarchy of COB riffs. They are solid here and worth listening to. They've dedicated their time to making one of the most consistent COB albums to date. Everything is in accordance to reason musically.\n\nIf you don't have this yet, or are curious as to how it sounds, you might want to try it on Spotify or YouTube. I'm sure you might think that they've totally slowed down (which was my first impression). However, once you get into it, you'll feel the COB vibe to it which may keep you coming back to it more and more. If it's their most melodic album, that stands to contention, my contention at least. Give it a try and if you don't end up buying the album because it's too slow for you, that's perfectly alright. But if you do like this, support the band and purchase a physical copy of the CD. It won't disappoint!\n",
        "\nChildren Of Bodom have fallen a long way since their glory days, producing uneven albums that, while always enjoyable, are more frustrating than anything else. I\u2019ve been a die hard Bodom fan since my teen years, and it was great to see them get so much recognition when \u2018Hate Crew Deathroll\u2019 dropped in 2003, but like many bands I treasured (Nightwish, Sonata Arctica, Edguy), the new millennium and its pressure to be heavy enough to appeal to the youth of the day turned this band into something I didn\u2019t like. True, I\u2019ve enjoyed everything they\u2019ve put out to a certain degree, but I\u2019ve yearned for them to return to the \u2018Follow The Reaper\u2019 sound, and I thought we were almost there with 2013\u2019s killer comeback \u2018Halo Of Blood\u2019. Then they put out just another muddy Bodom album with \u2018I Worship Chaos\u2019, still hitting that \u2018Blooddrunk\u2019 vein with no fucks given. So I approached this one with trepidation. Thankfully, I was rewarded in spades, as this is the best album this band have recorded since 2003.\n\nI think this record could be taken in one of two ways. Either people will think it insipid and lazy, or they\u2019ll appreciate its considerate melodic direction. I hope it\u2019s the latter for most people, because this is a pretty remarkable album. With a crystal clear production job, \u2018Hexed\u2019 is a smooth, crystalline attempt to recapture this band\u2019s more intricate, melodic side that was present on \u2018Hatebreeder\u2019 and \u2018Follow The Reaper\u2019, only it\u2019s played with the conviction and anger of \u2018Hate Crew Deathroll\u2019. While it certainly feels like their old stuff, this is still very much a modern Bodom album, only they\u2019ve ditched the dirty, abrasive groove riffing and replaced it with catchy melodies, subtle arrangements, and a touch of their old neo-classical flair. The album opens with \u2018This Road\u2019, a pretty typical modern Bodom tune that isn\u2019t particularly noteworthy; it\u2019s a cool song, but not representative of the album as a whole. Things pick up with my favourite cut on the album, the melodic, hair-raising \u2018Platitudes And Barren Words\u2019, and it never lets up from there. This run from \u2018Platitudes\u2019 to \u2018Knuckleduster\u2019 is crazy good. The title track is an epic monolith that references all of Bodom\u2019s past, from its tinkling harpsichord refrain to its jagged power metal riffing, this is a classic in the making. The backing vocals are so infectious, you\u2019re forced to join in. It\u2019s not optional. Then the zesty riff of \u2018Relapse (The Nature Of My Crime)\u2019 kicks in and you\u2019re fucking owned by a spicy banger that could\u2019ve easily been on \u2018Follow The Reaper\u2019. \u2018Say Never Look Back\u2019 is a somber melodic piece, and we end with the sucker punch that is their reimagining of former b-side \u2018Knuckleduster\u2019, which finishes the album off in style. That main riff is a bone breaker. \n\nI understand your skepticism regarding Bodom\u2019s return to form, because this isn\u2019t a straight up tribute to the past. It\u2019s a new age Bodom album, much more considered in terms of melodic composition, with well structured songs full of atonal key changes, sweeping displays of guitar/keyboard interplay, and of course, Alexi\u2019s hostile bark, which is as innocuous as ever. It\u2019s not as in your face as many of their past efforts. I\u2019d go as far to say this is actually Bodom\u2019s most melodic album to date. It has low points; \u2018Hecate\u2019s Nightmare\u2019 is a drag, and the first half of the record is not as inventive as the second, but that run mid-album is just heavenly, and such a shot in the arm for a band like Children Of Bodom, who prove with \u2018Hexed\u2019 that they are still a vital band.\n",
        "\nThe last decade or so of Bodom albums have certainly been somewhat of a rollercoaster in terms of quality. For albums such as 2013\u2019s return to form, Halo of Blood, there was the middling follow up release I Worship Chaos. Indeed it seems that with Hexed, the band takes a stripped back approach and it largely pays off for the most part.\n\nThe biggest addition to the album is the return of the long dormant neo-classical style which flavoured early records such as Hatecrew Deathroll and Follow the Reaper especially. Hexed is full of old school flare and doesn\u2019t disappoint on the guitar side of things.\n\nThe singles prior to release gave us a strong idea of what to expect going into the full album with This Road and Under Grass and Clover leaving a lasting impression on me. I feel a similar way with how In Flames\u2019 I, The Mask returned to old school roots too as I do here, It felt to me once I heard these two songs that their work prior to Blooddrunk was returning in full force and the album carries that momentum throughout.\n\nIn terms of the guitar work present, I believe that the addition of Daniel Freyberg works wonders to spark the creativity from Alexi Laiho and give us those dual aspects in the richness of the rhythm and scope that we have been missing from Bodom since 2013\u2019s Halo of Blood with long time guitarist Roope Latvala absence.\n\nWhat we have here is a catchy album with a tonne of riffs and melodies to spare backed beautifully by a healthy dose of old school synth work reminiscent of their Follow the Reaper and Are You Dead Yet? which work astoundingly well.\n\nLyrically there really isn\u2019t anything to hold onto here. You won\u2019t find any deep meaningful insight or anything of note to ponder on once you have finished spinning the record for the first or second time, not that it\u2019s ever been Bodom\u2019s strong point. On that subject, Laiho\u2019s vocals remain unchanged from how they have always sounded and simply put, you either love his shrill bark or you hate it. I\u2019m in the former category, I enjoy his gruff power metal shriek, not quite a growl or a scream but it once again, as always, is entirely serviceable and he sounds good enough here.\n\nThe choruses are once again hit and miss as far as Bodom goes, its a modern trapping that the band cannot escape, whilst a lot of the hooks are indeed infectious ear worms, that isn\u2019t always for the best as the lacking/juvenile lyrical content quality on offer here leaves a lot to be desired. I\u2019ll admit, I have listened to the record a couple times and I have a decent feel for it despite every song not having the staying power as their older material.\n\nFans of Bodom\u2019s earlier releases, I believe shall be very happy with the band\u2019s latest offering. You may not find depth but what you will find however is a fun record that doesn\u2019t outstay its welcome, which is laden with technical, melodic and inspired guitar work which culminate in what I believe to be their best album since 2005\u2019s Are You Dead Yet?.\n\n[Originally written for Pit of Plagues - https://pitofplagues.wordpress.com/2019/03/13/children-of-bodom-hexed-album-review/]\n",
        "\nI've had a tumultuous relationship with Bodom over the years. They're another band I've wound up consistently covering throughout my reviewing career without really doing so intentionally, mostly because they were just simply one of my favorite bands in high school, and due to my listening habits at the time, I binged so much of their material from 03-07 that I could probably play every song on every instrument from memory at this point, and I have fat sausage fingers and have never even seen a drumset in real life. We all know how magical they were back when they were basically just Nightwish on fast forward with a vocalist who had no idea how to sing/scream/breathe and the worst lyrics ever written, floating by almost entirely on insane shredding and unmatched charisma. We all know how bad they were when they dropped the melodic power metalisms more and more and started just becoming bland ass melodeath with occasional keys and nutso soloing. We all know everything about them at this point, they're one of the more popular metal bands in the mainstream and anybody with the slightest awareness of where metal is currently knows who they are and what they're about. So how are they faring nowadays after the surprisingly decent Halo of Blood in 2013?\n\nEhhhhh.\n\nI Worship Chaos is basically just a slightly better counterpart to the totally irrelevant Relentless Reckless Forever, just with some much needed aggression that that release was sorely lacking. Halo of Blood was a distinct and obvious throwback to their more melodic beginnings, acting as something of a hypothetical midpoint between Follow the Reaper (one of my all time favorite albums, if you recall) and Hate Crew Deathroll. I Worship Chaos finds itself positioned one black key further down the piano of their release history, nestled neatly between Hate Crew and Are You Dead Yet?, being a more heavily melodeath influenced album than the former but still retaining some of the overt melodicism that the latter had excised in 2005. \n\nNow, I don't necessarily hate either of those two albums. I think Hate Crew is great and AYDY at the very least starts strong with three fun songs before becoming a boring slog, and I think this one's thematic counterparts translate basically 1:1 in terms of quality. It's got three great songs hidden among a bunch of inconsequential, effortless nonsense. \"I Hurt\" is a fine opener, with some nice hooks and a damn catchy chorus riff (that \"I AM DOMINANT\" part is one of the most entertaining things they've done in ages), \"Horns\" is mad aggressive and sounds straight out of 2003, replete with some mindbending fret/keyboard acrobatics, and the title track is one of the best songs they've written in years, again sounding like something that would've been right at home on Hate Crew with how pummeling and insane it is. The keys remain prominent and the hooks are strong as hell, even the chorus is awesome, sounding like it was tailor made for the live arena. I can't stress enough that this is exactly what Bodom is so fucking good at. Clearly their power metal based beginnings are long gone, but when they fully embrace the melodeath style and filter it through the songwriting lens of a rabid wolf who happens to have human fingers and be really good at guitar, they can craft some seriously excellent stuff.\n\nThe problem arises with the rest of the album, as it flip flops between those god awful slow songs they insist on shoehorning into every album ever since \"Angels Don't Kill\" somehow became a fan favorite (see: \"Prayer for the Afflicted\" and \"All for Nothing\") and near-totally irrelevant white noise that sounds like it was written in an afternoon (\"Hold Your Tongue\", \"Morrigan\", \"Suicide Bomber\", etc). \"All for Nothing\" stands out in the worst way, potentially being the most teeth-grittingly terrible song the band ever released, attempting to be some sort of unholy power ballad that awkwardly transitions between quiet piano parts with Alexi just whispering like Jonathon Davis since he can't sing and bland plodding non-riffs that go nowhere at all. Not even the wind-in-your-hair epic dueling solos that carry the song out can save this trainwreck, it's such an awful attempt at saccharine emotion that falls so flat that it's practically invisible when viewed from the side. I hate this song and I hate anybody who likes it. Even the otherwise solid \"Widdershins\" tends to be forgotten by me simply because it follows this disaster and I just want the fucking album to end already.\n\nThere aren't a whole lot of stylistic differences between the good songs and the lame ones, so it really just showcases the difference in level of songwriting. \"I Worship Chaos\" is a total mess of unconnected ideas but they're all good ideas so it winds up being a somewhat anarchic whizbang avalanche of raditude, while \"Suicide Bomber\" is singularly focused in being keyboard heavy melodeath but manages to limp through the entire runtime without one single memorable riff or melody. Bodom is showing themselves to be an odd enigma who routinely excels when they don't really know what they're doing. The more they focus on crafting songs around a unified whole, the more they find themselves following the rules and releasing inconsequential boredom. When they just sorta say \"fuck it\" and go balls to the wall with no restraint or clear direction, they wind up gutting out memorable confetti farts of glitter and shrapnel. That's what made the first four albums so special, they were just terminal alcoholics who were really good at their instruments so they flailed around aimlessly and wound up wrecking everything in their path with flair and aplomb. \n\nThe problem with Bodom nowadays isn't that they used to be great, because that would be unfair to hold I Worship Chaos in lower regard simply because Hatebreeder is so much better. The problem is that an album like this showcases the difference between a good example of the style (specifically Hate Crew Deathroll since it adds so much heaviness to their original sound and has always sort of been the template for everything afterwards) and a mediocre example of the style (this album and most of the ones preceding it, with the exception of its immediate predecessor, which still holds up). The elements are there, but the final product is just... wrong somehow. I don't want to say it's undercooked, because they've definitely been around long enough to know what they're doing and have a solid idea of what they want to do, and I don't want to say it's overcooked because it's somehow still unrefined and it doesn't suffer from overproduction or too many ideas or anything. It's a very \"medium\" album. It's not rare and it's certainly not well done.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nFollowing the process of trying to make their sound more approachable started with \"Hate Crew Deathroll\", Children of Bodom, the finnish melodeath giant led by guitar virtuoso Alexi Laiho, released in 2005 \"Are You Dead Yet?\", their fifth full-length album, welcomed by fans and critics alike with mixed feelings, sometimes being praised for still making a solid effort, while drastically different from the band's original trademark sound, sometimes being criticized for trying to excessively appeal the \"mainstream\", taking influences from subgenres like metalcore, which was extremely popular in the first half of the 2000s.\n\n\"Are You Dead Yet?\" was the turning point for Children of Bodom's growing popularity, as it made them burst in the US, selling more than 5000 copies during the first week alone, and it debuted at number 1 in the finnish album charts, being certified gold. While undeniably more accessible than any of its predecessors, Children of Bodom's 2005 effort still makes up for a fun, enjoyable listen. Although almost none of the tracks of the platter can compete with the band's older songs in terms of composition, musicianship and virtuosism, the material recorded on this CD still manages to result memorable and catchy. Sure, the riffs are thrashier, simpler, heavier, often relying on open-strings chugging; the guitars are downtuned (drop C tuning), the keyboard presence is reduced, and there are few traces left of the band's past neoclassic influences.\n\nNonetheless, the melodies are memorable, the solos are technical and really showcase Alexi's ability as an axeman; the choruses and the vocal lines are catchy and stick to the memory easily, and Alexi's singing sounds really improved, especially if we compare his performance to those of the first three albums. The bass has a few moments to shine, think to the riff in \"Bastards of Bodom\"; the drumming is as solid as ever, there are plenty of spectacular pinch harmonics, and the production is top-notch, as everything sounds perfectly balanced with the rest of the instruments (save for the bass, which gets often overwhelmed by the guitars, but anyway). The lyrical department isn't particularly noteworthy, but let's be honest, nobody listens to this band for the lyrics.\n\nThree songs contained in this album have become real Children of Bodom classics and are regularly performed during live shows: I'm talking about opening track \"Living Dead Beat\" (featuring a really cool keyboard intro/ open string chugging combination, and some memorable solos, not to mention the extremely catchy chorus), \"Are You Dead Yet?\" (which is distinguished by a cool solo, memorable riffing, pinch harmonics bravado and yet another instantly recognizable chorus), and \"In Your Face\" (again, open string chugging and a fantastic keyboard melody, combined with catchy vocals, make up for another instant classic). We have also two real thrash-oriented songs, \"If You Want Peace... Prepare For War\" and \"Trashed, Lost And Strungout\".\n\n\"Are You Dead Yet?\" is surely different from the band's previous albums, but it still results entertaining and enjoyable, featuring some really memorable songs; purists and die-hard fans of the band's early material accused the band of selling out at this point, but again, trying to make your sound more approachable isn't necessarily a bad thing, if you do it with class. Too bad the following two efforts of the band would push it too far, ending in the realms of mediocrity and uninspired songwriting. Thankfully, that was just a phase.\n",
        "\nIf we analyze the discographies of almost any metal band, we'll be able to easily find some similarities. For example, there's always a point in a band's career, a point where they try to change their sound to appeal the \"mainstream\", to be more commercially succesful, to expand their fanbase, or sometimes just to experiment with something new. Think to what thrash metal giants Metallica did with their self-titled album; or to Megadeth's \"Countdown to Extinction\", to get the idea. Trying a more accessible approach is not necessarily a bad thing: the two aforementioned albums sure ended up being successful and interesting additions to the bands' catalogue, although subject to controversy.\n\nWhat about finnish melodeath giants, Children of Bodom? Well, they can be included among the ranks of those who tried to do the same too. \"Are You Dead Yet\" was an album that surely appealed to a wider audience if compared to previous releases, thanks to a more accessible sound that drew influences from subgenres like metalcore, while also trying to be heavier, thrashier, somehow simpler if we consider the guitar riff department. \"Blooddrunk\" continues following this musical direction, but, while the band's previous output ended up being enjoyable and fun to listen, although different from previous releases, this time things didn't go really well.\n\n\"Blooddrunk\" is probably Children of Bodom's heaviest album: the guitars are downtuned (drop C tuning) and heavily distorted; the riffs are thrashier, there's almost no trace left of the band's past neoclassic/power metal influences (think to \"Hatebreeder\" or \"Follow the Reaper\" and you'll immediately recognize the difference). That wouldn't be a bad thing, and would represent just a change in the band's musical direction... if only the songs were good. The platter is made of 9 tracks, of which only two (\"Blooddrunk\", featuring a really cool keyboard melody, and \"Hellhounds on My Trail\", whose speed and thrashy riffing sure end up delivering) can be considered really cool; \"Roadkill Morning\" is another nice, fast-paced and aggressive song; but what about the rest? \n\nWell, there isn't really much to say in regard to the remaining songs. Save for a few nice leads in \"Banned From Heaven\" and the intro to \"Tie My Rope\", or a few riffs in \"Done With Everything, Die For Nothing\", the rest of the tracklist results just pretty average and uninteresting. There's not much variety in this album, you get either the fast track or the slower banger; but what really kills the mood is the fact that most of the songs sound uninspired and dried up. They're not horrible or unlistenable: they're just really nothing special, and this is even more evident if you compare them to anything off Children of Bodom's older stuff.\n\nThe lyrics are quite childish and uninspired too (now, Alexi Laiho has never been the greates lyricist, but still, he could have easily written down something better, if he just tried a little harder), almost if they strived to appeal to the average teenager; the bass is almost completely lost in the mix, the keyboard presence is widely reduced, and if you add the fact that most of the guitar solos are quite subpar for Alexi's standards, you'll get the reason why fans and critics alike don't particularly love this album.\n\"Blooddrunk\" isn't unlistenable or horrendous; in fact, it has a few good moments, but the problem is that for the most part it results uninspired and unmemorable. The band strived so hard to appeal the mainstream, that the songwriting process ended up being flawed. The fact is that \"Blooddrunk\" was indeed a huge commercial success for the band, if you consider it debuted at the first position in the finnish album charts (being certified gold) and that it sold 19,000 copies in the US during the first week alone, peaking at number 22 on the Billboard 200 album charts. \n\nSure \"Blooddrunk\" is not your typical Children of Bodom album, as it differs drastically from the band's characteristic sound. If you're already a Children of Bodom fan, give it a spin: probably you won't like it if you're a fan of their early works, but who knows, you might find something you enjoy. If you want to approach to the band for the first time, I recommend you to start listening to \"Hatebreeder\" and \"Follow the Reaper\", that are righteously considered Alexi Laiho's magnum opuses.\n",
        "\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve known that Alexi Laiho is a very similar guitarist to Jari Maenpaa of Wintersun. As a longtime Wintersun fan, this means that I was intrigued to see what makes Alexi Laiho rise to such praise. However I never got around to hear Children of Bodom but after they were announced as a headliner at a festival that I will be attending, it felt like a perfect opportunity to hear this band out. Considering that they have recently celebrated two decades of existence with their \u201920 years down and dirty\u2019 tour and a big part of the playlist was from the debut album and I felt like it\u2019s a good starting point.\n\n\u2018Something Wild\u2019 is in my opinion a highly overrated album for a number of reasons, and while the guys definitely have a lot of skills, when it comes to actually writing something pleasant to listen to, there\u2019s a whole new story to be told. As the album starts playing, the first thing you hear is a simulation of a thunder followed by an evil laugh, jumping straight into a crazy riff. Soon follows guitar lead that sounds quite promising, but it is overshadowed by the low quality of the sound and the lack of inspiration in the song writing. What annoys me the most is the fact that after hearing this album quite a number of times, it\u2019s clear that this band could be so much more than it is.\n\nTo start by clearing out the Jari vs. Alexi dilemma, I can see why they are associated. Their riffing and soloing style is very similar. They are both very technical and base their songs on killer speed and grinding harshness of the guitar sound. But these bands are a million miles apart in the way the music is built. I\u2019m aware now that being a Wintersun fan will not make you a CoB fan and it\u2019s applicable the other way around as well. CoB is for lovers of adrenaline inducing, hate filled, evil music, and this album is, quite simply put, a killing spree. Where the album suffers most is in the uninspired overall structures of the songs, the cheap sound mixing and the vocals and lyrics. At the time of this release, CoB where nothing more than rebel hate filled teenagers with an unstoppable urge to burn some stages. I know that this is only a debut, and I have heard albums with cheap production before that sounded good, but here, it literally becomes difficult to deal with the shrieking that plows through your ears for thirty-five minutes. The drums sound empty and shattered, there\u2019s no depth, the bass seems to be missing completely, there\u2019s no clarity, the voice is quite simply impossible to understand and the overall feeling is like listening to music through a speaker with a broken membrane. I can\u2019t say anything nasty about the lyrical theme because\u2026 well there isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s just \u2018hate this, kill that, burn the other, and do it all drunk and in a hurry\u2019. And this is the vibe that the vocals send as well. Alexi\u2019s harsh high pitched screeches in the higher spectrum are actually pretty good and despite making the \u2018so-called\u2019 lyrics impossible to hear, it\u2019s actually enjoyable up to a point. The pointless yelling and the lower growls are where he sounds like an obnoxious animal, but thankfully there isn\u2019t so much of that going on. I know that this is only a debut and I have heard albums with cheap production before, but it usually doesn\u2019t hurt the music that bad. Maybe this problem disappears on the latter albums, and I\u2019m actually curious if this band has grown from their initial state of teenage fury, but the same depiction of death on every album cover doesn\u2019t exactly bring the word \u2018Evolution\u2019 to one\u2019s mind.\n\nIf you\u2019re a CoB fan and you\u2019ve read this far, I appreciate you putting up with my rant and I hope you\u2019re not currently on your way to buy lots of guns. If you are though, I\u2019d like to ask you to turn around and stay with me a little longer, because I actually have some good stuff to say. Where the album earns most of its points is in the guitar leads and the keyboard work. There is a powerful neoclassical influence to the music with an Yngwie Malmsteen sort of vibe to it. I was astounded to hear harpsichord sound in the middle of what appeared to be an overdose of adrenaline. Where the vocals and riffs shut up and throw some leads that somehow hover above the harsh mix you can really hear some cool ideas. Take the opening guitar lead of \u2018Lake Bodom\u2019, the classical bits of alternating guitars and keys from \u2018In the Shadows\u2019 or the background keyboard that tries and even succeeds a bit, at soothing all the tormenting rough edges of the mix throughout the album. These are the elements that make the structure of the music stay together, allowing you to see some serious potential. \n\nTo emphasize the positive note, there is a lot of skill in Children of Bodom, and I\u2019d like it if you could leave with that in mind. But the problem is that the music simply cannot be enjoyable. There are actually some good ideas in there but they\u2019re snowed under a pile of retarded badassity, horrible sound and pointless riffs, like an obese teenager sitting on a tricycle for toddlers. When he eventually sits up, you can throw the darn thing away even if it was good to begin with. It\u2019s not that they couldn\u2019t make good music, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t want to. Everything about this album rimes with a waste of potential, and I\u2019m sorry but if while being able to play baroque leads like a guitar god, you decide to revolve around yelling like a drunk, and riffing pointlessly like a maniac\u2026 then you\u2019re just not worth it\u2026\n",
        "\nMost Finnish metal tends to be good; from the Scandinavian country we have received a wide range of sounds, from the melodic and beautiful Nightwish to death metal bands, and Children of Bodom stands right there, awkwardly, in the middle, but still, gives you something to listen to for a good while.\n\nMind you, this album is far from perfect; the production leaves much to wish for, at moments the album sounds like an ear-rape not because of bad music, but because volumes are all over the place and this reduces a lot the quality of this work. I always mention the cover page artwork, and this is one is terrible, even for a band that has very questionable ones, just a black background with a hand holding a scythe; it tells you nothing! The lyrics are just as the general band; in the middle, they aren\u00b4t nothing to truly behold in awe, but, they are not bad under any standard, they add nothing good, but they also don\u00b4t take anything away.\n\nHowever, the good do make up for the bad; the instruments and composition are great; they are unique and do give some unique identity to CoB, they sound desperate, yet melodic. The general feeling and mood do give you a history of someone, a teenager or perhaps a young adult that feels lost within himself and society, and his girlfriend leaving him doesn\u00b4t help. Alexi\u00b4s vocals are quite unique; he manages to scream and growl, while at the same time gives his voice a tone that gives melody to the equation, only to be added that playing this complex songs while singing is nothing but a true accomplishment. The guitars and basses go together and in harmony and the drums do give that, light-death metal feel.\n\nOverall, this album is not the greatest of all, production takes away a lot of the quality, but still it is quite listenable and gives you a unique mood, not to mention that live performances make up for the lackluster album production. This album is perfect for those that are still not really into death metal, but need a kickstarter to get into the genre. Definitely stays with me in a good manner.\n",
        "\nWhat Something Wild unleashed upon the metal scene that fateful 1997 day is something practically impossible to get away with, even then: a practically unclassifiable quality metal release. On first glance one would want to classify this as power metal, but the super abrasive vocals would get them thrown out from the Iron Maiden fanclub president with bells on. Others might want to classify this as thrash, and one could, but they'd be neglecting elements found here that one just doesn't see in thrash. Some might wish to classify this as melodic death metal, which is incorrect by virtue of the fact that its good. Some might also want to classify this as symphonic black metal, which is also incorrect because again, its good. Not to mention there aren't really odes to the underworld nor the over-world Gods to be found here lyrically. Matter of fact, the lyrics seem incidental and more conjured up as a necessary evil, with the understanding that instrumental bands don't become rockstars. Well I have zero issue with that as 1997 was a year where the music world was still recovering from an era where the term \"rock star\" was seen as a dirty word by hipster tampon paper, but I digress.\n\nThe best way I can describe Children of Bodom's modus operandi is that of a master of Zui Quan, also known as a martial art drunken boxing. Sure, the supposed victim may look like a sloppy drunk, but each strike and blow they land are deadly and precise. I would make an additional reach with this correlation with a link to the drunken Eight Immortals, but there are only five members and seven tracks here (no I'm not counting the versions where there's an extra track featuring the band's namesake song. That's a Hatebreeder song, deal with it). In the case of Alexi and pals, the fighters are likely beyond drunk and fishing for more, which makes the technical and virtuoso accomplishments on this album even more impressive. Which isn't to say Something Wild is progressive, as the bass and drums stick to relatively simple 4/4 beats, albeit at varying thrash speeds with even some blast-beats thrown in. An album can't really be progressive metal without an adventurous rhythm section. But yes, the technique is in the melody instruments, and one doesn't need to be an expert on intonation and tremolo picking to see Alexi Laiho and Janne Warman have a bright future ahead of them.\n\nThis album has a weird sense of amorphous slapdash construction. In a world where everyone likes to throw the names of Bach and Beethoven around like he was in their Chevy pickup truck when they decided to form a band with the chick from art class, Alexi took the compositional form of orchestra music and applied it directly to metal songwriting. Well, songwriting might be a tad charitable in the case of Something Wild. These tracks are less songs and more symphonic movements. The Nail is a perfect demonstration of this, unfolding almost like a Farewell through Moving Pictures Rush epic. There is some cohesion and recurring motifs within the songs to provide a musical compass for the listener, but sometimes it's easy to forget which part of Red Light In My Eyes you're on.\n\nHighlights: I don't want this entire review to be about The Nail, but fucking A, I love the Nail. The most underrated song in Children of Bodom's history. The delightfully inappropriate mixture of Ben Hur over the intro to Nightmare on Elm Street perfectly sets the tone for the organized chaos this epic encapsulates. The swinging Pull The Plug like breakdown around 3:38 is nothing less than mind spraining, and it giving way to final salvo of Victim of Fate paced shredding madness is testament to the staying power and versatility of Judas Priest style heavy metal. The album's other highlights are Deadnight Warrior, the other slightly less interesting epic In The Shadows, and Lake Bodom, which for being written by a band who are a little rough around the edges with songwriting chops, turns out to be one of the catchiest songs in metal history. Sure that opening lick may be speedy and busy, but you damn sure are going to remember that shit.\n\nOriginality combined with quality were a rather hard thing to come by in metal in 1997, but the Finnish wunderkinds pull it off with such style and grace, despite being more wasted than the Bay Area thrash scene at Cliff Burton's funeral. If you're the kind of metalhead who hates harsh vocals, this won't exactly convince you, but this is one of the very few times I would urge you dear reader, to simply look past the vocals as a rhythmic instrument and experience the true melodies Something Wild has to offer.\n",
        "\nThe cyclical magnitude of suck that Children of Bodom feel inclined to routinely revisit seems to exponentially grow. Every time they appear to pull their collective head out of their rear end, a new, crushing misstep makes itself known. From the melodic ineptitude of Blooddrunk, with its desperate attempt at going halfway back to the band's earlier sound to Relentless Reckless Forever's general irrelevance and adherence on vacuous lower register riffage - many of us seemed content with the fact that no matter how bad it got, we had likely seen the worst of it. Especially after Halo of Blood, which in hindsight almost seems like a very effective trolling attempt on the band's part, the monumental failure of I Worship Chaos was a new low, and one that I don't think they can ever recover from, even with the acquisition of Daniel Freyburg - who as we tend to forget, was wholly misused by Norther right before they keeled over. Are we at the eleventh hour of this entire shitshow?\n\nThe fact that Laiho was fond enough of this title track to release it as an advance single truly speaks to the sponge-like consistency of his grey matter these days. Take the most faceless, awkward sounding moments from earlier failures, say \"Done with Everything, Die for Nothing\" from Blooddrunk, extract the guitar solos along with any semblance of lead guitar dexterity. Next, add more of Wirman's sleepwalking, out-of-key synth stabs that clearly attempt to plagiarise \"Hate Me!\" and we are getting close to how hard this fails. It really does consist solely of the main riff stitched together by the synth transitions, along with a tacky keyboard solo that directly copies earlier efforts - same note patterns, just played in a different, less appealing key. \n\n\"I Worship Chaos\" gives us more of that forced pentatonic dissonance that nobody but the band has ever seemed to ask for. At barely over three minutes, this was clearly slapped together in the studio in about forty-five minutes, just like about half of the record it occupies. It tries checking all of the requisite boxes, but misses the most important one in the process. The banter at the end of the track almost seems like it was tacked on to make it seem like the song was just a \"jam session\" sort of thing; just for fun. I'm not enjoying myself.\n",
        "\nHate Crew Deathroll enjoys a rare fan consensus, considering it a passable transition album into the more then-modern inflected style Children of Bodom continued to toy with intermittently over the last fifteen years. Looking at the raw melodicism of Follow the Reaper, this album couldn't hope to match it at face value, but it retained enough of these elements to strike a particular chord with fans both then and now, especially in light of what came afterward. Some of Janne's best soloing is present on the album, and while their then-burgeoning fame was beginning to overcook the compositional stew, atmosphere was hardly at a premium by this point, and the opener \"Needled 24/7\" was a worthy first strike, although not my favorite cut from the album by any means.\n\nWorth packaging as the album's representation on a picture disc? Maybe, especially since the tune got shafted somewhat because the music video was subsequently disowned by Children of Bodom and became arguably obscure as a result. I sort of understand this decision, as it feels rather disjointed and without an actual plot - just lots of circus performer footage that felt out of place despite fusing on a surface level with the chaotic delivery. The main melody of the tune is simple yet searing, much like \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout.\" It works well enough, although \"Sixpounder\" enjoyed a more successful standalone iteration.\n\nThe Slayer cover \"Silent Scream,\" alternatively, feels much like a half-baked \"gimme\" unlike the band's more daring choices during this period like \"Don't Stop at the Top\" and \"Aces High.\" Fast, aggressive and boring, it opens with a riff shockingly similar to \"Needled 24/7\" and Warman's keyboard solo is tacky sounding, mindless scale runs. Elsewhere, there aren't enough synths to make the tune stand out from the original. Generally a waste of time, but at least listenable. For collector's only, if that.\n",
        "\nIt seems as if Children of Bodom became very disillusioned sometime around 2003-2004, and thus initiated a series of shark-jumping lapses in intelligence that continue sporadically to this day. One of the biggest \"collective\" offenders, as it were, is the insistence of recording these cover/joke songs that contribute nothing but dodgy filler for promos, singles and Japanese pressing bonus tracks. Children of Bodom are a band without many actual unused songs, potentially due to the aforementioned decision along with their tendency to re-purpose scrapped song sections - thrifty but not a positive aspect in this context. One outlier example that goes against this trend is the re-recording of \"Talking of the Trees,\" which was ready to go on Something Wild but tossed aside, with only certain sections later appearing on \"Mask of Sanity.\"\n\nAnyway, this particular EP is of some note due to its place in the timeline, the fact that there is a fair amount of material on it and the lack of overtly retarded cover choices. The two cover songs are still entirely dispensable, leaving us some B-roll footage of the band getting pissed and the two songs proper. To get \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout\" out of the way first, its a killer cut and good choice for the requisite music video. Compact, lithe and with a pretty decent groove in spots. Plus Jaska was at his best on Are You Dead Yet?, his fills scattering all over the place and locking well into the beat. He was definitely in his comfort zone here. Also, and as probably mentioned before in my reviews, the band was still a fine act lead-wise at this juncture. Keyboard solos are on par with Hate Crew Deathroll and the band just sounds very focused, maybe because they had lost a fair bit of their \"shoot from the hip\" compositional mindset by this point.\n\nThis leaves us the biggest point of interest: \"Knuckleduster.\" Yes, this is the only proper Children of Bodom song not to appear on an album that we have access to, and its fucking awesome! Sounds like something that would have appeared on Hate Crew Deathroll, with some loose, rangy grooves and one of Alexi's best solos. The atmospheric, well-timed synths give it flair that the band simply lacked afterward. Definitely worth tracking down if you were partial to the band's sound during this timeframe. Redundant nowadays, Trashed, Lost & Strungout still has some appeals. Not the worst thing to find in a bargain bin.\n",
        "\nI'll be the first to say that I've written this album off in the past, seeing as it's the Children of Bodom release that isn't an ultra-skilled but disorganized debut (Something Wild), it's not the slightly more extreme crossover (Hatebreeder), it's not the shredfest pinnacle (Follow the Reaper), it's not the big stylistic change (Are You Dead Yet?), and nor is it any of the \"comeback\" albums that followed Blooddrunk in all their slightly varying styles. In one sense, this is a transition album and in another it's a fourth solid step forwards for Bodom, since there are some elements of their early sound that are abandoned here, while Alexi Laiho and co also incorporate some new styles that haven't really come back since 2003. I've also written this off before because there isn't one specific standout song to pick from the nine cuts, though I have to admit that a lot of them are pretty good and nothing is really dispensable.\n\nSo, as for those stylistic changes I mentioned, Children of Bodom started off as a hyperactive, shred-happy power metal outfit spliced with a bit of melodeath flair and brutality, though sound much less pure on Hate Crew Deathroll than they did at their inception, which was probably to do with a lot more recognizable power metal in the mix. Here, the guitar tone is consistently heavier (and less sharp) than their earlier releases, backed up with a punchy drum mix that gives the band a foothold in the modern metal/thrash arena, of which post-reunion Exodus are a fair example, not to mention the Americans like Trivium and The Black Dahlia Murder, who made use of modern production techniques to slam listeners around in wholly tangible way - through the power of the mix. What marks CoB out from those American bands is that the melodies are still a big part of the music, 'Bodom Beach Terror' whirling about in the high registers like In Flames and Stratovarius were fighting for control of a twin guitar attack, the keyboards of Janne Warman picking the side of the older Finns. A summary sentence for those who struggled through those comparisons: Hate Crew Deathroll has a modern sound but an over-the-top, cheesy sense of melody.\n\nWhat makes me feel pretty happy with the album despite those potentially troublesome features is that Bodom go at the riffs like neither a melodeath nor a power metal band, often injecting the heaviness from a thrash point of view, as on the ruthlessly heavy title track and 'Chokehold (Cocked 'n' Loaded)', which fires off like Artillery just got pissed off at The Crown, which is a sound more bands should really have a go at. On the more delicate likes of 'Triple Corpse Hammerblow' (which, from the title, shouldn't be as melodic as it turns out), the speedy power metal that kicks things off with Warman's twinkly keyboards sets up a catchy backbone for the song - made much less catchy by Laiho's raw shouted vocals - before the band reconfigure the rhythm into a thrash pattern, adding in small moments of melodeath and true death metal to make a four minute song into a much busier and more diverting listen than one might think. The tactics rarely change across the release, although the riffing and winding melodies of 'Lil' Bloodred Riding Hood' end up catchier than everything else. Happily, many of the songs follow this attacking format, barring the groove riff that sets up 'Sixpounder' in bludgeoning style, meaning the album as a whole has plenty of aggression and pace to propel it forwards, even if it does end up rather chaotic.\n\nAs usual with Bodom, I have the criticism that the album sounds a little out of control and tends towards exhausting despite a length of just 37 minutes. This is because there are very few changes of pace in the songs, with 90% of the experience taking place at high speed and minimum subtlety, which doesn't really suit for all situations. The only song that notably changes direction is the longer 'Angels Don't Kill', which is mercifully positioned right in the centre of Hate Crew Deathroll to provide a necessary breather during the high-octane antics. Unfortunately, 'Angels Don't Kill' is probably also the weakest song on offer, chugging around with little in the way of interesting riffing, though I suppose that any song requiring Laiho's vocals to pull it through is unlikely to pass muster. As a result, I don't find myself in the mood for experiencing this too often, but when I need something to rip my head off and smash it into my balls, this does the trick pretty well.\n\nHate Crew Deathroll really shouldn't be written off as a great CoB record and in fact shows the band using their trademarked formula at just about maximum intensity and effect. I can give big thumbs up for 'Chokehold', 'Hate Crew Deathroll', and 'Needled 24/7', all of which go into the category of songs to definitely play while stripping the wallpaper in your house, while the melodies on display are bright enough to make you agree to your partner's terrible choice of pastels for the new paper. Except for the disappointing slower song ('Everytime I Die' was certainly a better mid-pacer), there's a lot of fun to be had and the bonus cover of Slayer's 'Silent Scream' sounds great with a few keyboard solos in it, although it's a bit sad that my CD version can't be ripped onto my computer and thus to ITunes because of some silly copy protection. Whatever, it just means that my parents' house can feel the full force of Bodom whenever I'm back here.\n",
        "\nThis is what many consider to be Children of Bodom's finest hour - certainly no small claim. Hatebreeder's position in the timeline for the most part reflects the quality therein, existing as some sort of Frankenstein-esque amalgamation of disparate ideas thrown together in a manner somewhat-redolent of the debut. And while Something Wild suffered from a lack of coherence and unappealing/inconsistent track order, most of that is rectified here. Although generally a very spastic-sounding release by most standards, Hatebreeder effectively melts the band's earlier manic intensity into its more agreeable base forms. The end result is an album with a varied, yet lethal array of armaments at its disposal. This should be seen as the archetype of Children of Bodom's early sound.\n\nAlthough Follow the Reaper trumps this one on raw melodicism alone, the suffocating nature of said record's incessant lead guitar/synth tandem tended to bottleneck the veracity of the rhythm constructions. Here, we get an overall grimier, dangerous sounding record with upfront, clicky drums and a guitar tone that strikes a near-perfect balance between loose, jangly leads and airtight, snappy distortion. The numerous breaches of then-genre protocol really give Hatebreeder a virile identity that persists to this day, be it the blasting, circuitous discord of \"Warheart\" or the low-end thrashing of \"Wrath Within.\" (the latter exhibiting a sound rarely pursued by the band later on) The album strikes the anvil while the style is still malleable enough to conform. And it isn't as if Children of Bodom have any pretensions of becoming trendsetters here - it is simply the manner in which Laiho's drug-and-drink fueled ambition played out.\n\nEven more agreeable to my ears is the fact that each track here has a distinct identity, be it the ironically \"pirate\" sounding main riff to \"Silent Night, Bodom Night,\" the perfectly-placed \"Fuck!\" in \"Black Widow,\" the aforementioned thrashier intensity of \"Wrath Within\" or the resplendent, melodic drawl of \"Downfall;\" there are simply too many timeless cuts to take proper account of in this writing. The neoclassical edge to the melodies remains as a clear carryover from the debut, although this time the balance is struck with more verve. Laiho also attempts that bellowing, decipherable \"singing\" style on many tracks like \"Warheart\" and the title track, which bifurcates the vocal monotony somewhat. Wirman is also somewhat restrained here compared to later work, injecting a crafty barrage of throbbing string ensembles and the ever-loved orchestral hit. Keyboard solos are more scarce than one would think, but are executed with finesse that Janne simply doesn't care to recreate nowadays.\n\nAnd a final mention has to be made of \"Downfall,\" which should be seen and appreciated as a precursor to the mid-paced atmospheric cuts that Children of Bodom have included at least one of on every album since. \"Everytime I Die,\" \"Angels Don't Kill,\" \"Banned from Heaven,\" \"Prayer for the Afflicted -\" all can be traced back to this point of stylistic germination. Hatebreeder is more fun than a barrel of monkeys, and while my personal taste dictates that it can't possibly top Follow the Reaper, I can't bring myself to rate it any lower. So much of the current melodeath scene can be traced back to this point that it can't be seen as anything less than a genre innovator. Timeless.\n",
        "\nLooking back at this time period, there wasn't a whole lot of anticipation for Relentless Reckless Forever, at least in the circles that had any sense of discernment. Blooddrunk sorely disappointed me, and leading up to that record, the anticipation was huge when \"Tie My Rope\" finally leaked. It turned out to be a real dud of a track with elementary, out-of-place keyboard sections, so \"Shovel Knockout\" wasn't looking like much to give a shit about at face value, but it actually has a lot to offer and is one of the highlights of this period in the band's staggered de-evolution.\n\nFor one, the rawer production value of the record works fairly well with the song's off-kilter, yet memorable main riff. The track grooves as much as it thrashes, exhibiting a more comprehensive dichotomy than the rest of the record, which tends to wallow in irrelevance (\"Cry of the Nihilist,\" \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\") or somehow manages to be fast and boring (\"Northpole Throwdown\"). Laiho's leads are acrobatic, yet restrained compared to the more spastic early material - so basically like Are You Dead Yet?'s better bits. The keyboard/guitar tandem around the two-minute mark with the supple pinch harmonics serves as a striking compositional component that effectively leads into the solos, which also stand out as being one of Wirman's few decent bits in the last decade. Dude just totally jumped the shark and does almost nothing interesting anymore.\n\n\"Shovel Knockout\" is definitely a track to add to your Children of Bodom collection, even if you aren't particularly partial to the later material. I generally extract this, \"Was It Worth It?,\" \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\" and maybe the title track when making a mix of the band's better songs. It's a full-bodied and manic diversion into the strange headspace the band was in at the time, with Laiho calling out the naysayers that had amassed since the two records before Relentless Reckless Forever. This was just a bizarre time for the band and its fans, and I always find it interesting to reflect on such.\n",
        "\nFeels like since forever even the Bodom fans I know have been calling this godawful and \"so different to anything they've ever done.\" And I just have to scratch my head and go \"Whaaa?\" Come on guys this isn't that bad. The band came out as Marilyn Manson fans? Well they came out as Slipknot fans too despite Bodom being the band Slipknot should be. As long as they don't sound like either of those two boring entities, it's fine by me. \n\nI think part of the problem is the difficulty of Bodom's classification. They aren't melodic death metal by virtue of the fact that they don't suck. They aren't symphonic black metal, again, by virtue of the fact that they don't suck. The folks at Banger Films attempted to classify them as thrash, which I is slightly more accurate but it still feels like something is missing. The biggest Bodom obstacle for most people is the vocals, and if Alexi sang properly or had Hansi Kursch or Floor Jansen and changed nothing else people would have no problems calling them power metal. They're one of the very, very few bands that you can't really place in a sub-genre box. Plus, unlike say, Faith No More or modern day Enslaved, they don't sound like a bland, directionless \"jack of all trades\" band and manage to, for the most part, fly the flag of true metal in their own unique way. Perhaps I could say people are whiny that the blast beats are gone (all the better for it in my opinion, blast-beats are kind of dumb even when done properly in black and death metal and they really didn't belong on CoC albums), but they've been gone for a good four albums now.\n\nNonetheless, no this album is not a return to the Something Wild through Follow The Reaper days but it is a much, MUCH better result than the mallcore/nu-metal attempts of Are You Dead Yet. There is nothing here that comes close to the sheer awfulness of In Your Face. Tie My Rope? Tie My Rope is goddamn brilliant and doesn't sound like a Use My Third Arm knockoff. Plus there is the whole NOT incessantly chanting \"I don't give a flying fuck motherfucker\" like some middle school edge-lord. Bodom's cursing should always be more of a ventilation of the alcohol that fuels the Bodom Void Droid (identify that reference, win a prize).\n\nIf there is any criticism of the album that I agree with, it's that some of the songs are easily forgettable. LoBodomy has been played at least 17 times on my iTunes and I couldn't for the life of me tell you a note of that one; same story with Done With Everything, Die For Nothing. Blooddrunk and One Day You Will Cry on the other hand, are extremely memorable, riff based modern metal songs done right. Sure maybe there is a bit of Lamb of God-isms in the drumming of the title track (and maybe a few other places), but again, it's done correctly here. It helps if you don't find solos boring Randy. Other highlights include closing thrasher Roadkill Morning and the aforementioned Tie My Rope which sounds like a Mortal Kombat/Killer Instinct song gone drunkenly wrong in a way only Bodom can manage.\n\nEven though the band still performs the odes to flaccid chuggery known as In Your Face and Living Dead Beat live, it is apparent that they learned from the modern songwriting mistakes from the previous album. If Hate Crew Deathroll was British Steel, a streamlined and simplified to fault approach, then Are You Dead Yet was Point of Entry, and this is Screaming For Vengeance (aside Stained Class and Sad Wings to which ever old Bodom album you like best). That dear reader, is fine by me.\n",
        "\nRelentless Reckless Forever sure was a weird one, wasn't it? Looking back to this time period, it seemed like most people had given up on the band after the haphazard \"middle-ground\" of sorts that was Blooddrunk; and once the band premiered \"Was It Worth It?\" complete with ridiculous music video aimed at fucking 14 year olds who chug cough syrup to get high, most of us had the gall to call it quits on the entire affair. And the album? Surprisingly decent in spots, particularly \"Shovel Knockout\" and this single cut here: \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back.\" In fact, I kind of prefer Relentless Reckless Forever to Blooddrunk because the melodies sound more fleshed-out, even if a large chunk of the record is completely and totally forgettable. \n\nStill, the band excels on the slower, more atmospheric numbers, so \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\" was naturally a standout. Deliberate, pseudo-groovy, fluid and powerful, it sort of hints at what would come down the pike with the next album Halo of Blood, which in hindsight hasn't aged too well compared to the initial consternation and hype. Also worth noting on this single is Janne's last true moment of glory (at least to date of this writing) - the outro keyboard solo is emotive as hell, which I prefer to straight shredding, reminding me of my all-time favorite keyboard solo: \"Bodom Beach Terror.\" It's the highlight of the album, at least to my ears as a keyboardist.\n\nAlexi is his usual constipated, barking self with complete shit lyrics, but there are generally enough hooks to sink in with this song, which is probably why it was released separately, albeit with a pointless cover tacked on the B-side. Nothing to say about that, just a complete waste of time, as was this review since I should have just rewritten my original appraisal of the album proper. But hey, too late now.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom is (was) a killer band. The first four albums are staples of melodic death metal and absolute classics. Hate Crew Deathroll was the point when things started to shift for what was not the better. While they managed to recover from Are You Dead Yet; which is total trash. Blooddrunk has certainly not been their best effort. It has some good songs with some cool parts but its much different than the originals. With all that said if you separate them from their past and listen to this album by itself its not bad. Blooddrunk does suffer from a bit of an angry child trying to flip the bird to the world syndrome but there were some solid moments to it. Tie My Rope, Done with Everything, Die For Nothing, and Smile Pretty for the Devil all were definitely better songs on the record. And Banned from Heaven reminded me a lot of Angels Don't Kill so that was a good bonus in my book.\n\nSo what does it sound like? Blooddrunk is definitely still Children of Bodom. There's still good riffs, guitar solos, cool synth parts in the background and some good harmonies thrown throughout. This record like the one that preceded had more of a rock 'n' roll feel to than the previous classical influence the others put forward. In and of itself this wasn't a bad thing but I feel like they might have reached for something they couldn't quite achieve. Admittedly there are some songs that are kind of so stupid they become really fun to jam out to. For example read the lyrics to Roadkill Morning and you'll gain an appreciation for what's there. So overall I'd say the album is worth a listen, maybe not worth the buy. If you can purchase a few tracks digitally I'd recommend that over getting the whole package. (I'd give a 65% overall though the four tracks mentioned: Tie My Rope, Smile Pretty for the Devil, Done with Everything, Die for Nothing, and Banned from Heaven I'd give an independent 75% to).\n",
        "\nLove for Children of Bodom is rather in scant supply these days, but Alexi Laiho and his cohorts were known to own a heart or few a couple of decades ago. Their appeal probably lay in their fairly unique cross of genres: by no means the only power metal band to include melodeath elements (or was it the other way round?), their high-speed, triumphant sound avoided most of the clich\u00e9s of both genres, while the surprisingly harsh vocals led to fewer lyrical hooks though the added brutality countered the occasionally flowery sound of such melodic material. It's difficult to say (for me at least) whether CoB really ended up worse off for their transition towards more modern and accessible waters, yet it is evident that an album with such dominant lead instruments as Follow the Reaper hasn't been repeated in recent years.\n\nI always used to find early CoB rather too chaotic to be totally enjoyable, something that I still find these days. There really is a lot going on in terms of melodies, riffing, rhythms, and vocals all coming in loud and fast almost all the time. I think the problem for me is not that the individual components are unworthy or unpleasant, but more the fact that they all pound in at the same kind of frequency (this is a high-pitched album if ever there was one), with shrill, trebly guitars fighting against crisp, slapping drums and higher yet slightly sweeter keyboard sounds, all topped off by Laiho's gritty snarl, which probably diverges from the usual trend of screamers to be low because of his smaller stature and the pace of the lyrics. Therefore, listening to CoB for an hour is probably a very tiring experience, though it's fortunate that most of their albums are around 40 minutes in length, as is the case for Follow the Reaper. Also useful in this regard is a song like 'Everytime I Die', which takes a more laidback approach to the same material, allowing the melodies to breathe and drive the song instead of throwing everything at the listener as fast as possible, an approach which occasionally makes for an uncomfortable experience and robs the leads of some of their effect.\n\nAs such, I'm not disagreeing that the Finns are an accomplished bunch of musicians (I sure wish I could play this fast), though it just goes to prove that chops aren't everything. Calling guitarists Laiho and Alexander Kuoppala anything but stars of the show would be incredibly cruel as they drench every song with a buffet selection of diverse riffs, alternately soaring/screeching melodies, and many blistering leads; however, it would also be churlish not to admit how much of an impact Janne Warman has on the sound of these songs, intertwining the busy guitars with his own melodic touch and going off on a similar number of equally exciting solos. Personally, I find them slightly less cool than the guitar leads, but then again I'm not generally a keyboard fan. What all this adds up to is a shitload of notes per minute, so anyone not keen on ballads is going to be very happy, something that Jaska Raatikainen endorses by playing a comparable shitload of beats. He doesn't exactly get many standout moments, though the fill that opens 'Bodom After Midnight' is pretty damn tasty, while Henkka Blacksmith even finds time to make himself known with brief bass solo slots during 'Hate Me!'.\n\nThese two opposing feelings of overdone energy and excellent musicianship have also been cited as the reason why Dragonforce have not met with universal approval. Naturally, CoB have more of an overt extreme element to their music, what with the harsh vocals and generally darker tone, though the brevity of their songs is an additional reason to choose the Finns over their more long-winded competition. The reason I bring up this comparison is because I feel that the frenzied nature of some of the compositions here harms instead of helps Bodom's aims, leaving me slightly lost at moments in the album, when I fail to remember which song I'm listening to, just as when I listen to Dragonforce. CoB's melodies and riffs - while certainly not all the same - tend to be of the same type, something that the harsh production emphasizes, adding to the feeling of discomfort that I mentioned earlier. As a result, I can't always enjoy this as the musicianship and songwriting deserves, leaving me with mixed feelings about the overall quality. There are no especially poor songs, 'Bodom After Midnight' and 'Kissing the Shadows' being marginally the pick, though I don't find it easy to select individually enjoyable tracks, even if there are plenty of entertaining moments.\n\nMy overall impression of Follow the Reaper therefore probably seems rather confused, which would be an accurate summary of my feelings. I appreciate the stellar musicianship and would possibly go so far as the say that CoB's instrumentalists were at their highest quality here, as well as producing the finest leads and most persistent melodies of the band's career. That said, I prefer individual songs from most of their other full-lengths, such as the memorable 'Lake Bodom' and 'Bed of Razors' from the earlier releases, as well as 'Next in Line' and 'Hellhounds on My Trail' from the maligned later period. In conclusion, I think that this should be Children of Bodom's best album, yet I can't bring myself to actually say that it is.\n",
        "\nTwo of Finland's most iconic metal bands join forces on this split record released with German metal magazine Legacy. Melodic death metal legend Children of Bodom promotes its new output I Worship Chaos while progressive metal icon Amorphis underlines the release of its Under the Red Cloud record. The former album is very good while the latter is even excellent and I can only recommend purchasing both. However, fans with smaller budgets get a good idea of the type of music these two bands represent while collectors get some rare and even exclusive material.\n\n''Suicide Bomber'' is taken from Children of Bodom's I Worship Chaos release and presents the band's typical sound where melancholic instrumental sections dominated by mysterious keyboard sounds and longing guitar melodies meet faster passages with harsh vocals. The song is far from being outstanding but an appropriate introduction to the band. The song is good average overall but clearly the weakest track on this release. The live version of ''Halo of Blood'' was recorded live at Summer Breeze Open Air 2014 and is exclusive to this release. This live rendition has even more punch than the studio version and is one of the band's fastest and most sinister songs recalling melodic black metal soundscapes. This unusual song in its energizing version presents the harsh and serious side of the band very well. Children of Bodom has always been a band that has managed to cover tracks of numerous genres and make them sound like their own tunes which should be the purpose of any cover track. This is also the case with its version of Amorphis' ''Black Winter Day''. It keeps the melancholic and mysterious undertone of the original but adds some more dominant keyboard parts, faster rhythm sections and meaner lead vocals. This balanced approach should please to fans of both camps since the original track is treated with a lot of dignity, passion and thought. In the end, we get one average, one good and one great track by Children of Bodom as the split release just keeps getting better and better.\n\nInstead of offering a new track from its latest studio record, Amorphis kicks off its part of the split release with a rare bonus track from the Circle recording sessions called ''Illusion''. Aside of avid collectors, many people might not be familiar with this track yet. It's one of Amorphis' harsher tracks in recent memory. Tomi Joutsen's charismatic vocals vary from fierce black metal screams over thunderous death metal growls to powerful clean vocals and his diversified and inspired performance alone is already worth listening to the song. The middle section featuring keyboard and guitar solos shows off the band's melodic progressive metal side. Aside of these two elements, the song is rather unspectacular musically and can't keep the incredible high level of the regular Circle album. Amorphis' decision to keep this tune as a bonus track was the right one because it's clearly good enough for this purpose but not exactly up to the band's usual standards of excellence. It's a whole different thing for the live version of ''Hopeless Days'' which was the outstanding lead single from the Circle record. This rendition was recorded at the 2013 edition of the famous Loud Park Festival and the band's entire set has been included as a bonus disc on the limited Japanese edition of the Under the Red Cloud release. Since I own this version of the album, let me tell you that this concert is in fact the most powerful live release I have ever listened to and definitely worth your money. This particular song is an excellent representation of the band's incredible live shows. This version is so energizing that you just can't be still while listening to it. This song is obviously easily the best on this split release. Since Children of Bodom covered one of Amorphis' tracks, Amorphis also picked a Children of Bodom tune to reinvent and ''Every Time I Die'' is in fact exclusive to this release. Amorphis' version is a little bit slower, more melodic and even more atmospheric than the original tracks. Tomi Joutsen's death growls add some bleak majesty to the track which is underlined by progressive keyboard sounds recalling the charismatic organ sounds from the progressive rock scene of the seventies. Amorphis managed to make this song their own and I personally like this creative interpretation better than the original song which isn't among Children of Bodom's greatest moments in my opinion. In the end, Amorphis offer one good, one excellent and one very good tune on their part of this split release.\n\nIn the end, this split release is highly recommendable for fans of both bands. The studio songs are at least solid, the cover versions are performed with genuine imagination, respect and skills and the vivid live tunes are actually the genuine highlights on here. These two bands complement each other perfectly and seem to have tons of respect for each other. This release proves once more that Finland is overall the greatest country for high-quality metal music in the world as even Barack Obama acknowledged. Get your hands on this beauty without any hesitation and let's cross our fingers for more future high-quality split releases by metal's most iconic groups.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom's first album is to me different than what one would expect from Children of Bodom. It's not bad at all, but I prefer the albums that came after this one. The first time I heard this record, I was disappointed but I've come to appreciate it more and more. So about 10 years after I bought this album, I finally feel like I've listened to it enough to review it objectively.\n\nOverall I feel like they were still searching for a specific trademark sound because the album is a bit inconsistent sometimes. While tracks like Deadnight Warrior and Lake Bodom are more straightforward and typical 'Bodom-sounding' songs, tracks like In The Shadows and The Nail are more lengthy and more complex than I would expect from Children of Bodom. But don't get me wrong, I love those two songs just because they are so different from what Bodom usually does.\n\nIn this album, more than in other albums, you'll hear the classical music influences which I personally think is awesome. Something Wild perfectly combines beautiful melodies with the rawness of death and certainly black metal too. Take The Nail for example, it starts off with a riff that could come from a black metal album, but as the song progresses you'll hear some classical melodies when Janne (the keyboard player) shows off his skills. This songs ends by the way with one of the best solos Alexi has ever played. Those sweeps are insane, taking into account that he was only 18 when this album came out. It's too bad that they never play this song live.\n\nOther tracks are Red Light In My Eyes Part 1 and 2, which in my opinion are mediocre songs. In part 1 there's a nice guitar solo, but I find the chorus a bit annoying. In part 2 there's an awesome moment from Wirman with his organ sounding keyboard, but there's nothing more too interesting about the song. These are not bad songs, but I think the other tracks of this records stand out more. The album ends with Touch Like Angel Of Death and is the perfect closer for this album. After the epic song that is The Nail, Children of Bodom closes things off with some nice riffing, an awesome solo and a cool chorus.\n\nTwo things I rather dislike from this album are the production and the vocals. First off, the production isn't all that bad, but the drums are too washy. While the other instruments are really on the forefront, the drums are in the background just being there. They don't really drive the record as much as the other instruments do. That's a shame I think, because Jaska is a really good drummer and there is some very nice drumming to be noticed on Something Wild, but because of the production it doesn't really stand out that much. But hey, it's their first record and as far as I heard the circumstances while recording this album weren't optimal.\nThe second thing I dislike are Alexi's vocals. Now I know he'll never be the best vocalist in metal, and I don't expect that from him either. But on this album his voice sounds really strained and it seems like he's trying to do things with his voice that he simply can't. But he was only 18 back then and I think now he knows better how to handle his voice, even though he'll never be a topnotch vocalist.\n\nIn conclusion this album is very different from what most people are used to when listening to Children of Bodom. But that's not at all a bad thing. While the album as a whole is far from perfect, it's an enjoyable listen with some very surprising songs. It's a very good debut record written by teenagers that were still searching for a particular sound, I believe. I gave this album 85% and I still consider it to be one of the weaker Children of Bodom records.\n\nRecommended tracks:\nIn The Shadows\nLake Bodom\nThe Nail\nTouch Like Angel Of Death\n",
        "\nWhat to say about an album that you consider to be a perfect album? Hatebreeder has gotten me speachless. This album grabs me by the throat from the moment that I hear 'from now on we are enemies, you and I' until the last note of Downfall and it never lets go between those two moments. The copy that I bought also has two bonus tracks that I will talk about later, but I do not consider them as a part of the album Hatebreeder in this review. This album was a step in the right direction, coming from Something Wild. That was a great album, but it had some some flaws. With Hatebreeder, Children of Bodom produced a perfect melodic death metal record with some neo-classical power metal vibes that has set a standard for this type of music. I would compare this album and Follow The Reaper with the Keeper albums from Helloween. They brought melodic death metal to a whole other level by incorporating those power metal influences.\n\nThe songs on this album are incredible. Each song consists of beautiful melodies, awesome riffs and stunning solos. If I have to pick the best song on this album, I would go with Silent Night, Bodom Night. This song is 3 minutes and 13 seconds long and it has everything that a Children of Bodom song needs. A very nice riff that you can headbang to or even hum along with, some incredible guitar and keyboard sounds by Alexi and Janne, a breakdown where you can bang your head off and another solo by Alexi and Janne in harmony. All of that is done in 3 minutes, so you can expect that the song has a pretty fast pace too. \n\nEvery second of this album is a highlight, but some parts of songs are absolutely phenomenal. The solo battle between Alexi and Janne at the end of the title track gives me goosebumps. It's so powerful and brings about strong emotions. Another example is the haunting keyboard intro of Bed of Razors or when Alexi shouts 'guitar' in Wrath Within and then the solo kicks in. I know, it's really cheesy, but it fits so well in this song. After the solo there's a breakdown and another beautiful harmony of Alexi and Janne. The ending track is Downfall and is the second best track on the album. The intro is again an awesome haunting keyboard melody and then the guitars kick in with some nice riffing. The solo in this song again is a very powerful one. \n\nThe shredding on this album as a whole is simply incredible. Along with his performance on Follow the Reaper, this has got to be Alexi's best guitarwork. Janne does his thing with the keyboards, sometimes accompanying with Alexi, sometimes just doing his own thing. Jaska is also right up there, delivering the perfect beats to all the frantic guitar and keyboard playing. Henkka's bass sounds really nice too, although he's sometimes hard to hear through all the shredding. But if you listen to Warheart, you'll hear that low fat bass sound that's typical for Henkka and it's awesome.\n\nThis album really mixes the neo-classical components with extreme metal very well. This has got to be one of the first power melodeath albums that I believe inspired many other bands such as Norther, Kalmah or Made of Hate. If you like those bands, you'll certainly love this album. I had to think long and hard over which album is the best Children of Bodom album and I decided that both Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper are equally as good. It doesn't get any better than this.\n\nPS : on the copy I bought are two bonus tracks. One is a cover from the Finnish thrash metal band Stone, in which Roope Latvala also played. The song is called No Commands and it's fairly good. It's nothing too special, but it's fun. The second track is a cover of Iron Maiden's Aces High. The vocals aren't too good, but the music itself is really fun. It's the Children of Bodom sound, but they're playing an Iron Maiden song. That's what I like about covers from Children of Bodom. They always incorporate their own sound into the original songs.\n",
        "\nAt the end of the day, Follow the Reaper is the album most of us end up returning to when pining for a Children of Bodom fix. After over a decade of drama originally spawned by the underrated expansion on Hate Crew Deathroll that is Are You Dead Yet?, this is the one album whose melodic carapace has yet to be penetrated by the ire of the naysayers. After the raw, unfocused yet endearing spasticity of the first two albums, a huge turn was made here; one that altered the melodic death climate in ways still being felt to this day. Without a doubt the band's most melodic album, Follow the Reaper rockets out of the gates from the first few notes and delivers quality on such a scale that one would be hard pressed to find entire albums that contain as much melodic majesty as just one of these tunes, be it the breathtaking technicality of \"Kissing the Shadows\" or the more atmospheric, resplendent drawl of \"Everytime I Die.\"\n\nThis quality exhibits Children of Bodom at the top of their game musically. Wirman's approach here mirrors certain aspects of Hatebreeder, but the neoclassical slant that was so heavily emphasized earlier on is largely eschewed in favour of more standard, albeit no less complex, scale runs and thrashing, speedy riffs. The rhythm guitar surges with effervescent gusto, doing much more than mere space-filling. A good example would be the verses of \"Mask of Sanity,\" specifically the part ganked from the earlier Inearthed tune \"Talking of the Trees.\" I've heard complaints that the second half of the record drags somewhat before ending on a stratospheric high note with \"Kissing the Shadows.\" An argument is repeatedly made against \"Taste of My Scythe\" and especially \"Northern Comfort.\" The latter is the song that I hear mentioned the least, but the breakdown about two and a half minutes in is an isolated album highlight. \"Taste of My Scythe\" feels darker, making it a fine companion to \"Everytime I Die.\" A lack of melodic lines as distinctive as the majority of the album kneecaps it somewhat, but we are truly splitting hairs at this point.\n\nLaiho's ungodly rasp is in its best form here, and he still attempts the deeper \"singing\" style that was most prevalent on Something Wild. The more variety the better, and the aggression is translated affably. I was personally more fond of Wirman's soloing on Hate Crew Deathroll, but the more symphonic, power metal style he uses kicks ass here. The opening of \"Mask of Sanity\" will resonate into melodeath eternity. \"Everytime I Die\" is another stone-cold classic, and the archetypical Children of Bodom slower tune, introducing a formula that has appeared on every album since. These more mid-paced, palatial songs are always album highlights, since the band truly excels when the atmosphere is accentuated as opposed to raw technicality. Laiho has always been comically fond of pinch harmonics, but here it is taken to an extreme never replicated before. His songwriting feels more focused, siphoning the formula down to its bare essentials, and then accentuated to the hyperbolic extreme these guys are known for. The manic charisma of \"Kissing the Shadows\" is ironic, since the song was slapped together at the eleventh hour in the studio. It bounces off of the walls like the title track, as both are struck from a similar mold.\n\nEven the cover songs are the band's best, albeit at a time before they chose stupid shit just to get a rise. \"Shot in the Dark\" lends itself to Children of Bodom's style more, but \"Don't Stop at the Top\" is a surprisingly effective translation, which does the original justice in my eyes. Production values are heightened from the first two, albeit somewhat lacking in the concussive strength of Are You Dead Yet? and such. The persistent coupling of guitar and keyboard leads are emphasized most, and while the rhythm guitar suffers some presence in the mix, it actually sounds quite decent. Two different mixes of Follow the Reaper exist, and the single version of \"Hate Me!\" sounds totally different from the album version, which you might find incorrectly floating around in the regular tracklisting when downloading. It's hard to justify placing any album above this one, and I won't. Not only does Follow the Reaper still live up to the hype, it elicits a cackling joy to yours truly that few albums can. Wildly proficient and timeless, you can't take this one away from us.\n",
        "\nNearly a decade ago, I put my proverbial pen to paper and appraised the then-new Are You Dead Yet? for the first time, naturally looking at it based on where the band stood at that time. Now nine years later, I can look back and claim that I was mostly on point, which is somewhat surprising given the inconsistent amount of shade thrown upon it by the four releases since. I claimed that many tunes later in the procession were mere \"vehicles for solos\" without much individual clarity of thought or purpose, and that the lack of keyboards marred an otherwise leaden and powerful experience. All of these points stand, to one degree of another, along with the foresight of knowing how much worse the band would sound later on.\n\nA theme in many of my later reviews for these guys is the lack of memorability concerning the melodic aspect itself. While Laiho's true intentions concerning the injection of a more groove-centric, harsher and chunkier sound may never be known, the bottom line is that this only became a problem after Are You Dead Yet? While the keyboards are far too truncated at times, Wirman maintains a dexterous finger, natural considering he was coming off a career-best performance on Hate Crew Deathroll. An overall epic sound is achieved on tunes like \"Next in Line,\" with an almost sing-along refrain backed by a simple but memorable keyboards. This could easily fit on Follow the Reaper, if not for the clangy and percussive sound of the record overall. Honestly, it augments many of the groovier riffs in a huge way the thinner production of earlier material couldn't. This is best experienced on \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout,\" which while perhaps the most modern sounding song here, wholly succeeds on that front. Jaska's tight and scattering fills and simpler beats add a lot to an otherwise spartan (for Children of Bodom) tune.\n\nOther carryovers include the obligatory slower, more menacing bruiser \"Punch Me, I Bleed.\" While undeniably inferior to both \"Angels Don't Kill\" and \"Everytime I Die,\" it still displays how effective Children of Bodom can be on more mid-paced fare, a damning blow to those who harangue the band for supposedly being all high-speed flash and no substance. The vocals can be a problem, and while Laiho's earlier ramblings were cheesy in an endearing way, here it feels like a bad joke. The way he tends to hang on the worst lines really drags otherwise solid numbers down like \"In Your Face.\" While remainders like \"Bastards of Bodom\" do indeed feel like mere vehicles for solos, I find most of this album more memorable than anything that came after it. Blooddrunk felt like the sonic equivalent of the band reattaching their recently shed old skin; just an unpleasant execution overall. Even the supposed return to form Halo of Blood had those rushed, unsatisfying melodic resolutions that Are You Dead Yet? does not share.\n\nAfter I Worship Chaos, it really sets the stage to show us all what Are You Dead Yet? could have been, and thankfully was nowhere near. I think people need to revisit this one and give it another chance courtesy of the cynical rose colored glasses they now wear and see how it holds up; they might be surprised. Sure, the lead patterns may lack the incessant complexity of something like \"Kissing the Shadows,\" but they all sound fleshed out and powerful. I don't know, I just can't hate this one; not then, and not now.\n",
        "\nOut of a lot of old metal releases back in the day, this is one of the few albums that still gets me pumping and waving the nostalgia flag the most. Recent albums of the band have clearly tried to recapture the spirit and overall essence of this classic (Halo Of Blood anyone??) but in reality those albums barely manage to scratch the surface of what CoB accomplished here. Why? Because this album has such a pure and unabashed level of goddamn energy which is quite hard to find in metal releases of today. Unlike the CoB of today, the band was clearly on fire back in the day. Of late, too many close minded metal fans have hated the fuck out of this band for getting the supposed undeserved popularity that we attribute to them today which is honestly just baffling. I mean sure, I can get behind the fact that they did lose a sizable chunk of their fan-base after Are You Dead Yet, (after all, they did start to kinda suck after that) but to just casually diss their entire discography is quite honestly, taking narrow-mindedness to new heights. If you don't happen to be one of them, you may kindly read on. \n\nMore than enough has already been said about how groundbreaking and decisive this album was in jetissoning the band right into the limelight, not to mention having some of the band's prime hits like \"Children Of Decadence\" (the intro simply KILLS even after all these years, believe me), \"Hate Me\" \"Every Time I Die\" and the super-fast title track destined to stay in your head for days on end with their superb bunch of catchy-as-fuck guitar and keyboard riffs and licks along with a maniacally amazing touch of the flamboyant side of both instruments, not to mention Alexi's insane vocal work. Don't get me wrong, I only mentioned these tracks as a appetizer for all you clueless souls yet to hear this band. At the end of the day all the songs are fucking scorchers. And anyone who claims that Laiho was always an overrated guitarist from the beginning, kindly listen to his lead-work and solos on this album and say that again. Sure they aren't virtuostic in that sense, but are pretty fucking good with a righteous eye for melody and ultimately serve their purpose. And the keyboards are fucking insane - just listen to \"Hate Me!\" and especially the end of \"Kissing The Shadows\" to see what I'm talking about. Now that's freaking insane. Essentially in my opinion, this album is Hatebreeder on fucking steroids. While the previous album had instances of the band killing it, there still were a few unpolished and raw parts to some of the songs almost as if the band weren't really that sure of what they were doing. On this album, they've pulled no punches whatsoever and have fully embraced the maniacal speed and fury that some of their best songs are know for, making an album of 9 absolutely devastating tracks that leave no survivors in their wake. Honestly, it's such a damn shame I've never had the opportunity to catch these Finnish maniacs live. \n\nFinally, this is the band at their prime and that's about all I have to say. It has a really amazing charm and fun attitude about it that I can't help but dig the fuck out of, time and time again. Sure other fans may pick Hatebreeder, Something Wild or even Hate Crew Deathroll over this one and then again - all of them are great albums in their own right, but when I'm looking for my personal classic CoB fix, this is the album I constantly turn to. And I mean every fucking song. After a good 12-13 (!) years of being a fan of the band, I think that says a lot.\n",
        "\nSo come last Spring, Dave Mustaine graced Salt Lake City with his presence. He went the extra mile by bringing Chris Adler, Kiko Loureiro, Havok, Suicidal Tendencies (who FUCKING BAILED) and Children of Bodom with. Well the reason I mention this is despite being a fan of Children of Bodom's early work I had no interest in this album until I saw the title track stir up a decent sized pit.\n\nAfter actually listening to the album though I sorta wish I had remained uninterested. I wanted to like it, I really did, but when I try to reflect on all the good bits I have to relisten to the whole thing again just to remember exactly what those good bits were. Like the opening track wasn't too shabby, I enjoyed the intertwined guitar and keyboard riffs and the chorus was very catchy and heavier than Bodom generally gets. The title track also had a catchy and far more dramatic chorus, but once I get the hit songs out of the way I start running a blank. Prayer for the Afflicted was decent too, though it had more going for it than just the chorus.\n\nThere were a lot of riffs throughout the album, which no shit, a metal album is going to have some riffs, but they had nothing going for them. They were fast for the most part, but they didn't catch the ear with their melodies or technical proficiency. For the most part they were also very lightweight and underwhelming. The drumming didn't help, it didn't make things any heavier or any more interesting. \n\nI heard that this album was a return to their old sound. It isn't. I heard its the new sound mixed with the old sound. This isn't quite true either, its more like the new albums with slight influences from the old albums, but nothing here hits the same intricacy of Downfall or savage breakneck speed of Hatebreeder. Nor do any of the openings carry the same weight and pump me up as much Everytime I Die's did. In fact this album is so forgettable and devoid of anything really that I could tell you more about what it isn't than what it is.\n\nAnd as an ending note, profanity in metal is overused, underwhelming and lacks any lyrical wit, so with lyrics like \"Shut the fuck up\" I'd like to say this album shows drops in quality in everything except vocals.\n",
        "\n\u201cI Worship Chaos\u201d offered me the unique opportunity to rediscover Children of Bodom. I adored Children of Bodom when I was sixteen, but then I, you know, learned to drive, finally touched a boob, and so on. I hadn\u2019t bothered listening to what Alexi Laiho and the Bodom boys were up to since they buckled beneath the sheer awfulness of \u201cAre you Dead Yet?\u201d and then somehow managed to drop the bar even lower on \u201cBlooddrunk,\u201d which was, for me, my last trip to the sauna. But things do change, and I reasoned little harm could come from retesting the waters of a band whose style of metal was really enticing and original back when it hadn\u2019t had its stupidity proudly tattooed on its forehead. I jumped into \u201cI Worship Chaos\u201d with a newfound \u2018tabula rasa,\u2019 a blank slate for Children of Bodom to load up with something wild.\n\nWell, they loaded it up with something, that\u2019s for sure. After listening to this a decent number of times, I bit the bullet and refaced \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d and \u201cAre you Dead Yet?\u201d to help me compare and contrast: \u201cI Worship Chaos\u201d is certainly the superior album in every regard next to those aforementioned dumps. It feels like a more comprehensive product from Children of Bodom, although calling it passable or even halfway decent is a wide stretch. \u201cI Worship Chaos,\u201d digging into the meat and potatoes here, conjures an incongruous glimpse of the bedlam Children of Bodom allegedly praises; it is an unadventurous, wishy-washy product from a band that should have access to numerous creative tools and approaches. Children of Bodom is essentially a Gordon Ramsay who refuses to cook anything but hot pockets.\n\nI\u2019ve found it difficult to pigeonhole Children of Bodom\u2019s sound, despite their using customs of this and knacks for that. This ends up giving \u201cI Worship Chaos\u201d room to feel out the depth of the group\u2019s artistic reach; it just so happens their ventures aren\u2019t worthwhile. The melodic death stomps of \u201cI Hurt\u201d and the title track are almost on another planet compared to the atmospheric undertones and careful arrangements of \u201cAll for Nothing\u201d and \u201cPrayer for the Afflicted.\u201d The former group shows Children of Bodom throwing a musical tantrum, stomping around simple, angst-ridden grooves and bits that sound juvenile and tedious; the latter excavates some meaningful songwriting sections, although they are far from perfect. A serious issue is the band\u2019s inability to write compelling riffs. \u201cWiddershins\u201d and \u201cSuicide Bomber\u201d have alluring keyboard measures and attractive shredding elements, but the foundation is soiled right off the bat by vapid guitar work which only manages to hook once in a blue moon.\n\nThe shred-happy soloing guitars and keyboards are what end up saving \u201cI Worship Chaos\u201d from total drought. It\u2019s quite a marvel to hear the tradeoffs and raucous leads thrown everywhere, but the fact that they eclipse a whole album of material speaks volumes of the low quality used seemingly just to facilitate instrumental acrobatics. Laiho\u2019s vocals are the factor that hammered in the nail to make this just a mild, harmless listen. The man sounds like complete and utter ass, my god. His growls or shrieks or whatever they are come off as strained and forced, not to mention he spits out F-bombs as though contractually obliged to shroud the album in the everlasting presence of his inner douche. Laiho\u2019s voice hovering over the Children of Bodom shenanigans sums up \u201cI Worship Chaos\u201d perfectly: Dull, underwhelming, and a trifle annoying.\n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom's third album brought a mixed bag to the table in its musicianship, performance, and songwriting. Though it offered a great deal of memorable riffs and melodies in almost every song, it also held its fair share of convoluted indecisiveness, especially on the latter half of the album, as well as what one might deduce as musical laziness.\n\nDon't get the wrong message; this album absolutely provided the listener with chilling moments. In fact, the most consistently positive musical theme on the release are the lead guitar catch phrases, which begin songs like \"Children of Decadence\" and \"Hate Me!\", where the opening guitar lines really helps the song become alive. Additionally, in the songs \"Mask of Sanity\" and \"Taste of My Scythe\", the lead guitar is instrumentally complimented by the use of synthesizers, often imitating dulcimers, to take the place of the guitars in order to add some well-needed and well-taken variety throughout the course of the album. Alongside the introductory drum pattern and second-interval keyboard pattern on \"Hate Me!\", the implementation of these various instrumental sources grants the entire album the sense of eeriness desired from this band's musical and lyrical style. Likewise, this is seen in the orchestration of the opening track \"Follow the Reaper\". The rhythm guitars also had their fair share of moments to open other songs: \"Follow the Reaper\", \"Bodom After Midnight\", \"Northern Comfort\", and \"Kissing the Shadows\". The creativity of the last one listed, however, is not quite to the same degree as the others. If there's one consistent plus to this album though, it is the track openings.\n\n\"Children of Decadence\" has to be the best song on the album, but unfortunately, that's only because what it managed to do right was everything that most of the rest of this album failed to do. It not only gripped its listeners with the first note, but it built upon the main musical themes it introduced in the beginning over the course of the rest of the song. Contrary to songs like \"Taste of My Scythe\" and \"Northern Comfort\", the songwriting template is explicitly laid out and each subsequent theme is revisited numerous times in a sequential fashion, but not so much as to become tedious or repetitive. Rather, each segment of the song complements the previous and the upcoming almost perfectly.\n\nIn contrast, \"Follow the Reaper\" bears stark difference to the songwriting structure seen in \"Children of Decadence\" and also exemplifies the indecisiveness of the rest of the album. This song may come in second place despite its unclear structure because it has a certain fluidity to it. While tracks 5-9 (with the exception of \"Hate Me!\") follow the same sort of relaxed, fluid pattern, the approach the band tries to make falls short because the segments either do not effectively bond to make a good song or are too convoluted and seem to be superficially and non-creatively complex just to fill time.\n\nThis leads to another issue with the album: lazy songwriting. Sometimes it's self-evident when a band just seems to be making up its guitar solos as it goes. Even in portions of \"Children of Decadence\" this can be seen, where the guitars are just mindless filler, but especially this is found true in \"Kissing the Shadows\", \"Mask of Sanity\", and \"Taste of My Scythe\", the first listed song having an over-glorified outro solo which ends the album on a very low note, to its own dismay. The primary exceptions to this rule are in \"Follow the Reaper\", where the rampant soloing actually has intent and purpose to itself, and in \"Everytime I Die\" which is the outlier to almost every conceivable theme in the album (which could be argued as a good thing). This song is the slow chugging piece whose bridge solo is reminiscent of some classic hard rock in its instilling of goosebumps. It's nothing spectacular, but it flips the bill.\n\nThe vocalist is competent, to say the least, but when he tries to turn his hard vocals into growling/singing, it becomes the closest thing you'll find to Finnish metalcore vocals.\n\nIn place of relying on discombobulated soloing and riffing, some of the melodies in songs like \"Mask of Sanity\" with its groovy guitars following the dulcimer intro, and \"Taste of My Scythe\" in its mainline soprano guitar, could have used some revisiting much to their improvement. As I mentioned before, every song had its awesome moments, but as a whole, this album's contents failed to relay those creative, innovative, and memorable elements to the whole 38 minutes.\n",
        "\nFor all their antics, the slow burn rock stardom and almost deliberate attempt to forget where musically they came from, a part of me will always hold onto the Hate Crew for helping cultivate my tastes into the more melodic side of extreme metal. That part is also able to take some of the finer bits of their more recent material and run with them despite them not being as up to snuff as the works that put them on the map in the first place and ignore the lesser-tier elements and songs (see: \"Blooddrunk\" and \"Halo of Blood\" being decent-to-very-good albums to partake in, whilst \"Relentless...\" is best left by the uninspired wayside). So it's with that mindset in play, as well as a touch of curiosity to see how well they could fare as a four piece for the first time in their existence, that I jump into an album that, to be perfectly frank, I've been honestly anticipating (if for no other reason than how well \"Halo...\" turned out to be)...\n\nAt this point in the band's existence, it would be best to take them for who/what they are these days as opposed to pining for the old days like past-living spinsters. It could be what's lead to all the throat-cutting in the face of their more recent output from many of you out there, but I could be wrong. All that aside, what we get with \"I Worship Chaos\" is, upon both initial and subsequent impressions, the most solid example of Bodom going straight melodeath we've gotten in recent years. At best, one may recall the sharper parts of \"Hate Crew Death Roll\" mixed with the simpler stop-start riffing of \"Are You Dead Yet?\", yet with a few more sips of espresso upping the ante and intensity. Despite the Children's capacity for angst and antagonism, this ended up being a somewhat fun listen that brings much to the table in terms of appreciation and acceptance (e.g. the bouncy, punk-meets-dance \"Hold Your Tongue\", for one...). The end result is still able to speak for itself, where the melodic sections, the twisting leads and a deeper sense of atmosphere via harmony, clean sections and keys over simply being heavy makes this a record I feel I could come back to time and again, 'cause dammit if I didn't really enjoy it (in varying degrees, of course...).\n\nThere's much more going on within the tracks than we've come to expect with CoB these days, and such a layered effect makes the lesser moments more accessible and the brighter ends memorable and grand, where the overall compositions sound like actual full-on ideas on how and what they are meant to be. Such creative honesty is quite hard to come by these days, and if you can take nothing else away from it, that should be plenty enough. As well, the lack of a second guitarist hasn't seemed to hurt the creative and quality ends of the album, and if nothing else the rhythms sound tighter and more honed than I recall hearing in the past couple works. While not a complete entity like they'd hoped to be with this, the foundation of the work is still plenty concrete and strong with regard to how it all came out in the end. It may not be the wild abandon extremities of old, but it's clearly also not drudging bro-core either. And I'm quite OK with that.\n\nIn the end, \"I Worship Chaos\" is an unexpectedly solid work that thankfully proves the band has the capacity to work within some of their older stomping grounds as they continue to maintain their mainstream status quo. Certainly nothing wrong with that, as they've definitely earned their stripes in spite of expectations and more than a few iffy musical decisions, and to that end I'm sure to return to this when the time and impulse is right. Recommended, and then some.\n",
        "\nTwo years after the strong return to form which was the diversified, inspired and original \u2018\u2018Halo of Blood\u2018\u2018, Finnish cult band Children of Bodom is back with nine brand new tunes and a few cover tracks on \u2018\u2018I Worship Chaos\u2018\u2018. This is the first album the band recorded as a quartet after the departure of guitarist Roope Latvala. His genius in form of memorable riffs and rhythms might be missing here and there but overall, \u2018\u2018I Worship Chaos\u2018\u2018 is a surprisingly solid release that sounds much better than what the previously released new songs and singles indicated. This record is a great example that the whole is sometimes greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe band included everything critics and fans from around the world like about them on this output. Fierce mid-tempo stompers like the cool opener \u2018\u2018I Hurt\u2018\u2018 meet sinister and fast-paced bangers like \u2018\u2018Horns\u2018\u2018. The first single \u2018\u2018Morrigan\u2018\u2018 works surprisingly well in the context of the record since it adds almost folk-influenced melodies to the potpourri and comes as a welcome melodic break between some of the hardest melodic death metal tunes the band has recorded over the past years. \u2018\u2018Widdershins\u2018\u2018 mixes both epic melodies and a horror movie atmosphere that could have been taken from an old school radio play and concludes the regular album version on a quite complete note. The greatest tune on the new album is probably the calmer \u2018\u2018All for Nothing\u2018\u2018 that convinces with a stunning duel between the guitar and the keyboard in the melodic middle part that goes back to the band\u2019s power metal style.\n\nWhile the folk-influenced \u2018\u2018Morrigan\u2018\u2018, the epic power metal half-ballad \u2018\u2018All for Nothing\u2018\u2018 and the atmospheric closer \u2018\u2018Widdershins\u2018\u2018 offer majestic keyboard passages and melodic guitar riffs and solos, the rest of the record features more sinister keyboard tones and brutal and tight extreme metal riffs. The two instruments clearly dominate this album and stand for all the typical band trademarks. The rhythm section consisting of bass guitar and drums is a little bit unspectacular at times and could have been a little bit more experimental, ferocious and present overall. The vocals are nothing technically stunning but they are charismatic, diversified and inspired enough to keep the tension high. Alexi Laiho growls, screams and whispers in many different ways that always complete the atmosphere of each single song.\n\nThe different limited editions rate this album up as usual. This time, the crazy Finnish quartet covers female-fronted American punk rock band Plasmatics, American country and soft rock artist Kenny Loggins, the Finnish folk metal band Amorphis and even British new wave pop band Bananarama on the Japanese edition of the album. These choices are once again very eclectic and fun to listen to. I was first skeptical about the Amorphis cover since they are my very favourite band but Children of Bodom\u2019s version of \u2018\u2019Black Winter Day\u2019\u2019 can be described as a successful attempt at mixing the unique magic of the original with their very own sound. The epic keyboard passages, the dragging and longing atmosphere and an inspired vocal performance make this song stand out among the other tunes since the original tracks is treated with a lot of dignity, passion and thought.\n\nWhile this release doesn\u2019t offer one particularly outstanding song, \u2018\u2019I Worship Chaos\u2019\u2019 is definitely one of the band's most consistent releases in terms of quality and quantity. Overall, I would place this album in the upper middle section of the band\u2019s extensive discography. If you liked \u2018\u2018Halo of Blood\u2018\u2018, which has grown a lot on me, you might realize that \u2018\u2018I Worship Chaos\u2018\u2018 doesn\u2019t beat its high-quality predecessor but turns out to be a truly respectable follow-up. On a final side note, the cover artwork of this record is really gorgeous and among the band\u2019s very best in my opinion which should encourage their fans to buy the vinyl version of this album.\n",
        "\nCoB has always been a weird band for me. I like the stuff that's meant to be bad (especially Blooddrunk) and don't really feel all the stuff that most Bodom fans seem to like (for example, Hate Crew Deathroll never really hooked me the way that it does with a lot of others). Much has been made of their post-2003 releases, although the previous release Halo of Blood was deemed a \"return to form\". Personally, that's not how I felt, although it sure as hell beat Relentless Reckless Forever. Their latest release falls way below that level, although at least it can be said that it's better than the abomination that was Relentless...\n\nIt does have to be said however, I Worship Chaos is very solid. There aren't really any moments on the album that are horrendously bad, unlike most Bodom albums. Generally I find at least one song that I can't help but skip, but here everything's okay. A few are a bit awkward, but nothing that really poses a major offence to the ears. Unfortunately there aren't as many highs as on other albums though, perhaps as a direct consequence of that. If posed with the question of whether I'd rather have ten decent songs or eight rubbish ones and two great songs, I think I would go with two great songs, which is one of the cons of this album. There are no real standouts, even if some songs are better than others. They're all just varying degrees of average.\n\nIt also has to be said that there are quite a few awkwardly constructed passages across the album. Listen to the start of 'Horns' (or most of it to be honest). What the hell is that? It's hard to really understand what's trying to be achieved there, even if the song sort of picks up by the middle. It just seems a little disjointed and uncoordinated. The start of 'I Hurt' is also a bit odd, and I find the keyboard and guitar don't really match. That's a recurring problem here, as it was on Halo of Blood (although to a lesser extent on that album). Janne's playing also seems slightly half-hearted for the most part, and he only really seems invigorated in the solo battle with Alexi at the end of 'All for Nothing'. The rest of his stuff is either barely noticeable for the more forceful guitars that pretty much bury the keys or just there simply because it's not Bodom without keys. That's what it sounds like anyway.\n\nAlexi's vocals are on par with most of the band's albums in the last ten years, which is to say that they're pretty poor compared to the awesome growls that you'd get with bands like Amon Amarth, but equally they're miles better than the dry and raspy hiss that Alexi used to offer on albums like Hatebreeder. He's far better with the axe, but it has to be said that there aren't really that many moments of brilliance here. There's something about the guitar's tone that isn't all that attractive, and on top of that there's a lot of very basic riffing. Nothing comes close to 'Bodom Blue Moon', or 'Trashed, Lost and Strungout' or even 'One Day You Will Cry'. It's all pretty uninspiring and dull. Once again, there is nothing spectacular about this album at all. At least on their so-called \"failures\" (post-Hate Crew basically) there were tracks that were fun and made you want to rock out. And that's where Bodom have failed here, because although there's not much to dislike about I Worship Chaos, there's not much to like either.\n",
        "\nWhereas 2013's Halo of Blood was a return to forms and a proper follow-up to sophomore Hatebreeder and third Follow the Reaper albums, it seemed the band was trying too hard. This can't be said of 2015's I Worship Chaos, where the band sounds both fresh and hard and pursues the same sound they were heading to at the beginning of the 2000s.\n\nFor the first time ever, Children of Bodom recorded as a 4-member band, meaning every single riff, lick and guitar solo is executed by Alexi Laiho. And, let me tell you, this seems to have changed the finish of the compositions, which sound sharper and contains multiple layers that fit once again, especially the solos.\n\nI Worship Chaos is probably the best album the band recorded since 2000's Follow the Reaper. Of course, Hate Crew Deathroll (2003) was a great album, but changed a lot the style of a band who made work the combination of styles such as melodic death, thrash and power. Now we find a little bit more of black metal (especially in the drumming and blast beats) and even glam / 80's hard rock added to the formula, especially in riffs from \"My Bodom (The Only One)\" or \"Widdershins\" tracks.\n\nKeyboard solos sounds crazier and maybe reminiscent of 2003's \"You're Better Off Dead\", winning back focus and covering once again the album as a whole in an atmosphere previously heard only in Follow the Reaper. Guitars have a lot more feeling while still showing Laiho's virtuosism. About the tracks, we get tour-de-force songs such \"My Bodom (The Only One)\" or the darker and neoclassic \"Horns\", catchy ones such as \"Morrigan\" or \"Hold Your Tongue\" and never before heard ones such as \"All for Nothing,\" Which is Bodom's most melancholic and different sounding song they've ever recorded. We finally get to hear guitar and keyboard talking to each other in a final part that fits more solos than any other Bodom song in the band's history. The other slow one, \"Prayer for the Afflicted\" is perhaps too reminiscent of the Bodom classic \"Angel's Don't Kill\", and yet works as, again, the solos sound inspired. \"Hold Your Tongue\" kicks with a modern In Flames influenced riff just to lead into a rock song catchy as hell. The Children of Bodom are back with a vengeance.\n",
        "\nOut for two days, and already we have a flood of premature, ludicrous reviews deeming I Worship Chaos an affable \"return to form\" for the band. Let me take you back to a time long forgotten, when the same laughable tune was sung for the pitiful Blooddrunk; a low point for the band and ill-fated attempt at going halfway back to the old sound, as it were. But what is this \"old sound,\" and what does that abstract descriptor actually imply? In 2015, sane minds would presume that the band's target should be somewhere around Hate Crew Deathroll, which retained a fair heaping of Follow the Reaper's over the top melodic temperament alongside heavier, more deliberate riffing that foreshadowed some of Are You Dead Yet? - which in itself has aged quite well as far as I am concerned. As much vitriol as Are You Dead Yet? received at the time of release, the material largely holds up, even if basked in a more agreeable light courtesy of the tragic misfires executed afterward. What would you say if I mentioned the prospect of an album that fused Blooddrunk's lack of melodic sense with Relentless Reckless Forever's irrelevance? Excited, right?\n\nI Worship Chaos is certainly a massive step down from the slightly-overrated Halo of Blood, which shocked a sizable contingent of fans into blindly supporting Children of Bodom yet again. This album is the snap back to reality that I suppose many of us had coming, so with that said, where to even start here? Featuring a parched, arid guitar sound that effectively hails back to Are You Dead Yet?, sonically the record is on point and a reasonable deviation from the previous two efforts, which sounded too cleaned up and toothless for my liking. The band squanders these advantages along with any fair-weather followers they may have picked up over the last two years by regressing past Blooddrunk and to a point that neatly organizes all of the band's absolute worst attributes and lays it all out to bare. Look no further than the title track, which is a mess of fucking heinous proportions, featuring an opening riff that not only goes on for far too long, but could be written by any bozo with a Lamb of God poster hanging on his wall. \"My Bodom (I Am the Only One)\" plods and stumbles like it has two left feet, trying desperately (and failing) to reach the average level of \"Was It Worth It?\"\n\nElsewhere, the band clearly struggles to find their collective identity after such a long time phoning it in. Through the music, you can almost hear Alexi, his mottled brain rotted from years of Jack Daniels and delirium tremens, stop and say \"Wait, which album am I trying to emulate here?\" This much is evident on faceless skip button-exercisers like \"Horns\" and \"Hold Your Tongue,\" which feel like they might have promise if the band put the time in to adequately develop the ideas. Instead we get (as stated nearly ten years ago in my review for Are You Dead Yet?) vehicles for solos. Merely a hodgepodge of average riffing sequences loosely tacked together and truncated to rush to the trade-off solos as soon as possible. So with that said, in a band lauded for high energy above all else, how could the idea of a song without solos of any sort, pass as a good idea? How could that even be considered!? Well, those of you pining for Children of Bodom sans any redeemable qualities will find your bastion in the title track. Execrable.\n\nWorth pointing out is the continuation of a trend reaching as far back as \"Downfall\" from Hatebreeder; that being the strength of the more atmospheric mid tempo tunes. Just like on Halo of Blood, I Worship Chaos has two tracks that fit the bill. \"Prayer for the Afflicted\" is the only true moment of glory here, existing as a competent successor in that typical \"Angels Don't Kill\" format. Brooding opening with string arrangements, and a more epic slant on the whole. It still works so well, it feels like it doesn't even deserve to be among the rest of the swill contaminating this cesspool of wasted potential. \"All for Nothing\" has some redeeming qualities with the understated pianos, but the riffs feel sewn together. It is like a flimsy caricature of \"Dead Man's Hand on You.\" Kudos for the extended solo exchange near the end, which contains nearly all of Janne's worthwhile moments. Dude needs to get his shit together, because the latest Warmen album was not only good for a laugh, it contained more guest performances than conscious effort from Janne himself. Here on I Worship Chaos we find him more aloof than ever, delivering yawn-inducing scale runs instead of the creative, emotive soloing that was present even on Relentless Reckless Forever. He hasn't taken this band as seriously as he should for ten years, simply collecting a paycheck to get drunk on stage.\n\nI honestly hoped that Latvala's departure would shock Laiho into some sort of desperate effort, but it appears that Roope's senior presence may have been the glue holding this sinking ship together. \"Morrigan\" has some stronger riffs despite an oddball overall sound, and \"Suicide Bomber\" features a keyboard/guitar tandem that sounds straight out of Follow the Reaper (you'll know it when you hear it), but that is really all Children of Bodom leave us with here. Fleeting glimpses of styles long past, existing here only by accident due to the band's desperation at piecing together enough material to pass as a full length amid obvious label pressure. No true passion has gone into I Worship Chaos, and unlike Are You Dead Yet? I promise you that nobody will be singing its praises ten years down the road. All for nothing.\n",
        "\nTo be quite honest, I'm rather baffled by the split in opinion over Children of Bodom's \"early\" and \"late\" work. I understand that for the most part, Are You Dead Yet? was a departure from the traditional power metal with fucking huge teeth sound that the band had developed, yet I'm not completely sure why Blooddrunk has been canned by so many people. It's a much purer release (we're talking classic metal here) than its predecessor and has more memorable songs, plus some great performances to boot. In my opinion, a big improvement.\n\nFirst up, hats off the the band for writing 'Hellhounds on My Trail'. It's a fucking enormous opening track that really thrashes like a bitch, it's got a great melody that is like a razor-sharp Stratovarius, the attitude is all there, and then there's that solo that really does have to be heard to be believed. Maybe I'm wrong to single out one track, but 'Hellhounds...' is an incredible start to the album and does a lot to reassure me about the direction of the music here. Naturally, the band didn't make a whole album full of such creations; the overall style still tends towards the more modern, slightly chuggy direction that the previous album started. There is, however, a more obvious sense of excitement going on here that is about more than just a recovery from the dull production of Are You Dead Yet? and fully extends into the songwriting skills that have been brought to the fore.\n\nFirstly, the power metal influence has come back strongly, with Janne Wirman's keys a noticeable presence on most of the better songs (he gets a few nice leads), as well as Alexi Laiho remembering how to write his inimitable melodies. The greater melodic range of the lead instruments makes songs like 'One Day You Will Cry' (which has some boring riffs) feel vital and unpredictable, especially when those instruments suddenly pop up in a structurally unexpected part of the song. There are generally more solos from Laiho, almost all of which are markedly more creative and crazy than his contributions to Are You Dead Yet? The rhythm players are doing their bit too, steering clear of the slower tempos at which they struggle and rarely descending into mindless shuddering or chugging.\n\nAs well as a return to power metal territories, there is a clear thrash influence on several tracks, such as the furious closer 'Roadkill Morning'. A couple of moments of absolutely stunning band unity shine through, such as the electric first minute of 'Tie My Rope', which seethes with pissed malevolent energy yet also manages to sound celebratory, and the time changes throughout the album are impeccable, so absolutely no complaints about Jaska Raatikainen on drums. The tone of the guitars is made thunderous by a really big bass sound that is ultra-modern, even when played in a more classic style, meaning that the aforementioned 'Tie My Rope' never has to choose between power metal and visceral metal power.\n\nI have had a lot of issues with Alexi Laiho's vocals on most of CoB's work, but his approach here actually works. He doesn't sound nearly so ragged as I've sometimes heard and the recklessly violent approach of the songs means that his lack of subtlety is less of a detriment than one might think. His lyrics are still really stupid (I don't think that will ever change) but the feel of his delivery is always rabid and crazy, which suits this set of songs better than any before, plus the slightly deeper guitar tone accords with that of his voice, so it's no longer like two razors slashing at your ears. It's almost certainly down to his intensity that Blooddrunk works, whether that be his vocals or the amazing solos that he throws down on every track. The slightly generic modern sound of the title track and 'Smile Pretty for the Devil' falls a bit flat, but everything else impresses with a torrent of riffing and lead work, except 'Banned from Heaven', which actually impresses for its subtlety and emotion, God forbid. There are 2 vaguely jokey bonus tracks on my edition that are both amusing and still kick ass as well. Honestly a triumph.\n",
        "\nWell what have we here? An intriguing little opus from a band I've ignored far too long? Yeah I haven't managed to start digging in Children Of Bodom's backyard until recently. It was a backyard that I was told had a really cool shed, but was filled with rabid dogs that had swoopy hair and daddy issues. Well fortunately, the entrance to that shed seems to be right near the front gate. Because I'll be honest, \"Something Wild\" was an album that I had ZERO expectations for, but came out pleasantly attached to.\n\nThis album has an almost Iron Maiden- esque sense of drama to it. But at the same time it has an almost adolescent, some would say \"child-like\" aura of rebellion. Initially, it was this rebellious, 16 year old aura that drove me away. And now it's a strange kind of draw. This album is really just kind of a balls out, no holds bar joy ride. But it's a skillful joy ride that ends in a jump off of a bridge in slow motion, right back to the driveway. I guess you could say that these guys are the W.A.S.P of extreme metal in a strange way. And I'm assuming that's an honor for these guys. As luck would have it, the wheels on this ride are the riffs. They really have no set standard of genre. While they are obviously mostly rooted in melodeath, I heard a HEALTHY amount of black metal on this album. More specifically on the song \"In The Shadows\", which after a quick bass interlude jumps into a pure black metal riff in the style of Emperor or Dissection. This album really is \"jumpy\" in that way. There are no simple transitions, it's like this album is perpetually on a diving board to the next riff. While most bands would make that jarring and uncomfortable, Children of Bodom give it an almost zany and crazy feel. This is due in no small part, to how much each instrument plays a part.\n\nWhile the riffs are by far the most important part of this album, the keyboards are certainly not satisfied to just sit in the corner and do crossword puzzles. Heck, the first track \"Deadnight Warrior\" is pretty well keyboard driven in itself for the verses at least. They have a snowy and glittery presence to them. And I think I should explain that as to avoid sounding 80 degrees of lame. The keyboards have a flaked sound to them, like they're falling from the ceiling in particles. They sound \"dusty\" if you will. And they compliment the absolutely beautiful guitar melodies. There is some serious skill in the guitar department of this album. It's like the rest of the instruments are running in a straight line, and the guitars and keyboard are weaving in and out of that line in skillful and fluid manners.\n\nEach song has a symphonic sound and structure. You could almost say that it's borderline neoclassical. But this album certainly does not waste time with wanking around, no sir. The structure and songwriting is absolutely superb...minus the vocals. Good lord poor Alexi. I genuinely feel bad for the guy, it's not that his vocals are particularly terrible, it's more how he kind of \"yowls\" them out. And this certainly doesn't get helped by the fact that nearly all of his lyrics are improvised. I mean this is some embarrassing writing here ladies and gentlemen. Just think of the worst thing you said when you were 13 years old and angsty. You probably wanted to forget that didn't you? Well too bad because Alexi has immortalized every uneducated and hormone dripping mistake you ever made into his lyrics. If this band wanted to go instrumental, I don't think anybody would have a big problem.\n\nThis album's coup de gras would lie in it's almost Victorian gothic atmosphere in some songs. More specifically in the song \"Red Light In My Eyes\". It's almost like the band was told to write a song that summed up the events of the Castlevania franchise. Everything is so web-covered and stone cold. The second part even interludes near the start with some wind tunnel toned organs before jumping into a frantic and speed picked melody. You could almost assume the band was wearing some frilly shirts and practicing poor hygiene to get in the mood. I guess you could say this is where people say the power metal rears it's head from, but I don't really know.\n\nI mean, I can certainly see where people are seeing the power metal angle from, but I can't say I totally agree. While this album does share some traits commonly seen in power metal, these don't strike me as power metal riffs. They lie more in the range of traditional heavy metal riffs with some neoclassical influence if you ask me, but maybe I'm the idiot here. Either way, the atmosphere is absolutely dripping with classic neo-gothic and Victorian texture. It hearkens back to that sense of Iron Maiden-like drama that I brought up at the beginning of the review. The band takes it time to build up and be as theatrical as possible. Like each song is a castle being built up in front of your very eyes. And as you're watching it be built, the more narrow and sharp it gets near the top. Much like the songs on this album build up to a strong and fitting point.\n\nWhile this album might have a flaw or two strewn throughout (Alexi's poor cat yowling and the somewhat unremarkable drums), I think it's a prime example of classic late 90s melodeath, with some theatrical and atmospheric structure.\n\nI think those who see melodic death metal as a bastardization and poor representation of what death metal is about should check this record out. You might very well be eating those words in your cereal while Alexi reminds you of how much you hate your parents.\n\nFinal rating: 9/10\n",
        "\nI was about 15 years old when a friend of mine told me to check this album out. He described it as a tasteful mix of Malmsteen-influenced guitar work, black, death and power metal. So basically my favorite guitar player at the time and three genres I had recently discovered and just begun getting into. Well, I could never thank that buddy of mine enough, because he got me into a band that has since been among the ones I love the most. A band that back then helped me a lot in taking the first steps into the more extreme areas of metal.\n\nNevertheless, I don't really consider either this record or Children of Bodom to be extreme. To be fair, I actually think quite the opposite: this one's truly a catchy, easy listening album. True, it has harsh vocals. True, it has pounding drums. True, the riffs are aggressive, violent and fast. But it's the way all those things blend together, the way everything is so skillfully played and put alongside remarkable neoclassical melodies, that makes the listening of Something Wild such a refreshing, delightful experience.\n\nSongwriting in this album follows pretty much the same formula for each of the songs, with significant variations being few and far in between. The basic elements of Children of Bodom's (by now) well established style are all there: a lot of solos and technically impressive guitar work, great drum fills and some melodic intermezzos masterfully created by keyboard virtuoso Janne \"Warman\". The amazing thing, however, is that it all manages to be interesting all record long, luckily failing to become dull, repetitive and boring. This relies in great part on the captivating and intriguing melodies, all extremely catchy, but on the album's duration as well, which is of about 35 minutes: long enough to feel like a proper full length, but short enough to keep it interesting. Another thing I retrospectively noted about this record, after having listened to other Children of Bodom releases, is that it features the most black metal-oriented songwriting of their entire discography. Of course not enough to consider it a black metal album, but the influence is pretty evident, especially in some of the tracks, like \"In the Shadows\", for instance. The first melody of the first riff of that song has always reminded me a little of Darkthrone's \"En Vind av Sorg\".\n\nI can't deny, however, that this record isn't perfect. Its production, for a start, I never really loved, even if it's not the worst I've ever heard. At times the guitars sound almost muddy. I definitely think that Children of Bodom benefits the most from a clean, polished and refined sound. I'll further add that Something Wild doesn't reach the majestical compositive peaks of Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper, which remain the real masterpieces of the band. But all this is quite understandable, when you realize how this record was written and recorded by a band where almost all of the members were minors, and all the more impressive considering that these kids even back then used to play like weathered professionals.\n\nAll in all I feel like recommending this record to just about anyone, but especially to those young metalheads still struggling to get acquainted with the more extreme fringes of metal, such as black and death metal. It might be enough to encourage them to make the final plunge!\n",
        "\nShould you listen to only one release from these Finnish metal oddballs, you would be well-advised to make it this one. Indeed, this live recording may very well encapsulate their work at its purest and at its best.\n\nFirst of all, the sound mix here is incredibly well balanced, giving all five instruments, bass included, a chance to breathe and to be easily picked up by the listener\u2019s ear. The recording is also very raw and authentic, with little to no post-production polishing such as overdubbing the sound to hide performance mistakes. Likewise, though the audience is very clearly audible, the kind of self-indulgent, artificially enhanced crowd noise present on too many a live album is nowhere to be found here. On the less bright side, a couple of the track-to-track transitions are absolutely jarring, making it clear that these particular songs were picked from different sets and did not originally follow each other. The rest of them, though, are fluid enough.\n\nAs far as the band\u2019s musical performance is concerned, it is top-notch. There seems to be very few mistakes, which is commendable considering that most of their songs are fairly difficult to play, at least on a popular music scale. The songs sound just as tight and well-crafted as they are in their studio incarnations, and in some cases even better as the band allow themselves to indulge in a few subtle tweaks. Alexi Laiho does a decent enough job with his harsh vocals as well, though his few attempts at actual singing (with a gruff, gravely voice) sound awkward and a little clumsy. Even so, said attempts are in no way grating or off-putting.\n\nThis recording is entirely made up of excerpts from their second album tour, so the whole selection of songs is from their first and second albums. This can be considered a good thing, as we are spared the ever so slightly sugary and plastic sounding aura that their later albums, though most of them are far from bad, would develop. As for the actual track list, most of the essentials up to that point are satisfyingly present. The only clear drawback here is the rather short total length of forty-five minutes.\n\nThe somewhat original front cover artwork is worth mentioning, as it is a colorful and pleasing parody of Japanese animation graphics. Admittedly, it starts looking really terrible if down-scaled too far, so the best way to judge it is to have a look at the real thing.\n\nOverall, this live album is an effort of better taste and considerably higher quality than the norm, and comes highly recommend especially to those whom live albums usually leave cold.\n",
        "\nComing to review a Children of Bodom album on Encyclopaedia Metallum - and particularly reviewing this album now, nearly 10 years on - feels rather like getting together with that girl/guy who's already slept with most of the town. You know that they've already experienced just about everything, they've been called all the names (Are You Dead Yet? has seen the whole scale, from terrific to terrible), and there might not be much else you can add. But, damnit, you're just too curious to pass up the opportunity. You just want to see what it's like. And to be quite honest, I really do think that it could be different with me. I haven't seen many reviews that speak anything near to what I think and my take on Bodom seems to wildly vary from many fans on this site.\n\nTwo things need to be said here. Firstly, I've never 100% got CoB, not in the sense that I don't find their music enjoyable or understand the reason for adopting their unique style, but because their songs are so full of rough edges to me that I've never been able to become really comfortable with the band. What I mean by this is that the fusion of neoclassical power metal and more extreme forms of metal (primarily melodeath, whatever all these guys shouting about black metal might think) is a fucking fantastic idea and has so much to offer, since it turns both subgenres completely on their heads; but - BUT BUT BUT - I can't find a good reason to let Alexi Laiho's crappy voice and crappy lyrics piss on the hyperspeed flow (at their best CoB flow) and shred-happy tendencies of such a phenomenolly capable band. How do I say this in another way? Would you let Robb Flynn sing a Megadeth song? That's what I thought. This band is all about finesse in the frenzy, but if Laiho insists on playing off the \"wild child\" image he's created and sounding like Johnny Rotten's death-crust little brother who's turned against himself, there isn't a lot of finesse going on in that department, and the frenzy is pretty childish too. Remember when CoB recorded 'Something Wild' without actually writing any lyrics? That's pretty much three quarters of every CoB album from where I stand. Okay, that's the bulk of my frustration done.\n\nThe second thing I need to own up to is that Are You Dead Yet? was my first CoB album. That's maybe for the best, because the first three albums were probably too chaotic for me to handle back then, but it also means that I didn't have any illusions about virtuouso playing or what \"pure\" Bodom was. There definitely seems to be less technicality on this album than the preceding ones, but I think that's partly down to a small shift in style and a few tweaks of the production. It's already been noted that the keyboards are less in evidence and there's a noticeable attack at modern metal - dare it be said, more commercial metal - with a gruffer, meatier guitar sound and a few groovier riffs. The best examples of this shift are 'Next in Line' which has those unthinkable bass plunges in a hugely dynamic groove riff that ends the song and 'Punch Me I Bleed' which stalls and chugs along like a terminally ill latter-day Helloween. In case it's not obvious, I rate the former but not the latter. 'If You Want Peace...Prepare for War' would also have stuck out like a dick at a picnic on previous albums, but it fits just fine here.\n\nThere is one benefit to all these changes. Bodom purists be damned, but sometimes the songs on Follow the Reaper could be just too busy and chaotic, which isn't quite the same as saying that they made me thrash like mad - more like they gave me motion sickness. The guitar tone on Are You Dead Yet?, as well as the bass tone that really gives it some ballast, files off one of the sharp edges of CoB's sound and just about provides room for Laiho's gnarly vocals to rip up my ears. Weighing up the slightly more restrained and less trebly riff set with the space in the mix where the keyboard flourishes used to be, the more conventional band sound actually gives focus back to song progression, which sometimes CoB have been guilty of neglecting. Thus, while not every song here is a killer and can't be dragged up so much by great solos, Are You Dead Yet? actually has the most memorable songs of Bodom's career in 'Living Dead Beat' and 'In Your Face', both of which feel like full-cream guitar tunes with a slight edge on previous numbers on the chorus front (they certainly both beat 'Hate Me!'). I reckon \"I don't give a flying, I don't give a flying, I don't give a flying fuck\" is also Laiho's answer to the question, \"How do you write your lyrics?\" but whatever.\n\nChildren of Bodom would have another crack at the same formula on Blooddrunk and fare marginally better at finding a middle ground between shredding and songs, but Are You Dead Yet? ends up being only a little less skilfully chaotic than any other Bodom album you could care to name.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom quickly developed a tag saying that they'd gone to shit after two albums that the public didn't respond to very well. You'd think then that they'd have picked up on the wake-up call that was sent out, but they really didn't with this release.\n\nFirst things first, I'd have been fine with another album along the lines of 'Blooddrunk'. Not so much 'Are You Dead Yet?', but I could at least deal with some of the songs on that record. This album doesn't go along either of those lines, instead resorting to a very toned-down, watery melodeath that really doesn't feel like much.\n\n'Not My Funeral' has some nice hooks going on in the chorus, but otherwise isn't up to much. The vocals are different to what they normally sound like, and actually the whole feel of the music is different too. The drums don't feel particularly strong, neither do either of the guitars. I'd like to say that this song is a one-off, but the whole album feels pretty much the same, from 'Shovel Knockout' (where you'd expect almost raw death metal) to 'Was It Worth It?' (which sounds a little washed up, and indeed is). The keyboard is good in places (for example 'Roundtrip to Hell and Back' where it practically drives the song), but a lone keyboard can't save an entire album when everything else is so far from the mark.\n\nThe title track is one of the many tracks that fall into the \"eh, it's okay\" category. It features decently heavy music (which is more than can be said for the majority of the album), better drumming than most places on the rest of the record (although it's still nothing to get excited about), alright keyboards and okay guitars. The music as a whole just isn't as great as I'd like it to be though. They're just lacking that little touch that says that Children of Bodom did it. Solos are okay, but nothing sensational.\n\nThe aforementioned 'Was It Worth It?' is also one of the songs that can be seen as okay, but that's all it can be seen as. The bits that are meant to be heavy aren't, the bits that are meant to be melodic aren't as melodic as you'd expect from CoB, and everything in-between is just a little poor. Surprisingly it does come together better than the individual parts suggest, but they're so poor that nothing can be done to turn it into a masterpiece.\n\nListening to this record just puts you in the mood to listen to something else, something heavier, faster and more epic. Maybe this album was actually released to make more people appreciate 'Blooddrunk' (I can practically hear the conspiracy theorists thinking it over now), but even if that's not what it was for that's the job it ends up doing. I might be going a bit overboard now, but this album makes me want to listen to some 'high-quality' Slipknot. Okay, that's maybe a bit far, but this album seriously sucks.\n\nTheir last album was described as \"an album of album fillers\" by Neloforster, but really I think that title belongs with this record. It's so poor in so many areas, and the best they can offer the fans are some okay songs. Thank god 'Halo of Blood' was a step in the right direction, because otherwise this band would have been a lost cause by now.\n",
        "\nTo say that Children of Bodom are bad would be a lie, and this album shows why they are a good band. But it would also be a lie to say that they were anything special. To be perfectly honest, as this review's title suggest, this is an unoffensive album of melodeath that is perfectly content at being nothing more than an average album. \n\nThis is a band I feel many kids, myself included, experience as a phase on their path to heavier music. And to this, I appreciate Children of Bodom's existence. However, if you've been in the metal scene for a while and just haven't gotten around to listening to this band yet, don't bother. Their entire discography is basically the In Flames record \"Reroute to Remain\". It's as close as melodeath can be to being accessible and that's it.\n\nBut, if I had to choose the best Children of Bodom album, it would have to probably be this one. The riffs are fast and somewhat memorable and it's also as close to being brutal as COB ever have gotten (which isn't very close but). The instrumentation beyond just the riffs here aren't the best, but they get the job done well enough. The songs are brisk and never feel like they drag on too long, although none of the songs have a feeling of true brilliance either so take that as you will.\n\nOn this album, Children of Bodom have almost become the Man O' War of melodic death metal, opting for fun over brutality. This isn't an entirely bad thing, as if the band had tried to be super serious, I feel the record would have seemed even sillier. Still, this will come down to personal opinion rather if this style is okay with you. Most of the songs here are about 4 minutes long, which adds to the accessible element of the album. There isn't anything here mindbogglingly complex, but the songs aren't so simple they become horrifyingly boring. However, the songs seem a bit more complex than they are, due to the great, mechanical production. Think of the production from Megadeth's Countdown to Extinction.\n\nBringing up Countdown to Extinction, I think that is a lovely comparison for this album, although I find that album to be vastly superior. Both represent a mix between their intended genre and a more accessible sound. Both albums have an extra sense of complexity, due to the fact that the production highlights every small detail. Also, the songs here are very concise, perhaps even too concise. In short, this is a good place to enter in the world of melodic death metal. It isn't so accessible that it feels like a pop record, or that it doesn't challenge new fans. That being said, any veterans should stay away, as this brings nothing new or better to the table.\n",
        "\nTo be perfectly honest, I don't know if I qualify to review this album as I'm not really into CoB's style of melodeath as much as many other bands. I mean, 'Blooddrunk' was my favourite album by them. I don't know about you reading this, but that makes me slightly nervous to review this album which was widely received as a return to form. But anyway, I bought this album and I am going to give my opinion on it.\n\nSo to start off with, we'll take the good things. One such thing is that Alexi's vocals are still pretty much the same as they were in 'Blooddrunk' (and I know that I bang on about his vocals not being great - which, let's face it, is true - but I'd rather they were like that than how they were on 'Hatebreeder'). Janne's keyboard skills are solid as per usual as well as Alexi's shredding skills. As a result of this there are some good songs, but there's something missing from the mix. What is it? Jaska's drumming. What do I mean by that? There are some good moments, but for the most part it feels pretty average, which isn't what I expect from someone as consistent as him.\n\nYou can quite clearly see the guitar skills coming through right from the riff on the opening track 'Waste of Skin' and they just continue on for pretty much the entire album. Roope's work is solid even if he doesn't get much of the limelight. Don't ask about Henkka's playing, because I can't make anything out besides the odd couple of seconds where nothing else is going on.\n\nSo is Jaska's drumming really so bad that I need to rate this album so lowly? No. The thing that's stopping me is that the style of music isn't for me. Yeah, I hear you booing. 'Your Days Are Numbered' is an excellent example of this, showcasing the type of music that I just can't get into. Something about the guitars isn't right about it. 'All Twisted' is another one of these songs that sound alright to begin with but quickly descend into something that I don't like. Almost sounds like pirate metal, which is a little bit unexpected to say the least.\n\nHowever, the positives do outweigh the negatives. There are a lot of decent songs, but there are only three songs I would say are really great on this album. 'Scream for Silence' is one, with the awesome hooks on the guitars that blend well with the keyboard. The drums are pretty sub-par on this track, but the rest of the band make up for it. Then there is 'Bodom Blue Moon', the only song I've heard that can rival 'Kissing the Shadows' in terms of technical expertise on the guitar. The final one is 'Transference', a slightly unusual song and not an area that I think I've heard Children of Bodom cover before. It's not as good as the other two, but it does give better impressions than most of the other songs do.\n\nOverall, it's not horrible. It beats 'Are You Dead Yet?' any day of the week. Having said that though, it's far from their best work and obviously even the better songs from this album aren't a match for the real classics ('Everytime I Die', 'Needled 24/7', etc). As previously stated, this isn't my taste in music and maybe the fans are picking up on something that I'm not.\n",
        "\nI'll be honest, while I do like a lot of stuff by Children of Bodom, I wouldn't describe myself as a fan. Why not? Because I only like the stuff that none of the 'real fans' like. Take 'Blooddrunk' for example. Most of CoB's followers dislike that album. A lot. I, on the other hand, think it's a masterpiece. So for an album where opinion seems to be pretty split, I kind of sit on the fence with this one.\n\nFirst off, the direction of the music isn't what they used to do back in the times of 'Hate Crew Deathroll' and 'Follow the Reaper', for the most part anyway. The one song people seem to come back to time and again when it comes to this album is 'Trashed, Lost And Strungout', for the obvious reason that it sounds more like old CoB than the rest of the tracks. Come on people, you're clutching at straws here. That song may be the best song on the album, but one song can't save what some people might refer to as a disaster.\n\nThe title track was what got me interested in Bodom in the first place, the interesting riffs on the guitars probably being the thing that caught my attention. However, looking back I have to say that it's far from the best song on this album. It's not the worst either, but it doesn't have much on the two songs I think of as the best.\n\nThose two songs would be 'If You Want Peace... Prepare For War' and 'Trashed, Lost And Strungout'. Strangely enough, I first discovered the former on Guitar Hero but it wasn't really to my taste in music back then. As a twelve-year-old it's the kind of thing that just seems too loud and heavy, but now it's just an awesome song you can't help liking. The guitar riffs are heavy, the drums solid and fast, the bass pretty sweet (and in this song you can actually hear it in places) and of course the keyboard creates interesting effects. Not to mention that the solo battle is one of the best I've heard. 'Trashed, Lost And Strungout' though just takes epic to a whole new levels for reasons that can't be described. In places it does sound a little reminiscent of Dragonforce, but for the most part it's a solid song that is extremely melodic for the most part.\n\nApart from these three songs, the album is pretty poor though. A couple of tracks started out well and I thought I was in for a treat, but as seems to happen so often they sold themselves short. The fact that there are only nine songs on this album (a total of a mere thirty-seven minutes listening time) is a little disappointing, but the general quality of the songs on the record kind of turn this into a blessing rather than a curse. Half the time I wonder what's meant to be going on in the song (most of all in 'Bastards of Bodom' - I mean, what even is that?) because I can't work out whether the song was meant to sound the way it did and if anyone listened to it first to check it didn't sound exactly the way it does. Not to mention that some of the songs sound nearly identical (have you compared 'Bastards of Bodom' to 'We're Not Gonna Fall'? I jumped from one to the next and could barely tell the difference).\n\nPretty much what I'm saying is that giving it a rating of 50% is quite generous, and that's almost solely because of how good two of the tracks on the album are. It's no wonder people think this is one of their poorer albums when two thirds of it is utter shit.\n",
        "\nI completely understand where all of the hardcore Bodom fans are coming from when they say that this isn't why they like the band. To say the least, this album is quite different from their other releases. But to describe it as Neloforster did and say it is 'an album of album fillers' might be a tad severe. In all honesty, 'Blooddrunk' is my favourite COB album, probably because it was the first one I listened to in full. Initially I thought something along the lines of \"What the fuck is this shit?\" when I heard it. Eventually though it did grow on me, and now it's one of my favourite complete metal albums.\n\nBasically, the song that everyone thought was a return to form for the band ('Hellhounds on My Trail') was the only track that I didn't like (discounting the bonus tracks, two of which I didn't like). Everything else was absolutely great, full of some of the heaviest riffs I've heard and epic shredding as well as duels between Alexi's guitar and Janne's keyboard. The drums are spectacular throughout the album - something that not all bands can boast about - thanks to the immense talent that is Jaska Raatikainen. Roope's playing is solid if nothing else, although he pales in comparison to Alexi (who I'm convinced must have sold his soul to the devil to gain his guitar skills). Bassist Henkka Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4's work isn't heard to often, but when it is you can hear what an excellent player he is. Alexi's vocals are the only thing that could be much better, but they fit in with the music and it's hard to imagine anyone else doing them.\n\nThe music itself is, while mostly along the lines of heavy and fast songs, features a nice variety in how it is delivered. There are the likes of 'Banned from Heaven' which is delivered in a far slower way than the other songs and 'Roadkill Morning' at the opposite end of the spectrum. Then there is the title track that features a more keyboard orientated approach than the other songs, although Janne's work is prominent in all the songs on the album. As per usual every single song features an Alexi Laiho solo (and generally one by Janne as well), but they do sound quite similar to each other. I don't know why they do, but that makes it hard to get excited about them. Still, at least the rest of the music makes up for it.\n\nStand out moments? The drumming on 'Lobodomy' is certainly up there, as well as the brutal tracks 'One Day You Will Cry' and 'Tie My Rope' (although I have to say it's mostly the guitars at the end that I love about the latter). If I absolutely had to pick though, I think I would say 'Tie My Rope' is my favourite track on the album. Having said that though, the entire album is absolutely amazing.\n\nThe bonus tracks that are available with some versions of the album aren't really anything spectacular. They're all just covers of other songs, and they're all available on 'Skeletons in the Closet' if you really want to listen to them (and countless other cover songs). Indeed, Children Of Bodom do manage to improve the songs (or two of them anyway) and make them heavier, but they weren't really anything amazing. The only one of them I enjoyed was the cover of Iron Maiden's 'Aces High', although that might be because I've never been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival or Johnny Cash.\n\nAnyway, overall the main album was great and remains one of the only albums I can listen to from start to finish (as long as you start from the second song). Maybe it's not the same stuff as the Hatecrew are used to, but it's a style of music that I like listening to. Maybe they'll make some more stuff like this in future, but judging from the other reviews that would be bad for business so I wouldn't say it was likely.\n",
        "\nI started listening to metal when I was about 14 years old. A friend of mine sent me some Bullet For My Valentine songs, which I instantly liked. I thought that was 'true metal'. Oh to be young and naive! That's 8 years ago, and since then my knowledge of the genre has expanded, and it still is. Although I must admit, I like listening to The Poison now and then. Anyhow, I was 14, I had listened to BfmV and all of the sudden someone sent me a song by Children of Bodom. That song was 'Are You Dead Yet?'. I was instantly blown away by the power and intensity of that song. That was my first encounter with CoB and the more extreme side of metal. I started listening to more CoB and the first album I bought was 'Are You Dead Yet?'.\n\nI'm a huge Bodom fan, I own all their albums, except for RRF, because that's the only one that I think that isn't good. My personal favourites are Hatebreeder, Follow the Reaper and the most recent one; Halo of Blood. I do realize that Are You Dead Yet? sounds completely different: it sounds too simple and has less neoclassical influences for which CoB originally was famous and praised for. But being the first metal album I ever bought, and the title track being the first 'real' metal song I've ever listened to, I love this album and I always will. I'm not a musician, so I can't really talk about all the technical stuff and so on, I'll give you my review based on how I experience this album as a listener. Nor am I a writer, I'll do my best making this a most enjoyable review to read, but don't expect me to go Tolkienstyle, or who ever you prefer. Let's begin!\n\nThis album is filled with riffs, it's true that they are simple, but that isn't a bad thing. They're powerful, catchy, aggressive and they get my head banging. Maybe Alexi was being lazy when he wrote them, maybe they were selling out and trying to reach American fans while betraying their own hardcore fans who liked Follow the Reaper. But because this was the first Bodom album I've ever heard, I could not see it that way. I liked the simplicity of the riffs! And when I heard Follow the Reaper or Hatebreeder, I thought: wow, this is even better!\n\nThe solos match perfectly in the songs. Next in Line, If You Want Peace, Prepare for War and We're Not Gonna Fall are the stand outs. Wirman's keyboard is more absent than in other albums, but when he does play a solo, it's impressive as always, especially when competing against Alexi. His absence during the riffs did not bother me that much, although it can create a more impressive sound, if you've listened to the other albums. But as I just mentioned, that was set straight during the solos on this album.\n\nThe bass and drums do in fact sound too simple. As I listened again and again to this album and compared it with the others, I expected more from Henkka's bass and especially from Jaska. He has some cool fills, but overall his performance is average. He's not the best drummer out there, but he's got skills. Listen to Halo of Blood and afterwards Are You Dead Yet? and you'll notice a great difference. However, it still works on this album, but it could have worked better. That's just the only bit of criticism I have.\n\nThe lyrics are cheesy and especially on this album they come with a 'I'm a bad boy'-attitude, but let's face the facts here: one does not listen to Children of Bodom because of the lyrics. The lyrics weren't, aren't and will never be the highlight of CoB. I just listen to them and sing along without thinking too much about them. That works for me, because on concerts I shout along like a 14 year old boy that I don't give a flying fuck, motherfucker.\n\nFor many fans, this album is blasphemous, and I can see why, but for me it was my introduction to this wonderful world of metal music. I listen to a strong variety of artists now, from Iron Maiden to Aborted, from Dream Theater to Parkway Drive. That is, next to musical aspects, also a big reason why I like this album so much. For the same reasons I like A Sense of Purpose of In Flames, or Soilwork's Stabbing the Drama. I'm aware of their earlier works and I also prefer them over their recent albums, but I still like those albums mentioned above. So if you have an open mind, you would really want to check this album out.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom have never been mind-blowing. They have always lacked depth and musical maturity. Everything enjoyable has always been so on a superficial level. And lyrically \u2013 well, it is downright embarrassing at times. Children of Bodom\u2019s albums are the empty calories of metal \u2013 at first they taste good, but in the end they do nothing for you and sometimes leave you with an aching stomach. That being said, Bodom\u2019s strongest album is without a doubt their 2000 release Follow the Reaper. \n\nFollow the Reaper is solid melodic death metal. It takes influences from power metal and from thrash metal and combines them into a furious beast. It is fun \u2013 but it lacks real depth. At first listen a track like 'Everytime I Die' sounds great: it has head banging chugged riffs, and a squealing guitar solo that inspires you to whip out your meanest air guitar. But as you listen to it again you realize those chugged riffs sounds like a high school kid playing with his brand new distortion pedal, you realize the main melody could have come from a forgettable game of the NES era. It can be catchy, but almost in that annoying way that top 40 pop songs are. \n\nThroughout this album the keyboards are almost as overdone as the pinch harmonics on the guitar. They are also pretty much ubiquitous throughout the whole album. Once you notice them, you can\u2019t un-notice them. The vocals get the job done, but aren\u2019t spectacular \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t help that the lyrics are completely juvenile. Even still, Follow the Reaper is not the worst lyrical offender of Bodom\u2019s albums (I\u2019m looking at you Are You Dead Yet?). That being said the bass tone and drumming is pretty top notch throughout the whole album. The production is also quite good \u2013 almost too good. \n\nThe composition of the songs is also unremarkable \u2013 often falling into the standard verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure. When Bodom deviates from this formula it is usually in the form of pointless interludes or keyboard sections that sometimes breakdown into some boring guitar chugging.\n\nIt sounds like I must hate this album, but I really don\u2019t. There are some great riffs and memorable songs. The strongest point on the album is probably the opening track \u2018Follow the Reaper\u2019 (if you can ignore the pointless spoken word intro). The intro riff is great and the transition into the first verse is enjoyable. It is full of fun keyboards and speedy guitar riffs. Unfortunately, the whole album is not on par with this song. Other highlights include \u2018Children of Decadence,\u2019 and \u2018Kissing the Shadows.\u2019 These songs are fun and make this album enjoyable. The other songs are just filler among a genre inundated with bands that shit out filler tracks. \n\nThe best thing to do with this and other Bodom albums is to take the best stuff and forget about the rest. There are many other bands out there that do what Bodom does, but better. Bodom is a gateway band into metal, once you are through the door, don\u2019t loiter, move on to the good stuff.\n",
        "\nFinnish melodic death metal band Children Of Bodom is, without a doubt, one of the most controversial and famous metal bands around the globe. Many people claim that the band keeps releasing the same record all the time, with only minor changes between each release. This is definitely true, but at the same time the band has developed a signature sound with heavy riffs, melodic guitar solos, stunning keyboard sounds, rebellious lyrics, and the dirty vocals of Alexi Laiho. I often hear people say that the band\u2019s last great record was \u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d, now more than ten years distant. Personally, I also liked the controversial \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d quite a lot, but must admit that the last two studio releases \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d and \u201cRelentless Reckless Forever\u201d were only of an average quality. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the band\u2019s greatest hits release that came out one year prior to this release, entitled \u201cHoliday at Lake Bodom\u201d. It included the amazing new covers of Dropkick Murphy's classic \u201cI\u2019m Shipping Up To Boston\u201d and especially Rick Springfield's jealous stalker anthem \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d. Usually, I\u2019m not at all into greatest hits releases as they lack atmosphere, coherence and tend to warm up old things but in this case it was different as all essential Children Of Bodom songs were finally united on one well filled record. When I read several positive reviews of the new \u201cHalo of Blood\u201d, I noticed a lot of people saying that this album was the band\u2019s greatest record in at least ten years. I figured there was hope for me, and I immediately tried out the new release.\n\nThe first single, \u201cTransference\u201d, immediately appealed to me. The great duels between guitar and keyboard go back to the band\u2019s roots, and sound much more joyful and unchained than the darker and heavier records that the band has released in recent years, despite the dark lyrics and the creepy video clip.\n\nDespite my positive first impression, after giving the entire new effort two spins I felt a little bit disappointed. It\u2019s a little hard to describe, but it feels like the band basically did another \"safe\" record with their typical trademarks, and rarely offers anything courageous or outstanding. Let\u2019s take the opener \u201cWaste of Skin\u201d as a perfect example. The song is energizing and fast, offers solid riffs and a great guitar solo, some dominant keyboard passages, and powerful vocals. This sounds positive, but the whole thing sounds directionless, has no truly catchy passages, and feels like almost any other song from the band\u2019s early years. It\u2019s definitely not a bad track, but I miss the certain something that makes it stay on my mind. From that point of view, I really preferred a more developed and modern opener like \u201cLiving Dead Beat\u201d... nine years ago \u2013 I think I\u2019m getting old! Many tracks are exchangeable and have exactly the same problem on here, or are even less interesting than the opener.\n\nThe two songs that really stand out on this release are \u201cScream for Silence\u201d and \u201cDead Man\u2019s Hands On You\u201d. The first track has a very melancholic melody that I would describe as very identifiably Finnish. The beautiful instrumental work of this mid tempo track reminds me a lot of other Finnish bands like Eternal Tears Of Sorrow or even the great Amorphis. The only difference is the vocal work of Laiho. While this kind of song sounds a little bit unusual from Children Of Bodom, I feel positive about this experiment and the song shows a lot of potential. I wish the band would have done more tracks of this quality, and hope for it on their future releases. \u201cDead Man\u2019s Hands on You\u201d is one of the most unusual, and perhaps one of the best tracks that the band has ever written. It\u2019s a slow and atmospheric half-ballad with great keyboard work and dark spoken word passages. The song keeps on developing, and offers a very diversified and passionate vocal performance which instills a very melancholic atmosphere. The longest song on this release has a truly majestic feeling, and is filled with enough creative ideas to remain intriguing until the end.\n\nOf course, one also gets some of the band\u2019s famous cover songs on the limited edition version of this release. I was really pleased to hear that the band picked \u201cCrazy Nights\u201d by the legendary Japanese heavy metal institution Loudness which I like a lot. Even though Alexi Laiho\u2019s vocals sound very limited in comparison to the original, the band has well-\u201cBodomized\u201d the song, and it\u2019s definitely the catchiest track on the entire release. The band simply knows how to pick great songs to cover. The other bonus song is a Roxette cover - \u201cSleeping in My Car\u201d, which is a rather unusual track, and that\u2019s exactly why it's so interesting to listen to.\n\nIn the end, the question you have to ask yourself is as follows: Are one good single, two truly creative and impressive tracks, and two cool cover songs enough to purchase an entire album at full price? This record is surely a step in the right direction, and better than the last two albums, but still not on the same level as the group's early material. Die-hard fans will surely get their hands on this record anyway, but more casual fans will be more likely to buy this album at a reduced price sometime around Christmas. Personally, I might just wait for another high quality greatest hits record to come around in another thirteen years or so, and would advise listeners to simply keep their precious money and just be patient.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\nThis is at least as good as Follow the Reaper. Revisionists like giving Hate Crew Deathroll a hard time by virtue of the fact that it portends the modern defects that began seeping into Children of Bodom's formula around this point in time. While there is undoubtedly a heavier, more deliberate inclination to the guitar progressions here, the band hasn't forsaken their melodious slant. This results in an aural amalgam that remains potent even when Hate Crew Deathroll is judged against its elder siblings.\n\nThere are a couple of instant classics here. \"Bodom Beach Terror\" begins as a largely mid-paced affair, but the powerchord-driven chorus is just ace. Wirman's twinkling keyboards counterpoint the riffs effectively, but once the lead comes in it rises to greatness. \"Angels Don't Kill\" is the obligatory slower number, and as usual the atmosphere is at its most potent here. Children of Bodom always pull the slower songs off most convincingly, regardless of their high-energy reputation. \"Triple Corpse Hammerblow\" turns heads immediately with an atmospheric intro, but also ends up featuring a great chorus riff and a melting pot of leadwork during its second half. \"Sixpounder\" ends up being perhaps the most interesting cut from a modern standpoint, as it serves as a stylistic precursor to the band's later, oft-abhorred material. Regardless, being the first it is also one of the best, as it manages to keep its head above water even with limited contributions from Wirman; the groove is just monolithic.\n\nI have to make special mention of the keyboards, as Wirman delivers nearly all of his most impressive solos here on Hate Crew Deathroll. The solo that closes out \"Bodom Beach Terror\" is by far the best one, followed closely by \"Chokehold (Cocked 'n' Loaded)\" and \"Lil' Bloodred Ridin' Hood\". The latter would be a forgettable track if not for the keyboard solo alone, they are really that good. The rest of his performance mainly manifests itself as twinkling bells and throbbing string sections. The performance falls in line with Follow the Reaper more than any of the band's other albums, and I suspect most fans wouldn't have a problem with this.\n\nHate Crew Deathroll sounds adequately massive, blowing the band's previous two albums out of the water in sheer production value. I still prefer Are You Dead Yet?'s guitar sound to this, but it lends itself to the proceedings quite convincingly. The drums sound snappy and potent as per Raatikainen's performance, but the heavier inclusion of Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4's clangy bass is a stylistic choice that only seems evident on this album.\n\nIt isn't perfect, as the opener \"Needled 24/7\" and the title track never did much for these ears. They are ripe with leads, but most if it doesn't stick, unlike most of the material here on Hate Crew Deathroll. Laiho's lyrics are trash, and he is his generally abrasive self here. It becomes something of an afterthought once you factor in the vivacity of the rest of the band, however. Most people seem to skip over this one, assuming it is similar in function and form to Are You Dead Yet?. They couldn't be more wrong.\n",
        "\nReleased to little fanfare, just like Relentless Reckless Forever before it, Children of Bodom's latest opus has once again resulted in a massive paradigm shift in the public opinion of the band, only this time to their benefit. I still can't help but feel like these guys are continuing this on-and-off pattern of going halfway back to their early sound in an attempt to win back their original fan base, only it really seemed to work here. Just like Blooddrunk before it, Halo of Blood attempts to hearken back to the group's earlier sound, only this time more convincingly and enthusiastically. While still a far cry from even Hate Crew Deathroll, the material here is definitely a step in the right direction.\n\nTo go positive first, Halo of Blood features two mid-paced, atmospheric romps in both \"Scream for Silence\" and \"Dead Man\u2019s Hand on You\". The band is at its best during these slower tracks, and on each of their previous albums (save for maybe Are You Dead Yet?) the mid-paced numbers were always the most convincing and as a rule showcased the band's melodious edge at it's finest. Quite ironic for a band lauded for their high energy above all else. Alexi is also vocally more tolerable and less monotonous here. He shifts into a half growl-half shout during some passages, and his inflection is less intelligible than on the last few albums, so another move in the right direction.\n\nWhat is really missing here for the most part are the triumphant melodies that were present on albums even as recent as Are You Dead Yet?. You can hear the band trying to replicate past glories as far as phrasing and playing style are concerned, but just like the past two albums, the melodies often start strong yet never fulfill their melodic potential. I understand that the band is going for a darker atmosphere here, and an easy way to do that is to inject a dissonant edge to the proceedings. The prime issue with that approach is that it guts what is perhaps Children of Bodom's greatest asset: the catchiness. Some tracks, such as \"All Twisted\" and the title track can get away with it due to a superior riff set, but it renders most tracks not already mentioned forgettable.\n\nThe lack of keyboards is again a concern. Wirman is again going for the atmospheric approach for the most part, and he ends up shadowing his performance on Hate Crew Deathroll minus the keyboard solos. Even the last album had one killer keyboard solo on \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\", a card that Halo of Blood sadly doesn't have in its deck as they are all forgettable scale runs. There are sporadic keyboard leads, but they are almost always harmonized or doubled-up with the lead guitar, rarely taking center stage. While Raatikainen at least delivers a fairly interesting performance on the kit, Latvala continues to do nothing interesting, as the album could have really used a second mind to spark variation in the guitars.\n\nThe band also sacrificed a lot of their recent heaviness on a more natural sounding mix. The guitars have never been more buried, especially the rhythm section. The leads will make this album a keeper to most listeners, but I for one miss the crushing groove of tracks such as \"Sixpounder\" and \"Living Dead Beat\" here on Halo of Blood. It isn't a deal-breaker, however, as this is still a good listen with at least four or five tracks that can hang with anything the band has released in the past decade. Keep it going guys, you are halfway there.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s get something straight: I am a diehard Bodom fan. I love their work, and even though I mocked Blooddrunk for obvious reasons (it\u2019s just a bad record), I still listen to it, and so I thought \u201chey, there is probably not a single COB record that I won\u2019t listen!\u201d. That was until Something Wild. You see; I happen to have their complete discography, and I decided to listen to it in reverse (starting with the almighty Halo of Blood to the \u201callshitty\u201d Something Wild) just because. I blazed through them, and when I finished listening to Hatebreeder I thought things couldn\u2019t get better. I saw reviews about people commenting on how good the album was and how amazing Something Wild was. I had never listened to a single tune of that album, and quite honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not gonna go over the first song, and then comment on the last, and the best one, the worst one; no. I\u2019m gonna do a straight-forward review highlighting why this album is bad because it shouldn\u2019t be! If you know me, you know that I tend to declare some bands (like Wintersun for example) as \u201cGreat musicians crafting bad music\u201d. This little catchphrase of mine fits perfect within this record profile. Not a single of these boys are bad performers; they are just\u2026 making shit up as they go! No, I am not gonna comment on how the lyrics are terrible, because, even though they are, it\u2019s not on the booklet, and I feel that the music is more than lyrics; it is the technical aspects, and oh boy, we have some technical difficulties. Getting back to that \u201cGreat musicians/bad music\u201d, this album feels like one of those tech-death's, a The Faceless-esque thing. What I mean is that all of these seven songs feel that they don't have a structure. None.\n\nRemember when I said that these Finnish lads were making shit up as they go? (Was that like what, 2 minutes ago? Jesus, I\u2019m only on the third paragraph?). Yeah, they did. The only songs I remembered after the first listen was \u201cTouch Like Angel of Death\u201d because it had a laughable chorus and \u201cRed Light In My Eyes Part 1\u201d because it had a good chorus. This is the album in a nutshell: Oh, that part was good, oh that part was terrible, yeah but that one other segment was kinda cool, whoa that intro is just kickass, yeah but that outro sucked hard. It\u2019s just a constant battle in my head I almost fell asleep at \u201cRed Light In My Eyes part 2\u201d.\n\nThe million-dollar question is: how can I review an album that never repeats itself, albeit some parts and segments? That\u2019s tough, but I\u2019ll do it.\n\nFrom a production standpoint, it is quite amazing, although this might be because I own a re-mastered version that enhances the sound quality. I can clearly hear every instrument of the record. The guitars, while imaginative, are not as good as I thought they would be. They are good, yes, but they never shine as they do in later releases. Alexi does solos whenever he wants (again, no structure), and I felt lost. It\u2019s like going to see your friend\u2019s band, and the guitarist just do whatever the fuck he wants. Again, it is no bad, just out of nowhere. Speaking of places that don\u2019t exist; where the fuck is the keyboard? Janne certainly plays the keyboards, and there are some moments that he appears, and he knocks it out of the park. So why doesn\u2019t he show up more? He is clearly the most talented member of the band. Just a missed opportunity. The drums are okay; Jaska is as good as he always is, he is very technical and very precise. Also, Henkka does a great job even though he appears not to have much material to work with, and feels like a step behind. That is a step behind. What I feel is a marathon behind is Alexi\u2019s vocals. Now Alexi has never been the best voice out there. In fact, I believe that his vocals are the cause of most of Bodom\u2019s mistakes. If they had someone over the mic that wasn\u2019t him, and let him stick with guitar-playing, would be a step up. Because man, why does he suck so hard on this record? The dude couldn\u2019t give a shit about anything else. Alexi opens his mouth whenever he wants, spills some bullshit lyrics, and sometimes he just talks with no rhyme or reason. There is no logic. There is no sense. Yeah, that\u2019s a good way to define it: No logic, no sense.\n\nSure, it\u2019s an amazing riff after an amazing riff, but what\u2019s the point if the listener doesn\u2019t remember shit about it? The band feels as they are playing a game titled \u201cwho can play better?\u201d and Instead of focusing in \u201cless is more\u201d they did that philosophy in reverse. If there is Something Wild about this record, is the fact that is literally wild. Each one of these songs is an untamed tiger doing what the fuck he wants. Why? Because he is stronger and more agile, he is more brute, he is orange. What? Jesus, this review has been going for far too long; I am comparing Bodom songs to felines... let's just get this over with and conclude the review.\n\nWill I recommend this? *sighs* well if you are a fan of technical stuff then check this out because there is some incredible stuff to be found here, but if you like some sweet and heavy melodeath, I suggest staying with the later records. I\u2019ll leave with this poetic phrase written by Laiho:\n\n\u201cWhat, you are the priest's son? So fuck -\nSO FUCK YOURSELF AND DIE!\u201d\n-In The Shadows\n\nThis review was originally written for my blog at http://www.darkwaveunderneath.com\n",
        "\nI've been a fan of the band's music for years now, but not so much their lyrical concepts. I'd say that aside from that, the music on this album really has turned into one of my favorites from the band. Just everything was to me so complete on here and another one you can listen to repeatedly and never get tired of. Each hearing you notice different things that you didn't hear previously. I think that a lot of people were expecting a little too much in the melodic death genre. This one is a combination of melodic death/power metal. If you get the newer version of it, there is a cover song by them of a Slayer tune from South of Heaven entitled \"Silent Scream.\"\n\nA lot of influences heard on here, but yet, doesn't every band have their influences? A 5-piece here spewing out a mixture of symphonic melodic death metal with power metal tendencies. The synthesizers didn't out weigh the music. In fact, I thought when rhythm nation came up far lacking innovative riff-writing, they incorporated the awesome atmosphere augmenting those not so amazing guitar licks. Definitely a better mixing than prior releases not to mention the production quality. I think that this way didn't get the higher credit that it deserved. I suppose that the sort of change in style here ousted fans making it harder to appreciate an experimenting band they've become.\n\nActually, I was quite impressed with every song because they all seemed to be well orchestrated and amazingly thought out. The guitars are in heavy crunch tone with lower tuning to make the songs especially \"Sixpounder\" more brutal with Alexi doing his job with his screaming alongside backup vocals. Where songs that seemed to fail, those synthesizers augmented the music seeming to come in there quite diligently. The solos were mad wicked as was in past work achievements. Even the synthesizers made it way more melodic and right on cue with the guitars. There were actual songs that began with them and were consistently in the background even during the vocals.\n\nThe band mainly in the guitar department really delivered making the music more tolerable not to mention downright thick! Alexi's solos shined in every respect and yet are still amazing compared to past works. They simply dominate, showing true talent from his techniques as well as diversity. The music is what is most captivating here. Everything that you hear here blows away past and future albums, way impressive sounds that go alongside the vocals here, not extraordinary tempo changes, just everything seemed to take on a heavier sound mixed with those melodic synthesizers.\n\nThis album does deserve a higher rating from what I've seen. Again, fans are lacking in the total appreciation in the creativity that was put forth on this album. In my view, I think it's their best album. The main reason is not only production quality, but the vocals, the guitars and the synthesizers were a total abomination to the eardrums. Give this band credit for putting out some terrific music from start to finish. They really took those 2 genres and made them blend in nicely musically speaking. The aggression is still there and the creations dived forth in a new creation. Make sure to YouTube \"Sixpounder\" and you'll hear one of my favorite Children of Bodom songs ever!\n",
        "\nI really like Children Of Bodom. I don't really like this album. I got into them at the time of Hate Crew Deathroll without hearing a single note of their music. I was gettinginto stuff like In Flames and Soilwork and various amazon reviews recommended Bodom as similar and even better. They were right! The first 4 Bodom albums are sheer brilliance in the melodic death metal scene. So needless to say my expectations were high for Are You Dead Yet?...i even bought an import copy because i couldn't wait for a proper UK release. Oh how disappointed i was.\n\nThis album starts off well enough, the opening pair of songs are pretty good, but there's obviously a different smell in the air on this one. Gone are the widdly power metal-esque riffs, gone are the black metal influenced vocals (although this started to happen at least one album earlier), gone is the speed. This is slower, heavier and groovier for the most part. The keyboards are utilised differently too, still there and still playing leads but somehow not the same. This album sounds....American i guess. As if the record label said 'guys, you'll break big if you change this, this and this'. So they did. So did In Flames and Soilwork sadly. \n\nThis change works on some stuff and not on others. Mainly because Alexi just isn't as good at writing this type of music. The vocal change has stuck for the most part and it's really just an out of tune semi-growl, clearer than before but this only serves to highlight the bad lyrics. His lyrics have always been atrocious in an amusing way and this album is only slightly worse than usual. The obvious exception being 'In Your Face', basically a lot of 'fucks' and hardman threats that come off sounding weak and pathetic. Shame really, cos i quite like the music to this one. 'If You Want Peace...Prepare For War' has always reminded me of Megadeth musically, which would be good but it's fairly boring despite the musical prowess on show. 'Punch Me I Bleed' sounds like WASP. make of that what you will. \n\nTracks 6, 7 and 9 i have no real comment on. Every time i listen to them i instantly forget them afterwards, just dull from what i recall. 'Trashed, Lost and Strungout' is the only good song on the latter half of the album, with a Slayer inspired riff at the start and a near return to their old sound in general. Bonus track is a cover of Billy Idol's 'Rebel Yell'. it's ok for what it is, Bodom have a long history of covers and this is far from the worst. \n\nSo overall this is a change of style and a change for the worse in my opinion. Blooddrunk was more of the same and it took another 2 albums before Bodom found their feet again. This isn't a terrible album but it has too many anonymous tracks, while the best tracks just aren't as good as previous work. Approach with caution.\n\nRecommended tracks: Living Dead Beat, Are You Dead Yet?, in Your Face, Trashed, Lost and Strungout.\n",
        "\nLet me justify my rage, in case the other reviews down below did not make it clear. After releasing four epic studio masterpieces and one medium-rare one, they give us the poorly produced, badly written, weakly developed, lazily crafted, immense fuck up that was Blooddrunk.\n\nI\u2019m going to let that name sink in for a moment. Repeat it a few times out loud, write it, I do not know, but its a very bad name. The past albums featured not only awe inducing, but powerful and eerie covers (except for Are You Dead Yet? But that is another story), yet Blooddrunk (ugh, I\u2019m already tired of typing it), have\u2026 I do not even fucking know. It is so convoluted! It looks like the reaper hitting something, and blood is coming out, and it delivers a blank and negative feeling.\n\nThat is the artwork, how does the sound catch up? Well, to put it simply, very bad. Okay, I\u2019ll try to contain myself from lapsing again. The first song \u201cHellhounds on My Trail\u201d (probably the only good song name found in here) is a fast-paced thrash pit. Before this Bodom already did some good fast songs. Silent Night, Bodom Night was pretty neat, and even their forced \u201cIn Your Face\u201d was a good rush. What\u2019s in store now? A song that is convoluted and confusing.. The production quality is horrible, and the drums sound terrible (the high hat feels as it belongs in a The Sword album, more than in a Bodom one), and the growls feel as robotic as Angela Gossow's. The creative riffs found in songs like Living Dead Beat, Follow the Reaper and Bodom After Midnight are not here. Not to say that the guitars are bad, they just sound unpolished. Also say goodbye to keyboard. Jane is as useless as Cristiano Trionfera was in Labyrinth. The keyboards that once delivered jaw-dropping riffs are now only to build an atmosphere.\n\nWhy am I focusing all on the first song? To explain that, I\u2019ll say that the originality wore off, and the songs all sound the same. The only difference is the pace. Some are fast as shit, like Roadkill Morning, and there are some slow ones, like Banned From Heaven. Oh yes, Banned From Heaven. What most people consider the worst song ever made by the Bodom boys, and it is forced as all Hell. The keys are boring, and mostly uncreative, the vocals are atrocious, and the worst part is that this is the longest track on the album.\n\nEvery single aspect of this album feels wrong. I get the feeling that they went for a more Hatecrew sound (the bass is a good example, and the lack of melodies and the clusterfuck of headbanging oriented sounds are good examples of why I say this) but still held on to the structure and songwriting used in Are You dead Yet? and Follow the Reaper. It is as they tried mixing both styles at the same time. The problem is that it failed. They could not find a point that connected these two, and decided to play halfway through the path. If not, this could have been a great release. However, the mix of styles, the poorly written drums and guitar lines, the lazy solos and lack of keyboards left me a dry mouth, even to comment on how rushed this production was.\n\nWith all that said, is there a redeeming factor on this? Yes. To be honest, there are only a few. The ending of Smile Pretty For the Devil has a keyboard/guitar outro that is well thought out. The song Tie My Rope has an epic chorus, even though it is a clusterfuck of instruments, and Done With Everything, Die for Nothing has some cool breakdowns. I guess that is all to say. Songs feel more recycled than Powerwolf albums. The aforementioned Smile Pretty For the Devil resembles Are You Dead Yet? (And so does the beginning of Done With Everything, Die for Nothing); Banned From Heaven sounds like Punch Me, I Bleed, but glossier and Lobodomy and One Day You Will Cry could be easily be in the \u201crejected tracks for Hatecrew Deathroll\u201d list.\n\nThat was Blooddrunk in a nutshell. It is not good. Its not even so bad it is good. To put it shortly, it is a failed experiment. I am not saying that failed experiments are bad, Fear of the Dark was one, and it was fantastic. It falls flat because of a rushed production, a set of uncreative riffs and a lack of substance. It was certainly a nice try, and I respect them for trying, but if it failed, it failed.\n\nOh, by the way, the cover they did for Ghost Riders In The Sky in the limited edition was also bad. Chrome Division and Die Apokalyptischen Reiter did better versions of it.\n",
        "\nWhile I do consider myself a fairly intense Children of Bodom fan, I have not been too much of a fan of their most recent releases. Granted, achieving the brilliance of an album like 'Follow the Reaper' (one of my all time favorite extreme power metal albums) would be difficult for any group, but I found the change of direction exhibited in the records 'Blooddrunk' and 'Relentless Reckless Forever' to not grip me nearly as much as CoB's classic material. So, I was not expecting much when I heard that Alexi Laiho and company were going to release another record, 'Halo of Blood.' But boy was I mistaken. \n\nWhat makes 'Halo of Blood' such a true return to form is that the band is exploring themselves musically and creating exciting musical moments just as much as their classic albums. I realize that 'shred' may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me the biggest appeal in CoB was always the musicianship: Janne Wirman's keyboard leads are always inventive and tasty, and Laiho's lead playing, at its best, rocks HARD. These more power-metally elements are on display in full force on this record. While every track has great solos and inventive musicianship, I have to say my favorite track in this regard is 'Bodom Blue Moon.' The whole song is a collection of technical lead guitar lines and memorable riffs, but for me as a keyboardist, the highlight of the song is the keyboard lead in the song's final moments, where Wirman shows off his chops with a deliciously creative keyboard lead. Roope on rhythm guitar, Jaska on drums, and Henkka on bass all deliver more than competent performances, but to be honest if you're listening to hear some mindblowingly awesome metal drum tracks, you're probably better off checking out Dream Theater or something. Nothing against Jaska though, because his parts on this album suit the music perfectly. Vocally, Laiho delivers strong performances throughout. His lyrics on the album are at times cringe-worthy, but then again, I personally have never listened to Bodom for the purposes of hearing life-changing, profound lyrical content...\n\nAll this being said, this album is not QUITE up to par with 'Reaper.' I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I don't think Bodom will ever quite top the magic of that record, or capture its pure energy and virtuosity. However, 'Halo of Blood' is certainly miles better than it's two predecessors, and signals a return to form that should make old-school Children of Bodom fans happy to say the least.\n",
        "\nLet me make it very clear. This album is NOWHERE in the scale of Hatebreeder or Follow The Reaper but this is one of the most solid offerings by the Finnish melodic death metal quintet. It is highly likely that Children of Bodom finally realized how crappy and disgusting their last three albums were and wanted to deliver an album which would be comparable to their old sound. Soul searching and introspection definitely seemed to have worked. \n\nMaking mistakes and realizing them after a certain period of time is human nature. What took them so long to correct their errors or blunders is something I don't quite understand but I am pleased that they finally did. Better late than never, as the old saying goes. Halo of Blood is an answer to what fans of old Bodom wanted in nearly eight years. It is a perfect return to form and every song of the album is pure, in-your-face metal. It reminds us of the quality of work that is generally expected from Alexi and co. Right from the opening riff and the melody of Waste of Skin that sounds very similar to 'Hate Me', to the ending theme of 'One Bottle and a Knee Deep', every freaking sound is unique and fresh. The black metal-ish title track is definitely the fastest song ever done by CoB and an esoteric reference to the Indian Goddess Kali on 'Dead Man's Hands on You' was the last thing I expected from them. Profanities have been kept to a bare minimum and are almost non existent. 'Transference' seemed more of a filler at first but it has completely grown on me in nearly two or three months after its release.\n\n'Scream for Silence' is one track that I am not quite fond of in spite of it being highly melodic and catchy. 'All Twisted' and 'Bodom Blue Moon' are poised to become fan favorites in the years to come. The guitar work by Alexi is phenomenal as usual and sometimes I wonder whether he has taken his guitar playing abilities to new heights. Jaane Wirman is a beast on the keys, playing intensely melodic solos reminiscent of his previous works in Follow The Reaper or Hatebreeder. Wounds have been healed, skeptics and agnostics like me have been slapped tightly by highly coherent and structured songs, pounding riffs and blistering guitar/keyboard solos , and prayers have been answered for those who believe in a higher power. I will finish this review by thanking Alexi and co. for this incredible piece of work. I hope these men from Finland continue in this direction and make amazing albums like this in the future. \n\nFavorite tracks- Bodom Blue Moon, One Bottle and a Knee Deep, All Twisted.\n",
        "\nI will kick right into the review stating that Children of Bodom are definitely back in the right direction. For almost a decade, most of us have been crying out for them to get back to their black metal-influenced, speed-driven sound and they have returned to just that. Halo of Blood is every bit what we wanted them to do and I daresay, there are some moments where they even exceed our expectations!\n\nTalking about the overall sound of the album, it is halfway between being raw and being well-produced. The musical ideas pretty much wander around old school death, thrash, and black metal, giving us that raw, cold sound. On the other hand, a much more watchful effort has been taken to ensure that all instruments are heard in the best possible quality. The vocals and lyrics have also improved and have a fervent belligerence to it. Most notably, Dead Man's Hand on You, which deals with romantic emotions towards the Indian goddess, Kali...something I never expected Children of Bodom to do.\n\nAlexi and Roope have concocted some really intense guitar work both in terms of the structuring of riffs and showcasing of their technical prowess. I personally am one of those few people who was not completely put off by the guitar work in the last couple of albums and it has now become evidently better, in Halo of Blood. The main reason is that the leads and melodies are driving the songs more than often and it adds up to the catchy-ness and flow of the songs, while Roope's rhythm section is strong and innovative.\n\nKeyboards have always been a HUGE element of Bodom\u2019s sound and while they are still there doing what they are meant to do, I felt certain parts could have had them a wee bit louder in the mix, especially in songs like Waste of Skin and Halo of Blood, as they are almost not to be heard with just some feeble choirs. However, there are some really melodic and technical keyboard solos this time around with admirable consistency. Scream for Silence, in particular, comes to mind. My only complaint with the keyboard parts, apart from them being negligently mixed, is that they continue to blindly accompany the guitars, which was NEVER the case in the first two albums. Janne Wirman should stop keeping his best ideas for Warmen (which is stupid to say cuz that is just an uninteresting, pop rock side project nowadays with only two instrumentals per album) and instead fully keep Bodom as his main focus. I hope he uses some new patches and \"individually composed parts\" so that it's not just Alexi who takes all the credit for songwriting.\n\nJaska was always an underrated drummer in the metal scene, but with the return of relentless blast beats and fast double bass work, he redeems his position as one of THE metal drummers out there. Not just in the fast songs, but also in the slower numbers like Dead Man\u2019s Hand on You, he handles the drum lines with absolute composure and taste. It was a bit disappointing to see Henkka not getting that much to do, but he provides a solid backdrop to add to the heaviness of the songs.\n\nAs for the best song on the album, I would hand it over to Bodom Blue Moon. Simply because its the kind of song that Bodom are actually meant to be delivering. Both in terms of composition and skill, this utilizes the pinnacle elements from Bodom's arsenal. The intro itself is a guitar/ keyboard unison run with a change in key signature, something that might be a solo for certain bands out there. The chorus section is one of the tastiest arpeggios ever played by Bodom and the song has probably one of the most melodious guitar solos ever by Alexi to add to their humongous list. The song ends with a pinchy, death-thrash riff that culminates into a weird, alien-esque keyboard solo by Janne, which I am sure is gonna be immensely difficult to learn how to play.\n\nThis is the album where Bodom have embraced the Hatebreeder sound with some of the intensity of their latter albums. It is the kind of return which none of us expected, but were wanting very badly. If this is the direction they are going to take, then I am certainly a happy man!\n\nMust listens: Halo of Blood, Scream for Silence, Bodom Blue Moon, All Twisted.\n",
        "\nI'm only giving this release a \"B\" average because it lacks ingenuity, but it's definitely better than some of their previous releases. The riffs are very melodic in nature, however Alexi's epistemology regarding songwriting is lacking originality. Sure, the riffs sound good, don't get me wrong about that, but COB needs ingenuity. The production quality is superior to previous recordings, which is a definite plus. The guitars, bass, drums and keyboards blend in nicely. The vocals don't overshadow the guitar riffs and they're in unison with the playing. The leads were blindingly fast and technical, reflecting the band's progression from its predecessors.\n\nBeing a former guitar player, I would say that the songwriting is decent and in some respects a little bit more in unison with the keys that did drown out the guitars on earlier releases, namely \"Hate Crew Deathroll\". That album is a classic, but a lot of the songs stressed more of what was done mixing in the keys too much, which did overshadow the guitars on some songs, just not on this one. Like I mentioned, everything blended in casually and Alexi again flared his playing with a lot of influences, especially Mozart, when it came to writing the riffs and leads reflecting (to me) that of the works of the legend Joe Satriani.\n\nThis release is more of a melodic death-type of album instead of a melodic death/power metal album. It's filled with relentless energy and emotion, sort of like that of the Amott brothers during Arch Enemy's earlier days, just not as heavy and brutal as those first 3 releases of AE's. Alexi is still powered up on vocals, spewing out hatred and furious vox that keeps the music really aggressive. The clean tone segments were few here and not many instances where they are featured song-wise. Pretty much most of the songs are highly musical and actually worth hearing many times without lessening in outward disinterest.\n\nAlexi (I think) has gone through peaks and valleys when it comes to previous releases, knowing that on some albums they are kind of just \"crowd pleasers\" rather than original pieces of melodic death/power metal that COB demonstrated on \"Restless, Relentless, Forever\" and \"Are You Dead Yet\". With \"Halo of Blood\", it is more intriguing to listen to, plus as I've already said the production quality has made this album a much higher quality release than these previous other releases. Their hatred is still rampant even though (to me) it isn't their most innovative piece of material.\n\nI'd admit to say that when I originally heard this, I was really upset with the lack of ingenuity factor, but after repeated listens I'd say that COB is still kicking ass. The lineup is pretty much the same as their previous ones and the backup vocals really augment the hate-spewed aggression that really stands out on this one. Get ready for some heavy duty blast beats as well with super tremolo-picked guitar melodies! I have yet to hear many bands that are melodic death/power metal, so (to me) it was surprising. A definite step up from their previous 2 releases and definitely a good one to buy and keep in your COB collection!\n",
        "\nWhen Children Of Bodom is about to release new material, I always hear that this will be something different and partly innovating, but in the bigger picture to me, Halo Of Blood is just a natural progress from their last album, Relentless Reckless Forever. With their now eighth album, they also prove that this type of metal is sort of narrow. Not being patronizing, but how many versions of these types of songs are a band able to create?\n\nThe songs are generally on a solid high level, but nothing extraordinary. The keyboard occasionally finds itself a bit lower in the mix than what we're used to, still being a vital element in their melodic death metal, though. The title track, Halo Of Blood, shows a more brutal side of the Finnish metallers and Dead Man's Hand On You sounds very In Flames and is as close to a ballad you can come within this type of music, yet in the end almost nothing has really changed significantly. It's still Children Of Bodom one hundred percent.\n\nThe trademark guitar play with its hooks and melodic parts are, as always, around. The same with Laiho's angry voice as he shouts his way throughout these forty-two minutes. A rather long album by their standards, actually. There's really nothing more to tell this time, so if you're a fan of this band, go buy this record. If you're not a fan, well\u2026give it a shot.\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nMake no mistake about it: Children Of Bodom were a massive part of my younger, formative years as a metal head. Albums like Hatebreeder and Follow The Reaper were, and are in fact still, personal favorites of mine. Since then, Children Of Bodom has become one of the bigger love/hate bands doing the rounds (if they weren\u2019t already); most of us who loved their earlier, power metal routed sound were particularly disgruntled with their last couple of albums. Alexi seemed to have turned his back on the fun European melodies, as well as the the prolonged guitar and keyboard battles (which earned the band\u2019s popularity in the first place). Instead, Bodom replaced those features with dumb, chugging riffs, Robb Flynn-style cheap aggression, and continually worsening song titles. A lot of people had completely written them off, and whilst I\u2019ve dipped in and out of their last few releases to find the odd gem, I didn\u2019t really hold out much hope\u2026\n\nHonestly, when I first listened to this album I\u2019d have to be lying if I said I was anything but gobsmacked. This is the kind of comeback I\u2019d always hoped for but never expected, and while this isn\u2019t the neoclassical madness of Hatebreeder or the mastery displayed on Follow The Reaper, it\u2019s the album they could have released after Hate Crew Deathroll. Nay, scratch that, they could have released this after Reaper. Everything that made Children Of Bodom so much fun is back in spades: the keyboards are back with a vengeance, Alexi isn\u2019t yelling profanities every other line, the riffs are killer, the melodies catchy, and there\u2019s even the odd step forward in the band\u2019s sound.\n\nKicking off with \u201cWaste Of Skin\u201d, the band mines a deep vein of nostalgia with a cracking melody and riff set which is both familiar and new. This has classic Children Of Bodom written all over until they kick into one of the best tracks they\u2019ve ever written. The title track is the absolute business: furious blast beats and Dissection-style riffs give me a serious Something Wild flashback. This is exactly what I want to hear from these guys. From here onwards, the band steamrolls the listener with a collection of mostly excellent tracks; \u201cScream For Silence\u201d shows them nailing their melodic side the best they have in years, \u201cBodom Blue Moon\u201d is a tour-de-force in pure Bodom excellence \u2013 look out for that killer keyboard solo towards the end. \u201cAll Twisted\u201d dishes out the goods in the riff department, making 2001 feel not so long ago. Even the film quotes are back, which had me beaming from ear to ear.\n\nIf there is anywhere Children Of Bodom goes wrong on Halo Of Blood, I\u2019d have to say it\u2019s in the slow song \u201cDead Man\u2019s Hand On You\u201d, which really isn\u2019t all that bad (I\u2019d take it over \u201cAngels Don\u2019t Kill\u201d any day). I\u2019d just say it kind of kills the buzz with the rest of the album being so bloody energetic, though I suppose it gives time for a rest and there is an absolute beaut of a riff in the middle. That\u2019s it though, the only negative is one song \u2013 and it\u2019s not even that bad.\n\nFrom the artwork, song titles, atmosphere, and of course the songs themselves: this is classic Bodom, through and through. Songs such as the title track, \u201cDead Mans Hand On You\u201d, and even \u201cTransference\u201d have enough bright ideas to keep the album from becoming merely a rehash of their earlier material, which sweetens an already damn sweet deal. To hear a return to form of this level from a band I grew up loving is an experience which can\u2019t be beaten. If you\u2019ve ever cared about this band, especially around the time of Follow The Reaper and Hate Crew Deathroll, (Hatebreeder this is not) then I can\u2019t recommend this enough.\n\nOriginally written for http://blackwindmetal.com\n",
        "\nThere has probably been no European metal band more innovative and more important in the twenty first century then Children of Bodom. In no short order, the band has created a new strain of melodic death metal that many critics believe is worthy of getting its own sub genre and they have legions of fans in virtually every corner of the world. Despite their acclaim however, Bodom had been in a band in a state of decline. Between experimenting with industrial influences, Alexi Laiho injuring himself at a bowling alley, the band member's rampant alcoholism, and probably all the global acclaim, resulted in the band producing three albums that were so so at best (eg. Blooddrunk) and god awful at worst (eg. Relentless, Reckless, Forever). The Bodom boys seemed more energetic about covering Eddie Murphy (for the record, I like their pop covers), Janne Wirman wanted to have more drunken homosexual innuendo ridden encounters with Alexi then play keyboard, and Alexi himself seemed like he was a slowed down, drunken shadow of the metal guitar master that he once was. Fans of the band then had honest questions to wonder where Children of Bodom were going to do when they found out that they were making a new album for 2013, and I imagine they expected Bodom to only regress further, making us long more and more for their amazing first four albums from yesteryear. \n\nInstead, Bodom have done a near 180 degree turnaround. In the span of a few years, Children of Boodm shed themselves of most of the elements from their past three albums, reinserted most of the good stuff from the first four albums, and have come up with one of the best albums they have ever created. Children of Boodm have done something special with Halo of Blood. Not only have they \"returned to form\", but they have actually managed to create music that, at several times, sounds like nothing the band has ever done, and all of it is resoundingly successful. \n\nCritics who reviewed this album before me have noted two things that separate Halo of Blood from Are you Dead Yet, Hate Crew Death Roll, and Relentless Reckless Forever. First and foremost is the abandoning of the ever growing feel of chugging that you can hear on all Children of Bodom albums after Hate Crew Death Roll. Right from the opener, Waste of Skin, Halo of Blood is littered harmonies that are strung together as good as Alexi and company have done since Follow the Reaper. Though the harmonies and their transitions are not quite as accomplished or epic as that album, they more then make up for lack harmonies on the last three albums. Not only that, Halo of Blood finally puts to bed the idea that Alexander Kuoppala's departure and Roope Latvala's introduction as Bodom's rhythm guitarist was somehow detrimental to the band, an argument that I am happy to see die after this album. \n\nThe other aspect of Halo of Blood that critics have noted is keyboardist Janne Warmen's return to prominence. Janne's performance on Halo of Blood is a highly commendable one, returning with some of the jazziest and slickest work he has done on a Children of Bodom album. Using a mix of sounds from the synths of Are you Dead Yet to harpsichord keys that were so prevalent on Follow the Reaper, the keyboard work on Halo of Blood is the best that Children of Bodom has done in years. The key lines provide some of the eeriest ambiance that has ever been heard on a Children of Bodom album, with the orchestration on Dead Man's Hand on You being one of the most beautiful that Janne has ever played, and his performance is thoroughly impressive. \n\nAnd there are even more \"return to form\" elements. Alexi's guitar solos, after being somewhat lacking on the three albums that preceded Halo of Blood, have returned with a vengeance, being some of of the fastest and most accomplished that he has done. The chanting background vocals, a hallmark on Bodom's earlier albums, are back in a much more full force role, opting for one to two word shouts rather ten the whole lines of words that were so prominent on Relentless, Reckless, Forever. Jaske Raatikanen brings one of the most inspired performances he's ever done on a Children of Bodom album, breaking out blast beats on the title track the likes of which he has not played since Hatebreeder. There is even a visceral improvement in Alexi Laiho's vocals, vocals which have never sounded more guttural or vicious then ever before. \n\nCredit also must be given to Peter Tatgren, the producer of this album. Tatrgen, for those who do not know, was the producer of Follow the Reaper, and his contribution deserves a little bit of praise. Perhaps sensing a need to get back to basics, Bodom enlisted Tatrgen to help guide them in the direction that they had taken up earlier in their career. While I do not know exactly how much Peter contributed to the overall composition of Halo of Blood (chances are it was probably was not as much as I think), the production values and mix on this album are top notch. Children of Bodom albums are not meant to be \"walls of sound\" or extremely loud. They are not meant to bombard the listener with an overload of sound waves. Tatrgen opts for a mix very much akin to Halo of Blood, with very dirty sounding guitars, more organic sounding drums, and high levels of vocal production. It is an impressive album to listen to, and I cannot thank Tatrgen enough for making sure it was. \n\nIs Halo of Blood perfect? No, not by any stretch. Does it have it's flaws? Sure. The band still seems to want to get into a few unnecessary palm muting chug sessions, but those are livable and fewer then they have been then the past three albums. Are there times when I think there is still too much singing and not enough instrumentation? Sure, yet I am willing to overlook that. Perhaps the album's biggest flaw is that at times Bodom seems too eager to atone for past mistakes and simply redo certain songs. For example, Scream for Silence sounds like a redux of Roundtrip to Hell and Back (from Relentless, Reckless, Forever), with better arrangements and a stronger composition. The same goes for Your Days are numbered, which is an almost shameless redo on Blooddrunk's track Smile Pretty for the Devil. The last thing I want Children of Bodom to do is try to go back and correct past mistakes, I would prefer if the band just moved forward and learned from what they did rather then try to correct what they have already done. \n\nDespite these flaws, Halo of Blood is a great album by Children of Bodom, and the first truly strong album they have done in nearly eight years. Getting back to the fundamentals of their sound while making improvements in certain areas, Children of Bodom have shed away any signs of rust and decay that may have been apparent on the past few albums and instead shine brightly like a great star over the Scandinavian sky. So grab yourself a copy and let Alexi and company show you back to Lake Bodom, because times are good for Finland's leading guitar master and his motley crew of talented musicians.\n",
        "\nMuch like Overkill with their string of slower and unenergetic albums, Children of Bodom has been a band I've been waiting to \"come back\" for a long time. Also similar to Overkill, Children of Bodom was one of the bands that truly excelled in bringing pure metallic ENERGY to metal. I knew both bands had it in them, as they both had released some of my favorite metal albums of all time. And much like \"Ironbound\" rekindled my love of Overkill, \"Halo of Blood\" has rekindled my love of Children of Bodom. \n\nWithin the first 30 seconds of the album, you become aware that this is not the logical successor to \"Relentless Reckless Forever\". The feel of that very first main melody immediately brings back that old familiar CoB feeling of the first four albums. That certain something of the melodies, keyboards and tempos that really do capture what CoB really is. Whatever \"it\" is, it's there. And it's here on the album in general. \n\nChildren of Bodom is built for melody and speed, not heaviness and chugging riffs. They're finally back to what they do as good as or better than anyone in my opinion. They're letting the true talents of all the members really shine, and it seems to reignite passion and energy within the band members. \n\nIn general, \"the faster and more melodic, the better\" is how I view Children of Bodom songs. That applies here as well, and I'm fully aware that that is likely just an issue with me and my love of fast tempos. But there's more than enough melody in the few mid-paced (and one slow (!)) songs to keep them exciting, which for me is saying something. \n\nI'm not sure I can say exactly where this album would fit in in the landscape of different sounding CoB albums. It's not Hatebreeder Part II, nor is it Hatecrew Deathroll Part II. I'd say if you could musically combine their first four albums (and the good songs off \"Are you Dead Yet?\") and sum them all together, then give some sort of musical average of their sound and feel, you'd have this album. \n\nIn short, I'm absolutely thrilled with this album. It's about as much of an incredibly pleasant surprise to me as Overkill's \"Ironbound\" was, and for the first time in what feels like forever, I'm eager and excited to see what Alexi and Co. will be doing in future musical releases.\n",
        "\nThey finally got it right. Finally. It\u2019s been a long time since there\u2019s been much excitement regarding the release of a new Children of Bodom record; a band largely pegged as the Metallica of melodic death metal. That is, a band that made a profound impact with their early albums, but divided the metal community following later releases in a more commercial format; exchanging black metal roots and neo-classical compositions for a more riff-oriented, Lamb of God style and a place on the Hot Topic shelf. Let\u2019s get something straight guys: Children of Bodom are NEVER going back to Hatebreeder, no matter how much you bombard them through YouTube or fan-mail. Nonetheless, it\u2019s painfully clear that the band needs a huge breath of fresh air following the rather stale and very forgettable Relentless Reckless Forever. Their latest offering in Halo of Blood gives us just that, and is hands-down Children of Bodom\u2019s strongest offering since 2003's Hate Crew Deathroll.\n\nThere are many \u201cwhat-if\u201d questions in the timeline of heavy metal. What if Randy Rhoads never got on that plane? What if Metallica didn\u2019t give Dave Mustaine the boot? What if Jari didn\u2019t take 8 years to release half of Time? Probably asked frequently amongst half of the polarized CoB fanbase is what if Bodom didn\u2019t jump on the commercial bandwagon after Hate Crew Deathroll? Well, the answer can be found on Halo of Blood, which effectively combines the heavier, power thrashing style they\u2019ve become accustomed to, with their early black metal influence and sense of melody that made them so loved in the beginning. Die-hard fans will be teeming with excitement upon hearing the lead-off track, Waste of Skin (think \u201cHate Me!\u201d), which kicks things off with one of their trademark catchy melodies and is the first of many old school Bodom moments to come. Right away the listener is thrown into the comfort zone of the glory days, which is great considering the lack of those moments in the band\u2019s recent work. Bodom Blue Moon, All Twisted, and One Bottle and a Knee Deep are all trademark Bodom tracks that will quickly become fan favorites.\n\nFunny how they choose to release an album with a winter atmosphere in June, but it\u2019s a presence most welcomed and gives Janne\u2019s keys some meaning again. You can thank him for the black metal feeling, as its influence is definitely felt. Alexi\u2019s guitar-work is ace as usual, and even makes some room for Roope, who is a brilliant guitarist himself, to throw in a solo or two. It would be refreshing to see a little more of him though, perhaps in a more tag-team role as he and Alexi shared in Sinergy. Then again, Sinergy didn\u2019t have Janne Warmen. It\u2019s always great to hear him and Alexi going at it with the vigorous, yet friendly competition they have. Henkka\u2019s bass is in the mix doing its thing, and ahhhh, blastbeats\u2026 Jaska serves them up for the first time in ages and is the typically excellent backbone of the music of Children of Bodom. The actual musicianship of these guys has never been questioned, and they continue to produce in peak form.\n\nHalo of Blood is littered with pleasant surprises, using elements both familiar and new to the CoB style. First and foremost is the title track that is borderline black metal, and stands out as one of the heaviest Bodom tunes ever. Then there\u2019s the dark ballad \u201cDead Man\u2019s Hand on You,\u201d the slow song that everyone has been talking about. Hearing Children of Bodom coming out with, I shit you not, a grand piano, clean guitars, and (what sound like) sensitive lyrics should be flabbergasting. But like Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s famous kitten shirt, it doesn\u2019t feel one bit out of place and can even be considered a transcending point for the band. Given their typical aggressiveness, it\u2019s great to hear them take a step outside their usual domain and take a risk.\n\nPossibly the most diverse music in their catalogue, Halo of Blood is without a doubt, the most innovative and exciting record Children of Bodom has released in a decade. Sure, there\u2019s still going to be those nose-picking naysayers who will bitch and moan that it isn\u2019t Hatebreeder II. If that's what you're expecting you might as well just throw on Hatebreeder and not waste your time; indeed, it would be wrong to call Halo of Blood a full-on back to roots album. What it is however, is the fine product of a fantastic band that has established growth in their sound righting the ship and resuming course. Safe sailing Alexi and Co. just stay afloat this time please\u2026\n\nHighlight Tracks: Waste of Skin, Halo of Blood, Dead Man\u2019s Hand on You, All Twisted\n\nOriginally written for: dermetalkrieger.com\n",
        "\nOver the years, I've managed to review five of Bodom's then-current seven albums (don't read the first four of them, for your sanity's sake). They're not a band I ever really set out to constantly cover, but when a band is as important to me as this one is/was, and when said band finds itself on such a consistently downwards slide, it's hard not to pipe up every time they disappoint you. I maintain, even after all these years, that Follow the Reaper is one of the most important albums in my development as a metal fan, helping ease me from the HerPeS-only mindset into more and more extreme metal thanks to my eventual acclimation with Alexi Laiho's frenzied yowling. The vocals and lyrics have always technically sucked, but the level of enthusiasm was so high that it never mattered. It fit perfectly and just the sheer amount of fun the band was having with the light melodies and preposterously wanky dueling solos rubbed off on the listener. That all changed with Are You Dead Yet?, which focused more on heavy chugging and less on guitar/keyboard theatrics and fast paced and fun melodies. Ever since then, the band has been on the steady decline, releasing three crappy mostly-melodeath albums with wretched lyrics, banal, insipid jokes for cover tracks, and just really lazy songwriting. Years and years we fans have put up with the band just not giving a single fuck about anything, churning out brainless albums every few years, collecting a paycheck, spending it all on booze, and then making another shitty album to pay for their next supply of booze.\n\nAnd then 2013 rolls around, and queue in Halo of Blood, the band's eighth album. Right off the bat, the aesthetics felt kinda different. The last three (bad) albums had all portrayed Roy in a more straightforward and vicious light, rife with menacing poses and gory splatter, whereas the earlier albums I love so much always seemed to portray the embodiment of death in a more romantic, mysterious light. Compare the cover for Follow the Reaper, where the Reaper is standing calmly in a graveyard, beckoning you forth, to the cover of Blooddrunk, where he's viciously slashing somebody with blood splattered all over the place. From \"Death be not proud...\" to \"I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK MOTHERFUCKER!\" Clearly two massively different approaches to both their aesthetics and their music itself. Halo of Blood rolls around and suddenly it looks much more subdued. The palette is very predominately white (which could symbolize something lighter than previous, less dark), with the trademark Grim Reaper looking down remorsefully upon a frozen lake; where the snow has been brushed away you can see the water is packed with screaming victims, frozen under the surface. This is intriguing, this piques my interest. That romanticized take on death that used to counteract the band's youthful exuberance is so much more interesting than the last three albums which simply reaffirm the band's juvenile nature. \n\nBut moving past that... yeah, the throwback artwork is 100% indicative of the sound to be found on Halo of Blood. I could not be happier for what this album is, I really couldn't. The fifteen year old version of myself wet himself with happiness merely two tracks in. This is the true successor to Hate Crew Deathroll, ten sad years after the fact. As far as I'm concerned, this album just erased two and a half albums worth of ill will that Bodom had built up. Relentless Reckless Forever, Blooddrunk, and all but about three-ish songs on Are You Dead Yet? no longer exist to me. Bodom's drug fueled mishaps of the mid-late 00s were all just some strange hallucinatory fever dream I had. They never sucked! Hooray!\n\nThe important thing is that the music is good, right? Well, this album finally one-ups its predecessors by actually doing just that, making good music. The opening track, \"Waste of Skin\", utilizes a main melody quite similar to \"Hate Me\" from the stellar Follow the Reaper, and just revels in this lighthearted melody that the band used to always throw around in abundance. This is the throwback we've been waiting for, one that came straight from the heart, not the wallet. This is loaded with tracks that wouldn't sound out of place on the band's third or fourth albums (\"Waste of Skin\", \"Bodom Blue Moon\", \"One Bottle and a Knee Deep\", \"All Twisted\"), and this is the sound that I and countless other fans have been pining for for roughly ten years now. I feel like, somewhere down the line, Bodom got a wake up call of sorts. I'm not sure what or where or how, but the band collectively realized that they just weren't connecting like they used to, and had to think about how to stir up the passion within their fans again. The trick was to just... just try again. It's clear to me that the band wasn't didn't really have their heart in the last two albums, as they all just seemed to kind of go through the motions. Halo of Blood feels like the band is pouring themselves into the writing process again. They're having fun again, and for the first time in years, so am I.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend that there are a wide array of influences at work, but there are indeed a few different moments. Most notable is the nearly Dissection-esque meloblack influence in the title track, which ranks among the fastest songs the band has ever written. I'm most pleased with the fact that Bodom went back to doing what they did best, but that doesn't mean I don't also appreciate them trying something new (mostly because it works, as opposed to the last three albums of new ideas). There are a few bum spots as well, since there are still some minor holdover from the chuggy days with \"Damage Beyond Repair\". And yet again we have one of their kinda-trademarked terrible slow songs here in \"Dead Man's Hand on You\". Really, does anybody honestly prefer the slow Bodom songs like \"Angels Don't Kill\" or \"Banned from Heaven\" over \"Towards Dead End\" or \"Kissing the Shadows\"? If you do, I've got a fiver on you also preferring the doomy Overkill songs, you freak of nature. The point is that they're an inherently energetic band, so toning it down really doesn't do them any favors. It's like Stone Cold Steve Austin hosting a cooking show where he never once puts a crowd member through a table or Stone Cold Stunners Rachel Ray, it's a situation wherein the band/host isn't playing to their strengths. \"Scream for Silence\" does the same thing, but it's got a better pace and moves along well enough to not be too irritating (though the main melody has a really obviously flat note that seems completely out of place, which is irritating since it repeats so much). \n\nBut with those quibbles aside, there isn't a whole lot I dislike about Halo of Blood. It's the best kind of reversion I could have ever asked for. The keys are back in a relatively prominent role (much more so than the fuck all they did on Blooddrunk), ripping through overindulgent solo battles with Laiho's lead guitar just like the old days, along with providing melodies over the verses and such. \"All Twisted\" and \"One Bottle and a Knee Deep\" are great examples of this hearkening back to the glory days. He still doesn't let loose as much as he does for Warmen, but he does finally get some more opportunities to exercise those wacky spiderfingers of his. After several, several listens, I still can't tell if the lyrics are as drop dead derpy as they always have been, but to the album's credit, there aren't any titles as fucknards stupid as \"Northpole Throwdown\" this time around, and I'm not hearing \"YOW\" at the beginning of every single song nor \"FUCK\" at every sixth word, so it seems like Laiho has finally, finally learned how to write lyrics. There's a good possibility I'm wrong though, feel free to point out any horrid examples I may have missed. Even the cover song is good again. I mean think about it, early on the band was covering Iron Maiden, Stone, and W.A.S.P., and then around the time they started getting shitty, they started covering Britney Spears, Kenny Rogers, and Eddie Murphy. Their cover song has always been a good indicator of their attitude at the time, and they morphed from musicians having fun and covering their influences to a bunch of durr hurr lol random Invader Zim dipshits covering anything they thought was funny. So who do we get this time around? The mo'fuckin' Thunder in the East, LOUDNESS! Yeah, \"Crazy Nights\" is a kind of silly song, but it's silly in how over the top cheesy it is, as opposed to silly in the sense of METAL BAND COVERING POP SONGS?! OH PSHAW! They're tackling metal again, and it's awesome.\n\nThat melodic death/power metal hybrid I've been missing so much is back in full force, and Bodom fans around the world should rejoice, for the band has finally pulled their collective heads out of each other's collective asses. This still have a focus on heaviness in parts, as opposed to the \"really fast Nightwish songs with ridiculous screechy vocals\" of the first two/three albums, so if you didn't like Hate Crew Deathroll, then chances are you won't like Halo of Blood either. But let me tell you, I (and thousands of other fans) would much rather have a Hate Crew 2: Electric Boogaloo than Blooddrunk 2: Drunk Harder. Comeback of the year for me, hands down.\n\n\nOriginally written (with added visual aid!) for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nIt has been over half a decade since the release of Bodom\u2019s most hated album. Yeah, it is. A vast majority of fans blame the evident diminution of Janne Wirman\u2019s keyboard melodies, which was a renowned characteristic of their sound since their debut. On the other hand, some say the hatred is due to the hippy-dippy, emo-esque lyrical content and vocal deliveries. They even seem to have borrowed some \u201cideas\u201d from some \u201cfamous\u201d bands. I daresay, it still holds some value. At least, its better than some bands of the genre have tried to do.\n\nThe unisons and solos are still there, but only for the sake of it. It may seem like that maybe due to the chugga-chugga nature of the songs. But if you take out the solos individually, you will notice that most of it is rushed and done only to retain the characteristics that made them famous. The addition of Roope Latvala is apparent only in the rhythm section but as a lead technician, he hardly contributes to the solos. Certain songs have really nice intros and chorus sections but then the rest of the parts are just pointless and bland. Unless you have had an overdose of notes listening to some jazz band or a solo project and just want to listen to something atonal and simple, you may not necessarily enjoy this album.\n\nTalking about keyboards, Janne Wirman walks away during live shows as he is not needed. I guess that says it all. He does use some new patches as well which mostly sound industrial and poppy, but even those new elements are used restrictively and make the songs sound very guitar oriented. His soloing isn't really up to the mark this time. Whatever he plays sounds random and unplanned. Although, it somehow sticks to your mind after a couple of listens and then starts to make some sense, you may not be overtly impressed after hearing his technique and composing astuteness on the previous albums. His dual-section solo on We're Not Gonna Fall is quite impressive though, with a Black Widow touch to it...if you know what I mean.\n\nThey also seem to copy some riffs from here and there. Trashed, Lost and Strungout is a rip off of Slipknot's Sic. To put it plain and simple. Since most of what Bodom have done so far was original and fresh, this would be baffling to some. Even, that is. The song titles and lyrics are childish (swear words thrown in meaninglessly) and do not have any references to the Lake Bodom murders or a reaper hunting you down. Whatever they intended, or whatever they were going through, it doesn't give out a good impression about the band.\n\nIf you are new to metal or if you are a musician who just wants to have some casual fun, then please go ahead with this album. Its okay if you listen to Slipknot. It's okay if you feel better listening to songs that use swear words to vent out frustration! It's okay if you like simplicity and a bit of straight-forwardness and only occasional complexity. A lot of people come back to this from time to time but only for a certain part or a solo. But with Bodom standards, not one song in this album is worth a complete listen. IMO, they should not ave released this album. Instead, joined parts of different songs and released it in Blooddrunk. I am only hoping that they made this album purely with the purpose of being \u201cfamous\u201d in the States and get some cashflow coming in. If that was really their plan, then mission accomplished for them! Really!\n",
        "\nAh, Children of Bodom... probably the most influential and greatest melodeath band ever (in their prime that is). While In Flames, Dark Tranquility, and At the Gates pioneered the genre, Children of Bodom took it to a whole new level, mixing it with power, neo-classical, and black metal influences that fascinated the heavy metal world and inspired countless bands to follow in their footsteps, While some good acts like Norther and Imperanon came out of the Finnish melodeath/power metal scene soon after, none of them came close to matching the perfection that Bodom achieved with their early albums.\n\nIt always annoys me to hear Bodom fanboys constantly praise 1999's Hatebreeder\" as their strongest release. A good album yes, but in my opinion, vastly overrated and does not come anywhere close to \"Follow the Reaper,\" which is perfect in every single aspect. There is not one bad song on this album, each track is completely original and composed in its own unique way. The musical format is considerably more straightforward than its two predecessors, as it focuses less on the shredding and more on the songwriting. That's not to say that this isn't one hell of an impressive guitar album, but the band drops the 15 riffs a song format and instead develops a formula for using less, but more heavy and tighter riffs. The classical influence is still here, although less prevalent, and honestly, that works much better here unlike Hatebreeder, when it was used just a little too excessively. On \"Follow the Reaper,\" they get it just right and perfect the concept of fusing technicality, with excellent songwriting for an outcome of just pure delicious, refreshing melodic death metal.\n\nAfter listening to \"Follow the Reaper\" for who knows how many times it's been now, I still can't find a single flaw. It's probably been said and heard a thousand times already but I cannot emphasize enough just how talented Alexi Laiho is. He possesses every single aspect of what makes up an excellent guitarist. His technical ability alone is impressive but what makes him so special is how his playing SOUNDS GOOD. Each solo is carefully composed with a specific purpose, that transitions from one part to the next like a story. And while he shreds like the one of the baddest motherfuckers the world has ever seen, he always incorporates structure, melody, and emotion with absolute mastery. And did I mention that he was only about nineteen years old when he wrote this? From the technical brilliance of \"Kissing the Shadows\" and \"Children of Decadence\" to the emotional soloing in \"Everytime I Die\", Laiho delivers the finest guitarwork of his career, and any guitar player who listens to this record all the way through surely can't deny that he is one of the masters.\n\nWhile the impressive guitar work is obviously a main staple here, the keyboards are what really make the album if you ask me. Take them away and all of a sudden \"Follow the Reaper\" loses that icy feeling and half of the melodic juice it contains. Oh, the intro to \"Mask of Sanity,\" it sends chills down my spine every time I hear it... To all you cheap carbon-copy melodeath bands out there, this is how it's done. They aren't over-saturated fills that are there just to be there, they're always providing their own useful contribution to the music. I've never been a huge fan of key shredding, but it works well here, as both musicians are at the top of their game and form a tight partnership, as Alexi and Janne trade off solos, harmonize, or simply layer their individual parts into an eargasmic outcome. \n\n\"Follow the Reaper\" really is mostly all about the guitars and keys, but that isn't to diminish the accomplishments of the other areas. Jaska's drumming is tight as always, and something that is really enjoyable about \"Follow the Reaper\" as opposed to later Children of Bodom records is that Alexi was still a decent vocalist who wrote semi-decent lyrics as opposed to more recent efforts. The vocals are where the black metal influence comes into play, and as my heart bleeds for black metal, I personally love it and wish Alexi's vocals didn't go down such a generic road in later records. Here, his voice possesses a vicious, black metal rasp that complements perfectly with the icy atmosphere of the music. The lyrics are pretty much normal Bodom stuff about the Lake Bodom murders, suicide, alcohol, and all that lovely shit. Nothing too artistic about them, but then again, who actually listens to Children of Bodom or this style of music in general for lyrics?\n\n\"Follow the Reaper\" set the bar high for melodeath back in the year 2000, a bar that countless bands tried to shoot for, but could never quite match. Maybe that's why the genre has gone downhill since, including the band themselves. But that's another matter. What Children of Bodom achieved with their first four albums is set in stone and forever hailed as masterpieces in the hall of heavy metal. This is it right here, the strongest offering of a band in the prime of their career, and arguably the most definitive and greatest melodic death metal album ever. Just sit back, relax, and let the reaper engulf you in melodic, breathtaking darkness.\n\nHighlight Tracks: Follow the Reaper, Children of Decadence, Everytime I Die, Mask of Sanity\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s really difficult to dish out perfect or near perfect reviews, especially for bands that receive as much hate internationally as Children of Bodom. Some will view this as the opinion of a man who cares nothing for depth, enjoys trends, or whatever else have you, and admitting adoration for a group as scoffed at as these Finns is potentially ruinous to my reputation with certain readers, as you will learn later on. However, to abandon the truth for the sake of acceptability is itself not at all acceptable, and I hope you\u2019ll bear with me. Indeed, the prevalent disgust with this band is not a viewpoint I can really look down upon, considering their recent departure from unique melodic dynamics into less challenging, more commercial fare, but as one of the strongest early influences of my past decade submersed in the world of metal, they\u2019ve dropped certain albums that will never decrease in value for me. That should be clear, if you\u2019ve read my reviews of their albums up to this point, and still haven\u2019t abandoned the Reaper Division.\n\nTruly, I\u2019m no stranger to enjoying bands that receive rabid hatred, being an unabashed supporter of Dimmu Borgir, In Flames, and Cradle of Filth (with some exceptions, of course), to name just a few. Bodom are one of the foremost within that realm, and though my opinion of them has dropped pretty severely in recent years, I just cannot help my unabashed, fanatical love for 3 of their records, of which this is the last. Fling the feces, disregard my future writings and opinions, do as you will, nothing will change the fact that Hate Crew Deathroll is a beast of carousing, grooving melodic death metal that I will never, ever, on pain of fucking death, tire of. It may not be perfect, but I love it like a brother, and this is an opinion derived from very nearly 10 years with this record as a constant companion.\n\nEvolution struck the band when crating this release, as they adhered to the 3rd Album Rule as it pertains to a band\u2019s defining characteristics, and future evolution. Yes, one can quite clearly see the roots of chunky, Americanized grooving here, along with a host of bad lyrics, but the devolution was not too far along, and really at this point did not actually feel like devolution at all, something that cannot be said for the ensuing, stomach-churning banality of Are You Dead Yet? The sound is much fuller than on the previous Follow the Reaper, in both production and inherent style. However, though that is a distinguishing characteristic, the immense quality here all comes down to the construction of the almighty riff, and in this instance they are strong, and they are legion.\n\nAlexi\u2019s style matured quite a bit between these two defining albums, much more solid and brick-like as opposed to the constant aerial melodies he had consistently wrought beforehand, and indeed the sound here is poppier overall, boasting a higher plateau of accessibility. However, it\u2019s a good kind of accessible. Utilizing a lot of deceptively simple rhythms, the songs are flowing, dynamic, and aggressive, with all manner of insanity happening at any given time. There are innumerable excellent riffing patterns here, and they\u2019re constructed in unfailingly memorable sequences. The lyrics can be pretty terrible, given, and they\u2019re the one pitfall that keeps this from perfection, but they aren\u2019t nearly as flagrantly stupid as in the next release. Still, there are host of embarrassing sections, due to not only the lack of writing skills, but in inherent, tough-bro message:\n\n\"Stop! Are you ever gonna stop tryin' to be on the way that we wanna go?\nFuck! It's pissing the fuck out of us when you don't understand the word 'no' !\nNow, you're tellin' that you'll win the war that's only battled cuz you're\ntoo dumb to die. That's right! You can take your war and shove it up your ass,\nthen close your eyes and say goodbye.\"\n\n....scathing.\n\nThat said, not all of them are so bad, and some even work well within the musical context. The caliber of the melodies and grooves, however, renders the writing mostly inconsequential, and sometimes a bit endearing (Did I ever hurt you in any way? If I did then hear my apology: Fuck you!). All the supporting musicians have grown as well, with truly admirable performances one and all. The guitar/keyboard harmonies are just a touch less numerous than on Follow the Reaper, but they do a lot of subtler interplay throughout, to the point where it does not feel like anything is missing, though the overarching style is decidedly different. All the progressions are pretty much pure gold, oozing trademark style the entire time. Yeah, it\u2019s flashy, but it\u2019s exciting and memorable as all holy fuck, and that\u2019s what matters.\n\nNeedled 24/7 immediately clues one in to the change in aesthetics, pulsing and crushing, with punctuation from the keys and infectious leads. The electronic elements were a bit weird at first, but they fit with the motif, as the keys spiral off or accentuate riffing patterns as is necessary. It may sound odd to say of a Bodom release, but I\u2019m still noticing interesting things going on in the background in these songs, even after a decade, be it a subtle keyboard line or an odd flourish of the bass. It\u2019s nothing of immense depth, given, but there are a lot of individual little sweet spots that aren\u2019t immediately noticeable as you focus in on the main sequence notation. Sixpounder is the only song I don\u2019t absolutely love (though I still like it), a dense chugging number containing an oddly dissonant chorus and face-palming proclamations of \u2018666!\u2019 The resounding stupidity of that small section still takes me out of the experience a bit. It\u2019s incredibly infectious music, though, and not to be taken too seriously, lest you put yourself in jeopardy of being no fun. Chokehold has a hurried, chugging central riff that goes off on quick, fibrous tangents, before relenting to the starry beauty of the keyboards and shoots a dual-solo money shot of melodious awesome right in your stunned face. Bodom Beach Terror boasts one of the most epic, infectious choruses on their career, with a suitably grandiose melodic backdrop for its murderous machinations.\n\nTruly, the highlights are all inclusive, from the mid-paced grandeur of Angels Don\u2019t Kill to the hilarious Japanese-flavored melody of Triple Corpse Hammerblow, the endearingly pissed-off thrashing of You\u2019re Better Off Dead, Lil\u2019 Bloodred Ridin\u2019 Hood in its wild compositional frenzy, and the titular and ravaging Hate Crew Deathroll itself. It\u2019s all just gravy, and Alexi\u2019s vocals are much more pronounced and varied than in the past, even displaying hints of melody themselves at times, though all in his trademark \u2018yowling\u2019 style.\n\nI often wonder how I would perceive Bodom had I not grown up with them, if my love for this (and its predecessors) is based purely on its own merits, or if nostalgia colors my perceptions to an unprofessional degree. Indeed, I\u2019ve had some crazy fucking times, nay, crazy YEARS, with this as background music, but I believe the stirring melodious patterns here would slap me in the face anyways, since they're just so unique and insane. Though it\u2019s not their best overall, Hate Crew Deathroll is the ultimate evolution of Children of Bodom, the last leap before a spectacular fall, with a quality and consistency that, as of now in October 2012, they have not even come close to attaining since. Short a couple of embarrassing lyrics and a paltry few riffs, this is an amazing record, and the brilliance of its successes minimize any complaints to afterthoughts. It may be silly, happy, and poetically useless, but it\u2019s some of the most fun I\u2019ve ever had, a trend that continues even today as I inevitably creep towards old age and death. This is pure belligerent melodic mayhem in its most distilled form, untouchable by passing years or the bands following depths of sell-out decrepitude. It\u2019s not quite perfect, barely eclipsed by Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper, but it\u2019s nevertheless one of my favorites for life.\n\nHate Crew is an absolute fist-pounding triumph that I will be listening to until I\u2019m either 6 feet under or go deaf, in which case I\u2019d soon die inside anyways. I don't quite think it's perfect, but it has a unique charm that no other record in the world can match. This may not be the be-all-end-all of creativity, depth, or musical achievement, but it continues to be one of the most pleasing and exciting pieces of music to ever grace my strange little slice of existence. \n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a testament to the power of the almighty riff that an album can be absolutely dynamic, fulfilling, and even groundbreaking without purveying a real amount of depth. In this case, the swirling clouds of guitar and keyboard notation dance in pissed-off harmony to create one of the most special listening experiences that the metal world has ever had to offer. Children of Bodom showed great promise with the loose, aggressive Something Wild, and reformed that passion into the taught, formidable foray into neo-classical melodic fury that was Hatebreeder. However, in Follow the Reaper, they attained the perfection of this formula, to a degree of quality and artistic success that they haven\u2019t come close to since, save for it\u2019s direct follow-up, Hate Crew Deathroll.\n\nAs with Hatebreeder, the formula is to simply follow Alexi\u2019s lead as he spirals out like a lightning storm covering the earth, each guitar line a razorblade, slicing along with its comrades to create a veritable hurricane of cutlery, moving with precision and skill wrought in the fires of pure, beautiful melody. As immortal as the leads, solos, harmonies, and epic guitar/keyboard battles were in Hatebreeder, I feel they are no less than twice as strong here. Suffice to say, this is perhaps the most immediately infectious album I have ever heard, and its bright, celeritous bombast is endlessly invigorating, having only grown in my heart within the past dozen years. \n\nFollow the Reaper is 38 minutes of up-beat, lightly blackened melodeath with the spirit of pure rebellion, riffing and snarling with concision and attitude. Alexi Laiho\u2019s vocals have taken on a purely high-register blackened yowl, and though the classical elements have been downplayed, he more than makes up for their absence with his own melodies, which are without exception perfect. His unique, identifiable style was really coming into its own here, and framed by the dynamic interplay of keyboardist Janne Warman, they veritably soar past the clouds, atmosphere, distant galaxies, and whatever deity you believe in, spitting in his face and giving him the finger for good measure.\n\nOf the 9 songs here, only one exceeds 5 minutes, the beautiful blast of Children of Decadence, whose needling leads twirl you around its finger before cracking you in the jaw with its chorus, an affirmation of wild brotherhood. Every song is a life-long highlight, though, from Bodom After Midnight with its pumping, spindly, grooving melodies, Mask of Sanity and its sheering, downright Asian keyboard emanations, the utterly satisfying leads in Hate Me!, or the end of Kissing the Shadows, which contains the best guitar/keyboard solo I have ever heard in my life, and the best of the bands career. In fact, every track contains such an exhibition, and even after almost a dozen years, they remain equally as captivating and impressive as the very first time I heard them.\n\nThis is not a record of complexity or depth, beyond the astounding skill of its two main melodic monsters as they playfully battle, and it doesn\u2019t need to be, not at all. The pure strength of the songwriting is still perhaps the catchiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard, always unceasingly creative in its natural flow, with memorable choruses abound. Most of all though, and a point I must reiterate from the Hatebreeder review, is that Follow the Reaper is just plain fucking fun. It is an absolute masterpiece in its own simple way, and I cannot think of an album I have more legitimate, excitable fun listening to, as its cheery, raucous spirit just works so well with my sensibilities. I certainly understand the point of view of people who accuse Bodom of being flashy, but come on, you\u2019d have to be a snarling, twisted, lame little troll to deny these obvious, impeccable charms. \n\nThis is the pinnacle, folks. Though the following Hate Crew has a bevy of charm, it is not quite as strong as this, as they began to integrate elements to gather popularity, while sacrificing integrity, a trend that would inevitable almost destroy them, and one they have yet to fully recover from. Follow the Reaper, though is absolutely pure in its energy, spirit, and notation, a crystalline monument that stands at my personal summit of melodic metal, along with a handful of other releases that will some day be revealed. It\u2019s so unabashedly simple, and so absolutely glorious, that for me, it is immortal. \n\nA 100% review is painfully over-utilized these days, often denoting nothing more than the next dose of ADD glory someone has listened to twice and thinks is \u2018fuckin epic man\u2019 (Fleshgod), but it\u2019s not an act I take lightly at all. 100% denotes perfection to the person in question, and not only that, absolute timelessness. If you give something 100%, and you\u2019re not listening to it for the rest of your life, you have failed at the art of critique. I say that not to demean, but to lend gravity to my own sense of responsibility in attributing such a score. I realize my passion here is not one shared by the metal populace at large, and this kind of happy, flashy metal will not appeal to everyone, but if you\u2019ve been holding out on this based on popular opinion, I beg of you to consider otherwise, and at least give it a chance. \n\nThe glory of early Bodom is not in ruminating emotional depth or haughty intelligence, but the glory of being truly alive, reveling in stark, stunning, beautiful immediacy. You can think way too hard, worrying about all manner of things like the past, future, the meaning of it all, or that pimple on your nose, and let those weighty thoughts and insecurities rule your opinion and heart, but it\u2019s only when you concede yourself to the moment that you truly live. So loosen the fuck up, put on Follow the Reaper, have another beer, ask that girl (or guy) you\u2019ve been thinking about to go to a show, or just eat some mushrooms and run around in the rain. Just stop thinking and live for a minute. Follow the Reaper thrives on this thrilling sensation of \u2018now\u2019, just having a load of fun doing its thing, not giving two shits if you like it or not, and that\u2019s its endlessly pervasive charm, one that eclipses almost all other melodic metal ever made. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s just so much goddamn fun, and that\u2019s perhaps the most important thing of all. As I get older, the more ridiculous and abstract life gets, the more important an album like this becomes. When it all comes down to it, we\u2019re just amusing ourselves in the void, and I can think of no better company than a record of such wonderful, boisterous, belligerent, and downright elegant charm. \n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nFrom now on we are enemies. You and I. Simple words, a simple statement, but one that acts as a prelude to an album of such character and excitement as to give me shivers to this day. I like to think this is an utterance from the guitars, as they challenge the keyboards to the epic 38 minute battle scene about to take place, to the detriment of your ability to breathe. The concept is simple as well: write classically inspired melodic death/power metal with harsh vocals and a blood-spitting, thrash attitude. To play my cards on the table in the first round, I consider this one of the highest peaks on the melodic metal mountain. Hatebreeder is the first part of Bodom\u2019s unholy trinity (along with its direct successors, Follow the Reaper and Hate Crew Deathroll), a piece of immortal music, with some of the best guitar leads the world has ever seen. There are truly precious few albums I love enough that I know, without any measure of doubt, will be with me all through my life, if I\u2019m lucky enough to live it, and on towards my grave. Hatebreeder was a prime influence in my connection to metal, and though it\u2019s just a hair away from perfection, has only grown in strength and longevity ever since.\n\nThe level of maturity is immediately evident, as the band are much more relaxed and precise than in their debut, the excitable and loose Something Wild. Alexi\u2019s vocals have also leveled out into an even snarl, and have begun to take on his trademark \u2018yowling\u2019 sensibility. The rhythm section of Henkka and Jaska has tightened considerably, pounding along with fury and grace, creating an unbreakable backbone for the real star of this show: the melodies. Oh, those sweet, delicious, battle-blazing melodies. Alexi\u2019s guitar lines here are just to die for, framed by his cohort in crime, Janne Warman on the keyboards, as they swirl and spiral through energetic, expressive, neo-classical galaxies, swooping and diving and battling in an effort to blow your mind, the audible equivalent of 100 pounds of dynamite. \n\nAt albums core, the aesthetics of the sound here are power metal and death metal, but the crystal clear, vibrant notation feels subtly blackened, though not as much as on the debut. Alexi\u2019s rasping also helps that feeling along, but the result is entirely too precise and uplifting to ever don such a moniker. Hatebreeder is the essence of simplicity, in terms of formula. Alexi writes riffs, and everyone else just tries to keep up, with Janne keeping pace and trading outlandish flourishes the whole way through. Alexi has a very unique riffing style, which would come even further into itself in the next few records, but the constant, needling leads here eclipse everything else. It\u2019s not just the level of skill or insanity in the flurries of notation, even the simpler melodies are so infectious as to feel like a sweet, sweet disease, climbing into your brain and staying there interminably. \n\nWarheart and Hatebreeder are intense and wild, fast-paced snowstorms of immaculate precision. Silent Night, Bodom Night, still a staple of their live show, features one of the best melodies in Bodom history, and an unforgettable chorus. Bed of Razors is literally just that, a strong slab of riffing with sharp, brilliant leads cutting out above, framed by ethereal keys, before they do battle high above in the heavenly spheres, veritably sundering worlds in the process. Cowards Dead End features a very Asian-flavored lead, with flutters of keyboards whirling about like cherry blossoms in the wind, leading to another inevitable epic battle toward songs end, the dueling tones like magic spells of fire and ice, clashing and brightening the dojo before it\u2019s completely set ablaze by the enrapturing dance. \n\nBlack Widow is a bit darker, but with one of the strongest choruses on the record, Alexi varying his vocal work for maximum epic effect, before the leads once again throw us to the sky. Wrath Within is like a biting wind, keyboards creeping up below the choppy riffing to bellow us higher and higher to watch another splendid exhibition. And it still gets better! Track 8, Children of Bodom, needles along through crisp riffing glaciers to the waiting coral-toned keys, which hold their ground and announce the coming bloodshed in a foreboding Castlevania style, before they both dart off, keeping pace with each other as the classical influences take over. Downfall, another one of their most popular tracks, ends the album with an ocean of strong riffing, starry keys twinkling overhead as the percussive barge steers with confidence through storm and calm, and lightning splits the sky for one more epic Laiho/Warman battle, each showing equal ferocity. Out-fucking-standing! \n\nI realize Bodom have a reputation for flash over substance, and while that may be true to an extent, I don\u2019t see how one can snub their nose at such a heroic array of guitar work, with songs that build and build with energy, pulsing with creativity at every corner. Almost every moment of Hatebreeder is intense, exciting, and memorable. Is it teeming with depth? No, not at all, but it doesn\u2019t matter one fucking bit, so well does it utilize its strengths, and every riff, each moment, is utterly masterclass. Every single lick of this is way too epic, and when you listen to this record, it\u2019s not so big a surprise that it had such an impact. Hundreds of bands have popped up in the early 2000\u2019s and beyond that utilize the stylistic template set by Hatebreeder, and Follow the Reaper perhaps even more so, and even more have integrated this influence in more subtle ways. It\u2019s even directly spawned some more legends, like Kalmah, and to a lesser extent Ensiferum. \n\nWhether you care to admit it or not, this is bright, innovative, incredibly memorable music that has left its mark on history, for better or worse. That Bodom would sink to such decrepit lows in the span of 3 more albums was unthinkable at the time, and still rather sad, but it does nothing to diminish the quality of their classic work, among the very most fun and inspired albums I\u2019ve ever heard, out of uncounted thousands. I like Follow the Reaper just a bit more, my unchallenged favorite album from this group of hard-drinking Finns, but it\u2019s like comparing amazing sex to slightly more amazing sex. It\u2019s still amazing sex. Ok, I need to stop saying amazing sex. Goddamn it man, just go buy this album! \n\nIf you\u2019ve yet to give Bodom a fair shake because they\u2019re popular to hate on, either quit being a dick or start mooing instead of talking, so we can see what you really are. Conversely, if this is too \u2018shallow\u2019 for you, get that head out of your ass and smell the sunshine. Not everything needs to have impenetrable density and emotional weight to be enjoyable, and if it does, then it\u2019s no wonder you have no friends. But I concede. I don\u2019t wish to belittle anyone, only to guide you to one of the most kick ass albums in the world, one that helped feed my formative soul to the fire that is metal, frets aflame with skill and glistening with tasty, tasty melodies. And that driving, raucous nature is all it needs, to not only succeed, but exceed the trappings of convention and perceived limitation. Hatebreeder is immortally fun, and one of the most pleasing audible adventures available. I like it a fraction less than Follow the Reaper, and a precious few riffs fall just short of perfection, but it\u2019s still achingly cool. I will simply never get tired of this, and it spurs my spirit ablaze instantly when played, so consuming and complete that I feel akin to Johnny Storm. And you know what the craziest part is? The best is still yet to come.\n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nTime is an odd thing, inexorably tied to the changes in life. Often, these changes are jarring, leading to eventualities we would have never expected, a truth that certainly extends to the volatile career of innovative Finnish wonder boys Children of Bodom, a ride of immaculate highs and truly disheartening lows. In the beginning, though, hope was high. Though not as immediate or groundbreaking as the band would produce in their next few defining releases, Something Wild is a raucous, energetic display of classically inspired melodic death/black/power metal with a lot of heart, and it\u2019s with a sense of forlorn nostalgia that I attempt to put thoughts concerning it to pen.\n\nSomething Wild is something of an odd experiment, a conglomeration of melodic death metal circa At the Gates, classical power metal like Ynwie Malmsteen, and even miniscule black metal aesthetics in its vocal style and windy tremolo violence, sounding at times like Dissection's overly happy younger brother. Indeed, all the aspects that would make Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper count among my favorite albums in the medium are already at work here, if to slightly less powerful overall effect (though the black element was barely prominent, and disappeared rather quickly). The dynamic guitar/keyboard interplay is the star of the show, trading melodic punches in a cutting dance that was quite fresh for its time, a technique generally relegated to progressive power metal like Dream Theater. Alexi crafts some really strong riffs here, a number of them counting among the best he\u2019s ever penned, and sections like the end of In the Shadows, the roiling storm of The Nail, and the lead melody of Lake Bodom reverberate even today as some of the bands finest moments. Indeed, sections of this album are straight up mind-blowingly cool. Make no mistake, this is guitar metal, epic and furious, and it holds up remarkably well, even after 15 years.\n\nThere are a few aspects that hold Something Wild back from being on the same pedestal of immortality as its next of kin, but they\u2019re not so much faults as they are hallmarks of youth. As a band roughly and enthusiastically attempts to carve out their place in the world, a few rough edges will naturally surface. Alexi\u2019s vocals, for one, are a bit uneven. The rasp is strong and clear, but some of the lows feel out of place, especially the attempted yelling, not nearly as strong his growls, clearly below his natural range and sounding slightly forced. The recording itself also lacks polish, but to an extent I suppose this is part of its charm. Mostly, though, the songs themselves just aren\u2019t as strong as those on the follow-ups. There are some truly amazing parts, but the quality is not quite consistent enough to elevate it to classic status, and some of the individual transitions can feel a bit jarring, and the playing is just a bit too loose. However, I can hardly fault the band for failing to one-up the future, and Something Wild is immensely satisfying and impressive for a debut.\n\nThe tone, like most all of the bands work to date, is very upbeat, and even this early on, it was clear that Laiho was a very talented guitar player, well on his way to becoming one of the most unique shredders in the metal world. However, his unique and unmistakable riffing style was only in its embryonic stages, and the deepest impressions resonate from the neo-classical leads and infectious melodies, rather than the individual riffs. His interplay with keyboardist Janne Warman is not nearly as pronounced as it would invariably become, but they mesh very well, the keys acting as hovering, atmospheric support for Laiho\u2019s wild licks. Despite a few incongruous, too-basic drum pattern choices, the rhythm section also does an admirable job lending a backbone to the fray, though they too would grow given time.\n\nSomething Wild is indeed that, a fresh and interesting sound for the period, full of carousing energy and passion, virtually bereft of restraint. Oddly, this is both its undeniable charm and its main failing, lacking the concise, measured coordination of its successors, but beating them all out in terms of pure, unrestrained passion. In the end, Something Wild is fun, distinct, and rather epic at times, certainly of enough raw talent and personality to set Bodom apart from the norm. In terms of overall quality, durability, and memorability, it is not quite in the same league as the next 2 records, but it\u2019s as solid a starting point as one could ask for, and still finds it way into my rotation every once in awhile. While it has not found a place of pure immortality in my heart, I still absolutely appreciate what it has to offer, and would recommend it to anybody with a fondness for upbeat melodic metal. \n\n-Left Hand of Dog\nhttp://reaperdivision.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nThis is a prime example of how melodic/power metal should be played. Out of their entire discography, nothing can beat \"Hatebreeder\". Sure there are some Mozart rip off melodies, but overall an entirely original album. The synthesizers didn't drown out the music. The riffs are awesome! The solos too, Alexi really dominates here. It's a shame that this band has gone downhill instead of progressing as musicians. Nothing beats this old school release.\n\nThe music is filled with chord progressions, tremolo picked riffing, and leads that are mind blowing! A lot of tempo changes but nothing played too fast. I think that what stuck with me the most were the melodic overtures. Heavy Classical music oriented release. A lot of the melodies like I said were Mozart rip offs. Most of the songs here remind me a lot of the Amadeus soundtrack. Other than that, the album for the most part are original sounding melodic/power metal.\n\nWhat annoyed me the most though were the synthesizers. Even though they weren't used as much as other COB albums, I still think that they would be a better band not to have synthesizers in the music. The main reason would be because it drowns out the main rhythm guitars. That's the only beef that I have for \"Hatebreeder\" besides the Mozart rip offs. I tell you, Alexi is amazing on lead guitar. So fast and furious outputs. Scales, arpeggios, etc. It's a shame that he's gone to hell now.\n\nAll of the songs are noteworthy and definitely worth praise. I can't seem to find another metal album which shines so well as this one does. Their best album forever! Alexi's vocals are like they always are, screaming with some help from another vocalist as well as other backup vocals. But his screaming/talking fits the music perfectly. I would say that there's nothing at all wrong with the vocal outputs. They are awesome and like I said perfectly fits the music.\n\nThe production is decent. Nothing is left out here. Recording perfection! All of the vocals, synthesizers, lead/rhythm guitars, and quality were just right in sync here. Nothing is left without being heard. Maybe the bass guitar could've been a little bit louder, but nevertheless it still can be heard if you listen very closely. Other than that, sheer perfection! Again, definitely the best Children of Bodom release forever!\n\nIf you're into melodic death/power metal, then this album is a must have! It truly is a classic with musicians that show off their talent to the many listeners to these genres! Nothing went wrong here at all. Not the vocals, guitar, synthesizers, and music that is so well played out. I definite gem of a release, I don't know that many albums that this one can top. It totally rips in every aspect. Pick it up now if you haven't already! Worth the money, you won't be disappointed!\n",
        "\nBodom is one of those bands that really got me to where I am today. Back in 2003 they were practically the first band to utilize some semblance of harsh vocals that I enjoyed, and as such opened the doors for essentially the entirety of extreme metal for both me and legions of like minded kids who have surely become valuable additions to the metal scene. I realize how over the top silly they are and how utterly devoid of integrity they've become, but there will always be a warm spot in the cold, shriveled, black stalactite that once existed as my heart for this merry band of naked, drunken Finns. Ever since Are You Dead Yet? the band pretty much seemed to lay down and accept their fate as the cool thing for the stereotypical Hot Topic malldwellers, churning out uninspired and stupid(er) music at a slower pace than before. And this, 2011's Relentless Reckless Forever, stands as the band's seventh full length, and probably the one with the least hype surrounding it since their inception.\n\nBut why? For their immense popularity, it seemed strange that nobody seemed to bat an eyelash at the prospect of a new album. Was Blooddrunk really received so poorly that all the enthusiasm had been sapped out of fans? Was their steady decline over the last few albums becoming apparent even to the new fans introduced to them in the second phase of their career? For my money, I'd say it probably had something to do with the fact that their (unfortunately) trademarked silly cover song this time around was going to be Eddie Murphy's \"Party All the Time\" and that the short teaser promo for the album featured a dull chugging riff and people kickflipping flaming skateboards. Children of Bodom has become so absurdly disconnected with their original fanbase that it's almost on par with the likes of Metallica or Genesis at this point. Musically they really haven't changed significantly since the beginning, it's the same distinctive melodic death/power metal mixture they helped make popular along with Kalmah, Skyfire, Norther and the like. However, this fact doesn't change that the music just feels different somehow.\n\nPerhaps it's the spirit of the music itself. Dating waaaaay back to the Inearthed days almost twenty years ago, back when Alexi Laiho actually was a little girl instead of just a grown man who looks like one, the band was fueled on raw emotion. The music was more restrained back then, but the band was serious about its craft. Through the years, even after becoming one of the most insane and over-the-top bands to gain popularity until Dragonforce became a household name, they kept their quality of songwriting very high. Melodic power metal with bombastic keys and cartoonishly overdone leadwork, layered over a harsh, high pitched rasp belting out the most juvenile and underdeveloped lyrics imaginable. And despite the inanity of the lyric work and the complete and utter lack of restraint, the musicianship was so high, the songs so catchy, and the performance so entertaining that the flaws seemed practically nonexistent. Since those happy, happy times, the band has since started to add more and more melodeath elements to the leads and riffs, tuning down further and focusing more on chugging sections, with the once prominent keys being relegated primarily to the background. Maybe it's easier for Janne to drink while performing with these newer songs and that's why he keeps it up, despite his talent being so above and beyond the level he's been playing at lately. Relentless Reckless Forever just continues the direction they've been going.\n\nAnd after three long paragraphs I realize I'm only just now actually touching on the album at hand, and maybe it's because the history lesson is necessary because, to borrow a Walkyierian pun, history lessens. On its own, this album isn't anything special, but it isn't anything offensive either. It's just there, doing its own thing, not really bothering anybody, but when you remember where the album came from and the pedigree behind it, it's just intensely disappointing. I ragesploded really hard on Blooddrunk four years ago, but really in hindsight the album isn't anything worth getting bent out of shape about. I could blame myself for being 17 years old and stupid and overreacting to a predictably disappointing album, but in reality the album was a lame and inconsequential release from a band that used to put out some of my favorite music fairly consistently in their prime. It's basically the '90s Mercyful Fate in that regard. And that's the same problem with Relentless Reckless Forever here, there's just nothing here. It's by far the least aggressive output from the band, with the only highlights in that department being \"Shovel Knockout\" and \"Northpole Throwdown\".\n\nGood lord, I guess I should address something that anybody who read that last sentence is surely thinking about, I don't have the slightest fucking clue what kind of mushrooms these guys were on when they thought of the lyrics and song titles for this album. Lyrics were always an afterthought with Children of Bodom, with Alexi making up a majority of them on the spot in the studio. The lyrics and vocals were never the highlights nor the focus of their music, so it was one of those things I kind of let slide because the high energy melodeath/power metal was so much fun. But now that the songwriting has taken such a hefty downturn over the past seven years, I can't help but hold them accountable now. It's just... my god. Five year olds have put in more effort than this. It's just lazy and dumb. \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\", what does that even mean? \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\", we knew it was a round trip by virtue of the fact that you came back. \"Was It Worth It?\", I dunno Bodom, you tell me. Are the new fans and the money really worth your old fans and credibility? You know what? That was a silly question, credibility doesn't buy you a nice house.\n\nAs I've said a few times throughout this stream of consciousness garbling, the music isn't necessarily bad here, it's just dull. \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\" rides on a catchy melodeath riff that stands well enough on its own that I don't feel the need to lament about the lack of keys on the track, the title track possesses one of the few moments of old school Bodom in the solos, and \"Northpole Throwdown\" is a welcome hearkening back to the balls out theatrics of the first few albums that made me fall in love with the band in the first place. But with that said, I can't tell you a damn thing about \"Ugly\" or \"Not My Funeral\". The entire album is this dull, grey slab with a couple of standout moments here and there. There are a few lowlights with the primarily low melodeath riff based songs like \"Cry of the Nihilist\" and \"Was It Worth It?\", but overall the entire album tends to run into itself. The band was always at their peak when they essentially just played frantic power metal with insane leads, so when they slow it down or focus on the newer melodeath qualities like they've been so fond of doing on the last three albums, the whole thing just seems to fall apart. It's a shame too because their talent is still there, they're just entirely out of ideas at this point. Perhaps it's time to put the band on hold for a time and focus on side projects or maybe just take some time off. Go ice fishing or... sauna shopping or whatever the hell you do in Finland. Maybe they're just burnt out and they need some time to recharge, I'd certainly recommend they try.\n\nAlso the \"Party All the Time\" cover can fuck itself with dynamite. \"Funny\" covers are useless and only serve to remind old fans how vapid you've become. Knock that shit off already.\n",
        "\nAh, Children of Bodom, if there was ever a band I had conflicted feelings about. If I were caring about appearances, I would be reluctant to call myself a fan around true metal fans for fear of scrutiny and the like. It seems to me that Children of Bodom is fast becoming a band that is being held on the same pedestal of shame as acts like Slipknot, Oceano, and Whitechapel. With their last several releases, their music and image seems to be catering to mall-going teenagers and people who believe that All That Remains is the pinnacle of the metal scene. Forgive my strawmanning, would you? I have honestly never met a fan who became enamored with the band because they were exposed to material from Blooddrunk or Are You Dead Yet? Basically I\u2019m just trying to say that the first half of their career is great, and the latter half is about as consistent as a waterslide with speed bumps. Not everything from their last three albums is an abomination under god, and there are definitely a couple good songs somewhere amidst those records. \n\nSo here we are with Holiday at Lake Bodom (15 Years of Wasted Youth), a compilation of songs spanning all of their albums. The easiest way to sum this compilation up is by saying that it\u2019s pretty much a portfolio of pretty much the best the band has to offer. There are tracks that I wish had made it on there, and others that didn\u2019t; but I\u2019m positive that every other listener has that same opinion. Holiday at Lake Bodom offers twenty songs, and I thoroughly believe these twenty are enough to satisfy both long-time fans and people who have never listened to the band before.\n\nOne of the best things I can say about this compilation is that it has a pleasant lack of Children of Bodom\u2019s newer songs. What songs that made it on here from Are You Dead Yet? and beyond just happen to be some of the only ones I really like. I was happily surprised to find Shovel Knockout made on here, being that it\u2019s pretty much the only track off Reckless Relentless\u2026 Wreckless\u2026 Ruffles, whatever the fuck their last album is called; that I\u2019ll go back and listen to. I also feel I must mention that Children of Bodom\u2019s last album gets the award for have the most awkward title to say aloud in music history.\n\nUltimately, this feels like a great service to fans who want to sit down and listen to Bodom and get a taste of some of their favorite songs spanning over every album. There are also two unreleased cover songs as well, which is an additional treat. I\u2019ve never been a big fan of CoB\u2019s covers, but they\u2019re solid enough that I don\u2019t feel the urge to skip them. It feels to me like the band included them just to offer something new to fans as well, which I can definitely appreciate. As a longtime fan I really can\u2019t find anything really to complain about with this release. It\u2019s a solid 90% and the only thing in years that Children of Bodom has done that I\u2019ve been wholly pleased with. \n\nAll in all, a solid compilation that highlights everything good at Children of Bodom. If you\u2019re a long-time fan or just an occasional listener, I recommend it. If you even have a passing interest in Children of Bodom, then I recommend it.\n",
        "\nEnergetic and melodic.\n\nThe energetic and melodic guitar work and clever combination of power metal, black metal, and good old heavy metal is an excellent listening experience. In addition, the guitarist and keyboard player tend to solos in a clever way. The technicality level is very high, however the songs have simple atmospheric melodies reminiscent of the early black metal scene. Shredding and speed is used tastefully to enhance the sound. \n\nThe guitarists utilize an interesting combination of melody and brutality. The old school black metal tremolo-picked riffs and misanthropic atmosphere is combined with ear-pleasing neoclassical work. In addition to that, the keyboard player provides atmospheric melodies as well a few shredding keyboard solos. Furthermore, the rhythm guitar uses classic heavy metal riffs combined with brutal black metal and old school melodic death metal riffs. The influences from Gates of Ishtar and early In Flames are fairly obvious. For example, the title track riffs remind of the \u201cBloodred Path\u201d album by Gates of Ishtar in its tremolo picking mixed with classic heavy metal power chords and solos. The guitar riffs are simply fucking awesome and catchy as hell. This quality is the trademark for Finnish melodic death metal bands. A similar concept would be used by Insomnium and Kalmah (the melodic death metal sister bands) in their later albums (\"In The Halls of The Awaiting\" and \"The Swamplord\") Arguably, Insomnium and Kalmah have the same music spirit, but better lyrics than Children of Bodom. \n\nThe drumming and bass guitar are not overly complicated and backs up the guitars. The vocals and lyrics could be viewed as the weak point of the band. The words and the song titles are somewhat meaningless and not very intelligent at all. It seems that the band did not take the lyric writing process seriously. However, the concept is obvious: the dark imagery of brutal murders near the Bodom Lake, a place located in the band\u2019s homeland. \n\nEvery song is fairly solid, but the title track as well the album closer, \u201cDownfall\u201d, show musical perfection. Weak song titles and silly lyrics take down otherwise amazing guitar work and energetic songwriting. The album is recommended to people who love metal in general. The people who listen to Kalmah, Insomnium, In Flames, Dark Tranquility, and Gates Of Ishtar should be already familiar with Children of Bodom's work.\n",
        "\nIn the past years, I have always tried out a couple of Children Of Bodom records and came to the conclusion that the band always quite sounded the same and always included a bunch of predictable but heavily addicting party tracks on their records and some more or less convincing fillers. There were some records that I actually liked as the classic \u201cHatebreeder\u201d or the quite underrated \u201cAre You Dead Yet\u201d but I rarely listened to them as a whole and always found a couple of songs to skip. \n\nThis retrospective is now the perfect release for me. It is filled with eighteen songs from the past fifteen years spanning from the band official debut record \u201cSomething Wild\u201d up to the latest album \u201cRelentless Reckless Forever\u201d. From fast and hard melodic death metal like the amazing \u201cSilent Night, Bodom Night\u201d over catchy hit singles as \u201cHate Me!\u201d up to rather electronic experiments like the wonderful \u201cLiving Dead Beat\u201d this album includes everything I have always liked about the band. \n\nAs a special gimmick for those who already own everything the band has put out, Children Of Bodom put not only a good booklet inside but also some kind of documentary with over twenty minutes of extra footage and a brand new video clip for \u201cShovel Knockout\u201d on a bonus disc that illustrate well the band\u2019s philosophy which can be resumed on having fun without any limits and living day by day. \n\nThe two brand new cover songs also illustrate that rebellious attitude. On the other side, the two tracks prove once again that the band listens to almost all kinds of music and is able to add their band typical sound to anything. The Celtic punk classic \u201cI\u2019m Shipping Up To Boston\u201d by Dropkick Murphys has quite the same positive energy as the original and is a great party anthem. \n\n\u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d is a very catchy hymn for jealous stalkers originally interpreted by rock artist Rick Springfield. I always felt that this song could be transformed into something heaver and the Finnish legends made my dreams come true and did an excellent job on this song in times of Glee\u2019s and other stuff. They have kept the charming melodies and grooves of the original, underlined the melodies with an excellent short guitar solo and dominating keyboards and added clean as well as harsh vocals to the original sound. I always liked the way the band made their cover songs but this is definitely one of the best things Children Of Bodom have done from that kind of view and their interpretation made me discover the original again and the track stayed on my mind for hours and days.\n\nIn the end, I have finally found the perfect solution to my dilemma that consisted of adoring some particular tracks of the band but not quite their entire albums. The band included over seventy-eight minutes of music on this record and offers value for money. Every studio record of the band to date is honoured on this colourful and diversified release. The band pretty much chose their most popular tracks but also some fan favourite\u2019s songs. Of course, some people might argue that their personal highlight might not be included for whatsoever reason but in comparison to so many other lukewarm greatest hits compilations in times of Icon and Company, I don\u2019t see any essential track missing and think that the band did a quite excellent job concerning their eighteen choices for this release. The two brand new cover songs are excellent and should please to any fan of the band even though the band could have released these two tracks as a single apart for those who already own all the band\u2019s records. A brand new song or some rare bonus tracks could have been interesting but the fact that these can\u2019t be found on here only means that the old singles, Japanese album pressing or reissues keep their value and that some possible new material might soon be honoured in an appropriated way on an entirely new studio record. \n\nI must finally admit that this greatest hits release addicted me a little bit more to the band than before and makes me want to try out again their old studio records. This compilation will surely be part of my personal soundtrack for the summer. Normally, I\u2019m not a fan of best of releases at all but this one is a very well done effort and personally even my favourite Children Of Bodom record.\n",
        "\nI don't understand all the hate over this album. I really don't. When it comes to Children of Bodom, most metalheads seem to peg them as sort of like a Metallica of melodic death metal. The band whose early albums made a profound impact on the genre, but later abandoned their roots for a more mainstream sound, thus becoming more popular. So basically, what they're suffering from is the \"too many people like this band so they can't be cool\" syndrome. Well, there is no denying that Bodom's first four albums (Something Wild, Hatebreeder, Follow the Reaper, Hate Crew Deathroll) are true masterpieces and the band's strongest collection of work. That does not mean that their new material has no value though, just because the elitist douchebags remain perched on top of their high horses, feeling the need to put people down about their taste of music and crucify any band that reaches a million views on YouTube.\n\nThe first track \"Hellhounds on my Trail\" hits the ground running and sets the tone of the album effectively, as it remains pretty fast paced throughout. Alexi said during the writing process that he was feeling particularly aggressive, and boy does it show in the material. The riifs for the most part are extremely fast, yet very technical and at times, it feels like you're listening to a thrash metal album. You can hear the Slayer influence on \"Hellhounds on my Trail,\" with Alexi even doing a pretty cool chromatic tapping solo in the middle, very reminiscent of Kerry King. So clearly, the band is exploring new territories on this release. \n\nThis is by no means a bad thing however, as the music is still very well written and all of the typical Bodom elements found on previous releases are still prevalent, minus the early neoclassical influences. The catchy melodies and harmonies, the unison shouts, the mesmerizing keyboard and guitar solos from Janne and Alexi... it's all there. Jaska's drumming is excellent as always, and the band has never sounded tighter in my opinion. Whoever says Alexi Laiho is a deteriorating guitarist who wrote this album hungover probably had a little too much to drink themselves. Alexi remains a phenomenal guitarist, with Blooddrunk actually containing some of the better solos of his career. He also knows how to tone it down a bit and presents us with one of his catchiest tunes ever, in the form of another metal ballad \"Banned from Heaven,\" which is somewhat in the vein of \"Angels Don't Kill.\" The guy just shreds like a boss, end of story. Janne hasn't lost a step either, with some excellent keyboard work on display, particularly on the fifth track \"Smile Pretty for the Devil,\" a progressive track that ends with Janne and Alexi having a keyboard/guitar face-off. The two duke it back and forth, with evocative solos that demonstrate the technical prowess they are so often rightfully praised for. Yep, these guys sure know their shit.\n\nThere is one thing that I will complain about mind you, and that's the lyrics. Children of Bodom have never been known for writing quality lyrics, which is fair enough given that the clear focus is on the instruments anyways. But still, would it kill Alexi to write more meaningful lyrics than \"Watching the c*** but before I'm into worries I do better think fast. Step beyond the legs risk self-destruction one more sucker wait again.\" Like, really? As for his barking vocals, they work well for most of the album as it fits the style well, but there are times like in LoBodomy (by far the album's worst song) where it gets so irritating that you wish he'd just shut up. Fortunately, neither of these setbacks are enough to dismiss the album, as all the other areas compensate for Alexi's generic melodeath vocals.\n\nOverall, Blooddrunk establishes itself as a very good album. Not great, but good and a worthy addition to their discography. It's personally my favorite album of their last three (the other two being AYDY and RRF) and just can't understand why it is the target of so much criticism. There is no reason any metal fan should not enjoy Blooddrunk, as it is composed of all that makes a good melodic death metal album. All five musicians are at the top of their game, and we receive a solid effort from a band that continues to demonstrate growth in their sound.\n\nRecommended Tracks: Hellhounds on my Trail, Blooddrunk, Smile Pretty for the Devil, Banned From Heaven\n",
        "\nBodom is one of my favorite bands, first off. This was my first album that I bought of theirs, and it remains one of my favorites. Having listened to all of their other albums, it seems the most balanced. It combines neoclassical and melodic licks with a more death metal oriented aspect. You will find the same atmospheric quotes preceding the songs, the same flair as on the other albums, but Follow the Reaper is a definite blend of the old Bodom style and more straightforward heaviness. It is a middle of the road album, and has excellent variation between songs. \n\nEach song is unique and truly memorable. Of note are Children of Decadence, Kissing the Shadows, Northern Comfort, and Hate Me. These, to me, are the standouts of the album. It also includes such live classics as Every Time I Die, Follow the Reaper, and Mask of Sanity. These are all phenomenal tracks, but somehow lack something the others capture so well. \n\nThe guitar playing, as it is Laiho and Latvala, is out of this world. It combines heavy riffing and ethereal licks without plagiarizing Mozart or Beethoven. The guitar work is sheer brilliance with not only outstanding shredding, but impressively catchy chord progressions (see Hate Me or Northern Comfort for excellent examples of these). The keyboard harmonizes and accentuates very well, and although is not as atmospheric as Hatebreeder or Something Wild, it is still a prominent feature. Wirmens keyboardmanship is impressive as it not only compliments the guitar work, but also doesn't feel gratuitous or out of place as some of Something Wild's composition felt. Henkka is, as per usual, a steady driving force behind the acrobatics of the other instruments. Some may say it's unimaginative, but I don't find it to be so. It provides an excellent framework, although lacking the occasional solos that Hatebreeder included. The drumming is not particularly outstanding to me, but honestly I have no ear for them. They provide a similar momentum as the bass, but are not particularly noticeable. There is little variation from the blast beats that I can discern, but they are still an enjoyable part of the album. Vocals are typical Alexi with high growls and rasping. There is some grunting or deep growling, but it's not a black metal album. I admit to disliking them due to the fact that I feel they detract from the general atmosphere of the album, but are still enjoyable. Additionally, Henkka and Janne will join in, providing interesting harmonies (if they can be called that) or at the very least other voices.\n\nThe perfect way to get into Bodom. Follow the Reaper takes the elements of the previous albums, softens them with stylistic changes more related to the later work, but retains the feeling and brutality of each source.\n",
        "\nI really don't get Children Of Bodom. I honestly have no clue. I think they are talented, but their talent is apparently heading in the WRONG direction. I could never understand the praise they received from their previous albums, but I'm not reviewing those. What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is manure. Fecal matter. Whatever you call poop nowadays, this is it. Alexi and company have established themselves as the jokers of melodic death metal and will never return to their former glory, if they had any in the first place.\n\nSo let's dive right in. This album is chock full of mediocre and repetitive riffs that bring to mind Jon Schaffer (LUV U JOHN!) and vocal lines that burn like bleach in your eyes. There's a difference between melodic death and metalcore. Alexi, please use a little bit of diversity in your vocals instead of your annoying YOWS and your glass breaking screams. Save that for Ozzfest. Speaking of Alexi, I think he is one of the most overrated guitarists in the world. His solos are wank...hell, I could listen to Necrophagist all day and not be extremely bored. And the lyrics? Someone has been getting some inspiration from Phil Anselmo. I'd like to put the usual \"I don't give a flying fuck\", but I think I'll use the even more horrid \"did you think I'd let you mix it up? Give me a reason bitch, I'm gonna fuck you up\". Of course you are! You're the most popular melodic death metal band. Kudos to you guys! The thing about COB, as I've mentioned, is that they are talented as hell, but on this album they don't show it. I've listened to some songs off of Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper and they just cannot do anything to help persuade me that COB is a good band. I mean, you have a talented drummer and a great keyboardist, yet it seems to me they pulled a Necrophagist and pushed them ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK just so they could show off Alexi's \"talents\". For your information, Muhammed Suicmez is one of the most talented guitarists, yet sometimes he needs to take a breather and focus on the song STRUCTURES and the ORGANIZATION of his songs. This also applies to Alexi, except he has less talent and an even bigger ego.\n\nNevertheless, there are some shining moments of creativity in here. \"Are You Dead Yet\" is actually quite...good. I enjoyed the chorus a lot and find myself humming it from time to time. Everything works in that song: the beginning introductory riff, Alexis' not so bad \"YEARGHHHHHH\", and the keyboard lines fit well. Speaking of the keyboard, where is it? It's not as prominent in the album as I hoped it would be. I mean, it is MELODIC death metal for a reason. Besides that, this song, and for the fact that the other members are obviously much more talented than Laiho, are the only reasons why I am giving \"Are You Dead Yet\" this score. Actually, I'm feeling quite morbid, thank you very much. Haha. Good one.\n\nSo there you have it. A table top album for a table top band. I apologize for the Necrophagist comparisons. To me it was inevitable. Instead I'll end this on a good note. Stop buying COB albums. Hey, why not buy a Kalmah or Insomnium or even a Skyfire album instead? Your ears will thank you.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom has come a long way since Something Wild. For better, or worse, fans took the evolution in what ever manner they chose. I like every album, so far. I'm mixed on this one. Here's why:\n\nIt's a good idea to point out with the most noticeable aspect, the vocals. I'm not sure what happened between Blooddrunk and Relentless Reckless Forever but Laiho's vocals have changed. It's not exactly what most would thing. This wasn't a revert back to when Alexi used to sing with those black metal-esque vocals. He sounds like he's hurt his throat. Interestingly enough, I looked up some live videos from recent concerts and the vocals aren't edited to sound that way. That's how Laiho sings now, so something messed up his voice. Compare his voice and Are You Dead Yet? or Blooddrunk and you'll see a big change. If you thought he was hard to understand then, well now you'll have a harder time. In \"Northpole Throwdown\" I swore for the longest time Alexi sang the line \"Look at my titty\" (the real line is \"Look at my kingdom\", it's gotten that bad). On \"Ugly\" Alexi truly sounds odd. He sounds so scratchy and as if he had a sore throat when singing the song. The guitar makes up for the vocals and still makes it listenable. There isn't much to say than that. Alexi does provide some excellent vocals on \"Party All The Time\", but if you're like me and got it in America day-of release you got screwed a song. That song being \"Party All The Time\". Anyway, the vocals on that track are more of what I was expecting to hear from Laiho. The clean vocals are well executed and if you remember their cover of \"Rebel Yell\" then you know singing clean isn't foreign to him.\n\nNext up is the guitars. While they still have some of the similar COB-mystique we've all come to love there's still something awry in Denmark. Some of the riffs don't seem to have that perk like prior albums. Other's seem to much like fumbling, particularly the verse riff in \"Was It Worth It?\". his perk can still be found on the album so not all hope is lost. Otherwise it's almost standard of what you'd expect to hear from COB. As usual, the bass is invisible it's like Henkka T. Blacksmith, sadly I had to look up his name so he really is that invisible, wasn't there for the recording. He's so obscure that his band mates don't realize that strange guy with the weird guitar on stage with them and someone remembers who he is before security throws him off stage. He's like the sugar in a soda, he's in the mix but you don't notice, more like acknowledge, him.\n\nA note on the lyrics, there's a few oddballs in the mix. For instance, this one from the title track: : \"Back to the place where, I was told, drunken ignorance, Is pure, true gold\". The way it's written is even odd too. You'd expect this to be at least two lines not four. The final verse in the title track, the one that mentions the monkey clinging to his back his another example. Now I know COB has some strange lyrics before, but they've worked. It seems hard to believe that they actually wrote that down. At least it isn't as bad as what Metallica wrote in the film Some Kind Of Monster. those lyrics were putrid. However, not everyone is out to make a quick buck from rockumentaries and the like and we'll never see what else they could have written. I have this strong feeling that the band on;y writes after tours not on or between them and that they never write more than necessary. They aim for nine originals, except on Something Wild with it's seven original tracks, and say \"That's all for now. Let's work on guitar\". Laiho seems to assert dominance in the band as he writes the only lyrics they'll ever need. There's a few questionable lyrics in there and there's at least one per song. I'm not gonna go through them all. Check out the album to see what I mean.\n\nAn aspect to the music that is of worthy mention is Janne Warmen's keyboard playing. Most complaints I've heard was that there wasn't as many keyboard parts in the album. Well, that's an incorrect statement. The keyboard plays a major part in the verse riffs of most songs on the album. Off the top of my head I can think of many keyboard solos from this album. I usually listen to the album while writing this out but I finished it and I'm not going to go listen to it three more times while I slowly type this out. But maybe that's just a point. The album is mostly easy to forget. I'm not typically thinking of this album when I have a song stuck in my head. There isn't much to comment on about the topic of keyboards since it's more of what you'd expect again.\n\nThe production is nice and clean on the album. The band's come far enough to have it that way. There's not much to comment on about it though since all there is to say is it's nice. the drumming is also as expected on this album, well-executed.\n\nDespite accusations that this album gave the band the means to keep touring, it's not a completely terrible release they've had better. This is, in my opinion, the first time they sort of flopped on an album. It's hard to compare this to other COB albums but I'll still listen to it. It's like that redheaded child in a family of blonde, Finnish people, it sticks out. I recommend a listen if you're a fan and have been putting it off. For newcomers, however, I recommend giving the other albums a listen first, and I mean all of them and every track too. So by 2014 I expect the next release from the band. I can't wait for them to release a new album and I do hope it's better than this album. I hope it'll sound more like Hatecrew Death Roll or Are You Dead Yet?, looking at it realistically. Until then I'll see you on the reviews for that album in 2014.\n",
        "\nIf someone suggested the band Children of Bodom to you, and you searched them up, listened to \"Are You Dead Yet?\", thought it sucked, and decided never to listen to this band again, then HOLD ON! You're missing out on a lot if melodeath greatness: Hatebreeder, Follow the Reaper, and, of course, their awe-inspiring debut, Something Wild. Why is this album so great? Well, for one, they successfully mashed up four different genres: melodic death metal, power metal, neo-classical metal, and black metal. There is nothing bad about this album. The black metal element helps build a dark ambiance, something that their other albums lack. This is noticeable on tracks like Deadnight Warrior, In the Shadows, Red Light in My Eyes Pt. 1, Red Light in My Eyes, Pt. 2, Lake Bodom, The Nail, and Touch Like Angel of Death. Wait, that's the whole album! It's that good.\n\nIf you hated \"Are You Dead Yet?\" because of Alexi's vocals, then you have to listen to this. His vocals are as harsh as ever, not only his black metal-inspired screams, but the occasional \"clean\" vocals that build up the darkness. I have to say, Alexi Laiho is one of the best guitarists ever. He says that he hates this album because he tried to copy his idol, Yngwie Johann Malmsteen, but what's wrong with that? I've heard many bands that copy their idols!\n\nJaska Raatikainen's drumming is actually pretty good on this album. Instead of competing for attention on the other albums, he just does his own thing without interfering. The main reason why drummers usually compete with the guitars is because the drums usually follow along with the guitars, which doesn't make them as noticeable. Here, you can hear Jaska's drums clear as day. As for Janne's keyboards, they're AWESOME! On later albums, the keyboards aren't utilized as much. They just follow the guitars until they get a solo. Here, they're almost (wait, scratch that. They ARE) a necessity on this album. Without them, we wouldn't have as dark of an atmosphere. As for the bass, I can't hear it, so it probably follows the guitars.\n\nThis album is a must-have. Forget Hate Crew, AYDY, Blooddrunk, and RRF. Something Wild is the TRUE sound of Children of Bodom.\n",
        "\nIf you're really into live albums and think you've heard it all? You really haven't heard the best until you pop this into your stereo. Finland's deadnight warriors, Children of Bodom, have definitely made one of the best live albums to date in European metal history, it's powerful, explosive and even some of the songs featured or played live are better than the originals. This album recorded Bodom's live shows in Tokyo, Japan in 1999. The set list were songs from their first two albums \"Something Wild\" and \"Hatebreeder\", this concert was to promote their 2nd release and so on. When a band promotes music material, they want to make sure it's a good job. I'm just going to say right off the bat that it's absolutely the best Bodom had to offer.\n\nFor one thing, the songs played on this live album are actually better than the original ones! The band added some new stuff into the songs that extend them a little and in most cases it improves the piece(s) further! An example of this would be the intro to \"Touch Like An Angel of Death\" where you get all caught up in passionate emotion with those juicy melodic solos and then it drops to the morbid and dark riffs that kick the melodic shit aside and jumps right into the pure madness and destruction! This all really adds to the explosive quality of this album!\n\nThere's just something about a live album that makes it sound so much better! Everything doesn't sound exactly like the album version which kind of adds a little twist to the music, a breath of fresh air. Hell, there's even a solo battle between Laiho and Warman which sound amazing because you get a taste of both the musicians' talents and skill. It's really overwhelming in a good way, you have all this music surrounding you and it can get stuck in your head for days. This album inspired me to play live at a venue one day, I'm sure it has affected most fans the same way, if you ever have that feeling then you instantly know that this album is for you. Buy this and you get the Tokyo Warhearts experience, even if you weren't there.\n",
        "\nAs far as Children of Bodom go, this is definitely a new low for them. Honestly, this release appears to have only ever been attempted to kill that small section of time between Blooddrunk and the next release coming in 2-3 years. As this album features their customary guitar solos, albeit lacking any lyrical substance and strength at all, and if I was going to be perfectly honest, it sounds like the lyrics and vocals were an afterthought on Alexi's part. A SEVERE let down on his part and a definite let down for the listener. After all, lyrics didn't feel to be an after thought on Hate Crew Death Roll, Follow the Reaper, or Blooddrunk for that matter regardless of what you think of the album.\n\nAfter the first few listens this release really got under my skin and left a horrible mess on the way out. The lyrics were at best, shoddy. Guitarmanship (if it's not a word, it is now) is the same as it has been with with Alexi for the past 10 releases, phenomenal as a soundtrack and for that it earns points. The drumming was on par, but there's just something about Children of Bodom and the lack of lyrics that's both off putting and worrisome about their next release, especially if their systematic degradation since HCDR is anything to go by, they'll be doing guitar covers of Lady Gaga with Alexi dressing up as Freddie Mercury.\n\nThe effort's there clearly, but possibly not in the right areas to make this a decent album in relation to the time taken to produce it as the format of half the songs are pretty much the same: singing amidst solo after solo, making me wonder if they were written before the lyrics were, and then implemented in such a fashion to put emphasis on the solos. If not, why not? Because it sure as damn feels that way, especially with every song seemingly starting with a guitar solo of some sort or other, most notably Northpole Throwdown.\n\nWere this anyone else but Bodom, it wouldn't have been aired as a brilliant album, but as it's Bodom they get a positive review across the board and a pat on the shoulder, claiming they've made yet another amazing album to add to their catalog, but it's not ok! This is something of a massive failure on their part to everyone who's fervently listened to them for the past decade, or for 5-6 albums, making Blooddrunk look like an absolute masterpiece of an album, and whilst I liked Blooddrunk, it was nothing compared to Hate Crew Deathroll. They may as well have not released this album and kept their good name in my opinion.\n\nDefinitely not their best offering and if it were possible, I would listen to this album to simply claim I have, much like I'd do many things to merely claim I've done them, but this is definitely no guilty pleasure at any stretch of the imagination. That being said, Northpole Throwdown wasn't too bad, nor was Relentless Reckless Forever, but they simply weren't redeeming songs. The solos + the name earned COB above 65%, but not by much.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom's debut album lays the blueprint for all following Bodom releases up until around \"Blooddrunk\" or \"Are You Dead Yet?\" Dark keyboard melodies courtesy of Janne Wirman, skilled drumming, and Alexi Laiho's excellent vocals and guitar work combine to create a unique brand of melodic death metal that would become Children of Bodom's signature sound.\n\nThis is a sound that was influenced both by the \"Gothenburg\" sound pioneered by bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquillity. It also has a darker, more \"evil\" sounding influence, similar to black metal, along with some power metal-like influences that combine to produce a unique sound.\n\nProbably the best aspect of \"Something Wild,\" is the guitarwork, led by Alexi Laiho. It's fast, beautifully melodic, and very complex sounding. The guitarwork is different from other melodic death/power metal bands in that it is far more aggressive sounding, akin to the guitar work of death, thrash, and black metal bands. The melodies and solo's are excellent! Here is where Alexi show's off his skill as a guitar player. Every riff stands out and are all memorable and pleasing to the ear.\n\nThis guitarwork is backed up by the keyboards of Janne Wirman, and being a former pianist, having played the instrument up until high school graduation, I'm a tad bit biased towards keyboards, provided they're well done, which they most certainly are here. Wirman's keyboards add even more of a dark melody to the music, and add to the atmosphere, most notably on the opening track, \"Deadnight Warrior.\"\n\nThe drumming is good but unusual for this type of music, and like the guitars is more similar to death or thrash than melodic death metal, at times, it almost sounds somewhat tech death in nature. The music is somewhat bass heavy, at least, the bass is sufficiently audible throughout the album to the point that you know it's there, but other than that, it doesn't really do much more than give the music a deeper, richer sound.\n\nThe last thing I'll mention before shutting up is Alexi's vocals. Sometimes they're very good, similar to Anders Friden but more harsh. Other times, like on the chorus of \"Red Light in My Eyes Pt. I,\" Alexi tries going for this deep sound which isn't bad, but doesn't seem to suit his vocal style very well. Some of the people who have written reviews for this album have made comments about the production, however, I haven't found that. Either because I'm not paying enough attention, or I've finally blown my eardrums out listening to loud musc.\n\nLike every debut album, \"Something Wild\"has its flaws, but those are more than made up for by the good points on this album.\n",
        "\nSee that little name there? Children of Bodom, and if you spoke to me in real life about music, you would understand that I happen to like this band. I happen to like this band a lot, like hail their first four albums as musical masterpieces that helped me really start getting into extreme metal. I must have listened to Hatebreeder over 75 times fully through and kind of completely killed that album for myself by listening too much.\n\nHowever, the Wild Child, Alexi Laiho, and his merry band of thrashing misfits have slowly begun falling from grace since Are You Dead Yet? was released. Now, I like Are You Dead Yet? and some of the songs on there were pretty damn amazing even if some tracks fell flat. Blooddrunk, the album that this one is following up, however, was a fucking nightmare to my ears. To me, it sounded like Children of Bodom were told to make an album but literally had no material written and needed something on the fly to release. Now, I won't called Blooddrunk really all that terrible...just not any good. I mean, a few riffs and parts of songs were kinda cool, but overall it was just boring. Boring. Boring. Boring.\n\nSo now we have the follow-up Relentless Reckless Forever, which I find really obnoxious to pronounce in conversation, let alone in my head. Seriously, I keep double checking the name of the album because I keep thinking that I somehow got it wrong. Anyway, after listening to the single back in December, the preview for Was It Worth It?, I noted the great musicianship and very Hate Crew-esque sound from it.\n\nActually giving the album a few listens, and then a few more, I was quite pleased to say that it was much better than Blooddrunk, but that wasn't saying much. The thing was, I wanted so much to love this album and spit in the face of those who said that Bodom was losing it. The band is really not helping my case with these latest releases.\n\nThe album varies in the quality of the songs with several being outstanding and a few being almost completely forgettable. I know the lyrics for Shovel Knockout by heart, but at the same time can't remember the tune of the album's title track. Let it be known though, the good songs are GOOD. Now onto the actual sound itself.\n\nAlexi Laiho has been somewhat renown for his guitar work and just what he can do with those strings. I remember reading in an interview that Zakk Wylde, one of his big influential figures, showered him with praise one night during their tour together. I guess he took it to heart because a few of these songs seem to have a Black Label Society influence to them. Is that a bad thing? Not really, except if you love the technical and neoclassical melodies joined with haunting keyboards as seen in Old Bodom. Turns out that I do, but I won't criticize a band too much for wanting to try something different.\n\nIf I had to pick one of their earlier songs to best compare their new stuff to, it would be If You Want Peace... Prepare For War. We have fast, brutal tremolo-picked riffs with loud crashing drums and neat little stints with the whammy bar with pinch harmonics. Even on my favorite songs though, it feels like Janne is slowly being squeezed out of the band. Keyboards seem to be becoming quieter, hidden in the background and muffled behind the sheer power of the riffing. The keyboard solos kinda disappointed me too, sounding like Janne was just going through some scales and thinking, \"Meh, this is good enough\". Just another day at the office for him.\n\nKeyboards aside, Alexi's vocals are actually a step-up from, well, just about anything else they've done. The lyrics are still stupid and senseless, but that's what Bodom lyrics are supposed to be. Anyway, his voice seems to be a bit more refined and he dances between pitches while laying down blisteringly fast riffs. There's a bit of a change in his voice though, most notably in the first verse of Shovel Knockout that I simply can't describe. Another good point to mention is that you can kind of understand what the fuck he's singing now. Even reading along, I had trouble following the lyrics for their earlier stuff, but that problem has been amended without losing strength or throwing in awkward clean vocals. Major props to the band for this.\n\nNow for my major issue with this album. You've heard one song, you've heard them all. Besides for the three that I really liked, this album doesn't have very many memorable songs, riffs, or parts. I could list off song from all their albums that I felt were extremely memorable and stood out, but it gets harder to do here. I guess Was It Worth It? does stand out a bit, but it's a fucking four minute song that seems to drag on. I was going to rant about Was It Worth It? because it felt like a stupid attempt to milk a single out, but then I realized the same could be said for a lot of songs. It doesn't really feel fair to call it an attempt at a single, but I can't help but feel that. So instead I'll just say the song is boring, like half this album.\n\nHere's my numerical verdict:\nSound: 6/10: Ranging from awesome to completely forgettable. Bodom's musicianship is fucking brilliant, but they really need to revamp their songwriting. It feels so structured, rigorous, and lacking that dark, gritty feeling of their earlier works.\nLyrics: 3/10: Derp. That's pretty much all I have to say about it.\nMusicianship: 9/10: As mentioned above\nImpression: 6/10: I liked this album about as much as I thought would, actually. I haven't given up on Children of Bodom just yet, and these songs did prove that they still do have it (to some degree).\nOverall: A solid 6/10.\n\nFinal thought - I still proudly call myself a fan, but it's starting to look like these guys are suffering from artistic death. Maybe all they need is a change in the lineup or something? Who knows, but something needs to be changed if they ever want to live up to the former glory of Hatebreeder or Something Wild.\n\nSongs I really like:\nNot My Funeral\nShovel Knockout\nUgly\n",
        "\nThis is in my opinion the last Children of Bodom release that was still 100% good and true and metal and everything... This album is a masterpiece. This is one of the albums that actually made me want to play the guitar.\n\nThis is a great progressive power metal album. The lyrics are not as childish as on later releases, the riffs are fresh and over the top, the solo\u2019s are exquisite, the tempo is varied, you name it it\u2019s got it. Before Follow the reaper CoB released some good albums, but they sounded like some kind of angry Stratovarius spin-off. With this album their sound matured and how! The songs are well built yet surprising, and the emphasis is put on no nonsense guitar violence. It was before the bullshit-American-core-influenced songwriting they suffered from afterwards. From then on they went into a downwards spiral that resulted in today\u2019s Relentless Reckless Forever.\n\nInstant classics are Everytime I Die, Follow the Reaper, Bodom After Midnight, but that doesn\u2019t mean the other tracks are fillers. I have only one reproach, the length of the album is much too short, especially because if you bought it in 2000 like me you paid the price of a full album. 38 minutes is good for an EP, but for a full album? Not sure about this. This is also why I don\u2019t give 95 %, although the music has the required quality for such high marks.\n",
        "\nWhat do you get when you mix death metal, power metal, and neoclassical metal? Something Wild. I use that in both adjective form and the name of the album.\n\nThe guitar work on this album is phenomenal. The album is packed with all sorts of riffs and keyboard pieces. The songs jump from one awesome riff to another perfectly piecing the song together into a masterpiece. The neoclassical influence can be heard through the album as Laiho smashes his way through the leads of the album to produce exponential music. This may be some of the best guitar work around. The riffs are filled with influence and are full of pure originality. Even the simplest of riffs like those in \"Touch Like An Angel of Death\" and \"In The Shadows\" sound amazing. Classical music is used in the songs too; such as Johann Sebastian Bach, technically he's Baroque, and Mozart, who is actually Classical. The fast pace that is constantly kept will keep your headbanging even in the slower verses of \"Red Light In My Eyes, Pt. 1\". \"Deadnight Warrior\" is a great track to listen to if you only hear one song it'll be enough to give you an idea of the album's content musically. The solos on \"Something Wild\" are outstanding and some of the best solos I've heard. Both guitars know how to work together excellently. No where on this album will you find the guitars struggling for lead or contradicting one another negatively. The drums are great at complimenting the guitar without doing the same thing as the guitars as with other bands; Ex: Metallica. The keyboards are the source of the classical sounds on this album. Without Janne Wirman this album wouldn't sound half as good as it does. Children of Bodom seem to have put the keyboards in every good spot possible in every track. Alexi Laiho's vocals show evidence of black metal influence adding to the rich and varied influences of the album. It's been said that Alexi Laiho was truly inspired by the Swedish band Dissection at the time. Alexi Laiho mixes the death metal and black metal vocals well. Most black metal vocals sound like shit but this is just great. It's unique to see such skill, as far as I know this hasn't been repeated leaving these vocals almost one of a kind.\n\nThis comes to no surprise when the production is excellent for a debut. Spinefarm Records is a great record company as it is. The quality that Children of Bodom received for this album was excellent and fitting as well. This was recorded before the times were existing entitled you to good sound quality. When money was a factor in the recording in relation to record and not be acquired short-term. \n\nThe lyrics on this album are great, whether you can understand them is on you. If you ever got a look at them you'll realize they're weird. They are also very unique in this weird way. Alexi Laiho has always been a great writer and the proof can be seen early on. It may have been different when they were still Inearthed but there was definitely a masterful change in lyric writing. This is probably what causes the band to release another album three years later, but it's all time well spent and hard work worth listening to.\n\nVery rarely will I truly enjoy an album as I do with \"Something Wild\". It's a crazy, creative mad rush of pure energy pouring into your ears. It's definitely good at getting you pumped up or good \"I'm pissed the fuck off\" music unless your in that mood to listen to this album which happens to me often. I know the whole track listing by heart and in order I've heard this so many times. It's simply a great album and shows that with the right people around you can make something truly exceptional. I can't recommend one song without recommending the whole album. I do not recommend listening to just one song either. The songs are composed differently so if you find one unsatisfactory check out another; these guys don't cut and paste. I recommend this album to anyone.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom, my god are we in for a treat. Or so it seems. Relentless Reckless Forever, one of the most anticipated albums still needs a verdict: \"Was It Worth It?\" Or was it just plain \"Ugly\"? Personally, I'm still trying to decide myself. On top of that, they make the album cover look like something from a k-pop music video, well that's a real kick to the dick isn't it? Can this be Bodom's \"St. Anger?\" We shall soon see for ourselves.\n\nI feel like everything is completely different, Alexi's vocals have changed dramatically since the last album, I'm still having a hard time getting over it. It sounds like he's singing through a long plastic tube, of course I had friends of mine (who liked the album) make up shitty excuses by saying things like: \"well, he's been growling for 12 years, what did you expect?\" Bullshit, a steaming pile of it, I don't know if Bodom is trying to take another creative approach or if they have a shitty microphone production, for all we know it could be on purpose. Either get better equipment or lay off the smokes Alexi.\n\nThe songs seemed to have taken a bluesy approach in my opinion, take \"Was it Worth it?\" for example, bluesy riffs and such, that doesn't sound bad to me, but it gets to a certain point and by that point I mean when it starts to get old. Whatever happened to the band we once knew who played songs like \"Lake Bodom\" and \"Deadnight Warrior\". Now it's songs like \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\" and \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\"? Give me a fucking break, seriously.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like the album, maybe not love it, however it's worth listening to. This album isn't all cons, there's some pros, Bodom never ended up like Metallica, where everything went so shitty that it was sickening, they instead showed a good balance of melodic death metal and blues. Sure, this album could use some tweaking like getting better sound equipment, better titles and probably bring out some of their old roots. Some people even claimed to me (before I listened to the album) that it sounds like a mix of Something Wild, Hatebreeder and Are You Dead Yet? When I heard that I was all for it, but when I started listening I felt a bit disappointed, I felt that there were a lot of things missing. This just goes to show that there's a lot of room for improvement.\n",
        "\nWhenever you hear anything about this band, it's nearly always either praise for their first three albums or criticism of their last three. 'Hate Crew Deathroll' is usually left unmentioned or seen as \"the beginning of the end\" of this band's relevance in the metal world. After listening to each of Bodom's albums multiple times, I've decided that this is quite possibly my favorite for various reasons.\n\nThe single factor that propels this album a step ahead of its predecessors (except maybe 'Follow the Reaper') is the keyboard work. Janne plays many of his greatest keyboard solos throughout the album (\"Chokehold\" in particular comes to mind) and provides the keyboard melodies and atmosphere that help turn songs such as 'Angels Don't Kill\" and the title track into the Bodom classics that they remain today. Another aspect of this album that I really respect is the fact that it explores new musical territory, drawing from thrash metal, melodic death metal, power metal, and other genres to create a truly unique sound.\n\nAs always the guitar work is top notch, with Roope Latvala (ex. Stone, Sinergy) taking Alexander's place on rhythm guitar and bringing echoes of thrash metal to the band's overall sound. Alexi's solos and riffs are impressive as always, especially in tracks such as Needled 24/7 and Sixpounder. The only downside of the guitar work is that the neoclassical elements that inspired the first three Bodom albums are gone. This will greatly irritate the people who worship the first three albums for their neoclassical tendencies, but for others (myself included) who didn't want to hear a 'Follow the Reaper' or 'Hatebreeder' part II, the change of course is appreciated. Although only some of the solos on this album match up to the technical brilliance of their predecessors, Alexi is still able to play catchy and melodic solos and riffs that are varied and often memorable.\n\nIn terms of vocals, an obvious shift in both Alexi's lyrics and vocal style is evident. The lyrics on this album take a more antagonistic approach than in the past, although I don't really focus on them, as Alexi Laiho has never been a great lyricist. Also, the vocals are now much more aggressive than in the past, which some people dislike and compare to hardcore and other genres, but I actually enjoy them quite a bit. Is seems like in the past Children of Bodom had to assert their prowess as a band solely through their guitar and keyboard work, which helped draw listeners away from Alexi shouting \"Bodom after midnight! Bodom after midnight!\" and adding very little to the band's overall sound. Now his vocals add energy and an overall rebellious vibe to the songs, which I enjoy more than Alexi's more black metal influenced vocals.\n\nIn terms of bass playing and drumming, their is an obvious shift towards thrash metal both stylistically and rhythmically. Jaska uses more double bass pedaling than on previous albums and does a great job providing a foundation for the band's sound (along with Roope and Henkka), especially on tracks such as 'Bodom Beach Terror' and 'Sixpounder'.\n\nMy only complaints about this album are that the guitar solos display less virtuosity than on previous offerings and that this album propelled the band in a direction that eventually led to their decline, beginning with 'Are You Dead Yet'. Overall a very impressive release that metal fans everywhere should experience for themselves.\n",
        "\nTaken from the metal-archives page: \"Pre-orders come with an exclusive Children of Bodom wall clock.\" Uh, alright, seriously; who needs a Children of Bodom wall clock? Are there really people out there who wanted that? Next you're gonna tell me Amon Amarth is putting out an album with an action figure included. Pfft.\n\nSo, onto the review. Children of Bodom want to be this wild, uncouth band of raging maniacs, but really with this album it's the opposite: they've pretty much become a bunch of tools of the mainstream, or as close to mainstream as metal gets. Processed and manufactured anger that holds no specks of any genuine feeling at all is what you will find on their latest full length Relentless Reckless Forever. I mean, OK, this is better than their last one, but that's not very hard. Dried elephant turds were more entertaining and gratifying than their last album Blooddrunk. This one at least sounds like a real Children of Bodom album, with a near-identical production to Follow the Reaper. But really that only serves to point out how deficient the songwriting has become.\n\nAlexi's voice is a raspy, sore-throated squawk that doesn't distract, but doesn't really do much to help the music either. The riffs are distorted, groovy lumps in the background for the keyboard and guitar solos to wank all over, like a blank canvass for the world's sloppiest art student. The songs themselves are solidly constructed but boring. Most of them amount to little more than yapping over generic, over-produced modern EXTREEEEEEME DUDE metal dumb-chunk riffing for the kids who have nose piercings and think Between the Buried and Me is cool. Sure, the keyboards and leads bring the score up a bit by providing some serviceable cheesy ear candy here and there, but all these songs sound alike and the product as a whole is disposable as hell. Short musical description? Yes, but then, there simply is nothing more to say about it.\n\nI have nothing against Laiho and his band for selling out; makes sense enough to do when you have a hot formula as they did a few years ago, but that doesn't make this any better. It's pretty much just a bland distillation of everything that kids who dye their hair 5 different colors and wear jeans that probably make them infertile want to hear. And I guess infertility is a decent enough price to pay for liking this kind of shash, after all.\n",
        "\nFrom someone who owns all of their albums and still fosters a slight amount of hope for this band, the best way to describe this album is 'all over the place'. Alexi and the rest of the band have become notorious for coming up with a few good interludes, solos, choruses, and riffs, and then scattering them throughout an entire album so that while none of the songs are absolutely horrible, there are very few memorable tracks anymore. There is no other CoB album where this issue is more evident than their latest release 'Relentless Reckless Forever'. The songs on this album range from classic ('Not My Funeral') to barely listenable ('RTHAB'). \n\nWhen I first heard this album, it was near the end of 2010 when Bodom released their first single for the album 'Was It Worth It?'. I have to admit that when I first heard it, I died a little bit inside. I was convinced that the band was done for and wasn't even going to listen to the new album until I stumbled upon the leak for 'Ugly'. While the song wasn't my favorite, it at least convinced me that they still might be able to recover from the disappointments that were 'Are You Dead Yet' and 'Blooddrunk'. After listening to the rest of the album, I'm convinced that they didn't completely disappoint fans, but failed to recover as fully as many of us had hoped.\n\n'Relentless Reckless Forever' is not necessarily a bad album overall, it simply fails to employ the same consistency, technique, and engaging melodies that the first four Bodom albums all possessed. The opening track, 'Not My Funeral', demonstrates to fans that Bodom still remembers their roots and contains echoes of 'HCDR' as well as 'Follow the Reaper'. This song's riffs, chorus, interludes, and solos are all well done (the guitar solo is Alexi's best since 'HCDR'). Unfortunately, the rest of the songs on the album don't match up to the strengths of 'Not My Funeral'. 'Shovel Knockout' takes a while to get off the ground and while the keyboard solo is excellent, the guitar riffs are largely uninspired and full of chugging. 'Pussyfoot Miss Suicide', along with having the worst title, is probably the most disappointing song on the album. It contains some interesting riffs, interludes, a good chorus and decent solos, but the band seems so far removed (almost bored in fact) from the music and the song sounds so disjointed at places that CoB ruin what could have been a great song. \n\n'Was It Worth It?' is another issue that I have with this album. I understand why a lot of people hate on this song, but to be honest, most metal bands with large fan bases like Bodom want a single with mainstream accessibility. As much as I dislike this concept, I understand why it has to happen (record label, band members need to support themselves, new \"fans\", etc.). However, there are far more intelligent ways to go about doing this than Bodom's approach here. Yes, the song needs to have a strong, anthemic chorus, but it doesn't have to be this repetitive. Yes, the riffs must be simplified, but they can still be catchy (see 'Were Not Gonna Fall'). Yes, you can't pull a 'Kissing the Shadows' and spend half the song soloing, but writing shitty solos doesn't attract new fans and simply pisses off the old ones. Bodom makes all of these mistakes on this song. The chorus (while it is actually a great chorus) is far too repetitive, the verses are terrible in all regards, and the solos are possibly Bodom's all time worst.\n\nWhile 'Relentless Reckless Forever' is certainly better than the last two Bodom albums, it fails to make the comeback that some of us were hoping for. It's irritating that they can write a song like 'Not My Funeral' and then fail to live up to this level of writing on all of the other tracks. Its almost as though Alexi and the rest of the band are saying to fans: \"We still have the talent and songwriting skills that we demonstrated on our first four albums, we're just trying to appeal to two completely different groups of fans now\".\n",
        "\nThis album was the album that sparked my interest in metal. I remember hearing 'Bodom After Midnight' at a friend's house in 8th grade. I ended up buying the album, and shortly afterwards I became a metalhead.\n\nFor about two years afterwards, I was convinced that this was the greatest metal album of all time and that Alexi Laiho was the world's greatest guitarist. I still think that this is an amazing album and Alexi is certainly a capable guitarist, but not nearly to the degree that I used to.\n\nThe album opens with the a sample (a voice quoting the John Donne poem 'Death be not proud\", presumably from a movie) that provides the perfect opening to the album. The guitars are certainly the most important instrument on this album. Alexi provides outstanding leads, solos, and riffs (as usual) that are the main reason why this album is so highly regarded by many metalheads. The guitar work is technical, melodic, very catchy, and overall quite interesting to listen to. Janne Wirman (or Warman) also sets up the atmosphere of this album with various synths and is quite capable of rivaling Laiho when it comes to his abilities as a soloist. Alexander, Henkka, and Jaska provide the rhythm section needed to support such an array of flashy solos and interludes. They create a strong low end for the band's overall sound, boost the other member's efforts and help back up soloists effectively. Jaska is especially important to the overall flow of the album and the transitions throughout each song, all of which he sets up perfectly.\n\nMy personal favorite tracks on the album are Hate Me and the title track. Each of them serves as a prime example of everything that Bodom does right on this album, with the latter being quite possibly the greatest track the band has ever recorded.\n\nIn terms of it's faults, 'Follow the Reaper' only has one in my book. The only problem with the album is that, unfortunately, there is a decent amount of riff recycling throughout the album. Alexi recognizes a good riff in a song and repeats the same riff in a slightly varied form in two others. This happens occasionally and when you notice it, the album seems to lose that same quality that it had during the first few listens. Nevertheless, 'Follow the Reaper' remains a CoB classic that is certainly worthy of recognition in the metal community and that I highly recommend as well.\n",
        "\nSuccess is a funny thing\u2026in the metal world, it\u2019s the difference between holding onto your ideals or playing it safe for the sake of the masses. That\u2019s what goes through my head every time I read about this here group of one-time melodic metal masters, the same group who\u2019d degenerated into -core clad simplicity for the sake of doing so, it seems. I\u2019ll admit to having a rather sour taste in my mouth as I watched Alexi Laiho and company become lazier in the composition of each successive album post-\u201dFollow the Reaper\u201d, and all that touring can\u2019t be good for them in terms of saving face, but I guess it\u2019s not up to us listeners despite us being part of the lifeblood that keeps musical groups alive.\n\nSo after two strikes, which we know as \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d and a good portion of \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d, here\u2019s hoping that the band have the capacity to at least bunt the ball in the right direction\u2026\n\nIf this album is any indication on where CoB stand in this present day, then it\u2019s painfully obvious that their best days are behind them and aren\u2019t coming back. Success and artistic integrity are two extremes that are damned hard to go hand-in-hand with, and for what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think Alexi and company started the group for any kind of artistic reason, no matter how complicated and neo-classically intricate their first three albums were. They just want to rock. That\u2019s it, nothing more. And I\u2019m sure they like getting a few bucks thrown their way to do so. It\u2019s that old rock spirit, sadly, and like many of their forefathers the consistent, bifurcating glad-handing by way of dipshit scene kids waters it all down until the orange drink cannot be watered down no more, and to that end I try to find the best of the bad situation known as \u201cChildren of Bodom\u201d. Their latest, \u201cRelentless Reckless Forever\u201d (\u2026what?), seems to teem with that \u201cbest of\u2026\u201d notion in that, in accordance with their past few albums, it contains slightly more cohesive songs with a touch more melodic thrash added to the modern sound they\u2019d flirted with in recent years. What helps plug this little firecracker along is that each track feels like a real song rather than a handful of riffs and ideas pasted together, and, for the first time in quite a while, you can hear the keyboard lines. This helps make certain moments on the album sound less dry and more interesting, sugar-coating the increasingly-lazier riff structures and increasingly-blander solos with mere hintings of the symphonic fluff of old. Most of said structures are slightly better boilerplate nu-Bodom chunking that brand-new \u201cDownfall\u201d shirt-clad high schoolers clamor for and leave us long-in-the-tooth old timers longing for something wild to once again come bursting from the mighty corpse of Espoo like Roy the Reaper\u2019s blade, with a few notable exceptions. The thing is, these guys are/seem perfectly capable of running their fingers along their guitar necks and synth keys with skills some of us out there wish we had, and they occasionally show that ability in fleeting moments, such as the stronger likes of \u201cShovel Knockout\u201d and \u201cUgly\u201d, only to be squelched some by the more trendy sounds of \u201cNot My Funeral\u201d and \u201cWas It Worth It?\u201d to remind us that Lake Bodom is still drying up.\n\nAt the end of the day, \u201cRelentless Reckless Forever\u201d is a better offering from the one-time heir apparents to the Finnish melodic metal throne, given their new direction, but the end result is not quite as addictive or awe-striking as we know they\u2019re capable of being. Simply put, this probably won\u2019t see the light of day versus their earlier offerings. But, the way I see it, they\u2019ve yet to pull a Dimmu Borgir or Nightwish level of musical betrayal, so all you can do is bring your lips to the brim and enjoy the drink, no matter how bitter.\n",
        "\nI must admit that I am not a big fan of Children of Bodom. In my opinion, those guys are a bunch of posers and their main fan base are male teenagers that think they are rebellious and very metal while they listen to their wicked music amongst other favourites such as Avenged Sevenfold or Atreyu. The number of \"fucking fucks\" that Alexi Laiho pronounces during the band's concerts is simply silly. I remember an interview with the so called \"Wild child\" for a German magazine where he tried out several sorts of beer and got heavily drunk and told about his greatest alcoholic experiences. All those things are reason why I regard Children of Bodom as a an immature fun and poser metal band that are enjoyable from time to time but not to take seriously from an artistic point of view. \n\nBut if I take a closer look at their music, I must at least admit that the band has got some talent. The keyboards are nor overwhelming, but well chosen. The guitar solos are of a high quality and there are also some great bass lines to find from time to time. The vocal quality is not much diversified but still quite unique and memorable. The only ordinary thing about the band's sound is probably the average drum work. There is also the fact that the band has a certain style and brand and doesn't quite move away from it so that there are no reasons for any new fans to try out certain new albums. You simply love or hate Children of Bodom and their style and they won't innovate or reinvent themselves. \n\nThat's why many songs on this new record sound rather similar and repeat the usual patterns. All the songs are rather short melodic death metal tracks with some keyboards and a few great guitar solos and the lyrics are about death, hate and black humour. Of course, there is another ironic fun party cover song on the record and the reaper on a rather boring and ugly album cover. The only new thing is that there is no song with the word \"Bodom\" on this record, maybe the band has run out of ideas but maybe the wanted to feel free to do whatever they want on this album. \n\nMany songs have a few interesting elements in the beginning or in the instrumental parts but get soon lost and are not quite memorable. There is no typical sing along chorus, catchy riff or live hymn on this record. The only rather outstanding song might be \"Was it worth it?\", the first single, because of its unusual vocal parts and a mixture of progressive and aggressive sounds with some epic guitar melodies at some points. This diversity is also in the enjoyable opener \"Not my funeral\" and the quite hard but atmospheric \"Ugly\" which I would consider as album highlights. \n\nMost of the other songs have promising beginnings but turn out to be typical and ordinary songs in the key of the old works of the band. \"Shovel Knockout\" for example starts with a great dark tuned bass guitar introduction and a nice guitar riff but the tension and diversity finds an end after less than a minute. \"Roundtrip to hell and back\" is the softest song on the record and calmer than the others. The dominating keyboards do a great job and the song would have been an amazing single but it ultimately lacks of a catchy chorus or something overall memorable. \"Cry of the nihilist\" has an interesting Thrash Metal attitude and some great instrumental parts but the vocals bore to death. \n\nThere are also some rather bad songs on the record. \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\" is as stupid as the title suggests and even quite embarrassing for a hype band like Children of Bodom. \"Northpole throwdown\" is just fast and aggressive and invites you to create a wall of death during the concerts or to simply smash your head against the wall. This is modern brutality for frustrated children but of no interest for a mature metal fan. The worst track is probably the title track \"Relentless reckless forever\". I think that a title track should represent an album and be one of the stronger songs but this one is simply boring and the worst choice the band could have made. \n\nIn the end, this is an average album with three quite good, three good average and three bad songs on it plus a quite useless cover song. Old fans of the band might like the album but prefer the earlier works for sure. All the others may recognize that the band hasn't moved an inch away from their typical sound and style and may quickly loose a possible interest for the Children of Boredom. Still, the album is much better than what I first expected.\n",
        "\nI can remember the night I first heard this album. I was chilling out in a basement with some friends and a friend was spending a little too much time trying to download guitar tabs as opposed to watching NBA basketball and drinking beers with us. When we asked him what band's guitar tabs he was looking for, he responded that he was looking for Children of Bodom tabs, specifically from their album Follow the Reaper. Having never heard of the band before, I asked him to play some of the music. Years later, I finally got my hands on a copy of Follow the Reaper for my own, and found myself reliving that night all over again. \n\nFollow the Reaper is as close as you can possibly get to a perfect metal album. There is not one thing on this album that someone who is into heavy metal could not like. Perfect composition, brain crushing levels of intensity combined with with an epic atmosphere and overtone that cannot be found anywhere else along with a slew of other great things from other metal genres thrown in for extra flavor, Follow the Reaper makes a very strong argument for being considered the best metal album ever. \n\nThe one thing that strikes me about this album, even when I listen to it nowadays, is how everything is so balanced yet sounds so unrestrained, so harmonious yet so distinct, with each musician bringing a distinct element to the table that enhances the music in it's own way while perfectly complementing the other members. Right when the first guitar riffs of the title track grace your ears, you will hear what few bands (Children of Bodom or otherwise) have achieved near perfectly since. Right when you hear it, you are blown out of your chair by a set of riffs and harmonies so forceful it is like getting hit with a steel battering ram. All the while Janne Warmen's keyboards cut into like Roy's (the band's mascot) scythe cuts through flesh. Then the drums move come in, and you get the idea. Everything and everybody's role is just so perfectly executed that it works perfectly together yet stands out on it's own. There are very few albums that I can even name that do this, and Follow the Reaper does it the best out of all of them. \n\nThe guitar work on Follow the Reaper blows me away each and every time I listen to it in it's entirety, with the guitars more then capable of carrying the songs on their own. Each song is loaded with so many quality riffs it is hard to pick out which ones are the best, but the best about them is yet to come. There are so many riffs within each song that you would think this music would sound overly pretentious and be a \"wank\" fest. That is not the case. Each riff not only flows into the other, but is capable of standing on it's own and wowing the listener each time out. On top of that, the album is loaded with some of the most intense, complex, well crafted guitar harmonies between Alexi and former rhythm guitarist Alexander Kuoppala that are placed at just the proper time to enhance the mood and epic factor. I do not know how much time was given into the placement of these riffs and harmonies, but Alexi clearly got it right with the composition. The results are flawless. \n\nI normally do not give up space for a separate paragraph to the lead guitar work, but here this album deserves special treatment. No one, and I mean no one in heavy metal, doubts just how good of a lead guitar player Alexi Laiho is. His solos are ridiculously fast and while they are far from the most advanced solos theory wise (though they are far from being basic), Alexi is an example of a guitarist who's technique trumps his overall theory ability, and his technique trumps it by a long shot. Alexi's alternate picking skill is arguably among the best in the world of heavy metal lead guitar, and he combines it with some perfectly executed sweep picking, extremely precise and fine tapping, and some killer whammy bar effects that are never overused. But none of that matters if no one cares to hear a solo or hear shred bursts that stand on their own (which this album contains a lot of). Alexi's lead guitar work is composed so well in terms of theory, technique, and length of each solo that you never feel like the solos are overdone or are pretentious. Rather, you are amazed by these solos. These are the kind of solos that make you think \"Damn I wish I could play that!\". In that regard, Alexi's lead playing is truly special. \n\n\nKeyboardist Janne Warmen provides arguably the second most important element to the music on Follow the Reaper. While the music of Follow the Reaper would probably be considered okay to good if it was entirely carried by the guitars, his keyboard performances add something to the music that can be compared of when you put a super charger on an already powerful car engine. His keyboard work just makes the music that much better. Using a variety of sounds and synths that range from orchestral strings, classic piano and harpischord, to a variety of band and wave synths, his performance stands out to help make the music truly epic in every regard. Songs like the title track, Children of Decadence, Mask of Sanity, and Hate me sound just that much better with his keyboard work providing the extra ambient tone, atmosphere, and epic quality to the music. Each solo duel with Alexi is just a wowing experience, and truly a sound to behold. \n\nThe two most underrated musicians on Follow the Reaper are drummer Jaske Raatikanien and bassist Hennka Seppala. These two guys provide the necessary rhythmic foundation that gives Follow the Reaper's music an extra amount of heaviness and punch that few albums have, and pushes this album's music over the top. Jaske's drumming is top notch, cycling through numerous different beats and rhythms at a variety of different tempos throughout each and every song. He makes excellent use of his whole kit, using the double bass in a variety of ways along with his hands to create absolutely amazing rhythms. Bassist Hennka Seppala can be heard throughout the whole album, even if he simply serves to provide the extra low end between the guitars, keyboards, and drums. You do not hear him stand out much on his own aside from a bit on the title track, but that is just fine. He does his job more then adequately. \n\nThe only real issue I have this album is the lyrics, but these lyrics are really only here just for Alexi to have something to bark about. Alexi's vocal approach is done just fine on this album, though it clearly is the weak area of the album. While the vocal patterns are catchy and his growling projects out fiercely on it's own, this is not an album you listen to for the vocal performance. The lyrics for the most part, do not seem to really make sense even if they do sound reasonably coherent. For the most part, they deal with issues regarding oneself and are slightly introspective and dark. Once again though, Follow the Reaper is not an album you listen to for the lyrics or the vocal performance. Despite this, it does little to detract from the album. \n\nFollow the Reaper is without a doubt, a defining metal album and arguably the metal album of the previous decade (2000s). Each time I listen to this album, I get taken back to my friend's basement and the night we were drinking beers, watching NBA basketball, and one of our friends was downloading guitar tabs for Follow the Reaper. Plain and simple, this is as close as it gets to a perfect metal album.\n",
        "\nAaah...a new COB album...something that we always look forward to. But this time around, fans were even more anxious for the release of a new 'anticipated' masterpiece simply due to a slight glint of hope...which pretty much died after I listened to the album a few times...and by few, I mean somewhere around 50. Bodom, sadly, isnt the Bodom we knew anymore. Its like Ashes of the Wake meets Hate Crew Deathroll with a little hi to Motley Crue. I have to literally pinch myself as I solely admit that they have now become a lazy bunch of retards who just want to party and mess around with girls and then write songs about it like PUSSYFOOT MISS SUICIDE! Can't imagine how anyone can sink so low...wasn't the Britney Spears cover enough?\n\nThe song titles, to begin with, are seriously misleading. I mean to say that if you look at a song name called CRY OF THE NIHILIST, you expect some black metal-ish symphonies and atmosphere...not to forget the aggression, but instead, you get some punk riffs and out-of-place keyboards. UGLY and PUSSYFOOT MISS SUICIDE are in a way, 'better', I would say. I thought they're going to be full on pop songs, but the experience of going through it wasn't as bad as it sounds...although in totality, they ARE bad. The same goes for Was it worth it...Bodom have a strong reputation of building up amazing intros and then blowing the rest of the song into oblivion since Living Dead Beat or In your face. Seriously demeaning...\n\nOn a personal level, I thought Jaska's drumming and Alexi's lead work(strictly not riff work) were great. The attempt to make heavier riffs were quite good but ended up being way to groovy. However, I may listen to the album for the effective drumming, if at all I bother coming back to it. Even the bass sounded good and acceptable. But the biggest disappointment (and I dont believe I am about to say this) is Janne Wirman! The guy who has been saving the band all these years delivers absolutely NOTHING new. The patches that he uses seriously makes me feel that the Roland JV-2080 is a useless sound module with limited range of decent voices. His leads are not at all memorable. Same old boring scale runs and now I am starting to think he does it heartlessly. Come on! Solos are meant to have a 'soul'. Soul-O! (lol...that was bad) Although, his funky outing in Not my funeral sounded good and I enjoyed his finger-feast in Shovel Knockout and Roundtrip to hell n back. But these are going to fade out soon. Frankly, even the Roadkill Morning keysolo sounded better than all of these put together. But we can cut him some slack, surely. He deserves to under-shine after delivering continuously. But now he needs to know that he truly has to make amends. Maybe have some piano pieces or some prominent choirs like Kalmah or Nightwish...not copying them, but be a wee bit more atmospheric and enigmatic...\n\nIn a world where people are gasping to catch up with amazingly fresh technical melodeath bands like Lykathea Aflame, The Faceless and Psypheria, talented wizards like the Bodom boys stay busy trying to mesmerize the muggles. I know we shouldn't compare melodeath/thrash/punk with Technical Death Metal, but it hurts to see that COB are wasting their time and quite honestly, OUR's too. My rating is purely because I love the band to death and I DONT want them to lose more fans...I don't expect them to get back to their old sound, but at least make something that makes us feel confident saying, \"I am a huge fan of Children of Bodom.\"\n\n-Worthy listens:\nNot My Funeral, Shovel Knockout, Roundtrip to Hell & Back\n",
        "\nThere are three fanbases that piss me off. The first is ICP because clowns wielding CLEAVERS (not fucking hatchets) doesn't seem as scary they try to make it. The second is Slipknot, but who doesn't hate maggots? Finally that leaves me with Children of Bodom. I'm so tired of people writing \"COBHC\" everywhere and saying that Alexi is the best guitarist ever. I used to listen to them a lot, and some of their early album hits are really fun (especially the song, \"Mask of Sanity\" - Follow the Reaper, 2000), but overall, they are one of the most overrated bands. The fact that the members have talent is nice, but there is so much better music out there. I guess it's pre-bias, but I had low hopes for this album, especially since Blooddrunk was a total bomb.\n\nThough this album was on the bottom of my listening list, it actually didn't suck as much as I thought it would. On this album, they went back to the sound right before Are You Dead Yet? and used that to form a new sound. Ironically, it sounded a lot like Follow the Reaper with more metalcore aspects to it. Most of the songs made me either laugh (at how goofy the lyrics felt) or actually get into them. I felt myself getting lost in a few songs, especially \"Shovel Knockout\", which was arguably the most technical song they have ever done.\n\nThe guitars were mediocre for the most part focusing around moderately hard chordal structure, tremolo picking, blues-esque solos and pinch harmonics, but it was catchy, so at least you can get into it sometimes. After a while, it can get boring, but I feel that way about this band in general, so that's not stating too much. Personally, this album's song structure (for guitar) was really similar to Hate Crew Deathroll. It was nice to hear that sound again. Especially when the chords of the guitar matched the keys in the right way. It often felt like they knew what they were doing - or just sobered up for the recording sessions.\n\nSpeaking of the keys, they were fantastic. I have always thought the keyboardist in this band was the one with the most talent, and he shows it (especially in \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\"). It's really amazing to hear him be playing such a complex song while making it seem effortless. You know a keyboardist is good when he can play solos damn near as fast (if not faster) than the guitarist.\n\nI have nothing to say about Alexi's vocals or the rhythm section of this album. It was completely cut and paste from any other Children of Bodom release. I seriously think they have a soundboard of Alexi so they can get that sound EVERY. GODDAMN. TIME. Personally, other than Something Wild, I think he's sounded like he has the same sound. It gets vexing.\n\nConcluding this review is easy. I know who will like this album - Fans, people who like keyboards and people starting out on metal. It's not the greatest thing I've heard, and by far not the worst.\n",
        "\nThe inconceivable aberration known as Relentless Reckless Forever has done the previously impossible: It has made me appreciate Blooddrunk. Laiho's previous opus was lambasted upon its release for embodying a half-hearted attempt at reviving Hatebreeder-era stylings in a safe endeavor to win old fans back while preserving the newer fanbase. At the time, I agreed with the popular opinion, thinking the band couldn't sink any lower. Obviously, we were all wrong.\n\nNo, Alexi. No number of orchestra hits will make this material compelling to your original fanbase; not when the material is barely passable as a B-side of Blooddrunk or Are You Dead Yet? The last two albums suffered from a severe lack of keyboards. A controversy which was haphazardly remedied in a lethargic way here. Relentless Reckless Forever has plenty of keyboard solos and leads, none of them memorable at all. For the first time ever I can state with replete confidence that Janne is simply going through the motions, bringing nothing innovative to the table. His entire repertoire consists of tacky sounding bells/strings, badly placed orchestra hits, and heartless solos. I have never been so disappointed.\n\nBodom's rise to fame was largely dependent on their memorable melodies and catchy hooks: blistering leads and harmonies that you couldn't get out of your head for days. Now, just as in Blooddrunk, melodies often start promising then degrade into pentatonic sections which completely destroy the catchy nature of the section. This was a dilemma that has grown from a nitpick in the previous two albums to a major complication here. I would hazard a guess that the band's collective attempt to replicate American-style metal caused this corrosive paradigm shift.\n\nPositives are hard to come by, however I will say that Jaska Raatikainen has improved dramatically from his previously dull outing during the Blooddrunk sessions. The title track, sections of Shovel Knockout, and Was It Worth It? are Bodom-worthy moments just making you wish that the band stopped trying to appeal to the watered-down American audience and got back to what made them such a force during the turn of the century. Immature track titles and an overuse of irrelevant audio clips put the final nail in the coffin. I feel like I just got a Lobodomy.\n",
        "\nI don't know about anyone else, but I've almost always found the music of Finland's chosen ones Children of Bodom to be like a brief bout with drunkenness. You feel elated, almost euphoric and dizzy when first confronted with their musical prowess, but all too quickly you've come down from the cloud. Most of their albums simply have not lasted me more than an hour or two of initial enjoyment. It's the melodic death metal equivalent to Ecstasy, just not as powerful or life changing as, you know, real hard drugs. That said, there have been some exceptions in their catalog. I enjoyed and still enjoy a few tunes from 2000's Follow the Reaper, and their previous album, Blooddrunk, was a nice surprise, the Wild Child and his companions seeming to tune out a fraction of their spastic composition to write a record with some atmosphere.\n\nRelentless Reckless Forever more or less follows this same trail, but there are definitely a few stretches in the album which drag me towards disinterest. For example, I really don't enjoy Alexi Laiho's vocals for more than a few minutes. They remain brash fits of Tomas Lindberg worship that still feel like tortured teenagers, despite his evident maturation in writing and performance. It's not that they don't fit the music, but I almost wish that some of the riffs the band writes, which are often pretty damned good, were helmed by a more poignant presence. Then there is the wanking, the flurries of guitar and keyboard leads that stretch off into nowhere but self indulgence and impressing the more gullible elements in their audience who seek flair over substance. Last, but not least, the band holds on to this strange 'tough guy' album that they glossed up on records like \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" and \"Are You Dead Yet?\". We've got songs here like \"Shovel Knockout\", \"Northpole Throwdown\", and \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\" that sound like bad signature wrestling moves.\n\nBrushing all of this aside is not easy here, because the elements do occasionally interfere with the content of this album, but otherwise it's a fairly solid and engaging listen. I especially like the distinct precision they create with a lot of their riffing. For example, the interaction of the bass and flighty, taut melodies that inaugurate \"Shovel Knockout\", and then explode into a circular vortex of speeding insanity. As forced and testosterone driven as such a burst feels, there is some great music in there, and when they break out the chorus with Warmin's keys, it erupts into the same passion I enjoy in other Finnish melodeath like Kalmah or Norther. \"Cry of the Nihilist\" and \"Ugly\" are two more riff-tastic tracks I would point out, and I also enjoyed the more accessible, poppy prog/metal veneer of \"Roundtrip to Hell and Back\". Then there are a few cuts I thought were mixed bags, like \"Pussyfoot Miss Suicide\" which trips over itself with, in my opinion, a few too many things happening, or \"Relentless Reckless Forever\" itself, which has 1-2 reusable parts in an otherwise forgettable chassis.\n\nOverall, didn't care for this quite so much as its predecessor, which surprised the hell out of me despite the divisive reactions, but I would still say that Relentless Reckless Forever is good fun for those seeking to shut off their mind and dabble in the tempest of youthful energy. Children of Bodom are no longer children, but they still perform with that implied attention span, and there is really not a lot to this that will remain durable in the months to come, but there was obviously a good deal of effort put into this and some noteworthy riffs that, with better vocals and overall construction could certainly be considered brilliant. Obviously the hardcore fans of all things Bodom, who wouldn't care if the band recorded themselves chewing crackers for an hour at high speeds, will find much to praise here, but for the rest of us, there's a passing semblance of entertainment.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAt one point in my life, Children of bodom was one of my favorite bands. The epic harmonies and symphonies found within the first 4 albums captured my young musical mind. Then they decided to release Are You Dead Yet? Which in itself was a bit a of dip in quality (ok, more of a massive drop). But I wasn't prepared to write them off. Until 2008, when they decided to release the shitstain upon their discography known as Blooddrunk.\n\nWhat we start with on Blooddrunk is a couple decent songs that make you think \"Hey, maybe Are You Dead Yet? was just the bands one shit album\". I really believed for a moment that this album was going to be a return to form. The melodies were back, the darkness and emotion was back. Janne had his shining moments, giving his own contribution to the album. Yes, Hellhounds and the title track led me to believe that what we had was a decent album on the way.\n\nNow, what you actually get on Blooddrunk, once you hit Lobodomy, is a dumbed down, literally drunk version of COB. It was now, that I started to realize how uninspired this album sounds. Gone are the classical symphonies and amazing solos backed by keys that gave you chills. Instead, you are given an onslought of melodies that sound like Alexi wrote (while hungover), in a much more thrashy way than they normally would. Yes, the album is faster and heavier than most of their other albums. But the problem is not found within the heaviness. It's the fact that after the first 2 songs, the album tends to verge on uninspired filler.\n\nOnto the individual performances... Alexi, the star of the band undoubtedly, has never been the most original soloist ever. His style, as you probably know, mixes the classical vibes of Yngwie Malmsteen and the shred of Randy Rhodes. This has worked for Laiho in the past, but many of the solos on here don't for whatever reason. The solos feel bored. They don't come out and punch me in the face, nor do they bring me to tears like they once could. Roope gives his share on the album too. And actually, he seems to have the better solos on the album (in my opinion). Janne's keys are bland and at times cheesy. Jaska has turned into a thrash drummer (make of that what you will). And finally, Henka, whom I'm sorry to if I spelled his name wrong, is so lost within the mix that I can hardly tell he's on the album aside from Smile Pretty for the Devil.\n\nAll in all, you're probably asking what I've told you about this album besides that it's a generic, uninspired piece of garbage. Well, I'm not sure how to explain it to you any better than that. Picture Children of Bodom writing the same riffs they wrote on Hate Crew Deathroll, except smashed and the riffs they're writing resemble something inbetween Seasons In the Abyss and Slaughter of the Soul (two otherwise good albums).\n\nSo finally, asking myself \"Why are you writing this review? For one of the worst albums in your collection? 2 and a half years after its release?\". Well, I guess the arrival of their new album has stirred up the bleak hope of a good album from the band that used to blow me away upon every listen. And I guess that I just want you, the reader, to stay away from this horseshit. Stay away from the immature, bland, wannabe melodeath album known as Blooddrunk. The 20% is being generous, considering I'm giving 2 out of the 10 songs, including that godawful cover, a good rating.\n\nRecommended Songs: Hellhounds On My Trail, Blooddrunk\n",
        "\nOver the past 5 years or so, there has been a lot of bickering about how Bodom changed their sound and consequently are no longer 'the band to watch out for', but as a die-hard fan, I can only look at their work with an eye for positive aspects. Although, I do agree that their work till Follow the Reaper was drop-dead-perfect, I still am open-minded enough to accept what they have tried to do.\n\nHellhounds on my Trail is a really good album-opener with the traditional 'Orch-hit' sound that Janne has been throwing at us for over a decade. The pace of the song really gets you nodding your head in sync with the blastbeats. Jaska's double bass has a lot more thump to this time, rather than just being 'tatata...tatata...' Alexi's vocals are nearly the same as that in Are you Dead Yet, but who cares if he sounds pissed enough to pump you up as well too. The riffing remains basic throughout, with a really catchy chorus section and a later coming breakdown where the synths join in to add that extra 'umphh'. The solos in this song are rather thrashy(reminded me a lot of Slayer) and even Janne does a really quick shred to commence the headbanging part of the song, which was great, but sounded too much in the vein of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. If you are aware of what Bodom's 'real' sound was, this might be a wafting surprise as to why they went so out of line...but well, as the song ends and proceeds to the next one, the listener can only wish, 'I hope they don't do this again.'\n\nYou know what? They do! Blooddrunk, the next song(the title track) has a really good triplet intro from Janne which is replicated on the guitar. BUT...the rest of the song is almost unquestionably like a Lamb of God song...and there even seems to be a small spoken sentence by Randy Blythe(or a reallllllly drunk Alexi.) The influence is obvious. But the solos are really catchy. Janne uses progressive scales to give variations to his leads and even Alexi does a breathtaking follow-up. But thats all this song has to offer. Hell, if it had not been for that intro or this solo, I would not have bothered to listened to it ever again.\n\nLobodomy is probably a saver. If it not had been for this song, the listener would literally have had tears in his eyes. The intro is a Jaska show-boat as he pulls of a cool roll and an infectious double bass extravaganza which is a real treat to the ears. Keyboards lay back to provide atmosphere with choir-strings. Alexi and Roope keep the riffing almost negligible. 'Bodom can do way more than this!', is only what one can think. Before the solo, there's a 'Dont stop at the top' inspired bridge section, and Alexi thought nobody would notice. But its all right since the solos that come later on are really catchy and weirdly, singable as well. Alexi's vocals are a bit weaker, but still somehow have that punch.\n\nOne day you will cry...hmmm, not really. This one has a Terminator-2 / Robocop type of intro to it. But is really catchy and gets the song going on. The keyboards do more than just sit back in this one, but there is a really unnecessary techno-fizz at around 1:26 which is highly annoying! What is wrong with you Janne Wir, man?\nBut, the solos come to the rescue once again. Alexi plays a tasteful scale-run before handing over to Janne, who for the first time, does a chinese-inspired thing in between his finger-feast. Odd, but loved it. The soloing and leadwork is longer and better and that's the best part about this song. The album almost comes back to life.\n\nSmile Pretty for the Devil has that bass-intro thingy that was, I guess, last heard in the song, Warheart. The keyboards are slightly eerie with the orchestral strings bought in. The riffing improves in this one. Alexi does some finger-flexing on the frets, surely. This song has a unique aggression to it...as though ordering the listener to stay put with the ear-phones. The chorus of this song is brilliantly composed. The keysolo is a wee-bit funny affair, but still retains my respect for Wirman's magical abilities. Alexi takes over and plays a neat one with a palpable sweep. The outro of this song has Janne playing a riff with his lead sound before he ends it with a C-note.\n\nNow, this is what I am talking about. Tie my Rope starts off with a really bad roller-spin sound blaring out of the Roland JV-2080 sound module. Its not incorrigibly bad, but its not the Bodom we want. Throughout the song, you will find elements of American thrash, which is hard to ignore. The interlude is a nice Jimme-dee tone put into good use by Janne, who later on pulls up a complex solo to give way to Alexi's 80's inspired shred feast. The chorus in this song is the best one in the whole album. Including the lyrics, which are by far the best.\n\nDone with Everything, Die for nothing isnt a really song you may want to come back to listen to. The song kickstarts with a lightning fast lick that Alexi plays expertly. A slow riff, a rather catchy one, keeps true the whole song. During the solo, all three speedsters join in to shred the hell out of their instruments. A good song, but a rather gloomy one. Not interesting, that much.\n\nAah, Banned from Heaven is the soft-ballad thing which these guys love to do ever since that Angel's don't kill megahit. All in all, I like this song only because the chords used are my favorites. Nice scale changes and slow-downs make this song a cool listen. The breakdown is similar to the one in HATE ME! Janne does know how to make catchy stuff. Alexi and Roope both play a wonderful solo each which gives this song the strength it needs, quality wise. By the time it ends, its almost gives you a worn-out, out of the desert feel...\n\n...but Roadkill Morning, wakes you up!!! You can flex your muscles with this one as it has a very nice tempo to it. You may come across a highly groovy riff somewhere in the middle followed by a beautifully ambient keyboard chorus. Alexi's vocals are really fierce and distorted like his guitar work. But the highlight of this song is the soloing, as always. Alexi starts off with a bang and Janne continues the speedrun with an extremely melodic choice of notes. The song resumes the chorus section and ends with what appears to be a camera click.\n\nI dont want to be over critical with Bodom's work, cuz when I want to have melody and thrash sewn together, i listen to Bloodrunk. Its an improvement over Are You Dead Yet, all right...but they can do without those fake, radio-ish vocal sentences, the irritating techno-sounds and the overly distorted guitar. Some more amount of arpeggios, more keyboard-guitar duels and some European sounding melodies and the classical influence will truly bring back Bodom. They can keep the drumming and bass work the same...i thought it was the best ever Bodom could concieve. Thanks for reading.\n\nBest songs : Roadkill Morning, Lobodomy, Tie My Rope.\n\n\nHail COB! \\m/\n",
        "\nAgainst all better judgment, including my own skepticism towards their genre, I like Children Of Bodom. The principle reason for this odd attraction lay in the sort of blackened power metal aesthetic that they have going on, employing elements as mutually exclusive as Yngwie Malmsteen and Enslaved, save perhaps their shared Nordic origin and love of formal complexity. Combined with a less orthodox musical reaction to the established Gothenburg sound, there is a unique charm that set COB apart from the army of Swedish and Finnish imitators of Dark Tranquility, which would come to influence the likes of Skyfire and Kalmah as well. \n\n\u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d is a contentious album in light of this, as it is the first album where this winning formula started to fall away. The principle culprit in this is Alexi\u2019s vocal display, which has allowed some of the worst elements of NYHC to slip in, and result in a sound that is often comparable to the recently birthed metalcore scene. In the otherwise excellent opening song \u201cNeedled 24/7\u201d, traces of what makes Matt Heafy\u2019s vocals so displeasing are on full display, be it the weakened bastard child of Mustaine and Hetfield growl, along with a few gimpy screamo moments that would make Dani Filth sound like Lord Worm. Bits and pieces of this deeply flawed form of extreme vocal style are littered in various sections of most of the songs on here, along side Laiho\u2019s more orthodox brand of toneless growls.\n\nNaturally a few lone offensive vocal moments don\u2019t destroy an album, but there is also a slight tilt towards a more mainstream, groove based metal evident in the musical display. Slower songs such as \u201cSixpounder\u201d and \u201cAngels Don\u2019t Kill\u201d possess a few token sections where the riff work bears resemblance to something Fear Factory might have messed with about 8 years prior, although the melodic contours and keyboard drenched atmosphere is still pretty well in line with Bodom\u2019s characteristic sound. \u201cAngels Don\u2019t Kill\u201d is actually among the more distinctive songs on here, as its Middle Eastern thematic material and dark atmosphere set it apart from anything else the band has ever done, in spite of the occasionally grating vocal moment. \n\nStylistic changes aside, there is still a solid collection of songs on here that retain enough of the traditional blend of melodic hooks, sepulchral shrieks and technical masterwork to please the die hard fan of \u201cHatebreeder\u201d and \u201cFollow The Reaper\u201d. The blistering thrasher with extra madness in the vain of Annihilator \u201cYou\u2019re Better Of Dead\u201d and the slower epic anthem with a few old school Motorhead meets Judas Priest moments \u201cBodom Beach Terror\u201d are sure to please the rank and file of Bodom\u2019s \u201897-\u201801 crowd. The rougher, Destruction inspired title song with the occasional Anthrax inspired gang chorus is also high on the priority list. But against all better judgment and my own misgivings about Laiho\u2019s vocal evolution, I keep coming back to \u201cNeedled 24/7\u201d for its masterful blend of riff happy power metal and that explosive chorus section. It\u2019s literally one of those cases where the music will force you to tune out the negative parts of the vocal performance.\n\nPhrases like \u201cmild letdown\u201d or \u201cslight bump in the road\u201d might fit here had this fine Finnish testament to melodeath taken a different road after this, but when considering where things went after this, \u201cforeshadowing a downfall\u201d is a more appropriate sentiment. There are many peaks and few valleys to be found here musically, but it\u2019s at the highest part of the crest where the trough looks the most threatening, and it is very visible when considering where the previous albums were characteristically speaking. Nevertheless, this somewhat flawed album is still quite enjoyable and should be owned by anyone who wants extra consonant sprinkles on their melodic death sundae.\n",
        "\nI never understood what all the rage about Children of Bodom was. Never. Shitty vox, generic riffs, and out-of-place keyboards--that sums up about every single CoB song I've ever heard. I just decided to review this one in particular because I knew its name (I had it on a compilation CD) and it happened to be a single. Please to note, I don't hate keyboards in my music. In fact, I love keyboards. But they serve no purpose in this band whatsoever. They totally clash with the shitty shrieking vocals, and make the music lamer than it already is. Hey, Bodom, here's a hint--- leave the keyboards to real power metal bands. \n\nYes, you heard me. CoB isn't real power metal. To me, power metal is upbeat and full of catchy choruses presented to us by a singer with, you know... POWER in his voice! Not a frog in his voice like this asshat Alexi Laiho! But hey, at least Laiho is... good at guitar solos. He can't come up with a riff worth a shit, but he can certainly shred, and that's probably the only reason I gave this any points at all. There are plenty of trade-off solos between the guitars and keyboards which is about the only thing reminiscent of power metal in this band, but by the time they get to them, Laiho's earbleed-inducing vocals make me not give a shit anymore. Plus, it just sounds so weird to hear these fluffy keys after wannabe-badass vocals. And I'm talking a Power Quest level of fluffy keys. \n\nWhat the fuck is the guy behind the drumkit doing? Is there even a guy behind the drumkit? The drums on this song sound like a damn machine! Not like one of those kickass ones used to do Meshuggah's \"War,\" I mean like a drum machine left behind from the 80s. There's no life to them, and they keep this lame hard rock beat the whole song with absolutely nothing interesting added. At least other death metal bands have br00tal drumming! But the drums can be heard; the same cannot be said for the bass. Well, I suppose non-existent bass is reminiscent of power metal, too... But still, fuck you, modern metal, and your shitty \"loudness war,\" too. \n\nSo yeah, I think CoB embodies all that is wrong with metal today. I encourage people to try and convince me otherwise, but I think Wintersun is the only good melodic death metal band ever. These guys suck, In Flames sucks, and they're both the two heavy-hitters in the genre! I don't even wanna know how bad other melo-death bands sound! To me, the genre is just doomed, and has been from the start. CoB certainly aren't helping any, especially with tripe like this single.\n",
        "\nWith so many cover songs throughout Bodom's career, there are a lot of you who just WISH for all of them to be in one, accessible place. Well, not really, but I'm sure that was what Bodom were thinking when they made this. That, or they're just looking for some extra cash. Regardless, this release is a collection of all the cover songs Bodom has done in their career as well as four new unreleased ones.\n\nAs for the standard of Bodom's covers, they are really all over the place. Some, like Oops I did it Again, are just there as a joke. Others are really good, such as Bed of Nails and Rebel Yell and others are just plain terrible, such as Aces High and Just In Case. Bodom generally have a sort of feel to their covers, with more distorted guitars (obviously) and a larger range of vocal styles (such as the case where he actually sings on Rebel Yell). \n\nWhile there are a few covers I think really don't have the classic Bodom sound, such as Mass Hypnosis, the overall standard of this release is high. This is more of a collectors item than a must-have release for you buyers out there, and it is a good collection of all the songs. For this, I applaud them. As for the quality of the songs: There is something for everyone in this compilation, regardless of favourite genre's or bands.\n",
        "\nHere we have an EP promoting the Blooddrunk album, and this is probably the best EP they have done as of late. It contains an edited version of Hellhound on my Trail, as well as 2 cover songs and 3 live songs. As a bonus, they add an uncensored video for the Hellhound on my Trail song.\n\nThe edited version is not really any different to the album version, besides being a bit shorter. The song is very good. The drumming is relentless as it is a very fast song. Alexi's voice is as good as ever and dominates this song. The guitar work on this particular song is insane. Thrashy sort of riffs that don't rest. The solo is incredibly fast and fun to listen to. Some of the old group shouts that Bodom used to do a lot are back in this song for the chorus, too. \n\nThe next song is an Alice Cooper cover, Bed of Nails. This is definitely my favourite cover that Bodom has ever done, but this may be because I actually like the original a lot. I sometimes actually enjoy this version more. Alexi's vocals are a bit off in the verses but this really isn't meant to be taken seriously. Its a great song, a great cover, and just makes you sing along. The second cover just plain annoys me. It is the song, Just Dropped In, originally by Kenny Rogers. There is really nothing interesting about this song, besides some of the guitar parts. Most boring part of the album. \n\nThe live songs are in good quality, and they are very accurate. The energy is great and the song choices are very well done. I'm not much of a live audio listener, so I can't really say that much positively about these songs. The songs are In Your Face, Hate Me! and Angels Dont Kill. Overall, this is a great EP promoting the album, and probably the most enjoyable one from the last two albums. Recommended if you do not like Bodom's earlier stuff, and want to give Bodom another chance.\n",
        "\n\u201cPride goeth before the fall\u201d, as a poet who didn\u2019t even know it once said. It\u2019s eventual with any and all group that\u2019s had more than their fair share of years and releases under their belts; sometime in their storied or celebrated career the group in question will put out a stinker of an album, one that will either be seen as a temporary stumbling block or the catalyst for the rest of that band\u2019s existence. And while there can still be plenty to enjoy in the \u201cLoad\u201ds and the \u201cStomp 442\u201ds of the world, one cannot help but almost feel a twinge of betrayal at what would seem to be the band\u2019s compositional laziness or desire for simplification should it mean their shirts ending up at Hot Topic.\n\nAll this comes into play with this here album\u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve heard it all before from both fellow reviewers and online troublemakers\u2026COB storming the scene with three incredible albums before playing it safe with the enjoyable-but-rather-sterile \u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d. But once the listening public was able to partake in the first single of this new work, namely \u201cTrashed, Lost, and Strungout\u201d, something seemed wrong on the oncoming horizon. That old BODOM spirit was there, but choppy, metalcore riffs and vocal work, as well as the truncation of the keyboards (one of their biggest selling points) left quite the bitter taste in the mouths of listeners the world over. But all that couldn\u2019t compare to this sugar-coated train wreck. All the bad aspects the single possessed are in full swing here, but made all the more easily digestible and acceptable, seemingly shooting for an audience that wouldn\u2019t have the patience or understanding for something like \u201cRed Light in my Eyes\u201d (BOTH parts). Essentially this is a CHILDREN OF BODOM album in name only, where even the smallest splinters of the group\u2019s tried-and-true, neo-classical blackened roots are cast aside for an industrial/core miasma of simplicity that showcases a band phoning it all in. The songs sound like they were written as an afterthought, just slapped together mere days before the group were to enter the studio. And the overall performance isn\u2019t even great enough to compensate for the lack of good ideas; the aforementioned choppy guitars, underscored keyboard noodlings, dance-beat drum work and Alexi\u2019s increasingly weakening vocals come together almost like a bunch of kids, well meaning but as talentless as Megan Fox, forming a band after a steady diet of KILLSWITCH ENGAGE, with this being their first batch of songs. Sure, this would work rather well for a first-formed garage act, but for these guys this is more than a mere setback\u2026this almost sounds like the band doesn\u2019t care, or worse, they\u2019re laughing at you, thumbing their nose at their long-time fans, they who have spent hours on end defending them against the onslaught of negative Internet feedback. Or maybe I\u2019m just a bit more bitter than I let on\u2026I honestly gave this album a serious try, and another, and another, but after all these years and all their emotionless touring I can no longer give this an A for effort. As a result, such a self-serving sensation seems present with the likes of \u201cIf You Want Peace\u2026Prepare for War\u201d, \u201cIn Your Face\u201d and \u201cNext in Line\u201d (a rather weak-kneed attempt at seeking out their roots), one that I just cannot ignore any longer. Congratulations, guys, you done conned me good.\n\nAll in all I was very disappointed with this, even after my already open mind tried to embrace it. I\u2019m not one to say that these guys shouldn\u2019t do anything new and exciting, but \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d is FAR from new and exciting. It\u2019s quite the deep hole to dig out of, so here\u2019s hoping these guys will come to their senses soon enough.\n",
        "\nThe stupid thing about this release is that they don't release it WITH the official DVD. The DVD of this concert is amazing, the general atmosphere as well as the stage show is just brilliant. Releasing a separate audio version? Whose idea was this? The audio is just not the same.\n\nThere are no songs on the live DVD that SOUND better than they do on record. The whole energy and stage performance is what makes Bodom's shows so enjoyable, and obviously, this CD completely lacks that. None of the songs are performed bad or anything like that, its just that, unless you are blind or something, you will not find any enjoyment out of owning this CD. But then again, if you are blind then you aren't reading this, in which case, my point still stands that this was a stupid thing to release.\n\nThe solo's are great, the vocals are accurate and the Clash of the Booze Brothers solo battle is exceptional, but the whole idea of this CD is just pointless. There may be somone out there who would prefer to just hear the live version than watch AND hear the live version, but I doubt it. This was a stupid thing to release and you should not waste your money on this unless you are an anal collector. Great DVD, terrible idea of a CD.\n",
        "\nA couple of days before the release of the Skeletons in the Closet compilation album, Spinefarm decided to be mean, and release an online teaser of 3 songs that would appear on the compilation. The songs shown were Aces High (Iron Maiden cover), War Inside My Head (Suicidal Tendencies cover) and Mass Hypnosis (Sepultura cover).\n\nThe Aces High cover is atrocious, in my humble opinion. The vocals are beyond annoying on this particular song, and the riffs have been made worse with the tone they used. The band took a risk by covering a song by the famous Maiden, and they failed. The War Inside my Head cover is probably the best of these three songs. I don't like the band that this song is covered from, but I can't help midly enjoying this cover version. Its upbeat and catchy, and does the original justice.\n\nThe Mass Hypnosis cover seems off. I don't know if the mixing was a problem, but the vocals are weak. With this song, Bodom sort of removed their influence for the sake of covering this song. I hear no traditional Bodom in this sound which is very unfortunate as I love the original and I generally enjoy Bodom's interpretation of the songs. Besides the slight mixing problem, this isn't a bad song. \n\nOverall, at this point in time, the Skeletons in the Closet compilation did not look very promising and overall, very pointless. In my opinion, the whole compilation album was a stupid idea, however, there are a couple of good songs spread out over the album and its a good album to pick up if you want all of Bodom's covers in one place.\n\nAs for this teaser...blugh.\n",
        "\nSo, after a considerable amount of time playing music, it is pretty obligatory that a band does a compilation album and Children of Bodom is no different. Unlike a lot of other compilations where bands simply put the most 'friendly' songs on, this compilation album really does contain some of the best.\n\nWe start off with a previously unreleased cover of Billy Idol's Rebel Yell. This is one of the only songs Alexi has clean vocals on, and he does the job quite well. This is probably one of my favourite covers that Children of Bodom has ever done, as they really do the original justice. After this we get a couple of songs off the Something Wild album. In The Shadows, which is one of CoB's best early era songs in my opinion, and Lake Bodom, which is a classic among Bodom fans. \n\nFrom the Hatebreeder album, we get the songs Warheart, Silent Night Bodom Night, Towards Dead End and Children of Bodom. We also get 6 songs from the Follow the Reaper album. Follow the Reaper, Bodom after Midnight, Everytime I Die, Mask of Sanity, Hate Me and Kissing the Shadows. As well as all these classics, we also get treated to 4 live versions of the songs Deadnight Warrior, Hatebreeder, Touch Like Angel of Death and Downfall. These songs are performed accurately and with an energetic atmosphere. \n\nFor all those unfamiliar with Children of Bodom, they play a mixed style of melodic death metal with faint influences of power metal. They started with a more neoclassical sound which is shown best on this compilation, and gradually move into a more melodic death/core sort of sound as their career progresses. Their singer is a screamer, the solo's are relentless and the songwriting is great, especially on the earlier albums.\n\nFor somone new to this band, this compilation album is a great place to start. It has all the best moments from Bodom's first 3 albums (par Children of Decadence), and a lot of cool bonus's. Recommended for someone new to the band.\n",
        "\nSingles are a taxing venture, no matter who you are. Usually reserved for the more \"accessible\" tunes (read: \"radio friendly\"), most singles I've come across only gives a mere fraction of an album's potential, made all the more strange when you get the album and notice plentiful songs that have much more focus and a better identity than the sampler track provided. And as I look back on CHILDREN OF BODOM's discography, that seems to be the case post-\"Hate Crew Deathroll\"; once they began their daliance with simplicity, the singles that would prove to be the the taste-test weren't of as high a caliber as those made in the past.\n\n'cept for this.\n\nWhen it comes to the \"Blooddrunk\" album, there are plenty oft hits and misses depending on the songs and general take on it. At least this time around, COB release, as their second official single off the album, one of the better songs (better than the first). This here \"Smile Pretty for the Devil\" track showcases a more refined and angry BODOM, one that was sadly missing in \"Hate Crew\" and \"Are You Dead Yet?\", where heaviness is king and a satisfying slab of beefy metaldom comes into play. While the guitars had started to take center stage in the overall arrangements these days to varying degrees of success, it seems to work this time around, as the riffs are thick, intense, and at times mesmerizing (the interplay between the two lead guitars and the bass near the end of the song after the second chorus comes into play). As well, the keyboard arrangements show a bit more energy and intensity all their own, something that most of the tracks off the new album don't seem to cater to. And when they all come together, including the punchy drumwork and Alexi's still-strong-at-times snarls, the product is a damn fine example of BODOM-esque metal that doesn't come close to emulating the finer days gone by but still proves that they can have what it takes to knock 'em dead even with a very skin-and-bones approach. The version I have didn't have the cover, so I'm not sure what to expect...some of their cover material is decent and fun, others are unnecessary, so I really hope it's not the latter.\n\nIn the end this is a fine example of what one could expect \"Blooddrunk\" to sound like, on the off chance they don't have the album yet. Can't say I'd know first-hand what a better representative would be, so this will have definitely have to do.\n",
        "\nThis single is good, and thats pretty much it. Trashed, Lost and Strungout is probably my favourite song on the Are You Dead Yet album, so I'm glad they made it into a single. The cover song covers a band I've never even heard of, so I'm judging it based on the sound, and not how well Bodom covered it. \n\nTrashed, Lost and Strungout is an intense piece of music and has everything a Bodom fan would want (Unless said Bodom fan wants Bodom to return to Something Wild styled music). Its fast, catchy, melodic and full of awesome riffs. The guitars really do go all out in this song, solo's all over the place, and insane rhythm timing. I really do admire the talent of the guitarists. The keyboardist gets his little solo like always and he uses his short solo time well. This was a good preview of what the Are You Dead Yet album would be like.\n\nNow for the cover. It is definitely a fun song. I enjoy the covers these guys pull out simply because they're never that serious. The riffs are upbeat, and just fun to listen to. The song has a very poppy sort of metal sound going on and is good for listening to when you're in the mood for a not-so-serious time. Good B-Side to a good single. Good is what this single is. \n\nThat is all.\n",
        "\nWell, where do I start with this...Lets just say that this single wins the reward for most pointless release ever. Not only does it only have one song, it is a song readily found on their 'Blooddrunk' album. Some versions come with a cover of the song, Talk Dirty to Me, by Poison, but even that is available on their Skeletons in the Closet album. This single contains absolutely no little bonus's or anything. Oh well, to the actual music. \n\nAs far as Children of Bodom goes, Smile Pretty for the Devil is a pretty average song. There are probably about 5 songs on the Blooddrunk album that I would make a single over this, but alas, I am not in control. There is really nothing special about this song. The chorus lick is decent, but not memorable, and the other riffs are just standard late-era bodom riffs. The drumming is relentless and Alexi still has that voice we all know and love. Those are probably the only good points of the song besides the solo. The solo is probably the best part of the song but is completely unmemorable. \n\nThere isn't too much you can say about one song releases, but yeah, don't buy this single unless you are intent on owning all of Bodom's releases, and if you are new to the band, start somewhere else, preferrably earlier in their career. POINTLESS!\n",
        "\nWith Follow the Reaper, Children of Bodom had reached an obvious peak of their career, churning out an album so loaded with neo-classical brilliance counter pointed by their more extreme metal tendencies, an album that had \u201cfan favorite\u201d written all over it. Then came Hate Crew Deathroll, and a few drastic changes in the trademark Bodom sound. Many people responded less than favorably, labeling this release as the beginning of the band\u2019s downfall, and a definite change for the worse. I\u2019m here to tell you that despite what you\u2019ve heard from its detractors, this is still a choice cut of CoB and a rather underrated (or at least it feels like it is to me) album.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the main focus of every album these guys have put out: the guitars. HCD marked a significant turn towards heavier, chugging guitar rhythms as opposed to the pure, blinding speed of the past. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that the slight groove element did come into play far too much on the altogether uninspiring follow-up \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d, but on HCD, the lower-end rhythms simply add a more dynamic balance to an already well-rounded sound. And for those of you who remain (like me) utterly infatuated with Bodom\u2019s neo-classical side, don\u2019t fret one bit. Just listen to the lead in Sixpounder at 2:12 (cued in by Alexi\u2019s scream of \u201cLoad the Sixpounder!!!!\u201d for which I am named on this site) and tell me Yngwie wouldn\u2019t be proud! \n\nJanne Warman, as always, adds his own texture and melody to every song with his keyboard prowess, though his role has been noticeably diminished since Follow the Reaper to coincide with Bodom\u2019s new, thrashier approach. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing in my books however, as I found the constant keyboard wankery to be a little much at times (though make no mistake, he and Alexi\u2019s jaw-dropping duels and harmonies still make it in at the right times).\n\nAs always, CoB\u2019s rhythm section never falters or fails to impress. Jaska provides a rock-solid foundation for his band with steady rhythms and quick double bass-ing, with some very impressive fills thrown in for good measure. Henkka doesn\u2019t stand out as much as he could, though that\u2019s easily forgivable as he\u2019s got some very fast and technical guitar to follow, and he never misses a beat in that respect.\n\nNow, onto a real controversial topic on this album: Alexi Laiho\u2019s vocals. On this album, Alexi has gone for a decidedly lower-end, barking style quite unlike his death/black metal shrieking of the past. Again, this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing as it fits with the album\u2019s direction (though I\u2019ll be the first to admit I found myself missing the Follow the Reaper and Hatebreeder style quite a bit). Alexi also steps out a bit on some songs, using whispers, half-narrations (see Needled 24/7), more gang shouts and even pseudo-clean vocals on a few tracks, all of which are fairly hit-and-miss on the album, in my opinion. Overall however, Alexi turns in a solid, well-fit performance.\n\nThe songs themselves, range from solid to downright jaw-dropping to anthemic at times. Needled 24/7 is a speedy, catchy opener that\u2019s sure to pull the listener in immediately. Other favorites of mine include concert staple Sixpounder, the crushing and melodic Bodom Beach Terror, Triple Corpse Hammerblow (I can\u2019t help but chant \u201cdon\u2019t push me!\u201d and \u201cTRIPLE CORPSE! HAMMERBLOW!\u201d every time this one plays) and the closing title track, which is a goddamn anthem for any devoted fan.\n\nAll in all, despite being quite the change from Children of Bodom\u2019s \u201cclassic\u201d sound, Hate Crew Deathroll is a damn fine album, and one I can\u2019t imagine any fan of the band\u2019s preceding output not enjoying.\n",
        "\nCHILDREN OF BODOM's rise to the metallic stratosphere should not be without scrutiny. While I think they deserve such accolades and have apparently scraped their way to the top, their detriment upon recieving this exposure comes off as problematic. \"Something Wild\", \"Hatebreeder\" and \"Follow the Reaper\" should have been the gold standard to which the listening public should have latched onto, if you ask me. \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" was a decent album, but was obviously the downward spiral of things to come, that which would bring us the detestable \"Are You Dead Yet?\" With that latest output, the future seemed dark and cloudy for the once-and-future-kings of Finnish metal, and upon word of a new album, trepidation and plentiful eggshells to be walked across were possibly to pass...\n\nBut they tried...oh Lordy Lord how they tried...\n\nWhile not bringing back the Mozarty hell we once knew and loved, \"Blooddrunk\" does, if nothing else, redeem the BODOM boys from the mid-paced dreck of previous outings. A definative thrash metal backbone is key to some very meaty and chunky riffs heaped upon ear-drum annihilating percussion work that at times clutters the final mix. The energetic sensation of a band truly loving the hell out of their performance that was so missing in the last two albums has returned, albeit a bit more reigned in, and with a proverbial manicure as opposed to unsheathed claws. But while this comes off as a far tastier outing of metallic wonderment, Alexi and company plow through sweet-but-recycled riffery and slightly symphonic interludes with a phoned-in performance, a \"BODOM by numbers\", if you will, where melodic death metal guitar leads mix with double-bass percussive abuse, mixed-down synth lines that are just sorta there, and weaker, croaking vocals where once hateful screams permeated. But the band has more than their fair share of positivity as seen in the heavier, more chaotic works of \"LoBodomy\", \"Tie My Rope\", \"Smile Pretty for the Devil\" (with a very nice, hypnotic guitar lead near the last few riffs) and \"Roadkill Morning\", where their antics combine into neck-wrecking madness the likes of which would make any ardent metalhead proud. However, that doesn't mean all that glitters is gold, as a few less-than-stellar tracks litter within the cluttered masses of riffs and blast beats, from \"Banned from Heaven\" to \"Hellhounds on my Trail\"...not necessarily bad songs, but are best left as background music instead of the attention-seeking merriment the rest of the disc provides.\n\nSo all in all this is not a perfect CHILDREN OF BODOM album, but it still goes to show that if the band tried they can put out a quality product. Let's hope future works expand on this knowledge.\n",
        "\nThis Finnish based band was formed in 1997. Their name came from a murder which occurred in 1960 at Lake Bodom. 3 out of 4 teens were stabbed to death but the murder mystery is still unresolved. On 'Something Wild', the band started off playing melodic death metal. However, 'Hatebreeder' was the first album that I've ever heard by them. It was wholly unique in my estimation and I've been a fan ever since. Their newer style of metal seems like a combination of melodic death and thrash metal combined. At least that's my opinion in regards to 'Blooddrunk' wholeheartedly.\n\nThere seems to be a lot of mixed opinions in regards to this new release. I disliked it at the start and now I'm pretty glued to it. It isn't a poor effort by the band to be honest. The music has unique melodic/thrash style riffs and the keyboards augment the guitars keeping that style that they are so well noted for having. 'Blooddrunk' to me is better than their previous release 'Are You Dead Yet?' because the riffs are catchier making COB sound more like their older material. That really seems like the jist of it.\n\nI wouldn't consider the music to be in the genre of power metal at all. Again melodic death/thrash metal is more accurate. The crunch tone guitars and Alexi's screaming vocals leaves me to conclude that they're trying to sound a little different with their riffs/genres. The keys augment the guitar's \"heavier\" tone. I think all of the tracks are noteworthy. There really aren't any that I dislike. 'Blooddrunk' seems to capture me as being more of a mature release by the band. It doesn't fail in rating as an album in COB's discography.\n\nCrunchier tone guitar is what they use here as opposed past releases. The production is solid with each instrument mixed quite well. The vocals are blended in good in addition to the music. However, the lead guitars aren't quite as \"chilling\" to hear. It seems like they've kind of digressed in that department. I consider the leads on 'Hate Crew Deathroll' to be catchier. Nevertheless, the sound still features the COB that I've always considered to be. This release is very noteworthy.\n\nIt's rumored that Alexi was fed up with people criticizing his lyrics so they aren't featured on the insert booklet. His vocals on this album are pretty much the same as on past releases. The back-up vocals by the band are also featured to give it more of a wholehearted effort augmenting Alexi's outputs. In terms of covers, there aren't any featured here on the US version of the album.\n\nDespite all of the negative criticism 'Blooddrunk' received, I don't really think it's warranted. The reason is because I don't consider the band to have lost their edge that they held musically in past releases. I definitely consider 'Blooddrunk' to be a solid COB release. Just because they're trying to wedge in a \"thrashier\" sound to the music doesn't mean that they've just went to hell. As far as if they deserve to be written off as now piss poor musicians, I don't feel that way at all towards this new release.\n",
        "\nLive DVDs are rather tricky, they\u2019re either really good, or they completely suck. That is the case with this split DVD Unholy Alliance. Featuring Slayer\u2026and a bunch of talentless side acts like Lamb of God. And let me tell you, this is completely forgettable. \n\nSlayer sounds like a good band to see live don\u2019t they? Maybe not on this DVD but in general yes they would be. Slayer plays only ten songs ranging from good early ere to bad new ere. The worst part about their performance other than some of the songs would be the triggered drums. They just sound so clunky and you can tell that they\u2019re there. Tom\u2019s voice is also not the greatest, but that\u2019s mostly due to age, so you have to deal with that. The crowd is into their performance, every time the camera focuses on someone in the crowd they\u2019re usually flicking off the camera. Some of the songs are actually very good, \u201cAngle of Death\u201d sounds awesome, and \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d also another good one, probably the best song out of the bunch. The green smoke on the stage during the songs also is pretty cool. The new songs still suck even life however, \u201cCult\u201d is horrible, easily their worst song. I found it kind of weird how \u201cReign in Blood\u201d wasn\u2019t on here, after all that is probably the most famous Slayer song. Still Slayer gives the best performance on this DVD and they\u2019re the only reason why anyone should even get this. \n\nAfter the Slayer performance we have Mastodon, and they\u2019re the second best act on here, but that\u2019s only because their competition would include Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, and some act that you probably never heard of. I just don\u2019t get their style, like what exactly are they? They have a lot of groove in their bass, yet a lot of mindless guitar leads with their guitarist. Generally the songs are simple, with basic bass work and a simple rhythm, them some random solo comes out of nowhere. These guys in general are nothing more than a hard rock band with a few interesting solos here and there. The most interesting thing about their performance is that \u201cCapillarian Crest\u201d has an interesting audio clip in the beginning of the song. \n\nNow we come to what is the worst song on the DVD, and it\u2019s by no one other than Lamb of God. We all know these guys suck on album, but holy shit there are unlistenable live. They play \u201cVigil\u201d which I guess is their best song, but like all Lamb of God songs; it sounds like every other Lamb of God song. Basically groove chugging riffs, lame solo, breakdown, another chugging riff, and songs over. Halfway through the song he spends about a minute trying to get the crowd to form a circle pit, but what\u2019s annoying about it is that he is still using his annoying singing voice. Apparently this guys normal talking voice is the exact same as his singing voice. After hearing this song I\u2019m just glad their on stage for only five minutes.\n\nChildren of Bodom would be next, and I\u2019ve never really cared for these guys, mostly because they\u2019re so boring. \u201cAngles Don\u2019t Cry\u201d is dull, sounds uninspired as if they didn\u2019t want to perform it in the first place. Alexi still can\u2019t sing. He\u2019s basically doing hardcore shouts for the whole performance. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d starts off with chugging riffs and an annoying keyboard lead. Alexi still uses hardcore screams, only he\u2019s even more emotionless. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d is just one of those modern teenage oriented metalcore songs, basically the lyrical content of the song is \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck motherfucker\u201d over and over in the chorus. Just like Lamb of God, they\u2019re forgettable.\n\nThe final band is Thine Eyes Bleed, who I never heard of until I heard them on this DVD. I can see why now too, they\u2019re basically modern melodic death, so they got some metalcore influences. Worst thing about their performance is hands down their vocalist. Basically he is your typical monotone singer that consists of hardcore shouts, and ear bleeding shrieks, much like the vocals from Blythe on Lamb of God. Slower groove passages, a weak solo, and ends with a chugging breakdown is how this song goes. Drumming is also annoying due to the fact that the drums are triggered. Triggers are annoying especially when there used with nonstop blast beats. This is just a terrible way to end the DVD, although considering how almost every performance is mediocre to horrible; I guess it makes sense to end it this way. \n\nSo this DVD has gotten a dubbed production job. You know the one where the songs have that semi live feel to them. Every performance has triggered drums; everything has been worked on to sound sharper, crisper guitar sound, more audible bass and what not. But that takes away the whole live feeling of it all. There\u2019s also no intermission or switch to the next song. After every song the screen cuts black, then the band name and the name of the song they will play appears, then it kicks right into the song, there\u2019s literally no interaction with the crowd whatsoever except for the quick Lamb of God bit. \n\nWell considering how only Slayer is worth hearing, and considering how only about half their songs are also worth hearing, this is just a really bad DVD. The guest acts\u2026well all suck really, playing generic metalcore songs at best by all of them. Slayer is the highlight of this album and only six of their ten songs are worth hearing. So if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now you can completely ignore this DVD.\n",
        "\nIt was destined to happen...stylistic simplicity, I mean. It happens to the best music groups in one way or another, at any time in their existence...whether it's a well-chronicled fall from grace or a more gradual descent into proverbial tar pits, most (but not all) metal groups are not immune to a few rocks thrown into the river of creativity, slightly marring the flow of musical juices but not damming it completely. CHILDREN OF BODOM are, sadly, not an exception to the rule. They stormed the scene with three absolute killer releases (the chaotic \"Something Wild\", the Mozarty \"Hatebreeder\" and the aggressive \"Follow the Reaper\"), and it looked as though everything would come up roses for these stalwart Finns, as they reaped the benefit of their unholy fusion of classic rock and symphonic black metal the likes of which many may have tried but unduly failed. And so, with the looming shadows of Century Media's worldwide distribution hanging over them like so many Swords of Damacles, the listener would wonder if, musically, the cup would runneth over.\n\nIt didn't, really. More like a mere splash off the side.\n\n\"Hate Crew Deathroll\" finds the BODOM boys continuing their tried-and-true classic/al metal path, but more simplistic in approach. Maybe it was the difficulty following up \"Follow the Reaper\", or the increase in touring watering down the inspiration, but \"Deathroll\", while being a solid and very listenable album, lacks the punch the first three albums teemed with. The music became more riff-heavy, tempos slowed to a mid-paced trot, and the lyrics became more apprehensive and confrontational, but over-all the album eschews much of the \"been there, done that\" appeal and continues to remain fresh even after repeated listens. In a way, this album could be considered the \"gateway drug\" of the BODOM discography, an ease into the earlier, more angry material, but still a fun little romp of metaldom nonetheless. Alexi Laiho still proves to have more songwriting and guitaring talent in one hand than some of his scene contemporaries, as evidenced on heavy slabs of beef like \"Little Bloodred Riding Hood\", \"Needled 24-7\" and \"You're Better Off Dead\", as well as slower tracks, from the bludgeoning (\"Sixpounder\", \"Bodom Beach Terror\") to the dirgey (\"Angels Don't Kill\"). The trade-off solos would appear even better and tighter between him, now-ex-axeman Alexander Kuoppola and keymaster Janne Warman, coming off as musical conversations as opposed to two players going through the motions. However, for as good as the album is, it can leave a fan from the very start of their career a bit underwhelmed, as it appears more hollow and \"mainstream\" than one would expect. That would be the chief problem, as finding other negative issues would be a fruitless endeavor.\n\nSo in the end, while not exactly on par with their earlier works, \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" is still a satisfying foray into metal done right, and considering what had befallen the metal world in the years up to this release, the listener couldn't ask for anything more. Thumbs up.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom have indeed extended their sound in new directions since the \u201cHatebreeder\u201d days. \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d served as a perfect example of how mainstream exposure can mitigate the music of a very good band, but I am relieved to say that Children of Bodom have taken a step forward. The way I see it, every album following \u201cFollow the Reaper\u201d was a step backward, but \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d is on about the same level as \u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d. For those of you that don\u2019t see what I\u2019m getting at, I\u2019ll put it in blunt terms: this album is about 20% crap and 80% metal. If there\u2019s anybody out there holding your breath for another \u201cFollow the Reaper\u201d or \u201cHatebreeder\u201d album, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to suffocate. \n\nWhile \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d still maintains the signature Bodom sound, elements of neo-classical power metal have vanished. Alexi still shreds and wails like no other Finnish guitarist; Janne dominates the synths; drummer, rhythm, bassist are a rock steady rhythm section; but the overall sound of the band is a hell of a lot heavier than ever before. I think they\u2019ve managed to capture what they were going for in \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d successfully, and this is a new sound I could get used to. \n\nRight away there is a fist in face moment as \u201cHellbound On My Trail\u201d kicks the album off, and you\u2019re thinking, \u201cHey, maybe this won\u2019t be so bad after all. The riffing is thrashy, the drums are good, and the synths are used tastefully.\u201d Then you have a moment of clarity and a tear is shed, right? Fuck no. Then you start headbanging because this is some of the most wicked shit you\u2019ve heard out of Bodom in a long time. The title track continues this killing spree, CoB are on a roll and the death toll is rising. Okay, then we hit a bit of a wall with \u201cLobodomy\u201d\u2026 don\u2019t get me wrong the chorus of this song is pure fucking genius and the track has its moments along with some good soloing and a good bridge, but come on, they\u2019ve taken the Bodom theme and driven it right off a cliff. \u201cOne Day You Will Cry\u201d is the exact opposite of \u201cLobodomy\u201d, a great intro, but the chorus and bridge leave something to be desired. \u201cSmile Pretty For The Devil\u201d is another addition to the killing spree, and is a pretty fucking sweet track that leads you right into the gem of the album: \u201cTie My Rope\u201d. This track is just straight up sick, everything you could wish for, heavy, melodic, and catchy. \u201cDone With Everything, Die For Nothing\u201d is a decent track, but nothing special. \u201cBanned From Heaven\u201d is another one of my favorite tracks; I consider it the \u201cballad\u201d of the album. \u201cRoadkill Morning\u201d is another thrashy track that ends the album rather abruptly, a quality I always enjoy in a good metal album. \n\nAlmost everything on this album serves a purpose. The closest it gets to fillers are \u201cSmile Pretty For the Devil\u201d, \u201cDone With Everything, Die For Nothing\u201d and \u201cRoadkill Morning\u201d, which are all fun decent tracks regardless. The production is top notch and vocals are atrocious just like I like them. So if you get the time pick it up and give it a spin or two. You might like the new heavier Children of Bodom. All I have to say is that this album is a fucking massacre and it will indeed leave you \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d.\n\nStandout tracks: \u201cTie My Rope\u201d, \u201cBanned From Heaven\u201d\n",
        "\nI simply cannot believe that people other than strung out tweens can actually listen to this anymore. The downfall of this band is both one of metal's greatest mysteries and pitfalls. COB had such a great start, with uplifting, catchy melodic death coupled with amazing fretwork, good songwriting and just enough bite to be considered credible. Sure they may have stolen a few riffs from Dissection, but that was still okay because the material was so good. Then Hatecrew Deathroll happened, and the downfall began. This record is a continuation of that and is a total disgrace to true metal anywhere. \n\nGone are the slightly black metal-tinged parts with cool melodies. Gone is the slick songwriting and just about everything else this band had going for it. To use the term sellout is taking it easy on these guys. Are You Dead Yet? is full of mock anger, stupid lyrics and basic mallcore-like riffs that can only make a pimply faced teenager freak out. It has all gotten so immature and unbecoming of a self-respecting band. Alexi Laiho is a gifted guitarist, but he chooses to wank off over cheap punky riffs while spewing out immature \"Fuck You Bitch!\" lyrics and the kids are falling for it. Is this really the same band that wrote \"Kissing the Shadows\"?\n\nThe only reason I give this album points is for one song. \"If You Want Peace Prepare for War\", despite its stupid title, is a good song reminiscent and worthy of their past albums with very cool lead sections and catchy riffs. That is one song out of nine which makes for 11.1% so that's the grade I'm giving it. \n\nBesides that you're stuck with unimaginative songwriting, uninspired riffs and leads and just way too much cheese to be taken seriously. Unfortunately they have paved the way for many other terrible bands to \"trailblaze\" and take the scene by storm. This creates a wimpy scene where people are willing to subject themselves to shitty music and call it art, or in this case \"troo metal\". I guess metal just isn't what it used to be.\n\nCheck out their first three records if you want to hear Children of Bodom, because this album is just crap and a total disgrace to the genre I love and grew up with.\n",
        "\nI love the genre of Melodic Death Metal. The brutality combined with melody nature of it always seems to do something for me, no matter what. One of the most acclaimed albums in the genre is Children Of Bodom's second effort, Hatebreeder, but I never could get into that album, it just seemed sub-standard. And re-listening to it over and over, I realised that it was.\n\nIn case you don't know what the album sounds like, it's pretty much your standard 'extreme power Metal' - a brand of melodic death Metal where the 'melodic' parts are reminiscent of power Metal. Basically, throw fast drumming, melodic riffs, shredded guitar solos, neo-classical keyboards and harsh screamed vocals into a melting pot and you have Hatebreeder.\n\nA large part of Hatebreeder is the solos. Every solo section on the album follows the same pattern - guitar first, then keyboard. The keyboard always plays something incredibly similar to the guitar, so it's like a recycled version of the solo I've just heard, and combined with the keyboard's annoyingly chirpy tone the keyboard solos are pretty awful. Such is best on display during the painfully bad solo duel at the end of the title track. The guitar solos, sadly, aren't much better. I don't know if Alexi just needed more practice at this point, but many of the guitar solos are just not as well composed as later works - listen to the closing solo of 'Black Widow' to see what I mean. Also, considering there's a lengthy solo in each track and a lack of substantial diversity between them, there's just too many solos on Hatebreeder overall.\n\nTalking about the keyboard, there are parts of the album where Janne plays (on his own, the rest of the band stops) something 'atmospheric' with his keys. Sometimes these will appear flat bang in the middle of songs, for example, the 'atmospheric' keyboard line which comes in at 1:53 of 'Silent Night, Bodom Night' hurts the momentum of the song (which was going pretty good) while adding nothing to it in the process; completely unnecessary. The atmospheric parts try to make things sound eerie, but with all the cheesy, happy sounding riffs throughout the album (more on that later), it just doesn't work at all. The intro to 'Bed Of Razors' is another example - you can see they wanted it to be atmospheric and all, but it's such a catchy riff/tune that it totally fails to create the eerie and cold atmosphere they seemed to be going for. Another example is 'Downfall', it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe riff work on this album is pretty poor. The main problem here is that many of the melodic riffs sound incredibly cheesy and thin. For example, the part from 2:03 - 2:35 of the title track sounds ridiculously happy, largely due to the guitar riff which sounds like a watered-down version of something you'd get in one of Iron Maiden's cheesier songs. Another example is the opening melody in 'Towards Dead End' and the melodic riff at 0:22 of 'Children Of Bodom'; they sound childish and borderline nauseating. Another problem I have with the riff department is the fact this album lacks something all Extreme Metal albums should have - heavy, headbangable riffs. I honestly couldn't find one riff that was good for headbanging in all of Hatebreeder, which is something I can't say about Follow The Reaper or Something Wild.\n\nThe rhythm section is pretty unspectacular. The bass mostly follows the guitars and is barely audible, although there is an awesome bass lead in 'Warheart' and another gem at 2:53 - 3:00 in 'Children Of Bodom'. Apart from some well placed blast beats in a few songs, the drums do absolutely nothing of interest, sticking to samey patterns and fills the whole way through. While they can't save Hatebreeder from the monstrosity it is, I can't say Laiho's vocals are bad. His screams are nice and brutal throughout, and there's even some variance with a lower, almost guttural growl he does occasionally.\n\nAnd as for the songs themselves, well, there's not much to say. All have very similar structures, tempos, melodies, solos and whatever else, making them hard to distinguish from one another and ultimately unmemorable. Some songs do stand out though, those being 'Warheart', 'Silent Night, Bodom Night' and 'Downfall'. Besides those though, no one song sounds better than any other. \n\nOverall, despite some good parts and general catchiness, this album just fails in every way. The solos are poor, the attempts at creating atmposphere sound silly, the riffs generally sound incredibly cheesy, the rhythm section does nothing of interest and the songs lack diversity. If you're looking for some good 'Extreme Power Metal', try Bodom's Follow The Reaper, Something Wild or early Norther and Kalmah.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom have really created a masterpiece with this album. Before coming across this album I had only heard Are You Dead Yet? and remained blind to COB's excellence. The tracks remain furiously fast and brutal, but have a discernable melody. Shredding guitars, steely keyboards and harsh screams are the name of the game with Follow the Reaper, providing a careful dose of both excellent song writing and thrashing speed. To get a good idea of what this album is all about, find a sample of the title track, or the ever popular \"Hate Me\". \n\nOf all of the musical genius of this album, the most prominent to my ears was the incredible guitar work. Alexi Laiho is notorious for his axemanship, being rated with the top 50 fasted guitar players in Guitar World magazine, and you can really tell where this fame comes from. Solos are intertwined within several of the songs, often laced with keyboards, and the result is just awe inspiring. Speaking of the keyboards, WOW! They don't overpower the songs, have catchy melodies and just generally fit in perfectly within this melodic death metal gem. I find myself humming along with their speedy licks. \n\nThe drums are well done, with beats put out effectively and intelligently, as opposed to nonstop blast beats. I am not a drummer and listen more for guitar work and vocals in metal, but it is so annoying when a repetitive, weak drummer is in an otherwise good band. Fortunately Children of Bodom do not have that problem in any way. \n\nThe vocals are quite excellent. Harsh, yet still understandable. You can hear the clever, dark lyrics easily without having to decipher them with the lyrics booklet. Death metal usually poses somewhat of a problem in that aspect, at least if you are interested in what the musicians have to say. Laiho's wicked screams are intense and satisfying without being overpowering and forced. \n\nNotably, this album contains small lines of quotes in a few songs. Usually I dislike it when albums have much spoken word type stuff, but the quotes are short and to the point. Well chosen and well placed, they sum up the song they are present in. The lines add to the dark atmosphere of the music as much as the Grim Reaper on the front cover adds to the visual atmosphere. \n\nIts hard for me to say anything bad about Children of Bodom, as I have liked all of their albums, but this one stands out to me as one of the best melodic death metal albums I have ever heard. Hell, it would probably make my top ten list of metal albums I've ever heard. To wrap this up, if you are a Bodom fan, make this album a must-have. \n\nA few favorite songs: Children of Decadence, Bodom After Midnight, Follow the Reaper, Hate Me!, Taste of My Scythe\n",
        "\nIn the process of slowly changing their sound since HCD, Bodom have lost something. I don't think it's as bad as a lot of people say, but you can't deny that the classical elements are sorely missing.\n\nThankfully, this album is at least better than their last (Are You Dead Yet?). Yes, it's just as cheesy (when have COB not been cheesy) and it's almost as angsty, but on first hearing this album, I felt quite a bit of relief.\n\nThe album's thrash leanings are its strong point, which is good, because if this album wasn't fast and catchy, nothing could save it. The lack of keyboards from AYDY has somewhat been remedied on this album, but still Warman's classical abilities are underused yet again.\n\nFar be it from me to tell a band with such talent and good past releases what to do. I'm just a guy who likes music. I don't think it's anyone's right to complain about what someone enjoys playing. After all, if any artist keeps doing the same thing, they'd all get boring and stink worse than one that tries something different and disappoints a few elitists.\n\nIn saying that, while I didn't 'agree' with what they were doing on Are You Dead Yet, this album has made me smile. It's a shitload more interesting, and hopefully some kind of indication that band hasn't stagnated just yet.\n",
        "\nHow do you mix nasty, full on aggressive assault while also playing blazing melodies? If you do no think this is possible please listen to Children\u2019s of Bodom\u2019s Follow the Reaper. I always thought it was the cold climate of Finland that gives Bodom there musical inspiration but you can really here see the adjectives that describe there music quite analogous. It is bitter, angry, and gives you an eerie feeling of comfort at the same time (sort like a blizzard). During this album we see a little less of the keyboards which sound like a steel pan (the infamous Bodom sound). The speed has not been turned down what so ever so you are still getting your full dosage of all out headbanging. \n\nSongs are crafted more harmoniously as oppose to unexpected tempo and key changes which really throw of the pace of the song. It defiantly shows a sign maturity in Bodom\u2019s musical abilities. Lyrics on this album could have not possibly had more angst. For evidence check out \u201cHate Me\u201d. As a perfect compliment during the end of songs and at the beginning of others little \u201cfills\u201d of quotes are inserted. But do not worry; they are not lame sayings but rather a brief synopsis of the song that proceeded. Let me just say that some of the most talented players of current metal are on this band. Every single member of the band can play at an absolutely mind boggling speed on their instruments. Now speed is completely useless if you do not have technique but, as evidence of their talent I have see them live (to bad I cannot use evidence to actually prove it, but for now just take my word for it).\n\nTowards the end of the album the songs start waning off in too forgettable fillers, but at least you won\u2019t have to jump to the later tracks. However that is not a reason not to purchase this album. So an 88 is a fair score. To best describe this album imagine an old record player and your blasting some old school Maiden or Priest. Now spin the record twice as fast and there you go. Except for the mousy singing that will be a byproduct. You will here Alexi\u2019s patented black metal like style screeching growl (or however you would like to describe it). All this and more crammed into less than 40 minutes and 9 songs of pure hatred. \n\nSickest Songs \u201cFollow the Reaper\u201d \u201cBodom after Midnight\u201d \u201cChildren of Decadence\u201d\n",
        "\nIn my previous review for a Children of Bodom album, where I cited Follow The Reaper as one of the greatest albums ever made, I've since found that most people do not like Bodom's newer, more groove oriented sound. To me, I really did not care. I honestly liked it as much as I liked albums like Follow The Reaper, Hatebreeder, and Something Wild. I was still afraid though, since the album wreaked of metalcore influence and I was afraid that Bodom was going to become a full fledged metalcore band. Then I figured that they could always go back to the Something Wild formula. Or something else could happen.\n\nBlooddrunk is sort of a middle ground for Bodom fans. This is truly Children of Bodom's attempts at appeasing everyone, which is odd considering they have appealed to metalheads who are into virtually genres with ease. Are You Dead Yet caused a split among fans, with one side being the more \"true\" fans into Bodom's older keyboard driven numbers and others that are \"scene kids\" because along with Bodom they prefer bands like Lamb of God and Killswitch Engage (and often rank Bodom among these bands). Alexi and crew must have realized this division (which is not going to be healed ever) and they tried to please everyone. This is not the return to the Alexander Kuppala days like the \"true\" fans wanted. Yet Bodom is not a metalcore band. Instead, Alexi shouts another big fat \"fuck you\" through the music on Blooddrunk, and that comes out as sort of a mixed bag.\n\nThe album opens up with Hellhounds on my Trail, and one can get a good preview of what is going on. That's song fiery intro brings back Follow The Reaper memories while mixing them in with Hate Crew Deathroll like riffs. Coupled with the wicked drum skills from Jaske and the crushing guitar rhythms of Roope and Alexi, you can tell right away Bodom found another edge again. Blooddrunk is more thrashy then previous Bodom albums, and I've seen so far that many people are not pleased by this. I am pleased by it. Why repeat the earlier albums formula again and again? Wouldn't that just get boring. Maybe to some it won't, but I know it would to me. So what's wrong with playing fast, palm muted riffs, downtuned to drop C? Absolutely nothing if you ask me. \n\nThe album also has more keyboards in it then Are You Dead Yet did. They are also much more diverse. While the keyboards in Are You Dead yet were mostly industrial esque synthesizers that sounded a lot like Rammstein, Janne Warmen brings back some of the classical sounding keyboards that were prevalent on earlier Bodom albums. For all those who liked the industrial synths of Are You Dead Yet, there are plenty of those to. While his keyboard work is nothing like it was on Hatebreeder (where he arguably gave his best performance ever), he still has plenty of impressive moments on Blooddrunk. The keyboard solos on songs like Hellhounds on My Trail, the title track, One Day You Will Cry, Smile Pretty For The Devil, Tie My Rope, and Banned From Heaven positively rock. They are very fast, sacrificing some of Janne's insane technicality but being incredibly fast and still being quite skilled. Still, the overall sound of Bodom on this album is a more guitar oriented sound, so all you \"true\" fans are not going to be into this. \n\nHenkka's bass is more prevalent on this album then others. Now the bass actually can be heard throughout the whole album, and does not play a ghost like \"now you hear me now you don't role\". It's not very loud but you can hear it under all the rhythms and when it does show up, like on Smile Pretty For The Devil, it has stunning clarity and bite that does not show up much on metal albums. Great stuff. Though I still feel that Henkka is somewhat held back.\n\nJaske's drum work shows that he's still on top of his game. The wicked double bass skills are still there, very fast and pummeling. His technicality has not gone downhill and he's still very strong and respectable in the drum department. He even blast beats here and there on Blooddrunk, something we have not seen him really do since Hatebreeder. Good to see he's sort of going back to the good old days I guess.\n\nAlso, for once we see Bodom doing some thought provoking lyrics, but only on one song. Oddly enough, it's a song about something that Bodom's frontman Alexi is really well known for, alcoholism. Blooddrunk invokes greatly how alcoholism messes with someone and paints a very gory and rather brutal picture of just how bad this addiction and disease is. It's rather strange to see Bodom writing lyrics like this, but it was a good move. Bodom has never and I mean never had any lyrics that are thought provoking, and this is pretty damn cool to see them at least attempting it. Maybe they'll try this more on later albums. \n\nAlexi's vocals are a bit harsher then they were on Are You Dead Yet, sacrificing their audibility for more bite and you cannot understand them as much as Are You Dead Yet's can. They are still good though, very clear plenty of times and still being very tough and gritty like Alexi is known for. I do not care much for the loss in clarity, the vocal patterns make up for it. We also hear Alexi experimenting with some more low oriented vocals and whispering throughout Blooddrunk. Good to see he's breaking up all the monotony that came with Something Wild and Hatebreeder's rasps. \n\nAlexi though does cause some problems. For one thing, the guitar department with him and Roope Latvala is not up to speed. The main problem I have are the solos. While they are generally much faster then they were on Are You Dead Yet, they are simply too short. The other problem is that there is way too much whammy bar use in the solos and not enough shred. The shred that is there is very fast and arguably some of the fastest shredding done by Alexi and Roope, but there is just not enough of it and too whammy bar usage to justify the lack of shred. Come on guys, it's not that hard to play a long solo now is it? You did not hurt yourself that badly did you Alexi? And even if you did just play rhythm and let Roope do all the leads. He is better then you anyway. \n\nThe riff work though I have no real problem with. As do I not have a problem with any of the songs on this album except for two, Done With Everything Die For Nothing and Roadkill Mourning. The former of these two sounds like a bad attempt at Bodom sounding like Killswitch Engage or Unearth, and the latter just seems plain sloppy and disorganized. The rest of the songs are very well executed and sound overall pretty well. \n\nThe last plus for this album though is the production, mixing, and mastering. In those areas, Blooddrunk is easily Bodom's best album. The drum tone of Jaske is very organic, not thin sounding and full of power and sound that just rocks. You can hear the acoustic drum tone amazingly, and the bass drums sound pummeling. They are not very clicky, but they are still very powerful and thunderous. The keyboards sound great, as does Henkka's bass, which is much more prevalent. The guitars of Alexi and Roope sound awesome as well. Easily Bodom's best sounding album, even if the music is not always it's best. \n\nSo, if you want the full return to Something Wild, you'll have to wait. If you want to hear Bodom being full blown metalcore, well you'll have to wait to. But if you are open minded enough, and realize the situation in Bodom's fanbase that is going on and are willing to listen, give Blooddrunk a chance. It will grow on you, and you'll find it's not the abomination of a record that many people seem to think it is.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom were, at least during their early years, one of those bands that contradict the rule that if something gets mainstream attention that it will be hollow and uninteresting. They have had their fair share of exposure along with Cradle of Filth on the whole Hot Topic bandwagon, and are often lumped together with musically inferior acts such as Slipknot and a whole barrage of mallcore acts. Naturally the traditional fan of melodic metal would be embarrassed at associating with the abomination that Korn and Limp Bizkit pioneered, which explains the hostility that is often unfairly levied at this band\u2019s older material. \n\nI can\u2019t fully explain the enigma of this band, particularly during this juncture of their career, being on the listening list along with bands that give Road Runner Records a bad name, other than there perhaps being a level of eclecticism amongst the monkey see, monkey do crowd that can associate real metal with Marilyn Manson. Perhaps it was my own personal lack of interest in anything associated with said scene that kept me unaware of this album, but upon first hearing it a little less than 2 years ago, I began to understand what all the hype was about.\n\n\u201cHatebreeder\u201d is a literal breeding ground of melody and flash with a thick sheet of seething rage guising as human shouts superimposed on top of it. At the time, the seemingly clashing elements of consonant melodic material being merged with toneless barks and growls was a melodic death convention, mostly lacking the blistering speed of the thrash and power metal genres which were also making serious headway at this juncture. The entire presentation on here is as tight and disciplined as a seasoned Neo-Classical outfit, unlike the sloppy mess heard on early Gothenburg acts, to who this band is often compared. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard of a single guitarist in the melodeath crowd that has ever tried to capture a balance between Kerry King\u2019s agitated brevity and Yngwie Malmsteen\u2019s majestic speed, let alone put forward a keyboard solo to rival it, as is the case here.\n\nThe album is often hard to follow because there are so many old and new influences packed together into each individual song. \u201cWarheart\u201d kicks off with a rapid Joey Demaio inspired bass riff before landing on a blur of tremolo notes and a tight yet vicious blast beat that conjures up memories of Mayhem, yet with a slight hint of Kreator as well. Harmonically speaking the song mostly resembles a really aggressive power metal song, but the attitude put forth in the lyrics and vocals scream late 80s thrash. \u201cCowards Dead End\u201d and \u201cSilent Night, Bodom Night\u201d combine the epic sensibilities of fellow Finnish acts such as Stratovarius with the same Kreator-inspired, knock you senseless, thrash metal punch. Some of the time the band actually presents some material not all that far removed from Slayer\u2019s \u201cHell Awaits\u201d, particularly the main riffs of \u201cWrath Within\u201d and the album\u2019s title track.\n\nNot willing to be restrained to merely a power/thrash model of aggression, the band also ventures into territory similar to that of the Gothenburg scene, but with a lot more finesse. \u201cBed of Razors\u201d, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d and \u201cDownfall\u201d embody brilliant marriages of soft, atmospheric keyboard work and a slightly less aggressive take on speed metal more proper to the melodeath sub-genre. If At the Gates and all of their various bastard spawn had a better sense of how to write a song, I\u2019d venture they\u2019d come up with something close to this, save the keyboards of course. \n\nAnd as far as the band\u2019s self-titled song \u201cChildren of Bodom\u201d goes; if you want to create some sort of top 10 list of most amazing songs in the aggressive yet melodic style, this one should definitely be on there. As most of what is on here has so many twists that memory retention becomes an issue, this song basically cancels out most of this very present flaw with a simple idea that gets developed like crazy. Tom Petty once said something to the affect that all the best songs make use of 3 to 5 chords, and this beast is no exception to the rule, although it\u2019s probably far more ambitious technically than anything any hard rock band would ever dream of creating.\n\nAs far as this checkered metal band goes, you don\u2019t really get a better picture of how they sound when they get it right than you do here. Most people tend to view \u201cFollow the Reaper\u201d as the band\u2019s songwriting zenith, but this has a lot more gusto and lacks the overly polished studio work that takes away from the aggression that this band touts in their lyrics. If you have a problem giving this album a chance solely because you don\u2019t like the bands fan base (I\u2019m also not particularly fond of the crowd in question), I\u2019d suggest getting over yourself and learning to separate the scene from the sounds, because you\u2019re missing out on some great music.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom have fallen quite far from their early brilliance in the form of Something Wild, Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper; that much was evident by the first couple of riffs on Hatecrew Deathroll, but at least that album still had some balls, despite being horribly annoying and mediocre. Their last album, Are You Dead Yet? was a transition into a more groove-laden, Lamb of God-esque sound, which was met with mixed reactions from the fans, with many citing the new direction as negative and making cries of \"sellout.\" Certainly their weakest album to date, it was only saved by a few tracks that seemed to radiate with exuberance, making for a pretty decent \"fun\" listen. Not good, but tolerable. Not the failure everyone claimed it to be, but the detractors did not back down.\n\n...and the retort from the band, two years later? Blooddrunk, an exercise in tedium that I had not yet seen before. So what's the deal, guys? Fans didn't like the more modern sound, so you decided to chug out an album of songs that sound like rejects from the Hatebreeder recording sessions? The basic sound present on Blooddrunk is reminiscent of the sound Children of Bodom started off with - high-flying, diving, winding guitar solos, a heavy dose of synths, and some thrashy riffs thrown in for good measure (more modern here than in the past, definitely taking cues from the previous album), all topped off with Alexi's harsh yowl. I didn't want to do this, but Blooddrunk doesn't look so good, and there's no way around it. Children of Bodom are without an alibi at the scene of the crime - selling out, that is.\n\nThis whole album sounds like a somewhat effective return to form on first listen, but after a while it hits you just how bad this really is. Yeah, it sounds like Hatebreeder, and yeah, it sure does have a bigger keyboard/solo presence just like the old stuff did, but if you think that makes this better than the grooving riffs and restrained synths of AYDY?, then you need to re-evaluate your standards. This whole album sounds like the older stuff, and the more die-hard fans of the band will be quick to sing the band's praises once again, but by the end of your first listen, it sinks in: this album is a lame, watered down rehash of everything that the band originally became popular for in the first place. What's the deal, Alexi? Did you feel bad for alienating your older fans, and thus decide to go halfway back to the old sound? Because I'm really at a loss for any other explanation. You can't just do that; chickening out like this. No band can. Either go all the way or don't go down the road at all. Blooddrunk is very desensitized, bland music, lacking any semblance of the creative, manic energy the band used to have, as if it were filtered out like water would be before being released to the masses. It's the worst possible outcome of their new metalcore/groove style flirting with the older neoclassical-whatsit Melodeath they used to play, mashed together into a shapeless lump without hooks, flow or any sort of memorability. We're not falling for this, you cretins. Hear me? We're not going to keep eating up this crap just because you throw in a few \"old school Bodom\" solos and synth melodies amidst your modern shash. Fuck that.\n\nThere was no reason to shift direction once again after the chugga-chugga tuff-guy style of AYDY? (stick with one style, idiots!), but they did it anyway. Instead of expanding on that style, as the old Bodom would've done, they took the easy way out and tried to appeal to everyone at the same time, and that is where they failed. This isn't a good modern Metal album, nor is it a good revision of the band's old sound. Children of Bodom were a good band in the first place, after all, because of their subtle progression from album to album while still remaining in their signature style. That's all out the window now, replaced with a hollow shell of a band too afraid to experiment or step outside of their little box. Now they sound like their own cover band. Artistic death; an album without any form of innovation or creativity at all, not even the band's own individual \"voice.\" Blooddrunk is completely disposable, the epitome of pussification and cowardice. I'm ashamed ever to have liked this band. Bodom has nowhere left to go, for they have already watered down their sound to the utmost extreme. Utterly worthless.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nI held Bodom in high regards ever since their first release. HCDR was okay, and I even gave AYDY a few more listens before I made any final judgments, and it turned out to be not so bad, some crappy repetitive riffs, but also some memorable songs, and pretty decent solos. \n\nNow onto Blooddrunk. I have listened to this cd front to back numerous times, and every time I go back to listen to it I feel as though I have never listened to most of the songs on the cd before. Some of you might think this is good, that means I am always finding new things in the music, but this is not the case. It\u2019s because nothing in the whole cd sticks to my memory, this whole cd is completely forgettable, with the exception of the lead in Tie My Rope, and the lead in the title song Blooddrunk, and I regret saying this because Blooddrunk sounds to me basically like a Lamb of God song, but mixed with the COB formula. I know COB have borrowed a few riffs, maybe even almost copied a few from artists, but this is kind of ridiculous, not only does it show that they are running out of ideas, it also makes it look like they are half-assing their song writing. If you can\u2019t come up with something original and you need to copy a riff or a lead, at least make it your own by adding some kind of flavor to it. Not only does the riff in Blooddrunk sound like a complete copy of LOG... need I even say anything about the vocals in the beginning of the song.\n\nThe rest of the vocals on the cd are okay, nothing bad. Great screams and some great trade mark yaw-yaws! But the lyrics are another story. Alexi always said in interviews that he never really cared for lyrics, and some of the lyrics for songs were done right there in the studio. But around the HCDR era and after, he began to try harder, and actually make sense of what he was talking about. Some songs were good, and some just sucked. But most of the lyrics from Blooddrunk are a complete fucking joke. \u201cIn the blink of an eye you're fighting, Look at me chump, champ is my name, Were you going to all laugh? I'll Always be.\u201d I mean really, what happened to reapers, and death, and dying when your only 21, now COB think they are fucking Throwdown. Almost all the lyrics sound juvenile.\n\nMost of the time when artists write material, they stick relatively within a central theme if anything. You don\u2019t usually hear bands talking about Satan in one song and then singing that Jesus is your savior in the next, or talk about dragon slaying and then about muscle cars. COB are a little to scattered on this cd for my taste. One song they are talking about getting drunk and how it can ruin your life, and the next they are talking about being \u201cBanned from Heaven.\u201d It\u2019s like Alexi just threw in a track from a slow paced Sinergy album and passed it off as COB, I can almost hear Kimberly Goss saying \u201cIt should have been me singing in this song Waahhh!\u201d Another thing is the \u201cshout outs\u201d they happen way to often on this cd. I don\u2019t mind them once in a while, but on half the songs it gets kind of old. Even though the lyrics and content suck, the vocals are still good.\n\nThe production is great too, it\u2019s what you\u2019ve come to expect from the newer COB. All the instruments are audible and clear, even if a lot of the guitar licks aside from the leads are just variations of chug-chug-chug, chiga-chug-chug-chug. Some solos are also decent, even though they are not as good as on the other albums these guys are still some very talented musicians. Overall this album is completely forgettable, with the exception of maybe two songs. I know it\u2019s a new direction for COB, and you can\u2019t rewrite the same shit over and over again, and you need to evolve, but to me, this is backwards evolution. It\u2019s like going from a lion to a pussy cat. The weird thing is for some reason I always look forward to seeing what the new COB albums will bring to the table.\n",
        "\nAfter releasing both Follow the Reaper and Hate Crew Deathroll, Children of Bodom released an album that betrayed every fan that they won over with those two classic albums. Are You Dead Yet? incorporates some new elements, but at the same time it also removes too much of what made Bodom great in the past even if it does have its share of good moments.\n\nFirst the good; Alexi's replacement is none other than Roope Latvala. He can write some really good riffs and actually performs some of the albums solos which allows for there to be three members who pull off solos on this album, which makes this release 33% more interesting than previous albums in terms of solos.\n\nWhat's also good is that the moments where the keyboards synchronize with the guitars are back and create a deeper sound than either of them alone can create. This effect was awesome on Hatebreeder and while it isn't the same effect as it was on that album, it still works. On Hatebreeder it was more of a piercing effect, while here it becomes more of a clunking sound reminiscent of industrial. I personally really like it and it's welcome here since it's one of the few elements that Bodom hasn't incorporated into their music beforehand.\n\nNow comes that bad, the keyboards are almost totally muted. While I felt that Hatebreeder was too excessive in its use of keyboards, Are you Dead Yet? barely uses them at all. Janne is an excellent keyboard player and it now feels as though he's as useful as the arms are on a T-Rex. I honestly had to turn this off after I heard the second track on here since Janne only complements the guitars during certain parts of the song rather then actually using his keyboards for either atmosphere or as an instrument. He's a great keyboardist and it's a shame that he only really gets to shine on a few tracks outside of the solos and guitar synchronization.\n\nAnother thing that irks me are the slowed down tempos. Children of Bodom made a name for themselves as a European power metal band that didn't totally suck. Sadly, this album isn't power metal at all and seems to be a cross between melodeath and groove metal. Unfortunately, both of these elements are on complete opposite ends of the spectrum. This is also problematic because groove riffs absolutely have to be catchy. The groove riffs on here for the most part suck, and aren't memorable at all. There are some exceptions but the main riff to the title track is one of the worst that I've ever heard in my life, especially coming from a band who used to write some kickass guitar parts on songs like Needled 24/7 and Deadnight Warrior. At least the solos still rule.\n\nThe drums also suck. While We\u2019re Not Gonna Fall may have a good drum beat, most of the tracks on here don\u2019t show off Jaska\u2019s obvious talents and he\u2019s usually playing simple beats whenever he isn\u2019t performing a fill. I know that he\u2019s capable of more due to his performances on Hatebreeder and Hate Crew Deathroll where he was able to pull of some amazing drum work but here he doesn\u2019t do anything that keeps my attention. Much like Janne, he\u2019s just playing on this album because he\u2019s a member of the band and Henkka\u2019s bass drives the rhythm section. I appreciate Hankka being the most important here since he\u2019s been on Something Wild, but Jaska\u2019s contributions to the band\u2019s sound are missed just as much as Janne\u2019s.\n\nThen there's the final nail in the coffin for me, Alexi's vocals. While I may not have liked the monotone and overly harsh delivery on Hatebreeder, Alexi was at least incomprehensible on there. By slowing down his singing and ennunciating more, I can finally understand half of what Alexi is saying and it's truly banal. There has always been a reason why CoB chose to omit most of the lyrics from their booklets in the past and it's now painfully obvious why. The line, \"Oh my God! You're so fine!\" in In Your Face being the most famous example. Alexi seriously should have used a less clear style of singing since I don't want to hear such poorly written lyrics that Alexi admits to improvising in the studio. He should either write his lyrics down beforehand or make his delivery as impenetrable as it usually is.\n\nThat isn't saying that Are You Dead Yet doesn't have any good moments. Living Dead Bead, In Your Face, and Trashed, Lost, and Strungout are still good songs. And some of the other tracks like Bastards of Bodom and We're Not Gonna Fall have some good moments, but most of this album is just boring and full of filler tracks. (One of which was chosen as a video over Living Dead Beat for some unknown reason.) The good tracks on this release keep it from being a total failure but it's still bad by any band's standards and thankfully they haven't released an album this bad before or since. \n\nIf you want to hear a Bodom album with groove riffs and breakdowns, listen to Blooddrunk since their at least performed well on that album. Are You Dead Yet? should only be purchased by hardcore fans who have already purchased every other album put out by the band.\n",
        "\nHatebreeder is an acquired taste. I will admit that I didn't like it the first time that I heard it, but it is an album that grows on you after a number of listens, it's just difficult to get past the excessive tendencies of this release. It may be flawed and it certainly isn't the best LP put out by Children of Bodom, but it's still worst hearing. It'll just take a few spins to actually get into.\n\nFirst off, the production is well done except for Alex's guitar which is often mixed in lower than the drums even in parts where Alexi and Janne aren't playing. Otherwise the production is just as good, if not better than most other late 90s albums. That leads to another issue that I have with the release. The production is too clean and it often doesn't feel as heavy as it needs to be in order to get as much out of this CD as the band intended. It's understandable that the band didn't want to repeat the same mistakes of Something Wild, but a harder sound to the guitars wouldn't hurt and would make Alexi's voice sound less awkward.\n\nThen there's the actual vocals, Alexi uses the harshest vocals that he ever has on here and while there are some punk-inspired vocals on here as well, Alexi just comes across as being monotonous, especially since he's never been one to annunciate while singing or publish his (improvised) lyrics. This issue combined with the production problems on here just make the entire CD sound awkward the first few times that you hear it.\n\nAs for the musicianship, it's amazing. The guitars, keyboards, and drums are all equally important to the sound of this album and each have their time to shine. Even the bass gets a cool opening part in WarHeart. This is by far the most technical CoB release and it's \n\nAs for the music, there are certainly some tracks that are better than others. Children of Bodom, Hatebreeder, WarHeart, and the almighty Downfall are much better than everything else on this album by such a large margin that it actually detracts from the quality of the other tracks on here. I will admit that there are a lot of cool parts to the other five tracks, but the aforementioned four seem to have received much more attention than the remaining tracks, which isn't surprising given that Children of Bodom and Downfall were both written before CoB entered the studio.\n\nThat isn't to say that I dislike Hatebreeder, I just feel that it is nowhere close to being the strongest album put out by CoB and isn't a good entry point to the band. It's a release that demands patience from the listener in order to appreciate and many listeners aren't willing to give it the time that it deserves, but once you truly get into it, then you'll begin to understand the hype.\n",
        "\nAfter the release of the absolutely banal Are You Dead Yet? Children of Bodom had a lot to prove to their fans with their follow up since they went from one of the world's most celebrated metal bands to one of the absolute most hated and criticized. Blooddrunk somehow redeems the band and proves that Alexi is no longer trashed, lost, and strungout on jenkem anymore.\n\nYes many of the groove riffs are still there but this time they're actually catchy and aren't overused like they were in the past which makes the album that much more enjoyable. In fact, One Day You Will Cry is almost entirely composed of groove riffs but is still one of the absolute best tracks on the album and is one of the catchiest songs that Cob has ever made.\n\nAnother thing that becomes apparent starting with the first chorus of Hellhounds On My Trail is that the keyboards are no longer as nerfed as they were on AYDY. While they aren't as prominent as they were on the first four albums, Janne has at least become a part of the band again rather than a vestigial limb and the atmosphere that he provides on the title track as well as the 8-bit video game sounds of Tie My Rope truly make all the difference on this album.\n\nOnce again, the guitars and drums are played with an incredible amount of skill and while they may not be as fast as those of Hatebreeder, they're still extremely fast and Alexi and Roope are still putting out excellent riffs and solos while Jaska's drumming is tight as ever.\n\nBlooddrunk's greatest strength is it's diversity since it's by far the most diverse album the CoB has ever put out and it has fast paced songs like Hellhounds on My Tail coexisting alongside slower songs like Banned From Heaven. Overall, it may not be Bodom's best album, but it's a huge improvement over AYDY and one of the best albums to have come out this year.\n",
        "\nHere is an album capable of alot more than it actually achieves. Every time a song feels like it's going somewhere Bodom manage to do something inexplicably irritating to ruin it, paraphrasing Lamb of God at every turn. You only need to listen to the title track to hear this, which is incredibly similar to \"Laid to rest\" from Lamb of God's \"Ashes of the wake\". The frustrating part is Children of Bodom are so much better than Lamb of God so why they feel the need to make an album that sound like the apparently inspiring Lamb of God.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the vocals; they have gone from being possibly the flaw in Bodom's music to being exceptionally irritating. It's indescribable how they are irritating but they are, grating and lacking melody, it feels like Alexi made the vocal part up on the spot.\n\nThe guitar part is under average for Bodom, here is an example of why; there is an interlude in \"Tie my rope\" around 2.05 where the guitar part plays a melody that sounds promising, Alexi however then feels it prudent to put in an unnecessary scalar part at the end in which it looses all direction thus ruining the section. This is of course one small example but for me this isolates the problem. \n\nThey seem to have attempted your Pantera style stogy riffing but with their own clever slant on it that just doesn't work. They try to do the unexpected but it comes across as half baked and erratic. This is not helped by the fact that Janne appears to have totally run out of ideas playing second rate versions of Follow the reaper's countermelodies and solos. This was the proverbial final nail in the coffin, creating an album of what is probably Bodom's pissed jamming sessions. \n\nLyrically the listener can't really expect much out of Children of Bodom and this recent offering sticks to their tradition of barely coherent swearing and generally inconsequential gibberish. However if you were looking for decent lyrics Bodom would hardly be your first port of call, so for what it's worth lyrics had nothing to do with this albums score.\n\nHaving said all that it is still Bodom so does not deserve a lower score, the album is somewhat listenable, and while irritating has occasional moments when the listener feels its coming together, though those moments are later shattered by a totally irrelevant section of music. \n\nAll musical analysis aside I would say this is a very lazy album, it seems to me that they simply couldn't be bothered to clean up all the rough edges and produce something of decent quality, those extra long hours in the studio (and large quantities of cash) it seems were not economical enough.\n\nIt's an album that that I found myself wanting to like but grasping at straws to do so. The worst album of Bodom\u2019s career so far.\n",
        "\nNo introduction necessary here, right? I mean if you\u2019re a deep fan of heavy metal, you\u2019ve definitely entered Children of Bodom\u2019s never-ending saga of flirting with the contemporary audience while trying to please their original fans, which essentially popped out \u201cAre You Dead Yet?\u201d in 2005. That particular release was, for most Children of Bodom fans, a huge letdown that clearly drove a mainstreamed agenda instead of the brutal power/speed metal apparatus like before; everything was one-dimensional, easy, foreseeable, and just plain bad. But if you got money in your wallet, plastic women at your side, midgets serving you martinis, a legion of pre-puberty brats wearing your shirts, and records selling like hotcakes, then why stop? When forced to choose between loyalty and bunking with the \u201chella tight,\u201d these low-voltage goons took \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d down into their abyss of popular crap, only leaving a developing legacy in ashes. The metal that once gave Lake Bodom essence now stands deserted with decay all around, and temptation\u2019s hazards pollute all that wish for survival; this is the world of \u201cBlooddrunk.\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s the entire album in a can: unmemorable speed metal occupying a strong presence of Pantera-laden instrumentation and constant repetition. Roope Latvala and the ever-so-infamous Alexi Laiho are given the irksome honor of pestering their fans beyond words when they snuggle with groove licks, ceaseless identicalness in their overall style, forgettable solos, and speed chops lurking amongst the generic. As for percussion, Jaska Raatikainen seems trapped by Laiho\u2019s large ego, as he\u2019s forbidden from performing fills, tom rolls, or anything potentially reviving toward Children of Bodom\u2019s murmuring heart. Sure they still practice those semi-sweet keyboards that ironically act as the band\u2019s only sense of identity, but what difference does it make overall? All remaining qualities have the lifeless signs of modernization, and tossing in funky chimes leaves little effect steaming from the final product when observing \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d wholly.\n\nTo make matters worse, Alexi Laiho\u2019s yippy-dog barks now appear even worse than before, mainly because the overblown production puts his awful screams in charge of this musical charade, but doing so also allows our unfortunate listeners to experience the comedic gold within those stupid lyrics. Songs like \u201cLoBodomy\u201d portray stapler-meets-forehead retardation at its absolute worst while emitting illogical profanities only an angry teenager could write; truly an immature gesture that\u2019s felt here entirely. I guess viewing the downfall of occasional excellence leaves one nasty mark that just can\u2019t be ignored, and aside from Janne\u2019s keyboards, there\u2019s only filth for us to loathe until our hearts realize the obvious truth: these bastards just flushed forty minutes down the drain.\n\nFrankly, this album has more holes in it than a package of rat-infested cheese, yet unlike their previous effort, there isn\u2019t a single moment worth mentioning. It really hurts to see Children of Bodom accepting their status as a \u201cme-too\u201d band, but that\u2019s exactly what they wanted; if not, \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d wouldn\u2019t be such a horrendous pile of simple, predictable garbage, and you could bet your zesty ass these clowns knew what audience would sacrifice a few bucks for this sub-par offering. Unless you\u2019ve received a LoBodomy (that\u2019s actually clever), avoid \u201cBlooddrunk\u201d at all costs, because it\u2019s just one of those albums you\u2019ll end up hating regardless of what your metallic tongue desires.\n\nThis review was written for: www.leviatan-magazine.com\n",
        "\nI grabbed Blooddrunk as soon as it leaked, hoping the band recovered from the generic chugfest that was \"Are You Dead Yet?\" The first track: \"Hellhounds On My Trail\" gave me plenty of hope. The mere presence of the fabled orchestra hit within the first 10 seconds brought back waves of memories from the Hatebreeder era. Initial consensus was pretty good, Alexi's vocals still suck, but Janne Warman isn't underutilized like he was on the previous release, and the unconventional Slayer-esque solo is really enjoyable; a great track.\n\nThen comes the \"single\", the title track, and everything goes downhill. Minus the catchy opening keyboard riff that is repeated throughout the song, I find trouble remembering absolutely any part of it. Sad thing is, that trend continues for almost the entirety of the album. It just seems like the band is going through the motions, and even after THREE years the material still seems rushed. We all know how skilled a drummer Jaska is, but he just plods through this album doing absolutely nothing interesting. Hennka is barely audible, and Roope has yet to do anything worth noting since he teamed up with Alexi to create this \"Dream Team\" of Finnish guitar virtuosos.\n\nThat leaves Alexi and Janne. Janne's keys are the lone bright spot of this release, after being wholly wasted on AYDY?. Tons of ripping solos are the order of the day, making boring songs: \"Lobodomy\" worth listening to. It should also be noted that \"Smile Pretty For The Devil\" has the best keyboard solo since the Hatecrew Deathroll days, love it.\n\nAlexi's playing is staggered and similar in function and form to their previous release. Even the solos seem tethered to some kind of invisible chain that has plagued Mr. Laiho for the past 3 years. His vocals continue to decline, reaching new depths with almost Hetfield-like \"Yeaheahhhhs\" at times. My God how the mighty have fallen.\n\nKalmah's upcoming release is sure to knock heads off, Children of Bodom is merely an afterthought nowadays. Never thought I'd say that.\n",
        "\nIn my Something Wild review, I stated that nothing that Children of Bodom released afterwards was worth listening to. I\u2019ve retracted my statement after relistening to Hatebreeder a few more times, because even though that album\u2019s production sucks compared to the raw intensity of SW and the songs are basically rehashed, it still provides an entertaining listen. That concession, however, will be my last, as everything else they\u2019ve put out is basically shit. \n\nFollow the Reaper is the first good example of Bodom\u2019s innovative bankruptcy (Hatebreeder was an example, but again, could still be listened to). Outside of \u201cChildren of Decadence,\u201d which relies more on atmosphere than their compositions generally do, there are no original ideas to be found here. If Hatebreeder was Something Wild rehashed, this is Hatebreeder rehashed, but slowed down. Alexi\u2019s leadwork is improved (it improves every album), but his writing is boring, almost to the point where one could consider him the Yngwie Malmsteen of his generation in that regards. The keyboards still enhance the band\u2019s work (christ, imagine how bland this would be if they were removed!), but they\u2019re basically a novelty at this point, being completely predictable in execution. And now that the band isn\u2019t writing fast songs, the drumming is fucking boring too.\n\nLet\u2019s see, what else. Alexi\u2019s vocal delivery is passionless, the lyrics are dumb, and all the songs have the same riffs. If this is the first Bodom album you get, I can understand how you\u2019d enjoy it. But with the knowledge that it\u2019s just a retreading of better material from their earlier albums (as well as who knows how many classical pieces), it loses all integrity. And the albums after this are even worse. The only thing worth listening to here is the guitar solos.\n\nImagine if Alexi had actually succeeded in killing himself after Something Wild. Bodom\u2019s reputation might have been legendary\u2026\n",
        "\nHere Children of Bodom seem to repeat the good ol' blueprint of a CoB-single: The single and a coversong as B-side. This time, it comes out rather well actually. \n\nThe title track sounds, in some ways, like a new Living Dead Beat, but has some keyboard/guitar passages and group shouts that seem to take you back to the good old Hatebreeder days. It didn't appeal to me the first time I heard it, but after having listened to it a couple of times I've grown to like it more (at least more than Are You Dead Yet?).\n\nThe B-side, however, is where the real fun begins! This time Children of Bodom have chosen to cover a song by American blues/folk/rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival, 'Lookin' Out My Back Door'. Since I am, and have always been, a big fan of CCR, I had my fears that this would desecrate a great piece of music. \nLuckily I was mistaken, since this is a fast, furious, heavy, catchy and, dare I say, incredibly fun cover song. Laiho provides his typical harsh vocal, but without ruining the country feel of the song. Combined with both banjo and a happy honky tonk like piano (wtf?!) this proves to be Children of Bodoms best cover since Somebody Put Something in My Drink. This really is a song you'll want to get up and jump around to!\n\nWhile this doesn't necessarily signify a return to arms after the pretty boring Are You Dead Yet?, it does come off as a good start, and here's to hoping Children of Bodom will return to the music they played so well on their first albums.\nAnyhow this single is definitely worth the 4 bucks I payed for it (weirdly cheap, actually...), mainly because of the great CCR cover, which totally overshadows the more mediocre Blooddrunk.\n",
        "\nI've loved Children of Bodom for years, I even defended Are You Dead Yet? because it still caught my attention and gave me hope of a comeback. This album has pretty much put the last nail in the coffin for me. I'll just a quick rundown on a few of the songs that make this release from a once incredible band a terrible turn down the wrong path.\n\nHellbounds On My Trails: The song kicks off with Alexi doing a really fast but upbeat kind of trem picking riff and then uses the same rhythm and momentum to go in to a simpler version of the riff. Normally I'd have no problem with this but there is almost no riff variation from there for about 2 minutes. There is a \"chorus\" in there somewhere but it was so weak almost didn't even notice the difference. The solo is good as Alexi usually delivers but is way too short. Same goes with Janne as his key solo is more of a fill than anything. It's like they've decided to completely throw out the idea of developing anything and are doing just what every other band out there is and finding a \"cool\" riff, sitting on it for 4 minutes and calling it a song.\n\nBlooddrunk: Being the title track you'd think it would be somewhat decent right? Wrong. Again they just sit on the same riff for about 4 minutes and don't go anywhere. The solo is actually very good in this song (again short though) which is one redeeming factor. Also for a few seconds the keys do kick in and stray a little from the guitar.\n\nOne Day You Will Cry: I am sorry to say but it really does sound like Angels Don't Kill. The intro synth work is EXACTLY the same. Its got about the same song structure as well. this song disappointed me because they aren't just doing tried methods now, they're ripping themselves off. I did like the solos in this song however.\n\nBasically this whole album is a bunch of tried methods and a collection of \"cool\" riffs. Where did the melodies go? Janne must have stopped writing or something because he strayed from the guitar line maybe three times in the album excluding solos. Its as if Alexi has decided to stop playing melodically entirely and just decided to play what all the teeny-boppers will bang their heads to. All of the riffs on the album are just fast-paced bang your head riffs, which there is nothing wrong with necessarily but it is NOT what I expect from CoB. I believe this band has already turned their heads down the path of money-making, popularity machine and waved goodbye to anything they used to be known for. I give this a 29 because at least the soloing is still there.\n",
        "\nEvery now and then an album comes along that makes you stop and play it again, just to be sure that it is as good on the second listen as it was on the first. \"Follow the Reaper\" is one of those albums. Its not flawless, but there are no weak or filler tracks and certainly no indication of the change in style that Children of Bodom underwent after this release.\n\n\"Follow the Reaper,\" like Children of Bodom's prior releases is a speed metal/power metal hybrid with black metal, sometimes blackened death vocals. Keyboards are used not only to create the dark atmosphere of the album, but also for solos, sometimes dueling with the lead guitar. \n\n\"Follow the Reaper\" goes full out, balls-to-the-wall right from the start. After a brief (9 seconds) spoken word intro, the title track immediately kicks off with the keyboards and an infectious riff that draws you in. From there to the end of the album, the fantastic guitarwork and the keyboards create a sound that both defines and is defined by Children of Bodom.\n\nBy far the spotlight of this album is the solos. Mini solos and full fledged solos abound, in every song. My personal favorites are the solo near the end of 'Kissing the Shadows' and the one in the title track. Regardless of which song or where in the song the solos are, Laiho's skill consistently shines, leaving the solos both blisteringly fast and catchy. You'll find yourself backtracking just to hear some of them one more time. Thats not to say that other bands don't have infectious, blazing solos- its just something about the frenetic way Laiho attacks the guitar combined with the accompanying keyboards and the equally frenetic drumming and *gasp* audible bass parts.\n\nAside from the solos, the general musicianship is tight. The drumming is good and not overdone, the bass can be heard and contributes greatly, and the keyboards sync quite nicely with the guitars.\n\nThe vocal style fits quite well with the music. Laiho's relatively distinct, high pitched raspy growls and shrieks compliment the blazing music it accompanies. The lyrics for the most part are kind of silly, but then again Children of Bodom (and most metal in general) really isn't known for the greatest or most poetic lyrics you'll ever hear, and it certainly doesn't detract from the greatness of the CD. MY only real complaint with this album, however, is that Laiho doesn't have the power behind his vocals that some other metal vocalists- its not that they sound weak, its just that sometimes it seems that they are a little strained. \n\nAs a entire cohesive unit, all aspects come together and form what is one of the most enjoyable, I dare say fun, metal albums I have ever heard. There are no real weak spots, and the minor ones that are present are almost negligable when compared to the album as a whole. Truly, this is the pinnacle of Children of Bodom's career- marginally better than Hatebreeder (Laiho's vocals seem to be a little better on this album than on Hatebreeder) and miles better than \"Are you dead yet?\" and \"Hate crew Deathroll.\"\n",
        "\nI figured I should get through all of the Bodom albums, so here goes my second favorite, behind only the flawless Follow the Reaper, Hatebreeder. This was Bodom back in their heyday, in their prime so to speak. The follow up is a bit better, catapulting it to stratospheric proportions, but this one is just about to break out of Earth's atmosphere, just not quite there.\n\nThis is the album where the neoclassical style was the most prevalent, and the songwriting was still top notch. I've heard somebody describe this album as a collection ridiculously overblown novelty songs, and I can kind of see where he was going with that comment, but he also just hates Bodom in general. If you dislike this band to start with, there are two courses of action. You either go in and hope that they actually were good before their last two abortions that some people call albums, or you go in convinced that they were always shitty and so you look for things to call out. I don't think these are ridiculous novelties, but a huge Suffocation or Nile fan might think so, so it all boils down to your previous opinion for the most part (I'm assuming every metalhead on the planet has heard of Bodom).\n\nEvery band member is at almost their peak, a summit which everybody would reach with the next album, the only difference is that the drumming seems more intense here. It is mostly just simple double bass beats (although there is the occasional blast), but it's a hell of a lot more intense on this album. The leads/melodies/riffs/solos are phenomenal as usual on both the guitar and keys. The bass never really has any standout parts, usually following the rhythm guitar (barring certain sections of Downfall). The vocals are still indecipherable, but that's a good thing considering Alexi is the worst lyricist in metal. Janne's keys are used the best on this album from a player's viewpoint. I prefer his performance on Follow the Reaper, but here he is actually able to use them as an instrument (like he did on FtR), but he also creates excellent atmosphere. Most bands with a keyboardist tend to use him for just big hits and atmosphere, few use it as an instrument, this is the album where Wirman is able to do both flawlessly.\n\nThe album opens with Warheart, a fantastic speed filled monster, and the album never slows down for the most part. Bed of Razors isn't quite as unrelenting as fast as Silent Night, Bodom Night, but it is still a fantastic and nearly perfect song. Hatebreeder as an album has a few songs that aren't quite as heavy as what they would later write, but it's hard to knock them down a notch.\n\nIn fact the only song that isn't amazing is Wrath Within, starting off in a style that we would all unfortunately become very well acquainted with later down the road (Trashed, Lost, and Strungout nearly steals that opening riff). Luckily, the song gets back into the late nineties Bodom sound soon afterwards, but the intro takes the song down a bit, and it's the only song that isn't quite memorable. I can't recall parts from it from memory, whereas I can probably sing/air guitar the entirety of Downfall with no provocation to do so. It's like whatever magic they are usually working just fell a bit short on this song. Otherwise the entire album is great.\n\nSeeing Bodom live has made me decide that Downfall is pretty much the coolest closer to any album/show I've ever witnessed. The suspense it builds in the beginning is breathtaking. Children of Bodom as one of the most party-tastic final minutes of any song I've ever heard outside of Motorhead. It's kind of hard to explain, but once you hear it you'll understand. Most of the riffs are extremely fast, tremolo picked patterns with bits of neoclassical shred thrown at the end. I mean that, there are leads at the end of the fucking RIFFS, that's nuts. Silent Night, Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, and Towards Dead End are good examples of what I'm saying. Not to mention Alexi actually plays those really complicated leads whilst singing, I've said it before and I'll say it again, it's not a studio trick, I've seen him pull it off live.\n\nThis is a review that's hard to write for me, because Hatebreeder really is an album that you have to hear to understand. Judging by the mixed reviews here, I wouldn't recommend buying it until you've at least heard it once because it is definitely different. If you're an old school Bodom fan, chances are you probably have this, and if you haven't it's pretty much the same style as Something Wild and Follow the Reaper. A well deserved A+ to the Finnish shredders for back before they sucked. They are really comparable to Metallica from a philosophical standpoint. Their fourth album got them mainstream attention, the fifth album WAS mainstream, and the sixth was a large pile of commercial shit. Therefore, Hatebreeder can be considered Bodom's Ride the Lightning. An excellent album from back when they actually wrote good music.\n",
        "\nSo here we have it, Bodom's latest album - and it only seems like yesterday that \"Are You Dead Yet\" was released. A lot of people have complained about that album and a lot of what people have said is true. Indeed, Bodom have rapidly turned more commercial in both music and image over the last few years but I've never seen \"commercial\" as a bad thing, providing the music still has attributes that grab my attention and keep me listening....\n\nThis album, however, does not. That vertically challenged wimp and his chronies have decided to stray further from their roots than ever before, and this time they've sent their catchy melodies packing in such a bad way that I'm doubting they'll ever come back from fear of being butchered into something many of us don't recognise as being music. Take \"Hellbounds on my trail\" for example. We'd expect a catchy chorus lead and some powerful rhythm behind it, as the usual Bodom formula would dictate, but what we have here is a lead melody that sounds so ill (in a bad way) I'm surprised it survived til the end of the chorus. I couldn't possibly think of a way to make this riff worse.\n\nWell, that's one riff, but things get even worse. The title track \"Blooddrunk\" has a nice solo but other than that it plods along going entirely nowhere. The third track \"Lobodomy\" is composed of boring thrash riffs, except one part at 02:14 which sounds like something from one of their older albums, and I'm sure it is - but knowing I've heard it somewhere before makes it evident that it is nothing original. \n\nYou know when you find an album with a few good tracks on it, and then the rest of the tracks are painfully mediocre? Imagine that without the good tracks, and you've got \"Blooddrunk\". There's nothing really interesting to say about the other songs on the album aside from that they're composed of overused generic powerchord thrash riffs and keyboards that just follow the guitars instead of straying from them and doing something interesting like in previous Bodom albums. I'd be surprised if Bodom could churn out another album after this one. It serves as evidence that Bodom are running out of ideas quickly and losing that once great, catchy, impressive sound they once graced us with.\n\n16% for two reasons - The chorus of \"Smile Pretty for The Devil\" is okay, and secondly because they showed one sign of their original style as I mentioned above. I'm not sure I should get my hopes up for the next album though...\n",
        "\nAfter ripping their two latest albums to shreds, I decided I needed to remind myself why I ever loved Bodom in the first place. So, I popped in one of my favorite albums of all time, and let it kick my ass. Holy god, anybody interested should definitely check this out first, and if you are hailing Are You Dead Yet? or Blooddrunk as masterpieces, then chances are you've never heard Follow the Reaper.\n\nIt's been said before, but I'll say it again, Bodom has fallen into a very large pile of shit as of late. The last few albums have been boring, uncreative, plodding, unambitious, and just downright bad. They dumbed down their previously unique sound to cater to the dumber crowd because there was more money in it that way. If that's not how the band sees it, then they are either lying to themselves, or they've honestly decided that it is better for them, as musicians, to devolve. When one looks back though, they see brilliance. The first album is mindblowing, the next is even better. Hate Crew Deathroll is a step in a simpler direction, but it was still undeniably Bodom. In the middle of all that, there was their crowning achievement, 2001's Follow the Reaper.\n\nAll the technicality, songwriting, and catchiness of Hatebreeder has carried over, and yet the band managed to one up themselves once again. The songs are faster, louder, more bombastic, and just overall better. That is a shocking achievement as well, because Hatebreeder is a timeless classic... and that should really show how great Follow the Reaper is. The lyrics are still dumb as hell, but this was back when the music was so captivating you didn't care (it also helped that he screamed pretty non coherently back then). I also find it funny that only a few songs have the lyrics in the booklet (that's because Alexi has a habit of not even writing lyrics, and just makes them up on the spot in the studio). The parenthesized statement was actually a decent excuse for the bullshit lyrics back then, but now they have a budget equivalent to that of the newest Lord of the Rings film, so there is no way they are rushed anymore.\n\nThis was the shining moment of every members' career, barring maybe Jaska. The drumming was a tad better on Hatebreeder I think, but everything else is a step up. The guitar, bass, vocals, and keys are all a smidge bit better than the previous outing. The solos on both instruments are all insane, and I'm still baffled that Laiho can sing and play those complex melodies/leads at the same time (it's not a studio trick either, I've seen them live twice). The keys are only reduced to playing atmosphere a couple of times, for the most part they are used as an instrument, playing leads and solos.\n\nAs for the individual tracks, none suck.... wow...... none suck. I never know what the score for an album is going to be before I write a review, as I usually write it and then input the individual scores to calculate the average at the end, but when I was thinking of what the weakest track would be, I realized that there isn't one. Every last track is flawless. Each with catchy riffs and melodies, not to mention mind blowing solos from back when Alexi and Janne used to shred like their lives depended on it. I was going to cite Taste of My Scythe as the worst track, but in listening, there is nothing wrong with it. It is just as good as Northern Comfort or Every Time I Die. I guess the three aforementioned songs aren't as good as the rest, but they are still perfect tens. It just means that Follow the Reaper, Bodom after Midnight, Children of Decadence, Mask of Sanity, Hate Me! and Kissing the Shadows are like.... 12/10.\n\nI guess the best of the best would be Kissing the Shadows. The whole last minute is a sweeping shredfest that actually compliments the music perfectly, it doesn't come off as wanky. Mask of Sanity is also a standout for the extreme catchiness and bindblowing solos. I guess you can just take that last sentence and replace the song title with any of the first three, and it is perfectly applicable.\n\nSee, this album is proof that I am not just a Bodom hater. May last few reviews have actually garnered some hate mail, and I felt like my fandom was being called into question. I was going to review this anyways (as I'm going to eventually review every album I have), but I moved it to the top of the list after my latest shitstorm, and actually surprised myself with just how amazing this actually is. I thought Taste of My Scythe or Northern Comfort would drag it down just a teensy bit, and end up with a 96 or something in the end, but as I listened to it trying to remember what I didn't like about them, I was treated with memorable, catchy, fast, and impressive songs. Every last song is perfect.\n\nWell, this is my second 100, and my first for a full album. Nuns Have No Fun got a perfect score, but it only had four tracks, which probably helped. Children of Bodom actually managed to write a full length album with no weak spots. No dips in quality, no nothing. I absolutely love everything about this album, and it deserves all of the praise it gets. I wasn't joking when I said it is one of my top 10 favorite albums of all time.\n\nFans of the newer stuff should check this out only so they know what they are missing, and what the band used to be capable of. Fans of the older stuff should already have it, so just crank it really loud or something. Fans who are new to Bodom and are trying to find a good place to start.... well, it's not a coincidence that this is the most reviewed and highest rated Bodom albums on the site. Truly a classic.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom, such a fall from grace.... this band held so much promise when I first heard them around the Hate Crew era, and they actually were a very large reason that my taste developed towards the more extreme style. Follow the Reaper and Hatebreeder are both absolute classics, no doubt about it, I'd even possibly rank the former in my top 10 favorite metal albums ever.\n\nSo what happened? Why the low rating? Because this is Hate Crew Dead Yet? You can take either of the last two albums, slap Part 2 on the end and describe this album perfectly. Why is that bad? I obviously liked Hate Crew Deathroll, but how would you have felt if Judas Priest had released Screaming for Vengeance or British Steel over and over again? They weren't bad albums, but they were stripped/dumbed down for a more mainstream audience and are some of the band's most accessible/popular records, as is Hate Crew or Are You Dead Yet? for Children of Bodom. This album is not terrible, per se, but it is the final nail in the coffin for them to me. They have completely abandoned the beauty, technicality, catchiness, songwriting, and just that... that essence they had back in the late nineties for a more simplistic style that is easier for these Hot Topic shopping mouth breathers that are for some reason seen as the next generation for metal. These dopey twats also love Marilyn Manson. As soon as a band finds themselves catering to Marilyn fucking Manson fans, they need to step back, reevaluate why they chose metal over everything else, and either publicly admit that they have completely abandoned their old fans, kill themselves, or kick everybody in the nuts and decide to go back to kicking ass. This band did neither of the three.\n\nThe album starts with Hellhounds on my Trail, which sounds okay, but it just makes you wonder if this is really the same band that wrote Bed of Razors. Where is the fury? It's fucking gone! The opening track seems like a stripped down version of one of the lamer tracks from Hate Crew, as does One Day You Will Cry (which is almost a carbon copy of Chokehold (Cocked and Loaded)). What is up with this groove bullshit the band has fallen into? I swear to god the verse riff from the title track could easily be a Lamb of God throwaway. Also, I swear I've heard the main riff for Smile Pretty for the Devil (by the way, they have never been good with song titles, but this is no longer hilarious, it is now insulting) somewhere on Are You Dead Yet? And is that Now You've Got Something to Die For I hear in the breaks?\n\nThe solos... well, they are still okay. They can't touch what they used to be, but you can't expect a band to constantly rip out awesomeness throughout the duration of their career... but it kind of sounds like Alexi is just going through the motions now that he noticed that fanboys will worship the ground he walks on if he played Twinkle Twinlke Little Star. Also, is Janne Wirman even in the band anymore? You only hear him about once a song now. What happened to all of the cool runs from Towards Dead End? Children of Decadence? Downfall? Mask of Sanity? Lake Bodom? What the hell happened? He doesn't even play mind blowing parts anymore, he's just there for atmosphere now.\n\nThis album is giving me a headache, Tie My Rope sounds just like In Your Face from the last album. Why are people hailing this garbage as masterful? Done with Everything, Die for Nothing... another typical song. This one actually could be great, but the same problem that's been plaguing the first batch is here as well, and that is Jaska. It's like he either forgot how to play, got too old and/or feeble from drinking and can now only double bass for twelve seconds at a time, or the band is telling him to chill out and be boring every time he starts reminding us old fans why we used to love the band so much. Seriously, the break before the solos in the title track has potential, but after the snare hits, he just descends into a super simple and super slow beat that even I could learn in a matter of seconds.\n\nNow, the worst track on the album, and the worst Bodom song ever recorded.... Banned from Heaven. I can sum up this song with simply Angels Don't Kill part II. They somehow took the formula from that inexplicably popular shit burger of a song and beat it against the rocks until you could no longer count the fragments of skull bashed all over the shore. This song is plodding, boring, annoying, overlong (and it's only five minutes), and just goes nowhere. I am 100% serious when I say that I've heard better Devildriver songs.\n\nThe closer doesn't sound like a closer at all, it just kind of starts and just goes without any of the magic their previous closers have had. That's not the reason I'm marking this song down though, that would be foolish. I'm slagging it because it sounds exactly like all of the rest of the songs from this god awful turd from a once mighty band. That said though, it is definitely one of the few strong tracks on Blooddrunk.\n\nI will say this though, the obligatory \"Bodom\" track this time 'round has not only one of the funnier names in metal (LoBodomy), but it is actually the best song here. It sounds, once again, like it could've been on Hate Crew, but it sounds like it would've been like Sixpounder instead of Bodom Beach Terror, that is, it would've been one of the best songs on the album as opposed to one of the mediocre ones. \n\nI decided to download the leak instead of actually buying this one because I really wasn't impressed with the promos I'd heard (Blooddrunk, Tie My Rope, and Banned from Heaven), and because these reviews on the site were just fishy. There is no way the rest of the album is good enough to constitute scores in the nineties when those three tracks were so terrible.\n\nSo there is my two cents, a 27%, and it would've been lower if LoBodomy wasn't actually good. So yeah, this album is a festering turd that has for some reason been praised heavily so far. I hope people who aren't fanboys review this soon enough, because this is honestly a horrible record. I used to love this band, but is a very large turd, I honestly wish death upon it.\n\nOne of the most disappointing falls from grace yet witnessed in the metal world. I turned on Children of Decadence afterwards, and I could actually feel my headache rescinding. Wonderful feeling.\n\nBut yeah..... big fat piece of shit.\n",
        "\nNow, Children of Bodom has lately established themselves as one of the most popular metal bands on the planet, an accomplishment that inevitably irked dedicated metal fnas worldwide. Their last few albums featured much more mainstream song-writing than their early efforts, leaving many old fans skeptical about the direction Children of Bodom would take on \"Blooddrunk\".\n\nThe question arose: would Children of Bodom write and album showing a return to form or an album for Billboard charts?\n\nWell, the answer is that they seemed to have a found a happy medium on \"Blooddrunk\".\n\nThe industrial overtones present throughout \"Are You Dead Yet?\" are still very present on \"Blooddrunk\" as are the catchy chorus song structures. However, the overall feel of the album is more akin to thrash metal than their previous experiments with power metal and traditional/heavy metal asthetics.\n\nThe instruments are all played exceptionally well throughout the effort, something we've come to expect of Children of Bodom. The lead guitar work and vocals of Alexi Laiho are as fantastic-sounding as ever, but tend to grow stale over the course of the album. There are a lot of cases where you will happen upon riffs and solos that you could have sworn you have heard a million times before on Children of Bodom's past albums. Still, a few melodic gems can be found on the album, such as sections of the the album's title track. I'd sum up the overall feel of the vocals with the word \"monotony\", but he has never been known for his vocal range or technicallity.\n\nChildren of Bodom's rhythm section has always been phenomenal, and the performance on this album is no exception. Rhythm axe-man Roope Latvala once again demonstrates his technical prowess, holding down faster riffs than ever. Why they let Alexi play lead instead of Roope, I'll never know. The drumming of Jaska Raatikainen has evolved to include more technical metal elements such as prominent blast-beats and double bass passages, but still retains the legions of interesting fills that makes him stand out in my mind. Henkka \"Blacksmith\" is another excellent player lost in the mix, save for a few well-executed bass passages.\n\nSo, with all this criticism of mixing and organization problems, why did I feel the album deserved such a high score? Two words: Janne Wirman. Somehow, this man manages to use the keyboards to turn a fairly typical album into something fresh and interesting. From the opening passages of \"Tie My Rope\" and \"Blooddrunk\" to the increased use of prominent keyboard presence found throughout the album, Wirman shows once again why he is one of metal's most revered keyboardists. The evolution he displays here is amazing in itself. The odd keyboard structures in tracks like \"Banned From Heaven\" are absolutely stellar. \n\nSo, the final verdict? Children of Bodom explores all possible meanings of \"If it's not broke, don't fix it\" on this album, which sometimes results in repetitive and indistinct songs. Improved elements such as more professional \"gang shouts\" and the growth in the band's use of keyboards in their writing more than balance out the negative aspects of the album though, in my opinion.\n\nThis is the album you want if you're a Children of Bodom fan (or even just a general thrash metal fan) who is looking for a more keyboard-driven album than their past work.\n\nStand-out tracks include the title track and \"One Day You Will Cry\".\n",
        "\nReputations are funny. Everyone seems to hate this band nowadays, but when you take a step back and look at things from a different point of view, you start to wonder how many of them have actually sat down and listened to Children of Bodom. I'm not going to claim that every bit of criticism against them is unjustified, as surely there are many things one can dislike about this band - from the stupid lyrics to the overly flashy musicianship (and sometimes lackluster songwriting) to the blackened yowl of Alexi Laiho's vocal terrorism on the mic; all \"love or hate\" sort of things - but a good deal of the shit being flung at Children of Bodom is due to the fact that their new albums more or less suck, and the general immature and juvenile image the band and their fans project. So they've pretty much dug themselves into a rut these days, as they now only make boring music and have a shitty, repulsive reputation that would likely ward off any curious newcomers (or even old fans) akin to the manner in which a flaming pile of dog feces would ward off an elderly couple on Halloween.\n\nHowever, disregarding any pretenses one might have about Children of Bodom or Alexi Laiho, Follow the Reaper remains a quality album, albeit an overrated one by many. It has all the Children of Bodom trademarks, including the bat-shit insane, soaring lead guitar lines, the fluttery, hyper-melodic Power Metal synths, the hard-hitting, borderline thrashy riffs that come at you like fireballs from an apocalyptic sky, and of course Alexi's signature blackened screech, which you will either love or hate. Personally, I've always thought that a clean vocalist would make this band a lot less garishly unique, sort of killing the whole \"freak show\" vibe their music has about it, and if they started using clean vocals, they wouldn't stand out at all amongst titanic monoliths like Angra, Pagan's Mind or Hibria. The harsh vocals might be grating, but they go surprisingly well with the frenetic storm of melodies that the music thunders forth with. Who the hell really wants to hear these lyrics sung by clean vocals, anyway? The musicians here are all talented out the ass, though, every single one of them, and it makes this album a pleasure to listen to. It's mostly ear candy, yes, but it is very enjoyable music, and that is all that matters in the end.\n\nThe individual songs on this album are all fast and fun, with only the stomping, ominous \"Every Time I Die\" slowing down the tempo a bit. Standouts include the opening volley of the title track, which is more or less a perfect initiation to Children of Bodom to a new listener with it's furious leads stacking on top of one another and the synths blaring away like the sirens of Hell in the background, the positively evil \"Hate Me!\" with it's throat-tearing leadwork and those creepy horror movie synths opening and ending the song, and the fantastic \"Kissing the Shadows,\" which is probably the best song they ever wrote, standing head and shoulders above any song they've written since with a plethora of galloping riffs and luscious solos that will set you aflame. A downside is that a few of the tracks run together here and aren't as memorable, but even those have deliciously cool solos aplenty around every corner, so it's not as big of a deal as it would be otherwise.\n\nWhat I like best about Follow the Reaper, though, is the fact that it's more fun than a barrel full of monkeys, and then some. Compulsively listenable and with energy to boot, Children of Bodom have created an album that is both technically proficient and completely zany and enjoyable all the same, which is more than I can say for other instrumental wishing wells like Dream Theater, who haven't done anything exciting or enjoyable in years. Who cares if their lyrics suck without exception? Who the fuck cares if Children of Bodom wank a bit too much at times? They've written a collection of head-bashingly enjoyable songs with some of the coolest and most colorful melodies I've heard in ages, and if you like high-speed melodic Metal of any sort, then this album should already be on your shelf. Worthy.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nI never did really like Children of Bodom. I always wrote them off as another overhyped, undertalented byproduct of the modern metal movement. But then I heard Something Wild and, try as I might, I can\u2019t help but enjoy the damn thing. Here on their debut, their unique OTT brand of extremist power metal is fresh and uncompromised by the growing popularity that would trendify their later work. Here everything is insane, but well-placed, leading to a product that is, for lack of a better phrase, truly something wild.\n\nThe primary pack-separating aspect of this band is their extreme take on what would otherwise be standard \u2018ol melodic power metal in the vein of Stratovarius. They demonstrate this in several ways. Firstly, the drumming is uncharacteristically intense, incorporating blast beats into power metal in a manner that would not be again attempted until Dragonforce did it half a decade later. This, coupled with the heavily distorted guitars, has even led some to go as far as to call this thrash metal. While it\u2019s not even close, that is the kind of sonic intensity this calls forth, even on the jaded listener. Secondly, and much more noticeably, is frontman Alexi Laiho\u2019s vocal performance, which is one of the band\u2019s defining aspects. No soaring falsetto or catchy melodies to be found here: Laiho utilizes a raspy roar that would be much more at home in the realm of black metal, but it grows on you as the album progresses. Thirdly, elaborating on my last assertion, there are no catchy VOCAL melodies to be found on the album. Guitar melodies are an entirely different story, as Laiho\u2019s Bach-inspired guitar work, while not quite at the level of say Michael Romeo, is nonetheless pleasing to the ears, serving as a unique contrast to his harsh vocals. Lastly, there are full-time keyboards at work here, at times similar to the way they are utilized in Sonata Arctica (must be a Finnish thing). Of course the context is entirely different due to the band\u2019s sound, but they add immensely to the album atmospherically (as keyboards often do) and serve to enhance the guitar melodies rather than compete with them the way they do in Malmsteen\u2019s work (though these guys do imitate Malmsteen at times). There\u2019s a fair amount of interesting breaks involved as well to add even more variety to the compositions. To be fair, the orchestra hit sound gets somewhat annoying (this isn\u2019t the Mortal Kombat soundtrack, after all), but the various string, choir, and harpsichord synths are more than welcome.\n\nStructurally, the songs are just as over-the-top as the music itself. What the music lacks in abrupt time signature changes and overtly progressive elements it makes up for in non-cyclical riff progressions. Rarely does it seem that these guys adhere to traditional song arrangements, choosing to just add riff upon riff, seasoned with leads and interludes, until the song\u2019s end. In a way, this further affect the band\u2019s catchiness, already impeded by the rough vocals, but it\u2019s only a problem if you see it as one. \n\nThe only problem I can really find with this album, aside from the occasional lack of catchiness, is the lyrics, which were supposedly mostly improvised at recording time. It shows: there\u2019s nothing here worth repeating and at times it\u2019s even a bit embarrassing. But since the words are mostly indistinguishable anyway (aside from the chorus of the first part of \u201cRed Light in my Eyes\u201d), it\u2019s hardly a scratch on the surface of an otherwise fantastic debut. Shame they couldn\u2019t keep up the pace they set on here, as their future releases merely shadow this one. Ah well, they gave us one classic, that\u2019s enough for me.\n\nHighlights: \u201cDeadnight Warrior,\u201d \u201cLake Bodom\u201d\n",
        "\nBoring Bodom? Never thought I'd say it, but that is pretty much what this is. After back records such as the blistering \"Hatebreeder\" and the brilliantly well-written and colourful \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" (have not heard \"Follow the Reaper\") this is exactly not what I wanted to hear. Modernized, over-produced, slower, cheesier (yes, it's possible) CoB. \n\nThe whole album is very similar. Whereas HCD flourished in its brilliant melodies, upbeat choruses and manic solos, AYDY pretty much flattens this all out into basic CoB material. Very thick production, quite the opposite to past Bodom which was crisp and discernable, definitely achieves what they Hatecrew were aiming for in a heavier album - more commercial as well. This is not always a bad thing, but in CoB's case it certainly is. The vocals have got quite a lot thicker as well, less harsh and in your face than the previous album (ironic as I\u2019ve just noticed that one of the tracks is called \u201cIn Your Face\u201d).\n\nAgreeably, this all sounds pretty negative at the moment. However, the keyboard is (thankfully) still as brilliant as ever, with lots of great little touches. The guitar is technically proficient, but not as much as normal. This is definitely a let down on the whole, but it is extremely impressive when it really gets going. A good example is the solo on the outright highlight of the album \"If You Want Peace... Prepare For War\". This track is a real blast, neck breaking through and through, a top of the range CoB track. One of the only ones, mind. Other exceptions are about two in the middle of the album, the rest is filler material.\n\nAvoid this album unless you are a die-hard Bodom fan.\n",
        "\nYears ago I was a littlebit over-enthusiastic when it comes to buying records, so after just seeing the videoclip for Deadnight Warrior, I decided to splash my money on \"Something Wild\". Certainly I enjoyed it for the time being, but when I listen to it now after listening to tons of metal cd's, well....it kinda sucks, big time.\n\nThe cd has it's moments, for example in the first track deadnight Warrior, but when listening to the other songs, I get the feeling that CoB had a littlebit too much ideas when composing their songs at that stage of their opus. Most songs are composed in such a way, that every \"cool\" riff or breakdown could be used. Songs shift from one rythm to another, guitar riff followed by the next one, with very hectic keyboards draped over them like a blanket. This makes listening to the record one hell of a job, as CoB never really seems to catch the moment. Although I love the later work of CoB, this record is as cohesive as desert sand.\n\nNext to the afore mentioned negative points, Alexi Laiho was no where near the singer he is now. The vocals seem to be very hard pressed, and a littlebit too much for him at times. Next to this, I feel that screams such as for example a loud \"FUCK\" just before a guitar riff are soo not done, that it makes it all sound a littlebit childish.\n\nWe all know that CoB are one of the bigger bands at this moment, listening to their later records or seeing them live is a great joy, and you can hear that the potential was already there on this debut. But for a good introduction to CoB, I would advice Hate Crew Deathroll. Actually I would advice every other record but this one\n",
        "\nI remember the first time I heard Children of Bodom, so let me share it with you:\n\n\"(Browsing music videos on launch.com)...Hrmm, Children of Bodom...well that sounds stupid. \"Every Time I Die\"? Wow, did they just rip that name off that hardcore band or whatever? Eh, oh well. *Click*...(5 minutes later)...Wow, that sucked\"\n\nYes, I admit it. The first time I ever heard Children of Bodom, I thought they were pure garbage. I honestly can't remember why, but I know it was back when I was just starting to get into Metal, and they just didn't seem cool I guess. Over time, I forgot about them, until I came across and joined Sputnik Music. It was, believe it or not, ShadowsFallen review of this album I sit here listening to (\"Are You Dead Yet?\") that sparked my re-interest to check them out again. I had my doubts, seeing as how I was, and still am, in the solo-craze mode where I desperately need a solo in each song to satisfy my craving, and I didn't know if Alexi could produce. So I forced myself to buy \"Follow the Reaper\", which seemed to be hailed on here as their greatest. Needless to say, I was blown away. After bashing my head into a wall for 10 minutes to punish myself for believing they sucked, I went out the next day and bought \"Are You Dead Yet?\", simply because they didn't have \"Hatebreeder\".\n\nNow, as most of you all know, Children of Bodom are rather unique in the Metal community. Nobody else does, or possibly could sound like them. Infusing elements from Black, Death, Power, and even some Thrash at points, Children of Bodom combines the best out of all of those genres to create a truly breathtaking musical experience. But over time, much like most Metal bands, their sound begins to progress. In Bodom's case, it got heavier, less neo-classical, and more straight-up metal sounding. And while some cried \"Heresy!\" at this, others such as myself ate it up in one big mouthful and wanted more.\n\nThe album kicks off with what almost does feel like one of those classical moments off \"Hatebreeder\", due to the ominous sounding keyboard. However, very soon, the boys of Bodom show you what's going on here, with some huge chugging riffs that one could only stomp their feet and headbang to at the same time. The song moves on to a more imaginative guitar riff, before it kicks straight back to the heaviness again with some huge thick riffs. The chorus by far is the best part of the song, incorporating a sense of melody to contradict the blasting guitars that throw out a variation here or there. The title track is just as interesting, as it starts off with guitars the throw out fills that I can only describe as almost Egyptian sounding in-between thumping drums. The verse is just some split out-second riffs that grind straight into your head. The chorus is even more melodic than \"Living Dead Beat\" with more flowing guitars and a popping snare drum. \"If You Want Peace...Prepare For War\" is easily the most brutal, thrashing song on the whole album. The song features hard hitting, slightly more straightforward riffs that, right before the verse, kick out for a second to let the bass have its one moment of glory by plogging away the next climbing riff before the guitars and drums join in. It's depressing that after three great songs, \"Punch Me, I Bleed\" has to take it down a notch. The song is slow, and it seems bland and drags on. It attempts to be another \"Angels Don't Kill\", but doesn't even come close. But \"In Your Face\" wastes no time getting right back on track with some lock-step-crunch riffs (palm mutes (lock), pause, a few more palm mutes (step), and then a huge slam of \u2018em (crunch)). I wish I could've seen the looks on some of the die-hard Bodom fans when they heard this. It's simple, straight up, and heavy. No fancy guitar work and amazing lead and all that jazz, just plain old metal blasted into your face. \n\n\"Next In Line\" seems to almost have a slight bit more a of a Power Metal formula that was previously shown on their past records due to the creative, intriguing guitars that flow and drift all over the place. The intro/verse parts are based off some quick slides that go right into a quick crunch of notes. But if an award for songs that sound like older Bodom were to go out, they'd go to \"Bastards of Bodom\" and \"Trashed, Lost, and Strungout\". \"Bastards of Bodom\" kicks off with some split-second riffs with a bass chugging along in-between. The keyboard takes a more dominant role that hasn't really been seen yet, which is played over a more straight-forward type riffing. The song incorporates a huge sense of melody throughout, which gives it that classic feel. The same can be said for \"Trashed, Lost, and Strungout\" as it opens up with what I've felt sounded like a Thrash Metal riff before the fast-paced, balls-to-wall lead part is played over it. The guitars then take a back seat to the climbing keyboards, and then chaos is opened during the verses. The verses are extremely frantic, as the riffs are like machine guns, firing out left and right. The choruses are virtually the same chaotic feel. The final song is actually one of my favorites off the album, \"We're Not Gonna Fall\" is a fist-pumping, hard hitting song. The opening riff is one of thick palm mutes that even feature some cool use of pinch-harmonics at some points. The verses will seem unpredictable to some at first, just because it goes from a seemingly straight-forward riffing to a full on assault of chopped riffs. After the crunching chorus, the bridge features just the drums with the keyboard playing an atmospheric number before the guitars come crashing right back in; a great way to end the album.\n\nIf you've heard Alexi play before, then you know one thing: The guy can solo. While they might not be that long (usually a mere 15-20 seconds), what the guy does in those short seconds is amazing. Shredding notes, great effects use, the whole 9 yards. Solos off of \"Trashed, Lost, and Strungout\", \"In Your Face\", and \"Bastards of Bodom\" are just downright sheer brilliance from his fingertips. It's also awesome to hear the keyboard switch off solo parts with him, like when they turn \"If You Want Peace...Prepare For War\" to an all-out solo brawl between Alexi and Janne as they switch back and forth constantly, each seeing to outdo the other. And while Janne's presence in the riffs isn't as apparent as before, his solos, like Alexi, are groundbreaking. I don't think I ever will hear another guy that can play a keyboard to make it sound like a guitar is soloing. His solos on tracks like \"Living Dead Beat\" will make you think Janne is playing a flippin' guitar, that's how awesome they sound.\n\nAnd then there's Alexi's voice. Just like a lot of vocals out there, you either love \u2018em or hate \u2018em. His past efforts on \"Hatebreeder\" and \"Follow the Reaper\" gave him more of a \u2018Black Metal' style. However, as time progressed, which showed on \"Hate Crew Deathroll\", his scream/growl became less dominant, and you could actually make out what he was saying. And such is the case here. I feel this is his best vocal performance to date, with a screeching voice that you can actually understand what he is saying. And to combine his kind of voice with the song to create a sense of melody is no small feat. All of these songs contain huge amounts of melody, especially \"Are You Dead Yet?\" and \"Bastards of Bodom\". \n\nHis lyrics, too, have also improved. Let's take a look at some of past efforts real quick: \"The reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path, Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed. You mother***as just leave me be, Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside\" came off of the track \"Hate Me!\", and as you can see, they're a little bit cheesy. But that's not really the case here. Evolution is the key to the lyrics here. Take a look at the title track, with my favorite Bodom lines: \"Enemy, take a one good look at me. Eradicate what you'll always be, Your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror I behold. Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor, Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore. Should I regret or ask myself, Are You Dead Yet?\". They're a huge step up from his previous work. However, older moments shine through, and they're actually quite welcome. On \"In Your Face\", Alexi goes back to his \"Fuck You!\" type lyrics, with some cool (but laughable) saying of \"I don't give a flying f*ck, motherf*cker!\", which is repeated over and over. And his love for lyrics involving the Reaper haven't been lost either. On \"Bastards of Bodom\" Alexi screams out \"Just go to Hell, by the edge of my scythe!\".\n\nIf there were really only two things that could bring this album down besides the song \"Punch Me, I Bleed\", it would be the lack of a dominant bass and the drumming. Let me start off first with the bass. While it does have its moments like on \"If You Want Peace...Prepare For War\" where it's by itself, it's not enough. I wanted some great bass licks, like what was done off of \"Warheart\". So sadly, the bass could do a lot more here than just follow along. And while the drumming is good quality, it's not amazing or anything. While the fills that Jaska does on tracks like \"In Your Face\" and \"Living Dead Beat\" are all good stuff, I've come to learn that when the music gets heavier, and more simplistic, the drummer should kick it up a few notches. I'm in no way saying Jaska is a horrible drum; in fact, he's quite good. I just wished I could've gotten more out of him, just like Henkka on bass.\n\nThis is one hell of an album. Because of this, I was able to delve deeper into the wonderfully talented world of Children of Bodom. And while the one song \"Punch Me, I Bleed\" is quite bland, and the drum/bass package isn't that strong, Alexi's guitar work/vocals/lyrics, Janne's great keyboard work, and some great songs completely make up for it. Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you haven't already. Good stuff here, good stuff.\n\nOverall - 91%\n\nRecommended Tracks\nLiving Dead Beat\nAre You Dead Yet?\nIf You Want Peace..Prepare For War\nTrashed, Lost, and Strungout\nWe're Not Gonna Fall\n",
        "\nHmmm, so this is Children of Bodom's first single album. I gotta say it\u2019s fucking awesome! It contains two songs, Downfall and No Commands (Stone Cover). When looking at the album cover, it looks almost exactly like the Hatebreeder album cover. The whole cover is colored green (my favorite cover, but who gives a damn), it has a lake (Lake Bodom, I believe), ground with all these trees covering it, and of course, the logos! The only difference I see in the covers is that in the Hatebreeder cover, the reaper is standing on the ground with the scythe in his hand and his other hand pointing in some direction. However, this cover has the reaper almost covering the whole picture, but faded out almost til the point where he is invisible. But anyways, on to the music.\n\nThe first song is \"Downfall\", and you already know it\u2019s my favorite song off the album Hatebreeder. I must admit I didn't like this song when I first heard it. Then after three months, I got into it. Now, I can't stop listening to it! It's an awesome song! The real highlight of this song is the keyboards, but the other parts rule too! This song is probably the best keyboard performance by Janne yet! To me, the best part of the song with the keyboards is at approx. 2:25-2:53. They sound really epic, especially with everything else added in. Overall, this is one of the greatest Children of Bodom songs I\u2019ve ever heard. It's my second favorite over all there other songs (The Nail wins first).\n\nThe last song is called \"No Commands\", which is a Stone Cover. I don't know anything about Stone, except they made an awesome song for Children of Bodom to cover. The funny thing about this song is Alexi's vocals, it sounds like a cross from his vocals on Something Wild and Hatebreeder, probably because it was released in 1998 and that was the year between the releases of those two albums. This song is also available in the Japanese version of Hatebreeder as track number 10. This is also another great song. The best part of this song is those riffs at 2:30, they sound like Iced Earth: Night of the Stormrider riffs. The ending of this song is awesome too, making a great ending to a great single album!\n\nOverall, this is probably COB's best single album. I hear this album was the reason Children of Bodom could schedule a concert in Japan (Tokyo Warhearts).\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom are known for making heavy music with a melodic twist. With their EP \"Trashed Lost and Strungout,\" fans can get to see a different side of Bodom. This side of the band is more American influenced then their other releases, and less melodic. The band seems more concerned with writing catchy riffs, than to focus on their lyrics, or the overall quality of the songs. There seems to be a lack of passion in this four song release which includes and Alice Cooper cover of \"Bed of Nails\", and a cover of the Andrew W.K song \"She is Beautiful.\"\n\nWhat saves this cd from being horrible is the enhanced video footage of the band. The video footage includes the video for the single \"Trashed Lost and Strungout\" which is poorly written, and generally a boring video to watch. It is just the band performing, and there's nothing special about it that sets it apart from any other music video. \n\nThis EP also includes the \"Trashed and Lost in Helsinki\" video, which is a video of the band going to various sites in Helsinki and Espoo, including the infamous Lake Bodom. It's a very comical video which includes the band dressing up in Napoleon hats, Viking helmets, Firefighter hats, and spraying silly string in a car. It shows that though their music is serious, they're a very fun band, and they do hilarious things when they're drunk. This video was very fun to watch, and it made the EP worth buying, though the quality of the songs aren't the best, the dvd footage is very interesting to watch.\n\nOverall, this EP was average. What the cd lacks in, the dvd footage makes up for. I only suggest this for people who are interested in seeing Children of Bodom, behind their music. If you want to buy this cd solely for the music, I don't reccomend it.\n",
        "\nHate Crew Deathroll is not only thrashier sounding than previous albums \u2013 its also more chaotic, angrier, and excessive. The fine-tuned polished sound has been replaced with all of this and Children of Bodom are moving away from the power metal influence and replacing that with a thrash influence. For fans of some of the previous work \u2013 this album is going to sound harsh to you \u2013 for thrash fans like me this is a little slice of heaven.\n\nChildren of Bodom had already hit the mark with their powered death metal ways. To keep the sound from growing stale they must have decided that they needed to challenge themselves because Hate Crew Deathroll is non-stop excess in its writing.\n\nThe guitar work is crisp sounding with a lot of speedy melodies and blazing leads and solos. In fact, a good portion of this album is solos on guitars and keyboards. Both guitarists and the keyboardist are amazing musicians and this album (even though it seems egotistical at times) fits together very nicely. The guitar work is as tight as ever with the solo and rhythm trade-offs being non-stop. The catchiness of the leads is astounding and even the rhythm is going to have some of the most critical fans nodding their heads. \n\nThe inclusion of faster and less power metal sounding keyboard lines gives the album a jacked up feeling. Warman is an impressive keyboard player who must have felt the need to challenge himself in his soloing on this album. Although in the production of the album the keyboards are now pushed a little further to the back then normally. There is a strong focus on the dueling guitars.\n\nThe bass has been stepped up to the front once again. The bass had disappeared for a while in the band\u2019s career but now with Hate Crew Deathroll it has taken back it\u2019s rightful rhythmical throne. The bass holds a very strong place as the main rhythm guitar on this album and during most of the soloing it\u2019s the sole force that keeps the music from derailing and just heading off into improvised territory. Similar comments on the drums. The use of the snare and bass drum really give this album structure that it needs.\n\nAlexi\u2019s vocals are a big controversy on this album \u2013 and really I have no idea why. He doesn\u2019t wander all that much from his normal sound. Hate Crew Deathroll\u2019s vocals are definitely more thrash sounding than death sounding now. And with inclusions of some half-way sung sections and even some spoken parts (\u201cNeedled 24/7\u201d is a great example of this) there is some new variety here. The lyrics are finally getting better - \u201cAngels Don\u2019t Kill\u201d is somewhat thoughtful. But they still aren\u2019t anything amazing. \n\nWhat some people may call a step back for the band, this album gave me a similar feeling that the band\u2019s debut did. The music is slightly more chaotic (with so many solos \u2013 this isn\u2019t that hard) and the album in general just feels so much more threatening. There is a new angry energy that flows from the album that the band has been missing for a while. It\u2019s not all that similar to the debut there are some new elements present. For one there is a ballad-ish type song (\u201cAngels Don\u2019t Kill\u201d) that really breaks up the speed and intensity that the album really pushes and gives the listener a break. \nEven though it\u2019s not as high rated compared to the other Children of Bodom albums \u2013 this is my second favorite album of theirs. I don\u2019t think it has as solid of writing as their last few \u2013 but it\u2019s pure excess is enjoyable and the new found energy is really thrilling.\n\nSongs to check out: Needled 24/7, Sixpounder, Triple Corpse Hammerblow.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom never cease to amaze the hell out of me. Their debut is a massive success, their sophomore album is positively stunning, and Follow the Reaper is damn near perfect. I figured they weren\u2019t going to get much better as a band but Follow the Reaper is spectacular. It even has better production then the previous releases.\n\n*Note on rating: Children of Bodom\u2019s third album, Follow the Reaper, had some big shoes to fill as a follow up to their last release, Hatebreeder. Granted my ratings for Hatebreeder are slightly higher than this album, but Follow the Reaper met the challenge of its predecessor and for some people surpassed it. For me, there are a few more flaws on this album then I thought there to be on their sophomore release and these are my justifications for saying Hatebreeder is a better album.\n\nChildren of Bodom are pushing further and further towards a power metal sound with each release. This album is borderline power metal were it not for Alexi Laiho\u2019s vocal style and the aggressive nature of the music in general. The music isn\u2019t near as aggressive as it has been on previous releases \u2013 one aspect of this album that I was disappointed with. This album has a lot of energy still but much of the music isn\u2019t near as threatening.\n\nThe guitar work is non-stop trade off leads under toned with some chorded notes. Not the entire album is this way, there are some very killer thrash riffs present on the album but most of the guitar work is melodic oriented. For a powered death metal band, this isn\u2019t anything too new. The talent that both guitarists radiate from their fret work and writing is practically nuclear. They have some extremely catchy guitar lines in this album and newer fans to the band are really going to latch on to this. \n\nThe keyboards are a definite force to reckon with. They have been really brought out, and with the talent of Warman on that keyboard, it was bound to happen. The keys add a great friendly vibe to the album (one of the reasons this album is as popular as it is). Although I believe the keys are excellent, I still would have liked the focus to be guitar work being Alexi is also an amazing guitar player. Both solos from guitars and keys work well off of one another and sometimes its hard to tell the two apart. \n\nThe bass work isn\u2019t as near appreciated on this album. The bass is devoured by louder drums and guitar work. There aren\u2019t as many \u201cbass breaks\u201d on this album. The bass player is one of the best and most charismatic players in the scene today and I missed some of his work. \n\nAlexi\u2019s vocals, as was said before, are still very harsh and death metal but now there is a little better production on them. You can understand him a lot more this time \u2013 and even though the lyrics are still in need of some work \u2013 they really don\u2019t have a massive impact on the listener. Group vocals work very well on this album and make it seem as though some of the songs are just really well produced live recordings. \n\nFollow the Reaper is a great starting place for new Children of Bodom fans. It\u2019s very catchy, mostly listener friendly, and it is very well written. The band is moving slightly more away from death metal but its ok. The transition is going quite well. A great album for both older and newer fans. \n\nSongs to check out: Bodom After Midnight, Mask of Sanity, Hate Me!\n",
        "\nHatebreeder is one of the most intense and stunning albums I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. Everything that was even slightly faulty on the Children of Bodom\u2019s debut, Something Wild, has been righted. This album is a culmination of amazing musicianship and some of the most inspired writing that metal has seen. \n\nWith the new, immensely superior production value, Children of Bodom have finally found their niche. With their classical and power metal influences, this increased production helps the band immensely. It\u2019s not top of the line production but compared to the debut it\u2019s a massive improvement. Some bands thrive on poor production (Venom comes to mind) and then there are some bands that need a little better production to be able to show their true colors. Children of Bodom benefit a lot from having this better production. \n\nMusically, the band is focused and the music writing shows it. Rather than chaotic guitar work and stop and go writing, the music flows very well. Concerning the guitar work (the pride and joy of Children of Bodom) the dueling guitars are well spun with a lot of melody being brought to the front of the music. The solos and leads are catchy and feel as though they could make sparks fly with their amazing fret work. The rhythm for the guitars is more chord work than thrash riffs although the riff in the beginning of \u201cWrath Within\u201d is pretty impressive. These chords give the album an even more power metal feel then previously.\n\nMore of the rhythm section is taken by the bass and drums, including a killer bass intro to the entire album on the song \u201cWarheart.\u201d The bass and drums are a little more toned down then previously and there is less variety in both compared to the guitars and keys. The keyboarding down right obliterates most of the keyboarding in the metal scene. It borderlines guitar work on Hatebreeder. The solos on the keyboards are well done and even though I am a huge guitar freak \u2013 I felt the keyboards outdid the guitars in some of the songs.\n\nThe vocals from the singer aren\u2019t as varied as much as I was hoping. The understandability of the lyrics is pretty decent for death metal vocals and sometimes there are parts that are harshly spoken. The addition of some whispers and band chants give the album some great variety even if they seem a little out of place at times. The lyrics are the weakest part of this album (and would be the bane of Children of Bodom into the future too). They aren\u2019t the best and most thought out. Most of them don\u2019t really rhyme and the topic of hate is a staple for the well titled hate crew.\n\nHatebreeder is the best album by Children of Bodom I believe. Granted when compared with their debut (which was also quite impressive) this album is particularly superior. The writing has an amazing flow for a powered death metal album and even though the lyrics need a little work they don\u2019t detract from the amazing musical talent of all the members.\n\nSongs to check out: Warheart, Bed of Razors, Downfall.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom really have something on their hands with Something Wild. It is simply one of the best debuts that I have heard in quite a while. Even though there are some faults in the album \u2013 overall it is quite impressive and creative. Some bands try to do the melodic and heavy factor and few of them pull it off as catchy and clever as Children of Bodom have.\n\nSomething Wild has its problems granted. It\u2019s production values are pretty minimal and the mixing has some faults in it (at one point the guitars actually pop out louder in the middle of a note for about a half second \u2013 freaked me out originally). These are simple things that make the album a little rougher to listen to \u2013 and make the fans a little more dedicated to love. \n\nThe writing of the album is quite chaotic sounding. There are many stop and go sections and with breaks along with \u201csolo\u201d parts for almost every instrument. The guitars are fast, spastic, and catchy. There is plenty of melody (part of the charm of Children of Bodom) and with the keyboards there is plenty of moments where you can tell the band have some classical music influence. The solos are amazing (when you consider the age of the members and the age of the band \u2013 even more amazing) and the leads are well played. The guitar sound is often mudded down due to poor production but if one listens hard enough you can hear the talent. \n\nThe bass work is pretty damn good and even though I felt the bass was a little strong on this album \u2013 he keeps the variety up and really plays like a guitar player rather than an underlying element. The drums are varied and sound like death metal at times and other times sound like power metal. It\u2019s a great combination of sounds to give the album a very unique feel. The keys in the album are also a little on the \u201cunpolished\u201d side but are very useful at giving us great depth to the music.\n\nAlexi Laiho definitely embraces a death metal vocal technique (with a little variation) on Something Wild. He uses the deep part of his lungs to push out lyrics of hate, death, the reaper, and Lake Bodom. The use of movie sound clips gives the album an interesting side take \u2013 I recognized the opening one to be from the TV movie, It. They fit well on the album and even though they sound pretty of low quality, flow well with the rough edges of the production. \n\nChildren of Bodom are a force to reckon with. An original mix of styles along with some interesting concepts and so much talent that seasoned bands may get jealous; Children of Bodom are on the edge of greatness with this debut release. The production may get on some people\u2019s nerves but overall the writing is well done (chaotic but amazing).\n\nSongs to check out: Red Light in My Eyes Pt. 1, Lake Bodom, Touch like Angel of Death.\n",
        "\nInitially, I had very low expectations for Children of Bodom. My friend was really into them, but during his infatuation with every one of the band's records from Something Wild to their latest, Are You Dead Yet. I myself was more interested in the seclusion that bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Megadeth, and Avenged Sevenfold gave me, and didn't feel the need to listen to a band which screamed about hate and death. I gave Lake Bodom a listen, and while the vocals really killed it for me, the guitars and keyboards drew me back every now and then. Pretty big mistake on my part, I guess. It wasn't until much later that I gave the band a deserved, unbiased listen. Predictably, I loved it. That's how things usually turn out with me. Bodom's debut album, Something Wild, was the first Children of Bodom album I checked out, and remains a favourite to this very day, getting constant listens from yours truly. But what do I think about their other albums, you ask? Outstanding releases as well. The first one of these records to be released to the public was 1999's Hatebreeder. No sophomore jinx (if such things exist in music\u2026) is apparent on this release, as listeners are treated to a fine 38 minute performance from the young Finnish quintet.\n\nMuch like their other albums, Hatebreeder is highlighted by Bodom's two strongest points. Their take on extreme power metal is a very impressive mix of shredding; thrashy riffs; neo-classical passages; melodic yet fast melodies; infectious keyboarding; and of course, am eerie atmosphere. Ok so that's all fine and dandy, but does it work? A resounding \"HELL YES!\" would be the only appropriate response to question such as that. Though their formula may seem too good to be true for some, Children of Bodom still manages to relentlessly pound out track after track after track without slipping up. Each track flows flawlessly from one to another and any momentum that is picked up by the band transfers excellently into the next song. The opener, Warheart, is a perfect example of the band's solid musical direction. When necessary, the speedy riffs from Alexi and Alexander are supported by the melodic keyboarding of Janne Warman, and vice versa. But saying that, Janne's keyboards do not mark a dip in the heaviness of the music. The riffs and leads still scream with the strength and power of a German power metal band and the aggressiveness of a thrash metal band. Though it may not be accessible for the masses, the music found on Children of Bodom's second effort should (and is, I guess) definitely be popular among the metal fans of the world. \n\nThe band's other strong point lies in the technical skill of its members. This is most apparent in the likes of Alexi 'Wildchild' Laiho, the guitarist and vocalist of the band. Not once does he cease to impress through his exceedingly impressive leads. Laiho's tactics take skill, speed, and power to the highest extremes, yet unlike some, he manages to hold off when such a performance would be harmful to the flow of the album. This is a talent that is not limited to Alexi, but is also shared by the rest of the band. Throughout the album, Laiho's shredding is fun to listen to, as not once does he let up on his relentless assaults. Yet in my opinion, Alexi is not the most impressive member of the band. That honour belongs to keyboardist Janne Warman. Never is he left in the dust by any of his band mates, as his speed and virtuosity are more than enough to make him stand out. When he isn't providing a very adequate rhythm to the music, Warmen can be heard soloing with that same strength and power found in Alexi's shredding. The keyboards really stand out during the second and third tracks, Silent Night, Bodom Night and Bed of Razors, where they maintain a very consistent presence in the music. \n\nChildren of Bodom is quite the talented band. While to those not immersed in the extreme metal may find them slightly difficult to get into, once you started liking the band, there's no going back. Hatebreeder is one of Bodom's essential albums, and should you find yourself liking the band, it's definitely an album worth looking into. Almost any type of metal fan could find something that they like in Hatebreeder, whether they're fans of power metal, thrash, black, or even death metal. Hatebreeder is a very memorable listen and while not my favourite album from Bodom, it's a very fun collection of music to listen to. Pick this up if you have the chance\n\n(Originally writeen for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nCountries like Finland are amazing places. From what this ignorant Canadian is aware of, metal of all kinds is appreciated a lot more there than it is here. Reading that over 13, 000 copies of Iron Maiden's A Matter of Life and Death had been sold to those crazy Finns (and 500, 000 in a matter of three or four days) only reinforced that opinion. So it shouldn't be any surprise that the country of 5 million churns out some excellent metal bands. Whether you like power metal, death metal, or black metal, you're sure to find something you like. One of the bands that has risen to the top of the metal scene, not only in Finland, but the entire world is Children of Bodom. Fusing a neo-classical power metal sound with a harsh vocal style normally associated with extreme metal, the band is a favourite of many. Bodom released its first album, Something Wild, in 1998. They have since recorded 4 studio albums and one live album, with their latest, Are You Dead Yet?, being released over a year ago. \n\nSomething Wild is a very fitting album title. Though it clocks in at just over 32 minutes, listening to Something Wild is like taking a musical adventure. The album is very atmospheric, with excellent keyboards and riffs which make songs like Lake Bodom, Red Light in my Eyes Pt. 1, and Touch Like An Angel of Death all that much more enjoyable. Bodom's axemen are definitely talented players, as heard in several of their complex solos and riffs. No member of the band lets up on their musical assault, which remains very aggressive through the 32 minute running time. This is great, as it seems Children of Bodom is at their best writing heavy material that's full of hate, which whiles it seems silly at times, I'm not going to complain about.\n\nBodom looses a lot of listeners when it comes to the vocals. Vocalist/guitarist Alexi Laiho has his vocal approaches rooted firmly in that of extreme metal. Though this may open doors to new audiences for the band, fans of a more traditional approach to power metal may be put off by Alexi's screaming and growling. I will admit, at first I was not quite a fan of Laiho's efforts, but I gave them another chance and began to appreciate them a lot more. Alexi's vocals are done very well, and not once do they take away from the music. Alexi does not present a distraction and his screaming actually fits the band's chaotic, hateful sound very well. When you think Children of Bodom, you think not only of the epic keyboards and neo-classical soloing, but also Laiho's vocals \u2013 the two go hand in hand. In addition to being vital to the band's sound, Laiho's vocals are also preferable due to the fact that each of the song's lyrics (save for those of Touch Like An Angel of Death) were made up by Alexi on the spot, and as a result, are not very good. The harsh vocals cancel out the horrible lyrics for the most part, as they are very difficult to make out on your own. Perhaps on of the only moments where one can understand Laiho is in the chorus of Red Light In My Eyes Pt. 1, one of the catchiest parts of the album. Like them or hate them, Alexi's harsh vocals are important to both Something Wild and the band's sound itself, and are not likely to disappear. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, Children of Bodom have a very impressive neo-classical element in their sound. This is likely what draws me to this album so much. Bodom's guitarists really know their stuff and they put it to good use on Something Wild, as heard in the likes of Lake Bodom, Touch Like An Angel of Death, and The Nail. The pitch on the guitars is perfect for such a sound and very enjoyable to listen to. Simply put, the instrumental section is very well done. It would have been interesting to see how the band would have handled a full blown instrumental on this release. As the album is only 32 minutes long, it certainly would have been very welcome.\n\nOverall Something Wild is a very good album, one of my favourite debut albums of all time. On this release, Children of Bodom introduce metal fans to their extreme power metal sound which dominates the much of the band's discography. Though the vocals might not be your cup of tea, if you are a fan of melodic metal, there is very little to be disappointed about. Something Wild is well crafted power metal at its finest. Get this if you have not already.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nAh yes, Children of Bodom. The band that brought us Follow the Reaper, Hatebreeder, and Something Wild. The vaguely defined, in terms of sub-genre, metal outfit has garnered a quite impressive fan base over the years. I could count myself as one of those fans, seeing as they're one of my favourite bands, and Follow the Reaper and Something Wild are easily among my favourite albums of all time. Yet\u2026for some reason I can't get into the band's fourth album, Hate Crew Deathroll. Though the band changes their style up a bit from, the \"Bodom feel\" is still present. Which is especially strange as I enjoy each of the \"Hate Crew's\" other albums. So what's my stance on this release? I'd say that Hate Crew Deathroll is definitely Children of Bodom's weakest release, and for the most part, is a pretty forgettable record.\n\nRight from the start, it's quite evident that something is wrong. The heavy, melodic, yet ultimately unimpressive Needled 24/7 opens up the album and as followed by the equally monotone Sixpounder and Chokehold (Cocked 'n' Loaded). It's definitely Children of Bodom, but when compared to the excellent beginnings of the rest of their albums, the Hate Crew Deathroll Bodom sounds uninspiring and uninteresting. It isn't until the fourth track, humorously titled Bodom Beach Terror, which Bodom starts to pick up the pace. And even this track, though undeniably good, is not in the upper echelon of the band's songs. With songs like the slower, ballad-esque Angels Don't Kill or the frenzied, rapid fire assault of (the also humorously titled and quite reminiscent of older Bodom) Triple Corpse Hammerblow, Hate Crew Deathroll manages to maintain some level of interest, but the slightly strong middle section is not powerful enough to over come the weaker start. And it isn't that songs like Needled 24/7 or Sixpounder are terribly bad songs, as they are, in a way, fairly impressive pieces of music. They just do not sound like they're very inspired or well thought out. \n\nBut how about the music to be found on Hate Crew Deathroll? To be quite honest, the music found on the album is not that bad. It's fairly good actually. The record could be considered a bridge between the often revered Follow the Reaper and the often mocked Are You Dead Yet. The melodious, neo-classical passages that were found on the former are still found here, albeit a little toned down. But the heavier aspects of the band's sound, aspects which can be found on the Are You Dead Yet, also happen to pop up from time to time. These heavier elements are part of the new direction that Bodom has decided to take, as songs like Needled 24/7 and Chokehold (Cocked 'n' Loaded) reveal, and are for the most part well done. Bodom Beach Terror probably does the best job in fusing together the fast, melodic, up-beat style of old with the crushingly riff-laden style of new, and when considering that it's one of the few songs to feature adequate song writing and Children of Bodom at their top level, then a case can definitely made to claim it as one of the album's best. You're Better Off Dead is another track which accomplishes this fairly well, but the album is not really consistent enough for my liking. \n\nOne element I've really grown to dislike on Hate Crew Deathroll is guitarist/vocalist Alexi Laiho's vocal performance. I found that his harsh screams found on songs like Lake Bodom, Follow the Reaper, or Warheart were about as enjoyable as harsh vocals can be, and did an excellent job in the role that they were granted. But with the band's forth album Alexi decided that, like the band's musical direction, it was time for a change. And like the music, the vocals haven't exactly gone through a huge transformation, but it's still noticeable. Opting for a more shout-like vocal style than a harsh, black metal shriek, Laiho's efforts are quite annoying, especially on some of the earlier tracks like Needled 24/7 and Sixpounder. His harsh shouts really disrupt the flow of the songs (which weren't especially great in the first place), and really takes away from the listening experience. Now, that isn't to say he's always bad. The sombre highlight of the album, Angels Don't Kill is one of the songs where Bodom's frontman is tolerable and actually put forth an emotion that doesn't convey rage and aggression. His efforts on Angels Don't Kill fit the emotions of the song, and really enhance the song's feel in a positive, noticeable way.\n\nOverall, Children of Bodom's fourth release, Hate Crew Deathroll, is a good release. But it isn't a great release. It suffers from inconsistency and well, a general lack of interestingness. It experiences a slow start with songs like Needled 24/7 and Chokehold (Cocked 'n' Loaded), a start that although the band slightly recovers from, puts a damper on the listener for many of the remaining tracks. Songs such as the emotional Angels Don't Kill and the brutal Bodom Beach Terror are just two of the songs that show Hate Crew Deathroll's good side, and are enjoyable listens that any fan of this type of music could enjoy. Though it isn't a bad release, I don't think I would recommend it, especially to new listeners of the band, as this is easily the band's weakest release thus far.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nHow many times can you pick up an album and say that it defines an entire genre? Not too often, huh? Well that's to be expected. But these albums are definitely out there. Powerslave, Land of the Free, Rust in Peace, Painkiller, all of these albums hold the crown of their respected genres, or at least in my opinion, but are there any recent albums that could bask in the same utterly metallic glory as the aforementioned albums? You could make a case for Children of Bodom's Follow the Reaper. Released in 2001, it was the band's third full length album, and by far their best. And in comparison with the rest of Bodom's discography, particularly early efforts Something Wild (my personal favourite) and Hatebreeder, that isn't exactly a statement to be taken lightly. So what you will about the albums of DragonForce (though their take on the genre is slightly difference, yeah, just a little on the slight side), Kalmah, or Norther, but in my humblest of opinions, Children of Bodom's Follow the Reaper represents the height of the extreme power metal genre, and a definite classic.\n\nFollow the Reaper starts off quietly, with the a spoken section which reads as follows \"Death be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful. Thou art not so.\" Just as the quote ends, the band suddenly blasts right into the opening song, Follow the Reaper. Just as the album defines the extreme power metal genre, the opening riff of the title track defines the album. Follow the Reaper (both song and album) is a very aggressive piece of work, complete with ear shattering solos, energetic heart pounding riffs, and technical yet eerie keyboards. It has pretty much anything a fan of power metal could ask for. Well, almost everything, but we'll get to that later. The relentless riffing is quite reminiscent of a thrash metal band, yet with a power metal twist. Songs like Children of Decadence and Mask of Sanity, among others, definitely showcase this aspect, something all fans of power, thrash, and ever black metal bands should enjoy. When I listen to metal, the most important thing, first and foremost, is the music. Bodom definitely surpasses all expectations in this area, with superb efforts all around.\n\nWait a minute; I said that there is area where power metal fans might not be satisfied in, yet I rated this 95?! Well, when I said this I didn't mean that there was a major weakness. But what I really meant was that, in general, most power metal bands make use of a vocalist who, in most cases, sings in falsetto. Children of Bodom do not have this. Instead they turn to guitarist Alexi Laiho for vocals. Like his power metal counterparts Kalmah and Norther, Laiho opts instead for a harsh shriek rather than singing. But that's perfectly fine, especially for those who enjoy such talents in the black metal genre. Truthfully, at first it was difficult to get into Children of Bodom because of the band's vocals, but once you get over this hill its smooth sailing from there (if that makes sense to you). On Follow the Reaper, Alexi's efforts are very strong, as can be heard in songs such as Bodom After Midnight or Northern Comfort. The vocals do not really vary throughout the album, yet they still manage to sound fresh and solid. Not to mention that they fit the aggressive overtones of the music very well. They might take a little while to grow on some listeners, but the efforts of Alexi on Follow the Reaper are definitely enjoyable, and very well done.\n\nEven though Bodom's debut album, Something Wild, is my favourite of the three that I've heard, I'll still maintain that Follow the Reaper is their best. I really enjoy the take no prisoners style that Bodom effortlessly and effectively creates through their music, as it is very infectious and a hell of a lot of fun to listen to. There is something that almost any fan of metal can enjoy from power metal to thrash metal, to death metal, to black metal, to even classic, Iron Maiden-esque moments. This album will most definitely be looked upon as a classic in the coming years (or maybe already), and is easily one of the best albums in not only extreme power metal, but metal in general. Check this out right away.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nChange. Quite a tough pill for some to take. Others welcome it with open arms. It depends on the situation. In the music world you'll find that change is in the air quite a lot. Unless your band is named Hammerfall, you will probably at least make some effort to the change the sound, writing process, or some other music related aspect, subtle or noticeable. Children of Bodom has encountered this change a few times during their musical career. While early one, such differences were fairly subtle; less atmospheric, more atmospheric, a little faster, etc. But the band made its first major change in 2003 with its Hate Crew Deathroll. While not a drastic modification from Bodom's neoclassical power metal days, it foreshadowed a heavier, darker sound from the extreme power metal heroes. Well, lo and behold, when 2005's Are You Dead Yet rolled around, such a path was treaded. \n\nAre You Dead Yet was a difficult album for some. Gone (for the most part) are the uncontrolled neoclassical guitar and keyboard solos which had become a trademark in the band's style. Gone are the tortured black metal shrieks which once shouted lines such as \"Bodom after midnight / Bodom after midnight whoa-oh!\" or \"In the night I crave to feel your breath / and your touch like an angel of death.\" Instead, such novelties have been replaced by a greater emphasis on aggressive riffs, and more distorted screams and shouts. Of course, cries of sell-out were bound to, and were indeed, heard. But has Children of Bodom descended to the point where such claims are accurate? Not a chance. Right from the start the band comes out of the gates with the same ferocious force and intense speeds that made earlier albums so much fun to listen to. Unlike the album's predecessor, Hate Crew Deathroll, the fire seems to have been re-lit underneath Children of Bodom's collective asses, as the music feels inspired and fresh. Each musician, except the bassist really, excels at his roll, especially Janne Warman. While his outstanding leads can still be heard every once and awhile, Janne focuses more on creating mysterious atmospheric or rhythmic elements with his performances. Songs such as Living Dead Beat and Next in Line do a particularly good job showcasing his role on the album.\n\nIn terms of songs, Are You Dead yet features several excellent performances. Next in Line and Bastards of Bodom are two of the better tracks to be heard on the album. Both offerings do a very good job in alluding to Children of Bodom's older sound, and their heavier direction, featuring solid riffs, intense drumming, and decent song writing. On both of these tracks can be found what are likely Are You Dead Yet's strongest choruses. With that said, the heavier material that everyone seems to be so caught up in does not fall behind. Are You Dead Yet, Living Dead Beat, Trashed, Lost & Strung Out, and some parts of If You Want Peace\u2026Prepare for War offer listeners brutal (the good kind) accounts of Bodom's book of heavy metal. Each of these tracks are very riff based, significantly more than any of the Hate Crew's older albums, and should impress fans of the thrash metal genre (which also seams to be a prime influence on Bodom's guitarist/frontman Alexi Laiho). The only tracks I cannot say that I am a fan of are In Your Face, We're Not Going to Fall, and the lesser sections of If You Want Peace\u2026 Each of these tracks contains an unrelenting heaviness that rears its head again and again, but neither of them really take such a characteristic and mould it into an asset. In other words, they're pretty bland and uninteresting.\n\nAfter four largely adored albums, Children of Bodom finally released Are You Dead Yet, one which recieved mixed reviews. Many fans and critics alike were disappointed by the direction that the Finish band took, and it often gets labelled as the bands absolute worst. Even though I do not consider the apparently controversial album to be among the band's best (i.e. top two or three), I do feel that it is a very worthwhile album to listen to. Are You Dead Yet contains a variety of well written songs which excel at creating the several characteristics that make up the tried, tested, and true Children of Bodom formula. If you're a fan of thrashy, melodic, riff laden metal, don't hesitate in checking this album out. However, I would suggest that newer listeners of Children of Bodom check out one of their older albums like Something Wild or Hatebreeder first.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nI never expected Children of Bodom to make an album like this. I doubt anyone did. It's been surrounded by one hell of a dispute, with opinions ranging from complete garbage to the coming of a new genre. I'm not here to assert my own authority or provide a final say on anything; only my opinion.\n\nThis is, like the rest of Children of Bodom's discography, an incredible album. Their first three were the pinnacle of the extreme Finnish power metal sound, fused with neoclassical elements and the meanest shredding this side of Asgard. Hate Crew Deathroll was the birth of a brand new sound - extreme brutal power metal, with the lead guitar, melodies, and keyboards coming through stronger than ever, only backed by a violent assault of riffs. Are You Dead Yet? is an expansion of that sound, delving even deeper into the land of the riff, never abandoning Alexi Laiho's affinity for melodic lead guitar.\n\nIt's this volatile mix of melody and brutality that makes Are You Dead Yet? such a worthwhile album. Trashed, Lost & Strungout was an amazing preemptive view of this new sound, featuring lightning-fast drums and blindingly technical guitar and keyboard work as usual. However, the entire album certainly breaks out of a one-track formula, bring forth a new sound for each individual song. The first single, In Your Face, is more of an anthem than a musical masterpiece. It seems to summarize what CoB is all about, making heavy, in-your-face metal. That's exactly what this track is, laden with bare-bones riffs, headbanging grooves, and powerful keyboard backing.\n\nThe songs Are You Dead Yet? and Living Dead Beat follow the led of the EP song Knuckleduster, providing more heavy ass riffs with a defined keyboard atmosphere topped with some solos that will surely turn heads. Other tracks like We're Not Gonna Fall and Bastards of Bodom are throwbacks to their Hatebreeder-era power metal days, with the dominant lead guitar driving the song and catchy melodies throughout. Others still fall between all of the extremes listed above, with Next In Line and Punch Me I Bleed providing an artful balance.\n\nThe latest Children of Bodom album is, in the longrun, a very creative album. No band has ever played a thrash/power fusion quite like this before. While fans of their older work may be caught off guard, open-minded metal fans in general should find this an enjoyable, unique romp in the valleys of weak-slaying riffs and Yngwie-slaughtering solos. CoB really did it again with this one, as, while different, an entirely worthwhile album full of excellent metal.\n",
        "\nChug. Chug. ... Chug. Wild solo! Ah yes, it's Children of Bodom's latest indecisive effort, Are You Dead Yet. A mallcore abomination in the eyes of some, another great Children of Bodom album in the eyes of others. But now that the momentary blast of hype following its release has distilled, it's easier to take a step back and come to a concensus on exactly what this album is: Mediocre. \n\nChildren of Bodom are now simply a functional band who lack the motivation to release meaningful, compelling metal. The band is now tentatively picking their resources in an atypically calculated manner, and keeping their distance from anything that could be deemed as dangerous. Children of Bodom was always just breezy fun with some fleeting moments of neoclassical brilliance, but I never imagined them releasing anything this brainless. The music is basically a step further from where they stood with the inconsistent but decent Hatecrew Deathroll, which means more distorted, uninspired aggro-metal riffing, punchier and and more irrelevant keyboard arrangements, annoying Zakk Wylde pitch harmonics thrown around, and lack of skill at hiding their influences. There are borrowed Pantera and System of a Down riffs all over the place. (Yes, System of a fucking Down. Listen to the album's title track then compare some of the riffs with SOAD's \"Highway Song.\" How the mighty have fallen.) And when the album doesn't borrow from others, it borrows from past Children of Bodom efforts. \"Punch Me I Bleed\" is basically Hatecrew Deathroll's \"Angel's Don't Kill\", but filtered of any positive qualities that song possessed.\n\nAnother problem, Alexi's trademark gnashing rasp has transformed into a comprehensible, low growl. I wouldn't really mind this, aside from one thing - Alexi is an atrocious lyricist. I mean, really bad; So bad the band stopped printing lyrics in the booklet. I could be listening to the best damn music in the world, and 'TuDe-FiLLeD bellows of \"I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK MOTHER FUCKER\" x3 and \"OH MY GOD YOU'RE SO FIIIINE\" would evoke either a sigh or mild laughter, depending on my mood at the time. The album's warm, fuzzy production doesn't help things either.\n\nAre You Dead Yet? is similar to a Spanish guy who doesn't speak English, running a complex inquiry through Babelfish and posting it on an internet forum: \"There is a certainty album my eyes has been on, and I am wondering myself if I verify a resource in line or I buy it in line. It is a question of which he is cheaper, I it supposes. Jajajajajaja!\" His intentions are probably good, but it's just hard to understand exactly what the hell he's trying to say. Same with Children of Bodom. Sure, there's plenty of \"rebellious\" pseudo-thrash and industrial crap, but I detect no blatant mallcore, and it also seems like the logical (if ill-fated) continuation of Hatecrew Deathroll. And at the same time, it doesn't seem like the band that wrote all the off-the-wall, crazy guitar/keyboard duelling on previous albums. My conclusion is that Alexi and co are parking their sound outside the realm of interest of CoB loyalists, but just close enough outside the realm of assorted mallcore junk to convey the impression they haven't abandoned their old fans. Their decision to create a \"safe\" album has resulted in a blob of mayonnaisey-white mediocrity sure to alienate you with its inoffensiveness, whoever you may be. \n\nSo, why such a low score if I'm indifferent to this effort? It failed to either inspire or engage me with its derivative backtracking into the aggro-metal hell of mid-90's mainstream metal. I might as well have been listening to the violent rhythms of a washing machine, which wouldn't cost $13+. As someone who appreciates Children of Bodom's previous efforts, I don't feel betrayed, I feel bored. If you're looking for some refridgerated \"grooves\" to bang your head to in a drunk stupor, this may be just what you're looking for. Others would be advised to avoid this compilation of filler material called a new album.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a foggy, stench filled night. You sense a mild disturbance in the air and grow weary of your current surroundings. Rain starts pouring down and you hear this desperate female cry of horror and pain in a back alley. Your first instinct is to make a heroic dash and offer assistance despite knowing in your head the strong possibility of a morbid discovery. It\u2019s the curiosity that drives you. Turns out an old lady just lost her cat again. This leaves you practically unaffected despite the original hesitation and fear of discovery of something potentially scarring. This, fellow Bodomites, would be the perfect summation of my thoughts hearing the latest CoB, Are You Dead Yet? Due partially towards the immense negative hype this album has created towards CoB legacy but left with nothing more than a sigh.\n\nChildren of Bodom have always been an harsh power metal band with eccentric tendencies for blistering speed and insane stylistic contrasts with dynamic riffs, harshness and fairly distinct, talented keyboard flourishes. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, which led to a continuous decline in speed, power and eventually started heading in a mere heavier, less riff happy direction. :/ There have been times where Children of Bodom have managed to reduce their chaotic sound and create a truly impressive, epic aggressive rifffest but the Follow The Reaper days are loong gone. Are you Dead Yet takes the heavily modern influenced stance once again and could easily be labeled a pro(re)gression of their previous works. Heavier riffs, less technicality and less prominent keyboards with more core and less metal. With all this negativity being said, Children of Bodom still know how to smash heads with their axes. There are still enough excellent technical guitar solos and more than your fair share of venomous metallic riffs. Sadly, most of these occur in the first three songs and trade off with tolerable modern riffs.\n\n\nAt least we can be thankful Alexi Laiho and company, have chosen not to remain stagnant and form into formulaic bodom. This album is still pretty good but suffers from less stellar riffing, out of place musical sections and I don\u2019t want to start on the lyrics. Shit I would be using a ripped CD as a beer coaster if I bothered to decipher even a quarter of them. The positive is that I do remain optimistic that Alexi Laiho can incorporate some facets of Are You Dead Yet? into a much improved new album. I would pass on this unless you have their entire back catalogue or have a preference to the heavy aspect and not the metal part of Bodom.\n\nFavorites : If You Want Peace.. Prepare For War, Are You Dead Yet?, Bastards of Bodom\n",
        "\nThis was one of my most anticipated releases of 2005, seeing as Children of Bodom\u2019s previous albums had amazed me with their sheer quality. It took me a while to get hold of Are You Dead Yet? due to delays and such which only built my expectations further. When I finally heard the album, it left me satisfied, yet a little disappointed. \n\nUpon first listen it is very obvious that the band have streamlined their sound, with fewer melodies, more straightforward riffs and slower tempos than on previous efforts. The keyboards seem a lot less prevalent than before too, and the drumming seems a lot simpler than on previous albums. Alexi\u2019s vocals continue to become more decipherable as well. The production is clear and each instrument is clearly audible which works to the bands advantage, giving the album a fuller sound. \n\nThe songs themselves are instantly recognisable as Children of Bodom songs, yet they also have individual qualities that make them distinctive from their other songs. \u201cIf You Want Peace\u2026Prepare for War\u201d is a fast paced thrasher with a triple solo battle between Alexi, Roope and Janne. \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Fall\u201d is in the mould of \u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d with it\u2019s group chorus shouts and catchy main melody, and \u201cNext in Line\u201d features groove orientated riffs and another memorable melody, reminiscent of \u201cNorthern Comfort\u201d. \n\nInevitably, the solos on the album are brilliant. Alexi and Janne still produce lightning speed solos and duels, with Roope even joining in on the aforementioned triple solo battle in \u201cIf You Want Peace\u2026Prepare for War.\u201d Janne seems to have toned down slightly and Alexi shines more on this record. This is not a problem due to Laiho\u2019s phenomenal skills on guitar, but Janne is equally as good on the keyboards and it is a shame that we don\u2019t hear him as much here. \n\nDespite broadening their sound however, the album does have its flaws. Some of the lyrics are absolutely atrocious (I\u2019m sure you know how \u201cIn Your Face\u201d goes by now) and sometimes the lack of pace can make the album drag a bit (even if it is just under forty minutes). The previously mentioned lack of keyboards can also be a problem. There are some instances where they excel greatly to fine affect, such as the start of \u201cIn Your Face\u201d or the mid section of opener \u201cLiving Dead Beat.\u201d But other instances, such as the verses in the title track, seem a bit plain and ordinary, something the band has never been in the past \n\nThis is by no means a bad album, but it is not a great one either. The tracks here are good, but they can\u2019t stand up to the high quality the band set themselves with Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper. This album is worth your time, but don\u2019t expect to be blown away.\n",
        "\nThis is where the legacy of COB began and it is worth mentioning that this album has a very different sound than those that followed it. This is a much darker Bodom, one that had more ties with their black metal roots than on the last few records.\n\nThe songwriting on here is arguably their best. The fusion of classical passages with extreme music is done extremely well here. The riffs in the opener \"Deadnight Warrior\" are catchy and heavy at the same time. The guitar tone is nice and heavy but the leads are very smooth and tasteful. This is another element to the record's sound, the melodic lines are much more tasteful than those you'll find on their later material.\n\nTo me, this is Alexi's best vocal performance. His sound on this is a total growl which I find fits the extreme sound very well. The songwriting is top class here, with catchiness and chops to show off. This is very fun music to listen to, even though it has a dark allure to it. \n\nA lot of killer tracks here. Since there are only seven songs, they were really well crafted and they all have their unique charm. The classics on here however are \"Deadnight Warrior\", \"Lake Bodom\" and \"Touch Like Angel of Death\" the album closer. This track is an excellent finisher. It's fast, it's melodic and the solos are mind boggling. Musically, the performance is that much more impressive if you consider that most of the band hadn't even reached their twenties yet.\n\nAll in all, this record slays. The songwriting is excellent, the performance is pasionate yet tasteful, and it's all heavy enough for any metalhead to want to headbang to it.\n",
        "\nMost metal bands have set standard as far as playing live, Children of Bodom are one of these bands. Anyone familar with this band knows this band is very unique, you can always describe the sound of the music but hearing it first hand is a whole another thing. Insane guitar shredding, millions of keyboards, and screaming mad man behind the mic. This is what you'll hear if you decide to check these guys out, but for those already fans of the band, you already know this.\n\nThe most important rule with any live album, is always sound better live than on studio efforts. Bodom really nailed this rule and knowing all what goes on musically, it's kinda hard to believe, but they pull it off brillantly. The album starts off with keyboard intro which very well done, it really sets the mood here. Alexi comes on stage and greets the Tokyo fans, Alright Toyko! and then we get thrown into \"Silent Night, Bodom Night\" which is a classic from Hatebreeder. The guitars sound so much heavier here than before, also Warmen keyboards so much more blended with music. \n\nThe band sounds so much better live it's almost hard to gasp. \"Lake Bodom\" which is pretty much anthem for Bodom, sounds so much more alive, like stated before. The overall performance of this song makes you just wanna erase the orginal from memory and insert this version, and this version only. \"Bed of Razors\" which probably my favorite song from the band, sounds very well exucuted. This is very melodic song and the riffwork here really carries the song. Also the vocal lines are great, going right with beat of the music.\n\n\"War of Razors\" is really nice battle bewteen keyboards and guitar. Warmen does a excellent job and doesn't fail at being creative here. Very good song writing and really shows how interesting and imaginitive the band really is. \"Downfall\" is really nice as well, defiantely better than Hatebreeder version, I've always liked the keyboard melody here. This one of highlights of the album, but really this whole album is pretty much flawless. The drumming and bass playing should be noted, with all the music going on you would think some this would get lost in the background but this not true at all.\n\nEverybody is top-notch which what you always want to hear. Children of Bodom Have really raise the bar for other metal bands with complexed music, this isn't easy music to play but it can be done. Let it be said I believe this one finest live albums out there and should be in every metalhead's collection, especially if your a fan of the band. This is by far the best thing the band have ever done! This album is very highly recommended, and make sure to pick it up on Vinyl while they last! Not to be missed.\n",
        "\nThe album that started it all. Back when they were just kids from Finland, they had a lot of fresh ideas to bring to the table. In 1997, you would be hard pressed to find a blend of tasteful guitar virtuosity, black metal atmosphere, neoclassical influenced keyboard parts, and heavy metal attitude. This album has it all. \n\nDeadnight Warrior starts the album out with a drumfill right into orchestra hits. Before you're a minute into the song, you already hear everything that was mentioned in the previous paragraph. As the album goes on, there are blastbeats to be had, melodic passages, headspinning keyboard runs, and not one instance that would make you want to skip a track. This is an album to be played from beginning to end.\n\nThe best part about this album is that most of it is very memorable and CATCHY. Some tag them as power metal with harsh vocals, but they were not power metal yet on this album. They were on their way there, and they definitely nailed the catchiness of the genre early. \n\nThere are no songwriting formulas used here, either. The songs progress seamlessly from part to part, interlude to lead, etc., and it never resorts to a concrete verse/chorus formula. Perhaps the most impressive example of their progressive mastery is the song The Nail. The Nail is perhaps the best song this band has ever penned, and it baffles me as to how these guys enjoy their newer stuff more. \n\nAn impressive start to a great career for these five talented kids. Though their songwriting ability would eventually deminish in favor of the almighty dollar, they still have some of my respect due to their back catalog. If you don't own this album, you're missing out on Children of Bodom's finest hour, er, half hour. The only complaint would be that the album is too short. Even with only seven songs, it stands strong and will end up being this band's \"Beneath The Remains\", so to speak - their true classic album overshadowed by the more commercial sounding albums.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom's album Hatebreeder can most likely be considered the pinnacle of their discography. With that being said, Something Wild can be considered the precursor to Hatebreeder. Tokyo Warhearts takes the best songs from each of their first two albums from two live shows in Tokyo. Basically a live greatest hits album from their first two albums. Now, on to the album itself:\n\nChildren of Bodom's live set is amazing. I saw them recently, and even though their set included a lot of stuff from their new album, they even made that sound decent live. But anyway, from seeing them live, you can obviously recognize the technical profiency of all the members. Their live playing is very tight, and it is apparent on this album. Aside from random little live quirks, the songs sound exactly like the albums, carbon copy, note for note etc. The live show is guided by Alexi talking over Janne screwing around on his keyboard, and they flow song through song, with random instrumental sections thrown in for extra flavor. Take \"Intro\" for example, basically Janne playing some TV theme, then Alexi coming out and yelling \"ALL RIGHT TOKYO!\" and then BOOM! Silent Night, Bodom Night right out of nowhere. Amazing.\n\nThis album is real hard to find, but if you can find it, please do. If you like any CoB, you'll be mesmerized.\n",
        "\nEven though my early descent from shitty, overrated, media love-slop bands to the classics (and then some) has been fairly recent, I was never prematurely drawn into checking out overhyped garbage like this.\nYes, Alexi Laiho is a great guitarist and can shred his way out of a collapsed circus tent without breaking a sweat, but even with his neo-classical tech-wankery knowledge and medical precision, he still is one tiddly-wink short of a decent songwriter. \n\nThat's right, it's out there now. Children Of Bodom would have been renowned for a one time shtick-stravaganza if they split up after the semi-decent, somewhat creative Something Wild. Instead, here they are again years later with more catharsis induced shredding, ridiculous keyboard abuse, pathetically weak-ass yell/screechs paired with worthless lyrics and the usual snoozing song structure. So what's different this time around? Well, Laiho still looks like he should be in drag, if that clears things up for you. Otherwise, not all too much.\n\nThe riffing is slightly less 'German power-metal ballad' and more death metal, with god awful hints of industrial for some reason far beyond my logic. The only relief I found is that they didn't pull a 'Grand Declaration Of War'. The drums as well, have been sped up considerably, but nothing too impressive. This doesn't mean C.O.B. will be booted from Headbanger's Ball Vol 3, however. How did I know that they featured 'Needled 24/7' last time? Fuck you, that's how. Anyway, every sliver of influence featured here is once again drowned out by the incredibly silly Stratovarius-on-PCP-eque keyboard masturbation that's been painting the town red since the mid-90's. Why people eat this stuff up is beyond me...\n\nThe strangest thing on here is how they somehow did an unentertaining cover of Britney Spears's 'Oops I Did It Again'. I figured this would be the highlight of the album, but god damn, it lacks something, too. If Exhumed actually did something pretty decently as a joke, it's a cold day in hell when someone can't surpass them. They could have at least bested that Itchy and Scratchy theme song cover by whoeverthatcrappybandwas. Actually, that was bad ass. \n\nStrangely, I enjoy pure power metal greatly as long as it isn't unbearably corny, and I'm always willing to accept a worthy melodic death/black metal band, but Children Of Bodom have combined these elements into something I find unlistenable. At least their first full length's had their moments.\nAlexi Laiho shouldn't be wasting his time on this terrible media frenzy and find a real power metal band to play for.\n",
        "\nThe Finnish kings of speed metal, Children Of Bodom, released their very first EP titled \"Thrashed, Lost & Strungout\" in 2004, about a year before the release of the \"Are You Dead Yet?\" LP. This extended play, which consists of two originally composed Children Of Bodom tracks as well as two covers, is definitely worth every penny.\n\nThe title track of this EP, \"Thrashed, Lost & Strungout\", appears first on this disc. Alexi \"Wildchild\" Laiho and his group waste absolutely no time getting to the point in this song. From start to end, \"Thrashed, Lost & Strungout\" is fast, aggressive and heavy. Also, since the EP's title song appears on the \"Are You Dead Yet?\" LP, it gives us a chance to see what direction the band's chosen to go for their new album. I would definitely argue that Children Of Bodom are going in the right direction.\n\n\"Knuckleduster\" is the second track on this EP. Although this track is slowed down a bit compared to the first, it's just as heavy and aggressive. Laiho and the boys do a great job on this one. Despite the fact that \"Knuckleduster\" doesn't appear on the \"Are You Dead Yet?\", it sounds very similar to many songs on that album. Therefore, much like this extended play's title track, you can get, more or less, a listen to the style of Children Of Bodom's new LP.\n\nThe two tracks that follow \"Knuckleduster\" are covers. The first, \"Bed Of Nails\", one is a cover of the ever famous Alice Cooper. This track first appeared on Cooper's 1989 LP, \"Trash\". Although I'm not a big fan of Alice Cooper, I have a lot of respect for him and the work he did and continues to do. This song is a great example of why I respect Cooper. Not only is it a great track, but it's times like this where you can see how certain artists may have influenced others.\n\nThe fourth song on \"Thrashed, Lost & Strungout\" is a covers of Andrew W.K.'s \"She Is Beautiful\". I'm not really familiar with this artist. However, this song certainly made me curious about Andrew W.K. After hearing Children Of Bodom's cover of \"She Is Beautiful\", I did some research on Andrew W.K. and although he ended up not being exactly what I was expected, I still enjoy this song, both versions that I heard. All that to say that the Finnish group does a great job cover with this cover.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Thrashed, Lost & Strungout\" delivers everything a Children Of Bodom fan should expect, heavy, fast and aggressive music accompanied by a couple of great covers. Although I wouldn't recommend this EP to the average Children Of Bodom fan, it is a very impressive recording. I would recommend this extended play to the die hard COB fans only.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom is back, and in . . . Quite the unique way, when you compare it to their previous works. Something Wild was furious and raw, Hatebreeder was refined and blistering, Follow The Reaper was slower and more melodic, Hatecrew Deathroll was brutal and heavy, and now, we have Are You Dead Yet. In my opinion, Are You Dead Yet is not a normal adjective. It's saying \"Fuck you\" in musical form, with plenty of hooks. That's something this album contains, accessible hooks that anyone ranging from a fan of Death to a fan of Sonata Arctica could enjoy. This is what makes everything stick together, the catchy sense of every song is the adhesive this album uses to distinguish itself from all of the others. Every element is still there, neo-classical passages, brutal drumwork, and of course, Janne Warman's AMAZING keyboards. That's actually what I believe is the highlight of the album, Janne Warman somehow pulls off another spectacular performance on this record. \n\nAnother thing that I have noticed from this album is that instead of a band full of people who play their respective instruments together, there is truly a sense of companionship. Nobody is left out, it's no longer The Alexi Show, which was a great show, however. Henkka Blacksmith, a man usually gone unnoticed, save for a few audible licks in Warheart and Downfall, now is just as prominent as anyone else, his bass playing heard much more than before. Jaska Raatikainen once again provides a solid drumming base, his work with the skins becoming more interesting and technical than on previous albums. Also, the drums seem to have a higher level of clarity, and sound much better produced than on previous albums. \n\nOf course, as you'd expect, Alexi is back, this time with a teenage idol of his, Roope Latvala. Alexander was a great player, this cannot go denied. However, Roope's technical prowess equals if not surpasses The Wildchild. The riffs can be stinging and powerful, like the intro to Are You Dead Yet, or huge and crushing, such as Punch Me I Bleed. To be honest, I know why they are going for a more heavy sound, the entire band, possibly save Roope, are fans of hardcore. This was evident, however, all previous albums featuring breakdowns. It must go said, though, Alexi Laiho truly is a mastermind of guitar. His solos, even though they might not be purely neo-classical, still are highly technical, with bits and pieces of his classical influences still showing up, such as Living Dead Beat, and If You Want Peace, Prepare For War.\n\nOverall, to describe the quality of it all, it's good. I will admit, Hatebreeder, this is not. This is not 568BPM of pure blast beats with Alexi playing six string sweep arpeggios for his rhythms, growling about the reflected hatred in his eyes. I originally listened, and I disliked it, I thought it was their swansong. However, I changed, and listened more. I came to the realization that Bodom is NOT going to die any time soon. There are only two aspects of this album I am disappointed in. Alexi's vocals are not as harsh as before, and while I accept their maturing, I wouldn't mind some harsh motherfucking growls a la Downfall. The other thing I dislike is the song In Your Face. Idiotic composition, the only Bodom song I have ever disliked. \n\nAll in all, Bodom is back, Are You Dead Yet being the logical conclusion of their previous four. Gone are the days of Kissing The Shadows. Farewell to songs like Red Light In My Eyes, Pt 2. They've grown up, gotten extreme drug addictions, gotten married and divorced, broke their arms, had their cherished guitars stolen, and had best friends leave them forever due to girlfriends. \n\nAnd to be honest, I fucking love it.\n",
        "\nI disagree with everyone here who says COB have sold out. They sure have changed though. No longer is this insane, wild riffs all over the place, this is more aggressive, simpler, more In Your Face music. Some people can appreciate the change, and still tell the different from scum like Slipknot, others can\u2019t.\n\nNow onto the songs.\n\n01 \u2013 In Your Face\n\nThe second single from the upcoming album. Starts off with a heavy rhythm riff. Followed by Alexi shouting \u201cGo\u201d (could this be replacing his old \u201cYeow\u201d?) the drums then join in, and after a while a haunting keyboard riff is played. When the vocals come in, you notice a difference, they\u2019re not as harsh as previous stuff, yet they seem to create a certain mood to the music. The chorus to this song is great, and the solos here are typical of COB. \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck mother fucker\u201d does seem a bit repetitive and pointless though. Another complaint of this song is the drums at 1:00 get on my nerves for some odd reason. Anyway, moving on.\n\n02 \u2013 Oops\u2026 I Did It Again (Britney Spears Cover)\n\nStarts off with some speaking, the instruments come in, spitting and coughing, this is obviously a joke track. Alexi\u2019s vocals are out of tune slightly on this track, and I think this is deliberate. Some random woman (Jonna Kosenen) does guest vocals on this track in the chorus along with Alexi, I think the song would be better without her to be honest. In the middle of the song they speak in Finish about some beer. Anyway, a funny track, only downsides are the woman vocals, and the \u201cwoo\u201d at the end (just annoys me).\n\n03 \u2013 In Your Face (Censored Radio Edit)\n\nDon\u2019t let this fool you, this will not be played on the radio! The track simply bleeps out the fucks, with a beep. I must complain, the beeps are too quiet to be funny, so really it\u2019s a useless track. The track is actually shortened, so it\u2019s the version the video was made from. I have no clue why it\u2019s shortened.\n\nOverall, this single is like marmite. You either love the change, hate the change, or like I did, go \u201chmm\u201d and listen again a few times until it grows on you, and you realise it\u2019s just a change. It depends really, do you want to like the new Bodom stuff, or do you want to hate it.\n\nI myself like it alot, but I do prefer the older stuff, Follow The Reaper being my favourite.\n\n\n80/100 for the few things I said, and the extras (althought the Britney Spears cover is great) just don't live up to the extras of the Trashed Lost & Strungout single\n",
        "\nWhen the Trahed Lost & Strungout EP was released, I was skeptical to say the least. The title track has since become one of my favorite CoB songs but Knuckleduster frightened me. Was this really the way Bodom was going to go?\n\nI guess you could say I'm an old school fan of CoB. I first got into them just before the release of Hatecrew Deathroll. I had no idea what this band was. I picked up Something Wild and steadily grwe to like it, even though I wasn't sure what to think at first. Over time I looked into Follow the Reaper, Hatebreeder, and finally HCDR. It wasn't long before CoB became my favorite band - they still are to this very day. \n\nThey both did and didn't go in that direction with Knuckleduster. My history with the band is relevant because many old fans will say they hate it for the obvious reasons: lead guitar is toned way down, vocals have changed drastically, and suddenly they are trying to be heavier. My point is that any CoB fan, old or new, can love AYDY. The key is to keep an open mind. People need to accpet that the band has changed. It is unreasonable to expect them to re-release Hatebreeder several more times or go back to the old style. Quite frankly, I'd rather they progressed and did something completely new instead of recycling the same style to death.\n\nWith Are You Dead Yet?, they have done just that. This is a whole new style of Bodom; one that I now love very much. Before you judge, clear your mind. Think of this as something completely different instead of comapring it to old work. Once you stop telling yourself \"Follow the Reaper was better\", you'll realize what this is instead of what it isn't. This album has a newfound brutality never shown by Children of Bodom, not even on HCDR. Melody is not lost - only toned down slightly to make way for highly creative riffing and keyboard work. The soloing is more impressive than ever and the band seems to have found something completely original with this album. I can't think of anything that sounds quite like this.\n\nOverall, this album is incredible. Calling it similar to anything else is foolishness, because this is one of the most unique things I have ever heard. Every song is jam-packed full of brutal riffs, new, catchy melodies, and mind-blowing shredding. They keyboard playing doesn't exactly make it Industrial, but it definitely makes the music stand as something fresh. They seem to have taken a thrash and melodic death approach this time around - If You Want Peace... Prepare For War has Slayer-esque back and forth shredding that blows most past solos right out of the water. Songs like Aer You Dead Yet?, Bastards of Bodom, and Next in Line have amazing melodic moments that prove the CoB we used to know will never completely die. To top it off, they include a CoB first: good lyrics. Lines such as the \"tainted flesh, polluted soul\" and \"should I regret or ask myself: ARE YOU DEAD YET!?\" sound incredible. \n\nIn the end, I could see myself coming back to this as frequently as I do their early work. I can't specify any recommended songs because each one is artfully crafted and honed to heavy metal perfection. So, to answer the question at hand, NO! CHILDREN OF BODOM IS NOT FUCKING DEAD YET!!!!!\n\n96/100\n",
        "\nAfter putting out classic albums like Hatebreeder and Follow the Reaper, in 2003 Hate Crew Deathroll was released. This album took the band in a new direction with more thrash and less power metal sounding melodies. The 2004 EP Trashed Lost & Strungout held on to this new style, and this even a step further. Being one of the most straight forward songs by the band so far In Your Face starts off with a heavy riff, and a great keyboard melody. Then comes up-tempo thrash with great and agressive-as-fuck riffs. The chorus aswell as the solos are absolutely awesome. Great song!\n\nThe next one is a very suprising cover of Britney Spears \"Ooops I did it again\"\nI didnt know what to exept at all, but this is great. the band seems to have'd really fun while recording it. The solo they added to the song is great, and the double-bass work during the last chorus rocks. Children Of Bodom is one of those bands that dont care what small-minded kiddies think is un-tr00 or not metal. This cover is metal as fuck, believe it or not.\n\nThe cencored version of the single song is a joke by the band, and a thankful proof of self distance, while the song contains a lot of \"fucks\" they are now cencored with big bleeps (yes, you can censor a song as a joke). This version is never meant to be played on the radio, its just here for laughs\n\nI have allready heard all of the upcoming album \"Are You Dead Yet\" and I can tell you that this song is kind of one-of-a-kind on the album, it contains songs reminding me of the 4 first albums aswell, so even if you dont like this, be sure to check it out on September 19th\n",
        "\nWhen listening to this single I realized that Children Of Bodom has obviously undergone a change. The first track, In Your Face, starts with a monotonous, yet catchy rhythm backed by piano. Now this may be a huge change from their early stuff, but this is still balanced out by the normal melodic guitars and tricky dueling solos later on. The solo may be short, but it\u2019s still there. The vocals on the whole single are pretty much the same as on Trashed, Lost, and Strungout and Hate Crew Deathroll. In my opinion this is neither a good thing nor a bad thing.\n\nOops I Did It Again ended up being better than I expected. I thought it was amazing how they turned a hiphop song into metal. They even added a solo in there. But it was strange how they stopped in the middle and started talking. Many people took this cover seriously but it\u2019s really obvious it is a joke after you listen to it.\n\nTrack three is basically a wasted track. I don\u2019t know why they would bother editing In Your Face. If it\u2019s playing on Finnish radio, who cares if they cuss in English, and you know they certainly aren\u2019t going to play this cacophonous music in the US (that was sarcastic if you couldn\u2019t tell).\n\nAll and all, I gave it a 93 basically because of the last track. Otherwise every CoB fan should buy this.\n",
        "\nAlright, so we get a new single from Bodom. With two songs on it, being a small teaser for the new album. Well, we have \"In Your Face\" and this song proves that Bodom have fallen under the MTV syndrome. To sum this up for the most part, this sounds like Disturbed with keyboards. Alexi's voice I actually think is better, it's not as harsh as it used to be at all. I don't like growling or anything so it's nice for me, but it's pushing them more into the mainstream and people are not going to be happy with that. The guitar tone is weak as usual, no big suprize there. Alexi is actually a pretty good guitarist, but the solos on this song are just bland and crappy. After the Disturbed wanna-be riffs, we get some modern gheyxcore bullshit. Oh, and instead of stupid Lake Bodom lyrics, we get angst lyrics and Alexi saying \"Fuck\" every other word. Where the fuck is the speed/power metal? I feel like I downloaded an As I Lay Crying single. Say good bye to the days of Deadnight Warrior and such.\n\nNext we get the Britney Spears cover. Now I'm assuming this is a joke, but even if it is.....it's one of the crappiest and un-metal things I've ever heard. It's funny for the first couple of seconds, but then you'll realize how sad and pathetic it really is.\n\nOverall, this is pure shit. MTV really got to these guys BIG TIME. Fuck this band and go get some real metal. I can only recommend this to mallcore and modern homoxcore bitches. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY LIKE METAL\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom proved my fears correct after \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" was released with this. This does not at all sound like classic Children of Bodom, and while the first track may not sound terrible yet, this EP makes a steady decline after each song. I can only hope the new album doesn't end up like this even though it probably will as it contains one of the songs from here.\n\n\"Thrashed, Lost, & Strungout\" starts off sounding at least somewhat like \"Hate Crew Deathroll\" with some melodic guitars and they are present through part of the song so its still not as bad as some garbage that follows this song, but other elements like Alexi's vocals have simply gone to hell and passed it by several thousand miles. At first they sound much more controlled, which doesn't make them much better, and later they go so damn high-pitched I can't even understand them. The song while not a total waste just sounds horrible. \n\nThe beginning of \"Knuckleduster\" sounds like something that would come from Disturbed, a hard-rock band instead of something from Children of Bodom. Then it gets more melodic definately. Alexi's vocals still suck badly. They are so damn horrible I can't even compare them to any other vocalists. \n\nThe beginning of \"Bed of Nails\" sounds like something coming out of a shitty horror movie with crappy organs and some other instruments. As it proceeds it continues sounding like a horrible horror movie and just gets heavier. This whole song is just so shitty and silly it doesn't warrant more than one listen. Alexi's vocals continue a decline as I think I hear him trying to shout instead of just his annoying damn growling.\n\n\"She is Beautiful\" just does it for me. That is the worst song to come out of a metal band EVER! I would rather listen to Opeth's shitty acoustic pieces instead of this. This is a 100% pure punk rock song like if I were listening to Bowling for Soup or some shit like that. Alexi's vocals are growling here but they sound worse than ever. The growls have no power left in them, and it sounds like he's singing in one tone the whole time, which is even more boring then him going all over the place with his vocals. I never thought Children of Bodom were capable of sinking so low, but they proved this with \"She is Beautiful\". The guitars and drum beats also sound like punk rock. There are no classic typical riffs and melodies like Children of Bodom have done in the past. This all just sucks. No great riifs, no great melodies, just typical shitty punk rock. This band is becoming a shame to great metal bands. And the bigger shame is that they once were a great metal band.\n",
        "\nI usually listen to a certain album or song depending on my mood. If I am enraged, pissed off, or somehow angered, I'd be very likely to listen to Suffocation, perhaps Kreator, maybe Death. However, if I am in a joyous mood, and feeling light-hearted, obviously by contrast, I'd end up listening to Symphony X, Ayreon, or Edguy. So as you see, what I listen to is usually dictated from my mood. However, as you might have figured out, there is one band whom I can count on to satisfy my urges no matter my emotions at the time, and as you've definetely figured out by now, that band is Children of Bodom. \n\nTheir aggression can be furious, with Jaska Raatikainen's intense double bass work, and Alexi's harsh vocals and powerful riffing, which is prominent on this album. When the vocal intro to, \"Follow The Reaper\" was over, and the riff came in, I nearly pissed my pants. Another excellent example of Alexi's ability to write very aggressive music can be found on the often times overlooked, \"Taste Of My Scythe.\" However, at the same time, their melodies can be light-hearted, with sugar-sweet leads layered over on upbeat drum beat. Alexi's creativity and keen ability to find the right notes are very obvious, shining through on such tracks like, \"Kissing The Shadows\", \"Follow The Reaper\", and \"Hate Me!\" His simple, to the point lyrics add to this, showing that he attempts to convey his emotion via his music, rather a direct lyrical message, as some other bands would.\n\nThe technical skill displayed on this album is amazing, as well. Alexi is an excellent shredder, who can play play sweep arpeggios at a very efficient rate, while maintaining a very good melody, and not overpowering the other instruments. The greatest example of this is my personal favorite Bodom song, \"Kissing The Shadows.\" As you all mostly know, at the end of KTS, there is an enormous shred duel, which after my first listen, left my mouth agape. That isn't all, however, Jaska Raatikainen is an excellent drummer, who sometimes can be very brutal and fast, and at other times, stay back and keep the beat while a melody is going by.\n\nOverall, Follow The Reaper is an excellent album. The musicianship is of very high quality, the songwriting is flowing, deviating from the normal flow of a verse, then a chorus, verse, chorus. While this is arguable with some people, I feel as if there is no filler, as every song is unique in some way. For these reasons, I give Follow The Reaper an A-. An excellent effort by Children of Bodom, and I can only see success in their future.\n",
        "\nI usually do not like live albums because they sound like shit usually and don't do the band justice, and even though this album does sound slightly touched up, it is one of the greatest live albums I have ever heard because of the ferocity and sheer energy put forth by every band member. The cover art was also very original I thought. Let's break it down track by track.\n\n1. Intro - This is what really set this live album apart for me, seriously. This goes against most metal bands try to exemplify, a keyboard solo that sounds very much like Enigma. It is actually Crockett's Theme from Jan Hammer (who did the Miami Vice theme song) and it sets the tone for what's to come. Hearing the crowd cheer along with it just gets the listener into absolute metal mode. It's dark and brooding, and all Hell unleashes when you hear Alexi yell, \"All Right Tokyo!\" 10/10\n\n2. Silent Night, Bodom Night - This track is better than the studio version, by far. Alexi's voice is simply superb, and the drumming is much more discernible, and pumps you up to no end. The dual shredding is fantastic as well, and makes you wonder why they would even bother in the studio....it's that good. Janne Warman proves to the non-believers that keyboards DO belong in metal. Once again, hearing the crowd in Tokyo chant along with the band is simply mesmerizing. 10/10\n\n3. Lake Bodom - One of my favorite songs by them because it's about the event in which they took their name from, so I was excited to hear it. The defining element that sets this live album apart other than the musicianship is Alexi's intros to the songs. Hearing him yell \"Good Evening Tokyo, we are Children Of Bodom and we come from fucking Finland!!\" blew my mind to bits, then the guitar riffs opening the song blew those bits to even tinier bits. Everything is in unison, absolute perfection. The drums are bombastic and powerful while the bass compliments it perfectly in sync. 10/10\n\n4. Warheart - This song sounds extra heavy for some reason, the bass is so low it creates a disparate sound that contrasts with the really high notes of the dual-guitars and Janne's sonic keyboards, but as crazy as that sounds....it works. Alexi's voice never falters either, he sounds almost superhuman. What exactly a Warheart is I'm not sure, but after listening to this song and almost breaking my neck from headbanging so much, I'm pretty sure I have one. 9/10\n\n5. Bed Of Razors - Another kickass keyboard intro from Janne Warman. This guy is such a virtuoso, i cannot believe he was only 19 when they recorded this. The opening riff is killer, and sets the air for the rest of the song. Alexi will break out into a solo here and there, but it's always compliments the rest of music, never in a \"Oh look at me\" fashion. When Kuopalla joins him note-for-note, nothing can top their sound......nothing. Everything is top notch in this song as well, even if it was one I never really liked. 8/10\n\n6. War Of Razors - This is cool because it isn't really a song, but a keyboard-guitar battle between the two virtuosos of the band, Warman and Laiho. There is this droning sound in the background during the battle that makes it seem like they are building up, settting the stage for bigger and heavier things to come. 8/10\n\n7. Deadnight Warrior - I know for a fact that any hardened Bodom fan was excited to hear Alexi ask, \"How many of you have heard about our first album Something Wild?\" Because they all know it comes down to one song.......Deadnight Warrior. This is the first song anyone ever really heard when they first heard Bodom, and I guarantee it holds a special place in their heart as well as mine. Hearing it live is utterly captivating, they never miss a fucking note and every instrument is clearly heard from the rest. The dual-axe work in this song stands out because it fades in and out with solos and truly outshines than in any other song. 10/10\n\n8. - Hatebreeder - This song is also good, but doesn't hold water against the the majority of songs on here. None the less, every member is at the top of their game, and the crowd is obviously into it every second of the way, which makes me actually feel like I was with them, like I am there. This is why I finally realized what live albums are supposed to achieve, because I felt like i was at this concert, and I relive the experience every time I play it. 8/10\n\n9. Touch Like Angel Of Death - Another classic from their first album done perfectly. \"Do you still wanna hear some more fucking heavy metal?? You got it.\" I expected to be blasted away after that Alexi asked that, but they go into a very slow but familiar riff, and for the life of me I cannot figure out where I know it from, but it fucking rules. Then the house then gets torn the fuck down, because they go into the best riff of the whole album, the drumming is superb, the keys on point, and Alexi's vocals bringing it all together. The chanting by the crowd on this track is the best in a live album, EVER. It makes me see the Japanese's passion for metal in a whole new light. And just when you think it doesn't get any better, the breakdown at 2:27 obliterates anything and everything in it's path. This is the best song they have ever done, studio or live. 10/10\n\n10. Downfall - This track is done well, never faltering at any moment, but never really standing out from the studio version or the rest of the tracks. Still a good one, and very worthy to be on this live album. 7/10\n\n11. Towards Dead End - The longest track on the entire album but a very wise choice to close it all down with. I hate to say it, but they lose a little of their energy towards the end, but that in itself makes the song title very fitting I think. A great way to cap my favorite live album ever, if they didn't sound fatigued, I would have assume they are cyborgs or something. A true experience every time I hear it. 8/10\n",
        "\nFinland's Children Of Bodom is an entity that really doesn't require an introduction. Since 1994 the band has hammered out some of the most awe-inspiring and significant music that is, in most cases, on a level all its own. Over time, Alexi Laiho and company have emerged as one of the most widely recognized acts in the underground. Dominating the scene with countless tours throughout Europe, South America, and Japan, the band finally assaulted the North American market with high profile gigs with the likes of Iced Earth, Dimmu Borgir, and Lamb Of God, only further expanding their frenzied fanbase as each show increased in attendance. As a fan who has been following the band since the beginning, I have witnessed both their misfortunes and their milestones and even though I feel they have never really surpassed the quality of their debut Something Wild, Children Of Bodom have blown me away on some measure with each successive release and, often times, left me pondering 'Who the fuck is Yngwie Malmsteen?'.\n\nSpeaking of new releases, even though it's been out overseas for some time, Children Of Bodom's latest EP teaser, titled Trashed, Lost & Strungout, will hit the stateside streets in early 2005. Rather than shamelessly attempting to cash in on songs they've previously recorded on earlier albums, the band opted to build this mini-disc around two new cuts and a couple covers. To give you a decent idea of what to expect, the pair of fresh tracks sound as if they could have been leftovers from the Follow The Reaper sessions. The opening song, which also happens to be the title track, starts out with what I assume is a Slayer inspired riff that morphs into a thrashing squelch harmonic affair, customary in Laiho's fret work. Naturally, it just wouldn't be Children Of Bodom if it didn't feature grandiose neoclassical guitar and keyboard interplay during the solo segments, and this song certainly delivers an abundance of lavish leads.\n\nNext up is a little ditty called \"Knuckleduster\" (not a White Zombie cover) and for some reason Chaos A.D. era Sepultura comes to mind. Not that it necessarily sounds anything like the Brazilian thrash legends, but there is definitely a similar vibe going on here that I really don't know how to explain. Considering Children Of Bodom are big fans, it would make sense that there could be some subtle influence in there. In accordance with \"Trashed, Lost & Strungout\", \"Knuckleduster\" also bubbles over with flawless guitar and keyboard noodling. Simply stunning, as usual!\n\nKicking off the cover's half of the disc is \"Bed Of Nails\", originally performed by Alice Cooper. It's probably been upwards of twelve years since I've heard this song, so I have no genuine recollection of it to compare to Children Of Bodom's version. I do remember, however, that Cooper's band did NOT end this classic with twenty seconds of blast beats. This aspect kills the overall flow of what is otherwise a great rendition. Thankfully this mishap is at the end of the song. Onward with the odd man out on Trashed, Lost & Strungout... Remember when Dragonland redid \"The Neverending Story\"? Now that was a strange choice that turned out to work great as a metal song. With the Andrew W.K. radio hit \"She Is Beautiful\" closing this EP, I am honestly speechless. The song was never very good to begin with and I am indecisive on whether or not it is any better now that it has been mutated into metal. I'll let you know when I know! By that time I am sure you will have heard it and drawn your own conclusion.\n\nMassive riffs is the name of the game and Alexi never disappoints in this department. The quality of his vocals have been on a decline for quite some time but other than that, Trashed, Lost & Strungout is a decent EP that will keep you fanatics drooling until the next full-length Children Of Bodom album is in your greedy little hands.\n",
        "\nNew Bodom material, rejoice! And unsurprisingly, there's nothing at all that reeks of disappointment. We've got two new songs and a couple of cover songs rounding off this E.P. Also add an enchanced section with title track video and goofing around in Helsinki video, and this is definitely worth having. The new stuff seems to have a mix of new and old in there. There's certainly some left over ideas from Hate Crew Deathroll, some melodies and keyboards that scream out Follow The Reaper and an all overpowering thrashiness fusing it all together. Shunning the more extravagant indulgencies of solos and such, they are still there, but more contained in their place rather than going all over the place as has been the case in the past where Bodom have simply awed with insane guitar/keyboard tradeoffs and the like. It begins with those prominent Bodom melodies and keyboards and guitar working neatly together, sliding into almost groove tinged crushers of riffs and then into a steady workout of typical Bodom ability. Both songs are similar and show definite promise for a new full length album which I am already eagerly waiting for! \n\nThen they charge into a Bodomed-up Alice Cooper cover \"Bed of Nails\" with Janne Warman showing what he can do to spice up little bits here and there. Now a very bizarre choice, an Andrew WK cover, which seems unfitting for such a technically minded group. Nonetheless, it's a catchy party rock anthem, which they take the time to shift up in technicality very slightly and season bits here and there like they did with the previous song. Can't fault them for having a bit of fun.\n\nThe video for the title song is basically just them playing in a warehouse, then adding some dynamic changes in camera angles and that's it. It has shades of the \"One (Jammin' Version)\" but you do get to see what's going on with the instruments and so forth. I've always liked to see what a band is like \"behind the scenes\" and how they are as people, so the 20 minute romp of \"Trashed and Lost in Helsinki\" is many things and certainly enjoyable on the whole. It displays a band with a good sense of humour and full of energy which is reflected on album. This is going to quench the Bodom thirst for those who just can't get enough, so purchase!\n",
        "\nIt seems like Children Of Bodom have broken free of the pressures put on them by the massive expectations of avid Metal fans and decided to write their music the way they want and have some fun at the same time. Nothing points to this more than tongue in cheek song-titles such \u2018Lil\u2019 Blood Red Riding Hood\u2019 and \u2018Bodom Beach Terror\u2019 which are cheesier than anything they have done before. \n\nOf course the band cannot get away without the cries of \u2018selling out\u2019 from their fan base, especially when the vocals are noticeably less harsh and there is even a croaky attempt at singing. Other than this the only other noticeable flaw is the over-polished production, which detracts a bit away from the more aggressive guitar riffs. These would have been suited to a guitar tone similar to Kreator\u2019s \u2018Coma Of Souls\u2019 or Carcass\u2019s \u2018Heartwork\u2019 which employ a clean, but raw feel that gives the riffs more punch. Despite this, \u201cHate Crew Deathroll\u201d is their best attempt at writing honest songs \n\nSo, what about the music? Well, the band still performs in the manner they always have, with each member putting in a typical virtuosic performance. The songs have moved away from the progressive natures of the past and are focused on a more straightforward and stripped down style than we are accustomed to from the band. They even throw in some techno influenced moments in the first track \u2018Needled 24/7\u2019. Although this adds variety, it doesn\u2019t sound all that convincing and such, ahem, mallcore moments are what stop this album from being better. \n\nThe riffs of the band have never been consistent enough to make an all out riff-fest album, despite the band pulling out the occasional memorable riff. On this album, this precedent continues. Here we have a mixture of riffs drawing from a Speed Metal background, and conversely some of a Thrash Metal nature, the most overt of these being on \u2018Sixpounder\u2019. A more melodic Gothenberg style that wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on an early In Flames or Soilwork album is also present. The faster riffs are often accentuated by a flashy scalar fill, which adds interest to the song structures. There is also some spectacular shredding action littered throughout the album, but this is usually limited which is a disappointment. Although this helps the songs keep direction, as they aren\u2019t flawed by pretentious wankery. The best examples of such lead guitar work occur on \u2018Bodom Beach Terror\u2019, \u2018Angels Don\u2019t Kill\u2019 and the title-track. \n\nThe keyboards work in tandem with the guitar and provide a backdrop that generates a healthy atmospheric presence. This also helps provide an extra dimension to the sound similar to European flavoured Power Metal bands. The keyboards also take the spotlight in some instances and provide some stunning solos, amongst the best the band have ever produced, comparable to such excellent playing as found on Stratovarious and Sonata Arctica albums. The keyboards are most eminent on the cheesy Power Metal track \u2018Triple Corpse Hammerblow\u2019 which also features a mid-section dominated by some nice Speed Metal riffs. \n\nThe band has also thrown in a slower tempo song, not far off being a ballad. \u2018Angels Don\u2019t Kill\u2019 is probably the best composed song on this album, layered with emotional and almost haunting keyboards providing the atmosphere with some fantastic lead guitar melodies at the forefront. \n\nAlso, worth a mention is the inclusion of two well executed covers from The Ramones and Slayer. Fans of the band may be pleasantly surprised if they give this a fair hearing. \n\nWhile this may not be as good as Children Of Bodom\u2019s \u2018Hatebreeder\u2019 masterpiece, it is in every right one of the band\u2019s more consistent releases. Sure, it is toned down compared to their previous outings, but the song writing is free of the distracting aspects that their more technical progressive moments provided in the past, and is amongst the most consistent they have produced.\n",
        "\nThe newest release from Finland\u2019s melodic death metal heroes, Children of Bodom, has been out for awhile but always seems to hold a prominent spot in my CD player. The album is called Hatecrew Deathroll, and while it isn\u2019t exactly groundbreaking it is still the same thrashy melodic sound that we have come to expect from the Finnish quintet.\n\nChildren of Bodom, led by lead singer and lead guitarist Alexi Laiho, have definitely delivered on their trademark sound with Hatecrew. The album combines the blistering rhythms of Laiho and Alexander Kuoppola, with the lead parts of both Laiho and keyboardist, Janne Warman. The way these two work together in creating melodies and harmonies are second to none. Of course, Laiho is the primary songwriter in the group and therefore his presence in the band is pushed to the forefront, with incredible vai-like solo\u2019s that add an intensity to the song. \n\nHowever, there have been some complaints of becoming more commercial with their sound among the more hardcore fans. Hatecrew may, to some, seem to lack the edge of the previous albums, however, I don\u2019t see it. To me this album is at least as good as anything to come before it. The songwriting is beyond impressive on this album, and let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s what\u2019s really important. The melodies, which are of course what give CoB their signature sound, are top notch on this album. \nSome of the best of examples of this are on songs like Bodom Beach Terror. This song has an incredibly catchy chorus melody and then follows it up with a blistering stand-alone riff that helps add to the songs thrash feeling. \n\nThe first single from the album, Needled 24/7, is also a remarkable song. From the opening riff to the songs main melody this song completely captures the listener. The vocals on this song, while not clean, are cleaner than most have CoB songs and gives it an angrier, more bitter edge. Other great songs on the album would include Sixpounder, Better off Dead, Hatecrew Deathroll, and the slower (but not slow) Angels Don\u2019t Kill. \n\nThe only real complaint I have with this album is the same that I have with all CoB albums, and that is that the lyrics tend to get somewhat cheesy at times. They still aren\u2019t ultra-cheesy or anything of the like so it\u2019s not a huge problem. \n\nSo ignore the nay Sayers that are crying foul at this album and give it a listen for yourself. Hatecrew Deathroll is, in my opinion, just another strong case for CoB being the heirs to the throne of melodic death metal.\n",
        "\nThe first album by these Finnish power/speed-metal giants is definitely worth getting, just like everything else in their catalogue thus far. Not surprisingly, the COB album it's mostly comparable is the follow-up, \"Hatebreeder\", with lots of razor sharp and insanely fast single-note based riffs on a nearly constant full-frontal assault to kick your ass time and time again. Like all their releases, \"Something Wild\" takes frightening horror moods and almost psychotic, creepy atmospheres built up by some mesmerizing keyboard work, adds brutal aggression to the mixture with the monstrous riffwork and harsh vocals by Alexi Laiho that we all love or loathe.\n\nOn top of this, they put complex and quite unusual song arrangements that manage to keep the songs flowing well and constantly keeps the album fresh and surprising, while not being confused or incoherent in the slightest (Hi, Dream Theater). Though because of the frenetic moodswings and countless amounts of riffs in each and every song, they sometimes get a bit hard to tell apart from eachother. But when you listen to the album enough, it'll all sink in anyway. If you hear one part of the album randomly, you probably have no idea what song it is from, but you'll sure as hell know it kicks fucking ass.\nSome parts do stand out though, mainly some incredibly memorable and well-written melodies, like the one towards the end of \"In The Shadows\" or approximately 15 seconds into \"Red Light In My Eyes Part I\". Especially the main melody of the later song is amazing, never fails to give me goosebumps. Some incredible emotion conveyed into the whole song, really. The keyboard work of the band and on this album especially gives an almost melancholic edge to some moments of the album, which works surprisingly well with the intensity and aggression of the rest of the album, and Alexis vocals go perfectly with it. Again, check out the beginning of \"Red Light In My Eyes Part I\".\n\"Lake Bodom\" also has some fucking great moments. It starts with a magnificent keyboard melody, going into a melodic guitar riff which then takes us into total ownage mode throughout the entire song. Also note the brilliant keyboard solo, gotta love those.\n\nThe whole album though is filled with great moments all over, and there isn't really a weak moment on here, which is pretty fucking impressive considering the ever changing song structures. With this album, Children of Bodom took power metal to a new level, and brought us something that at the time, 1997, was quite unique (though bands like Sacred Warrior have used harsh vocals on power metal songs way back, it was not at all as overt as this) and more importantly, totally kickass. To name highlights is hard since the songs tend to blend together, but that's the only flaw I can find on this album, and since it's all great shit anyway that's not much of a problem.\nThe song structures are not quite as overwhelming, the keyboards not as perfectly atmospheric and the riffs not quite as menacing, as on the album that was to come two years later, \"Hatebreeder\". Nonetheless, this can definitely hold it's own against alot of classic metal records. Modern metal needs more bands like these, who have the balls to do something that's fresh and interesting, yet still kicks your ass like real metal should.\n\nAt the date of the writing of this review, it is 5 days until I see these mad finnish fuckers on the third day of Sweden Rock Festival, and oh Satan am I growing impatient or what? I'm expecting to get my ass kicked more times than you can count with both parts of your brain, both musically (all of it) and physically (Exodus).\n",
        "\nThis is simply an excellent album. Although missing the complete chaos that came with Hatebreeder, it still completely destroys nearly all melodic death and power metal albums. One of the main reasons for this is Alexi Laiho. Alexi, besides being a kickass vocalist, is simply an amazing guitarist. The solos have improved since Hatebreeder, both guitar and keyboard. The keyboards are also great on this album; more prominent than on Hatebreeder, but never taking away from the guitar, as they do in some bands that use them. Completed with solid drumming and rhythm guitar good for headbanging, and we have a kickass album.\n\nBodom After Midnight, Children of Decadence, Northern Comfort and Kissing the Shadows are all among the best songs on this album, and in all of Bodom's career. Bodom After Midnight has some great riffs and keyboard solos. Children of Decadence is perhaps the most straightforward song on here (verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus style) but manages to overcome the repetition with the fact that its full of amazing leads. Northern Comfort is different from anything on this album. It reminds me of one of the better songs on Hate Crew Deathroll... more riff oriented than lead oriented. Nevertheless, there are some great leads in this song. And then there's Kissing the Shadows, the best song Bodom ever made. This song is absolutely incredible. The variety of riffs and leads, the quality of the riffs and leads, and of course, one of the best solos I have ever heard. This solo, lasting around a minute and a half, shows us once again that fuck, Alexi and Warman (keyboards) can solo.\n\nThe weaker songs... the cover of the W.A.S.P song Hellion is pretty weak. The covers of Shot in the Dark and Don't Stop at the Top are much better, so if you get a chance, get a copy with one of those covers on it. Taste My Scythe is the weakest of the Bodom songs... no riff or lead thats in there that makes me want to listen to it over and over. Still a good song.\n\nThis and Hatebreeder are the two best Bodom albums out at the moment. If you want a tamer version of Hatebreeder that's equal in quality, then get this album immediately. If Bodom's only appeal to you is their chaos, then this CD is not for you.\n",
        "\nChildren of Bodom are definitive masters at what they do. What they do or what niche do they fit into you may ask. Well there is no easy answer, but for a best fit description I would say that COB blend almost Bach like masterpeices and add aggression with plenty of ballsy hate that is going to leave you metal fanatics begging for more. COB (the name taken from a murder in their hometown) immerged in 1997 with their outstandingly unique \"Something Wild\" album that took the extreme metal world by storm. Their creative use of keyboards and guitar riffery won them many fans. The back to back guitar/keyboard solos are very impressive to say the least and I'd say since COB first started there have been quite a few bands trying to immitate this sound, but most have either did a pretty good job or failed miserably. Hatebreeder is a continuation of their maped out Something Wild sound but is more refined and mature than Wild. The hooks with Hatebreeder are fucking stellar as well, this album is merely flawless, the production is great, and obviously the musicianship is all there. Alexi's death vocals are unique, and somehow they never get anoying, although at times you wonder if they are even there. The music really takes a hold of your mood, so sometimes the singing is left in the background. Most rate this their finest release to date and i don't blame the majority but I do opt for Follow the Reaper as their greatest accomplishment, as this is a close second. Warheart breaks the album in nicely with some speed metal slashing and hacking, the double bass flailing. You know what your in for once you hear Warheart, some outstanding Melodic Death Metal. I would compare this album to Carcass's Heartwork, i think that is the best example i can give. These guys are the kings at getting you pissed off, or if your already plunged into that mood, their music almost puts the listener in a trance where you feel like you should hate everything and everyone. Crazy that music can have that effect on people. The bach like influences are very evident with this release just like Something Wild and Follow The Reaper, but that is what makes these guys so good. Have you ever heard a Melodic Death metal band use Classical infuences and actually try and reinact what the composer did on a guitar? Listen to Hatebreeder and im sure you'll all understand what Im talking about. Hatebreeder should be enjoyed at it's loudest possible volume. \nCheers\n\nBest Tracks: Warheart, Silent Night Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, Towards Dead End, Black Widow, Children of Bodom, Downfall\n",
        "\nThe follow-up to 1999's Hatebreeder made quite big changes in Children of Bodom's musical direction, even though the basic ideas stayed the same; to have keyboards, melodic leadwork and menacing riffs in a tightly structured assault of violent metal, with catchy varying drum beats, insane double bass and Alexi Laiho's monstrous shrieking vocals on top of it all. The bass is still not very obvious in the mix, as the guitars and keyboards are still the main point, but it is quite obvious at several moments and complements well the dark feeling the album induces.\nThe biggest change from Hatebreeder to Follow The Reaper is, as you've probably figured by now, the change of tempo. While Hatebreeder featured pure fucking riff-madness with tons and tons of (often single-note based) speed metal riffs, Follow The Reaper slows down the pace. Thus, more focus is put onto the atmosphere on this album, and it also leaves place for a little more variety in the riffwork. Nonetheless, this is still pretty fucking fast- Every Time I Die is probably the slowest song they've ever done, but it's still clearly above midpaced.\nAnother notable change is the song constructions- in Hatebreeder, the guitars and keyboards pretty much worked together and was constructed as a double assault, while on this album you can notice several times when the keyboards pretty much disappear to enhance a certain riff to it's full potential, or vice versa. Children of Decadence, Mask of Sanity and Every Time I Die are good examples of this.\nAlso, while the instrumental sections on Hatebreeder were pretty much bonded together by tons of leadwork, Follow The Reaper instead features a whole fuckload of solos, both by guitars and keyboards.\n\n\nSo Follow The Reaper made quite a big change for the band, and it does not disappoint at all. Like any Children of Bodom album, there's so much going on at all times so it takes quite a while of heavy listening to fully comprehend the entire album, which is what's great about the band. You always keep discovering new good things about each song, and you never know what's coming next. The songs themselves also take some time to separate from eachother as the general musical direction and the consistently high pace of the songs don't leave much room for variation or personality, but if you listen to the album enough times, then you'll see that each song has distinguishing characteristics.\nIt's also a very consistent album, with no really weak tracks at all. But some of them do stand out as definitive highlights. Among them we have Every Time I Die, which has a really effective atmosphere set up by smoothly played keyboards. Also mentionable is Mask of Sanity, which has verses alternating between normally paced (for this album, anyway) and total Hatebreeder-madness. Also Taste of my Scythe, which has some really memorable melodies, and the closing track Kissing The Shadows, which has awesome galloping under-chorus riffs and a really fucking nuts solo section: It goes through three guitar solos and two keyboard solos, and provide a completely maddening closing section for the album.\nBut the definite highlight found on here is definitely Children of Decadence. It has the most memorable and catchy vocal lines (\"We're children of rebellion, we'll fight, we'll bleed!\"), some of the coolest keyboard melodies, and this one insanely heavy guitar riff.\n\nBut really, it's all very good. You'd better get this or you'll be missing out. It's no Hatebreeder, but definitely a worthwhile purchase.\nFor increased listening pleasure and atmosphere, try listening to a Children of Bodom album with respectively colored lightbulbs, in this case blue...\n",
        "\nHate Crew Deathroll is a logical progression from Hatebreeder to Follow the Reaper to this. Unfortunately, the logical progrssion is definitely not what is in the band's best interest.\n\nIt's slower and it's more fake. The overall tempo of the songs is much lower than either Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper. Raatikainen is still pounding away on his drums at lightning fast speeds, but the guitars don't seem to be matching the speed anymore, and the keyboards are turning into little industrial-sounding background elements, which is not what Warman is here for. Worst of all is that Alexi's amazingly brutal vocals are distorted to the point that this albums sounds more like an album from The Kovenant, and while I don't necessarily hate The Kovenant's sound, I don't appreciate the bastardization of Alexi's vocals.\n\nThe worst example of this self-mutilation is on Needled 24/7, which is a terrible mix of a bastardized Wheel of Time riff and a cover to Nagash's new sound. The other really bad abuse case happens in the overly-synthetic sounding Chokehold (Cocked 'n Loaded), which just completely branches off from the Children of Bodom that we know and love.\n\nFortunately, the band gets its shit together and puts out more of the stuff that made them so popular in the first place later in the album. Bodom Beach Terror features a standard drum machine rhythm in the beginning, but it progresses into a very respectable Children of Bodom song, although I wish the keyboards weren't as sappy as the are in the choruses. You're Better Off Dead goes straight back into the fast-as-fuck days of Children of Bodom that we all know and love, and you can safely start headbanging again to some thrashy classics. Hate Crew Deathroll follows the Downfall blueprint to create a very thrashy song that is very much worth the pounding around that you will be doing to it.\n\nIt's got some good songs, and since the bonus songs are also decent, the album is worth the purchase for fans. It's definitely not old-school Bodom, however, so don't expect another Hatebreeder or Follow the Reaper.\n",
        "\nIt's official. Hard, ass-kicking metal simply does not get any better than Children of Bodom. With the release of their third full-length masterpiece of brutality and harshness, the band has officially established themselves as the benchmark for both harsh vocals and intense guitar riffage, blowing the shit out of all but the best harsh bands.\n\nIt's all here, and it's all great. Alexi Laiho features both harsh-as-fuck vocals and incredible guitar playing. Janne Warman is constantly kicking ass on the keyboard, whether it's with his mirroring of Laiho's guitar riffs or his fast-as-a-flying-fucker solos. Blacksmith's bass work is incredible and features all of the talents of this amazing and underappreciated bassist while still remaining under the main instruments. Finally, Raatikainen is constantly pumping out a new beat that manages to both keep the music intersting and push it along at light speed at the same time.\n\nThe overall speed is a bit slower than Hatebreeder, but what is lost in blinding speed is made up for in pure fucking riffage that forces you into a death spiral of nonstop headbanging. All of Children of Bodom's signature stylistic stuff is on here, though, including the lightning-fast guitar and keyboard solos, the thrashy, pounding beat with riffs and chord progressions that could have come out of a twisted, evil Stratovarius. Everything in here is just solid style, topped off by Laiho's amazingly addictive harsh vocals that blend in seamlessly with the music instead of sticking out like a sore thumb, as many harsh vocalists tend to do.\n\nHighlights. Bodom after Midnight is very catchy and features quite an amazing selection of riffs and solo numbers. Children of Decadence has one of the coolest opening riffs that I have ever heard on a Children of Bodom album, and it is yet another indication of the primary intention of the band--to make you headband until you can no longer hear the music. Mask of Sanity sounds a bit like Downfall at first, but it quckly progresses into a unique combination of riffs centering on a main theme, and the soaring guitar notes will have you wetting your pants. Finally, Hate Me! sounds like something off an Alfred Hitchcock film, and could be perhaps the most Power Metal-oriented song in terms of key and general chord progressions, although those amazingly brutal harsh vocals won't have you confusing this band with Sonata Arctica anytime soon.\n\nI liked Hatebreeder better, but Children of Bodom fans definitely won't want to miss out on this spectacular performance by the Hate Crew.\n",
        "\nThis is the beginning of one of the coolest bands to ever hit the metal scene, and it features all the shit that makes them the band that all other harsh bands want to be when they grow up.\n\nChildren of Bodom has become legendary in the metal world for their combination of amazing technical skills and their shit-kicking attitude, and you can hear all of their greatness in this well-made album. The band's sound isn't as mature as it is by the time we get to Hatebreeder, but it's a great debut album and it happens to feature one of the great Children of Bodom classics.\n\nThe most important part of Children of Bodom is the absolutely ass-kicking lineup they have. First and foremost is Alexi Laiho, who I would very simplistically describe as a harsh Kai Hansen, although there is a lot of hatred and hyperfast brutality in Laiho that you won't find in any of King Kai's numerous endeavors. Laiho is, frankly, the King of Harsh Vocals, and nobody, no matter what genre they play in, can even come close to his completely brutal supremacy. The only thing as impressive as Laiho's vocals is his guitar playing, which is extremely virtuosic and incredibly fast (for a view on just how fast, check out his guitar solo in War of Roses in the Tokyo Wearhearts live album. The next member of importance is bassist Henkka Blacksmith, whose talents only shine through marginally on this album, but prove useful in keeping the fast-as-fuck style of Children of Bodom to a steady, headbanging beat. Next is the recently-departed Jaska Raatikainen, the fastest drummer this side of The Berzerker and infinitely more talented than the aforementioned. His drumming is solid and headbanging, no question asked. Rounding out the lineup is Janne Warman, whose lightning-fast keyboarding is in the band for the sole purpose of blowing you the fuck away by realizing just how fucking fast this dude is tearing off his solos (really fucking fast, in case you weren't sure).\n\nAs I said, this album marks the maiden voyage of the Hate Crew, and it features some excellent songs to mark their blazing emergence into the metal world. Deadnight Warrior opens up with a little sound clip that suddenly dies to give way to a hyperfast drum thrash, and then some serious opening riffage from the guitar as the band works its way to the main headbanging chorus. In the Shadows is notable for its showcasing of Blacksmith's excellent bass work. The killer song on here is Lake Bodom, a classic Children of Bodom song which I assume is about the Lake Bodom murders (you can never tell with harsh vocals), but who the fuck cares, anyway? The important thing is that the riffage in here is extraordinary and you will quickly be thrashing your ass off. The other song of note is Touch Like the Angel of Death, which has a very cool opening guitar riff that leads into some great howls from Alexi as the keyboard joins in the can-do-no-wrong riff frenzy.\n\nIf you can handle harsh vocals at all, buy this motherfucker right now. This is the sort of fast-paced brutal shit you want firmly in your collection. Black Metal-heads who live and die by the next Mayhem release might also want to hear what real brutality sounds like. This album, and this band, is the shit-ruling shit-kicker masterpiece that you need to hear RIGHT NOW.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard Children of Bodom, the style blew me away -- it was a very progressive styles done in a very aggressive manner. The fact that most of them were about 18 years old when this was done was far more impressive. Most of the best electric guitarists of all time out there either are faded into obscuraty in their 40s, dead, or sold out, and kids today need someone other than Korn, Tool, Creed, Slipknot, and new Metallica to look up to as the pinnacle of guitar ability.\n\nThis album has slight black metal influences, and the vocals are somewhat raspy in their harshness, but it has absolutely nothing to do with the genre at all. It's also obviously not the most serious work out there, but \n\nDeadnight Warrior just leaps out of the thunder with a fast, memorable introduction of complimentary keyboards and guitars. Alexi's harsh, screamed, unintelligible vocals punctures the song, keeping is rapid pace and providing contrast and conflict to the melodies. The all too brief sweep-picking solo on this song is killer.\n\nIn the Shadows begins with utter fury, with polyrythms creating chaos among the quasi-evil riffs. The song continues to speed up and slow down, but remains intense even with all the neoclassical work.\n\nRed Light in My Eyes Pt. 1 begins with a harpsichord of dissonance, and slows down into some really off-key, funny growling, which soon picks up and just as quickly returns to its neoclassical nature. The funny vocals return, but before you can laugh, you are twisted upside down again with a furious barrage of drums and diminished riffs. The too-brief solo is amazingly fast, though.\n\nRed Light Part 2 begins with a Malmsteen-style flourish and continues in much of the neoclassical style, reaching a crescendo of the scream of \"FIRE!\" The melodic guitar and keyboard work through this whole song is excellent, as intense as it stays.\n\nLake Bodom begins with a legendary intro of dueling keyboards and guitars, and would make almost any guitarist want to grab his axe and try to imitate it right away. The main song is intense and complex as usual, which only whets your appetite for a return of the intro. The guitar and keyboard solos are excellent rapid-speed, and help reach the pinnacle.\n\nThe Nail continues with the intense fusion of neoclassical styles and eclectic thrash/speed styling. Though it's heavy and fast to begin with, it gradually grows faster and reaches a climax of melodic fury after inventive riffs that showcase just how good the children in CoB really are.\n\nTouch Like Angel of Death finishes the album with a simple rythm upon ghostly keyboards, slows down, and picks right up with an excellent high-speed melody and a very catchy (although typical CoB stupid/funny in lyrical content) and crushing chorus. The skilled and fast solo fits exactly right as usual. The only thing I don't like is the silence and the little keyboard thing at the end.\n\nI'm giving this album a 90 because it's not perfect and it's a bit too short, but it's is damned good. It ushers in something new which I actually happen to like for a change, and those kids can play their instruments with amazing ability, know their music theory, and know how to make something memorable out of it.\n",
        "\nThis album is fucking insane! Riff after riff and note after of note of pure madness and total fucking hatred combine to make a fucking amazing masterpiece of epic proportions.\n\nLet me stress that while this album is so fucking fast and powerful that the slowest song will be giving you whiplash within 30 seconds, it is not TOO fast. TOO fast is something like The Berzerker, or like that turdsucking subgenre known as Grindcore, where the band is playing so damn fast that a) every song sounds exactly the same; and b) that sound is the sound of a drum going at 500 rpm's and maybe, if you listen closely, some unrefined howling by a desperate vocalist. This baby is fast enough to thrash you straight into next year, while being manageable enough to create completely different sounds and bring out the full talents of Alexi Laiho, who is without a doubt one of the best harsh vocalists of all time (not to mention a fucking insane guitarist and, judging from the band bio, a fellow Stratovarius fanatic).\n\nThe riffs here are monstrous. Alexi is simply kicking ass nonstop. If he isn't pumping out riff after riff, it's because he's too busy playing an insanely fast solo on top of a solid bass/drum line. Every song introduces a new plethora of riffage guaranteed to blow you away, leaving your throttled, lifeless corpse still headbanging away into nothingness. The keyboard doesn't fuck with the brutality of the album at all. It exists for one purpose and one purpose alone: to kick the shit out of you with lightspeed solos. It works. The sheer speed of notes coming from the keyboard is unlike anything I have ever heard. They throw in the occasional bass solo, but it doesn't overwhelm the song and fits in well with the general ass-kicking nature of the songs. The drummer is inredible; he is one of the few drummers I know who can pump out meatbeats while playing an actual rhythm at the same time, all the while allowing the guitars and bass to play above him, something The Berzerker's drummer desperately needs to learn.\n\nThe coolest song on here is without a doubt Downfall, which is the aforementioned slowest song on the album, though I guarantee you will be headbanging like a monster the moment the guitar comes in. The melody is brutal on here, and the riffs are unbelievable.\n\nThe only downfall (no pun intended) of the album is its length. It's far too short for an album, but hey, they have to catch their breath after a while, right?\n\nIf you can handle Alexi's harsh vocals, buy this album right fucking now. I recommend, however, that you not play this CD while in heavy traffic, or you may find yourself accused of a few murders before the day is out. You'll know what I mean when you hear it.\n",
        "\nIf I was at this concert, I would be a little pissed. It's very short. 9 songs, 1 solo battle and an Introduction. That's about half the length of your standard live show. Not to say that there aren't some cool points, such as when Alexi Laiho announces that \"We're Children of Bodom and we come from FUCKING FINLAND!!\" Overall, however, the live show was short, and when I go to concerts I expect to make an evening out of it.\n\nBut I wasn't there, and so I can give the opinion of those who listen to the CD: This is Children of Bodom at their most ass-kicking. And that's saying something. Tokyo Wearhearts is what I would call the perfect Children of Bodom CD--taking a \"Best of\" CD and adding the excitement of a very well-done live album. This has all the great Children of Bodom classics, including Silent Night, Bodom Night and Lake Bodom, and it features their latest hit, the somewhat slower (though not by much) Downfall. The album also includes a collection of lesser-known but equally cool songs, including the title track from their new album, Warheart, and Deadnight Warrior, a song from their first album. Topping it off is the fantastic solo battle entitled War of Razors, which includes perhaps the fastest few seconds of guitar playing that I've ever heard.\n\nI don't like harsh vocals. I'll put that out in the open: I see no merit in growiling out unintelligible noise when there are great bands like Iced Earth singing in harsh, pissed off voices that still sport clean vocals. That being said, Children of Bodom manages to make their growls sound good, and in combination with the fast-as-hell instruments, the growling almost seems appropriate for the setting. And coming from me, that's really saying something.\n\nGet this live album now. It is without a doubt one of the best performances ever put on CD by a unique, yet incredible Power Metal band.\n",
        "\nThis single is quite a short, but good representation of the Hate Crew Deathroll album. The title song is typically Bodom. It starts off with some frenetical drumming and Alexi screaming \"War Eyes\". The keyboards are playing along masterfully with the brilliant riffs. The song calms down at 1:44, but speeds up again at 2:30. The lyrics are burning with hatred as always, and the refrain is quite catchy. \"You're better off dead than fucking with me!\" says it all. \n\nNext we have the Ramones cover, Somebody Put Something In My Drink. A very cathy song (my favorite Ramones song), which is quite suitable to listen to, during binge-drinking :) An excellent cover version. If you've heard the original, you might notice that CoB has changed the lyrics. The original goes as follows: \"Daiqury and Tonic's my favorite drink\", while CoB goes \"Vodka and Tonic's...\". Vodka & Tonic is infact Alexi's favorite drink :) A little CoB trivia..\n\nThe only thing that pulls the score down a bit, is the fact that this release could contained aome more material, i.e a video or a live song. Anyways, it's well worth buying because of the cover song.\n",
        "\nNow that this album has been released in a standard jewel case, it's easier to find than the box set it was originally released in. It doesn't have any of the extras that the box set has, however - just photos of each of the band members and a few lyrics snippets here and there (including a few from songs off of Something Wild).\n\nSo how is the album itself? Well, it's a very tight performance from CoB, with few mistakes. Since it was recorded right after Hatebreeder came out, it only has songs from their first two albums. The song selection is pretty good...obviously there are a few songs that every CoB fan would want to hear that aren't on the tracklist, but on the whole it's a decent collection.\n\nAlexi's vocals are decent live. Obviously he's concentrating on playing guitar, which he is extremely good at, even live. He glides through the solos at full speed effortlessly, even throwing in a few quick licks in here and there that aren't on the studio versions of the songs. Everyone else in the band is also in top form, particularly Jaska's drumming. Alexi's stage chatter comes after every song, and while it's a tad goofy at times it's nothing you wouldn't hear at your average metal concert. He speaks English surprisingly well.\n\nFans of Children of Bodom's other albums will most likely enjoy this album. Personally I'd recommend it over Something Wild because the tracks from that album on here are at least as good as the album versions, and in some cases better (like Deadnight Warrior). For the collectors out there, there's also a track called \"War of Razors\" that is only on this album. It's basically Alexi and Janne (and maybe Alexander?) shredding it up like there's no tomorrow. If you don't like CoB's other albums, you're probably not gonna dig this one, but otherwise it's definitely worth checking out. My favorite songs are \"Silent Night, Bodom Night\", \"Lake Bodom\", and \"Downfall\".\n",
        "\nThe new Children of Bodom album is definitely no disappointment, although it sure is no Hatebreeder. It\u2019s neither as fast nor as insane as Hatebreeder, but it\u2019s still for the most part pretty damn fast and insane. I only have two CoB albums as of yet (Hate Crew and Hatebreeder, obviously) but I\u2019ve heard some songs from Follow The Reaper. This one is a bit faster than what I\u2019ve heard of FTR, but it\u2019s more focused than the devastating Hatebreeder, and it has more melodic parts.\n\nThe usage of keyboards is much different from the previous releases. Occasionally it takes a sound similar to that of Nightwish, like during the intro to Sixpounder, for instance, and it\u2019s often used to create haunting melodies in the background, but now there are also more keyboard solos than on Hatebreeder. The guitarwork is still heavy and fast as fuck, but it\u2019s not quite as dark as that of Hatebreeder, and there are some songs that are quite uplifting, in a strange kind of way. We are also delivered shitloads of blazing solos, just as one would expect.\n\nThe bass is not as low in the mix as before, so we can see that they have a pretty talented bass player, even though he mostly just follows along with the guitars. The drumming is intense as really tight, as always. The biggest change from previous albums to this one was the vocals. While Alexi Wildchild Laiho still shrieks his heart out, but there are more clean vocals, like the ones that can be found on the chorus of the Hatebreeder title track. It\u2019s used mainly on choruses (Needled 24/7 for example) and is used very effectively, and provides some very nice singalong moments.\n\nAlso, there is some very tasteful usage of backing vocals on some of the choruses, like Triple Corpse Hammerblow, You\u2019re Better Off Dead and the title track, which makes them more memorable. Another thing that has improved is the individual tracks. Some of the Hatebreeder songs sounded pretty much the same, and they didn\u2019t have a lot of personality, but that\u2019s not much of a problem here. Most of the songs have their own sound, and don\u2019t blend into each other easily.\n\nStill, this album is not all perfect. It\u2019s not quite as all-out lethal as Hatebreeder, and the song constructions are not as interesting anymore, as they usually follow quite similar patterns, and if they don\u2019t they tend to get slightly forgettable.\n\nAnother thing that really annoys me is the pre-chorus of Needled 24/4. The clean vocals there sound really bad and whiny, and the silly keyboard effects sound like something from a fucking Korn song!\n\nTo name a few song highlights, I\u2019d say Bodom Beach Terror (insane verses and apocalyptic keyboards), Triple Corpse Hammerblow (catchy-as-fuck chorus and amazing usage of haunting keyboard melodies), You\u2019re Better Off Dead (catchiest song on here, with the \u201cooh ooh\u201d backing vocals in the chorus) and the title track (insane guitar riffing and great usage of backing vocals in the chorus).\n\nHmm\u2026 Seems like I named almost half of the album as the highlights. To narrow down the list, the two absolutely greatest songs would have to be Triple Corpse Hammerblow and Hate Crew Deathroll. The weakest songs are probably Chokehold (boring song construction and very, very forgettable vocal lines. Not terrible, just pretty boring) and Angel\u2019s Don\u2019t Kill (the dark chorus is very cool, but otherwise it\u2019s just too slow and melodic for it\u2019s own good- sure, Children of Bodom are supposed to be melodic but the melodies are too bright and uplifting for this song).\n\nThis is a really fucking solid release, despite a few minor flaws that appear. The large amount of clean vocals and backing vocals might catch you off guard at first, but soon you should notice that it fits in very well with the musical direction the album has taken, and adds a lot to the songs.\n",
        "\n\"From now on, we are enemies. You and I.\" Thus begins Hatebreeder, an album packed with intensity, melody and pure hatred.\nThis is definitely an amazing album, and definitely one of the best I've bought lately.\nThe guitar riffing is absolutely excellent. Dark, heavy and insanely fast riffs build a strong spine for this album. They're rarely very memorable, but that's not their point. Their point is to brutally tear you apart over and over again, and that's exactly what they do.\nThe usually quite high toned lead guitars and the atmospheric keyboard melodies create an amazing contrast to the dark riffs.\nThe bass is quite low and is often hard to hear, but we get some really sweet bass parts, like the one in the beginning of the opening track Warheart.\nThe drummer Jaska Raalikainen is absolutely insane. He delivers mindblowing double bass onslaughts all the fucking time, and does it very tight. He does everything with excellent precision, and the drum patterns rarely stays the same for more than 10 seconds.\nOn top of it all, we have the shrieky vocals of Alexi 'Wildchild' Laiho (who is also the lead guitarist). His vocals and the heavy riffs mixed with the high toned lead guitars and melodic keyboards make Children of Bodom a fresh and original sounding band, and a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe songs are interesting and don't get boring, as all songs are built in different ways, and the order of the verses, bridges, choruses and solos is not in the slightest predictable, but it all fits very right. Riff changes are all over each and every song of the album, keeping the songs interesting and varied.\n\nThere are a few downsides though. The biggest one is that the songs in themselves don't really have much personality and some parts sound somewhat the same in different songs. But this band doesn't really need personality in their songs, that's not their main point. Their main target is to create asskicking brutal riffage accompanied by an amazing atmosphere, and they do it just right.\n\nThe lyrics are among the less intelligent I've read in my life. They are about hate, war, death, pain and other happy and uplifting subjects... Yeah...\nBut the lyrics fit well with the dark music and as Alexi Laiho has stated but which some people fail to realize is that the lyrics are not at all serious, and must be taken with a grain of salt.\n\n\nNow, to the highlights of the album.\nIt's quite hard to name highlights as most songs sound quite similar and are therefore all equally asskicking, but if I had to choose one favourite, I think it would be Bed of Razors. Every instrument works perfect, and the haunting keyboard intro is very memorable and creates a killer atmosphere, which the song maintains all through. Other excellent songs are the opener Warheart, the brutal title track, and the final track Downfall, which has another great, atmospheric intro.\nI think Wrath Within is slightly weaker than the rest, simply because the riffs aren't quite as crushingly great and the melodies aren't quite as memorable.\nIt's very good nonetheless.\n\nAll in all, what we have here is a masterpiece of an album that should please the ears of most listeners, as long as you don't have anything against the shrieky vocals. The album has insanity and atmosphere mixed together in a way rarely, if ever, matched before.\n",
        "\nThis is definitely a very overwhelming album - there is just so much going on at all times, so either you're gonna love it, or hate it. This takes the speed elements of power metal, and combines them with many layers of guitar work, and some pretty harsh vocals, creating a sound that was, well, at the time anyway, pretty unique. \n\nAgain, this album is just fucking relentless - they don't drop below about 240 beats per minute until the intro to the last song, Downfall. Other than that - it's just insane guitar and keyboard work, with some really great shredding solos. \"Warheart\" and \"Towards Dead End\" have some especially magnificent soloing, with some pretty good sense of melodic progression - fast as fuck, without becoming incoherent. There really can be found here a quantity of riffs that is best described as \"a whole fucking motherfucking shitload, and then some\". There's 75 minutes of music here, except smashed into 40 minutes. You will bang your head until it fucking falls off. Then enjoy the crazy keyboards, and the shredding solos, and of course the insanely fast riff work.\n\nDid I mention it was fast? Well, if I didn't... it's really fucking fast. You will have the worst case of whiplash ever if you try to headbang to this album. Imagine Reign in Blood meets Yngwie Malmsteen. Fucking insane.\n"
