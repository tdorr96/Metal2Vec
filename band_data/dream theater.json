        "\nReviewing a single (in this case, just one song) can be even more hard and complex than reviewing a whole album since you are analysing the whole song whereas in an album review you wouldn't go much in depth (i.e most of the people don't go track-by-track here and it's even discouraged in the website). Cutting to the chase, Afterlife by Dream Theater is possibly the best DT song ever composed by them. An excellent song.\n\nBefore getting into it in depth, I must say this song manages to mix the USPM fast riffing and melodies with the quirkiness and virtuosity of the then-unknown Prog Metal of Dream Theater. The philosophical lyrics written by Charlie Dominici deal with the afterlife (duh) and are sung with a voice who would annoy some, but in my opinion they fit the song like a glove. Dominici's voice and lyrics plus the whole instrumental creates an oneiric atmosphere where dream and day unite. What I love about music is when both the instrumental and lyrics are consistent with what they are explaining. For example, even if you take out Ron Rinehart's voice in Leave Scars (the title track) you'd probably guess and feel what is the song about. The energy this song has, given by the keyboards and the guitar, provide a beautiful constant melody where it seems like I'm in a dream, or maybe in the afterlife.\n\nThe bass and drums by Myung and Portnoy are the strong backbone of this song. This album is possibly the one with the most notable bass and it really goes hand in hand with everything. I favour the production as well (although many have criticised, I like the \"bad quality\" of it, sounds just like a Fates Warning album and gives it more raw power), everything sounds just fine and nothing is left out. And how could I forget the solo? It starts pretty strong and just kinda literally explodes into a dual keyboard-guitar solo by Petrucci and Moore. Flabbergasting.\n\nThis single is perfect, but you should really check the whole album as well.\n",
        "\nHere I am once again, reviewing what is without a doubt the best Dream Theater album. Recalling DT history, after the band changed the name from Majesty to Dream Theater (they got the name after Mike Portnoys' father's cinema, the owner in Portnoy's hometown. Everybody knows that story) and found the great Charlie Dominici, they decided to get in the studio and record an album under the auspices of producing master Terry Date who was yet to become well-known by the mainstream. Though sooner or later that did happen after he worked with bands such as Pantera and.....uhhhhh I hate to say that name so I'll just add all the letters and you'll guess it. It's like playing hangman. The band in question is L _ _ P B_ Z _ _ T.\n\nBut enough of my bickering. It is time for me to dive into the album and explain why I truly love this record. There is only one word that would describe this album. M-A-J-E-S-T-I-C. This record truly has majestic compositions, majestic arrangements, and majestic (and quite elegant I'd say) sound. All of the songs could have easily been included in a movie scene where the mythical phoenix is rising from its ashes. It's no wonder that visionary Kevin Moore would go on to work on film and video game soundtracks. Oh boy, let's talk a bit about Kevin Moore. The man is a fantastic musician and performer, with him playing a lot of spectacular fast synthesizer leads, and when it comes to the rhythm, he knows how to blend in different eastern melodies and chords with those that sound more proggy and I admire the fact that he follows some of Petrucci's fastest parts with ease.\n\nOf course, John Petrucci was (and still is, don't get me wrong) one of the best guitarists the world had to offer and in the 80's he was without a doubt a formidable opponent/rival to Paul Gilbert, Tony Macalpine, Jason Becker and many others. He doesn't play his guitar randomly but every note that comes out of it in this album is played very calculatedly and with a lot of feel and emotion. He and the rest of the Dream Theater crew that perform here are extremely talented, and gifted and have sweated blood to reach where they were and still are to this day. To change the subject a little bit, this is the only album I remember which has a very fast tempo. This is evident from the songs \u201cA Fortune In Lies\u201d, \u201cOnly A Matter Of Time\u201d and a few others. I guess they ditched the power metal drums on their next albums because Labrie couldn't keep up.\n\nAnother thing I like about this album is how John Myung plays his bass with \u201cstuffing\u201d. I don't know if it's the tone that he chose or if he uses his hand to mute the strings a bit. Certainly, it helps Charlie Dominici not go off in tempo. Dominici, of course, has a one-of-a-kind singing voice and is one of my favourite singers and in my opinion, the best singer Dream Theater ever had. And please, I don't want to hear any comments about him singing very flat and having no range. At least he doesn't sound like a teenager, unlike Labrie. The lyrics he wrote for two of the songs in WDADU are also very sophisticated, with them describing life experiences the band had, (\u201cStatus Seeker\u201d) and philosophical life and death themes (\"Afterlife\").\n\nI can listen to WDADU in any mood I'm in, anywhere. I can still play \u201cAfterlife\u201d and \u201cStatus Seeker\u201d if I want to chill. When I work out. The music is very inspirational and all the songs fit perfectly for a unity of sessions at the gym. The only thing that I'm not really fond of is the album cover. I mean for a CD cover it is ok but for a shirt stamp, it would look pretty shitty.\n\nBest songs:\n\n\u201cThe Killing Hand\u201d\n\u201cOnly A Matter Of Time\u201d\n\u201cA Fortune In Lies\u201d\n",
        "\n\u2018Falling Into Infinity\u2019 is arguably Dream Theater\u2019s most controversial album. Allegedly, Elektra Records demanded a more radio-friendly album. In all honesty, it is difficult to picture any mid-nineties radio station having most of the material on \u2018Falling Into Infinity\u2019 on heavy rotation, with all the odd meters on display. There are a few more accessible tracks, but what Elektra\u2019s alleged demands did result in is an album that is closer to contemporary progressive rock than it is to the progressive metal of its three predecessors. And for what it\u2019s worth, I personally think Dream Theater does progressive rock better.\n\nIf Dream Theater was looking at successful nineties bands for inspiration, it seems like they mainly took it from the most prog-sounding bands, such as Soundgarden. There are nods to Alice In Chains (the vocal harmonies in the chorus of \u2018New Millennium\u2019) and Rage Against The Machine (the main riff to \u2018You Not Me\u2019), but the overall sound is fairly unique. Given the blatant Rush references on recent albums, one might assume Dream Theater would have looked to mid-nineties Rush for inspiration, but the compositions on \u2018Falling Into Infinity\u2019 are notably more complex. There is also plenty of room for instrumental virtuosity, though somewhat more reined in than before.\n\nThe album\u2019s reputation seems to suggest that there are no progressive moments on \u2018Falling Into Infinity\u2019, but the opposite is actually true. In fact, \u2018Lines In the Sand\u2019 is possibly the best prog song released in the nineties. It slowly builds from an atmospheric keyboard-only intro by relative newcomer Derek Sherinian to a powerful rock song that goes through multiple changes. The gospel-tinged backing vocals courtesy of King\u2019s X frontman Doug Pinnick are a great bonus. \u2018New Millennium\u2019 is another prog rock masterpiece and a fantastic opener, while \u2018Burning My Soul\u2019 and \u2018Just Let Me Breathe\u2019 are spirited rockers with cool rhythms.\n\nPower ballads generally aren\u2019t Dream Theater\u2019s forte, often devolving into overly schmaltzy AOR choruses, but there are actually a few good ones here. Lengthy closer \u2018Trial Of Tears\u2019 is a moody slow builder with some excellent proggy sections and \u2018Peruvian Skies\u2019 is a brooding track that makes brilliant use of climaxes \u2013 or rather anti-climaxes if we\u2019re splitting hairs \u2013 and easily the most nineties rock-sounding track on here. Even \u2018Hollow Years\u2019 and the Elton John-esque \u2018Anna Lee\u2019 are quite good, though both could have a minute chafed off without hurting the tracks. The instrumental interlude \u2018Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019 is excellent as well.\n\nAdmittedly, \u2018Falling Into Infinity\u2019 did not need to be seventy-eight minutes long. There is an even better fifty-five minute album in here somewhere. But it is far from the pop album its reputation sometimes seems to suggest it is. The songwriting resonates with me more than most of the wildly inconsitent \u2018Images And Words\u2019 and the first half of \u2018Awake\u2019 did. Compared to the latter, I actually like that guitarist John Petrucci doesn\u2019t chug on his lowest strings quite as much. If you go into \u2018Falling Into Infinity\u2019 with the right expectations, you will find a highly creative album that I rate as one of Dream Theater\u2019s top three albums.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Lines In The Sand\u2019, \u2018New Millennium\u2019, \u2018Trial Of Tears\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nUntil the release of their 2013 self-titled album, I think it\u2019s safe to say that Dream Theater were in a healthy musical position. Despite the enormous loss of original drummer and band leader Mike Portnoy in 2010, the band managed to pull things together and release a great album in 2011, A Dramatic Turn Of Events, showing the progressive metal world that there where still gas left in the tank and that they were a band that the fans could still count on. With the release of their 2013 self-titled album, this flow started to falter a little bit. Sure, the album was good and it had the DT essence surrounding it, but you could still feel that there was something different going on, something that made you concered of what the band\u2019s next move was. Little did we know that the next move would be one of the most inappropriate, useless and unnecessary albums released by a major band in the last 20 years, perhaps even of all time. I\u2019m refering to their 13th studio album, The Astonishing, which was released in 2016.\n\nWhen you look at the whole discography of Dream Theater, The Astonishing sticks out like a sore thumb in all ways possible. It\u2019s the album that has the most tracks, it\u2019s the album that has the longest runtime and it\u2019s by far their most ambitious project to date. A concept album, The Astonishing tells the story of\u2026 truth be told, I still haven\u2019t figured out what the concept is about. I know that it takes place in a dystopian future where music is forbidden and that there is a man, Gabriel, who is perceived as the saviour of the people because of his angelic voice. With the help of his voice, he will save the people from the tyrannic rule of Lord Nafaryus and create a world of peace and harmony. Don\u2019t quote me on this synopsis. It might as well be false. Like I said, I don\u2019t know what the concept is about. And truth be told, I don\u2019t care.\n\nThere are few things that work on this album, and the flaws are more than obvious. To keep things straight, I will narrow the flaws down to four points.\n\n1. The quantity of the album: The Astonishing consists of 34 (!) songs and has a runtime of 2 hours and 10 minutes. Who has the time to listen to an album of this length? Once or twice, fair enough, but on a regular basis? You can listen to 3\u20134 normal length albums in this timeframe.\n\n2. The quality of the album: I\u2019m going to say it straight out. The music isn\u2019t good enough. The fact that a band like Dream Theater, with albums like Images And Words, Metropolis Pt.2: Scenes From A Memory, Awake and Train Of Thought in their catalog, were able to reach such a low level of songwriting on The Astonishing is not only remarkable but also sad. There are musical themes that are repeated throughout the album, but every time they appear, I get the feeling that they appear just to remember the listener that they exist and that they are a part of a bigger narrarive, a narrative that, like I said before, is impossible to understand. At least for me. Does this mean that all the songs are crap? Of course not. Given the quantity of this album, it would be an achievement to release 100 % garbage. Of course there are songs that are good, sometimes even great, but they are few and far between, and considering the length of the album it\u2019s not worth taking the time to come to them. If I want to listen to songs from The Astonishing, which includes songs like \u201dOur New World\u201d, \u201dA New Beginning\u201d, \u201dDystopian Overture\u201d, \u201dThe X Aspect\u201d and \u201dMoment Of Betrayal\u201d, I listen to them individually. There are enjoyable sections in other songs as well, but as soon as they reach momentum and you think that something awesome will happen, that momentum is immediately destroyed by more mellow drivel.\n\n3. The sound of the album: Musically speaking, The Astonishing is more mellow than Dream Theater\u2019s other albums, relying more on orchestral and atmospherical soundscapes than on heavy riffs and technical mayhem. They even added strings and collaborated with a choir in order to meet these purposes. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this on paper but let\u2019s be real. Who wants to hear Dream Theater do ballads for 2 hours straight? More power to you if you do. I don\u2019t. When I listen to Dream Theater I want to hear heavy riffs, progressive chaos and occasionally a beautiful ballad. It was the combination of melodic beauty, heavy riffing and technical mastery that made me a fan of the band from the beginning, not just mellow nonsense. Many have jokingly called this album \u201dDisney Theater\u201d and I definitely approve on this. Considering the large amount of cheesy vocal lines, cringy lyrics and orchestral arrangements, I can almost imagine James LaBrie standing in a dress on a Broadway stage singning these songs. \n\n4. The concept is a mess: I have already explained this one so there\u2019s not much to add. The only thing that is worth adding is that the concept is basically a reboot of Rush\u2019s \u201d2112\u201d, but while Rush managed to tell a similiar story in 20 minutes and pack it in a context of stellar musicianship and lyrical genius, Dream Theater tell it in a 2+ hour long torment, to the point where they even fail to deliver a statisfying conclusion It\u2019s not like Dream Theater can\u2019t create concept albums. Their IMO best album, \u201dMetropolis Pt.2: Scenes From A Memory\u201d, is a concept album, but unlike The Astonishing, that album has a creative storyline that is easy to follow. It also has a cool plot twist towards the end, which lays the foundations for a statisfying conclusion. Sure, The Astonishing has a conclusion, but it\u2019s not a well-written one and when it comes, it definitely leaves a sour taste in the listener\u2019s mouth.\n\nAre there any redeeming qualities about The Astonishing? Yes, but you have to dig deep to find them. The clearest example of a qualified achievement can be found in the individual performances, especially the ones by vocalist James LaBrie and keyboardist Jordan Rudess. Labrie, despite the more than obvious vocal struggles he\u2019s had in recent years, manages to crank out an impressive performance, using his vocal abilities to narrate the stories of a large amount of characters. Given the circumstances, he shall be proud for his performance. So shall Jordan Rudess, whose playing on this album is much more melodic and mellow than on previous Dream Theater releases. The synthesizers are to a large extent replaced by pianos, which is a pleasant departure from the things that Rudess is normally associated with. Even though the album is a plague to listen to, I still applaude Rudess for going out of his comfort zone and delivering something different. It\u2019s a nice slap in the face for those who say that he\u2019s nothing but a shredder who lacks emotion and musical depth. \n\nThe big villian here, sadly, is guitarist John Petrucci. His playing isn\u2019t bad. I think it\u2019s physically impossible for John Petrucci to play bad. However, he wrote the lyrics and the majority of the music for this album and as the band\u2019s leader, he is the one responsible for the album and for all the flaws mentioned above. Yet, the biggest question remains: Why? Why would he do this? Why would he waste his, and the other member\u2019s, time, energy and talent on a mess like this? I can understand that he wants to do something different and broaden his creative framework but please\u2026 Don\u2019t denigrate Dream Theater\u2019s name with it. This album should had been released as a John Petrucci & Jordan Rudess solo album, a separate project that could have included a large amount of outside singers and musicians to narrate the concept. There was no reason to involve James LaBrie, John Myung and Mike Mangini in this project. \n\nWhen I think about The Astonishing, I realize how much Mike Portnoy was needed. Not as a drummer, but as a creative force and a conceptual leader. He was the brain of Dream Theater together with John Petrucci, and with him at the gears, this album would never have seen the light of day, at least not in the Dream Theater context. He would have said to Petrucci that this project was a misstep that would have been better thrown in the trash can. But he couldn\u2019t, and because of this, The Astonishing sticks out like a sore thumb in the Dream Theater cataloge, a wolf in sheep's clothing that haunts their discography and gives an otherwise perfect discography an unnecessary slap in the face.\n",
        "\nAfter bursting into the musical scene with their mandatory album Images and Words in 1992, Dream Theater were slowly starting to face the lands of turmoil. Having lost keyboardist and key member Kevin Moore in 1994, the band\u2019s two following albums, Awake and Falling Into Infinity, failed to make a commercial impact, putting the band that once changed the landscape of progressive music in a vulnerable position. At times, the tensions were so high that the band actually considered retirement. However, they decided to make one last attempt, playing all the cards that they had at hand. While the last album, Falling Into Infinity, was an album plagued by creative differences between the band and the record label, this time Dream Theater demanded creative freedom with zero tolerance for influence from outside actors. Adding to this, they decided to release keyboardist Derek Sherinian from his duties and replace him with Jordan Rudess, who had previously worked with drummer Mike Portnoy and guitarist John Petrucci in the side project Liquid Tension Experiment and was the keyboardist the band had wanted to add to their line-up for many years. With all these factors in place, the band finally went all in. And the result, Metropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory from 1999, was thereafter.\n\nThe music of Metropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory can be traced back to a lot of different events. On their breakthrough album, \u201dImages and Words\u201d, you can find a song called \u201dMetropolis pt.1: The Miracle And The Sleeper\u201d, which to this day remains a mandatory song for Dream Theater and the progressive metal genre as a whole. For many years the fans had demanded a follow up to that song. As a result of this, the band decided to write a 20+ minutes epic, called \u201dMetropolis pt.2\u201d, during the sessions of their previous album, Falling Into Infinity. Unfortunately, that epic was turned down by the record label. However, the band decided to use it as a basis for their next album, expanding on it\u2019s themes and musical ideas. The result was a full blown concept album that centers around Nicholas, a man who is haunted by nightmares and therefore seeks help from a therapist. This therapist puts Nicholas in a state of hypnotic trance, which makes him able to go back in time. In the past, he realizes that his soul once belonged to a woman namned Victoria, a woman who was murdered under mysterious circumstances. As the album goes on, Nicholas starts to find clues and becomes more and more aware of the truth, of what really happened to Victoria. I won\u2019t go further with the narrative. If you want to know what happens, I recommend you to listen to the album.\n\nThe concept of the album notwithstanding, what about the songs and the music? As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the stars where alligned when this album was written and recorded. The music of Dream Theater can more or less be described as a mixture of accessible vocal lines, advanced song structures, technical mastery, melodicism and heaviness, and all of this is appearant on Metropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory. Songs like \u201dThrough Her Eyes\u201d and \u201dStrange Deja Vu\u201d are accessible and memorable without sounding shallow and commercial, and with songs like \u201dBeyond This Life\u201d and \u201dHome\u201d you get a lot of bone-crushing riffs and thundering solos from John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess. There are also numerous references to the afromentioned song \u201dMetropolis pt.1: The Miracle And The Sleeper\u201d spread out over the album, which contributes to strengthen it's conceptual feel. However, for me the X factor of the album, together with it\u2019s lyrical content, is the technical mastery, something that was utilised partially on their previous albums but to a greater extent here. This can\u2019t exemplified better than by the instrumental \u201dThe Dance Of Eternity\u201d, which can be described as nothing but progressive chaos. With 100+ time signature changes in little more than 6 minutes, it can be considered as the moment where the virtuosity of Petrucci, Rudess, drummer Mike Portnoy and bassist John Myung comes to clearest expression. Watching them perform that song live is actually pretty scary.\n\nI think the addition of Jordan Rudess was the main reason why the band decided to step up in terms of technical mastery. Unlike Kevin Moore, whose playing style could be likened to the one of Richard Wright (Pink Floyd) or Tony Banks (Genesis), Rudess is more influenced by the ones of Rick Wakeman (Yes) and Keith Emerson (Emerson, Lake & Palmer). With Rudess at the gears, the keyboards are used more as lead instruments than with Moore, who mainly used them for melodic and atmospheric purposes. It\u2019s up to the listener to decide which style they prefer. However, I consider Rudess to be a more suitable choice considering the style of music Dream Theater started to play on this album (and has continued to play on subsequent releases). With Rudess, the technical opportunities are vastly superior to the ones they would have had with Kevin Moore, and this falls perfectly in line with the musical changes that band leaders John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy wanted to make. As far as I\u2019m concerned, the music of Metropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory falls more in line with the music of Liquid Tension Experiment than with the music of the first Dream Theater albums. Over time, this has led to the band being accused for doing \u201dmusical wankery\u201d and being \u201dfast and technical just for the sake of it\u201d. That might be true to some extent, but on this album it\u2019s not applicable, at least not for me. Sure, there is technical chaos spread out over the album, but all of it makes sense and it doesn\u2019t go over the songwriting. If anything, this album is written and performed with a precision that is remarkable, and that alone gives the album a special and magical aura. When you listen to Metropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory, you can feel that there is something special going on, something that will give the band the artistic credit the wanted and deserved. \n\nMetropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory might not be Dream Theater\u2019s most commercially successful album, but it doesn\u2019t matter. From an artistic standpoint, this is, and will always be, their crowning achievement. At least for me. They played all their cards and they won. They escaped from the shadows of musical death and showed that they weren\u2019t a one album wonder. If Images And Words was the album that made Dream Theater popular, Metropolis pt.2: Scenes From A Memory was the album that cemented them as progressive music essentials. It made the band restore their balance and confidence, both in the eyes of themselves and in the eyes of their fans. As a fan, I won\u2019t hesitate to rank this album as one of my top 5 favorite albums of all time. Period. There is something truly magical about this album that you don\u2019t encounter often. Everything just fell into place perfectly.\n",
        "\nDream Theater in the '90s (and even in '89) was a much different band than the one that is often clowned today. Taking inspiration from bands like Rush (and yes, there is a TON of Rush in DT's sound), along with Queensr\u00ffche and Fates Warning, the quintet of musical virtuosos sought to write catchy, melodic metal with more complexity and technical ability than any other band in the world. On their sophomore album, they accomplished this, thanks in part to breakout singles like \"Another Day\" and \"Pull Me Under.\"\n\nThe best part of this album, to get this out of the way, is James LaBrie's legendary vocal performance. Songs like the aforementioned \"Pull Me Under\" and \"Another Day\" are simply brilliant, as is the Michael Jackson thing he does on \"Take the Time\" and the harmonic passages of \"Wait for Sleep.\" Every song, no matter how lengthy, is filled to the brim with emotional and beautiful singing, and although the music never gets too heavy, the contrast to metal riffing gives the album a very likable quality. Fueled by charismatic lyricism about life and hardship, James LaBrie delivers the best vocal performance of his career. It's truly a shame he blew his chords out a few years after, as his voice was never the same.\n\nNow, the instrumentation of this album is about as flawless as possible. From a technical standpoint, there isn't a band that touches Dream Theater when it comes to what they can do with their instruments. They are the Led Zeppelin of metal. To find five guys this talented, and whose styles work well enough to create catchy songs that don't drag on too long (we're still in '92 here) is something truly remarkable. Kevin Moore is the band's original keyboardist, although not as great as Jordan Rudess who later joined the band. The keyboards on this album aren't overwhelming, and while they do soften the sound quite a bit, they enhance the feel of the album and the pop metal act is pulled off perfectly. Make no mistake, though, this is the most intricate pop metal album humans could conceive of.\n\nIf you need examples, look to the back end of \"Metropolis Pt. 1,\" where the synthesizer solo and the nonstop rhythm changes are a brilliant ride through the band's brilliancy. Guitarist John Petrucci showcases his skills with catchy riffs and eye-popping solos all over this album. This album is his coming of age experience in real time, his songwriting and shredding ability is just off the charts on every song here. The drumming and bass playing are excellent, arguably the best in metal, but Petrucci is on another planet. The band makes sure not to overcomplicate things with the flashy stuff, though, and \"Under a Glass Moon\" has a calm but brooding intro. Moments like this, as well as the middle of the song with its gliding, silky hooks, are fun listens. The start-stop rhythm is a dash of unpredictability in many of the songs here as well, where the band thrives off their dense song structures. While the band would later become very self-indulgent, arguably to their own detriment, in 1992 they were at the apex of their game and produced the greatest progressive metal album of all time. This is truly a work of art.\n",
        "\nLost Not Forgotten Archives: The Majesty Demos (1985-1986) is the sixth release of Dream Theater's Lost Not Forgotten Archives that goes into its second year of existence. This collection of demos has been published for the first time nineteen years ago by Ytsejam Records. This release includes seventeen instrumentals songs and six tracks featuring guest vocals by Chris Collins.\n\nThe quality of the material has quite a few ups and downs. The earliest recorded tunes are heavily underproduced which makes them sound muffled yet very loud. Those elements make tracks such as short opener ''Particle E. Motion'' quite nerve-firing and tough to digest.\n\nThe band's instrumental talent however shows through in the longer instrumental tracks. ''Cry for Freedom'' is a highlight for avid collectors and fans with its adventurous, fast and melodic guitar play, surprisingly dominant, heavy and playful bass guitar patterns as well as vivid, ever-changing and diversified percussion and drum patterns. This song exemplifies three talented school friends playing for sheer pleasure best.\n\nThe record's shorter instrumental tunes are rather brief parodies of numerous other bands that were popular back in the mid-eighties from Yngwie Malmsteen over The Ramones to Stormtroopes of Death. Tunes like ''Mosquitos in Harmony Song'' might make you chuckle once but are overall extremely forgettable.\n\nThe record's final six tunes feature vocals by Chris Collins and keyboards by Kevin Moore. The former has an energetic, high-pitched and youthful voice reminding at times of Queensr\u00ffche's Geoff Tate. The only issues are that the singer tries a little bit too much to copy his idol instead of focusing on his own style and that his vocals end up sounding quite exchangeable, repetitive and unimaginative after a while. Kevin Moore's first performance with the band is more promising as he adds a few atmospheric layers that rate several songs up. However, his chemistry with the three core members is far from excellent and his instrument sounds at times too loud in the mixture. Despite such minor flaws, the final six songs show a very promising start to a career that would lead to the establishment of the world's most famous and successful progressive metal band. The technical talent is already exceptional while the songwriting still needs some focus but is already an improvement over the first instrumental recordings.\n\nAt the end of the day, Dream Theater's Lost Not Forgotten Archives: The Majesty Demos (1985-1986) is highly recommended to fans of the group's early years from the release dates of When Dream and Day Unite to A Change of Seasons. The band's first steps show much promise and excellent technical skills in the instrumental execution. Chris Collins' often forgotten guest vocals on the first demo are also decent enough and worth being discovered. Occasional fans might however complain about at times poor prodiction values and several lengths in the record's middle section. This compilation isn't among the archives' strongest outputs but can nevertheless be considered a hidden gem for avid collectors and faithful fans.\n",
        "\nDream Theater fans fall into two camps. You either think they are the greatest thing to ever happen to metal and that no other band could possibly fathom possessing even a fraction of their skill, or you think they are boring, dramatic, self-indulgent snobs who have never come out with anything engaging. Personally, I fall closer to the former, as Dream Theater is one of my favorite bands.\n\nOctavarium is DT's return to form after about six years of directionless material. The band sounds more focused, more creative, and more intent on writing good songs that aren't just canvases for the band to essentially jam and noodle over to show off how talented they are. Sometimes, they do that and it's annoying, but they mostly avoid such behavior on this album.\n\n\"The Root of All Evil\" gets right into a groove to launch this album off, with the legendary John Petrucci absolutely shredding away but also coming through with one of his better riffs that fits nicely alongside John Myung's bass work. But what's striking about this album is that it has less of the pure metal aspects and displays a more tender side of the band. \"The Answer Lies Within\" is a brilliant song driven by Jordan Rudess's keyboards and James LaBrie's best vocal performance since the early-'nineties. Even the guitar solo is smooth and glides nicely over the slow rhythm; the band sounds like they regained their grasp on not over-contemplating a song. Don't think the band lost their metal, though, it's just deployed more infrequently to create a softer sound to the album. \"These Walls\" brings back the strong power metal choruses that built Dream Theater's reputation, and Petrucci is just as much of a wizard as ever on the guitar.\n\nAdmittedly, this album does have its flaws. The songs are all very long, and even without the twenty-four minute epic that closes the album out, it would still top fifty minutes. This does lead to the band feeling like they're filling up space just to draw this album out. \"The Answer Lies Within\" is a great song but the ballad does run about forty-five seconds longer than it needs to. Similarly, \"These Walls\" could maybe have cut a verse out of the first half, although the narrative of the track is pretty pleasant. The symphonic harmonies are placed nicely for the most part, but they do sometimes soften the band's sound too much. After all this is a metal record, albeit Dream Theater. \n\nThe band really hits its stride on two songs: \"Panic Attack\" and the title track. \"Panic Attack\" is a pretty straightforward metal track with a driving riff and some killer drumming. The band crafts a dynamic, heavy progressive metal song here that doesn't rely on synthesizers or keyboards too much. James LaBrie sounds stellar on this song as well. The tracks that separate these two are solid but nothing that stands out as spectacular. The closing \"Octavarium\" is simply astounding, and truly a testament to how creative Dream Theater can be when they commit their genius to composing something epic in scale and performance. This album as a whole is definitely a comeback for the band, and a strong effort from all five members of the band both individually and collectively. The production is, of course, very clean but it doesn't take away from the listening experience because it isn't saturated. The band finds a good balance between making the instruments heard but not overbearing, and LaBrie sings his heart out with one of the best full-length performances of his career (\"Sacrificed Sons\" for example!).\n",
        "\nRight off the bat, I have to confess that my last tryst with the band has been The Astonishing and I have yet to listen to Distance Over Time (which I was told is a return to form of some sorts). The Astonishing was amazingly bland for the most part and I can\u2019t for the life of me remember even a single song off the album, which should tell you enough. Tasteless boring ballads galore along with a few moments of genuine musicality, really. \n\nOn the whole, since their stellar Black Clouds and Silver Linings release more than a decade back, I have to confess that not a single album of the band has done it for me in any way. Be it the terribly mediocre lyrics or singing as well as the mindless and aimless technicality of the band that has little to no impact on any listener with a basic understanding of music, I really can\u2019t say things have looked bright for the band in the entire 2nd decade of the 21st century. With that out of the way, lets tackle the first 2 singles off the new album.\n\nHere, the intro part of \u201cThe Alien\u201d with the heavy riffs and keys reminded me of Systematic Chaos and Train Of Thought\u2019s heavier moments which surprisingly work rather well for the sound of the band, as long as LaBrie\u2019s yapping vocals are kept away. Yeah, harsh but true. The blend between the heavy and light elements of the song maintains a good balance till the 5th minute when the rest of the band take a backseat as Petrucci goes into full solo-whipping mode. After the chorus, the songs goes into heavy territory ending on quite the high note. All in all, pretty good plus Petrucci\u2019s guitars have this soaring quality and edge that was sorely lacking in the previous releases. I was quite taken aback by the opening riffs of \u201cAwaken The Master\u201d since that down-tuned edge is more akin to djent than old-school prog metal. However, the song morphs into quite the epic ride with some mean guitar chugging with the keys and the vocals carving a marvellous picture in the background. Definitely one of the more underrated picks in DT\u2019s song catalogue that has all the signs of becoming a classic in the future with some killer technical guitar work by the one and only Petrucci.\n\n\u201cInvisible Monsters\u201d is where you realize that the overall sound and mix for this album is just perfect with every instrument getting its due including the (gasp!) bass. Yup, get yourself a kickass pair of headphones and revel in the awesome mix of this album. With cleaning picking and groovy chugs setting the tone for the song, a catchy chorus is the perfect icing on the cake along with some pretty meaty guitar licks to back it all up. The interlude at 3:30 followed by a rapid build-up also works rather well. This song has a subtle Power metal influence which works pretty damn well making it the ideal pick for the 1st single of the album. \u201cTranscending Time\u201d is one of the few DT ballads with heavy riffs to back it up along with a face-melting solo, making for quite the nice change in pace. Even the piano fade-out at the end is a great touch.\n\nThe epic title track along with \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d makes you realize that the band has finally let Rudess breath a bit more on the keys and come up with more soulful and memorable parts instead of just shredding or being a backbone for the rhythm guitar. Honestly, Rudess works a lot better when he adds to the musical picture instead of being allowed to shred mindlessly all over the place (that\u2019s the guitars job) and this album proves that fact in spades. \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d is one song where the vocals really shine and Labrie actually sounds earnest and full of energy and feel rather than other albums where the vocals sound more phoned-in and tepid rather than having an energy of their own. The title track is a goddamn epic, right up their with \u201cTrial Of Tears\u201d, \u201cScarred\u201d and \u201cThe Count Of Tuscany\u201d as one of their best long songs ever. Yup, I said it. The clean-picking part around the 9th minute is simply gorgeously crafted making it even more sublime with the subtle keys in the background. After a blistering instrumental workout, the soulful last 3 minutes of the song along with Labrie\u2019s vocal have to be heard to be believed. Pretty much everything I dig about prog music nicely wrapped into a 20 minute package. \n\nOne of the main reasons this album works so well is the fact that all the songs have fast and slow parts weaving perfectly with one another, creating some amazing and very naturally flowing soundscapes, plus most importantly, the band knows when to stop and just let the music breath and have it\u2019s own feel rather than all the instruments trying to outrun one another in one giant wank session. That\u2019s kept to an absolute minimum here, making the metal parts heavier and I honestly wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \u201cAnswering the Call\u201d has one of the best intros of any DT song with a salvo of hard-hitting melodic riffs followed by some really heartfelt vocals by Labrie making me wonder what the band could have become instead, had they followed this path in the 2nd decade of the 21st Century. Well, better late than never, I\u2019d say.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m glad to see that DT hasn\u2019t forgotten the METAL part of Prog Metal. For a band who never really put much emphasis on the songwriting aspect of the music, I have to confess that this album was quite the pleasant surprise for me, considering I haven\u2019t enjoyed an entire album from them in ages (12 years to be exact). Overlong songs with little to no substance and overstretched flab was always one of the main problems this band faced ever since Falling Into Infinity and I am thoroughly pleased to see that aspect has been remedied to a considerable degree. Good job guys, damn good job considering that more than half the songs on the album cross the 10 minute mark and enough guitar licks and keyboard parts do sound like the perfect throwback to their classic Awake/Image and Words sound. I have absolutely no doubts in saying that this album will certainly top most Prog metal AOTY charts and on that note, I\u2019m definitely giving Distance Over Time a couple of spins now.\n",
        "\nFinally, a Dream Theater album where most of the overwhelming amount of praise directed towards it is well deserved! Yes, being a casual fan of the band, I\u2019m sure a lot of you would be surprised to hear this, but it\u2019s true. I mean at first glance, who would think that six songs stretching over an hour long would end up being a good album? But hey, being Dream Theater, the guys just love their long songs, which is really not that big of a problem as long as they keep the wanking around to a minimum without forcing the songwriting process. Both these two drawbacks have been completely reigned in here and the stunning results are plain and clear for all of us to see. The soothing ballad \u201cWither\u201d with the melancholic intro reminds me of a more concise and soaring version of \u201cThe Ministry Of Lost Souls\u201d from their previous album Systematic Chaos. \n\nSurprisingly we get a bit of a middle-eastern influence in the intro of \u201cThe Shattered Fortress\u201d leading to a tasty metal fest of heavy riffs and a keyboard/guitar shred fest. Honestly, this song is everything that \u201cThe Dark Eternal Night\u201d tried to be but failed badly. The second half of the song goes into clean picking mode with LaBrie pulling off some of his best and most heartfelt vocal lines. One of the very few songs where DT have been at their heaviest and actually succeeded in pulling it off well. (Train Of Thought anyone??) Additionally, I\u2019ve leave you to figure out which riffs of their previous songs they\u2019ve tastefully incorporated into this epic, especially the ending riff! Trust me, it\u2019s actually quite fun to figure it out.\n\n\u201cA Nightmare To Remember\u201d is one heck of an opening track with heavy chugs leading to a beautiful clean-picked mid section that is quite memorable. This song along with \u201cA Rite Of Passage\u201d (a super-catchy chorus with a blistering solo) makes good use of rapping/heavy vocals that make the heavy parts sound heavier than otherwise, along with some mean groove/thrash riffs pushing the pedal all the way up to 11. Hard to believe that the same type of vocals sounded awkwardly out of place and ill-fitting in Train Of Thought and Six Degrees\u2026 but here, it works pretty damn well and how! \u201cThe Count Of Tuscany\u201d is a goddamn clinic in tasteful guitarwork and melodic mastery all through the way along with Labrie weaving some intricate vocal patterns over the furious guitar/keyboard interplay making for quite the rollercoaster ride. With peaks and valleys aplenty stretching to a silky gorgeous lead guitar break after the 10th minute to close with a lovely acoustic strumming section, this closer is everything that is good about both DT and prog metal as a whole. Superb, just superb.\n\nAlthough quite a few people haven\u2019t touched upon this aspect much, I\u2019ll say it anyway: Labrie just proved here that he sounds a heck of a lot better when he sticks to his high mid-range vocals while avoiding any high-pitched vocal parts. That was an irritating aspect of their previous albums that has thankfully been done away with here. He\u2019s right in his comfort zone here and it definitely shows along with some amazing dual vocal harmonies with Portnoy. Yeah, he\u2019s not one of the best vocalists in prog metal, (atleast not anymore) but hey, he gets the job done pretty well being comfortable in his skin, so that\u2019s that. And for all those of you still complaining about DT not showing any emotion or feel in their music, a cursory listen of the soulful \u201cThe Best Of Times\u201d should be enough to change your mind. It has a lovely epic, happy feel reminiscent of \u201cSurrounded\u201d from their classic Images and Words finishing with one of the most climactic endings to a song,\n\nThis album clearly shows even their worst detractors and critics (that includes me at times btw) that when the prog stalwarts actually get their knuckles cracking and put their minds to it, they can make some killer music that is actually memorable and fun to listen to. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, I\u2019m still digging the album more than a decade after its release! Great job guys.\n",
        "\nLost Not Forgotten Archives: When Dream and Day Reunite (Live) is the fifth release of Dream Theater's Lost Not Forgotten Archives. It was previously released by YtseJam Records in 2005. The album contains the second set of a show in Los Angeles in 2004 where the band performed its entire debut album When Dream and Day Unite to celebrate its fifteenth anniversary. The most interesting element about this release is the encore, featuring former singer Charlie Dominici on two songs and former keyboarder Derek Sherinian on one of the two songs.\n\nThe band was in excellent shape when playing this show as this release is even more exciting than the already very good debut album. James LaBrie's variable, skilled and recognizable vocals push the material onto a higher level. Jordan Rudess' skills on the keyboard make the material sound more dynamic, playful and progressive. The other members are simply true to themselves. John Myung is the solid backbone of the band with his precise and collaborative style on the bass guitar. John Petrucci delivers heavy riffs and beautiful solos with incredible diversity, flexibility and fluidity. Mike Portnoy's drum play is adventurous, dominant and powerful at all times. The invited musicians also do excellent jobs. Charles Dominici might not be as talented as James LaBrie but he manages to hit some high notes surprisingly well and compensates his minor technical flaws with addictive passion as he is clearly enjoying the spotlight. Derek Sherinian's performance isn't as versatile as Jordan Rudess' keyboard chops but his more atmospheric style adds a lot of depth to the song he is playing on that never gets boring despite a challenging running time of more than fourteen minutes.\n\nThe two encores are true gems for any fan of the band. ''To Live Forever'' is an obscure track from the early years that has only very rarely been played but its melodious quality would make other progressive metal bands go green with envy as this hidden masterpiece deserves more attention. The adventurous, improvised and playful version of ''Metropolis Part 1: (The Miracle and the Sleeper)'' is one of many intriguing versions of what might be the band's very best song and this rendition here convinces with its extended atmospheric instrumental section that justifies multiple spins to discover its numerous details over and over again.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's great that Dream Theater's Lost Not Forgotten Archives: When Dream and Day Reunite (Live) sees the light of day in a revamped version sixteen years after its original release and seventeen years after its recording. This live album doesn't only feature the under-appreciated debut album in its entirety but also convinces with improved musicianship and vocals and two stunning bonus tracks, including one eternal classic and one overlooked hidden gem, featuring two guest musicians connected to Dream Theater's illustrious past. Any fan of the band should pick this release up and even newcomers might start their discovery here with the debut album in its best possible form.\n",
        "\nBack in the early years of the millennium, progressive metal veterans Dream Theater honoured several of their favourite bands by playing their records from start to finish. These renditions include Deep Purple's Made in Japan, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast. Lost Not Forgotten Archives: Master of Puppets - Live in Barcelona, 2002 obviously features the band's homage to the legendary thrash metal quartet that might be the most commercially successful genre band ever.\n\nIt might be debatable whether one prefers Metallica's gritty originals or Dream Theater's more playful renditions of the material. Nobody can however deny that the eight songs played here are executed with technically stunning musicianship. The drum play by Mike Portnoy is dynamic, playful and tight all at once and easily outperforms Lars Ulrich's efficient but simpler style. John Myung is able to replicate Cliff Burton's style easily which is remarkable on its own but sadly fails to add his own note to the original material. John Petrucci on the other side has to vary constantly between gritty riffs and melodic soloing and accomplishes these transitions with remarkable ease that underlines the fact that he is one of the greatest guitarists in the world. James LaBrie's vocals sound surprisingly gritty as he is clearly enjoying himself while performing this unusual material. His vocals might not be as unique as James Hetfield's original performances but the vocals are nevertheless the most positive surprise on this release. Perhaps he should focus on thrash metal on his next solo album. Jordan Rudess has the difficult job to add keyboard sounds to support John Petrucci on guitar while the original material didn't have any of that. While the keyboards add new touches here and there, they are simply stated rarely employed and overall rather unnecessary. The production is raw which benefits the grittier sounds but it's slightly irritating during announcements and crowd recordings.\n\nAt the end of the day, some elements here sound better than in the original versions such as the dynamic drum play and outstanding guitar work. The vocals are on the same high level which comes as this release's most positive surprise. The bass guitar play and the keyboards could however sound slightly more adventurous. The final result is certainly worth the attention of both Dream Theater and Metallica fans. I'm a fan of both bands and didn't expect to like this bootleg as much as I do. It has a lot of replay value and it's very interesting to compare it to the original material. Check this release out on Spotify and buy the record if you end up liking it as much as I do.\n",
        "\nI never find it easy to review Dream Theater. Everyone knows what they sound like already and all the obvious things to say are givens. This is heavy prog, performed by people with insane technical ability. The songs are generally long, the seven on offer here ranging from six and a half minutes to a breath over twenty, and they're intricate and mesmerising, which means that albums are really long as well, always over an hour and often seventy minutes and beyond. And I can hear you all say, \"Well, duh!\" This is the audio porn of choice for many metal musicians, regardless of what instrument they play.\n\nWhat a Dream Theater review usually comes down to for me is a personal call as to whether I liked it or not. This one I did a lot. The last one, Distance Over Time, not so much, though it did mix it up a lot more than usual, going for, as the title suggested, ground covered rather than how long that process took. It lasted under an hour and the songs were generally short, none of them reaching ten minutes, without any extended breaks for the musicians to showcase their abilities. It didn't work particularly well for me and I wonder if I was overly generous with my 6/10 rating. Given that this album is back to business as usual, maybe it didn't work particularly well for the band either.\n\nAnd I certainly appreciated this return to long and intricate songs with long and intricate passages of instrumental virtuosity. What's telling for me this time out is that, while the various musicians enjoy indulging themselves, the songs manage to retain some catchiness and that's crucial for this band. It has to be said that Pull Me Under succeeded so well because it did all the instrumental acrobatics the band are known for while being fundamentally catchy to a mainstream audience. That's a neat trick if you can manage it and even Dream Theater struggled to manage it again. This album is a reasonable effort on that front throughout and it's all the better for it.\n\nThe closest to a Pull Me Under here is Invisible Monster, not quite the shortest track at six and a half minutes exactly but only Transcending Time is shorter and even then only by six seconds. The chorus is obviously a chorus and its hook is pretty good. Even better is the keyboard section early in the second half that leads into a guitar solo. Sleeping Giant and Awaken the Master are closer to the ten minute mark but they're both as catchy as they are adventurous and indulgent, the former finding a Zeppelin riff and a Purple vibe for the first couple of minutes, neither of which I really was expecting from this band. All these songs feel good but they also feel right, even with their instrumental parts. Nothing feels too long, not even the twenty minute title track, which is an epic indeed.\n\nTranscending Time feels playful and vibrant, as if the musicians had built a framework together for it but jammed through it anyway, to keep the feel fresh. These logical contradictions apply throughout. Awaken the Master feels particularly aggressive, with some driving drums early on, but thoughtful as well, especially with its keyboards. It's as close as I've heard Dream Theater approach a Liquid Tension Experiment showcase in a long time, but it's equally effective in its slower sections. There's also some of that in the opener, The Alien, which doesn't sustain it as well but is a highlight nonetheless.\n\nI began my review of Distance Over Time by stating that \"I've never been the world's biggest Dream Theater fan\", even though I have massive respect for their talents and achievements. Nothing on that 2019 album changed that opinion because it mostly left me dry. This one, on the other hand, may well convert me. It's exactly the sort of thing I want from a band like this and I enjoyed it immensely, more so than I can remember doing before. Never mind how great each individual musician is; that can be taken for granted with Dream Theater. This is a fun album, one to enjoy immediately and one to dive into with abandon to explore what they're actually doing. I like that.\n\nReview originally posted at Apocalypse Later Music at https://www.apocalypselatermusic.com/2021/10/dream-theater-view-from-top-of-world.html.\n",
        "\nIn the wake of an historic change, following the release of A Dramatic Turn of Events, fans were mostly hopeful that the Dream Theater they knew was still alive and moving into new territory. However, their subsequent two releases only proved troublesome for many fans. Their self-titled 2013 release only showed that the new lineup had limited chemistry for writing, and The Astonishing will probably (regrettably or not) go down as one of the prime examples of what a terrible mistake made by great musicians can sound like. Thankfully, 2019\u2019s Distance Over Time saw the reset of a band that had journeyed into an area of creative ambiguity that resided between stagnation and pure absurdity. For the most part, this album was not their best, but I think the fans were just thankful to see the band back on track. It was written as a reaction to their 2016 album, so it was rather safe, but it proved to be enough. They were out of the muck and mire that held them down for almost 10 years. \n\nNow in 2021, A View from The Top of The World is the new place marker for what a great Dream Theater album should be. Although this album can\u2019t be placed among the greats like Images and Words or Scenes from A Memory, it effectively displays the writing brilliance of Dream Theater once again. It has those traditional radio-friendly songs like \u201cInvisible Monster,\u201d and \u201cTranscending the Time,\u201d then the heavier, less radio friendly but palatable songs such as \u201cThe Alien,\u201d and \u201cAnswering the Call,\u201d and of course the mini-epics \u201cSleeping Giant,\u201d and \u201cAwaken the Master.\u201d All of these songs work well to complement each other and keep the momentum of the album up all the way to the new epic, A View From the Top of the World. Overall, the album is well-balanced, has some of the member\u2019s best performances in years (including James), and has what is arguably the best sounding production of any Dream Theater album to date. \n\nThe thing that keeps me coming back to this album is that it is not too weighted on one side. We get a well-balanced set of songs that go from dark and complex like \u201cThe Alien,\u201d to the more pop-driven, Rush-esque song \u201cTranscending Time,\u201d and the progressively dark \u201cAwaken the Master.\u201d Also, with the first mini epic \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d taking place right in the middle, the band keeps the listener interested due to its progressive interludes. Also, it sounds like the band just had fun on that song. \n\nJohn Petrucci is proving competent in his riff writing all through the album. Although most of the riffs favour the heavier single-string/lower-string grooves that have become synonymous with the band since 2009\u2019s Black Clouds and Silver Linings, they work well to introduce and drive each song forward. I was especially pleased with both the heavy 8-string riff that opened \u201cAwaken the Master\u201d, and the riff that opened \u201cSleeping Giant.\u201d This latter riff may be simple, but it fits quite well into the song due to the reoccurring themes that compliment it. \n\nThe only song I had any real struggle appreciating was the title track. The reasons are few (only one) but, simply put, the song should not have been as long as it was. It felt to me that everything after the 18-minute mark was DT doing their typical \u201cepic ending\u201d parts. It got the job done, but it made a decent song a little too bloated for its own good. It is similar to how \u201cAstonishing\u201d ended their 2016 album. It seemed to serve only the purpose of having that \u201cepic ending\u201d that clearly only served to just meet that requirement and nothing more. It gets old after a while.\n\nThe best part about this album is easily the performances. The weight of covid and tour delays must have added to the desire to be able to put their all into a new album. I am truly in awe that, even though most of the members are pushing 60, the level of talent and virtuosity that goes into every song is not compromised. Every member works well together to serve the purpose of the music. John Myung and John Petrucci are locked in perfect synchronicity throughout the album, John\u2019s solos are tasteful yet prominent on every track, Jordan\u2019s choice of keyboard parts shift from supporting role to center-stage when needed, and Mike\u2019s playing is the best it has been since he joined the band. The way he matches the rhythmic patterns of every song goes to show how well he works to support the band. He also knows when to hold it back and when to show off. Like many fans, I was amazed by his performance on \u201cThe Alien,\u201d but I am also just as amazed at how much he holds back on the second section of the title track, \u201cRapture of the Deep.\u201d It goes to show the musical maturity that he has. Finally, the performance of James is easily the best in years. The years have not been kind to him, but this album shows that he is working well with what he has. What makes his performance so great is his choice of melody. The choruses are the best example of this. Specifically, the choruses of \u201cSleeping Giant,\u201d \u201cAwaken the Master,\u201d and the title track. I also appreciated the phrasing that he went with on a lot of the songs. The best examples would be the verse of \u201cAwaken the Master,\u201d and the vocals in \u201cRapture of the Deep.\u201d In my opinion, this is new territory for this band. \n\nFinally, the production of the album is perfect. It is clearly a very polished sound, but it does not give itself to over production like their self-titled album suffered from. I think everyone can agree on one thing about this album: they need to keep Andy Sneap around. The drums finally sound great. They are loud enough to punch through the mix just enough. We can hear John Myung\u2019s bass parts. John Petrucci\u2019s choice of minimal multi-tracks allows for this. Jordan\u2019s parts fit well in the music, but this has never really been a problem on any DT album. And James, not only gives his best performance since (arguably) Octavarium, he has no auto tune or other dubious \u201cfixes\u201d on his voice that we have heard on the last three albums. \n\nThis album is the most promising outing of a band that has more than made their mark on metal. They are one of few bands that were the progenitors of this genre, and they are not about to slow down. They defined the genre in 1992, and they continue to push the boundaries even after almost 40 years and over 18 hours of music. \n\nHighlights:\nSleeping Giant\nAwaken the Master\nA View From the Top of the World\n",
        "\nThe third release in Dream Theater's new archives series is Lost Not Forgotten Archives: Train of Thought - Instrumental Demos (2003). Initially released twelve years ago, this record is only interesting for the most adamant collectors, faithful fans and musicians who appreciate Dream Theater for their instrumental skills but have issues with James LaBrie's vocals. From the latter perspective, Mike Portnoy fan boys might consider this record a dream come true.\n\nHowever, James LaBrie's melodic vocals breathe life into the band's technically appealing musicianship. Without him, many performances sound like a mixture of jam sessions and endless instrumental wankery. This is why things are quickly getting boring here. The opening ''In the Name of God'' might be almost two minutes shorter than the official version but it feels much longer due to the lack of diversity, emotions and power brought by the vocals. The focused, poignant and sinister single ''As I Am'' also works only half as well without its charismatic chorus.\n\nThere are a few positive exceptions when the demo versions sound as great as the regular songs. The shorter rendition of ballad ''Vacant'' sounds refreshing as it clocks in just under three minutes and should have been kept as concise for the final version in my opinion. Instrumental tune ''Stream of Consciousness'' is slightly longer than the official version but ends on some dynamic studio banter.\n\nAt the end of the day, Dream Theater's Lost Not Forgotten Archives: Train of Thought - Instrumental Demos (2003) is only interesting for a limited number of fans. This might be a welcome release if you are either a musician eager to learn how to play these songs or if you don't like vocalist James LaBrie. Occasional and even regular fans can skip these demos without any regrets and focus on the other more interesting archives releases so far such as the energetic live rendition Lost Not Forgotten Archives: Master of Puppets - Live in Barcelona, 2002.\n",
        "\nComing hot off the heels of their return to form in the eyes of the public with Scenes from a Memory, Dream Theater had the hard task of giving it a proper follow up. SFAM was important in the band's history not only for being the first one recorded with their now long established keyboardist Jordan Rudess, but for also being up until that point their most ambitious (and alas, progressive) record. Thankfully, Dream Theater was anything but creatively dry during this period, and in 2002 released the experimental and, in my honest opinion, best album of their entire career, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\n\nThe album was at the time their first double album, up until The Astonishing. It was also their longest album at the time, up until (again) The Astonishing, clocking at almost an hour and a half. While other bands struggle to make even 40 minute albums appealing, Dream Theater doesn't disappoint in this front, ensuring every minute of the colossal runtime doesn't go to waste.\n\nThe album opens up with The Glass Prison, one of the heaviest songs the band has ever penned. and this song can be viewed as a snapshot of what the album offers; blazingly fast and intricate guitar riffs, a stomping drum section with tasteful fills and keyboards that serve both atmosphere and hold-release dynamics, that gives us the Petrucci-Rudess unison solos that are characteristic of the band. Myung's bass provides a strong backbone without much fanfare. And finally James LaBrie's vocals.\n\nLaBrie's vocals are probably the most controversial aspect of Dream Theater. Truth to be told, even in his peak during the Images and Words and Awake days his voice were NO SE as whiny and too glam-like (which makes sense considering he was in a glam metal band before joining DT). But here they serve the music perfectly, both in the aggressive and mellow parts. His performance on the tearjerker ballad Disappear is astonishingly beautiful. Mostly a piano and acoustic piece. Another overlooked feature of LaBrie's are his lyrics, resulting in some of the most emotional and personal songs of DT's catalogue. Blind Faith is a perfect example of that, along with the aforementioned Disappear, of his strong pen work, with the song detailing about a man who asks himself questions about the meaning of life and the religion and at last he found answers;\n\n\"Sorry you must excuse me\nI've painted my own Mona Lisa\nShe's fixed everything\nNow I'm spoiled beyond my wildest dreams\"\n\n\"I hope that you hear me\nToo proud to be around\nThere's more to us than we see now\"\n\nAnd finally we get to the behemoth of the title track, which occupies the second disc of the album. An overly complex suite detailing the issues of mental health from the perspective of six different characters, each with their own backgrounds and ways of life. The piece is based on the overture that kicks the suite, written by Rudess and then expanded to reach almost 42 minutes of duration with enough twist and turns to not feel meandering or boring in that timeframe. It can go from uplifting (About To Crash) to furious (War Inside My Head), to melancholic (Goodnight Kiss), without ever jumping the shark.\n\nOverall, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence was the peak of Dream Theater as band for me. While I continue to love and enjoy almost everything they made following this up, there's no denying this album finds every facet of the band and puts them to good use, resulting in the prog metal's titans most ambitious and rewarding listening experience.\n",
        "\nDream Theater have been one of my favourite bands for quite a while now, after I started listening to them in high school. I first stumbled upon them, when a friend played me \u2018Take the Time\u2019, and even though I didn\u2019t immediately become a fan, I found their style interesting, for sure. Back in the time when you illegally downloaded songs one by one (but, in my defense, I have always been an advocate of buying CDs, even then), I was later intrigued by \u2018Pull Me Under\u2019 and \u2018As I Am\u2019. So, when I finally stumbled upon \u2018Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\u2019 at a local CD store, I knew it was time to check out a full DT album \u2013 and boy, did a world open up for me! But this should become a review for \u2018Black Clouds and Silver Linings\u2019, the only DT album I bought right when it was released, so let me turn that corner to ending this long introduction. My expectations were quite high, back then in 2009, but the album never really clicked with me. Now, after a rather long phase of not listening to DT extensively, I finally got in the mood again and now my opinion seems more clearly defined. \n\n\u2018Black Clouds and Silver Linings\u2019 starts off epically with \u2018A Nightmare to Remember\u2019. The dark atmosphere of this song\u2019s intro has always captured me, with Jordan Rudess\u2019 choir keyboard sounds almost resembling a Dimmu Borgir epicness (but, no offense Dimmu, with more sophisticated music around that.) Over its more than 16 minutes, \u2018Nightmare\u2019 evolves interestingly, from the driving verse riff (with a really cool solo) to a rather held-back chorusish passage (hard to speak of traditional song structures in a song like that), which gathers momentum when it returns later in different shape around the 4:27 mark. Without going in too much detail about the rest of the song, the middle section proves DT\u2019s capability of creating score-like atmospheres, dragging listeners into the story they want to tell. In my opinion, this whole storytelling venture oftentimes stands and falls with the lyrics, but more to that later. Here it went exceptionally well, and from the middle the song slowly builds up again to climax before returning to the intro, an easy but extremely effective trick to round off the song. Even though ANTR is a fabulous song, there are few issues here, one that I do have is Mike Portnoy\u2019s drumming in a few parts, most remarkably towards the end, when he plays a blast beat over a part where it does not do anything for the song. It seems to me like he merely wants to make a point of how tough DT can actually be (a criticism that can be made about more songs on more albums by them, and to me it appears like Portnoy plays a huge role in that we-are-so-hard charade.)\n\nTracks 2 and 3, \u2018A Rite of Passage\u2019 and \u2018Whither\u2019 are solid, but not spectacular. While the former proves a very playful song, the overall impression is that of a rather simple song. One could argue that it needs a lot of skill to write a progressive song that doesn\u2019t feel like one, but in my opinion, there are better examples of that in DT\u2019s discrography, like \u2018Forsaken\u2019 on \u2018Systematic Chaos\u2019. Nevertheless, even though the effects on James LaBrie\u2019s voice in the verse are kind of a pain in the ass, the song rocks and is interesting to listen to. \u2018Whither\u2019 turns out even simpler, but hey, it\u2019s a ballad. Also not DT\u2019s best, but a good, solid one. James\u2019 warm, soulful vocal performance (if you like his voice) really helps the song to evolve and unfold. Yet again, there are better examples of such mellow, soothing (and more complex) songs, like \u2018Disappear\u2019 (on \u2018Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u2019) or \u2018The Ministry of Lost Souls\u2019 (once again from \u2018Systematic Chaos\u2019.)\n\nAs for more complex, that\u2019s what\u2019s expecting listeners after \u2018Whither\u2019 in the second half (in track numbers, not playing time!) of the album. \u2018The Shattered Fortress\u2019 is the, at least from my point of view, long-expected finale to the AA-suite. After the impressive \u2018Glass Prison\u2019, the very heavy but slightly boring \u2018This Dying Soul\u2019, the less heavy and less boring headbanger \u2018The Root of All Evil\u2019 and the surprisingly mellow (and brilliant) \u2018Repentance\u2019, I was extremely curious about how DT would round the whole thing off. With a little distance now, I\u2019m not as surprised as I was back then on how it went down: good but a but stale. \u2018The Shattered Fortress\u2019 does convince with tying together loose ends from all parts, without however adding anything noteworthily new. But then again, if I go through the whole suite from beginning to end, most songs didn\u2019t do that either. \u2018Glass Prison\u2019 is the only one that really sticks out for me, while \u2018The Root of All Evil\u2019 and \u2018Repentance\u2019 mainly repeat the same main riff that \u2018This Dying Soul\u2019 is based on, just in very different moods. (I\u2019m still a huge fan of \u2018Repentance\u2019 though, can\u2019t help myself.)\n\nAfter this almost 13 minutes journey through Portnoy\u2019s coming to terms with his alcohol addiction, follows another song dominated by him as a person. In \u2018The Best of Times\u2019, he processes the death of his father. The song starts off softly with a piano line supported by a delicate string melody and acoustic guitar, yet soon gathers momentum and a more upbeat mood with a super-fast guitar line, followed by a rather bland verse and chorus. \u2018Bland\u2019, in general, kind of sums up the song for me. Even though the song does not lack variety, most parts in themselves are not very good, if I\u2019m honest, which pains me to say, considering how much the song probably means to Portnoy.\n\nSince I mentioned lyrics before, an issue that is being commented on in more than one review of DT albums here, I want to say that I really appreciate the band\u2019s variety of oftentimes day-to-day-life topics they address. It\u2019s a refreshing change to hear someone singing about relatable inner struggles (\u2018Whither\u2019), the loss of loved ones (\u2018The Best of Times\u2019), or, well, a car accident (\u2018A Nightmare to Remember\u2019.) I would argue that, in a metal environment, writing and performing such lyrics actually requires more courage than singing about, let\u2019s say, havoc-wreaking Vikings, a maniac psycho-killer, or the World Wars. Especially, opening up one\u2019s heart like Portnoy does in the AA-suite or the afore mentioned \u2018The Best of Times\u2019, is something I cannot but deeply respect (even if the AA philosophy is one that cannot be criticized enough, in my opinion, and some lyrics are definitely not well executed.) DT\u2019s music, with its playfulness and variety of moods, just provides the perfect surrounding for such issues to be addressed. But in order for that to work, music and lyrics need to go hand in hand AND the lyrics must be written well. And unfortunately, there are quite some examples in DT\u2019s discography where this is definitely not the case. One of the most prominent examples for this, in my opinion, is the last song on \u2018Black Clouds\u2026\u2019, \u2018The Count of Tuscany\u2019. While the music is downright brilliant (playful, never boring, atmospheric, catchy but demanding), the lyrics are really badly executed. I need to state that the basic idea is highly interesting, evolving around the protagonist basically being lost in translation and totally misinterpreting the behavior of another person from a different culture. Yet, even if, according to Wikipedia, the lyrics are based on an actual encounter which John Petrucci had, as I listener I can\u2019t help but find them, well, stupid. If I needed to sum it up, it would go like \u2018Petrucci meets a rich dude in Italy, gets afraid of his brother who might be a cannibal, but in the end it\u2019s all good because nobody tried to eat Petrucci.\u2019 Sorry, but I can\u2019t help to find that laughable, even if I can imagine being in such a situation might be creepy as hell. But, please, worthy lyrics would really help to transport that atmosphere believably. And, wait, I mentioned interaction between lyrics and music before \u2013 the part where Portnoy (?) with his oh-so-hard backing growls sings \u201cLet me introduce! My brother! A bearded gentleman! Historian!\u201d is\u2026 it\u2019s hard to put into words how bad I think it is. And that almost makes me angry, because the music, as I\u2019ve already said, is just great, DT at their best!\n\nTo finally sum up my review, \u2018Black Clouds and Silver Linings\u2019 has extremely much to offer, even if some songs or parts of them, if you compare them to other Material from DT, are not as good as they could be. While \u2018A Nightmare to Remember\u2019 and \u2018The Count of Tuscany\u2019 (bar the lyrics) are DT at the top of their game, \u2018The Shattered Fortress\u2019 is not as convincing as it could (should) have been. And with the two good but not brilliant songs (\u2018A Rite of Passage\u2019 and \u2018Whither\u2019) and one uninteresting one (\u2018The Best of Times\u2019), I cannot help but feel that this album had the potential to be one of their best but in the end failed, for reasons mentioned above.\n",
        "\nThroughout the pandemic, progressive metal veterans Dream Theater have been more active than ever before as they have released a massive official live record with Distant Memories - Live in London, a Christmas single named ''The Holiday Spirit Carries On'' in support of their tour crew and the first four records of their Lost Not Forgotten Archives, including three bootleg live records and one demo. The band's fifteenth studio album was prepared with the help of video conferences as James Labrie was stuck in Canada while the other four members could meet in the United States of America. Once the band members could finally reunite, they recorded A View from the Top of the World at their brand-new own studio which shows that the band is alive and kicking and still has many projects for the near future. Even though the group had to push back its tour in support of the album from fall to spring due to the pandemic, the band still decided to release the new record now. Few bands have been as consistent in their development and release strategy as the dynamic quintet and this deserves to be pointed out as an inspiring example that should be followed by their colleagues in difficult times.\n\nAs for the record itself, it qualifies as a good average Dream Theater album in the key of the even stronger predecessor Distance over Time. Make no mistake however, since a good average Dream Theater album still easily outclasses the vast majority of the material released by less experienced, gifted and inspired genre colleagues.\n\nSeveral similarities can be found between the predecessor and this new output. The band continues to find the right balance between energetic, fast and technical progressive metal soundscapes and catchy, melodic and soothing progressive rock harmonies. The songwriting remains diverse as every band member was involved in the musicianship while three band members provided lyrics to the seven songs. There is even a direct connection between the two records as the predecessor ended with ''Pale Blue Dot'' asking philosophical questions about life on our planet while the opening ''The Alien'' on this output explores mankind leaving said planet behind and establishing a society on another planet.\n\nA few differences can also be pointed out between the two records. The production might be the best Dream Theater has ever had as every instrument sounds crystal clear and the different soundscapes harmonize and complement one another perfectly. This record is overall heavier which becomes obvious in the aggressive, fast and powerful opener ''The Alien'' or the modern, sinister and technical ''Awaken the Master''. The drum play is particularly adventurous as can be witnessed in the dynamic, energetic and variable ''Sleeping Giant'' and creative, diversified and emotional album closer and title track ''A View from the Top of the World''. Another noteworthy element are the experimental soundscapes provided by keyboardist Jordan Rudess who manages to incorporate organic-sounding orchestral samples that add an elegant classical atmosphere to songs such as ''A View from the Top of the World''.\n\nIf compared to the predecessor, the material on A View from the Top of the World might need a few more spins to grow but offers much replay value for patient listeners. The melodic, smooth and thoughtful ''Invisible Monster'' with its inspiring lyrics or the harmonious, timeless and uplifting power ballad ''Transcending Time'' are perfect examples for songs that unfold their magic after multiple spins. Overall however, the songwriting is less fluid, the melodies less infectious and the choruses less catchy here than on the excellent predecessor.\n\nAt the end of the day, occasional and faithful Dream Theater fans can't go wrong with purchasing the band's fifteenth studio album A View from the Top of the World that shows a band living the dream despite difficult circumstances. If you have never or only rarely come across Dream Theater, you would however rather want to start your discovery with the band's classic progressive metal masterpieces that have stood the test of time such as Images and Words, a more recent output showcasing the full potential of the current line-up such as the fresh A Dramatic Turn of Events or one of the band's massive live record such as the entertaining Distant Memories - Live in London.\n",
        "\nThe 2010s were a strange and frustrating time to be a Dream Theater fan. Despite the refreshing promise that came with 2011\u2019s A Dramatic Turn of Events, the band seemed to plateau with efforts like 2014\u2019s self-titled album and 2019\u2019s Distance Over Time. It sometimes feels like their creativity has been cursed, forever barred from reaching the heights of their prime and only capable of unleashing an abomination like 2016\u2019s The Astonishing if they ever attempt anything beyond the boundaries of pleasant stagnancy. Even the first listen of their fifteenth outing, A View from the Top of the World, can be summed up with a shrugged \u201cyep, this sure is a Dream Theater record, all right.\u201d\n\nWith that said, it\u2019s hard to remember the last time Dream Theater\u2019s musicianship sounded this lively. While this album doesn\u2019t directly follow the overt heaviness of Distance Over Time, the turnaround that was established there is followed up here with even more vibrant performances. The usual dynamics are certainly in place with the guitars and keyboards leading the way for the intricate rhythms to follow, but the playing is fluid and the tones benefit from an organic heft that keeps from feeling too chunky. The vocals also seem to be considerably more comfortable this time around, still largely focused on a safe range but with a less processed feel than the last couple efforts. A mix/master courtesy of Andy Sneap might\u2019ve also played a hand in boosting the presentation.\n\nOf course, the songwriting runs through the usual assortment of Dream Theater tropes with the seven tracks bringing about a varied sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Lead single \u201cThe Alien\u201d kicks things off with an immediate recollection of \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies\u201d with its lengthy shred-friendly intro and heavy transitions while \u201cTranscending Time\u201d serves as the mandatory Rush worship song. \u201cInvisible Monster\u201d and \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d are the album\u2019s most memorable tracks, the former putting in a nice series of hooks and the latter having an arguably more substantial epic presence than the twice-as-long title track.\n\nBut for all the efficiency that this album has going for it, the seeming lack of personality that defines modern Dream Theater is becoming impossible to ignore. While the musicianship and material reflect the band\u2019s signature characteristics on a superficial level, the quirks that truly defined them have gotten phased out in recent years. I find myself yearning for the days when they openly flaunted their non-Rush influences, weirdly oversharing lyrics, and more overt aesthetic motifs. Considering how acolytes like Haken and others are beating them at their own game at this point, it would be nice to have something to hang onto beyond basic familiarity.\n\nLike the other albums in Dream Theater\u2019s post-Portnoy era, I feel rather conflicted about A View from the Top of the World. It would be the best album in over a decade if we were going by the playing alone, which sees everybody at the top of their game and sounding refreshed, but the songwriting continues down the path of unexceptional serviceability. It\u2019s becoming clear that Dream Theater will stay in this plateau and go through these motions for the rest of their career barring a major shakeup or another attempt at an ill-fated high concept. Fans will fan, detractors will detract, the press will consider it a return to form, and the world will keep spinning. I\u2019m not mad or even disappointed, just favorably indifferent.\n",
        "\nDream Theater are, in a lot of ways, the essence of what progressive metal is. Not only as a band, but as a musical institution; what they represent in a bigger scale. While they weren't the first ones, with acts like Fates Warning and Crimson Glory preceding them, it's undeniable that the release of Images And Words back in 1992 shacked not only the progressive metal scene, but also everything that identifies itself as progressive music; in a nutshell, Dream Theater were for the late 90s and 2000s what bands like Yes and King Crimson were on the 70s, being the main influence of hundred of future prog metal bands. Circus Maximus, Haken, Leprous, Caligula's House and Pain's Salvation are, among others, some of the bands that name Dream Theater's as their primary influence. Bottom line is, even if you feel that their music suck, their role on the revalorization of the prog sphere can't be overlooked.\n\nAnd if there's something Dream Theater receives on the daily is the reminder that their music in fact suck. Tasteless and soulless instrumental wankery are some of the (in my opinion, undeserved) criticism the band gets. Personally, I'd argue Dream Theater can the opposite; their music and lyrics can be so emotional to the point of cheesiness. But in an earnest way. This sentiment dates all the way back and it's a stigma the band hasn't been able to shake off.\n\nWith that being said, Dream Theater is still here releasing their 15th album, A View From The Top Of The World, which shows us a revitalized band. This is easily the most energetic the guys have sounded since 2007's Systematic Chaos, and it's a more than respectable addition to their ever expanding catalogue.\n\nThe album starts with lead single The Alien, which displays a sweep of technically that doesn't bore you in it's 9 minute and a half duration. John Petrucci demonstrates once again why he's one of the greatest guitar players, being highly skillful and melodic at the same time. His first solo that starts over the 1:14 minute mark is proof of that. While this isn't one of their most original songs, it's balls to the wall approach shows that Dream Theater isn't a band that rest on their laurels, bringing an 110% effort every time they perform. That same level of energy permeates the rest of the album, with Sleeping Giant and Awaken The Master being other highlights, with the latter being Petrucci's first attempt at writing with a 8-string, and boy do it shows (thankfully it doesn't turn into Djent Theater).\n\nSo the music by itself is great so far, but so were in A Dramatic Turn Of Events and the self titled album, but the subpar mixing crippled their enjoyment. Thankfully this isn't the case here, as the album's production is nothing but top notch. Produced by Andy Sneap, who also oversaw 2020's Petrucci's solo album Terminal Velocity, gives the band the sound they deserved without the faults of the last four albums. I'd argue it sounds better than some of their classic albums too, like Scenes From a Memory, since everybody's instruments are given enough space to shine and can be easily listenable without sacrificing punch. Specially John Myung's basslines, whose grooviness can finally be enjoyed to the fullest\n\nLaBrie's vocals, much like the rest of the album, don't sound like he's struggling to reach the highest notes possible, while also not sounding like he's constraining himself, keeping himself in a sane mid range. Which is fine by me, since another of LaBrie's positives as a vocalist is the warmth of his vocals. Overall, a step up over the overly processed singing from Distance Over Time.\n\nSongs like Transcending Time and Answering The Call are great, with the former being one of their best Rush-like songs, and its upbeat energy bringing a nice change of pace to the heaviness prior. But the real meat that everybody was waiting for when the tracklist was announced was the final, 20+ minute long title track. Dream Theater are masters when it comes to developing big epics on their albums, with songs like Octavarium, A Change Of Seasons and In The Presence of Enemies being some of their most accomplished compositions (and that's not all of them!). Needless to say, AVFTTOTW had some serious competition, and while I don't think it's necessary better than any of the aforementioned (it may be better than Illumination Theory tho) it's still a sonic journey. Noteworthy how heavy it is, with a beautiful striped back middle section, before picking up the heaviness, finishing with a soaring ending.\n\nOverall, A View From The Top Of The World shows just what the title says; a band that has reached the full of its potential and aren't planning on slacking off. While not one of my personal favorites, this is still an amazing display of music and an example of Dream Theater's prowess not only as a band, but as the representatives of progressive metal. The sleeping giant is asleep no longer.\n",
        "\nI got into Dream Theater with their 2011 album A Dramatic Turn of Events. That album was the start of a very important journey for me with this band. They would go on to be my most scrobbled band, as well as the band I\u2019ve spent the most hours listening to overall. Of course a lot of that has to do with the length of their songs and albums, but still this is a band where I know every album and every song intimately and I\u2019m always excited to review a new DT album. A View from the Top of the World is possibly the heaviest album they've written since Train of Thought, but rather than being dark and grim this album is bright and full of hope without being too cheesy.\u00a0\n\n\nNow to put this album in the proper context I think it\u2019s important to talk about the band\u2019s output since Portnoy left. A Dramatic Turn of Events is actually my favorite DT album (followed closely by Images and Words), but to me that is the album that represents what I love most about modern DT. The Self Titled follow up album has a completely different feel and sound to it, but that\u2019s what makes it special to me. It might not be their best album, but it\u2019s probably the most unique album they had released since... Six Degrees? Then we got The Astonishing; sadly I never got to see them perform that album in its entirety live, but I think I would have appreciated it more. The bottom line is that The Astonishing is 34 tracks long and only like 5 maybe 6 of them are any good, no matter how good those 5/6 songs are, even a 6 out of 34 is like 17% and that\u2019s just never going to be good enough. I appreciated how they tried to explore their own sound and songwriting approach and I think songs like \"The Gift of Music\" and \"A New Beginning\" are legitimately among the best things they\u2019ve written, if only the rest of the album was that good. Distance Over Time is an interesting one. Personally I feel that it\u2019s half amazing, and half bland and boring. Songs like \"Paralyzed\", \"Room 137\", and \"Out of Reach\" are just bland and easily skippable. Even \"Untethered Angels\" (a decent song) feels pretty generic for the band. However, \"Barstool Warrior\", \"At Wit\u2019s End\", and \"Pale Blue Dot\" are absolutely fantastic and once again, if only the rest of the album was that good. So just looking at Dream Theater\u2019s last four albums I would put A View from the Top of the World above the last two easily and I would say it\u2019s comparable quality wise with the self titled (it won\u2019t be dethroning ADToE anytime soon though). In some ways this album reminds me of Octavarium, minus the incredibly cheesy ballads and for the most part this album gets back to that aggressive and technically impressive sound that we all fell in love with. I know this is kind of a long album at 70 minutes, but somehow this album feels like they cut a lot of the excess fat out of their songwriting, and despite the longer track lengths I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much at all in those songs that doesn\u2019t need to be there, and more importantly no songs that feel like filler.\u00a0\n\n\nAt first when I listened to \"The Alien\" I was not impressed; I liked it enough, but it felt like it was just \u201canother Dream Theater song\u201d like a very typical opener for them. Of course the more I have listened to it, the more I have come to appreciate it. I still think the two singles off this album are the weakest songs, but they\u2019re fine and \"The Alien\" actually has a really emotive closing that I now love. The songs that really caught my attention on this were \"Answering the Call\" and especially \"Transcending Time\", which is now my favorite song on the album. What can I say, I like it when Dream Theater tries to sound like Rush; \"The Gift of Music\", \"Through the Looking Glass\", \"S2N\" all of these songs seem to me like Dream Theater has been trying to step into the void that Rush left behind in the music scene. Whether or not they are succeeding is debatable, but I appreciate how much they like Rush and sometimes emulate them. Now what I really need is a Dream Theater covering Rush album. Seriously guys, think how awesome that would be. Sorry for the Rush tangent, but I felt it was necessary. Anyway \"Answering the Call\" feels like a callback to \"Panic Attack\" to me, it might not be as good as \"Panic Attack\", but it\u2019s a very worthwhile track with a really interesting hook and some of the heaviest riffs on the album. But most importantly it has that relentless energy that makes \"Panic Attack\" and similar songs so good. \"Transcending Time\" though is a truly special track; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve heard a Dream Theater song that hooked me like this since \"Breaking All Illusions\". Like I mentioned before it\u2019s got that Rush kinda feel, which really just means a very upbeat and hopeful kind of progressive rock, with a slightly harder edge.\u00a0 I love that guitar tone Petrucci uses for songs like this because it really is reminiscent of Alex Lifeson, though of course with his own flare. Rather than go through this track step by step I\u2019ll give you the broad strokes; the keyboard work on this song is some of the strongest on the entire album, and it\u2019s because the main melody of this song is just so strong and memorable. The harmonies add a real sense of depth to this song and I especially love how they take the melodies and harmonies and use them like a leitmotif throughout the song as each instrument takes them does something slightly different with them. This might be a seven and a half minute song, but I still find myself wanting more when I finish. The final repetition of the chorus is absolutely gorgeous and I just can\u2019t stop listening to this song.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about the longest tracks; \"Sleeping Giant\" and \"A View from the Top of the World\". Supposedly the band wrote the title track first and kind of designed the rest of the album around that idea, which is interesting, but the title track is definitely not the best track on the album. I'll talk about \"Sleeping Giant\" first though because it was probably the song that took me the longest to really appreciate. Interestingly it\u2019s the most orchestral song on the album and almost more \u201cepic\u201d than the title track. I say that because as much as I enjoy the 20 minute title track, it\u2019s incredibly predictable, whereas this song takes some twists and turns that I wasn\u2019t really expecting. I\u2019ll talk more about the title track in a moment, but \"Sleeping Giant\" is a bit denser and maybe less immediately catchy on first listen. However on repeat listens I realized just how much there is to unpack with this song, it\u2019s not unmemorable or boring it\u2019s just as dense and intricate as I would describe some of their best material. \"Sleeping Giant\" ended up being very appropriately named and I appreciate that it applies to both the structure of the song itself as well as the lyrics.\u00a0\n\n\nOkay now I\u2019m going to talk about the title track. How much you enjoy this track will ultimately come down to how much you like Dream Theater as a band, and as a discography. No joke, this song really feels like they took bits and pieces of every DT epic before it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a good song, I actually really enjoy it, however I can\u2019t get rid of this feeling that \u201cA View from the Top of the World\u201d has no identity of its own. The closest it comes is during the chorus in the first seven minutes. Past that it\u2019s really just a greatest hits of Dream Theater showing off their musical expertise. In Sleeping Giant the solos actually informed the rest of the song. They acted as real transitions that felt natural whereas here it feels more like \u201cwell what else can we do?\u201d. Let\u2019s run through Dream Theater\u2019s 20+ minute epics real quick: \"A Change of Seasons\" has some of the most emotionally convincing melodies of their career; \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" also has great emotion and each part of that song feels like a miniature masterpiece, the only problem with it is that rather than sounding like one song, it sounds like 6. \"Octavarium\" is all about the slow burn and the epic solos (that actually utilize the themes and inform the rest of the music) and even if the beginning is a little slow for some people, I think it\u2019s safe to call \"Octavarium\" a prog masterpiece. Then we have \"In the Presence of Enemies\" which is dark and moody and it opens with one of my favorite DT riffs ever. \"Illumination Theory\" is just fun, it\u2019s got some of Myung\u2019s best bass work to date, it\u2019s got several excellent melodies and each part of the song is fun and unique with a very emotive and satisfying ending. Oh and the orchestral development section is beautiful (and much better than the one in \"A View from the Top of the World\" for me).\n\n\nGetting back to the album I\u2019m actually reviewing right now; this song has maybe two aspects that I find unique and interesting enough to be memorable and worth praise. The chorus really is phenomenal, it reminds me of the kind of hooks they were writing back on A Dramatic Turn of Events, which are more progressive power metal in general. Then the ending is (mostly) great. Despite what I said about a lot of the solos in this song not really informing the rest of the song, I will say the part starting around 14 minutes really worked for me and built up to the finale magnificently. Now I have to talk about the finale, which is kind of weird. It\u2019s just strange how the song ends, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who will feel that way. It almost sounds like it\u2019s building up to yet another finale, but then it just ends. I don\u2019t mind that they ended it, but I question what purpose that riff at the end serves. I\u2019ve listened to it over and over again and I just don\u2019t understand quite what the band was going for with the ending. It's odd and the album ends on a strange cadence, but at least they did something off the beaten path for the big title track. I\u2019m torn on the epic guys I really am, it has some awesome moments, but then it has moments that feel like the band has been there and done that before, or moments that just feel disconnected from the rest of the music on the song, and the album as a whole.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is kind of a weird album to review as a lot of Dream Theater\u2019s discography is. I love that they got back to longer song forms, with only seven tracks and I think they use the song lengths really well. However there is a feeling I cannot banish from my heart no matter how hard I try. I constantly feel throughout the album that the band has been there and done this before. Now I know there\u2019s really nothing new under the sun and I am usually very forgiving on this front. However the thought underlying that feeling is that I don\u2019t know how much more Dream Theater has to creatively offer to the music world. This is one of my favorite bands in the world, but I feel like they have plateaued. A friend of mine has a saying, there\u2019s a certain threshold of doing something amazing, where I can only be amazed so much. Yes the musicianship of Dream Theater is stellar and they can be emotive and silly and so much fun, yet I think their originality is slipping away from them. I don\u2019t like to critique without at least providing an example of what I would do were I in the band\u2019s shoes. My favorite material off their last 4 albums has been songs like \u201cThrough the Looking Glass\", \"The Gift of Music\", \"A New Beginning\" , \"Barstool Warrior\", \"S2N\", and \"Transcending Time\". Personally I think they should dig into those songs and write an entire album that sounds like that, but only time will tell and no band should be beholden to their critics. I hope that Dream Theater can figure out a direction and an identity to stick with for the next decade because I won\u2019t lie, the last decade for them has been all over the place.\n\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\nLost Not Forgotten Archives: A Dramatic Tour of Events \u2013 Select Board Mixes is the second release in the new Dream Theater archives series started earlier this year. This double-album had been released digitally as Happy Holidays seven and a half years earlier. Only adamant collectors will be willing to pay roughly twenty bucks for a release that was a free download just to have a physical version with a new cover artwork.\n\nThe release itself has more positive than negative elements to offer. On the positive side, this record offers two discs with a total of thirteen songs and a running time of two hours. The selected tracks include some intriguing rarities such as power ballad ''Peruvian Skies'', narrative progressive metal epic ''The Great Debate'' and the airy, dreamy and imaginative ''The Count of Tuscany'' that clocks in at just under twenty-two minutes. The musicianship is excellent as usual. New drummer Mike Mangini is given the occasion to shine in his ''Drum Solo'' as well as in the diversified instrumental ''Ytse Jam''. Quiet bassist John Myung delivers the goods in the double closer consisting of his own complex epic ''Learning to Live'' and the playful, powerful and sinister ''As I Am''. Guitarist John Petrucci convinces as usual with poignant riffs as heard in ''Endless Sacrifice'' and soulful melodic guitar leads as witnessed in ''Another Day''.\n\nOn the negative side, keyboardist Jordan Rudess shines a little bit less than he usually does. There are few solo spots or improvisations to be heard and the keyboards are sometimes buried under the guitar sounds in the production. Singer James LaBrie delivers good average performances that don't match his energetic vocal skills of the nineties or his recently established more mature sound in the past few years. The crowd recordings sound canny as if they had been made with an old cell phone. This release is overall best compared to the bootleg style presented on Chaos in Motion 2007-2008.\n\nAt the end of the day, Dream Theater's Lost Not Forgotten Archives: A Dramatic Tour of Events \u2013 Select Board Mixes is a good but not excellent live document that is only interesting for adamant collectors and faithful fans. Occasional fans can skip this release without any regrets but should check out other releases in the archives series such as the excellent Lost Not Forgotten Archives: Images and Words - Live in Japan, 2017.\n",
        "\nDream Theater's Images and Words - Live in Japan, 2017 is the first entry in the relaunched Lost Not Forgotten Archives series. The band has been around for more than three and a half decades now and has released so many records and played so many concerts that such releases are particularly rewarding for fans of old date like myself.\n\nThis particular record captures the band at the height of its career. The musicianship is out of this world. John Myung is a versatile, steady and resilient bass guitar player who doesn't need to be in the spotlight to convince with his perfect balance between feeling and technique that forms the backbone of his band's unique progressive metal sound. \n\nJohn Petrucci might be the greatest contemporary guitar player to be around. He convinces in atmospheric instrumental sections, heartfelt slow-paced ballads, menacing and heavy mid-paced stompers, fast-paced and nearly frantic sections and plays one breathtaking solo after another. \n\nJordan Rudess complements him perfectly on keyboards as the wizard offers everything from cinematic background layers over smooth, enchanting and dreamy passages to ecstatic solos duelling the guitar performances. \n\nMike Mangini has become more than a replacement for original drummer Mike Portnoy. He doesn't only have the variable technical skills of his predecessor but also the understanding when to push things forward and when to recede into the background to give the music space and time to breathe. The latter quality has always been completely oblivious to Mike Portnoy. This particular album includes laid-back drum passages as well as a memorable solo that never gets boring throughout three highly entertaining minutes. \n\nSinger James LaBrie is often described as the band's weakest member as fans of old date claim that he has never fully recovered from a case of food poisoning in the mid-nineties or that his voice has become significantly weaker throughout the past decade. Both statements are half-truths as James LaBrie's vocal register might have become lower as time has come by but his voice nevertheless still breathes emotional life into his band's technically appealing instrumental work. The Canadian singer is the heart of Dream Theater and after having watched the band perform seven times in the past twelve years, I can guarantee you that his performances are still absolutely stunning and better than those of most other metal singers of his age. This album is a testament to his under-appreciated talent.\n\nThe eight songs offered on this output convince with an energetic production in which each instrument shines vibrantly while the enthusiastic Japanese crowd is audible from start to finish. \n\nHighlights include the powerful, passionate and focused performance of the band's only hit single ''Pull Me Under'', the breathtaking ballad ''Surrounded'' that sends shivers down the spine of anyone who has a heart and the incredible rendition of ''Metropolis (Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper)'' that includes the aforementioned outstanding drum solo and remains entertaining through thirteen minutes of progressive metal mastery. \n\nThis release comes around in a solid digipak but doesn't include a booklet as it focuses on the music alone. There is also an expensive vinyl version for sophisticated connoisseurs stuck in nostalgia with too much money on their hands but the CD version takes less space, sounds perfect and costs a lot less.\n\nIf compared to the studio album of the same name, this live performance recorded twenty-five years later is even more courageous, dynamic and imaginative. This record simply doesn't get boring as I have listened to it at least ten times since buying it roughly a month and a half ago. This release isn't as easy to find as the band's regular studio or live albums but you should certainly try to purchase a copy since this release captures the band's excellent chemistry in its most accomplished line-up to date. Anyone who appreciates progressive rock or progressive metal should call this release their own.\n",
        "\nRegarded as the grandfathers of the progressive metal genre, Dream Theater had, and still have, an intriguing career to say the least. From revolutionising and giving exposure to highly technical Rush-meet-metal riffing in the 90s with albums like Images And Words and Awake to overly-long rock operas with also a big Rush influence in The Astonishing, it's easy to see why the Long Island quintet has its fair share of fanboys and haters. Personally, I must admit I'm incredibly biased towards Dream Theater. They're my favorite band, both within the confines of metal and music as a whole. John Petrucci, John Myung, Jordan Rudess, Mike Mangini and (yes, he too) James LaBrie expose such strong musical wiring between each one that taking the band as more of a five men orchestra than a metal band isn't hyperbole, but a fitting description.\n\nIt isn't a well grounded secret that 2016's The Astonishing was their most ambitious and polarizing project in their 30 year career. Some people loved the blend of progressive rock, symphonic orchestrations and Broadway-like storyline of the album, while others criticized the musical sameyness of the 34 track opus. While the album wasn't perfect, I can't help but love how the cheesy as fuck story that reads like a Disney remake of 2112 mixes with the music, that can be both frantic and beautiful. But the fact of the matter is that the album got mixed reception. How could Dream Theater go from there?\n\nGoing back to the basics, naturally.\n\nAnd that's what Distance over Time is in a nutshell. A modest display of technicality that doesn't imply a lack of great songwriting. And the songs here are (with one exception) nothing short of amazing. Songs like Untethered Angel, Fall into the Light and S2N are examples of good, to the point, highly technical prog metal exhibitions that don't overstay their welcome. The album runtime doesn't even hit the hour, something unheard of a Dream Theater album since their modest 1989's debut When Day and Dream Unite.\n\nBut the best song has to be At Wit's End hands down. Everything from the clean licks to the absolute crushing riffing (for DT's standards at least) and the soaring LaBrie's vocals, specially on the second, more mellow half of the song, makes it a standout. The main guitar solo on Barstool Warrior is one of Petrucci's absolute best, being both shreddy and emotional, much in the same vein as the iconic The Best of Times' solo (which is, in my personal opinion, his peak as a guitar player).\n\nThe only song that I felt was a stinker was Out of Reach, a sappy ballad that kinda goes through the motion and you forget once it finishes. Even as someone who dearly loves DT's ballads like The Answer Lies Within and This is The Life, this one is one of their most boring songs.\n\nOne thing that I should point out is how great the production is here, specially in the Blu-ray stereo edition. The mixing is cristal clear, giving every and each instrument a good, punchy sound. Especially Myung's bass tone, which hasn't sounded this good since, hell, this is THE best he's ever sounded. Same with Mangini's kit, who hits them drums like a deadbeat dad beats his son. This great level of mixing was severely missing in past albums like A Dramatic Turn of Events and the self titled.\n\nOverall, this was a much needed return to basic's album after The Astonishing that showed doubtful fans that lost faith in Dream Theater's ability to write progressive metal on the level of past albums. While not my favorite from them, even counting the other three albums released in the 2010s, it's still an invigorating listen that reminds me just how talented, both technically and songwriting-wise, Dream Theater is.\n",
        "\nHow does a band follow up what is quite possible the most commercially successful progressive metal album of all time?; They don't. Instead, they recreate their entire sound and create something even better. Though Images and Words is (and will likely always be) the band's most commercially successful album, it certainly isn't their creative peak. Following intense touring for their 1992 classic, the band reentered the studio to craft another masterpiece. The label expected another Images and Words, but Dream Theater were determined to push their sound forward and not make the same album a second time. Images and Words encapsulates the highly produced, \"poppy\" side of Dream Theater, while Awake does something completely different; its creates the deepest, darkest, and most expansive atmosphere in the band's history.\n\nThough the band had been using samples throughout their previous work, this album likely has the most prominent use of them (other than The Astonishing, but these samples were made specifically for the album, and not borrowed from a movie or show). This contributes to the atmosphere exponentially, and provides several proactive moments throughout the entirety of the album. Songs like 6:00, Voices, and Space Dye Vest have movie samples perfectly placed within their runtimes, and no song overuses these samples. \n\nAnother one of the greatest strengths of Awake is the length/pacing of the album. There are 11 tracks within the 75 minute run time of the album. Depending on how you view the album, there one, two, or three \"epics\" (in this case, I am considering an epic a song that is 10 minutes or longer). That may not make sense at first, but here is the explanation; when recording the album, the band wanted to continue down the path of writing longer songs. The label discouraged it. Instead of rewriting tracks, the band decided to cut the songs up and have them lead into each other. The two cases where this occurred was between The Mirror/Lie, and A Mind Beside Itself suite (Erotomania, Voices, and The Silent Man). There is even a third instance where Lifting Shadows Off A Dream blends into Scarred, but this one is less notable. Taking this into account, if offers two distinct ways to listen to the album, therefore making the album an even more engaging experience. There is so much more to talk about when it comes to this album.\n\nAwake is, in my opinion, the Dream Theater album with the best production. I typically refer to the production as open, airy, and hollow (in a good way). The guitar cuts through the mix perfectly, but isn't overly prominent. The drums have a very similar production to A Change Of Seasons (specifically the track itself, as the rest of the EP has a different drum sound since they are live tracks), and it remains as my favorite drum sound in the entirety of Dream Theater's massive discography. Awake also contains some of the most prominent contributions within John Myung's career, as the bass features prominently on tracks like Scarred and Lifting Shadows Off A Dream. The vocal performance by James LaBrie is arguably the best of his entire (studio) career. On I&W, James already had the immense range within his pitch, but here, James also adds an amazing range of dynamics to his vocals. With the initiation of seven string guitars into the music of Dream Theater, there was a need for some more aggressive vocals during some parts of the songs. The beautiful vocal sections are still here, such as the vocals on Lifting Shadows Off A Dream, but LaBrie implements some harsher, more \"metal\" or \"thrashy\" vocals when the music calls for it, such as during 6:00 and Lie. Finally, we reach Kevin Moore. This album is his last performance as a member of Dream Theater. Not only is it his last studio performance, its his final performance as a whole, since he left right at the end of the album's completion, not even touring with DT for this album. As someone who considers all three Dream Theater keyboardists practically equal, I will say that this album contains one of the best keyboard/piano performances in the band's history. Moore's keyboard generally isn't the most prominent instrument on this album (with the exception of Space Dye Vest of course), and he has few solos, but his performance makes an even more important contribution; it practically holds the atmosphere of the album together. His instrumentation, songwriting, and chord choices on this album are why it is one of the best Dream Theater albums of all time. In short, Kevin's playing on this album is legendary, and along with LaBrie's vocal performance, it is the highlight of the album.\n\nThough I've practically said everything that I can about the music, there is one other things that this album does exceptionally well; presentation through its album art. This is hands down the greatest Dream Theater album cover of all time, and quite possibly one of the greatest album covers in music history. It perfectly encapsulates the music and atmosphere contained within Awake, and the level of detail and care put into this piece of art is unparalleled throughout the rest of their discography. I personally theorize that this is the scene outside of the window that is shown on the cover of Images And Words. My two favorite details on the cover of Awake are the factories in the background and the scene within the mirror. The factories are shadowed in the background, and carry a level of mystery and curiosity with them. The scene inside of the mirror presents a world that you want explored on future album covers (which as far as I know, sadly never occurred). This is one of those album covers that the audience can't help but analyze every detail of, and 25 years later, it is still the bands best album art.\n\nWith all of this said, it misses out on receiving a perfect score by just three percent. This is for two minor issues related to the track list, and both are simply my personal opinion. First, I believe that Eve should have been included on this album. Its a beautiful song, and though I wouldn't trade any of the tracks out for the inclusion of Eve, it still should have been included. My second, and even more nit-picky complaint is that A Change Of Seasons wasn't included on this album either. Of course, it was intended to be a track on Images and Words, but that never came to fruition, so this was basically their last chance to record the Moore version of the song properly in the studio. In all honesty, I would have preferred for it to specifically be a bonus track, because I would have still liked the band to record the Sherinian version as well. Wishful thinking, but one can dream (no pun intended). With the inability to craft a double album during these early years of the band's career, it obviously isn't their fault. But these two minor complaints, along with the fact that some of the tracks are less impactful than others, are the reasons that this album doesn't quite receive a perfect 100% score. However, this album is still an essential listen, and when I ask myself what my favorite Dream Theater albums are (and Dream Theater is my favorite band), I typically have Awake as the second or third best. In conclusion, this album pushed the band even further creatively, putting the \"progressive\" in progressive metal, and proved to the world that Dream Theater were leaders and innovators in both metal music and progressive music. Awake is an essential listening experience, and even 25 years later, it still has an immense impact on those fortunate enough to give it a chance and listen to it.\n",
        "\nImages And Words; Arguably the most overrated and underrated album in all of progressive metal. Within the progressive metal fan base (and quite honestly, the metal fan base as a whole), you'll be hard-pressed to find somebody who hasn't heard Pull Me Under at least once. The same goes for Metropolis (Part 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper), but to a lesser extent. When dealing with what is considered the bands most commercially and culturally successful album to date, it can be hard to separate biases and accusations of the band \"selling out,\" by writing songs that are generally far less heavy than some of the albums that would follow this one. However, those who choose to avoid this album for its supposed, \"commercialistic design,\" will be missing out on some of the strongest material written within the band's 30+ year career.\n\nThe journey starts at the album cover; arguably one of Dream Theater's best and most memorable album covers. With art direction being credited to Larry Freemantle (who is credited in the art direction role for my three favorite Dream Theater album covers), its instantly misguiding. The average music fan approaching this album cover with no knowledge of the band would likely never be able to predict the genre that DT represents (that being progressive metal). The album has a serene beauty to it, one that can be viewed and analyzed time and time again. It brings with it a level of visual nostalgia that can't be pinpointed from any particular source. Though the cover doesn't seem to be one that would associate itself with the genre of metal, it fits immaculately with Dream Theater's music during this era; mysterious, beautiful, raw, and full of contrast. \n\nAs for the music, there's a reason that this remains the band's most commercially successful album. This is especially apparent with the first two track. Pull Me Under broke barriers for progressive music when it was first released, and to this day is still the band's most popular song. Another Day is a wonderfully soft song that takes full advantage of session musician Jay Beckenstein's beautiful saxophone skills. However, past these two track are some of Dream Theater's hidden gems; songs that deserve equal recognition to the two previously listed (as well as Metropolis). Take The Time is the closest Dream Theater has ever approached the genre of funk, and also contains of of Kevin Moore's best keyboard solos. Surrounded is a beautiful, poppy song, one that uses its short length to pace the album. Under A Glass Moon contains one of Petrucci's best guitar solos, perfectly representing his unique style of soloing during the early 90's era of DT's career. Wait For Sleep/Learning To Live tie perfectly together, with the latter being one of the most underrated Dream Theater songs of all time. Learning To Live is filled with beautiful melodies, trademark Dream Theater experimentation, and amazing LaBrie vocals. The eight songs that comprise this album combine to make Images And Words one of the most memorable musical experiences of all time.\n\nWith all of these praises, why doesn't this album receive a 100% score? Simple; the label messed with bands original vision. Dream Theater originally envisioned Images And Words as a double album, and was meant to contain the original version of A Change Of Seasons on it. This version is just under 20 minutes long, and a video of this version being played live on 3/4/1993 exists and is on YouTube. I personally prefer this version to the one that ended up on the 1995 EP of the same name, but only slightly, and A Change Of Seasons is my favorite song of all time, so I'm very happy that there are two versions of the song for me to enjoy. This doesn't negatively effect the album however, it simply keeps it from attaining an even higher score than it already has.\n\nIn conclusion, this spectacular album deserves the praise that it receives from fans and critics, but the real gems and highlights are hidden below the surface level, sometimes overshadowed by the three most popular songs on the album (Metropolis, Pull Me Under, and Another Day). This album is an absolute must listen for any fan of prog or metal, and deserves its status as one of, if not the absolute definitive shining moment of progressive metal.\n",
        "\nNearly anyone who is familiar with Dream Theater understands and admires the band's tendency to take things to the extreme. Whether it be time signature changes, speed, song length, album length, etc., Dream Theater knows how to do it, and specifically, they know how to do it better than practically all of their contemporaries. Following the release of the legendary Images And Words, Dream Theater made their first official live album. Only 5 years into the bands existence (8 if their time as Majesty is considered), this live effort by the band is far more shorter than all of their other live albums. At slightly over 45 minutes, Live At The Marquee is even shorter than any of the band's studio albums. \n\nWith the band having already released two studio albums, both over the fifty minute mark, its evident that many songs were absent from the set. However, the album doesn't suffer from this in the slightest. The album contains the biggest hits from Images And Words (Metropolis Part 1 and Pull Me Under), some of the best songs off of When Dream And Day Unite, and even a live improvised track (Bombay Vindaloo). However, though the set doesn't hurt the album, more tracks may have significantly strengthened the album (this will be touched upon more towards the end of the review). This album features the \"classic\" lineup of Dream Theater, and in the eyes of many, the best lineup they've had. Kevin, James, John, John, and Mike, even so early into their careers, are world class musicians and songwriters. \n\nIn regards to the music (and specifically the performance of the music on this record), it is absolutely incredible). All five musicians on this album play perfectly, with many of the songs on this album arguably being better than their studio counterparts. However, one man stands above the rest here; James LaBrie. This is, without a doubt, the strongest vocal performance on an official Dream Theater album, only matched and exceeded by bootlegs recorded around the same time as this performance (1992-1995). Songs like Metropolis Part 1 and Another Hand/The Killing Hand have some of the highest, strongest, and most awe-inspiring vocal passages LaBrie has committed to record. LaBrie takes passages he recorded on Images And Words (as well as passages Dominici recorded on When Dream And Day Unite) and changes note placement, increasing the aggression that this album so incredibly delivers to the listener. Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung, and Moore all deserve their own respective praise as well. The band meshes so well together in this live setting, and that live energy transitions flawlessly to the album. However, there are a few things that could have been different to make this album even better.\n\nThe most glaring thing that this album is missing is length. Every listen of this album feels like it is over far too soon. Three tracks should have been added to the set to make this album perfect; Under A Glass Moon, Learning To Live, and A Change Of Seasons (especially LtL and ACoS). All three of these songs were in set list rotation in 1993, and all three of them are among the strongest songs Dream Theater have ever created. It would have also been nice to have an official recording of the prototype version of A Change Of Seasons (that isn't from a bootleg or fan club release). The inclusion of these three tracks would have easily given this album a perfect score of 100%, but don't let the shorter length take away from the album. Arguably one of the strongest live progressive rock/metal albums of all time, Dream Theater's Live At The Marquee, even over 25 years after its release, is a must have live album for Dream Theater fans and progressive metal fans as a whole. Strongly recommended.\n",
        "\nThis album I didn't listen to for a very long time, partly due to the strange album cover, and partly due to a lack of LaBrie. However, I was pleasantly surprised the first time I heard it, as for such a young band at the time the songs really are fantastic. Classic DT.\n\nBefore I get to the music, there are a few things. This is the only Dominici album, and it is understandable why he only lasted as long as he did. His vocals are subpar to say the least, now I'm not bashing him as a vocalist generally because his solo albums are great and I think he outdid LaBrie on 'When Dream and Day Reunite', but on 'The Killing Hand' the high notes just aren't satisfying like on the Marquee album for example. This can be seen on the verse of 'Afterlife' as well. But this doesn't matter a whole lot, as the songs make up for it. \n\nAnother thing about this album is the poor production. Compare this to 'Images and Words', just a few years later and there is a huge difference. Not that this matters a whole lot either because of the music, but it is something to note. Would I have noticed this, however, if this was the only DT album I had ever heard? Probably not.\n\nTo the music: apart from sounding rather Rush-like, which is never a problem in my eyes, it shows the clear foundations of Dream Theater's future music. 'Afterlife' and 'A Fortune In Lies' stand out to me as being the most accessible, with catchy choruses and blazing guitar solos. 'Status Seeker' tries to be accessible, but perhaps stands out too much in doing so. 'Light Fuse and Get Away' has the best chorus of the album in my opinion. 'Ytse Jam' bored me honestly, it is perhaps one of the worse Dream Theater instrumentals out there, but at least they tried. 'Only A Matter Of Time' and 'The One Who Help To Set The Sun' are the final two tracks of the album, both solid tracks again.\n\nThis is an infinitely more interesting album than, say, 'Distance Over Time', as the flair and excitement is still there. The tracks burst with energy and will invigorate you. The vocals are the make or break here. \n\nI haven't been overly praising here, so why 80%?, you may ask. Well, many of the songs from here are featured in later live albums and are performed to a much higher standard. I would recommend listening to those first of all, and if you truly love the songs then come back here and try it. I recommend 'Afterlife' on Score to start with, 'Only A Matter Of Time' from Budokan is also fantastic. It is on those performances you can hear the true glory of the tracks, and that is worth a high rating alone.\n",
        "\nDream Theater has not interested me much since Train of Thought. Once they decided to try adding the \"tough\" elements I lost interest. And I've checked in on them from time to time in the last however many years to find music that stirs little more than indifference. \n\nSince Train of Thought, they seemed to be sticking with this heavier, modern, down-tuned sound. It's this aspect that turned me off. Always felt forced, and honestly kind of cringy with the tough guy vocals by Portnoy in particular. But they finally seemed to have settled in and got it right ... yeah, only took 16 years.\n\nThe framework of this album is that groovy, modern, slick sound, with an honest-to-goodness focus on the riffs. Yes, I dare say, in terms of metal riffage, this is one of the strongest albums this band has produced. The sound is streamlined, the breaks into drum solos, keyboard interludes, acoustic passages, adventures through every style conceivable that the band is so well known for, is minimized - and honestly, there's nothing wrong with that. It let them focus on writing solid riffs throughout this release, and it's all the better for it. I love every manner of musicality and music idiom being tested; I also love hot sauce, but hot sauce accents the food, it's not the food itself. Seems to be the thing this band forgets too often. \n\nThe album still contains the odd meter synthy lead, the bizarre, which-way-is-it-going drum patterns, demanding advanced guitar playing, and breaks into unexpected styles. They're all just a lot less frequent. The bulk of the riffs are that chunky, grooving heavy metal sound, that they've whiffed on so much in the past, but the riffs here are, as I said, much more keenly crafted. A couple songs, like S2N and Barstool Warrior really remind me of a more chunky, driving version of some of the ideas on Falling Into Infinity. Which is strange, it's taking that kind of 90's prog sound and modernizing it; quite tactfully.\n\nJames LaBrie, always a contentious piece of the band, gives a very solid performance. His vocals are not so nasal or strained as they were at times in the past. It might be because we don't get too many striped-down moments where his voice is out front. Which I will mark as another favorable aspect of this album; very few soft, slow moments. Even more to this album credit - such moments on this album are remarkably potent. Like the breakdown in At Wit's End, really hits the nail on the head, hitting that emotional note where this band again, does tend to fail. As does the interlude in Fall Into the Light, which honestly strikes me as a late Bathory melody, strangely enough. Damn nice guitar melody.\n\nNow, I do think even though it's nice to see what the band can produce in a more streamlined fashion, I think they reigned it in a little too much. And I'm not sure if this was a conscious decision, or it happened as a result of Portnoy no longer being in the band. I am not familiar with the other albums with Mangini, but as for this album, Mike Portnoy would have served better on drums. The drumming is slightly bland for a Dream Theater album. And although the simpler style has mitigated it, the awkward songwriting choices this band makes can still be seen here. Yes, I just praised the song, for one moment, but after coming out of that interlude in Fall Into the Light, they go into this drum roll with accents thing, building up, it sounds like they want to go into all-out thrash or something - but sadly, this band never does something like that - and instead, they go into a keyboard solo? Bizarre. Bad habits die hard, I suppose.\n\nThe best thing this band could do is stick with this blueprint, and just mix a bit more whimsy back into the fold. Pale Blue Dot is a great example of what I think they should aim for, lot of changes, lots of cool rhythmic ideas, but it doesn't make the song come unglued. I would single that track as well as At Wit's End as highlight.\n",
        "\nThe best studio album of Dream Theater can be traced down right here and as you see, that\u2019s hardly saying much. Awake is yet another ambitious effort of these guys that turns out to be too problematic for its own good. Even the performances are becoming more inconsistent here and I can't help but think these guys weren't allowed to contribute their own craft and that instead, they told each other what to write. That\u2019s the only logical explanation I have for this problem - Kevin Moore\u2019s keyboards become more inefficient, James LaBrie tries to show his tough side with mixed results and John Petrucci tries out his new toy, which doesn\u2019t all work out for the best either.\n\nAwake sees Dream Theater slipping into darker territory \u2013 something which on paper should work out well, but truth to be told doesn\u2019t mean that much. The two biggest differences compared to Images and Words are the vocal lines and the seven string guitars. First of all, James LaBrie doesn\u2019t sound super slick anymore; the clean vocals more often breathe more life into these songs than they did on the band\u2019s previous album, but it's the distorted approach that's rather tricky. Certain vocalists sound appealing at their more aggressive performances, but LaBrie\u2019s performance comes off rather unnatural at times. I\u2019m not talking about vocal technique here, but it\u2019s out of his vocal character, especially on ''Lie'' where the pseudo intimidating whispered/half distorted rapped delivery is just awful and that harmony halfway through is quite something, too, as it recalls an elderly tenor sounding all hysterical and pissed off at his neighbor. Regardless, \u2018\u2019Lie\u2019\u2019 is definitely the worst tune on Awake (I should mention having checked the video clip of this song where James LaBrie makes these silly moves doesn\u2019t make things better either). Second of all a few tunes here were written on a seven string guitar, which one might expect to work out for the better but that's not always the case. \u2018\u2019The Mirror\u2019\u2019 happens when you give a seven string guitar to the wrong musician - I\u2019m all for chugging but if that\u2019s basically all you do in a track, your creativity is rather out of sight - not to mention LaBrie embraces the same errors as he did in \u2018\u2019Lie\u2019\u2019 and Kevin Moore is wasting his talents here with his pseudo-spooky keys that wouldn't even scare a five year old kid.\n\nDream Theater still appear ambitious and unpredictable here so aside from the heavier tracks, you still find some ballads which for the most part aren\u2019t exactly better than the ones from Images and Words. \u2018\u2019The Silent Man\u2019\u2019 sounds so dumbed down it\u2019s not even funny \u2013 an acoustic bore which I\u2019d rather expect from a sixteen year old boy trying to impress his girlfriend with. \u2018\u2019Lifting Shadows of a Dream\u2019\u2019 is slightly better, recalling the mysterious aura that \u2018\u2019Voices\u2019\u2019 possessed, although it\u2019s not exactly inspiring, while the album closer is pure crap \u2013 this thing is called ''Space-Dye Vest'' and it comes off as melodramatic due to the keys and movie samples (seriously, when did such a thing ever work?) James LaBrie\u2019s lower register isn't all that bad for the softer tunes on this album, but he\u2019s not capable of saving this track from mediocrity \u2013 I mean it\u2019s a song about Moore falling in love with a model he\u2019s seen in a magazine for crying out loud. Look, I\u2019m all for ballads about love if 1: they\u2019re good, and 2: they\u2019re more relatable than falling in love with a magazine model. In this case neither of the two apply. Give me a break. \n\nDespite sounding harsh, Awake is not without highlights, even if there are just a few of them. I find the longer tracks to demonstrate the band at their most united and focused - while slightly overlong, \u2018\u2019Voices\u2019\u2019 does have a mysterious aura to it and slowly unfolding itself as LaBrie takes the song forward with some actual proper lines bellowing over the choppy guitar lines. \u2018\u2019Scarred\u2019\u2019 does appear somewhat loose, but the half soaring/half calming vocals resonate well with the chugged grooves and Kevin Moore\u2019s lively keys \u2013 the ending is certainly one of the more emotionally resonating moments of Dream Theater as far as I\u2019m concerned. Tracks like \u2018\u2019Caught in a Web\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Innocence Faded\u2019\u2019 are more of the instant and catchy numbers and work well, too. The former stomps with some conviction and the aggressive vocal lines match well, while the latter is a real ear-worm of a track that lives by its repeated chorus until John Petrucci turns the track into a blistering, if appropriate shred feast around the last minute.\n\nThe highlights of Awake would resulted into a decent EP, but instead this is yet another bloated and confusing release that's just not doing it for me. One last note: does anyone else think \u2018\u2019Erotomania\u2019 sounds more like a video game soundtrack than a metal tune? I can imagine that this was written to fill the space \u2013 because a one hour and eight minutes long Dream Theater album simply wouldn\u2019t have been enough, right?\n",
        "\nThere are bands that are somewhat unknown and then there are bands that you just can't get around - they just get mentioned a lot. Dream Theater fall in the latter category and whereas the band's earlier stuff is often either loved or hated, I believe the band did have the potential to deliver a classic at one point \u2013 they never did, which is a shame because the first three albums do feature a few cool tracks here and there. Unfortunately, Images and Words is a good example of such. The band is certainly trying out different things here, but sadly not with the best results.\n\nClearly more professional sounding than the debut, Images and Words welcomes James LaBrie, who\u2019s probably more accessible than his predecessor \u2013 although I should admit I\u2019m not so crazy about his role here. On one hand he does have a unique personality; you won\u2019t mistake him for a Geoff Tate clone that you\u2019d often find on earlier progressive metal records. On the other hand, I think he\u2019s playing it just a bit too safe with these super slick melodic vocal lines that are present on the majority of these tunes. For a better presentation of his style, I suggest you hear the Live at the Marquee EP, where LaBrie sounds slightly more aggressive. (Some will say Awake is his best performance, but he\u2019s rather edgy sounding on that album, which is good for a laugh, but I might save that for another review).\n\nMy biggest problem with Images and Words is how its versatility is more often a trap than a quality of Dream Theater. At its worst the result is awfully embarrassing (or laughable, depending on your sense of humor) \u2013 where the progressiveness comes off as either over-the-top or rather dry and bland during its softer moments. At its best, the band has a real thing going on for fluent ideas that do work though. Some punchy riffs do work effectively and occasionally the emotional interplay between the instruments do create magic, as I have no problem referring \u2018\u2019Learning to Live\u2019\u2019 as a progressive metal classic.\n\nFor one thing, John Petrucci doesn\u2019t always do it for me, as he\u2019s rather inconsistent and frustrating guitarist - both in the riff and lead department. At his best he\u2019s able to craft simple, crunchy riffwork found in \u2018\u2019Pull me Under\u2019\u2019, makes \u2018\u2019Learning to Live\u2019\u2019 quite a journey (which despite being one of the \u2018\u2019pure\u2019\u2019 progressive numbers on here, isn\u2019t devoid of any emotional depth) and shreds with taste and class. At his worst, he relies on lazy, dull chugs and rapidly shreds his way through certain tracks with impressive, yet exaggerated leads that I could easily do without \u2013 this is especially frustrating when the inconsistencies show up in the same track. \u2018\u2019Under a Glass Moon\u2019\u2019 has one of the laziest verse riffs I can think of, but does feature a high flying chorus with a lively riff on top and \u2018\u2019Metropolis\u2019\u2019 has a similar problem, which after some chugging (forgiven as it\u2019s just an intro), turns into a behemoth of acrobatic twists and turns between some of LaBrie\u2019s harmonies which is all great \u2013 but then an interlude leads to a solo that interrupts the flow for about four god damn minutes before the track picks up again.\n\nInterestingly enough, things starts and ends actually rather well. \u2018\u2019Pull me Under\u2019\u2019 is the heaviest piece here; chunky and bended, it\u2019s a Metallica-inspired tune (it\u2019s not quite \u2018\u2019Constant Motion\u2019\u2019, however!) Not only is it the closest the band ever got at creating a riff-happy number, it also has good sense of flow to it as it\u2019s not totally predictable, yet doesn\u2019t surprise the listener with any unnecessary moments. I\u2019m especially fond of that \u2018\u2019roller coaster\u2019\u2019 riff as I like to call it \u2013 the one that goes all over the fret board and leads to that dumb, yet catchy chorus - in this case not a problem, with a solid riff underneath. \u2018\u2019Learning to Live\u2019\u2019 shows the band at their most united - from Moore\u2019s happy keyboard introduction to the famous blistering vocal attack to the emotionally provoking guitar swings and motives of Petrruci, it\u2019s just a successful number that actually moves forward towards that incredible ending where the majestic chants appear between the soulful leads.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, Dream Theater\u2019s earlier works were ambitious as the band was clearly trying out different stuff on their first few albums (I\u2019m not quite sure about their debut anymore, but this one and Awake certainly count in this regard), but ambitious doesn't always lead to greatness. See \u2018\u2019Take the Time\u2019\u2019, which is all over the place, bloody awful and one of the most confusing tracks I can think of. It featuring James LaBrie at his most embarrassing; rapping with a slightly distorted tone over a funky bass line before the track blows in your face with an annoying chorus. I suppose the piano segments makes you want to believe the band can mix their creativity with depth, but I\u2019ll stick to \u2018\u2019Learning to Live\u2019\u2019 for that kind of thing. Other attempts at evoking sensitivity include \u2018\u2019Another Day\u2019\u2019, which doesn\u2019t even sound if the band was trying hard (lyrics aside that is), but instead just wanted to have a pure ballad on the record for the sake of it and the more climax-driven \u2018\u2019Surrounded\u2019\u2019 \u2013 which is not awful and at least works towards something at one point, even though it takes far too long to get going.\n\nWhile I definitely don\u2019t believe Images and Words (or early Dream Theater in general for that matter) deserves the hate that it gets, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it, either - I prefer my metal albums to have more than two cool songs on them, after all. This is just mediocre and I'd rather listen to other progressive metal albums instead.\n",
        "\nBefore I begin with review I must admit that I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater (from now on DT)...or, to be more specific, I'm slowly begin to be scared that I was a fan. I'm not one of those who cried when Mike Portnoy left the band. I knew that they will get another technicaly perfect drummer and they did. For me music is not about personalities but about quality of music itself, so when some member of a band left the band I never worry too much. But! Strangely (or not) music of DT \"dramaticaly\" changed after Portnoy's departure. Dramatical Turn of Events was blank - first time it happened that DT released an album with no really outstanding song. Next album, selftitled one, was in my eyes even blanker, music became really boring, man could literally feel that the band was loosing inspiration and I admit, that I don't remember more than 2 songs from that album. At that time I really began to worry about what was happening. And then it came...a disastreous experiment that we all hope it won't happen again. \n\nFrom perspective above it must be said that Distance Over Time is a turn in right direction. DT again released an album that can be called prog metal. It is a solid album. It has all the ingredients every DT album must have: musicianship on high level, heavy riffing, melodic choruses, instrumental \"wankary\"...everything is again here. Where's then the problem? The main problem stays in lack of inspiration. Everything on this album was heard many times before, music is simply chewed and predictable. It is not as boring as it is their selftitled album, but there is still no serious progress regarding songwritting. It looks like the band is trapped in a cage of their own ideas that have been used hundreds of times before and that they're no longer capable to offer anything new and fresh. \n\nAll mentioned above was already indicated by the first single that came out - album opener Untethered Angel. A classical DT song, with nice accoustic intro, followed by solid palmmutted distorted riff, but then developing into totaly cheesy chorus. A song would have been good 15 years ago, but now it sounds boring. Satisfaction then slightly elevates second track Paralysed with interesting slow intro that developes into heavy openstring riff, followed by beautiful palmmutted prog riff. Hope for a better album rises, but unfortunately only during this song. In the sequel, the album again falls into the predictable structures of the songs, resulting in album which is, as a whole, quite boring. Most of the songs would be, by the standards set with earlier DT albums, mediocre fillers. \n\nHowever, there are of course some good tracks. Besides already mentioned second track Paralysed, tracks that also deserve to be mentioned are Room 137 - the most agressive song on the album, short and effective, with massive riffing and strange dark lyrics; Pale Blue Dot - with its 8+ minutes longest track of the album opens with classic DT media sounding intro, which developes into heavy progressive guitar riffing in almost Sympkony X's style, where Jordan also shows, who's the master, maybe the best song and only track that deserve to find itself on some of the preMangini era albums; Viper King - closing track, commercial radio-frendly song, amost more hardrock than prog song, but it has some kind of soul and it is, because of that, more memorable than any other track on the album.\n\nGood sides of the album must also be highlighted. As mentioned above, songs contain everything a DT fan expects from a band. Technicaly the band is on their wellknown level - masterful as always, the production is also clear as sharp as always expected. The album is better and more diverse than self-titled one, but on the other side worse than Dramatical Turn of Events (its predecessor is not worth mentioning here). \n\nIf we weren't talking about DT, the album would probably have earned a higher rating, but here's the progressive metal kings we are talking about. The band with several genre-defining masterpieces in a row under it's belt and from the band of such quality only the best is always expected. But sadly, even after this one, waiting for a new masterpiece continues. The whole album lacks identity. Here we are faced with obvious and severe lack of inspiration, there is for a maximum 3 or 4 tracks of good material. It seems that it is a time for DT to take some longer time off and try to find the stuning inspiration they once had...if there is still some left. I really and honestly hope they will manage to find it.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s incredible to think that Dream Theater are 31 years old this year and still making challenging, technical music. Their prime era in the \u201990s led the charge for a second wave of progressive metal and, though some purists may disagree, their more recent output has stretched their own boundaries as musicians and artists.\n\n2016\u2019s The Astonishing was a sprawling, ambitious concept album, rich in proggy nutrients and filled to the brim with imagery. Whilst it divided fans more than any previous work, it was a bold leap for the band. Distance Over Time, however, is more focused on the songs than the theme, trimming away all the gristle and tinsel to reveal the band\u2019s strongest album in over a decade. Songs like \u2018Barstool Warrior\u2019 and the epic \u2018At Wit\u2019s End\u2019 are everything that a long-time fan could ask for \u2013 heavy, intricate, huge, and sublime. Mike Mangini has finally come into his own on the drumstool, allowing the strings, keys, and vocals to breathe when they need to and then putting his own stamp on the areas that require it. James LaBrie has honestly never sounded better on the mic and leaves every ounce of his talent all over the record. Meanwhile, John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess continue to astound with their guitar/keys interplay, solos, and leads that warm the ears, and John Myung\u2026 well, John is John \u2013 solid, ridiculously talented, and the true heart of the band with that bass in his hands.\n\nIs it the best Dream Theater album ever? No, but that\u2019s not knocking this collection of songs as they have never put out a bad one. Is it in their top five? Yeah, quite possibly. We\u2019re now looking at a band that has finally come out from the Portnoy shadow and is an entirely independent entity. Even as a major fanboy, this writer approached it as if he had never heard the band before to find the true value (not easy), and was truly blown away by everything that Distance Over Time contains. There might be another great album this year, but for now this may be the pick of 2019. \n\nOriginally written for astralnoizeuk.com - https://astralnoizeuk.com/2019/03/22/review-dream-theater-distance-over-time/\n",
        "\nSure, the title may seem lucrative to some people, but then again I couldn't care any less. God of War: Blood & Metal is a six-track split from the game God of War 3 that features three metalcore bands (with other essences of their own): Killswitch Engage, Trivium, and Munity Within and three standard to progressive metal bands: Dream Theater, Taking Dawn, and Opeth. Additionally, although not available, there's a bonus track called Even Gods Cry by The Turtlenecks, which are just folk and their song is over seven minutes. Since that song and the band aren't available on this split, there's no point in mentioning them at all. First I'll talk about the metalcore songs and then I'll talk about the songs which others might like more, the traditional/progressive stuff.\n\nMy Obsession by Killswitch Engage is everything their self-retitled album from 2009 should've sounded. Not only this song specifically belongs to that album, yet it's too damn good that it was missed back then, and perhaps would've made said album better. Howard's screaming is unbelievably crushing, as well as his clean vocals. The guitars sound heavy and destructive with their pitched harmonics, not to mention them blazing melodies. With every passing second, the song sounds better and better. The bridge is atmospheric, which shows the band still had some originality. I guess this is truly a goodbye song from Howard or a departure-one last song with the band.\n\nShattering the Skies Above by Trivium was originally released on this very split album, though it was also released as a single with the band's cover of Sepultura's Slave New World and later as a bonus track on their fifth full-length, In Waves. Pretty impressed for a first impression, although I've had listened to two songs from Silence in the Snow that I liked, the music isn't that bad. It kinda varies between metalcore to the thrash metal essence. The blast beats are probably my favorite part about this song. And obviously, this is another pretty melodic band.\n\nThe End by Mutiny Within was surprisingly decent. This is one of those progressive metalcore bands that in this particular song feature some light symphonies to strengthen the atmosphere. While it sounds decent, it also sounds very mainstream; probably as mainstream as people might find this song on them shitty AMV (anime music video) YouTube videos. Averagely decent with some layers.\n\nRaw Dog by Dream Theater is a long, progressive instrumental track, and much like the song from Trivium this follows the same principle when it comes to its release date (though not available as a bonus track on any form). The song has a nice start, with its heavy - although quite djenty riffage, as the track progresses into a synthesized atmosphere. Though after that nice intro and progression, the track became more groovy and symphonic, which there I stopped caring. Then again, having to listen to a repetitive, seven-minute instrumental progressive track would be very annoying to go through and I'm glad I had to do this only once.\n\nThis Is Madness by Taking Dawn is standard metal song, although its guitars are very melodic with some power metal essence. It's got a fine guitar solo, but overall it's a generic metal song from a generic modern metal band. I honestly don't know what else to say other than being generic and also repetitive.\n\nThroat of Winter by Opeth, which is also available as a single in a vinyl form, is not that bad. The acoustic guitars sound amazing, while the song's progression becomes more synthesized and atmospheric. Pretty weird first impression since I'm a death metal fan and opted for something of that kind, but instead you get an acoustic song, which again wasn't that bad. At the same time, it doesn't belong here since I figured this split/EP was meant for whatever metal genre.\n\nNow for the ratings: My Obsession - magnificent! At a loss for words for this one. 100% Shattering the Skies Above will settle on 75%. I bet Trivium's music is great but, of course, to some extent. The End was, again, pretty mainstream and accessible. Didn't find anything original, but still an alright song. 60%. Raw Dog's best parts, which are unfortunately a repeat, are the intro and outro. 30%. This Is Madness makes me feel bad about modern metal music - but that song SUCKED. 0%. Throat of Winter, again, while it didn't belong to this album it was still not a bad song. 70%. Best songs are My Obsession, Shattering the Skies Above, and Throat of Winter.\n",
        "\nEven though I don\u2019t listen to much Dream Theater anymore, they are one of THE most important bands in my musical development, or more specifically this album. Prior to this album I only listened to nu, alt, and thrash metal, and I stumbled across this band while watching a watchmojo video on YouTube. When I sat down and listened to a few full songs from Dream Theater, I was completely blown away by the songwriting prowess demonstrated in their music, more so than ever before. Images and Words showcases some of the most well thought out and cohesive pieces of music that I have ever heard.\n\nThe guitarwork on this album alone is mind blowing. From the clean melodic intro to \u201cPull me Under\u201d to the fun and rhythmically complex riffs present on basically every song to the amazing solos, every note John Petrucci plays on this record serves a purpose and evokes some sort of emotional response. The guitar tone is also perfect for a progressive metal record like this. Almost every riff on this record is memorable and unique from the others, and the same can be said about every melodic lead.\n\nThe rhythm section on this album is phenomenal. Absolutely crazy drum grooves throughout the whole album and insane fills. Mike Portnoy is one of the most highly praised drummers in the metal community, and for good reason. Sometimes the drums will just go off along with Petrucci\u2019s guitarwork creating some of the most rhythmically mind boggling sections that then transition to something new before you even know what hit you. The bass is also phenomenal, often doing more than just mimicking the guitars, though it is sometimes hard to make out as it can be buried in the noise of the guitars, drums, and keyboards.\n\nSpeaking of keyboards, they are one of the highlights of the album. They often deliver tasteful solos and leads delivering an abundance of melody and another layer of complexity. The song \u201cWait for Sleep\u201d is centered around the keyboards, making that song, in my opinion, a Dream Theater classic despite not being one of the long epic songs that Dream Theater s known for.\n\nThe vocal performance here is far better than any other vocal performance that I have heard from Labrie. Just listen to the verses on Metropolis Pt 1 for some of the most epic and emotional clean singing you\u2019ll ever hear. Other vocal highlights include his vocals on \u201cPull me Under\u201d and the softer vocals on \u201cWait for Sleep\u201d.\n\nAll in all a beautiful emotional journey that I swear could be the soundtrack to a rollercoaster (just go to 7:00 on Metropolis Pt 1). The entire album is absolutely gushing with melody from the guitars, keys, vocals, and even bass. So many amazing transitions that feel like they shouldn\u2019t work, but they work so well. This album is complex both rhythmically and melodically, but is by no means \u201cwankery\u201d. What separates technical music like this from wankery is the sheer emotion evoked in the listener while listening. I would rate this album a 99% if it weren\u2019t for the relatively boring track \u201cAnother Day\u201d. This album is near perfect and worthy of every ounce of praise it receives.\n\nBest songs: Pull me Under, Take the Time, Metropolis Pt 1. (\u201cThe Miracle and the Sleeper\u201d), Wait for Sleep, Learning to Live\n",
        "\nBefore I begin this review, I just want to say that for a very long time, I loved this album. I thought it was one of the best Dream Theater albums and it felt like there were just too many great moments on this album to count. The truth is, though, that in between the best parts of Black Clouds and Silver Linings lies a sea of mediocrity.\n\nThe record opens with \"A Nightmare to Remember,\" a song describing a kid in a car accident. The opening riff is epic and ominous, but, again, we're describing a kid experiencing a car crash, not two armies fighting at the edge of the universe. That mismatch in tone -- melodrama and epicness coupled with a stupid narrative -- is a theme that reappears throughout the album. I suspect that at this point, the band really had nothing to write about anymore, hitting a creative wall. \"A Nightmare to Remember\" is one of four (yes, four) suites on this album, and all of them find ways to disappoint. On \"The Shattered Fortress,\" the final song of Mike Portnoy's Twelve-Step Suite, the band tries to tie up the loose ends for a project that started with \"The Glass Prison\" off 2001's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Lyrically, the song is absolute garbage -- even for Dream Theater standards. Personally, I can't quantify how much I hate the moment where James LaBrie says \"I am responsible\" with such idiotic obliviousness. I was expecting the finale of the suite to subvert some of the motifs and themes we saw across the last five Dream Theater albums; instead, it regurgitates those themes and melodies, and is incredibly boring as a result. \n\n\"The Best of Times\" describes Mike Portnoy's relationship with his dad, who, during the compositon of the album, was terminally ill. It's a touching tribute to his father, with an awesome Petrucci solo to top it off. However, it's nothing extraordinary, and it comes off more as a personal song from Mike Portnoy than as a creative effort to share with the world. As a result, it feels a bit out of place. The same can be said for the two shorter songs on the album; \"Wither\" is a ballad in the vein of 2005's \"I Walk Beside You\" or 2007's \"Forsaken;\" radio-friendly, agreeable, loud, forgettable. Speaking of forgettable, \"A Rite of Passage\" is a song that should have never been recorded. It is, in my opinion, the worst Dream Theater song written in the Mike Portnoy era. Lyrically, melodically, musically, unimpressionable, and a piece of garbage. The album ends with \"The Count of Tuscany,\" a 19-minute epic that describes a misunderstanding with an Italian dude. If the vocals weren't a factor -- and BOY do I wish they weren't -- you might think this song was describing something else enitrely. Like the opener, the melodrama of the song does not match with the idiotic, simplistic lyrics. Between the beautiful guitar work in the intro and the second half of the song lies a pretty annoying verse and anthem-like chorus that, once again, clashes with the song's narrative about John Petrucci being scared of a weird Italian guy. It doesn't help that in the pre-chorus, we once again hear Mike Portnoy rap behind James LaBrie whining through his nose. It's a god damn shame, too, since the ambient mid-section of this song is probably the best part of the album. Like I said, however, you have to wait through long, boring, mediocre swaths of music to get to the brilliance in this album.\n\nI didn't want to get in on the whole Portnoy-Mangini topic in what is supposed to be a professional-ish review, but I can't shake the feeling that this album suffers mainly because Mike Portnoy's hands are all over it. He tries too hard on the longer suites and possesses way too much of an influence over this album. I could see why he would feel burnt out after this, especially because for the most part it's a pretty uninspiring record. I remember at my local radio station, finding a copy of this with a note from a DJ to \"play the longer stuff, ignore the rest\" and I think that's a fair assessment of the album as a whole. Beside the first and last track, the album is somewhat forgettable to me. I know a lot of Dream Theater fans love this album, but I think it could have been a lot better if the band took a break. Dream Theater, after all, never struggles with making complex or emotional music -- most recently, they've continued to suffer from uninspiring writing and poor narrative ideas. This will take a life of its own on their self-titled record and on The Astonishing, but my point is that this album shows those symptoms blatantly, and is disappointing as a result.\n",
        "\nDream Theater's Systemic Chaos is notable in that it definitively signals the beginning of the band's decline in musical quality. While there are moments of brilliance on this record, it possesses as many average and even a few moribund moments that dilute whatever could have made this album so good.\n\nSo let's get right into it, then; easily the best part of this album are the opening and closing tracks, which together make up the 26-minute long epic suite \"In the Presence of Enemies.\" This suite marks, in my opinion, one of the high points of the band's entire career; most progressive metal bands would give their souls to the devil for the chance to craft a sophisticated and engaging prog suite like this one. While most of the album deals with \"dark\" (if not comically and stupidly dark) material, this is probably the only song that transcends what would otherwise be a cliche and boring narrative, one inspired by the Korean comic \"Priest.\" Opening right out of the gates with an epic guitar riff and seamlessly transitioning from complex riffage to beautiful guitar passages to clean percussion and guitar interplay to ambience and literally everything in between. It's ultimately a showcase of every band member's talents -- even James LaBrie, whose vocal performance is markedly weaker from 2003's Train of Thought and 2005's Octavarium, manages to sound incredible, in part because he almost never goes for a high note. The lyrics are also surprisingly strong for a Dream Theater song. All together, it's one of the best songs the band has ever written, and it's the song that serves as golden wrapping paper for an otherwise shoddy record.\n\nThe rest of the songs on this album are ... well ... pretty garbage. \"Constant Motion\" has a jaw-dropping guitar solo and some pretty cool riffs, and \"The Dark Eternal Night,\" while otherwise a stupid song in terms of lyrics, is really fun to bang your head to. Other than a few moments on those songs, the writing is extremely forgettable and formulaic. \"Forsaken,\" a song about a guy who falls in love with a vampire or something like that, follows the radio friendly ballad formula that worked so poorly on 2005's Octavarium, with a simple chord progression and song structure, terribly bland and uninspiring lyrics, and a Petrucci guitar solo to keep things a little interesting. \"Prophets of War\" is the political song that literally no one asked Dream Theater to write. It's a half-assed rebuttal of the Iraq War, but Dream Theater lacks the sophistication or the interest to really dive into important political topics, and as a result it's a weak and forgettable song. The most memorable moment is probably when Mike Portnoy decides to rap in the middle, which is why I tend to skip this song. \"The Ministry of Lost Souls\" is probably 10 minutes too long. Although it has some gorgeous guitar work, it's a very repetitive song that plods its way through nearly its entire duration. \n\nMike Portnoy delivers the penultimate song of his Twelve-Step Suite with \"Repentance.\" It's a change of pace both in his Twelve-Step Suite and in this album, and doesn't really fit into either melodically. It regurgitates some of the motifs in the earlier parts of the suites with clean guitars and quiet drumming, and then, interspersed with some Opeth-like keyboards, some big names in metal deliver some spoken word poetry, or something like that. It's a cute touch for a song that's pretty freaking boring, and maybe the only reason to listen to it at all is to hear some of your favorite musicians apologize for their problems with addiction. In fact, I think \"Repentance\" is a symbol for the album as a whole -- pretentious, somewhat harmless, lacking substance, and full of wasted potential. \n\nI'm being a bit hard on this album only because it had the potential to be one of the best Dream Theater albums ever. Even the cover art is lame. Aside from John Petrucci, who is consistently great on this record, and from the band's collective performance on \"In the Presence of Enemies,\" the band delivers acceptable and agreeable performances that could have been so much more. Jordan Rudess, for example, mainly doubles the guitar work on his leads, or provides a synth background, much like he did on 2003's Train of Thought. But where ToT actually delivered on its heavy material, this album falls flat when it tries to discuss heavier subject matter, and that is why it fails. John Myung is a bit louder than usual on this album, and Mike Portnoy is -- for better or, in most cases, for worse -- more involved on vocals and in peppering songs with drum fills, but there's still so much left to be desired from this album. For an album that's 78 minutes long, that's just not acceptable.\n",
        "\nDistance over Time is a record I enjoyed much more than I expected to. While it's far from perfect, it's one of the most consistently satisfying album in Dream Theater's discography and a significant step in the right direction from the last two albums. \n\nThe album opens with what is, in my opinion, one of the strongest songs they've ever wriiten -- Untethered Angel. From its beautiful opening progression to the extremely catchy chorus to the matured and crafty guitar work (a recurring feature of this album), it's a song I've played again and again since the album was released. The two songs after, Paralyzed and Fall into the Light, are solid, albeit derivative, metal songs. Paralyzed sounds very similar to Breaking Benjamin's \"Diary of Jane\" and Fall Into the Light has sections that are very Metallica-esque. I find the middle of the album to be a bit boring -- the jamming on S2N, for example, gets repetitive quickly. Barstool Warrior is a song that the band has been trying to write for a long time; while the lyrical premise is pretty stupid, it's actually a pretty and melodic song, and one of the strongest on the record. \n\nHowever, the highlight of the album, to me, is At Wit's End. Clocking in at over nine minutes, it's the longest song on the album, and easily captures all of its strong points. All of the band members (except LaBrie -- who I will get to in a minute) fire on all cylinders; John Petrucci puts together one of his most powerful guitar performances from the intro to the outro solo, Myung and Rudess get in on most of the action with subtle instrumentalism, and Mike Mangini, as he does throughout the album, mesmerizes with crafty and creative drum patterns on a song that is oddly topical, discussing the aftershock of a woman who gets sexually assaulted. Out of Reach is one of the best ballads Dream Theater has ever recorded, in my opinion, and it's a great song to lip sync to in the shower. Many Dream Theater fans will love Pale Blue Dot, perhaps the only song that can be described as an \"epic\" on the album. I personally hate it, as I think it has some of the most awkward riffs and melodies in their entire discography. Mangini puts a hell of a lot of work into the intro though. \n\nThe weakest link on the entire album, in my opinion, is James LaBrie. His voice is very obviously and egregiously processed with effects and pitch correction, and this is most apparent in Viper King, the \"bonus track\" where his voice is so muddy with effects that it's impossible to hear what he's saying. Throughout the album though, his performance is weak, carried by effects. He even borrows melodies from old Dream Theater songs -- the outro to At Wit's End, for example, has him singing a melody that can be heard in Metropolis Part 2. It's getting more and more apparent that he just can't do this gig anymore, and I think this album might be the last decent perfomance we will get from him. As I've said throughout the review, though, the other members play with a vigor that hasn't been heard in a decade. John Petrucci continues to show us all why he's the godfather of modern metal guitar, and the other band members provide an energy and creativity that make this album, in my opinion, one of the better records in the band's discography.\n\nDistance over Time contains some of the best songwriting the band has ever shown and some of the most bland and unoriginal performances of their entire career; still, the good far outweighs the bad, and overall it's a solid and fun listen. As the band moves further into its lifetime, it's encouraging to see a release like this one, and it's clear they've still got some juice left in the tank, even if they're using less of it than they should be.\n",
        "\nI have been a fan of DT since Train of Thought. What got me into this band was originally Mike Portnoy, so seeing him leave was disastrous to me. That was until I realized who took over. I was fan of Mangini long before Portnoy or Dream Theater was ever a part of my musical library. Having said that, the change from Mike 1 to Mike 2 was not without consequence. \n\nThe dynamic of the band was shattered in my opinion. That was only proven by the heavy rhythm driven sound that dominated their 2011 release A Dramatic Turn of Events. You can tell it was written with a drummer absent. The album was not objectively bad, but the stark contrast to previous releases was apparent. When their self titled album came out, you could tell they were in trouble. With all the members on board writing, what could\u2019ve been a promising representation of the chemistry of the new line-up tuned out to be an ambitious and next-to-directionless release. The Astonishing was not much better, and being only written mainly by Petrucci and Rudess, there was no way of telling if this album was a genuine reflection of the entire band. On top of that, the already shaky fanbase did not know how to digest this 2 \u00bd hour monstrosity. \n\nCue Distance Over Time. This album seemed like a breath of fresh air after walking through an abandoned slaughter house on a hot day. It was no secret that the band went into this album with all members on board and actively involved in the writing process. Even James sat in to give his input where needed. On top of that, we got to hear a song that had lyrics written by Mangini. The album is a beautiful expression of the completeness of the post-Portnoy lineup. All the members shine on this album. The singles did a great job at getting the hype of the album without giving away too much. \u201cUntethered Angel\u201d and \u201cParalyzed\u201d are worthy of being added to the list of amazing singles like \u201cThe Looking Glass,\u201d \u201cForsaken\u201d and \u201cThe Gift of Music.\u201d While \u201cFall into the Light\u201d does a perfect job of encompassing the DT sound in a smaller song format. \u201cBarstool Warrior\u201d and \u201cS2N\u201d are perfected versions of what I would consider DT\u2019s format of making a prog rock song that has a more pop dominated chorus. This is something that I felt was introduced on their self-titled album with the songs \u201cBehind the Veil,\u201d \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d and \u201cSurrender to Reason,\u201d but is better represented on this album. Tackling the two epics together, \u201cAt Wits End\u201d is everything we would expect a DT epic to be. It comes in with an onslaught of progressive mastery, has a killer instrumental section that is complimented by a strong vocal performance by James. \u201cPale Blue Dot\u201d is one of the only problems I have with this album. It felt like it was an entire song full of riffs that never really lead to anything. I was always expecting more right up until the end of the song. \u201cOut of reach,\u201d I can take it or leave it. I don\u2019t really find James\u2019s voice that captivating anymore, so to have a song that is vocal led seems uninteresting to me. The bonus song, \u201cViper King,\u201d was just fun. And it is great to see the guys having this much fun on an album. Not too much to say there. It was just a good fun song and an enjoyable way to wrap up the album.\t\n\nAs for the production side of the album, I love that they went with a more stripped-down approach. Their previous two releases have been torn to shreds by people critical of overproduction. This album gives us the DT sounds in the purest form possible and that just adds to the genuine enjoyment of the album for me. Plus, the room is given to Myung to be heard for once. It is also the first album to feature a drum sound (post-Portnoy) that did not want me to stab my ears out. Mangini\u2019s kit sounds great. It has a lot of punch, and fits in the mix very well. Jordan went with pretty much all Hammond sounds on this album and I approve that 100%. It adds to the simpler feel of the album. James\u2019 voice turned out to be well mixed as well. With the first single being \u201cUntethered Angel,\u201d I was worried about what they did with his voice. It seemed to be lost in the mix for most of the song. Thankfully this is not something that continues past the first song. I was relatively unimpressed with John this time around. Excellent rhythm and melodies from him, but his solos were bland and uninteresting for the most part. \n\nThis album is not without sins. As mentioned already, \u201cPale Blue Dot\u201d was underwhelming. It may have the elements of a DT epic, but the structure of the song as well as the execution of the song makes it fall short of even lesser epics such as \u201cSacrificed Sons,\u201d \u201cTrial of Tears,\u201d and \u201cEndless Scarface.\u201d Another song that has not been mentioned too much is Room 137. It was mid rate and clunky. Sure, we got some lyrics from Mangini, and those I have no problem with, it\u2019s just wasted on what I would consider the worst song on the album. \n\nDream Theater had entered proving grounds after Mike left, and I consider them fully out of it. Distance Over Time is a concise and accurate representation of what the band has become. Is it worthy of being placed on top of the DT discography? No. Is it worthy of praise? Hell yes! We have been given what I would consider a promise to fans. The DT we love is still alive and well. They are back on track and have shown us what world-class musicians can really do when the musical chemistry is strong. \nHighlights: \n\n-\tFall into The Light\n-\tBarstool Warrior\n-\tS2N\n-\tAt Wits End\n",
        "\nI haven't really been following Dream Theater all that much recently. I was really into them last year; I had just discovered Metropolis Pt, 2: Scenes From a Memory and I couldn't stop listening to that record. It was like a video game OST meets metal (and not that \"UNDERTALE MEGALOVANIA METAL COVER!\" stuff) Dream Theater does prog right. Anyway, I left them alone for a while and what do you know, they just released an album! I was beyond relieved to hear that it wasn't a concept album. Don't get me wrong, they are usually great, but it's kind of a hit or miss thing. Metropolis, Pt 2: Scenes From A Memory is an example of a great concept album. While I haven't given The Astonishing enough time, it seemed to sacrifice its music for the story. That's the thing about concept albums; they are entirely based around the story. The album's sound mirrors the plot. You have to be sure you have a solid and \"concept album\" worthy story or else you'll just end up with an hour and a half of generic ballads, or something. What I'm trying to say is that it's nice to see Dream Theater release a collection of standalone songs again.\n\nNow, the very first thing I noticed when listening to Distance Over Time was the production. The album sounds great. I'm not saying that Dream Theater have poorly mixed albums, not at all. I'm saying that I've been listening to first-wave black metal for the past week and its nice to hear the music fill your headphones for a change. The very next thing I noticed was that the \"heaviness\" was back. Low and groovy riffs can be found throughout the album and some songs are based entirely around them. Forgive my flawed knowledge of Dream Theater's discography, but this is something I haven't really heard since Systematic Chaos. I've never really been a fan; I prefer the band's softer, chord emphasized songs. All of the \"heavier\" riffs sound like they were torn from the first few bars of a Breaking Benjamin song. It's not my thing, however I was more than happy to hear that typical Dream Theater sound throughout the record. The complex chords, alien atmosphere and 1980s vibe are still very much present from start to finish and the melodies are awesome! Also, the keyboard work is well done and used appropriately. It isn't overdone; it comes in exactly when it's needed and adds an almost magical touch to the songs. It's nothing new or groundbreaking, but any fan should be happy to hear that the typical Dream Theater sound is still there. I'm just not too big on the alternative metal influences.\n\nThe longer tracks don't drag on in the slightest. In fact, they are a huge factor to what makes the album great. Why? Those goddamn middle passages! Around halfway through every long song, the band slows down and blesses our ears with beautiful, complex and awe-inspiring chords. This is the Dream Theater I signed up for and I was more than happy to find these wonderful passages placed throughout. You really have to stop and admire their talent and these breaks allow you to do that. Occasionally, the shorter songs will do this as well. They'll stop the song and throw in an atmospheric melody to free you from the rhythm and wake you up a little. The album is constantly experimenting with different sounds and vibes and are (literally) thrown in every now and then. Looking back at the notes I wrote down while listening to the record, \"beautiful middle passages\" and \"great atmosphere\" pop up the most. There is no doubt about that. \n\nThere is a slower song entitled \"Out of Reach\" near the end. To be honest, it is the only real downside to the album. After all that, we're given a pretty bland ballad that tries to emulate the feel of those middle passages I mentioned. It's forgettable. Finally, we are treated to Pale Blue Dot, the closing track. This song uses some pretty evil chords and gives the song a sort of badass feel. Unlike the previous long songs, this one's middle passage isn't beautiful and awe-inspiring, it's chaotic and all over the place! This part reminds me of Metropolis, Pt 1: [\"The Miracle and The Sleeper\"] and its chaotic middle passage. Every Dream Theater album needs this sort of thing and Distance Over Time does not disappoint.\n\nOverall, it's a great record. I wish I had kept up with it prior to its release as I would have been treated to three of those nine amazing songs earlier. I mentioned before how it wasn't a concept album. Having listened to the album more than a few times now, I can say that even without characters and plot twists (or even a plot...), Distance Over Time feels more like a concept album. Its atmosphere, variety and mood tell a unique tale that wouldn't work in the form of a two hour epic. While The Astonishing sacrificed its music for the story, Distance Over Time's music is the story.\n",
        "\nThree years after the calm conceptual double-album The Astonishing, Dream Theater has released its fourteenth studio record in form of Distance over Time. The American progressive metal quintet has kept certain elements of its controversial predecessor but also moves boldly into a complete new direction it hasn't explored so far. The new record might be perceived controversially by critics and fans alike because it dares to flirt with new soundscapes but it never loses the band's essential identity based around the contrast between soothing emotions and technical ecstasy.\n\nDistance over Time has kept numerous calm moments from the predecessor in form of airy guitar sounds, soft keyboard layers and soothing vocals that work well in the calmer moments of the concise ''Paralyzed'' and the atmospheric epic ''At Wit's End'' to give two specific examples. The new record has also kept the concise song writing of its predecessor as most tracks are rather short by the band's progressive metal standards and get to the point without neglecting ambitious musicianship. Bonus track ''Viper King'' might be the best song in that regard as it mixes progressive rock organ sounds from the seventies with contemporary technical metal riffs that are hold together by an energetic, liberating and skilled performance by James LaBrie whose vocals give the song a gripping and memorable note. This song shouldn't have been a bonus track but rather the first single of this album as it underlines the fact that the band still has numerous fresh ideas to incorporate in its sound.\n\nOn the other side, the song writing process behind Distance over Time has reinforced the quintet's spontaneous side as most tracks sound like jam sessions. While this approach lacks fluidity at first contact and needs some time to grow, it makes the song material genuinely progressive and surprising. The vivid bass guitar play and extraordinary guitar solo in the unpredictable ''S2N'' are instant highlights just like the ambitious science-fiction soundtrack ''Pale Blue Dot'' that comes around with an unpredictable instrumental section that sounds like Ayreon on ecstasy. One element fans might criticize is the unusually domineering use of vocal effects that give James LaBrie's voice a robotic and futuristic touch. The floating album opener and first single ''Untethered Angel'' uses this stylistic device right from the start, has already been met with mixed reactions and is only the starting point for vocal experimentation throughout the entire album. These effects might sound confusing at first contact but end up becoming a coherent guideline throughout a modern record that pushes the boundaries. Those who miss James LaBrie's soothing clean vocals can listen to the past twelve records while those who have always wanted him to experiment more with his vocals should feel excited about this new courageous direction.\n\nDream Theater has managed to find an intriguing balance between more emotional ballad sequences and more synthetic modern progressive metal jam sessions that give this album a very broad stylistic spectre but also a quite unique identity. It's great to see that the world's most important progressive metal band doesn't sit on its laurels but tries pushing the boundaries. This attitude deserves respect, no matter whether you like the final result or not. Distance over Time is a lot better than the fluffy predecessor and the unfocused self-titled effort and the band's best effort since the airy, epic and imaginative A Dramatic Turn of Events almost eight years earlier. This isn't the band's greatest hour but a good average effort by the band's standards, a genuine relief after its last two albums and a very good progressive metal release with two outstanding career highlights in form of the spontaneous ''S2N'' and the concise 'Viper King'' that represent the record's two sides of the same medal accurately. If you think Dream Theater plays vanilla metal and has become too predictable, open your mind and your ears and enjoy this creative return to form.\n",
        "\nAs a progressive metal fan, having only heard \"Images and Words\" as a full album out from the whole Dream Theater catalog is probably my biggest cultural gap. I have however listened to individual songs from different points in their discography and have grown quite familiar with their style. Now, with their 14th full-length release \"Distance over Time\", these titans of prog bring another high quality piece of true artistry to the ears of their big and dedicated fan-base and I've got a feeling that this one is really going to get a good reception. It's certainly not their best work and it doesn't have that DNA of an epic journey associated to some of their previous songs like \"A Change of Seasons\", \"Octavarium\" or some songs from \"Metropolis part 2\" but it also doesn't seem intended that way. With the more casual song lengths and a pretty accessible vibe, it seems like they left aside the idea of epic stories and ground-breaking progressive creativity and decided to just focus on the music itself. It feels easy, or at least that's the way I perceive it.\n\nThis does not in any way mean that their new album is not impressive or that they neglected the progressive side of their music. Only that's not the the main focus. I've got a feeling that in this album they just tried to balance things out and make it work on a compositional level. Every detail seems added for a reason and the music just gives this natural feeling that everything makes sense. But all that makes Dream Theater awesome is still here. There should be no need to mention that the technicality is through the roof. That's just stating facts when it comes to this band. The guitar and keyboard solos demonstrate the superhuman status of John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess just as they probably did on every single record they released. Mike Mangini also has a lot of stand out moments where he shows off his skills and I have to say I really enjoy his work all the way through this record. Yeah I know he's not Portnoy and some people will probably still complain about that but he is what you get and he is a phenomenal drummer nonetheless. And the bass really is a big part of what gives this album's character as Myung's skills aren't used so much to flash out as they are used to get the grooves going and really make you feel the music. Somehow, I feel like it's not the technical parts themselves that stand out but the way they are embedded in the structure of the music to really add to the experience and make the songs better. Especially in the guitar solos I can't help but notice what a good dynamic is given when those blistering shreds are alternated with really soulful playing to actually elevate the sound and make it somehow bigger. \n\nThe album is also pretty diverse and offers an extensive array of emotions and different compositional directions. Some songs feel focused a lot on the feeling like \"Barstool Warrior\" and \"Out of Reach\" where it is the melody that takes the fore-front and a lot of love is given to the keyboard. James Labrie's clean and pretty expressive voice is also best used here. Other songs are heavier, more dynamic and very groovy (S2N is probably the most dynamic song on the record and does serious justice to the bass lines). While the album really is very heavy on many occasions, it never seems aggressive, the depth of the sound being more focused on the groove and on giving that satisfying oomph that you just feel in your gut and gets your neck moving. There are also the longer songs (\"At Wit's End\" and \"Pale Blue Dot\") that are a great mixture between all the various elements. And I just have to mention the progressive break in the middle of \"Pale Blue Dot\" as the highlight of the album for me personally.\n\nAcross the record there's really a certain vibe taking form. With the lyrics touching some pretty dark and slightly introspective themes but also shining some light and giving a feeling of hope, the album really comes alive and delivers a few lines and ideas that I think many people can relate to. It feels a bit sad but also motivational on some level and because of the cohesive, natural and really soulful music it actually becomes pretty relaxing while also being intellectually satisfying, courtesy of the brilliant progressive intricacies. \"It's just music\" is a line that came to my mind more than once listening to this record because that really is the purpose of it. While it is complex, original and diverse, in the end it just feels like something you play to feel good. It's not flamboyant or overly pretentious in any way and just goes back to the basics of making music for the pleasure of it. And that is something that really escaped the view of some artists and hasn't been exactly top priority in the current music business so I can only respect this release.\n",
        "\nDream Theater albums have always served as expansions or contrasts to their predecessors (See the heavy-light alternations that dominated their Portnoy eras). Distance Over Time is a rare case of an album that serves as an explicit response to the one before it. There\u2019s no way in hell that the band going back to a heavier sound and the shortest runtime since 1992\u2019s Images and Words didn\u2019t have anything to do with the bloated, ballad-friendly train wreck that became known as The Astonishing for all the wrong reasons. Alas, Dream Theater may be back with an apology letter in hand, but it is accepted with a reluctant sigh.\n\nFor the most part, the band dynamic is solid. Guitarist John Petrucci dominates proceedings with his darkest, heaviest tone since Black Clouds & Silver Linings and bassist John Myung provides a prominently murky presence throughout, even getting extended flexes on the alt-tinged \u201cS2N.\u201d Inversely, keyboardist Jordan Rudess puts in one of his most subtle performances with the band and Mike Mangini\u2019s drumming is as busy as ever, though not hitting quite as hard as one would expect with this more aggressive direction. It\u2019s still strong overall, but for the first time since the turnover, I found myself wondering how this material would\u2019ve sounded with Mike Portnoy back behind the kit.\n\nThe vocals are predictably as divisive as ever. Thankfully James LaBrie sticks to his mid-range, largely avoiding the wailing that has turned recent gigs into exercises of existential horror, but one can still hear minor touch-ups and effects supporting his voice. It\u2019s serviceable enough, but it comes off as monotonous and strained when the lines being sung aren\u2019t all that catchy or engaging. The worst may be kept at bay, but it still lurks just beneath the surface.\n\nAnd with that, the songwriting feels rather pedestrian by Dream Theater standards. Much like their 2013 self-titled album, the songs all seem to be in perpetual \u2018almost there\u2019 territory. I can appreciate the rhythmically challenging \u201cRoom 137\u201d and \u201cS2N\u201d along with the more ambitious scopes on \u201cAt Wit\u2019s End\u201d and \u201cPale Blue Dot,\u201d but none of these tracks go into true noteworthy status. There\u2019s nothing offensively bad and I can even get into \u201cParalyzed\u201d and \u201cFall into the Light\u201d with proper digestion, but this shorter runtime shouldn\u2019t feel like an act of mercy.\n\nOverall, Distance Over Time is basically a heavier version of Dream Theater\u2019s 2013 self-titled album. Both efforts are decent in themselves and well-grounded compared to the disaster they bookend but ultimately unimpressive compared to the band\u2019s best. The band isn\u2019t necessarily playing it safe aside from maybe LaBrie, but the atmosphere is very workmanlike overall.\n\nConsidering how their last attempt at experimentation went, it\u2019s difficult to tell where the band can go from here. I\u2019m still not clamoring for a Portnoy reunion but rather yearning for the optimistic spirit that made A Dramatic Turn of Events so enjoyable in 2011. This is enjoyable enough and more forgiving fans will love it, but I get the feeling that Dream Theater could be stuck on this plateau for the rest of their career.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cParalyzed\u201d\n\u201cFall into the Light\u201d\n\u201cAt Wit\u2019s End\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nDream Theater is back with a bang in their fourteenth full-length release, Distance over Time. This is easily their best album since the near-masterpiece of Black Clouds & Silver Linings back in 2009. While it doesn\u2019t break a whole lot of new ground, there\u2019s nothing within it that\u2019s distractingly derivative and it\u2019s not overly predictable. Each song is refined, organized, and extremely fluid, especially compared to the borderline mess that was The Astonishing. That being said, there\u2019s no shortage of ridiculous time changes and their iconic, choppy beats.\n\nAs usual, the musicians are so immensely talented that it\u2019s almost not even worth mentioning. John Petrucci emits serious riff power, especially evident in the intro in \u2018At Witts End\u2019 and throughout \u2018Room 137\u2032, and his and Jordan Rudess\u2019 solos are as facemelting as ever. Drummer Mike Mangini has been around for a few albums now, replacing Portnoy in 2011, and his cohesion with the rest of the band doesn\u2019t go unnoticed.\n\nThere are some really phenomenal tracks on this album. 'S2N' kicks off with a thick slapping bass line before Petrucci\u2019s funky riffage and kickass instrumentals ensue. The oozing keyboard solo at the end is my favourite on the entire album, too. (Also, did you catch that Owen Wilson sample hidden in the background?) \u2018Pale Blue Dot\u2019 is Dream Theater tried and true. It features plenty different heavily-syncopated grooves, the time changes are all over the fucking place, and the dynamic solos within are nothing short of masterful. There\u2019re big and beefy riffs and rhythm licks that make the song an absolute blast. The bluesy \u2018Viper King\u2019 is the metal shuffle to end all metal shuffles. It\u2019s not overblown and stays far away from becoming absurd, with serious keyboard solos and a super catchy hook.\n\nDream Theater\u2019s prog switch has been noticeably dialed down in the past ten or so years, and, as a result, much of the music has suffered. The age of fifty-fucking-time-changes-per-song has been over for some time, but there has been nothing to counteract the loss of such a prominent characteristic. This combined with the darker-leaning trend that began years ago has steadily weakened them at their core. However, as if containing years\u2019 worth of sincerity and energy, Distance over Time regains all of their velocity and reasserts their place as the prog kings.\n\nOriginally written for powerthorn.com\n",
        "\nWhere to start with this song? The second single from Distance Over Time, Fall into the Light was tasked with following the palatable but underwhelming Untethered Angel. For all intents and purposes, Fall into the Light succeeded, even in places where the band has bee failing for years. Namely, in terms of the mixing and the vocals. \n\nTo point out the elephant in the room, John Myung penned the lyrics to this song for the first time in years. Having given us lyrics from Learning to Live, Fatal Tragedy, Trial of Tears, and more, expectations are always high when the soft-spoken bassist puts pen to paper. This is not his best work. For the Dream Theater fans who were looking forward to hearing Myung's deep, reflective, and distinctive writing style, it might be best to wait until the next album. There's nothing wrong with them, but they are kind of boring. Consider the chorus: \n\n\nToo much love is not enough for us\nI was once too blind to see\nToo much hope will never be enough\nIt's become so clear to me\n\n\nIt's really just not that great. I expected more from Myung, but at least he's still better at writing lyrics than John Petrucci and James LaBrie. \n\nBut I digress. The mix in this song is off the charts. The best mix Dream Theater has had on a single song since Breaking All Illusions, which was released a solid seven years ago. It should excite fans that John Myung appears to be making a resurgence in terms of both the aggressiveness and loudness of his sound. Complementing the bass is drummer Mike Mangini, whose snare drum, at long last, sounds like an actual snare drum and not someone hitting two pieces of metal together. Punchy and upfront, Mike Mangini sounds like he did twenty years ago on some of those old Annihilator, albeit still with a rather weak bass drum. I would argue that this song is his best to date with Dream Theater, and not just because of his sound: The technicality of his drumming is simply breathtaking. With incredible snare speed and hand-foot coordination being showcased before verses, intuitive and tasteful timekeeping lasting through the breakdown, and snotty fills reinforcing time signature changes, Mangini truly puts on a show. \n\nThough Myung and Mangini are the highlights, Petrucci and Ruddess also manage to display some outstanding musicianship. John Petrucci's guitar has depth and definition and brings a huge low end that contrasts nicely with the higher-octave keyboards of Jordan Ruddess. Petrucci bookends the acoustic interlude with an elastic, ethereal guitar solo that's equal parts David Gilmour and Tony MacAlpine, but Jordan Ruddess steals the show with a shred-tastic keyboard solo to end the song. \n\nFinally, there's James LaBrie. Perennially the weak link. His recent live performances have not exactly inspired confidence in his range and tone for this coming album, but he does a tolerable\u2013half-decent, actually\u2013job here. Though he's still pretty nasal, he remains somewhat in his range throughout this song, so he appears to have good pitch control for the first time this century. He's still breathy, and he still holds notes for too long, but he really does seem to have turned a corner. He's always been okay in the lower registers, so hopefully he builds on his success here and adapts. \n\nTo nitpick, this song suffers from brief and somewhat corny lyrics and a bass drum sound that isn't quite as forward as everything else in the mix. Overall, though, this song showcases what Dream Theater's strengths have always been: Technicality and creativity. So based on their excellent performance in those two areas specifically, this song easily gets a B+ grade. 89/100.\n",
        "\nWhen you're listening to an album that spans well over a full hour in duration, you want to hear content that's worth your time. Dream Theater has, with a few occasional exceptions, consistently held up to this expectation. A Dramatic Turn of Events is arguably their most recent quality album, sharing many traits with their earlier work. From the cheesy-yet-cool keyboard runs to John Petrucci's legendary solos to James LaBrie's soaring vocals, the album is a fantastic representation of what Dream Theater has to offer, or at least what they had to offer in 2011.\n\nDespite being relatively consistent throughout their career, the band has managed to retain some unpredictability with each new release. This can mainly be attributed to the extremely long songs, which all vary significantly from each other. Between dreamy quiet sections and massively distorted prog riffs, each of the four ten-plus minute songs on A Dramatic Turn of Events offers a unique and genuinely interesting listening experience. Most of the music isn't exactly progressive metal in the traditional sense of the term; the softer sections certainly reflect a major progressive influence, yet the heavier parts seem to draw more from traditional heavy metal than anything else.\n\nIn addition to those very long songs, there is a collection of shorter (but still not very short) songs that essentially serve as condensed versions of the same thing. As a nice little afterthought, \"Far from Heaven\" is a lovely, touching little piano-centered piece which is the standalone song on the album to not reach the five-minute mark.\n\nA Dramatic Turn of Events is a solid album through and through, though it lacks slightly in energy or emotion in many songs. While mostly consistent in terms of direction, only a few tracks really pop out as excellent. By combining a group of five extremely proficient musicians, Dream Theater will always stand out as one of the greatest progressive metal bands of all time - even if they don't always exactly fit that label.\n\nBest songs: \"Far from Heaven\" and especially \"Breaking All Illusions\"\n",
        "\nWhen I first head that Dt was going back into the studio as a whole unit, I was so excited to hear what would come out of it. That brings me back to albums like Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds where the musical genius was firing on all levels. Unfortunately, Untethered Angel is expectantly underwhelming. Having said that, it is a single, so I am not going to oust Distance Over Time for just the one song.\n\nIt has it's typical DT arpeggio that we have heard on way to many songs to be original. The main riff is pretty decent for a groove/nu metal riff. It seems the farther they have had to tune down for Labrie, the less melodic their riffs get. But it gets the song started. The verse chugging riff with the synth behind seems to be a mainstay since Dramatic Turn and on. The lyrics are typical JP cheese with traditional Labrie embellishments. The solo section is typical as well. The dueling keys and guitar are certainly nothing new. \n\nThe craziest part of this song is the god damn production. Like, how overproduced can you get before it becomes too much? I think the only band I like hearing overproduced is Devin Townsend, but DT needs space to hear the intricacies. Then again, there's nothing subtle or intricate about this song. The song is traditional DT made to hype people up for the album, but falls so short.\n\nHaving said all this, we are no stranger to the \"radio friendly\" single from DT. Status Seeker, Pull Me Under, Lie, The Looking Glass, Enemy Inside all are the same kind of neatly packaged format of a single. So, I am not too worried at this point. The single is what it is, and it is enough for now. \n\nLet's hope they do better though.\n",
        "\nUntethered Angel offers a refreshing look at what a Mangini-era Dream Theater could be given the previous calamity known as The Astonishing, but at the same time, it proves its point using a rather predictable formula. Simply put, it\u2019s a solid progressive metal song, but you could find a better version of this exact thing elsewhere in Dream Theater\u2019s oeuvre. The intro, for example, is copied essentially note-for-note from that of Ministry of Lost Souls, a phenomenal track from 2007\u2019s Systematic Chaos. The lyrics are clearly John Petrucci\u2019s way of recapturing some of the more balladic and melodic moments from Dream Theater\u2019s catalogue, most notably from 2009\u2019s Wither. \n\nUnfortunately, maligned lead vocalist James LaBrie still tries to sing these lyrics far outside his range, which has long since receded from its 1990s peak. The effects put on his voice mask some of the most glaring deficiencies in his vocal tone, but a live rendition of this song would likely not go over well. Had LaBrie sung just one (maybe one and a half) steps below where he actually sings, it might go over better; LaBrie ought to consider this a missed opportunity to redefine himself as a palatable mid-register vocalist, much like Geddy Lee did in the twilight of his days with Rush. \n\nAnother missed opportunity came in the form of the poor recording of Mangini\u2019s drums. I consider it one of the biggest missteps in metal today that Dream Theater has not had a decent drum mix since 2011\u2019s Breaking All Illusions. Mangini is, without a doubt, one of the most technically talented forces of nature to ever play the drums. So why do his bass drums have to sound like someone hitting a bag of flour with a wooden baseball bat? The drum part itself is stellar, but the manner in which his playing has translated to digital audio is less than satisfactory. \n\nWith all of that having been said, this single scores relatively high because it shows that the upcoming album has promise. For instance, John Myung finally can be heard, and he evidently still preforms at the peak of what is humanly possible. His melodic (and impressively smooth and non-contrived) bass playing is what enables Ruddess and Petrucci to trade the solos that wind up salvaging the song. On that topic, though the predictable formula of Petrucci playing one thing, Ruddess playing that same thing but with a certain twist, and then Petrucci taking it away for the rest of the breakdown has been used ad nauseam, it does work. \n\nDoes this single inspire confidence in the upcoming Distance Over Time album? Absolutely. It shows that the band has not become an empty vessel that Jordan Ruddess uses to make pointless noise, which is what I feared had happened after the release of The Astonishing. It shows that Mike Mangini is composing and playing parts that showcase his talent and allow the song room to breathe. It shows that John Myung is no longer an afterthought. It shows that Petrucci and Ruddess can still trade breakneck solos that the average mortal could only pretend to recreate. \n\nBut it also shows that James LaBrie continues to delude himself into thinking that he can hit high notes, and it shows that whoever is mixing and mastering this week has relatively little respect for the importance of the low toms and bass drums. And finally, it shows that de-facto bandleader John Petrucci still thinks that it's the mid-2000s. Overall, this song gets a mid-range C grade; palatable but not great. 74/100.\n",
        "\nThere were days when Dream Theater didn't used to suck. There were days when Dream Theater were a band full of passion and imagination. There were days when you could actually feel some sort of emotion from their music. There were days when 'Roadrunner Records' didn't call and say: \"hey guys, we need to send your sorry asses off to tour again and make us some money; so you got to produce us a new album ASAP!\".\n\n\"But those days are gone now,\nchanged like a leaf on a tree.\nBlown away forever \ninto the cool autumn breeze.\"\n\n'Untethered Angel' is as boring and clich\u00e9 as its title hints. In fact, it's even worse. We get to hear a slow, pointless opening guitar picking with a gloomy synth pad that wastes 30 seconds of our mundane life, right before the distortion pedal is turned on and Mangini makes some noise with his shiny cymbals. Labrie joins next with a monotonous, half-assed vocal melody, rhymes 'thread' with 'head' and sings a tiring story about some sort of angel that goes nowhere and mean nothing. Not much later, 'Petrucci' and 'Rudess' remind us that they still practice their scales daily and that they can finish their eleven hundred bars solos faster than you can finish your small cappuccino. The small difference though, is that while their solos are recycled and tasteless, your cappuccino isn't. At least I hope so.\n\nIf this single came from a new YouTube band that got a whole playlist of Dream Theater covers they filmed in their basement, I could be more forgiving. But holy crap, this single is actually by Dream Theater themselves! I've already heard everything in this song at least a gazillion times before. That Staccato riffing in the first verse sounds too identical to a song called 'The Mirror' they released in 1994. The whole 'keyboards- against-guitar-soloing\" is very predictable and redundant by now, and each vocal line sounds as dull and generic as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, Dream Theater has turned from a progressive to regressive band. There's more passion to be found in accounting firms than in this single and I really wish that after this upcoming album, they will take a long break before entering the studio again. Judging by this single, they totally deserve it.\n",
        "\nI've hardly made my opinion on this, the most well-known and iconic of progressive metal bands, unclear; if you've read my review of When Dream and Day Unite, I state it pretty unambiguously. Of course, some Dream Theater albums are better than others, which even die-hard fans of the band can likely agree with, and the first two albums with longtime vocalist James Labrie, Images and Words and Awake, are most often pointed out as unassailable bastions of progressive metal mastery. This being the case, I am going to do my darndest to go on and assail them anyway--in this case, my preference between the two (i.e. my favorite Labrie Dream Theater album), 1994's Awake.\n\nWe start out with \"6:00,\" a song title which, to me, seems iffy at best for a metal song, though perhaps there could be some clever justification of such a strange title. Upon listening to the track itself...no, no there is not. A jumble of unexciting media clips opens things up, followed by a \"groovy\" riff which to me evokes such things as the worst of Alder-era Fates Warning and much of Queensryche's 1990s output. For fans of popular modern progressive metal, I suppose this may put the riff in good company, but to me it sounds like a superficially aggressive, ultimately pitiful attempt to channel real rage, and Labrie's laughable tough-guy/macho vocal performance only confirms my impression. Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of the song, and their choice to make it the listener's first impression of the album is troubling at best.\n\n\"Caught in a Web\" does a lot more to warm me up to the idea of, if not enjoying, at least feeling neutral towards this album, with a stronger performance from Labrie evoking Urban Breed of Tad Morose fame - in fact, the riffing has similarities to Tad Morose as well, and while I'm not a huge fan of that band, either, this compares to some of their more enjoyable songs and, while the uber-prominent keys are never going to be my thing, I can at least understand the appeal here. Moving to \"Innocence Faded,\" we're presented with a softer, more thoughtful manifestation of the band, more overtly bringing to mind thoughts of the band's prog rock forefathers, Rush; and while I find Labrie's vocal lines--especially in the chorus--relatively underwhelming, I do appreciate the lead guitar, as, like much of Rush's output, it manages to noodle around a bit in a fun way without ever straying into \"guitar wankery\" territory. This is a welcome refreshment for Dream Theater, and I wish they would stick to such a paradigm more often.\n\nThe three-part sequence, \"A Mind Beside Itself,\" continues to channel Rush for the most part, and this is most evident in the ending of Part 2, where the building, swirling leads combine with some genuinely emotive lines from Labrie to create an atmosphere full of wonder, not dissimilar to Rush's well-known epic, \"2112.\" Unfortunately, Part 3 sees a devolution to banal, uninteresting acoustic chords with an equally bland Labrie accompanying, making my impression toward the epic overall rather mixed. However, I won't deny the band credit for the greatness of Part 2, especially in the second half, which is easily the high point of the album for me. \n\n\"The Mirror\" brings us back to the realm of aggression...which I don't think is the band's strong suit here, the opening riff being evidence of that in that it's literally one note repeated over and over, an impressively uninspired level of musical laziness usually reserved for genres like nu metal. I'm aware that a lot of modern progressive metal does make use of simplistic riffs, sometimes even to their credit when layered with other sounds, but for me this undeniably goes too far, especially against mediocre keyboard lines. Labrie's lines and performance are fairly good here, but aren't enough to hold the song together on their own, ultimately making this track another failure. \"Lie\" is more of the same, with semi-rapping, a new low point for Labrie--though for the chorus, he does shift back to the try-hard macho/tough guy vocals we heard in \"6:00.\" The only redeeming element is some cool soloing near the end, but that's not enough to change the fact that this track is thoroughly unenjoyable for me, and frankly it boggles my mind that such a track exists on an album so many seem to hail as the high point of progressive metal.\n\nThankfully, \"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\" eschews the shitty vocals and lame riffs again to deliver us a legitimately heartfelt ballad, which contains LaBrie's best performance on the album and some simple yet actually interesting riffs which work well as a backdrop to the centerpiece of Labrie. The last two minutes give us some echoes of the atmosphere that was explored at the end of \"A Mind Beside Itself Part 2,\" creating the only song on the album I really have no complaint with, and one that is legitimately worthy of praise. \"Scarred\" is also quite a strong number, creating a mysterious, ominous soundscape that works more often than not, though at times it does become overly repetitive. Mainly, it's that one simple metal riff that's repeated over and over again. It's not bad the first few times, but it's not strong enough to stand up to the repeated use it has here, and by the fifth or sixth time I'm just waiting for it to be over. However, that's the only complaint I have from an 11-minute song, so ultimately this holds up very well.\n\nFinishing out the album strong, \"Space-Dye Vest\" is a tasteful, introspective, and melancholic piece, and the band is surprisingly capable of pulling back when it needs to pull back--at least in this case. With somber keys and trembling, moody Labrie the only elements for much of the song, it's a stark contrast from most of the other tracks, and one that is most welcome. Unfortunately, the last couple of minutes start adding drums and synthesizer effects which only detract from the poignancy of the piece, though they are peeled back again in the final thirty seconds. So, ultimately, my review of the album is at least mixed, and there are clearly some good things going on here, but when it's bad it's just full-out dog shit, as in \"6:00,\" \"The Mirror,\" and \"Lie.\" It's certainly the most impressive of Labrie Dream Theater, and to my surprise I have actually given it an identical score to the band's debut, When Dream and Day Unite. However, it's certainly a far cry from being the pinnacle of progressive metal, or even modern progressive metal, and most of the accusations I have about the band (lack of real emotion, guitar and keyboard \"wankery,\" longwindedness) are still applicable here, although in a less virulent form. So, while I'm not at all recommending the album, if you have a burning desire to listen to the band, this album wouldn't be a bad choice.\n",
        "\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I want to make it clear from the beginning that I have been a shameless apologist for Dream Theater for many years. I find continued enjoyment in Falling into Infinity. Conversations about this band with my friends have resembled the absolute worst forum circlejerks given physical form. Multiple Dream Theater tracks were featured in the playlist at my wedding. If there were a religion based on Images and Words, I would join it. Dream Theater's music has, in a tangible sense, changed and enriched my life.\n\nTaking into consideration all of the above, I want it to be understood that I do not mean it lightly when I say I despise The Astonishing. In objective terms, it is not an abhorrent album. It was, ostensibly, born through considerable effort and genuine care from its creators. A true passion project. The type of project an artist might wistfully dream of one day creating, if only they had the time. Projects created without artistic passion and integrity rarely manage to produce such a visceral reaction. Nonsubstantive efforts typically amount to mediocrity. Laziness. A shrug, maybe a grunt of acknowledgment, and everyone moves on with their lives.\n\nThe Astonishing is the antithesis of an artistic effort achieved through mediocrity. It is so egregiously terrible because it was achieved through greatness allowed to run unchecked for far too long. It is the inevitable result of a band predisposed to excess and self-indulgence allowed to run rampant within their illusion of their own legendary image, with everyone around them enchanted by their spell of infallibility. As mentioned before, objectively, this is not a horrible album. It is competently performed and produced, a cohesive package, the product of a genuine artistic endeavor. Subjectively, this is one of the most revolting albums I have ever experienced.\n\nFor more than a decade now, starting roughly with 2005's Octavarium and becoming much more blatant on 2007's Systematic Chaos, Dream Theater has openly flirted with attempting to break into the world of mainstream rock recognition. Any reasonable observer would be inclined to point to the band's longstanding affiliation with Roadrunner Records as the cause - Black Clouds and Silver Linings received a full aisle-end display on its release day in 2009 at my local Best Buy in Bumfuck Nowhere, USA. This trend has seen Dream Theater - a band which once had enough self awareness to title their greatest hits album Greatest Hit in an open admission that Pull Me Under was their only song which had ever achieved anything resembling mainstream recognition - include at least one track on each subsequent album which was intended to become a marketable rock single. In broad strokes, these songs represent the nadir of Dream Theater's expansive catalog, the tracks which are always skipped on repeated listens to the albums which contain them. These songs see Dream Theater lean fully into all of their worst qualities - the copied and pasted electronic beats used by every djent band, constant crooning and soaring lead vocals contrasted with spoken backing vocals, power chords punctuated with wankery, and an utter inability to know when to stop - in a vain and nakedly brazen pursuit of revenue.\n\nThe Astonishing is the result of a band which has reduced its repertoire to include only the aforementioned elements thinking that it has a concept that rivals the The Wall in its staggering greatness and everyone around them believing them in spite of years of evidence to the contrary. There is not a single moment on this album which an intellectually honest person would attempt to argue qualifies as metal. Despite its glaringly bloated running time, at no point on this album does the band perform anything that would have been considered a riff prior to the proliferation of alternative rock and \u201cmetal\u201d bands in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The notion that this is the same band which recorded Images and Words and Awake is a travesty.\n\nThe common characterization of The Astonishing is that it is a rock opera. Roughly, it is 2112 meets Les Miserables. If you find that notion repugnant, move along. This is not the band for you, but you already knew that and you're reading this because you enjoy seeing the casual evisceration of what amounts to the turgid distillation of the essence of everything you detest about this band and its cult of followers. If you're enticed by the concept of Dream Theater playing up the theater aspect of their name, I have bad news for you. This album isn't winning a Tony Award.\n\nThe Astonishing goes beyond the paltry distinction of being a mere concept album. In essence, it is an audio play, a musical with no stage production and one man voicing all of the characters. As I mentioned before about being an apologist for this band, I want to again make it clear that I am a fan of James LaBrie. His attempt to voice all of this album's characters is one of its weakest points, one of the many reasons that it becomes such an unbearably overwrought listen so quickly. LaBrie has employed multiple voices in the past, most notably for Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory, in which he does an effective job of differentiating the blithe, innocent Victoria from the other characters in the narrative and thus makes her naivete about the danger she is in that much more crushing when she is murdered. For The Astonishing, LaBrie's voices convey little emotion beyond \u201cI'm the hero,\u201d \u201cI'm evil,\u201d and \u201cI'm a girl.\u201d I think this is partially because his range has noticeably decreased over the years, but I think the more significant problem is the unnecessary number of characters in the cast.\n\nLet's talk about the cast for a minute. There are so many characters. I'll be damned if I can ever remember anyone beyond Designated Hero Protagonist Guy, Faythe, and Lord Nefaryus. I want everyone to know that typing those names caused me physical pain. The characters and the narrative in which they exist are the most excruciating aspect of the album. At the heart of the matter, the reason why this album offends me so profoundly is this: How is it possible that a band which has created so much intricate music somehow spent years crafting and refining a story that, were it not being performed by Dream Theater, I would assume was lifted directly from an edgy high school student's notebook? It is truly uncanny the degree to which the narrative evokes the image of its author being a fifteen year-old who scribbled it in the margins of their algebra notebook and later shared it with their friends at the lunch table in a desperate bid to attempt to appear deep and mature. In my mind's eye, Faythe & Co. dress in clothes purchased from Hot Topic. Lord Nefaryus, being the cartoon villain he is, is Jafar from Disney's Aladdin. Hero Protagonist Guy is that one theater kid you knew in high school who thought he had real talent and was going to make the bigtime but instead burned out before the age of 20 and became the resident fedora tipper taking six years to finish a two-year program at your local community college. Together, the ragtag band of heroes teach the bad guy the true meaning of music and save America, or something equally as cloying and contrived. I find it impossible to care at all about any of the characters, and therein lies the failure of the narrative. There is no pathos.\n\nThe most common criticism of this album is that it contains very little actual musical content. Much like the criticisms levied at the narrative, they are well-founded. Randomly selecting a point in time in this album and pressing play is statistically more likely than not to land you on a piano-and-vocals interlude. Interlude is a misnomer, though, because when such aimless passages constitute the majority of an album's running time, they are no longer interludes. They are the content itself. This might have been a much more charming album if the narrative had taken a backseat to the music and the whole ordeal lasted around 45 minutes, but instead this album is the poster child of why double albums are, with very few exceptions, a terrible idea - the band rarely has enough content to fill two discs. Dream Theater certainly did not, and yet, therein lies the greatest paradox of this album. It is incredibly vacuous and starved for content, yet I would laugh at the idea that anything whatsoever was cut from it. I've never encountered another album that demands so much from the listener in exchange for so little in return. Disc two suffers from this in particular. Think the listener might be starved to hear some electric guitar or, god forbid, some actual drums? Time for another pointless minute of electronic noise. That will surely immerse them. We're in the future, you see.\n\nTo circle back to where we began, I want to emphasize that The Astonishing is not a product of laziness. It is not a cynical cash grab. It is as intricately crafted as anything Dream Theater has ever released, perhaps their most ambitious project to date. That's what I find so incomprehensible about it. How is it possible that a group of ostensibly responsible people all sat down in a room together, discussed this, and decided it was acceptable? It boggles my mind. How is it possible that seemingly nobody involved in the creative process spoke up and noted that perhaps this was too much of a departure from expectations even for a progressive metal band? The band was clearly surrounded by an army of yes-men. Everyone involved, including the band themselves, appears to have been convinced that everything the band touches turns to gold. That should have been plainly and demonstrably false after the events of the last fifteen or so years, but I wouldn't be here yelling into the void if that had been recognized somewhere along the way. Dream Theater's fans are commonly and correctly cited to be impossible to please, but this album is so far off-course that there was never any hope of it pleasing anyone but the artists themselves. That particular nugget of truth is why I argue that this album possesses genuine artistic integrity, but unfortunately, artistic integrity alone does not make a good album. Vision alone does not make one a genius, and change for change's sake does not equate to progress. This album was a legitimate undertaking from conception to release, created by people with decades of experience, and is an artistic failure on every level.\n\nSo why then do I give this album a score higher than zero percent? Because I am a brainwashed, card-carrying, certified member of this band's cult, and dammit, Our New World is a pretty enjoyable song. I can't help myself. Fuck this album, fuck everything that led to its creation, and most of all fuck me.\n",
        "\nTo be real, I have no idea how or when this tape landed in my collection. Let alone a factory sealed version. I\u2019m going to assume a flea market or my local record store when they still pedaled VHS. That\u2019s beside the point, all I know is that in January 2017 I dug this tape out of a drawer who\u2019s other tenants were two Rush VHS, Metallica\u2019s \u201c2 Of One\u201d VHS and The Best of Celebrity Death Match, as something to put on while I pissed away the night.\n\nNow to preface this, I wasn\u2019t too excited about the contents, probably why it took me as long as I did to finally watch it. Dream Theater live is something that I know is abysmal, the \u201cOnce In A Livetime\u201d album taught me that harsh lesson. But, surprised I was that Images & Words; Live In Tokyo was actually a lot of fun. \n\nI feel like this tape captures Dream Theater as close to their prime as they could\u2019ve been caught. James still has his voice, Keven Moore is still in the band, sure, there\u2019s some wank here but it isn\u2019t as bad as it could be (Hell, the only reason that this isn\u2019t getting a full score is the goddamn Portnoy drum solo). But, this tape is fun! Aside from the show, which is mostly Images & Words with a few others peppered around here and there, there\u2019s bits of the band running around various places on the tour, interviews and the three music videos from the album (one highlight in particular is Portnoy buying sushi from a Wendy\u2019s in Japan).\n\nThe tape picks up in the second half for sure, when \u201cTo Live Forever\u201d (which also, why was this song never on an album?) plays into the Petrucci solo then into \u201cTake The Time\u201d (which also has the first two minutes of \u201cThe Mirror\u201d as the intro??). All of it feels good, the Petrucci solo has a lot of emotion and soul in it and the extended outro of \u201cTake The Time\u201d is amazing. \n\nEver since I first dug this out it\u2019s entered the regular rotation of VHS that gets played often to play in the back while I\u2019m working, alongside such hits as Twister and Smokey & The Bandit. It\u2019s a fun tape of a band before they got too big for their britches, before their dipshit vocalist annihilated his one use in the band, and before their best keyboardist disappeared to make drone music or whatever he did after this band.\n",
        "\nComing after the more or less fucked up Train of Thought and the more or less forgettable Octavarium, we have the middle-of-the-road Systematic Chaos. I say it\u2019s a middle of the road album because it sounds more or less like what you\u2019d expect from Dream Theater during the time period, though without being particularly unique in the genre either. It\u2019s not easy to say that a 78 minute album with a two-part, 25 minute song is a safe play, but that\u2019s what it feels like in the context. There is nothing too experimental here, nothing too soft, nothing jarringly heavy, and not much that stands out as truly excellent in the band\u2019s long discography. That said, Systematic Chaos is a fairly likeable album.\n\nOne of the reasons why this feels like a safe bet is because the five-piece covered enough bases to make sure that no one could complain either of lax musicianship or a dearth of catchy material. The front half of the album (discounting the first installment of \u2018In the Presence of Enemies\u2019) contains the most immediately accessible material, including a five and a half minute rock single, a more metallic and technical version of the same, and the larger \u2018The Dark Eternal Night\u2019, which contains a memorable chorus alongside some instrumental diversions. The song \u2018Prophets of War\u2019 could easily be scooped into the \u201cmore accessible\u201d category too, not only by virtue of its length, but due to more restrained instrumentation that \u2013 as noted in Kluseba\u2019s review \u2013 gives it more than a passing similarity to Muse, both vocally and musically. Three songs head over 10 minutes, of which the closing second part of \u2018In the Presence of Enemies\u2019 is the most like what the band have done before on these kind of songs, while the other two work with variations of other aspects of their oeuvre.\n\nI mentioned that this is not especially experimental, meaning that there is less progressive than expansive about Systematic Chaos. Sure, Jordan Rudess plays a moderate role with keyboards and all of the longer songs encapsulate very specific instrumental sections, but the songs are not really that complex in construction, nor do any of the solos break any new ground despite the skill of the lead players. Compare this to Symphony X\u2019s Paradise Lost that was also released in 2007 (the bands in fact had a split single release) and much less progressive happens, while what does emerge from this perspective is going on in a more relaxed manner, more akin to prog rock than metal. Of course, Symphony X have the advantage of speed and a spliced power metal gene on their side, but the difference between their \u2018Domination\u2019 and Dream Theater\u2019s \u2018Constant Motion\u2019 would be glaringly obvious on a musical score as well. Add in to that the similarity of one song to Muse, the proximity of \u2018Forsaken\u2019 to some of Paradise Lost\u2019s early \u201800s material, and a generally more mainstream metal production; at this juncture, we find Dream Theater playing the role of followers, not leaders.\n\nHowever, it isn\u2019t necessary for every album to push the envelope, even if the band in question has done so in the past. The single material is certainly catchy and I enjoy all the songs from the first half of the album, probably rating the opening of \u2018In the Presence of Enemies\u2019 as the most musically interesting part of this release, though the drama of the break in \u2018The Dark Eternal Night\u2019 is also a highlight. \u2018The Ministry of Lost Souls\u2019 is a good shout for a melancholy semi-balladic epic towards the end of the album and would have made a suitable closer were it not for the other 16 minute epic that follows it. What epic songs should have is a good story in the lyrics, which James LaBrie more or less manages to pull off in \u2018Lost Souls\u2019, though he does sound a bit clingy with romantic lines like this: \u201cI was the one who would not abandon you / Even in death, I was the one who would not leave you\u201d. An additional problem is that his vocals are not powerful enough to carry some of the emotional climaxes and big choruses that are expected of him, which, contrasted with the beef of the guitars and drums, is a reasonable-sized problem. His delivery lacks conviction and volume at these moments, which would thankfully be improved on the much better follow-up Black Clouds and Silver Linings.\n\nAs a result of the variety and a few mediocre ideas, I\u2019m not so keen on the latter half of the album, especially seeing as \u2018Repentance\u2019 is a decent ballad stretched out way beyond its limits, while \u2018The Ministry of Lost Souls\u2019 could certainly do with cutting. As Dream Theater were not using as many progressive elements as on past albums, it seems baffling that they decided to extend the song lengths so much; this would have been a tighter album with about 20 minutes knocked off the combined length. As it is, Systematic Chaos is a palatable collection of material that I can listen to with medium concentration, though not a terribly significant point in Dream Theater\u2019s discography.\n",
        "\nLook at just about any review, any ranking and any retrospective regarding Dream Theater's discography. Chances are you'll see this album at the very bottom (or at least close to it). People usually have the same reasons for hating it. The vocals are wierd and annoying, the production is rough, it isn't technical enough, not enough emphasis on the guitar, no really long epics, etc. It doesn't quite sound like Dream Theater as most know them today. It has more in common with what was going on in the 80s metal scene and doesn't hold up as well, or so most people say. Or they'll just call it \"immature\" because it makes them look like they're being objective. But it wasn't always like this. Most people worshiped this album when it came out, including the members of Fates Warning. But because of Dream Theater's newfound fanbase rooted in other, more modern genres, this album is often panned. But it really doesn't deserve it at all, as it's really one of the band's best albums and a really important step forward for progressive metal.\n\nWhile this album doesn't feature the technical masturbation found on many of the subsequent Dream Theater albums, it does put more emphasis on shreddy riffs and odd/jazzy time signatures than anything else before it. Watchtower and Sieges Even are exceptions, but they were more thrash-oriented. It takes more direct influence from 70s and 80s prog rock than any other metal album before it. Even Perfect Symmetry by Fates Warning doesn't have this much overt homage to Yes and Rush (despite it being a slightly better album). Although it does seem to take more from what Rush was doing in the early 80s than their classic 70s output. Because of this, When Dream and Day Unite is the most synth-driven Dream Theater album (or at least the most synth-driven Dream Theater album that's actually metal). But this actually works for the album. Kevin Moore is my favorite metal keyboardist and this album doesn't count against that. His keyboard-work is cold, atmospheric, often symphonic and very beautiful, without being overly soft or wanky. Kevin is known to be very atmospheric with his playing. Because of his high prominence here, this is probably the most atmospheric Dream Theater album. It sounds chaotic, yet beautiful at the same time, without being too weak or too intense for its own good.\n\nAnother thing that adds to this is the production. It's pretty reverb-heavy and somewhat raw. It's a lot like the production on Legendary Tales by Rhapsody. But it adds to the murky nature of the music. But because of the highly clean and sterile nature of most production on modern prog metal albums, this gets a bad reputation from most fans of that. It's really not even all that bad. The mixing is actually really good. You can hear everything, including the bass, which is something Dream Theater isn't known for. Which is a good thing, as Myung is a genuinely great bassist. Songs like \"A Fortune in Lies\" and \"The Killing Hand\" have the dark, mystical atmosphere that they do in part because of the production, though mostly because of the music. But the reason why the music itself feels like this is because of the clear power metal influence. Fates Warning, Crimson Glory, Heir Apparent and other progressive power metal bands were all an influence on this album. It was very uncommon for progressive metal in the 1980s to not have power metal influences, although this does dial it back more than those bands.\n\nBut what really kills this album for most people is the same thing that killed early Fates Warning for most people. The vocalist has a strange tone that can be annoying for some listeners. Charlie Dominici was a soul singer before this, which gives him a different background than other singers in his field. He does clearly take influence from metal singers though, particularly Geoff Tate, due to his open-throat phrasing. But the singer he most resembles is Geddy Lee from Rush, though a bit less nasally and more operatic. I personally think his voice is beautiful and perfectly fits the music, though he did put me off the first time I heard it. He tends to almost gasp when he hits semi-high notes and his voice is somewhat effeminate, but in a good way. The same way that James Labrie does, though a bit weirder. He has no problem staying on key and his sustain is good, meaning that there really isn't anything technically bad about him, other than him sometimes having trouble hitting some higher notes. People just need to adjust to him to like him more.\n\nThe songs are some of the best that Dream Theater ever did. \"A Fortune in Lies\" is epic and gloomy, but without sacrificing energy. It actually gets thrashy early in the song, with a palm-muted bottom string riff accompanied by fast double-bass, though that only lasts for a little while. Meanwhile, \"The Killing Hand\" keeps that sense of gloom and mysticism, but with a more relaxing and enchanting tone, mostly due to the beautiful keyboard work. It's probably the closing thing to a traditional Dream Theater epic on here, due to the multi-part structure and length of the song, though other songs are only a little shorter. \"Ytse Jam\" is catchy, but very technical, with lightning fast melodic guitar work, almost like a cross between Queensryche and Watchtower. People who like Dream Theater for their technicality will probably like this song the most. But my personal favorite track is the closer, \"Only a Matter of Time\". This is because of the song's ability to have a triumphant, almost Fifth Angel resemblant feel while still keeping the progressive mindset of the rest of the album, mainly due to the very interesting and tension-building rhythm of the main verse. The lyrics on this song are easily the best that Kevin Moore ever wrote, telling a story about a father letting his son go off to war.\n\n\"A father's benediction as his hopeful son departs\nTo brave the sea of rage and conquer at all costs\nLingers in his memory and visions still surviving\nIn a logic proof shell\nThat should have been held sacred, safe and hidden well\nAre compromised in usury\"\n\nHis lyrics really capture the desperation and internal conflict that the father feels. It also has Charlie at his best vocally, delivering a frantic and heartfelt performance that fits the music like a glove. Not to say that every other song isn't a standout. Really the only song that I don't like too much is \"Status Seeker\". A new wave song with metal guitars, it's actually pretty decent for what it is, but the 80s cheese is a little difficult to stomach. It also features the absolutely awful lyric, \"You draw a battle line with the dollar sign\". That's pretty much the only issue on the whole album, as everything else is in top form. It's a consistent album with lots of memorable songs with more value than many people would have you believe.\n\nIt's more than just memorability that saves this album from the shit that it gets. It's everything going on that isn't on one particular track. The instrumentation really isn't any less creative than it tends to be with Dream Theater (and it does so without being pretentious), the songs are emotive without being sappy, and it's just a milestone in the evolution of progressive metal as a whole. But unfortunately, it receives almost never-ending hate from many fans for things that really don't deserve it. But the truth is that When Dream and Day Unite is a masterpiece and one of the best things Dream Theater ever wrote. It just isn't as appealing to the modern progressive crowd. It's so hugely important and accomplished, but the low reputation it gets pushes listeners away. This is why I consider it to be the most underrated progressive metal album ever. Don't buy into the undeserved neglect it gets, you'll just have more music to enjoy than people who've been scared away.\n",
        "\nDream Theater is often accused of favoring a display of musical virtuosity over songwriting and lacking in the quality control department. All true, but when they are good, they are really good, which is what makes them one of the flagships of progressive metal. Despite experimenting with conceptual pieces since their debut album, it took them until the late nineties to come up with a full-blown concept album. And whether it is a result of its conceptual nature or not, it would take them close to another decade before they released another album as consistently good as \u2018Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\u2019.\n\n\u2018Scenes From A Memory\u2019 is such an enjoyable listen, because it avoids most of the pitfalls that many modern progressive bands imitating Dream Theater \u2013 and sometimes the Americans themselves \u2013 suffer from. Especially the overly compressed production with the genre is nowhere to be found. Both sonically and in the songwriting department, the album is dynamic and organic, making listening through the entire album a particularly pleasant experience. There are never any solos that get in the way of the songs. If anything, John Petrucci\u2019s solo is what saves the particularly sappy ballad \u2018The Spirit Carries On\u2019.\n\nWhen I first heard the album in my early teens, I did not get it. It was too complex for me and I thought some songs needed too much time to get to the point. In those days, \u2018Beyond This Life\u2019 was the only song that made some impact on me through its deceptively simple, crushing main riff in 5/4 and its general dark atmosphere. While I still love that song to this day, the brooding, almost doomy \u2018Home\u2019 is easily the most moving song on \u2018Scenes From A Memory\u2019. The dark, downtempo riffs have a vaguely Middle-Eastern flair that really enhances the tension in this part of the story.\n\nInstrumental track \u2018The Dance Of Eternity\u2019 is a fan favorite and it is not difficult to hear why, as it really puts the musical skills of Petrucci, drummer Mike Portnoy, bassist John Myung and then new keyboard player Jordan Rudess to the fore, not unlike \u2018Overture 1928\u2019. Personally, I am quite fond of \u2018One Last Time\u2019, which it morphs into. It is easily the best of the album\u2019s more introspective moments, because it has a distinct early Genesis vibe; the inspiration of \u2018Broadway Melody of 1974\u2019 is quite obvious. \u2018Strange Deja Vu\u2019 and \u2018Fatal Tragedy\u2019 are nice, dynamic tracks that interestingly feature equal measures of progressive rock and metal.\n\nThe ballads are a matter of taste. Whether or not you will like them depends largely on how much you like James LaBrie\u2019s dramatic delivery, though it is worth noting that \u2018Finally Free\u2019 surpasses \u2018Through Her Eyes\u2019 and \u2018The Spirit Carries On\u2019 in sheer dynamism and atmosphere. As a whole, \u2018Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\u2019 is an album that has a really pleasant flow, which is never outshone by the musicianship. Concept albums can certainly be a bit of a slippery slope, but Dream Theater\u2019s progressive music seems to be tailor-made for the situation and it has resulted in one of their more consistent outings thus far.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Home\u2019, \u2018Beyond This Life\u2019, \u2018One Last Time\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog\n",
        "\nThis cover is damn near perfect. But I still had to give it a score under 50% because of one thing: The vocals. James Hetfield would kill himself just so he could spin in his grave. The singer, James LaBrie, is obviously trying really hard to be something that he's not. And I don't know why he would even make that attempt, seeing as how it'd have been in this album's best interest for him to sing in a lower register, rather than one so high it's out of his range. \n\nHe sounds like a southern grandma with a long, nasal drawl as he screams the word \"Battery\" at the top of his lungs. He sounds like a crying baby when he belts out the words, \"master of puppets, I'm pulling your streeeeeeeeeighnnnnsssss [sic]!\" It's just not listenable. James LaBrie is why Orion (the instrumental) is the best song on this cover album, by far. \n\nAnd it's really sad that this is the case. It's not like this cover is otherwise unsalvageable, and in no way are the vocals just another dog turd on the front lawn. The cover is really, really good. For those who think that Mike Portnoy (a god) would be out of his element playing the drum parts of Lars Ulrich (not really a god), think again: He restrains himself reasonably well while still tastefully using some of that foot speed in places where Lars originally couldn't. Same goes for John Petrucci on the guitar. He ups the ante, adding on to a already impressive effort by Kirk Hammett and James Hetfield. John Myung plays almost exactly as he did on the album, but he's a bassist, so that's essentially what he's supposed to do. I'm not quite sure what it is that Jordan Ruddes did, but I guess it worked. My one gripe as far as instrumentation goes is that the guitars and keyboards occupied the exact same part of the mix, meaning that they were fighting for auditory space while still managing to be indistinguishable from one another. \n\nGood cover of a good album. Terrible vocals, though. 49/100.\n",
        "\nIn 2003, what would your expectation of a Dream Theater album have been? I was busy listening to my sister's Now! 42 (which anyone from the UK will surely remember with a mixture of nostalgia and repugnance), so I didn't know what Dream Theater were doing, though it sure as shit wasn't the same as what they had done up to that point. Saying that the New Yorkers were \"a musician's band\" or played \"thinking man's metal\" was not really much of an exaggeration when considering releases like Awake and Metropolis pt.2: Scenes from a Memory, though it's not likely that Train of Thought will be the recipient of those same titles except by association. Whatever notion attacked the band between the preceding album and this one, we find here quite a degree of difference between this and any of the previous (and indeed later) DT releases, drawing from some unusual quarters in terms of influence and bearing evidence of some crazy decisions.\n\nI think it's worth stating that the band didn't completely go off the rails with Train of Thought, much of the material being recognizable as DT work, even if the key points of the album are rather easier to summarize than usual. There are still progressive touches to be found in the songs, notably the lengths, the extended instrumental sections, and the tendency of everyone but James LaBrie to complicate their roles, though these features are toned down to highlight simpler elements like riffing, repetition, and playing style, all of which make a larger or altered impact to prior albums. Unmistakably the first thing to distinguish this from most prog metal is the heft of John Petrucci's guitar, a feature which he hauls around like a big slab of Candlemass on opening song 'As I Am' and continues to use in heavier and groovier style throughout the album, barring his leads, which he changes little from his well-known technical and melodic prowess. There is that same slow, crushing heaviness exhibited at the beginning of \u2018In the Name of God\u2019, which could easily be an epic doom or modern power metal opening, though John Myung drops in with the kind of down-tempo bassline that could win him a place in Warning or Saint Vitus. That\u2019s not the only time the band opt for slow and low, though more on that later.\n\nAside from the string players messing around with their tones, the keyboards are rather a different feature than they might be supposed for a progressive band with only one guitarist. Jordan Rudess isn\u2019t exactly absent either, just playing outside his accustomed role, more like a power metal or modern metal musician might contribute, adding drama to some of Portnoy\u2019s big lurching riffs, while his electronic work is halfway between a DJ (there\u2019s a hint of a few breakbeats at moments) and what Mark Spicuzza was doing in Chimaira at about the same time. In itself, the odd style of those three musicians isn\u2019t necessarily problematic; it\u2019s more that as a really silly synthesized guitar solo finishes its endless whirling around in the closer, Rudess plays a few light tinkles on the piano, then everybody coordinates for a gradual crescendo and LaBrie leads into a final chorus of supposedly epic proportions. Dream Theater don\u2019t seem to have a plan on Train of Thought and it shows in some more jarring examples than just that one.\n\n\u2018This Dying Soul\u2019 is one of the examples that must be spoken about, even if we have to speak about it in hushed tones so as not to scare people. It is a bamboozling mixture of influences, starting off with a Machine Head riff, spiralling off on some recognizable DT solo work that returns thrice in the song, drops into a kind of groovy lurch, steals a verse from Mudvayne of all bands; later, it goes for distorted vocals and rhythmic riffing that the nu metal brigade were just about done with in 2003, Rudess briefly auditions for Spineshank and they almost let him in, then he wonders if it wasn\u2019t Stratovarius that he was interested in; after that, the whole band goes full-on Dry Kill Logic alongside another different keyboard style, one of the two choruses resurfaces, there\u2019s a quick improvised attempt at creating symphonic thrash, Petrucci plays a normal solo while Munky and Head from Korn back him up, Kai Hansen appears - ejaculates - and the song ends. And don\u2019t forget, this is an 11 minute song. There are some repeating parts, though nothing representing a structure or a brain between the five members. I won\u2019t do the same description for every song, but \u2018Honor Thy Father\u2019 has rapping, which suffices to say that there are worse parts.\n\nThere are some decent moments as well, not least \u2018Endless Sacrifice\u2019, which is the only time when the band sound all on the same page. It still has a pretty lumpen nu metal riff with a horrid harmonic squeal thrown in, though it hangs together pretty well and has a diverting lead progression in the middle, the same that can be said of a few other numbers in addition to the disorganized instrumental \u2018Stream of Consciousness\u2019. Also important to note is that when the band stop attempting to be down with the kids and acting like they were cool in 2003, the chunky tones and varied keyboards do work. The first and last songs contain nice riff work and sound pretty badass at moments, yet that doesn\u2019t balance well with the other laughable moments. In essence, this is what happens when \u201cthinking men\u201d stop thinking and just assimilate whatever they hear on the radio into their music, leaving us with an album of head-scratching weirdness, a few decent tunes, and some unintentional comedy. In any case, this is still more fun than Awake.\n",
        "\nI generally hold live albums to a higher standard than I do studio albums. My rationale is simple: The band is recording pre-written material and are given more creative and musical latitude by an audience than they\u2019d get from a professional recording engineer. Ergo, by virtue of having both a lower creative onus and more leeway, the band can afford to expend their efforts elsewhere. Preferably, on the album itself.\n\nBreaking the Fourth Wall delivers, even given the high bar to which live albums ought to be held. \n\nFirst, the musical execution. It\u2019s spot-on. James LaBrie isn\u2019t exactly the most consistent performer, and his shellfish-related injury (he ruptured his vocal chords coughing up bad clams) certainly didn\u2019t help. However, he takes the stage in good shape, both as an emcee and as the lead vocalist. Still sounding nasal at times, however, LaBrie isn\u2019t exactly perfect, and his breathiness can gnaw on the nerves of a listener, especially in balladic sections. \n\nJohn Myung and Mike Mangini perform as solidly as humanly possible, as they always do. Both incredibly talented musicians, neither hog the limelight yet both get their fair share of glory. Trapped behind his fortress-like drumkit, Mangini continually belts out polyrhythms and inhuman right hand/left foot coordination. Likewise, John Myung is consistently in complete synchronization with Mangini\u2019s speedy and complex bass drumming and misses nary a note through the whole show. \n\nKeyboardist Jordan Rudess and guitarist John Petrucci are no worse, for that matter. Both have performances of a lifetime. Petrucci, adapting to his increased duties as the band\u2019s secondary vocalist (Mike Portnoy had departed the band, and none of the other band members sing backup to James LaBrie), is as quick-fingered and tantalizing as ever. Rudess is similarly engaging and exciting to watch, though his self-indulgence does, at times, impede the flow of the music. For example, one could do without the necessary frills on Space Dye Vest.\n\nFinally, Eren Ba\u015fbu\u011f conducts the choir and pit quite well. Dream Theater has never been shy about incorporating symphonic elements into their shows, and there\u2019s no better conductor for this particular setlist than Mr. Ba\u015fbu\u011f himself. Leading the Berklee College of Music orchestra and choir, Ba\u015fbu\u011f\u2019s restrained yet upfront approach to adding extra dimensionality to Dream Theater\u2019s music yields major dividends, especially when it comes to augmenting the low end of the mix and the mid-range of LaBrie\u2019s vocals. \n\nThe next area of success that this album has is on the setlist. Opening with The Enemy Inside was a wise choice: It\u2019s an adrenaline-pumping and anthemic metal song, the chorus of which has elements of Bon Jovi-style catharsis. By no means is this a bad song to use so as to kick off a concert. \n\nFollowing The Enemy Inside are some of Dream Theater\u2019s good-not-great songs. This is par for the course when it comes to the first disc of a multipart live concert. Highlights include The Shattered Fortress and Trial of Tears, executed with an unprecedentedly soulful intro from John Petrucci. To conclude the first disc, the band pulls out all the stops with an Enigma Machine-Along For the Ride-Breaking All Illusions tetralogy, boasting a Mike Mangini drum solo, more of that pop-oriented crowd pleasing, and then one of Dream Theater\u2019s signature epics. \n\nThe setlist in the second disc isn\u2019t quite as well put together, but it\u2019s still decent enough. The band returns from intermission with a classic from their Awake album, The Mirror, soon to be followed by Scarred, also from Awake. Then, as a \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d entr\u2019acte, Space Dye Vest, again from Awake. It was not a great call to use Space Dye Vest as the penultimate song, given its relative obscurity (especially in the context of live shows\u2013Dream Theater had seldom played this live since Kevin Moore\u2019s departure), but it bridges the gap between Scarred and the grand finale ably. Ministry of Lost Souls, however, or perhaps Another Day would have been better choices, but these are nitpicky criticisms. \n\nThen, the most important part of any show: The grand finale. Dream Theater executed this perfectly. They chose a song that epitomizes the band\u2019s core facets: Its progressiveness, its emphasis on metal and on riffing, the solositic tendencies of its members, and James LaBrie\u2019s penchant for shrieking. They chose Illumination Theory to conclude this show, and it certainly did the trick. Incorporating a key tar solo from Jordan Rudess, several sentimental quips from James LaBrie between verses, incredible rhythmic performances by Mike Mangini and John Myung, and several monstrous, earth-shattering John Petrucci solos, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a song that would have ended this legendary concert better than Illumination Theory. \n\nThen, the encore: Scenes From a Memory. They play Overture 1928, Strange D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, Dance of Eternity, and Finally Free. A glaring omission is Spirit Carries On,, though that\u2019s certainly forgivable given the abundance of downtempo and emotional songs throughout the performance proper. A well-selected, perfectly executed (Petrucci\u2019s solo in Overture 1928 is one of the greatest of all time, and no one misses a beat, even in the sheer chaos of Dance of Eternity) end to a great performance. 92/100.\n",
        "\nFalling into Infinity was terrible. Embodying the worst of prog metal\u2013glitzy keyboard wankery, poor mastering, et cetera, et cetera\u2013the album looked like a nail in Dream Theater's coffin. And then they did this. With the addition of Jordan Rudess, everything seems to fall into place. The prog? There, in full force. The metal? Also there, and delightfully understated at times, and always sophisticatedly nuanced. The tone, rhythm, and timbre? All there as well. \n\nStarting with Regression/Overture 1928, we\u2019re confronted by an ominous narration, forlorn yet approachable acoustic balladry, then a full-blown assault in the form of some of the most uptempo and heavy three to four minutes in Dream Theater\u2019s vast oeuvre, complete with one of John Petrucci\u2019s best ever guitar solos. And it\u2019s only uphill from here: As we\u2019re introduced to Nicholas, the story\u2019s protagonist (oh, yeah. There\u2019s also a well-developed, non-cheesy story integrated into the album\u2013that a band can make music this perfect and make it tell a story about past-life regression therapy is quite impressive), and his alter ego, Victoria, we also have a front-row seat to some of John Myung\u2019s best ever work. \n\nThough Petrucci is undoubtedly the star of the show\u2013there\u2019s nary a song on the album that is anything less than metal guitar genius\u2013John Myung, indeed, is the main hero of the album, and that\u2019s quite clear even from early on: In Beyond this Life, it\u2019s noticeable and, frankly, amazing how well he anchors Mike Portnoy\u2019s eccentric drumming while simultaneously enabling solo after solo after solo from Petrucci. And the bass lines are pretty good, too\u2013He\u2019s not just a timekeeper in this album. \n\nBut that\u2019s enough about the bass player. Also putting their best feet forward are Jordan Rudess, whose piano wizardry is evident, for example, on the intro to One Last Time, and Mike Portnoy with is double-bass antics, otherworldly rhythmic ability (listen to Dance of Eternity, one of the most complex and baffling songs ever written in terms of sheer technicality), and lyrical contributions. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s James LaBrie. He hasn\u2019t always sounded great. In fact, he sometimes is horrible. Remember when Dream Theater played at Wacken back in 2015? That was a disgrace. Or when the band tried to cover Metallica\u2019s Master of Puppets? That didn\u2019t work out too well for James, either. \n\nBut this album is different. Namely, because it was recorded before he ruptured his vocal chords coughing up bad shellfish. But it\u2019s not just the luck of temporality. There\u2019s something more than that: LaBrie\u2019s pitch control is absolutely perfect. Like Geoff Tate, only more multidimensional. From the low susurrus of Through My Words to the emotional shrieking in the reprisals in Spirit Carries On, LaBrie constantly puts himself in situations with very little margins for error, then executes perfectly. \n\nAnd, finally, John Petrucci. What am I supposed to say about John Petrucci? I\u2019d compare him to God, but that\u2019s hardly fair to God. Whether he\u2019s sweep-picking through arpeggios on Home, gently strumming a 12-string on Finally Free or laying down a solid, catchy metal riff on Fatal Tragedy, everything that this guitarist extraordinaire does is simply perfect: His solos are emotional, uptempo, and completely match the ambience of any given point in the story. It\u2019s uncanny, actually. \n\nBut it\u2019s more than uncanny: It\u2019s musical genius in its most perfectly refined and well-executed form. 99/100.\n\nBest Songs: Overture 1928, Strange Deja Vu, Fatal Tragedy, Beyond This Life, Home, Dance of Eternity, One Last Time, Spirit Carries On, Finally Free.\n\nWorst Song: Through Her Eyes (the only reason I didn't give this album 100/100).\n",
        "\nOh, how the mighty have fallen. Remember Images & Words, one of the greatest metal albums ever made? Or how about Awake, a prog masterpiece? \n\nThe Astonishing is only astonishing for one reason: It\u2019s astonishingly bland. It\u2019s two hours of Elton John-style piano ballads, muted and downtrodden technical wankery, and occasional dubstep interludes. You\u2019d might as well just listen to one of Jordan Rudess\u2019 many side projects. One of his solo albums would cost a lot less to purchase and would ask for a lot less of your time. They're also mostly a lot better than this hot mess that he and John Petrucci cooked up. \n\nAfter Black Clouds & Silver Linings, Mike Portnoy\u2019s departure had the band in a state of borderline creative turmoil. Mike Mangini, however, was a very welcome replacement, and he gave the band a more-than-solid drumkit presence on A Dramatic Turn of Events and on the band\u2019s eponymous album. Look no further than Bridges in the Sky, Enigma Machine, or Illumination Theory for proof. \n\nBut The Astonishing is what happens when Mike Mangini is treated as a session musician. He\u2019s turned way down in the mix, the mastering makes his famous \u201cgolden ratio\u201d snare sound lifeless, and I can\u2019t quite always differentiate his toms from Jordan Rudess\u2019 keys. Though Mangini\u2019s freeze-dried, electronic-sounding snare is on full display, that\u2019s about all there is to hear. Even his bass drums-the anchor of damn near any metal album\u2013sound like someone hitting a sack of cornstarch with a baseball bat. Dull, lifeless, and with no sustain to speak of. This is not a recipe for success, and it shows. \n\nIn addition to Mike Mangini\u2019s sonic banishment, also noticeably absent from the limelight is bassist John Myung. It\u2019s as if Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci decided that a rhythm section wasn\u2019t worth having. Indeed, the volume and prominence levels devoted to Mike Mangini and to John Myung are depressingly, stunningly, and shamefully low. Listen, for example, to A Better Life. The rhythm section is lifeless. Incorporating the airiness and sparseness of Nick Mason with muted double-bass rolls and sophomoric bass frills, it\u2019s little short of a musical embarrassment. It\u2019s basically what would happen if someone were to throw a wet, fuzzy blanket over a speaker that happened to be playing a decently-mixed rhythm section.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the storyline. A 2112-style dystopianism admixed sloppily with Quadrophenia-esque soul-searching, and then dashed with the former glory of Metropolis Pt. 2's murder mystery plot. How many different characters are there? It\u2019s hard to say, though James LaBrie does his best to comically alter his voice to depict different antagonists. Who winds up victorious in the end? I\u2019m not entirely sure, though I\u2019ll figure out if I decide to buy the novella based on The Astonishing\u2019s plotline. \n\nOh, yes. There\u2019s a novella. That may be the album\u2019s most laughable offense, if not the one that most thinly veils the band's self-indulgence. Tell me this: What kind of over-marketed, radio-friendly musical drudgery has a novella to go along with it? The only time that this has worked out remotely well for anyone is when Rush helped write a book based on the plot of Clockwork Angels, and the only reason that that wasn\u2019t a complete disaster is that lyrical genius Neal Peart was at the helm. Make no mistakes about, though: John Petrucci is not Neal Peart. As someone who loves Dream Theater, I feel like a chump, honestly. I feel like Dream Theater made an album out of sheer self-importance, sold it for $18.99 on iTunes (no, that is not a typo), and then got even greedier and played their fans for suckers by releasing a whole line of shitty merchandise. \n\nBut the album\u2019s single worst offense is its length. It\u2019s two hours. Two hours of the same hyper-technical, minimally engaging sonic sludge. It\u2019s not without its saving graces: Our New World, A New Beginning, Three Days, Dystopian Overture, and 2285 Ent\u2019racte are all solid progressive metal songs. The main problem here is that, collectively, these listenable songs make up about 15% of the album in its totality. It\u2019s too long to only have five songs worth hearing. Listening to music is an investment: You spend time and hope to gain some level of enjoyment. And considering the paltry returns juxtaposed with the temporal opportunity cost, The Astonishing isn\u2019t a very good investment. 38/100.\n",
        "\nBefore I begin, I'd like to come clean: I have zero experience with Dream Theater's music. I've never sat through one of their albums prior to the preparation for this review, and I've wiped my slate clean of all expectations. I have heard of this album as being heavier than past albums by the band, but that is ultimately meaningless because I don't know what is deemed as being 'heavy' for this band. Aside from this I've also heard of the usual critiques of this band - 'they noodle aimlessly and James LaBrie sounds awful' says the detractors and 'they're progressive and visionary' says the fans - so I genuinely had no idea what to expect.\n\nUnpacking the performances reveals that Dream Theater had a pretty clear train of thought when writing this album - the words 'progressive' and 'metal' are quite blatant misnomers, and the character of the riffs and especially the vocals puts me in mind of that breed of alternative/nu-metal that was quite prevalent in the world of rock back in the early to mid '00s. The idea that this album is in any way heavy is a purely aesthetic observation - the guitars on this album largely play very little of substance, opting instead for hypnotic and repetitive 2 to 3 note fragmented riffs mixed up with the occasional groove and some outright chugs that are about as far removed from any sort of metal as is possible. Any heaviness comes through only in the muddy nu metal guitar tone, as opposed to any quality riffing. \n\nAs the album unfolds a clear pattern emerges in the instruments - repetitive and worthless instrumental sections with some really blatant window dressing thrown in. Said dressing can range from very short melodic leads between chugs to short drum solos to lengthy leads. To be fair, no single song contains one very large reservoir of wank, with it being spread fairly evenly throughout - with the exception of 'Stream of Consciousness', an 11 minute load of technical masturbation that doesn't go anywhere. Any technical chops exhibited throughout this album are utterly negated by the incoherent non-arrangement and misdirection of said chops. Even more obvious bouts of compensation come about with the usage of keyboards, which simply follow what the guitars are doing and are never given a chance to soar at all. I suppose the effect was to layer the music and give it an air of grandiosity but it falls flat given the utterly comical and broken nature of what is playing beneath them. \n\nAnother one of this album's annoying characteristics is the tendency towards vocal orientation. There is clear pattern of the redundant faeces being played when James LaBrie keeps quiet being thrown out for a tuneless atmospheric interlude as in 'As I Am' or totally boring and uninvolved mechanical chugs that are as redundant as can be, with the rhythm either complementing the vocal line above or, as 'Honor Thy Father' demonstrates, deliberately being syncopated to give a quasi-rap cadence to LaBrie's singing. All of this would be fine if the void left by the instruments could be filled with something compelling but this isn't the case, given that James appears to have listened to one too many Creed albums. His voice has taken on that slightly gravelly radio-rock tone that is both completely inappropriate given that the music has more in common with nu metal than it does any sort of post-grunge drivel that steeped the airwaves of the time, and grating given that he sounds awful anyway. His voice suffers from that same vaguely tuneless and whiny tone that is common in this style of music, and the similarly anti-melodic vocal lines only compound this problem. The surprisingly hook-y nature of this album (with a lame radio rock hook being shoehorned into every song) makes this problem even worse than it needs to be, along with the needless electronic distortion done to his voice on songs like 'This Dying Soul'.\n\nThe worst thing about this album though is simply that it carries almost no structural intrigue with it at all. The number of times the band will repeat a riff throughout a song is quite astounding. Individual sections of songs are never developed at all, and every monolithic chunk of the song doesn't flow into the next part. A random atmospheric part will follow a loud hook, which will then be followed by a fit of directionless soloing which leads into another revolting quiet verse. The songs are simply far too long given that they carry so few ideas, and even fewer of quality. Every song rigidly adheres to a distinctly stagnant structure, which is the exact opposite of what progressive metal should be - a series of flowing ideas that are dwelled upon for long enough and developed in said time. This idea that this is somehow an experimental return to form is completely nonsensical. Even though I've never heard another album by this outfit I refuse to believe that they ever wrote drivel like this before this album. There is almost nothing of worth here, with any good bits being negated by bad parts and all of it being wrapped up in structures that are simplistic, lazy and overly dogmatic yet completely incoherent. It is simply a tragic misfire of an album that is a waste of everybody\u2019s time.\n",
        "\n\"My questioning mind has helped me to find the meaning in my life again.\"\nDream Theater's greatest chapter is a reminder that masterpieces tend to be greater than the sum of their parts. Taking Scenes from a Memory on a song-by-song basis doesn't scream perfection the way it does when the album is approached as a whole. It's tough to think about this album, let alone review it, without thinking about the major role it had in my life at a relatively early stage. Along with Crimson Glory's Transcendence and Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force, this was one of the albums that facilitated my conversion to metal at the age of 11. As it happens, I remember the day that the CD finally came in the mail. It was the day I was supposed to attend my graduation ceremony for elementary school. When I noticed that the package had arrived in the mail, I made a point of finding a way to stay home just so I could listen to the record all day. I can still remember laying down on my bed, reading through the booklet and obsessing over each and every track on the album. I felt like my mind was being opened to a new world. That's not the sort of memory you get to make every day.\n\nNow, over half a lifetime later, it's still one of those few age-old albums I still put on at least semi-regularly. In the thirteen years since I first heard it, my tastes have obviously changed quite a bit, but I think there's always a certain part of me that reverts back to that childlike sense of wonder whenever I put on Scenes from a Memory. Does that make a difficult album to review? Honestly, even if the material is so familiar to me, the rare blend of depth and feeling on this record makes it easy to become excited about it all over again. Although I have strong feelings towards almost all of Dream Theater's albums (most good, some bad), Scenes from a Memory was always the one that stood out the most as a masterpiece. Images & Words can seem a bit airy and neo-proggish for my tastes at times, while Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, great as it is, lacks the pristine consistency of this one. That said, I'm not sure it would be the easiest of their albums to recommend. As I said at the beginning, Scenes from a Memory is best when taken as a whole. It offers the best of itself when the listener completely invests in it. Fortunately I had a lot of spare time in my younger days and the spins of this album hit double digits by the second day of owning it.\n\nFor detractors, Dream Theater tend to be dismissed for their supposed dryness and wankery. Although I obviously see where they're coming from, I don't think that playing x number of notes was ever the thing that possibly held them back at times. To the contrary, it was often their attempts to be emotional and melodic that risked the biggest eye rolling from yours truly. Where albums like The Astonishing opted far too much for the feeling, and Train of Thought was too wanky, Scenes from a Memory offered the near-perfect mix of melodic beauty and mind-bending finesse. Each of their two sides helped to validate the existence of the other. On their own, the ballads on this album (specifically \"Through Her Eyes\" and \"The Spirit Carries On\") might have felt hammy, did they not act as a heartfelt reprieve from the proggy fireworks. Take the urgent monster \"Beyond This Life\" for instance (incidentally the first DT track I ever heard), on the one hand it's a frantic piece of prog-thrash and keyboard solos galore. On the other, it has light melodic sections that you could wave a lighter to. Without the balance between the two, each of these ideas may have felt less startling than they do.\n\nScenes from a Memory's perfect sense of flow brings each one of the songs to another level. I think a large part of this strong structure has the album's concept to thank for it. The implications on psychology and spirituality this album offers could deserve their own essays. Suffice to say, the multi-faceted (and arguably open-ended) concept behind the album breathes a lot of thought-provoking depth into already engaging music. The idea of looking into one's past lives, only to have the events of past lives come to bear on your current incarnation is something that really got under my skin when I was younger, and it has much of that same effect now. I've never relied on Dream Theater for strong lyrics, and I suppose some of the lyrical decisions here could raise a cynical brow, but the way the story is told feels organic and consistently clever. Scenes from a Memory was one of the very few concept records I've heard (alongside Operation Mindcrime) that managed to be incredibly in-depth and complex while still being easy-to-follow as a listener. To date, this is still the go-to standard by which I judge all over concept albums. Even the masters of the 1970s never felt quite so coherent as this.\n\nI guess if I were to be nitpicky about Scenes from a Memory, I'd certainly bring up the feeling that certain songs tower over others. Especially hearing it now as a cynical adult, the instrumental bite of \"Fatal Tragedy\" and \"The Dance of Eternity\" appeal to me loads more than the potentially cloying \"Through Her Eyes\" and the AOR power balladry of \"One Last Time\". With that said, all of the ingredients here are painted in such a way that they benefit the larger scope. A truly comprehensive journey is not without its softer notes. If anything about Scenes from a Memory really hurt Dream Theater in the long run, it's that they never seemed to be able to bring their vision to the same heights again. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence may have been the closest, but that's an album I never seem to be able to have a single, stable opinion about. And if their self-titled shitpile and The Astonishing tell accurately, it's very unlikely we'll see another slice of perfection like this from them again. For all it is worth, I am so, so glad I heard Scenes from a Memory so early on in life. It's never going to be an album I'm ever more than a few months away from hearing. If it hasn't begun to wear out for me yet, I can't imagine it ever will.\n",
        "\nMy relationship with Dream Theater reminds me a lot of the saddest scenes from the Toy Story movies. I still remember the day, over half a lifetime ago (!!!) that my first copy of Scenes from a Memory came in the mail. The package hadn't come a moment too soon, arriving on the day of my elementary school's graduation ceremony, a triviality I happily skipped in order to free up precious hours I could spend with the album. Even as a child I quickly developed strong opinions towards each of Dream Theater's other albums as I heard them. Images & Words and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence stirred me almost as much as SFAM, while I was left hanging dry by Awake and Train of Thought. Even if I wasn't always sold all the time by Dream Theater, alongside Led Zeppelin and Yngwie Malmsteen they were arguably the biggest musical influences on me before turning 12.\n\nLike Toy Story however, the enthusiasm wasn't permanent. It's never that I bought into the popular opinion that Dream Theater are \"wankers\", nor did the heavyhanded cheese wear on me. I wouldn't even say I necessarily grew out of them; rather, it was just a case of gradually opening myself to more extreme and fascinating sounds. Like childhood toys, they quietly faded into memory. However, even as bands like Opeth and later Deathspell Omega and Blut aus Nord expanded my vision of what progressive metal could be, I never lost a love for them. Whenever I heard of a new album coming out, I would light up with excitement. I would feel like a kid again. I defended Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds & Silver Linings from less enthusiastic fans, and shared the joy when they returned to roots on A Dramatic Turn of Events.\n\nIt wasn't until 2013 when my opinion finally took a sour turn. Their self-titled album was the first time I felt they had released a piece of dogshit. Even if a few songs on it shined, it was finally enough to convince me that Dream Theater was finished as a creative act. Slogs like \"Illumination Theory\" were enough to sap my anticipation for future records. That's a good part of the reason why I'm reviewing The Astonishing in early October, as opposed to January when it was released. Is it possible to feel reinvigorated and simultaneously let down by a band with a single album? In most cases I'd say the answer is no, but when a consummate \"has been\" band tries to pull out all the stops, supposedly creating the most ambitious work of their career, strange things are bound to happen.\n\nOn the one hand, I'm happy that Dream Theater have reclaimed some of their energy they most certainly lacked in 2013. Some of the best prog instrumentation they've put out in years is here. James LaBrie hasn't sounded this powerful as a vocalist arguably since Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Even its mere stance as a concept album implies they're trying to make another Scenes from a Memory. There's some of the liveliest music I've heard from Dream Theater in a long, long time. On the other hand, they've somehow managed to lop off the buzz with a mind-numbing amount of filler and the most clich\u00e9d, idiotic and self-absorbed concept I've ever seen set to music. I guess hearing quality Dream Theater material without having to wade in shit would have been too simple, and not \"progressive\" enough for them, right?\n\nI know The Astonishing is hammy and self-involved from start to finish; I can't help but love certain things about it however. At its very best, it comes across as a spry continuation of the bright prog they revived on A Dramatic Turn of Events, blown up considerably with symphonic orchestration and sprawling structure. Ignore the lyrics to \"The Gift of Music\" and \"A New Beginning\" for a second, and focus on what they're doing with the music. The busy interplay and effortless finesse is nothing new for them, but it can certainly feel that way in light of their last album. A lot of Dream Theater's detractors brush them off on the charge of wankery, but that polished technicality is easily the most exciting thing about them here. I don't think it's ever been the amount of notes that Dream Theater plays that have set many listeners against them; it's the way they fall short when they opt for other approaches.\n\nLamentably, The Astonishing is pretty chock-full of these \"other approaches\". Even if it's easily the most bombastic album these guys have ever put out, it's also probably the softest album note-for-note. The technical prog-outs are as impressive as ever, but their ballads post-Kevin Moore have always been hit-or-miss. Many of the 34 tracks take the shape of piano interludes and lilting vocals. Don't you get it? Dream Theater aren't trying to be badass here, they're trying to make you feel your feelings! Not that I haven't been struck emotionally by DT in the past, but whenever they did so, it was an authentic by-product of the band capitalizing on their strengths. Here, you can tell they set out specifically to tug on your heartstrings. Given the album's faux-dystopian concept revolves around the spiritual power of music I suppose it makes sense, but the dry kind of hammy superemotion expressed here almost serves to work against that thesis.\n\nThe biggest standout talent this time around is easily James LaBrie. Surprisingly, a lot of fans seem to agree. I've always loved his voice (despite understanding why others do not) but he sounds particularly passionate and confident as a vocalist. His stepping up to the plate could not have happened on a more fitting album. The Astonishing is a very vocal-driven album. I don't think there's any salvation for the plot or lyrics, but for what it's worth, the melodies and performance almost make the whole thing work. It's all the more impressive to hear James adopt different voices for each of the personae in this story. This ability to characterize his voice is something any fan who has heard their covers knows full well, and it's refreshing to hear this talent put to use on original material.\n\nAlthough Dream Theater have given their detractors plenty of extra justification to hate them with this album, I'd honestly say a lot of the music is solid. A near-hour of this stuff could have been cut and the album would be no worse for well, but I get that they weren't trying to make a normal album with The Astonishing, and I can respect it as such. The only unforgivable aspect here are the lyrics and general concept. Falling somewhere between a mindless ape of 2112 and terrible Young Adult dystopian fiction, The Astonishing supposedly tells the story of an evil empire and a band of rebels who resist them using, uh, music? I get the basic idea they're digging up here, but I couldn't help but think of a battle where soldiers are popping up from trenches and shooting at other with riffs. Okay, so music enlivens the spirit, and creates e-m-o-t-i-o-n. Evil empires don't like emotion, apparently. I guess Dream Theater wanted to make a soundtrack to the film Equilibrium, instead where they take out all of the cool martial arts gunplay and replace it with fucking piano ballads. That's nothing to say about the moronic cast of characters. A rebellious girl named Faythe? An evil leader called Nafaryus? Pour a load of venomous earwigs into my hearing holes and end me now.\n\nThere are times where it reads like very bad Star Wars fanfiction, and even then that is giving it too much credit. I have a soft spot for self-absorbed rock opera concepts (see: Ayreon, Rhapsody of Fire) but The Astonishing sounds like a corporate-sponsored amalgamation of all the most predictable tropes coming together into a single, amorphous shitpile of irrelevance. Insult is added to injury when you consider how great the conceptual angle has worked out for them in the past. Scenes from a Memory is arguably my favourite album concept ever, where clever lyrics unfolded a mindbending concept that still leaves me in awe. So it took them less than two decades to shed that brilliance completely in favour of a microwaved casserole 2112? Lyrics aren't everything, to be sure, but with the weight the album's marketing placed on the hokey concept, it's almost unbelievable they allowed something like this to mar otherwise solid music.\n\nIt's incredibly easy to criticize The Astonishing. Dream Theater haters could have a field day with this one like none other in the past. My job of reviewing this album would be a tad simpler if I could simply dislike it. But when you look past the trite concept, the filler interludes and ballad material, the saccharine bombast and ridiculous length (and it is possible to look past all of that, sort of) there's some of Dream Theater's most exciting material in a long time waiting. Of course, all but the band's biggest fans won't have the patience to get to the good stuff. Maybe in a few years they can release a \"Greatest Hits from The Astonishing\" EP and call it a day?\n",
        "\nI haven't reviewed any Dream Theater albums so far, not because I don't care about the band or haven't actually got any albums, but more because - as a stubborn Englishman - it's taken me a long time to mentally prepare myself for misspelling \"theatre\" a dozen or so times during the review. As such, I'll try to stick to DT for everyone's sake. There's also another reason that I haven't reviewed any DT albums as yet, and that's because the band's music isn't exactly to my taste. I tend to find some of the earlier DT albums a bit wishy-washy and inconsequential, which is my personal reaction to them being classically \"proggy\", something that I don't have a great deal of time for. Also, my sister likes DT, my sister being the barometer for anything that is too cheesy or pompous for normal people to enjoy in a normal way.\n\nAll that aside, Black Clouds & Silver Linings agrees with me more than almost any other DT album you'd care to mention, though I'm also somewhat partial to the heavier offerings Train of Thought and Systematic Chaos. The 2009 effort currently on the dissection table bears that \"heavier\" stamp as well and in my view benefits a lot from it, sounding commanding and puropseful with the weight of John Petrucci's guitar thundering out some big riffs in 'A Nightmare to Remember', 'A Rite of Passage', and 'The Shattered Fortress', which looks to take Opeth on at their own game (a game Opeth have now lost if one cares to remember). The heaviness comes in part from the guitar tone, which is bold and fat though with plenty of classic appeal; there is also an effort to riff in a decidedly metal way, as can be seen from the (downtuned?) no shit riff that greets the listener after an atmospheric introduction to 'A Nightmare to Remember', plus a full-on double bass stormer as James LaBrie spits out a three-quarters death grunt after a particularly masculine verse late on in the song. In the same vein, the heaviness of some of the instrumental passages keeps things energetic between verses, which is especially important when trying to maintain attention during 16 or even 19 minute songs.\n\nIt's a testament to DT's impressive planning and interesting musical ideas that those lengthy songs don't become testing experiences, because I don't find myself drifting off or growing restless during 'A Nightmare to Remember' nor 'The Count of Tuscany', which certainly happens to me during other DT albums like Awake (I guess it was named ironically). Indeed, both of those songs must go down as some of the best exercises in extended songwriting and storytelling that I can think of, since the plot of LaBrie's lyrics is as gripping as you would hope, particularly in the closer, where you wait a good 5 minutes through an instrumental break to find the conclusion of the story, the other four musicians keeping the suspense alive the whole time. There are a lot of memorable moments in those instrumental sections too, what with the great keyboard theme to the opener, the excellent guitar and keyboard solos in 'A Rite of Passage', and the consistently diverting and atmospheric closer. I could go on for a long time about the qualities of these songs, but let a single example suffice: I once had a dream in which I played through the entirety of 'The Count of Tuscany' in my mind and I'm pretty sure every section was present - it's certainly a memorable listen.\n\nAll of the musicians are important to creating the greatness of those songs, but James LaBrie deserves a special mention. It's natural to assume the skill of the instrumental members given their pedigree, though LaBrie has often been the weak link in the band, sounding a little tired or too plaintive to fully convince. Here, he has more powerful backing to work with, which helps him a lot, though he also pulls out some great changes and immensely powerful performances, the pinnacle of which is that unexpectedly heavy part of 'A Nightmare to Remember' alongside the electric chorus of 'The Shattered Fortress'. That said, there are moments where he still struggles, such as on the ballad 'Wither', which my sister wouldn't bat an eyelid at but I have quite a problem with, emotional overblowness and all that. The same thing happens for large parts of 'The Best of Times', the lyrical sentiment being really unsubtle and overdone:\n\nThank you for the inspiration\nThank you for the smiles\nAll the unconditional love\nthat carried me for miles\nIt carried me for miles\nBut most of all, thank you for my life.\n\nThis is only made worse by LaBrie singing in this kind of lame \"I'm opening my soul\" way, though the instrumental sections are alright, the closing melodic solo helping to eradicate the nasty taste in my mouth.\n\nThose less tasty aspects of DT must be expected to some degree I suppose, it's just a shame that it leaves the album unbalanced, since the best songs (the other four) are all really good. The softer songs could have done with less overbearing emotion, thus providing a respite from the heaviness elsewhere, though I know there are people who will lap up that kind of Broadway obviousness. As such, making a judgment on Black Clouds & Silver Linings is rather difficult, because there's a clear hour of great music, which could have made an album on its own and been gripping from start to finish. I heartily recommend having a listen, but only if you know what to expect of Dream Theater: complex and captivating instrumental ideas, nasty ballads, and American spelling.\n",
        "\nHuh, well I didn't expect to hate this but I bought this album solely out of some sense of duty, some sense of \"I guess I oughta figure out what this prog deal is about\". It's the same reason why I have a bunch of Beatles and Cure records, basically- bands which I have some sort of \"respect them for their influence\" vibe, but otherwise I could comfortably count on one hand the songs that I properly enjoy. Thankfully I've gotten a bit more out of this album than White Album or Revolverlution or Sgt.Peppermint's Singles in Your Area band or whatever.\n\nYeah, there's a lot I like about this album and I find myself spinning it often. As with, well, as with a lot of metal in general there's a few cheesy elements that need to be stomached in order to get the most out of Images & Words- a few somewhat corny lines from LaBrie, a few early 90s synth tones, a saxophone, but when you get the handle on that stuff the songs are generally pretty great, a neat mashup of Fates Warningisms, a bunch of fusion and even some funk thrown together in a fairly agreeable fashion. Take the Time is a personal favourite; some pretty great soaring vocals, about 50 rather interesting guitar lines, a lot of good keyboard parts, that intangible quality of being \"taken on a journey\" which is what all the best prog does- getting taken somewhere by a group of particularly dedicated musicians. The tunes change direction pretty often but there's this real sense of coherence amongst the riffs, proggy pianolating and the surprisingly muscular drum performance that keep this thing from falling apart.\n\nA lot of it is driven by the vocals really, so credit where credit's due. LaBrie often goes fairly high, yeah, but I find him to be far more expressive and wide ranging than Arch's approach, to pick another fairly influential example, and he rarely gets on my nerves with his tone. That huge, oddly Blind Guardian-ish chorus on Pull Me Under, for example- man, it's earworms like that that separates this album from a lot of other prog albums that I've heard twice, forgotten, and deleted off my computer. He comes up with catchy lines, doesn't overstay his welcome, and is extremely good on his chosen instrument.\n\nSpeaking of being \"good on his chosen instrument\", let's digress briefly into how DT's much vaunted instrumental skill is used here. Now, technicality isn't a good thing in and of itself- it's no different to being a good roof plumber, or being handy with a lathe. It's about what you can create using the skillset, and that's what Dream Theater manage so well. Like many a good tech-y album, you don't entirely realize how hard it is to play until you download the tab. It's a good quality, I reckon; like most people I like to have a sense that the band is good on their instruments, but I don't want to get wanked on, and this album's a pretty great example. Sure it's wanky if you're comparing to, say, Discharge, but compared to Yngwie or Speed Metal Symphony or whatever the thing is positively spartan. \n\nYeah, there's this sense throughout that the band is enjoying what they're doing, and there's an approach that's more about writing a sweet ass song as opposed to \"how many different chords can we fit in a tune\". Highly recommended to anyone, like me, who is interested in knowing a bit more about the whole prog metal thing; I figure everyone else already has this.\n",
        "\nThe Astonishing has been getting mixed reviews since it came out, which doesn't surprise me \u2013 it's perhaps the most audacious and ambitious work Dream Theater has ever put out. But then, the band has never been one to rest on its laurels. Even in the later 2000s when their sound appeared to be smoothing out into a more formulaic waters with albums like Black Clouds and Silver Linings, they always found ways to make each album stand out and never repeated themselves, blending pop, rock and prog influences with hard-hitting metal to create an idiosyncratic sound. This one, an over-two-hour musical opera concept album, was never going to be one to please every listener. I think it's a pretty brilliant work though.\n\nThis is just a tremendous, ambitious work. The production is beautifully full and the instrumentation is, as expected, spot-on \u2013 but somewhat more agile and ready than what I remember of their other recent works, making them sound about a decade younger than they are. Dream Theater haven't sounded this inspired in years, frankly \u2013 even singer James LaBrie turns in an impassioned performance, with his nasal whine in about the best form it can be these days. I think he really delivers here. He does voice every character in the story the album tells, but frankly, I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. Having a death metal growler, a female operatic singer and who knows who else would've just cluttered the album up. LaBrie's voice being front and center lends a familiarity to the proceedings that I feel it needed, rather than having this turn into some sort of Ayreon-style thing.\n\nRather than focus on individual hard-hitting, catchy songs, the album flows seamlessly from one piece to the next \u2013 from rhythmic prog guitar crunching to poignant piano balladry and everything in-between. There is really no halfway with the songwriting here \u2013 it's an unapologetic, full-on musical journey, played out for the two-hour runtime with no breaks. It isn't for people with short attention spans, which I think will probably be the album's doing-in in the end \u2013 most people just won't listen to it, even if only because they don't have the time to do so. Two hours is a pretty long time.\n\nBut for those who do have the time, there's quite a bit of good stuff to be found here, from the Rush-imitative burst of energy \u201cThe Gift Of Music,\u201d the stirring \u201cA Better Life\u201d and the album's most progressive moments in the theatrical \u201cBrother, Can You Hear Me?\u201d and its companion, the hugely emotive \u201cA Life Left Behind.\u201d Instrumental \"Dystopian Overture\" comes to life with vivid, colorful instrumentation - a great song. The second disc is a bit more thrifty in its time spent, with the frenetic, busy prog of \u201cMoment Of Betrayal,\u201d the atmospheric \u201cHeaven's Cove\u201d with its slow build and the garroting \u201cThe Walking Shadow,\u201d which is one of the heavier, more metallic moments in an album that, frankly, isn't really much of a metal album beyond a few isolated parts.\n\nI think the effort and passion in this album is huge and comes through fully \u2013 this is not a sterile intellectual exercise, but a vibrant and full storytelling experience the same way a movie or a play would be. It's unfortunate that the story and lyrics are so silly (Lord Nafaryus is the name of the villain \u2013 really?), but the music makes up for that by being completely serious and articulately detailed \u2013 this whole thing is, sonically, a pleasure to hear. The band obviously put their whole selves into this work, and I think it shows and is better for it.\n\nPerhaps there's a bit too much slow, Lifetime Movie-esque balladry going on, to the point where some of the vocal lines and melodic cues start to sound alike after a while \u2013 especially near the end of Disc 1. But a lot of the ballads are extremely well written and earnestly performed, avoiding kitsch and instead coming off as heartfelt. It might be sappy, but it's a genuine sappiness, and doesn't come off as pandering or fake.\n\nThe Astonishing probably didn't need to be as long as it is to work \u2013 it would certainly be easier to take in with a shorter runtime. But it works well as it is, too. This is, surprisingly, one of the more palatable and easy to listen to Dream Theater albums \u2013 certainly compared to the sometimes directionless meandering of Train of Thought or Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, this comes off as more focused, and the shorter song lengths work in the band's favor.\n\nI might not be in the mood for this all the time, but it's a very impressive work from a veteran band. It's a hugely ambitious album and for those who want something that goes a step beyond what you'd normally expect, it's a good choice and worth hearing. Dream Theater is still relevant as a prog band. This album proves they've got life left in their engines yet.\n",
        "\nAnyone who knows me for long will know of my enduring and absolute adoration for Dream Theater\u2019s first three albums and their grandiose, brilliant, massively overblown yet infectiously catchy blend of classic \u201880s power metal and classic \u201870s prog rock. Those three will probably be desert island albums for me as long as I live. James LaBrie\u2019s fiery power metal belting and Kevin Moore\u2019s shimmering synth work will be burned into my brain for eternity. However, this is not one of those albums. Today, I have come not to praise Dream Theater, but to bury them.\n\nThe Astonishing is neither progressive rock nor power metal, nor even the tedious Wacken festival metal that replaced the USPM in their sound in later years. This is sappy, treacly, sticky AOR like you might find in a waiting room (but the bands on your local waiting room\u2019s soft-rock station do it much better than this), with the majority of the running time devoted to piano ballads. And boy, do these ballads suck. Jordan Rudess is a Juilliard-trained pianist, but it doesn\u2019t show here\u2014his piano lines are sub-Elton-John schmaltz, plonking in the left hand, tinkling in the right, playing memorable melodies with neither. Piano dentistry (to repurpose a phrase from critic George Starostin) is what this is\u2014mechanical, repetitive tedium occasionally interrupted with moments of nearly unbearable agony. His garish \u201corchestrations\u201d are no better, all soppy film soundtrack strings and fruity neo-Baroque hornpipe fanfares. I pity Mike Mangini; it must suck replacing notorious martinet Mike Portnoy and not only getting nowhere near the respect and authority Portnoy commanded, but being left out of songwriting sessions and not even allowed to play on half the album because of the relentless onslaught of balladry. When he does play, it\u2019s nothing special. He projects no personality or individual style whatsoever, obediently keeping time. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s impossible to write decent AOR-based prog rock either. Dream Theater themselves did it on the first side of Images and Words, serving up two heartfelt ballads in \u201cAnother Day\u201d and \u201cSurrounded\u201d. Those were passionate and energetic, and Kevin Moore\u2019s piano work served as an endless stream of powerful melodies and rich textures. Eloy\u2019s 1994 comeback The Tides Return Forever is nearly all prog-AOR, and is a perfectly serviceable album with great hooks, and that one did it despite having a marginal singer with a German accent thick enough to be a speech impediment. The Astonishing, for all its Broadway melodrama and \u201cemotional\u201d songwriting, is soulless. For an album that pretends to be a parable of the centrality of human beings and human feelings to art, the actual music sounds like a product of one of the \u201cNOMAC\u201d robots depicted in the story\u2014a computer calculating the optimal way to tug the heartstrings of credulous hew-mons.\n\nOh yeah, the concept. This pulsating, cancerous mass of bad ideas has displaced the actual music as the core of this album, being heavily featured in the awful, awful, no good, very bad promotional material that preceded the album\u2019s release, with maps and character bios and other ancillary bullshit you\u2019d expect from a Japanese anime-themed RPG. At least the lyrics on their early albums, while being completely meaningless, at least sounded vaguely cool, projecting weird fantasy imagery with deliberately obscure language and letting the listener\u2019s imagination fill in the details. If Dream Theater wrote \u201cThe Killing Hand\u201d from their first album today, there would be a 30-page short story about the history of the titular Killing Hand and the country that he rules, some Killing Hand merch, Killing Hand desktop wallpapers, and maybe an animated narrative music video produced by a Malaysian sweatshop, and no one, no one, with an ounce of self-respect would ever consume any of it.\n\nAnd as well as being soulless, dishonest, treacly, goopy, and infested with terrible ballads, this album is long. There are around thirty tracks (not including the occasional burst of Skrillex-like ambient noise/dubstep that comes out of nowhere and disappears just as quickly), all of mostly similar lengths and generally homogenous composition. The total running time comes out to over two hours and ten minutes, and believe me, it will be the longest 130 minutes of your life. Structureless balladic non-songs come and go, spewing trite chord progressions and the occasional plodding, chugging downtuned guitar riff that relates to nothing and resolves to nothing. Overture-like things cycle through numerous unrelated themes with no logical transitions or any sense that these abominations were even composed rather than being hastily stitched together from rejected opening themes from previous songs and albums. It is mostly futile to try to distinguish many of them; especially on a particularly dire stretch in the middle of the first disc, the ballads run into each other and you start to feel like you\u2019re drowning in an endless sea of melted sugar.\n\nOn the occasions where the band does wake up and start actually playing together, the \u201cheavy\u201d riffs are almost impossibly enervated, wallowing like a teenaged boy refusing to get up and go to school. Solos are rare, perfunctory, and largely unimpressive both technically and musically. People like to complain about intrusive \u201cwankery\u201d in Dream Theater\u2019s music, but a long, winding noodly prog hoedown in this album would serve as a sorely needed relief from the melodramatic vocal and piano horseshit. Here John Petrucci grinds out some basic Guitar Center arpeggios like he\u2019s passing a rock-hard, fist-sized morphine shit and Jordan Rudess listlessly responds with a squealy fourth-year-student synth lead platitude (how does he manage to stay awake?) and then the band collapses in defeat. And normally at some point in a Dream Theater album John Myung plays some tricky bass thing to remind the audience that he exists, but not here. He might as well have not shown up to the studio sessions\u2014no one would ever know the difference.\n\nSo with the band essentially comatose, a massive burden falls on James LaBrie and his singing voice to do something, anything, to move the album along. But it\u2019s not 1993 again and his worn old pipes aren\u2019t getting any younger, and it would be a Sisyphean task to save this dross anyway, so mostly he follows the path of least resistance and falls back on soft-rock clich\u00e9s\u2014the breathiness, always his biggest vice as a singer, is absolutely out of control here and his tone sometimes threatens to dissolve altogether into a hoarse whisper. Occasionally he attempts to affect a different tone to portray some of the story\u2019s different characters, particularly the ludicrous, cackling antagonist \u201cLord Nafaryus\u201d (I\u2019m not kidding), where he goes for a Harry Conklin-like sneer but mostly sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball.\n\nFew of the tracks on this album rise to the level of being worthy of the title \u201csong\u201d, but the few that do wouldn\u2019t have made it past the demo stage on the Octavarium or Systematic Chaos sessions (to say nothing of the glory days of the early \u201890s, where none of this garbage would have even been conceived at all). First up is the lead single \u201cThe Gift of Music\u201d, a tired Rush derivation that sounds like \u201cThe Trees\u201d on Valium combined with the lyrical banality of \u201cPresentation\u201d and a shitty Flower Kings piano diarrhea splatter for a pre-chorus to add an additional shot of empty sentimentality. One thing it doesn\u2019t sound like is Dream Theater, but neither does much else on this album. John Petrucci\u2019s solo here is well above average for the album, which means it\u2019s about 10% as good as what is normally expected of him.\n\n\u201cAct of Faythe\u201d earns attention for sheer comedy value\u2014like the sort of thing that might have played on The Simpsons when Homer undergoes some dreadful circumstance that imparts an Important Life Lesson that is milked for all the faux pathos it\u2019s worth. It rides on the back of a pitiful maudlin minor-key string nothing and empty piano tinkling, eventually joined by vacuous backing guitar chords and a stock backbeat. James LaBrie gives the hands-down worst singing performance of his entire career, squeaking into the mic in a frightening teenage girl impression, outrushing breath overwhelming his feeble vocalizations. When I heard this I crumpled in my chair from laughing, it is so transparent, so cack-handed, so utterly incompetent at evoking an emotional reaction from the audience.\n\nThe album\u2019s only lengthy song, \u201cA New Beginning\u201d is the only composition on this album that sounds like a Dream Theater song. It too is saddled with gross Baroque vulgarities, risible character impressions from LaBrie, and occasional interjections of piano dentistry, but it has a modicum of energy, actual bona fide metal riffs, and a few Yes-like prog rock melodies that manage to be mildly catchy. The bridge gets up off its ass and hauls, with frantic Hammond organ dueling with raging shred guitar leading up to a cathartic unison and an atmospheric bass-led groove section (so John Myung is alive after all!) that manages to have a real sense of swing (and is the one moment where Mangini proves to be better at something than Mike Portnoy\u2014Portnoy would have ejaculated fills and clever little drumming devices all over this section and ruined the flow, whereas Mangini just keeps the groove rolling). If the entire album were composed like this, I\u2019d give it a 60% rating and say it\u2019s a bland retread of past Dream Theater glories\u2014but it\u2019s still an actual signature Dream Theater song, and in this company it\u2019s a drink of clear, pure, cold water in the middle of a desert. It also saves this album\u2014barely\u2014from a zero rating.\n\nOur final genuine song of the album is \u201cLosing Faythe\u201d, which returns to comedy territory (the character and unintentional bathos seem to go hand in hand). So our hero\u2019s girlfriend got unceremoniously killed off in the previous track (the unspeakably obscene \u201cMy Last Farewell\u201d\u2014I think the title alone should be sufficient to dissuade non-masochists from exploring further). This song is a horrific rehash of the lighter-waving religious anthem \u201cThe Spirit Carries On\u201d off 1999\u2019s Scenes from a Memory, a song which already danced on the razor\u2019s edge between touching balladry and self-parody, but this version falls clear over the edge into the darkest pits of humiliating silliness. It begins with some blatantly fake weeping (think the end of Anthrax\u2019s viciously satirical \u201cN.F.B. (Dallabnikufesin)\u201d, but this takes itself entirely seriously!), and sounds like something some sensitive-guy \u201890s Christian rock band would play in a coffee shop: \u201cinspirational\u201d garbage lyrics about the villain\u2019s miraculous redemption with fucking atrocious puns (puns!) on the deceased Faythe\u2019s name, delivered in a counterfeit Chris Cornell howl, oozing with slimy sentimentality, backed by the regimented plonk of Rudess\u2019 dentistry and mindless atonal bloops from Petrucci\u2019s guitar. The solo is dogshit, a cheap, slow-moving melody any beginner could come up with that lasts for all of ten seconds or so before its merciful euthanasia.\n\nI suppose that\u2019s supposed to serve as the climax of this shit sandwich of an album, much like it\u2019s vastly superior forebear served as the high water mark for Scenes from a Memory, but \u201cLosing Faythe\u201d is such a consummate failure that it fails to provide any sort of resolution, either story-wise (apparently Nafaryus\u2014*stifled giggles*\u2014is instantly forgiven after he accepts Our Lord Jesus and his heart grows three sizes and never has to accept responsibility for anything?) or musically\u2014the closing few tracks are a confused mess of jumbled themes regurgitated from earlier in the album that go nowhere and accomplish nothing. The album grinds to a halt and dies, its shambling hulk smashing itself to bits as it clatters to the floor.\n\nThe same, one hopes, will happen to Dream Theater\u2019s career, to spare the boys from Long Island the indignity of having to continue on with this smoking, gaping hole blasted in their legacy. Not that I\u2019m holding my breath\u2014this self-indulgent, tragicomic farce seems to be doing quite well with critics despite its musical and artistic worthlessness and total lack of any connection to what made this band a vital and creative force many years ago. This hurts me. It hurts to listen to this album it hurts to write about this album, it hurts to finally be forced to accept that a once-unstoppable prog metal juggernaut, a band I once called my favorite, is finally, irrevocably dead as a creative force. This album gets 2% for \u201cA New Beginning\u201d, otherwise it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. If you like Dream Theater, if you like progressive music, if you like music in general that has heart and integrity and human feelings put into it, stay the hell away. Dream Theater is dead.\n\nKiller Tracks: \u201cA New Beginning\u201d is listenable, I guess.\n",
        "\n''The Astonishing'' is Dream Theater's most ambitious record ever but turns out to be the quintet's most disappointing release. Fan reactions are quite divergent over this controversial output. When I assisted one of the concerts where the band only played this album in its entirety, I saw some fans disguised as characters from this conceptual record who were quietly enjoying the show as if they were assisting an opera or theater play while others left in the middle of the show or shouted comments like ''You can do better than that!'', ''Play Pull Me Under!'' and ''Trial of Tears, please!''. While the concert was much more interesting than the studio record due to its better instrumental sound, colorful animations and vivid light show, the truth about this album lies in between both the negative and the positive points of view in my book.\n\nLet's start with the negatives first. ''The Astonishing'' is artificially stretched to a length of far over two hours including thirty-four songs and offers quantity over quality. The same story could have been told in a much more consistent way in only one hour if the band had cut in its endless instrumental passages, multiple overtures and numerous codas and especially in the short instrumentals that try to portray what electronic music could sound like in a dystopian world in a biased, cringe-worthy and repetitive way. Even as a fan of progressive music and more complex records, this album is at times hard to sit through. The production of the album is another issue. While all the instrumentals were perfectly audible in concert, the studio album is overtly dominated by keyboard sounds and vocals. The guitar play sound generic and weak at times and the rhythm section has no shining moments throughout the entire record. Both drums and bass sounds are underused on this album which is probably due to the fact that these musicians weren't involved at all in the song writing which was a bad decision. If you expect a progressive band to develop diversified songs where different musicians have their shining moments, you got it all wrong here. Consistency is the key word here to provide a guiding line but over the course of far over two hours of music, this lack of diversity leads to unspectacular boredom. The most significant problem is the fact that half of the album consists of exchangeable ballads dominated by fluffy keyboard sounds and fragile vocals where the singer is mostly breathing his soul out instead of actually hitting notes. Most of this album is neither progressive nor metal music. If the ballads were sung by a woman instead of a man, they wouldn't be a far call from Adele to give you a precise idea but as much as I respect James LaBrie, his vocal skills aren't unique enough to carry this album alone. This leads us to another bad decision made by the song writers in the band. The story revolves around eight main characters including women and a child and a few side characters and they are all portrayed by one singer. James LaBrie is a diversified performer but he doesn't manage to offer eight distinctive styles to distinguish the different characters. Without the booklet, it's impossible to hear which character is speaking or singing in the story which is very confusing. The band should have chosen different guest singers, at least for the female and child characters. When asked why he didn't try out something like Avantasia with its numerous guests, main song writer John Petrucci said he didn't even know what Avantasia was. This is a classic example of a so-called progressive rock musician who is rather regressive and only knows the usual classics but nothing about inspiring contemporary projects. Even if we compare this album to the classics, it can't mess with conceptual records by King Crimson, Rush, Yes and the likes even if some band members and critics seem to think otherwise.\n\nThere are also a few positives concerning this record. First of all, the concept and story are an intriguing modern fairy tale that may be predictable at some points yet enjoyably entertaining. The cover artwork and the booklet only add to the intriguing story and it's always obvious that the song writers put a great deal of passion, intellect and creativity inside this project. This album is definitely Jordan Rudess' personal masterpiece. His work was never as diversified, dominating and inspiring as on this album. If you enjoy keyboards and pianos or are playing these instruments, you should definitely own this album. While the electric guitar play is surprisingly lackluster, the record includes many harmonious acoustic guitar parts which is rather unusual but very interesting for the band. Even though James LaBrie isn't able to use eight different vocal styles, his work on this record is still excellent, emotional and motivated. It may be one of his greatest career performances as well. The song where his diversified vocal abilities work best is the enchanting ''Ravenskill''. While the album includes too many exchangeable slow-paced ballads, there are also a few tracks that try to break new ground. ''Three Days'' is one of the most vivid tracks of the record and includes a joyful swing passage that could play in a saloon. ''The X Aspect'' is the first Dream Theater track to include bagpipes and they blend in very well and add some epic melancholy to the story. The dramatic and diversified ''The Path That Divides'' includes some sword-fighting samples that lead to a truly cinematic experience reminding me of the Game of Thrones series and the likes. Aside from these new experiments, Dream Theater also offers some convincing classic tracks. The dynamic ''Dystopian Overture'' is probably the band's most ambitious and entertaining instrumental since ''The Dance of Eternity'' seventeen years earlier. ''The Gift of Music'' has somewhat cheesy lyrics but is the record's catchiest track and offers some memorable melodies. The closing title song ''Astonishing'' offers an epic conclusion with flutes and trumpets that ends an average album on a reconciliatory note reminding me of the two last scenes from the band's previous conceptual output Metropolis Part Two: Scenes from a Memory. Let's also mention that after a strong start and an overlong, disappointing middle section, the rising action and resolution of the story are rather good. Overall, the second act is more fluid and pardons somewhat for an exhausting first act.\n\nIn the end, the good and negative elements are rather balanced on this album but if compared to Dream Theater's stunning discography, this album is definitely the group's most disappointing record and suffers from its own ambitions. Instead of buying this album, I would really recommend you to catch the band on one of its concerts supporting this release. The visual elements complement the music extremely well and this fusion offers a high-quality experience for your ears and eyes if you are open to assist a more intellectually driven concert instead of a metal show. If you can't catch the band on one of its current live shows, cross your fingers and hope for an already highly recommendable live release of this experience. Finally, I hope that the band's next record will be much heavier and more modern again since ''The Astonishing'' includes enough ballads and retro sounds for the next three releases together and I'm not even exaggerating here.\n",
        "\nThe cinematic, extravagant metal album of the year 1999, the close of the century.\n\nIt's hard enough to create just one new paradigm of progressive, heavy music...but two?\n\nInterestingly enough, Scenes From A Memory would not have happened without the difficulties of the prog metal giants' previous record to this, 1997's Falling Into Infinity. On that record, there was stressful label interference and a generally difficult writing and recording process. Among other things, it meant that shorter, more accessible songs would be the focus, at the expense of longer tracks. Clearly, the suits believed nobody liked progressive music anymore because everyone has ADD. Some things never change.\n\nOne of those \"it's too long, scrap it\" tracks that didn't make the cut for Falling Into Infinity was \"Metropolis, Pt. 2.\"\n\nIn hindsight, all that was a good thing--because the song was given time and attention from this phenomenal group of musicians to be expanded into its own album. Dream Theater had also located and hired keyboardist Jordan Rudess, who had the formidable task of standing toe-to-toe with John Petrucci in musical duel. Of course, he is now considered one of the world's premiere keyboardists.\n\nMetropolis Part 2 is the story of Nick, whose visit to a therapist to get to the bottom of some strange dreams he's been having turns into an adventure through time and the human heart. Dream Theater, the \"Orchestra of Witnesses,\" provides the soundtrack to Nick's journey of salvation.\n\nAs Nick's therapist counts down to \"Regression,\" we are invited into another world, where the murder of a young girl in Paris in 1928 reverberates 70 years later to affect the dreams of one man. We are about to embark on something beautiful, so you \"take a deep breath and let it out slowly\"...the overture introduces quick takes of the album's many highlights, a reference point of sorts. The first time I heard it, Dream Theater's \"Overture 1928\" reminded me of the Jurassic Park soundtrack for the sweep and grandeur of its melody.\n\nIt turns out that Nick's constantly-recurring dream means that he was someone else in a past life, someone who is deeply linked to him...a young woman named Victoria, who was apparently murdered by her jealous lover before he tragically turned the weapon on himself. But by looking \"through her eyes,\" Nick is beginning to sense that the pieces fit together just too neatly to be believable...\n\nThe Orchestra of Witnesses has a command of memorable melodic hooks and wondrous technicality that its members are able to balance perfectly on this record. \"Strange Deja Vu\" is one of the album's more poignant pop points demonstrating this balance, in which James LaBrie sings both the male and female parts--a testament to the strength of his range. The band's wild interplay starts in earnest on \"Fatal Tragedy\" and reaches its zenith on \"Dance of Eternity,\" where every instrument takes a turn in a thrilling display.\n\nSo adept is this band at moving the listener along through its shifts in mood that you aren't taken by surprise by \"Through Her Eyes,\" one of two touching ballads on the album. The Middle Eastern melody-flecked \"Home\" is the heaviest \"scene,\" and it doesn't seem to last the 13 minutes it actually takes.\n\n\"Home,\" it turns out, is a pet name for Victoria, who left her boyfriend, Julian (\"The Miracle\"), because he could not control his drinking and gambling. She finds solace in the arms of his brother, Edward (\"The Sleeper\"), who falls in love with her. But here's what Nick finds out while visiting Edward's house: he had manipulated the crime scene to make it look like a murder-suicide...because Edward was the one who shot both Victoria and Julian.\n\nYou see, what Nick is able to discover is that Julian begged Victoria to take him back, as a changed man--and she accepts. Edward, driven insane by desire, plots the murder and leaves a suicide note in Julian's pocket to fool the police. Seventy years later, the murder is solved by the \"endless thread, impossible to break\" that links Victoria to the future in a way that none of them could understand at the time.\n\nAt this point, it is the epic gospel ballad \"The Spirit Carries On\" that carries the album to its dramatic high point. Here, LaBrie is joined by a gospel choir to deliver a message worthy of a eulogy (seriously, you could play this song at a funeral and no one would be sad anymore). John Petrucci's solo proves that it is not just his technical proficiency but his heart and sense for soulful melody that makes him one of the world's most admired guitarists. At that point, you feel as if you've just watched a magnificent movie and standing to applaud in the theater while the credits roll. And the wrap-up of \"Finally Free\" finds drummer Mike Portnoy entering what can only be described as \"beast mode\" on the outro. One of the Long Island native's finest moments as a drummer.\n\nUpon release, Metropolis, Part 2 was performed live in its entirely all over the world on tour, a tradition I hope the band revives. \"It was very satisfying on so many levels,\" remarks John Petrucci, \"....I was worried whether it was going to be good enough, or if it was going to come out like some Spinal Tap rock opera! So it becoming successful was like we had proven something.\"\n\nThe murder is solved, and yet the cycle begins again, as Nick's psychotherapist ushers in his next incarnation by killing him in his home while he listens to music. Who will Nick become next? What new mysteries are there to be solved \"Beyond This Life?\"\n\nSomething to ponder, as anytime you listen to this record, you know that you are not just hearing, but watching and living.\n\nJames LaBrie\nJohn Petrucci\nJohn Myung\nMike Portnoy\nJordan Rudess\n\nOriginally written for www.headofmetal.com\n",
        "\nDepending on who you ask, Dream Theater is either pretentious or genius. They\u2019ve done concept albums, meta-album cycles, the Twelve-Step Suite, and they\u2019ve even written a forty-two minute song that takes up an entire CD. With Octavarium, they take it to another level. Basically, the whole album is a nugget. It\u2019s been analyzed by the fans and there is a webpage floating somewhere out there dedicated to better understanding all the references it contains. In short, it\u2019s an album based off the concept of, yes, you guessed it, the octave, with a recurring theme of fives and eights. Each song is in a different key, riffs are repeated subtly throughout it, and it continues the meta-album cycle, starting where Train of Thought ended and finishing on the same note that that begins the album's first track, Root of All Evil (coming \u201cFull Circle\u201d).\n\nThe album flaunts its influences shamelessly; I Walk Beside You an uninspired attempt at a radio-friendly, poppy sound with some guidance from bands like Foreigner and U2, and Never Enough, while a good song, basically rips off Muse\u2019s Stockholm Syndrome. Panic Attack also exhibits the same influence, to a lesser extent, sounding more original, but it is seems like a clear reference to another Muse song, Hysteria. It falls on the heavier end of the Dream Theater spectrum, and the lyrics fit the music extremely well: it's frantic, nervous, and fast-paced. The Answer Lies Within is a return to balladry and it\u2019s the worst song on the album, a cheesy soft rock number that deserves to be eternally skipped, unless you like their soft stuff. Generally, the album\u2019s first six songs tend to be more structurally traditional (and shorter), many of them using one main riff repeated throughout to tie the song together, and Sacrificed Sons is a fairly standard ten-minute DT epic that starts off slow and builds up through an instrumental section.\n\nDream Theater definitely saved the best for last. As for influences, the twenty-four minute epic title track displays so many that part three of its lyrics are devoted to naming all of them. Octavarium is a tribute to progressive music as a whole, but it does not really move the genre anywhere new (except perhaps in terms of musicianship), instead opting to summarize the best of all that has been done already. The structure of this song is incredibly effective and it must be taken as a whole (and listened to multiple times) in order to get the most out of it. Octavarium builds up steadily for almost twenty minutes, reaching an intense, climactic bout of LaBrie screaming over an odd time signature pattern. It doesn\u2019t sound very exciting when I say it like that, but when you finally get there after tension gradually increases until you\u2019re wondering how it could possibly get any more extreme, it\u2019s incredibly satisfying. The keyboard solo at about halfway through and the instrumental insanity that ensues between part three and the song\u2019s climax really moves the song forward in intensity, rather than just being Dream Theater showing off for the hell of it, like most of their solos/instrumental parts. The intro is fantastically spacey and there\u2019s even a flute solo, and as if that\u2019s not enough, John Myung is actually audible during part two. The title track is a prog masterpiece and probably Dream Theater\u2019s best song, and defining moment. If moments lasted for twenty-four minutes.\n\nThe band\u2019s albums after this have seemed relatively unambitious, up until The Astonishing (or less pretentious, if you see it that way). That might be because they\u2019ve already tried everything. Octavarium is an excellent effort, the title track making up for a few weaker songs. Dream Theater have taken their dozens of influences and crafted something that some may see as pompous, but I view as uniquely elaborate and bold. Definitely worth checking out and not an album to be dismissed.\n",
        "\nDream Theater - a band who blazed the trails for numerous bands of progressive metal genre strikes back with its new record. With the double-cd and two hour-long rock-opera, Dream Theater introduces us to its vision of a world in which music is created by machines.\n\nFirst things first, The Astonishing is a concept album, with a certain story line and characters. With the official booklet provided with the CDs, the listener may enter this world and understand the story better. \"The Astonishing\" tells a story of futuristic world in which a human has no right or possibility to create his own music. It is a story of a war between The Great Northern Empire of the Americas and The Ravenskill Rebellion where \"Music is playing the central role\" (according to John Petrucci). \n\nMy first impression is that Dream Theater presented something very different from their previous recordings. It is because the whole album was recorded with an orchestra conducted by David Campbell. Of course, we heard it on the previous album but not in such extent. The amount of orchestral elements is impressive while there we can hear classic and also boys or gospel choirs, which gives an additional climax to this music. \n\nAs far as composition is concerned, John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess are the main heroes of this story. It is clearly audible that guitars and keyboards have the central role in here connected with Myung and Mangini supporting it in a rhythmical section. What one may find as a disadvantage of the album - you cannot expect any solo performances of John Myung or Mike Mangini, they seem to remain in a shadow of the rest. The songs themselves were composed with many interesting new ideas, which we did not hear before in DT. I mentioned gospel choirs but we can hear many memory remaining melodies and passages. Above the whole album concept, we may see that some musical themes tend to repeat which is understandable. One may perceive the whole album as a kind of official movie soundtrack due to its element of an epic. \n\nI will give a separate paragraph for a vocal section, which concerns the performance of James LaBrie. He was a subject to discussions whether he is a good vocalist or not, but I think that in the album he have proved that he still is a strong player in the game. Having to face a quite hard task to be the voices of eight different characters required him to arrange different vocal techniques. Just listen to him in \"Lord Nafaryus\" or his maniacal laughter in \"Three Days\". The way in which he managed to perform the vocals is quite impressive. \n\nIf I had to say which songs on the album are my favorites, the answer is that I cannot just say which song is better than others are. Such judgments would be harmful statements to the album. We need to treat it as a whole. Nevertheless, if I was forced to say so I only have the impression that the first Act of the album is slightly better (with the stress on SLIGHTLY). Act 2 has also numerous and memorable moments which has driven me to tears (just listen to \"Begin Again\" and you will know what I mean). It is finished with a monumental \"Astonishing\" which somehow summarizes the album.\n\nNevertheless, If I was to recommend some songs to some DT newbies, I would suggest to check out \"Dystopian Overture\" ; \"Moment of Betrayal\" ; \"My Last Farewell\" ; \"Our New World\" ; \"Astonishing\" ; \"Lord Nafaryus\" ; \"Three Days\" or \"A New Beginning\". Still, you will not get the impression that you can get while listening to a whole album.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that DT did a great job and the album is certainly worth your money. It is nicely composed and performed. I am also impressed by the artwork, which you can see in the official release (provided with an original textbook, world map and portraits of the characters). I have only one word to say about the album: I am Astonished.\n",
        "\nDream Theater\u2019s most ambitious and conceptual albums have tended to be my favorites from them \u2013 Metropolis Part 2, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, and Octavarium. It\u2019s been a while since they have attempted a project of such a caliber as The Astonishing; their last two if not four albums essentially have seen the band going on autopilot, producing some of their most uninspired, standard, paint-by-the-numbers \u201cprogressive,\u201d material. The Astonishing dethrones all of the newer-era and even the bold mid-era works in terms of its elaborate concept and massive 130 minute runtime, but unfortunately it does not nearly dethrone them in terms of quality. The songwriting unoriginal and unintriguing, and the concept poorly executed and clich\u00e9, while not entirely bad, it nevertheless falls woefully short.\n\nMusically speaking, this is far different than most Dream Theater releases, something made obvious by the sheer amount of songs and their short runtimes, each individually averaging below four minutes. (!?) The instrumental wankery that has until now been a staple of Dream Theater has been massively cut down upon, which could definitely be interpreted as a good thing (it would seem that they finally figured out that they have nothing left to prove). At least if interesting songwriting has been compromised for storytelling, we don\u2019t have to hear Petrucci or Rudess play a thousand notes in one second, as they are wont to do on most DT recordings. Myung is again inaudible and the drums aren\u2019t particularly interesting, blending into the background and not doing any more than they need to.\n\nThere are very few moments from The Astonishing that could be called metal; most of it is cheesy balladry with a few prog rock songs thrown into the mix, plenty tending to lie somewhere in between two categories. The prog rock songs aren\u2019t bad but don\u2019t really do anything new for DT, though the more typical rock/metal-leaning songs still end up sticking out more. A New Beginning is the most reminiscent of a typical Dream Theater epic, and the quiet part at five minutes in is truly the only little musical fluctuation that pops out during the entire album. Brother Can You Hear Me is not typical DT, instead an immense, grand anthem or a chant, and it sounds like something that warriors in the middle ages would sing to prepare themselves for battle. Its reprise in the final/title track gave me the chills the first time through and it was a powerful conclusion to the album even though I found the characters and plot to be lacking.\n\nThe NOMAC (noise machine) tracks, each short interlude placed throughout the album, really aren\u2019t necessary, would perhaps be nice if they were used to break up longer songs, if those existed on The Astonishing. Fortunately these seem to take the place of unnecessary samples, of which there are few. Dream Theater also took the liberty of adding in the symphonic and choral elements that have been on their albums as of late. There are yet more additions: a horn section, and bagpipes. Yes, bagpipes. On the X Aspect. On a more positive note, I like the horns a lot; normally they hang in the background, but on Three Days they take the forefront briefly and gloriously unexpectedly.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t been acquainted with the background information of The Astonishing, such as its characters and the premise behind it, before listening I would recommend you do so. This is an album that demands the listener\u2019s full attention, and it is easy to miss something in the plot or not realize which character is singing if one happens to lose concentration for even a short time. LaBrie supposedly tries to sing in a different voice for each character, a feature that I am not really catching on to. It might be easier to understand who is narrating if he had taken an Ayreon-style approach and brought in a different singer for each character. People also say that his voice has improved since last album, but I don\u2019t hear this either \u2013 he sounds the same as ever, below average but still listenable.\n\nThe plot itself is generic. No two ways about it. Borrowing heavily from Rush\u2019s 2112 about the freedom of music, the rest of its concept is your typical young adult dystopian sci-fi, with perhaps a hint of fantasy. The idea of a future oppressive government has been used time and time again throughout sci-fi\u2019s history, from Orwell\u2019s classic 1984 to the The Hunger Games. On top of that we have \u201cthe chosen one\u201d and straight people who enjoy the clich\u00e9 of (forbidden) love at first sight. If you\u2019re not sold on how bad this is, read the plot description from When Your Time Has Come from the official Dream Theater website:\n\n\u201cLike a lightning bolt from the heavens and without hesitation, they immediately know that they are meant to be together and that this encounter was no accident.\u201d\n\nIf this isn\u2019t the cheesiest thing you\u2019ve ever read then I don\u2019t know what to tell you, but thankfully these aren\u2019t actual lyrics. Like many concept albums, The Astonishing runs the risk of being incredibly tacky, which it does indeed, and this is merely one of its offenses. The worst part of the plot besides the love story has to be how the conflict is resolved. I\u2019m not going to ruin it for you but it involves the power of music so just use your imagination for this one.\n\nThe Astonishing isn\u2019t doing anything new from a compositional standpoint, and the actual narrative and concept are weak and unoriginal as well. But because it\u2019s so different from anything else that Dream Theater has done, it is difficult to assign it a numerical value. The band has tried really hard to make themselves inaccessible, not in terms of sound, but with sheer album length and their intense focus on a storyline. Ultimately it comes down to one\u2019s personal feelings about many short songs, concept albums, and a whole lot of ballads. The Astonishing has some solid tracks on it, but in general the writing is boring and does not do anything interesting, though the lyrics at least keep things mildly entertaining. If no one\u2019s got the time for music anymore, then they sure don\u2019t have time for this two-hour overblown concept album.\n",
        "\nI feel sorry for Dream Theater. In my opinion this album could be a huge comeback for them after a series of unfocused and uninspired albums. I highly doubt if they could create a concept album as monumental as 'Scenes From A Memory', but this album could be a solid concept album from start to end if some changes were made.\n\nSo what this album is all about? 'The Astonishing' follows a storyline describing futuristic dystopia located in the United States, where apparently no form of entertainment is allowed. Without spoiling too much of the plot, the story mainly revolves around a hero named 'Gabriel' which possesses a unique ability to sing and create music in a region ruled by an oppressive emperor named 'Nafaryus' who sees 'Gabriel' as threat for his regime. There are approximately eight different characters in this story, and while it could be interesting to follow such a story, something was very problematic with the implementation of this concept.\n\nFirst of all, eight characters are way too much for a sole vocalist to handle. If you don't read the lyrics strictly while listening to the song, it can be a confusing task to distinguish between the different characters, mainly because most of the lyrics are written in a form of first person and also because 'Labrie' just can't change his timbre enough to sound like a separate character. If there were more vocalists in this album, females and males, each for their character, this album could sound much more authentic and you could really feel the emotions and personalities of each character. Don't get me wrong, 'Labrie' did an amazing job in this album, his voice sounds crystal clear and powerful at times, shifting between registers at ease, but it still doesn't enough to carry eight different personalities for 130 minutes.\n\nSecondly, this album is way too long and there are too many tracks which has no interesting musical ideas at all and just fill the void for the continuity of the plot. There are moments in this album where I really got the feeling that the music serves as a background for the story, and not vice versa as would expected from a music album! Honestly, I am sure that 'Dream Theater' went way too far in this aspect, there's just no excuse to drag such an album for that period of time. The storyline is quite simple and could be delivered in half of the exaggerated length of this album and nothing justifies recording such a long album, except for the sake of doing it!\n\nSo you probably ask, what is still good about this album? Actually, quite a bit. While not as inspiring as before, 'Petrucci' composed some really sophisticated and mesmerizing guitar solos and there are some catchy guitar riffs here and there. 'Labrie', while has his limits with varying his vocal timbre enough, still carries out some beautiful melodies. There are probably more ballads in this album than aggressive tracks, which sometimes makes the songs sounds quite alike, and after multiple listenings you'll probably chose to skip some of the songs. \n\nI must add that there were some surprising moments in this album. For example the track 'Three Days'. It has a really dynamic structure and ends with something that sounds like a Broadway's segment combined with short black metal blast beats, quite surprising to say the least. 'Dystopian Overture' is also a nice instrumental piece with some catchy sections and a lot of variation. Overall, throughout the album there are some themes that repeat themselves and gives this album a decent sense of continuity and that it is a concept album.\n\nTo sum up, 'The Astonishing' had the potential to be a much better album than how it came out eventually. If it was shorter in probably fifty percent, it could be a much more focused album with less fillers and was overall a more enjoyable experience. Also, multiple vocalists could enhance the expirence and really make the different characters in the story more 'alive', so to speak. If you never found anything interesting in their classic albums ('Scenes From A Memory', 'Images & Words, 'Awake', etc.), this album probably won't change anything for you. However, if you have some appreciation for this band, definitely check this one out. But, consider that this album requires quite a bit of attention and time, which make it tiresome at points and can't be listened offhandedly.\n\nI mainly feel disappointed after hearing this album, simply because I know it could really be astonishing if it was a little less ambitious.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll be frank here; I honestly had very little hopes for this album. Their last self-titled album was the biggest meh in a series of predictable and boring releases for over a decade now. Okay maybe in some ways, Black Clouds And Silver Linings can be considered an exception as it did away with some of the flab that made their past releases so sleep-inducing by bringing a bit of their Images & Words/Awake songwriting to the forefront, but still. The fact that it was going to be 2 discs worth of material was enough to get alarm bells ringing. Seriously this is a message to all prog bands out there; unless you have astute and amazing songwriting skills, double albums are very rarely a good idea. I mean c\u2019mon since the turn of the century DT has been known for stretching their songs out way past their time using it as an excuse for being superficially progressive, and this is just pushing it to the extreme. \n\nAt the very least, I was quite pleasantly surprised to see that no song exceeded the 10 minute mark with the longest song being seven and a half minutes! Wow okay then, maybe there\u2019s some hope after all, I thought. These guys finally kept the \u201cNeed at least three songs longer than 10 minutes in our albums\u201d fetish (A Dramatic Turn Of Events was the worst offender in this department) in their pants this time. Well they did the same with their last album but cocked it up with shitty songwriting and finishing the album with a freaking 22 minute long borefest of the highest order. I have yet to meet a single fan or person face-to-face who actually thinks \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d was a good song on that album. Seriously guys like let that shit go already, you\u2019re just not good at it anymore. Kindly accept that fact and move on. \n\nBut one the other hand, seeing so many interlude tracks and instrumentals barely exceeding the two minute mark, my guard immediately went up. Would this be the same problem that plagued records like \u201cTestimony Of The Ancients\u201d and \u201cNightfall In Middle Earth\u201d having awesome songs being ruined by heaps of instrumental and narrative filler adding nothing to the music whatsoever and only serving to prolong the length of the album? Either which way, the prospects didn\u2019t look too good. But anyways, back to the album.\n\nI heard both the singles (\u201cMoment Of Betrayal\u201d and \u201cThe Gift Of Music\u201d) that had been released a month before the album release, and I was (initially) quite underwhelmed. Neither song really did anything for me in the least except for a few sections here and there. Although \u201cThe Gift Of Music\u201d (if I could just change the title and lyrics) did grow a bit on me after a few listens and the chorus of \u201cMoment Of Betrayal\u201d is actually catchy plus both songs actually did put a considerable emphasis on song structure rather than the instrumental sections. Now that I come to think of it, after listening to the entire album, those two singles are probably the better songs off the album.\n\nOh and the lyrics are just vomit inducing. I mean okay, they never head great lyrics, but here coupled with Labrie\u2019s annoying whining is just grating in every sense of the word and had me cringing every time. Pass me the barf bag already. Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence too suffered from the same problem. I mean just take a look at this stanza from \u201cThe Gift Of Music\u201d. Like the song title itself wasn\u2019t cheesy enough. \n\nPeople just don't have the time for music any more.\nAnd no one seems to care\nMy friends have seen the chosen one \nA quest for freedom has begun\n\nOh and believe me, it gets worse:\n\nThere walks a god among us \nWho's seen the writing on the wall. \nHe is the revolution \nHe'll be the one to save us all.\n\nYeah no shit sonny boy. How about you become a freaking messiah and take up teaching the masses now? Wake up people and prepare yourselves for the new world order blah blah blah. Blearrgh! I mean sweet Jesus (irony!!), are you guys even for real? I\u2019m sure even 12 year olds could come up with better lyrics than that in their sleep now. Yeah I think that pretty much sums it up. The keyboard work in the song is nice though, along with the guitar in certain parts. Yeah I know I sound like an elitist prick, trashing lyrics that don\u2019t even matter in the grand scheme of things, but seriously you simply cannot call yourselves one of the longest running bands in prog and still write lyrics of this calibre. Keep in mind that the very fact that I used that word in the case of this sorry excuse for lyrics denotes that I\u2019m actually being generous for a change. Suck on that one fanboys. \n\nSo on the whole, how does this album fare? Well sleep-inducingly okay, if I had to summarize it. I seriously wish I could just leave it at that and go on with my life, but then again, a review is a review. For starters, yes it is an improvement over the last two albums in case you were wondering. Yeah they caught the annoying \u201cLet\u2019s put random interludes in between the songs to stretch it out to a double album\u201d bug, but at least the songwriting is stronger this time around, which does provide some relief that there may be actual hope for their next album after all. \n\nSome of the songs like \u201cThe Gift Of Music\u201d (ignore the lyrics though), \u201cA Better Life\u201d (the most metal song on the album) \u201cA Savoir In The Square\u201d, \u201cMoment Of Betrayal\u201d, \u201cThe Path That Divides\u201d and \"Our New World\" do break out of the traditional DT shell, surprisingly offering quite a few ear perking moments and interesting ideas not to mention the band actually sounds cohesive and tight, but I was gazing at the clock most of the time, surprised that not even an hour had passed by. Yawn. I mean my pillow was already beckoning me even before the first disc was over, so make of that what you will. Some of the interludes and other songs with rampant piano playing sounded more like elevator music with vocals rather than anything associated with progressive metal. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that at all, but then again that\u2019s all that it is - inoffensively bland. Most of the songs sound way too samey and homogeneous to actually be able to pick out standouts tracks from all the mush. Okay maybe that was a tad harsh, but you get the drift. John Petrucci is in his same old solo whipping frenzy mode as ever before, and thankfully there aren\u2019t too many times where he goes overboard. Great solo in \u201cA New Beginning\u201d by the way. Too bad the song is boring. Disc 2 kicks up the symphonic factor and crazy piano runs, but again fails to make much of an impression. The intro of \u201cHymn Of A Thousand Voices\u201d sounds more like something I would hear in a country song. The violin so does not work guys, so please knock that shit off already. \n\nAll in all, Dream Theater do improve on some of their flaws (actual songs, no excessive wankery, having an actual flow to the album etc) but cock it up yet again by having just too much music on display. A good piece of advice to the band for all future endeavors: Too much music is still too music at the end of the day guys, no matter how hard you might try. There\u2019s very little variance or ideas to keep you interested in the album all through, no matter how much of a patient listener you may claim to be. The title \u201cThe Astonishing\u201d is a complete fucking misnomer just in case you were wondering; there is nothing even remotely astonishing about this album, except for the fact that they actually though having a 2 hour long album was a good idea. Now come to think of it, \u201cThe Astonishing Thought\u201d would\u2019ve been a much more appropriate title for the album methinks. Goddamn how many times have I said that word already now? \n\nIf symphonic prog of the highest order stretched out to a meandering two hours plus is your perfect cup of tea, you\u2019ll probably cream your pants over this. However prog or not, if you like actually remembering the music you listen to, I would advise you to distance yourself from this album and go back to spinning Black Clouds & Silver Linings for the nth time if you haven\u2019t already. For the curious, just listen to the songs I listed. I know I did, so maybe that\u2019s saying something. \n\nAnyways if you a fan of the band, go right ahead and listen to the album. Hell in all probability, you\u2019ll probably enjoy it a lot more than I did. It is better than the last two after all. Then again, I fucking loathed their most technical and acclaimed (read overrated and overlong) album Scenes From A Memory (more like Scenes From A Wankery), accusing it of having all of the worst excesses of prog music, so what do I know?\n",
        "\nUntil 2016\u2019s The Astonishing, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was Dream Theater\u2019s only double album and undeniably their most ambitious and complex work. If intricacy is addressed from a compositional standpoint, this definitely beats out The Astonishing; judging by song lengths alone one can tell that 6DoIT will be, quite simply, insane. No, that word choice of \u201cinsane\u201d was not intended to mock those with mental disorders, a concept that disc two deals heavily with. Except maybe I\u2019ll make fun of narcissism, from which we all know Dream Theater probably suffers.\n\nFor the purposes of my Longest Songs in Metal series, this review will be split into two main sections that concentrate on each disc separately.\n\nDisc one: 90%.\n\nSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u2019s first five songs are not very different in overall sound from what one would expect going into a Dream Theater album, but they seem somehow more compact, likely due to the first disc\u2019s relatively short runtime of fifty-four minutes. The Glass Prison, upon opening the album, also begins Mike Portnoy\u2019s Twelve-Step Suite and is perhaps its strongest installment. With an early guitar solo that screams of Symphony X, it also lies on the heavier end of the Dream Theater spectrum and most certainly affirms their metal edge. Portnoy\u2019s semi-harsh vocals plus the chanting can be quite a bit cheesy, but the chorus provides a sense of relief from the rest of the song, and this track is right where it needs to be.\n\nWhile the length is not an issue for The Glass Prison, a few of these other songs could do with some trimming, even if we\u2019re considering DT\u2019s love of instrumental masturbation as part of the package. The Great Debate is fairly forgettable aside from its lyrical topic and forceful chorus, lacking good riffs or an interesting mood, or much else that may give a song appeal. The samples don\u2019t really need to be present in such abundance, though they build context for the lyrics. The somber Misunderstood simply takes too much time to wind down after arriving at its climactic chorus.\n\nThe other two songs do not suffer from any obvious problems but do not quite reach the heights of the Glass Prison. Blind Faith\u2019s intro has an interesting spacious feeling that reminds me of the jungle for whatever reason, and the churchy choir and organ part in the middle fit in well with the lyrical themes. Once one gets to the first disc\u2019s final song, Disappear, said individual will be \u201criding the feels train\u201d so to speak, and that\u2019s the best way I can put it. This could be construed as just another one of Dream Theater\u2019s often cheesy ballads that tries too hard to play with the emotions, but you have to let it hit you. Heartbroken, lost, and despairing, LaBrie attempts to punch the soul of the listener with what is easily the band\u2019s best soft song.\n\nDisc one has a few notable flaws and shortcomings but it more than makes up for these with some very strong songs (or parts of songs). Lots of emotion on this one, may it be anger, fear, sadness, or contemplation, and although the songs deal with very different topics, they fit together well, which is what DT intended.\n\nDisc two: 80%.\n\nThe first time I ever listened to this track, I thought that it was very short for a Dream Theater album. Turns out that it was only one song, forty-two minutes long and split into eight sections that contain a few repeating themes, all previewed in the overture. Often times the structure of a song of this length can make or break it, and 6DoIT is no exception. I like the approach of having distinct movements, a surefire way to circumvent the issue of having a song become too monotonous, but it has its drawbacks if not done extremely well \u2013 it can lack flow, feel disconnected, and meander too much without functioning as a whole. These problems affect this song to an extent but not so much that it becomes unlistenable or even bad.\n\nMusically speaking, this showcases the full spectrum of DT\u2019s heaviness, from the often unpleasant balladry of Goodnight Kiss and Solitary Shell, to the more metal Test That Stumped Them All, and everything in between. None of it steps far outside their established sound, but each individual segment is not given room to develop, each a fairly average or sub-par Dream Theater song when taken from the context of the overarching forty-two minute track. One section does not flow naturally into the next and although it works it can sound forced at times. There is one point between parts four and five when the song completely dies down and might as well have been split in two.\n\nThe lyrics on 6DoIT, like the movements, are a good concept but don\u2019t quite reach their full potential. The \u201csix degrees\u201d are the six people described in each of the sections (with Overture not covering any specific individual and one of the degrees receiving a reprise), and the lyrics describe their struggles with a specific mental disorder. This could have been very interesting but unfortunately the lyrics just aren\u2019t well written. In Goodnight Kiss, you have LaBrie confessing that he is just a poor girl so lonely without baby\u2019s love, and in About to Crash singing about \u201cthe perfect teenage girl.\u201d Mental disorders can be pretty metal but they passed up an opportunity here.\n\n6DoIT is a good song with a lot of good concepts behind it, but unfortunately the music itself isn\u2019t always DT\u2019s best material, and the poorly written lyrics can detract from the experience. The structure makes it more accessible, and the flow isn\u2019t bad but it could be better. Even though this is receiving a relatively high score, it\u2019s not something I would recommend unless you\u2019re beyond the level of casual fan.\n\nMoving back to the big picture including both discs, though flawed, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is one of Dream Theater\u2019s most ambitious, conceptually unique, and overall one of their finest works, especially a few of those songs from disc one \u2013 The Glass Prison is some killer prog metal and Disappear is simply heartbreaking. This is definitely a beast of an album and probably not a good point of entry to the Dream Theater universe, but if you\u2019re an older fan and you haven\u2019t heard this album in a while, I encourage you to revisit it. \n\nAverage of two disc scores/overall rating: 85%.\n",
        "\nI had the fortune of buying this album fairly cheaply after seeing Dream Theater live back in February 2014, and I'd already heard \"The Glass Prison\" (I'd heard all of the 12-step suite by then), so I was pretty hyped, and I was not disappointed in the slightest.\n\nFirstly, the band has come off on a relative high after the incredibly warm reception of Scenes From A Memory, and this album delivers six quality offerings, tackling all sorts of issues in quite a clever way - managing to stay pretty non-partisan throughout, which means that not only are they songs to be listened to, the issues can be talked about, and in the case of \"Disappear\", related to. We all fear death to some degree, whether it be our death or the death of people around us, so to capture that feeling in a surprisingly serene song is just astounding. Musically, the songs tend to be fairly similar, all involving controlled outbursts around the chorus mark (for those songs with choruses) and fairly frantic instrumentation. A particular highlight of this is the growing keyboard ostinato at the beginning of \"The Great Debate\" that sounds like a newsflash - clever, given that the next thing that happens is that the listener hears samples of news bulletins about the embryonic stem cell research debacle. The way in which the instruments are used is also of particular note as well, with epic basslines galore, soaring vocals (one of LaBrie's finest performances to date) and quite possibly the weirdest guitar solo in \"Misunderstood\" that I have ever heard. John Petrucci initially recorded that solo going forwards, then learned to play it backwards, recorded the backwards version, THEN PLAYED THAT ONE BACKWARDS. The result is ... colourful, to say the least\n\nBut, of course, I am stalling somewhat. Disc 1 is good, but the true highlight of the album is the title track, which occupies all of Disc 2, and tackles one of the most talked-about, yet taboo at the same time, issues in our society - mental disorders. Each part highlights (with a fair amount of poetic license) how 6 different people, with six different disorders, cope (or, in some cases, struggle to get through) with day-to-day life, with disorders ranging from Asperger's Syndrome (\"Solitary Shell\", one of my absolute favourites in the cycle) on a spectrum of how disabling they are, which climaxes in Part 4 - \"The Test That Stumped Them All\", with a sonic fireworks display representing schizophrenia. Part 4 is one of the most sonically violent pieces Dream Theater have ever composed, all wrapped up within a 13/8 time signature (which seems oddly appropriate given the \"sonic rage\" felt by sufferers of schizophrenia). Dynamically, the whole song builds up to \"The Test That Stumped Them All\", then falls abruptly away into \"Goodnight Kiss\", then builds back up again to the finale, which gives the overall impression of a turbulent auditory journey, which ends with a message to respect those who live with these types of disorders.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the album is that, on Disc 1, some of the sections within songs just seem there for the sake of being there (something which their later album, A Dramatic Turn Of Events, also suffers from), and this makes some songs, such as \"Blind Faith\" seem over-stretched, and detracts slightly from the experience, but not by a huge amount.\n\nIn conclusion: despite some filler sections in songs on Disc 1, this album gets a HUGE thumbs up from me! If you don't own it already, go and listen to it (or at least the title track) and prepare to be amazed and moved as I was.\n",
        "\nThis album was my first proper introduction to Dream Theater, so I've got a lot to owe it - it helped me get into one of the most celebrated prog metal bands of all time. And this is probably their best representation in album form, albeit more a dedication to the longtime fans than something to draw a new crowd in (like their self-titled), I still enjoyed it greatly. It took a while to get into, but I love it. You can keep Machine Head, THIS was my 21st Century Master Of Puppets (so much so that I still think the intro to \"The Shattered Fortress\" sounds a bit like the intro to \"Disposable Heroes\")! \n\nAs far as Dream Theater albums go, this is definitely one of the heavier albums - made apparent by track names such as \"A Nightmare To Remember\" and \"The Shattered Fortress\" and it delivers on that heaviness. The sound manages to be dense without coming across as stodgy, mainly thanks to Petrucci's driving, crunchy and memorable riffage which NEVER AT ANY POINT seem at all boring or repetitive to me, even after repeat listens. This is partly due to, if a riff appears twice in a song, it will be varied somehow. For example, one riff in \"A Nightmare To Remember\" appears once in 4/4, and again in 12/8 where the meter's a bit messed up. Portnoy's drumming, once again, fits perfectly with the rest of the music, which seems almost as if it's scored in tandem with the instrumentals, as opposed to merely added. A good example is the escalating intensity of round-the-kit rolls in the full band intro in \"The Count Of Tuscany\". I also find that, on this album certainly, there's an element of groove in the overall style and execution of each song. It's hard to describe with any word that isn't 'infectious'.\n\nOne of the most interesting specimens I found was \"The Shattered Fortress\" which, after some digging and noticing similarities between this and \"This Dying Soul\" off of Train Of Thought, I found out about the 12-step suite, and that \"The Shattered Fortress\" was in fact the climax of said suite. It certainly feels like a climax, especially with the fade-in of pounding drums and guitars and epic synth-strings.\n\nAlso, despite this being quite a heavy album, each song, save for \"A Rite Of Passage\", has a very nicely worked-in softer section to counter-balance the heaviness on offer, which gave me some of the greatest pleasure on the entire album. A prime example of this is Jordan Rudess's lap-steel solo in the middle of \"The Count Of Tuscany\", which for me was a seemingly-endless mental ocean of elation and tranquility, before the coda to by far my favourite track on the album. \n\nThe covers on Disc 2 are also excellent. Dream Theater manage to take the song, make it seem familiar to fans of the original and STILL put their own epic spin on it. Before I actually checked, I was convinced that they were originals too, and they're quite a wide mix of impressive covers as well, with names such as Queen, Iron Maiden, and some one-hit wonder glam band from the 80s called Zebra. I would go so far as to say that what Dream Theater adds to these songs makes them superior to the originals. Take Iron Maiden's \"To Tame A Land\", for instance. I think the added touch of synthesized sitar helps bring a more Arabian feel which evokes wandering a war-torn desert, perfectly fitting the subject matter (the song is based around Frank Herbert's \"Dune\"). If anything, the entire package is Jordan's album. His keywork is present and mind-blowing on pretty much all the songs, and it manages to impress me every time I listen to it, and envy the fact that, despite being something of a pianist, I could never dream of pulling off what he does.\n\nDisc 3 is a bit of a throwaway, containing the six originals in instrumental form, i.e. minus the vocals, fade-ins/outs and solos, BOO. Ok, so maybe it's not THAT much of a throwaway, but unless you're planning a Dream Theater karaoke night with some of your friends, I can't think of much else to do with it. Still interesting, but it would have been nice to keep the solos, because that's a key aspect of Dream Theater's sound and nature.\n\nIn all, this album is primarily fan service, but it can (and did) draw in a new audience, and it's a wholly spectacular offering. Even with the pointless instrumentals on Disc 3, I would recommend you get the special edition as the covers are very good, managing to stay true to the originals while adding a little extra flavour. And even if you get the normal version which only contains Disc 1, you're still in for a voyage of metal ecstasy!\n",
        "\nI've been a fan of Dream Theater's work for about 5 years now, starting with Black Clouds and Silver Linings, so that album has a special place in my heart. When I first heard A Dramatic Turn Of Events I was a tad disappointed, but subsequent listenings, like a lot of DT's stuff, made the album more enjoyable.\n\nOddly enough, this is not the case with their latest album. The experience could be compared to watching the movie \"Gravity\". Interesting teaser, mind-blowing when first experienced, but subsequent experiences fail to capture the magic of the first time around.\n\nOne thing I definitely wasn't prepared for was the on-the-whole different sound found on the rest of the album to the promotional single, The Enemy Inside. It's much lighter, and shows a great dynamic range, so there is a connection felt. However, the album appears to rest on it's laurels in terms of holding up the 'prog' label. There is a very strong Rush influence on this particular album, though, so that may be the reason why. Also, Petrucci is struggling to think up good lyrics to write. Case in point: The Bigger Picture, Behind The Veil and Along For The Ride, with such rough patches on an adequate diamond as \"I can't stop the world from turning around, nor the pull of the moon on the tide\", \"Someone save me, look behind the veil\" and \"Shed your light on me...to reveal the bigger picture\". \n\nThe one track I REALLY like off of the album, though, is the latest edition to their epic library, Illumination Theory. It does something a bit different. In lieu of being cyclical like many of DT's epics (12-step, Count Of Tuscany, Octavarium, Nightmare To Remember) it has a definite beginning and end, and several sections in between. The piano jam is also a really neat way to end the album, like hearing post-credits music. The False Awakening Suite is also another favourite of mine, as it really gets you riled to listen to what Dream Theater has to offer this time around.\n\nOn the whole, the album feels like a sandwich that has two nice bits of meat on top and on the bottom, and a thick slice of bread in the middle. Great start, great end, the rest is OK. But I would recommend using this album to get your friends into Dream Theater if they're curious (along with When Dream and Day Unite and Images and Words)\n",
        "\nIf you read the title before clicking then I must stress that the last part of this release is good. This release is basically 2 different radio cuts and the original so this should be pretty.\n\nAs I Am as it is presented on the album is a solid song. The riffs are cool and this song lays off the proggy influences a bit giving it a more power/heavy metal feel to it, even a bit hard rock sounding. Another wonderful example that Dream Theater are adept at writing a variety of songs. The guitar pulls some cool riffs, the drums and bass keep up the pace as it fits. The vocals sound a bit like the style from Rush (not unusual for Dream Theater). The song has a very calm and controlled sound instead of the thrashing, powerhouse and aggressive songs we usually here coined as metal.\n\nUnfortunately this song (like many songs) is written to fit with itself like a puzzle with pieces transitioning to other pieces and written to try to keep the listener entertained through the entire thing. So when you cut bits out for a radio edit that's around 3 minutes shorter you end up cutting it to something that seems more like a jumble of parts. The verses and choruses are left almost untouched, as expected when cutting a song to fit the corporate masses. Its the transitions, the intro and the instrumental sections that suffer. \n\n85% for the original version and let's just ignore the two cuts when we total the overall score.\n",
        "\nDream Theater\u2019s tenth full length studio album is a continuation of all the elements that the pioneers of progressive metal have over the years defined: Lengthy songs with a complex structure, highly technical complex timed instrumental sections, personal-themed lyrical subjects and a fair mix of catchiness and complexity. Dream Theater, on this record, do not venture out in wild territories with experimentation but rather perfect and refine all the elements that they have helped define to work together in a cohesion such was never seen since the days of Awake. \n\nNothing should be said about technical performance on a Dream Theater record since all of the gentlemen involved are absolute masters of their crafts and so I\u2019ll use my praise here quite frugally only in saying that the technical performances are nothing short of brilliant and are consistent with the standards that the band has now set up for themselves. Where the record works, is in the composition of the six majestic tracks, tracks whose individual sections flow into each other almost magically just as well as the tracks evolve into each other. The composed music turns out to be an uphill task, both for the players to play and listeners to digest, so very technically challenging and profound does it get; a complex layer upon layer and layer after layer of smoothly evolving notes flowing smoothly as the waves of a calm ocean. It may be technical, but \u201cmindless wankery\u201d are definitely not the two words that can describe the music as it encompasses the emotions in the lyrics of the songs very perfectly. The six tracks presented are highly consistent in excellence of their quality so that this very well might be their most consistent effort since the masterpiece Awake. \n\nAmong the individual tracks, I would like to single out A Nightmare To Remember and The Count Of Tuscany to heave most of my praise upon. The opener, A Nightmare To Remember, plays with genres and bends them to its will, as in the space of 16 minutes it goes from its atmospheric opening to a choppy and even thrashy section which then evolves into an almost psychedelic part which then transforms into a blast beat section, with all of the above said transitions composed and executed with a flair of such professionalism as was seldom seen. The Count of Tuscany features some of best composed instrumental sections and structures throughout the band\u2019s career with an exceedingly catchy middle section. I would also like to single out The Best of Times for its emotive lyrics and an out-of-the-world guitar solo by John Petrucci towards the end. \n\nBlack Clouds and Silver Linings is highly recommended for fans leaning more towards the progressive side of the genre. The album is strong in its composition, rich in its musical variety and consistent in its quality and is sure is a great and fulfilling musical achievement in annals of the band.\n",
        "\nSo, after the release of Systematic Chaos under the Roadrunner Records label, it seems that the DT history has stretched well over 2 decades that it was finally decided that they would be releasing a compilation album.\n\nPersonally, this album ain't nothing to recommend for any other than casual listeners who would like to get an insight of what Dream Theater has been about during their times stretching all the way to Octavarium. I believe the \"Light Side\" will appeal to those who are non-metal fans as every track in there seem to be ready for air-play, while the \"Dark Side\" is a collection of heavier and more progressive tracks (including that \"greatest hit\" being popularly known from \"Images And Words\".)\n\nThe remix tracks of \"Pull Me Under\", \"Take The Time\" and \"Another Day\" are almost the same as the original tracks. I say \"almost\" because the tracks for this compilation have been mixed a bit louder and clearer, not to mention a minor rearrangement of the latter track's sax solo. But one other particular difference, what most of the listeners/reviewers may have never mentioned: Mike Portnoy's drums have been rerecorded on these tracks, eliminating the drum trigger sounds on the snare and kicks, thus making justice to his intended production ideals.\n\nThe selection of tracks and the categorization going between the two discs are pretty well thought out, if yet for the sake of inviting new listeners in. The Dark Side disc has a number of tracks that leave the clues about how DT's sound from each of the albums have changed, in a chronological order. Not all final selections are particularly the best but it works for me. As for The Light Side, it's just a matter of taste when it comes to ballads and songs in poppier formats.\n\nAs I am aware of, this compilation album been recieving a great deal of complaints from some fans because it didn't include the most essential songs that defined Dream Theater as progressive as they have truly been. That's much to Mike Portnoy's dismay, who helped arrange the tracks on this compilation, as he weren't allowed by the label to produce a third disc that was intended for epic, progressive songs on it. So you won't find classic tracks such as \"Metropolis Pt. 1\", \"Learning To Live\" or \"Space-Dye Vest\" on this.\n\nFans that are well familiar to this band won't likely find this compilation particularly special; the remix tracks aren't worth it any more than what you can get for the originals on Images And Words and so are the unnecessary radio edits on a number of songs (regardless if it helps make room for more songs in there). It only makes it worthwhile if you are new to Dream Theater and want an easy-going synopsis of their musical career, especially if you aren't a fan of prog. But if you are, I'd rather recommend you checking the full-length albums to find the actual gems that aren't included in this release. Your call!\n",
        "\nAfter the dark and gripping Black Clouds & Silver Linings and the lighter and more diversified A Dramatic Turn Of Events, I was hopeful for the new self-titled Dream Theater release, and was excited to see in which new direction this output would go. I was equally curious to hear how Mike Mangini would be integrated. I was looking forward to see John Myung taking up more space than before in terms of musical presence and song writing qualities. And finally, of course, I was hoping for new musical ecstasy from guitarist and main songwriter John Petrucci, front man and singer James LaBrie, and creative keyboardist Jordan Rudess.\n\nThe new output only introduces a few new elements to the Dream Theater universe. The opening instrumental \u201cFalse Awakening Suite\u201d will take the place of other cinematic overtures the band has used as samples to start their concerts with. Their very personal overture is cinematic and concise and just sounds fine. The band decided to close the record with a laid-back and sadly unfitting and unspectacular hidden instrumental at the end of \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d, which somehow tries to close the circle. Let\u2019s also mention another instrumental called \u201cEnigma Machine\u201d. New drummer Mike Mangini and bassist John Myung (who has been rather passive over the past few years) finally find their time and place to shine in this song, which is one of the best on the album.\n\nThe rest of the album offers nothing new, but rather a mixture of different band phases. So your appreciation will really depend upon whether or not you like the connected phases of the band. The dark and sometimes too-technical first single \u201cThe Enemy Inside\u201d could have come from Systematic Chaos. The warmer \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d goes back to the Awake sound, and is clearly inspired by bands like progressive rock legends Rush. \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d has symphonic elements, piano passages, soothing vocals, and a ballad-driven sound. However, it\u2019s combated by the poor-fitting harder sections. This kind of half-ballad would have found its justified place on records like Metropolis Part Two and Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence. Fans of laid-back progressive rock sounds of the seventies by Genesis or Yes should adore \u201cBehind The Veil\u201d, which has a darker tone close to \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d without reaching its class. The more laid-back sound could also please fans of the underestimated Falling Into Infinity. \u201cSurrender To Reason\u201d could also fit that release, and should appeal to fans of progressive rock bands like King\u2019s X or Pendragon. It\u2019s a calmer but technical piece of music with a few magic melodies and moments.\n\nMoving on to the last couple of tracks, \u201cAlong For The Ride\u201d is another appeasing Dream Theater half-ballad dominated by LaBrie\u2019s soft vocals, acoustic guitars, and great bass guitar work and beautiful keyboard passages in the middle part. This kind of song has a touch of Awake, but could also have been a leftover from A Dramatic Turn Of Events. Then comes the closing \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d, with a running time of over twenty-two minutes, including the hidden closure I\u2019ve already told you about. Musically, this track calls to mind Metropolis Part Two. As always, such a long song has its ups and downs. The mysterious sound collages with nature noises that appear seven and a half minutes into the track remind me of Mike Oldfield\u2019s amazing \u201cMusic From The Balcony\u201d, for example. What then follows are parts inspired by classic music like Muse used to do on their last two albums. These parts in the final song are cinematic, epic, and touching. The rest is technically appealing but sounds a bit directionless.\n\nWhile there are a lot of positive things to point out, such as the calm arrangements, the stunning keyboards, and the strong bass guitar work, there are also a number of mentionable drawbacks to Dream Theater. In fact, I really didn\u2019t like this record as much as the two previous ones. First of all, almost all tracks feel lengthy and stretched. Concise song writing and shorter songs would have helped. The final \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d would have been a gripping song around the seven or eight minute mark, but twenty-two minutes are far too long and offer too many changes and too much instrumental masturbation. That\u2019s also the case for the faster, hectic and very technical parts in \u201cThe Enemy Inside\u201d, \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d, and even the instrumental \u201cEnigma Machine\u201d. Another negative aspect is that I was able to relate each track to a certain Dream Theater record. This means that the band doesn\u2019t really offer anything new at all. There isn\u2019t much progression going, and the band digs in its own successful past. That\u2019s not a big problem because they have written some progressive metal masterpieces, but I was expecting more creative input. My favorite songs here are \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d followed by \u201cSurrender To Reason\u201d. The two instrumentals are quite good, and the rest is somewhere between good and a comparatively boring average. Those who already have albums such as Awake, Metropolis Part Two and Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence don\u2019t really need this record, as it shows nothing new or better than these.\n\nIn the end, I would only recommend this album to faithful Dream Theater fans. It\u2019s a good but not a spectacular album and some things could have been done better. After the last two records, this album is a little letdown. I\u2019m complaining at a very high level though. Maybe the tracks are working better in concert. This being sad, the band will release a new live package from their last tour entitled \u201cLive At Luna Park\u201d by the end of the year. If I had to choose between the new album and the live package, I would save my money for the live package.\n\nOriginally written for Black Wind Metal\n",
        "\nFollowing Mike Portnoy\u2019s departure, Dream Theater put out the somewhat uneven \u201cA Dramatic Turn of Events.\u201d It was well documented that the album had been written prior to auditioning drummers. The drums were mixed lower, and there was a fair amount of filler. Nonetheless, it provided a hint of things to come. Songs like \u201cThis is the Life\u201d and \u201cOutcry\u201d were the bombastic, melodramatic songs one would expect from a prog band.\n\nTheir recent, self-titled album is a continuation of the grandiosity they were going for with ADTOE. It opens with the cinematic \u201cFalse Awakening Suite\u201d before kicking into gear with the angular attack of the post-traumatic stress disorder inspired \u201cThe Enemy Inside.\u201d Things then get interesting with \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d, a clear homage to Rush that begins with a similar tonality to Limelight. Dream Theater has never been known for writing anthemic songs, so this is a breath of fresh air. They don\u2019t quite do so with the vigor and craftsmanship of their heroes, but the straightforward structure and breathtaking solo from John Petrucci carry this one. Then, there is the first instrumental in quite some time, \u201cEnigma Machine.\u201d Though Mike Mangini puts on a clinic (and the drums are mixed much higher than the previous album), this songs fails to find its footing due to a lack of a memorable melody or driving rhythm. It simply meanders along for six minutes.\n\nThe next few songs employ the services of keyboardist Jordan Rudess prominently. \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d builds up to an arena rock chorus, buoyed by Keyboards that wouldn\u2019t be out of place on Van Halen\u2019s 5150. \u201cBehind the Veil\u201d attempts the same thing, but is not nearly as well constructed. James LaBrie\u2019s aggressive vocals are just as goofy as they were on Train of Thought and the chorus is not as rewarding. The keyboards strike a nicer balance with the guitar on \u201cSurrender to Reason.\u201d Petrucci lets his guitar sing on this one, and the results are astounding.\n\nThe two songs that finish the album are perhaps the most interesting. \u201cAlong for the Ride\u201d is the best instrumental they have done since \u201cHollow Years.\u201d Strange enough, neither one of those songs has a guitar solo. The keyboard solo is somewhat cheesy, but the song is well written and incredibly catchy. Finally, the album ends with the ambitious, orchestral \u201cIllumination Theory.\u201d This song has the largest dynamic shifts, alternating between the incredible rhythmic display the band is known for and strong melodies. The orchestral middle section is very cool, as is the start-stop riffing that reminds me of Cygus X-1 after that. Finally, they let James LaBrie hit the high notes on the closing section, which he surprisingly sounds really good on!\n\nIf there is a large complaint to be made, it must be for the banal lyrics. Although the musicianship is incredible, one cannot help but cringe at the lyrics. Illumination Theory is a song about what people will live, kill or die for:\n\nMothers for their children\nHusbands for their wives\nMartyrs for the kingdom\nFighting for your life\nA soldier for his country\nA junkie for the high\nTeachers for their students\nVengeance for a crime\n\nThis is a microcosm of what plagues the rest of the album and a lot of their discography. Though the music is extremely well-written, the lyrics are not.\n\nDespite this flaw (which is not particular to this album), the outstanding, creative songwriting and musicianship are worth the price of admission. It will be interesting to see where the future takes this band, as it is only the first album with Mike Mangini as a participating member of the band.\n",
        "\nI wasn't around to remember or experience it, but there was once a blissful time when progressive metal wasn't always associated with excessive keyboards and guitar masturbation. This was the era when progressive metal typically meant heavy or power metal with progressive elements; bands like (early) Queensryche and Fates Warning, Crimson Glory and Sacred Blade, before the very late 80s and early 90s when progressive metal started to change into a different beast. A few bands are known as pioneers of this style; Norway's Conception, Fates Warning (post-No Exit) and of course today's topic, Dream Theater. While Dream Theater aren't necessarily more culpable for the start of this modern brand of prog than Conception or Fates Warning are, they are more irritating to me because unlike the other two bands, not only did they never really produce anything worthwhile, they're also one of the worst offenders of the genre (and I've listened to a lot of it).\n\nTheir 1989 debut When Dream and Day Unite is, thankfully, more worthwhile than any of their other material, with few sections that are actively irritating and some that are even marginally enjoyable. It is a very groundbreaking and somewhat influential album - which in this case means the heaps and heaps of modern prog bullshit to come in the years ahead. While the album itself is fairly harmless, what it inspired is much, much worse. However, let's get on to the music itself. Even in 1989, wimpy, largely ball-less prog metal wasn't terribly uncommon; Queensryche's Rage for Order, Fifth Angel's self-titled, and some largely Queensryche-derivative bands like Gehenna, Drive, and Scarlet Rayne were around. However, one thing none of these bands was the prominent keyboard presence on When Dream and Day Unite, nor did any of them take the progressive aspects to such an extreme degree.\n\nThis album is fairly dense and can be bewildering on first listen with the constant changes and numerous simultaneous elements; in this way it is like Fates Warning's Awaken the Guardian, Slauter Xstroyes' Winter Kill, or Psychotic Waltz's A Social Grace from the following year. Like A Social Grace, it's hard to put this into a specific subgenre besides the highly nebulous \"progressive metal\" tag; if I had to do so I would call it symphonic heavy metal with progressive rock and power metal elements, but that's quite a mouthful, so I'll call it \"modern prog,\" to differentiate it from bands which also fall into the progressive metal category but aren't in the same style (the aforementioned Psychotic Waltz, Voivod, later Holocaust). The weird thing about this album (for its time) is that, as I mentioned, the keyboards are very prevalent; as prevalent as the guitars in some sections, more so in many others. The production is also quite wimpy, so as to accommodate for the strong keyboard and vocal presence, with slick, muted guitars that don't do any respectable metal album justice.\n\nVocalist Charlie Dominici is technically good, hitting all the right notes, and has a fair amount of charisma, but his performance is even less ballsy than that of (late 80s) Geoff Tate and his imitators (Lethal's Tom Mallicoat, Screamer's Bill Carter, etc.). Tate's introduction to metal in '82 surprised everyone, as he had classical training and went for a cleaner, more operatic style, but this is a step further. I don't know a lot of rock singers from that era very well, but to give the best comparison I can, Dominici sounds sort of like a lamer Geddy Lee. Not to bash Geddy Lee - Dominici is much wimpier than Lee, who works well with most of Rush's material - I just don't know prog rock and Lee is the first person who came to mind. I'd be surprised if there weren't some Rush influence in the music as well - there's obvious prog rock influence - but I don't know Rush's material well enough to pick out any specific albums or anything.\n\nThe sad thing to me about this album is that the songwriting is actually pretty decent throughout - the vocal lines are good, the guitar riffs are often fairly good, but the vocalist sucks and the lame pseudo-epic keyboard lines drown out the guitars most of the time. Had they cut they keyboard wankery and gone with a real metal vocalist like John Stewart (Slauter Xstroyes), this could've been a fairly cool album, but as it is, it just feels too bloated, saccharine, and flaccid most of the time. The lyrics are also quite shit, with pseudo-intellectual vomit like \"A trifling euphoria was such an untimely religion\" and \"Visions still surviving in a logic-proof shell\", and when they're not trying to be intellectual, they're talking about some lame personal struggle or some such shit - boring as fuck.\n\nStill, despite its shortcomings, the album is not without its merits. As I said, the riffs and vocal lines are often good, and occasionally even the keyboards won't utterly suck, creating a triumphant feel such as at the end of \"Only a Matter of Time\" or sort of mysterious as on \"The Ytse Jam\" (which, being mostly guitar focused and lacking Dominici, is easily my favorite track here). The song moods are typically melancholic and/or romantic, often both in the same song, pretty understandable considering the lyrical content but not really my bag; the keyboards, lyrics, and vocals together just completely castrate the album most of the time, relinquishing it of all power it might have had and turning it into an instrument wank-fest. Not as badly as subsequent Dream Theater efforts, but still, not what you really want to hear out of metal. Overall the album is pretty mediocre, with enough redeeming qualities to keep it from being painful but never rising above its choking failures. I would not advise anyone to check out this or any other Dream Theater album, ever, but if you really have some burning desire to listen to the band, this one is your best bet.\n",
        "\nDream Theater has been my favorite band for the past 20 plus years. For the longest time I felt like they could do no wrong. Sure they would hit a snag here and there and have a song or two I wouldn't enjoy, but all in all their albums are some of my favorite ever released. Then we get to the whole ordeal with Mike Portnoy leaving the band. I understand where he was coming with wanting to take a break to refresh themselves. This is where it was pointed out to me that they really did need a break. Despite a Grammy nomination, I was not thoroughly impressed with hardly any of Dramatic Turn of Events. It just seemed like an overly drawn out album where after a few minutes you look down at your cd timer and realize you're almost done with the album and don't remember hardly any of it. Also I considered the album title and cover to be extremely childish. When I heard they were putting out a self-titled album after all these years, I was expecting it to be the biggest disappointment of their career. Somehow though the album managed to already grip me much better after only one listen.\n\nAs I sat down with the album and looked inside the booklet I didn't know what to think to see that there were only 9 tracks, two of which were instrumentals and another which was over 20 minutes. I felt this could be a good thing, considering my problem with their previous was too many tracks and too much filler. Beginning with the first actual song Enemy Inside I was extremely confused at first. There were far too many djent-ish riffs for me. I was really hoping Dream Theater wasn't becoming like the new school prog bands that Petrucci seems to enjoy now. Once the vocals begin, I couldn't even tell this was Dream Theater. Honestly, I thought this was Dave Mustaine and I was checking out the new Megadeth album. James Labrie's vocals just seemed to be sang directly through his nose. Once I started hearing Mike Mangini's amazing drum rolls I started getting into the track a little more. Once it gets to the solo I became extremely impressed. This is the Dream Theater that I've missed. It is extremely memorable, melodic, has plenty of speed and technicality, and ultimately fits the song great. The more I listen to this track, the more I like it. Originally I thought of it as a sleeper track, but now I am glad to see it was nominated for a Grammy.\n\nThe Looking Glass is by far my favorite song off the past two albums and I consider to be some of their best work to date. Being in the true spirit of progressive metal they experiment with a slight genre change. This track is pretty much in the vein of AOR and melodic rock and is very focused around being positive and having a memorable chorus. It a pretty standard track musically until about the 2:20 point where the band just lets loose technically and lets you know why they have been the premier progressive metal band for all of these years. Once again the guitar solo is extremely tastefully done. It is not extremely warp speed or anything, but definitely has a lot of emotion to it and once again fits the song very nicely. This track is something I'd very much like to see from the band more in the future.\n\nAdmitting that I'm not typically a big fan of instrumentals is my way of looking past Enigma Machine. By no means is it a bad track, but a lot of it comes off as technical wankery for the sake of technical wankery. It slows down at some points, but all in all its not very memorable unlike Ytse Jam and Dance of Eternity type instrumentals. Ultimately this is going to be a track I probably skip every time.\n\nI am personally a big fan of tracks that are half ballad yet still maintain a fair amount of technical musicianship and a memorable chorus as to not bore me into wanting to skip the track. The Bigger Picture is just that, in the fact that it is a fantastic track, and one of the few points of the album where Labrie's voice actually goes slightly higher. I realize his range isn't quite the same, but here his voice still sounds phenomenal. Like the previous track, once again we have a rather slow guitar solo filled with emotion. I also really like Jordan Ruddess's piano playing in this. Over the past album his keyboarding has gotten to the point of being so technical yet strange that a lot of it hasn't fit the songs that well. This album for the most part has been a drastic improvement on making the keyboards more listenable. The track ends like several have on previous albums in giving reference to songs they have previously done. The last vocal lines bring back parts from the track Home, which also has been one of my favorites of theirs for years.\n\nThe next track is where a few snags begin to take place. It takes almost a minute and a half for the track to kick in. The main guitar riff is extremely distorted, Labrie has some strange effect on his voice that almost makes him sound like Mustaine again, and the chorus is slightly repetitive. The song is definitely saved by the fact that the keyboard and guitar solos are amazing. Petrucci's playing on this track is quite possibly some of the best on the album. Once again it kicks back into the chorus and then fades out for another minute. It is definitely not a bad track, but probably could have stood to be a little shorter.\n\nThe beginning of the next track actually reminds me of an acoustic Opeth song. When the song kicks in we have some pretty technical riffs that lead into a little bit of chugging, but nothing too grating. After the first chorus is some of my favorite style of clean and melodic guitar leads followed by some choir vocal effects and one of the first parts where you actually pay attention to how extremely technical the bass playing is on this album. All in all this is another slower paced track, which there are a few on the album, but its nothing worth complaining about. Once again another memorable track that I don't want to skip.\n\nAlong for the Ride once again carries on with the idea of an album full of slower tracks. Being the most ballad like it definitely fares better than some of their previous attempts, which have essentially just been Labrie singing with maybe a little bit of acoustic guitar or piano. I do love the keyboard solo to this. The effect used is very similar to the main riff to Solitary Shell and just comes out sounding really positive and happy. Honestly I really like the message to this track, which is pretty much telling you that you shouldn't be too upset when things don't come out like you want them because everything will be okay in the end. \n\nLong epic tracks is something Dream Theater has been known for. Ever since releasing Change of Seasons as a single 23 minute track they have prided themselves on their ability carry on a single song idea for an extended period of time. Illumination Theory begins with some very distorted guitars on top of clean keyboards and then kicks in to be one of the more upbeat tracks on the album already. Some of the riffs to this once again come out sounding like some darker Opeth tracks, which is definitely not a bad things to me. It takes about 4 minutes before you get to any vocals. Honestly this part is where it starts to go wrong for me. The vocals sound very weak, almost like it belongs on Labrie's newest solo album. It is a bit too modern sounding for me and is kind of seems like a pointless attempt at a 50 year old man being edgy. From the 7th to 11th minute of the song there are virtually no instruments and seems kind of like a filler point. After this Labrie lets out some of his highest vocal attempts on the album. At points they seem alright and at other points they just seem to fail. Then we get to the point of the random prog rock jam session and then another 4 minutes of fade out. I honestly think this track is a complete dud and drags down the rest of the album.\n\nAll in all I am very impressed with Dream Theater's efforts on this album. A lot of it is a little slower paced, it does have 2 instrumental tracks, and their attempt at being epic came out a bit weak, but I must admit the guitar solos are phenomenal, the choruses are catchy, the songs are memory, and you don't just sit there looking at your watch waiting for the album to end. I really hope the band takes the positive aspects of this album and uses it to focus on making another masterpiece with their next album.\n\nOriginally written for The Metal Pit.\n",
        "\nI'm certain I'm not the first to notice this, but it appears that self-titled albums that are not a group's debut album rarely work out well. There are few people who would deny the influence and rightfully deserved legacy of debut self-titled works by Black Sabbath, Bathory, Deicide, or Iron Maiden. There are far fewer who would extol the virtues of the late-career eponymous records of, say, Cryptopsy or Suffocation. Those latter records are far from terrible, but there's little about them that makes them noteworthy. Yes, it's cherry picking, and there are certainly counterexamples, but in general late-career self-titled records display a lack of creativity by the creators. As one might expect, when Dream Theater announced that their next album was to be titled Dream Theater, I was not impressed.\n\nI will admit that I like the simple, dark cover. I find it a welcome change from the heavy but often blunt and saccharine symbolism the band usually deploys. To Dream Theater's credit, they've always been a reasonably consistent group. After hearing a few of their records, it's unlikely for the listener to be surprised by the contents of any of their other works. Courtesy of that consistency, they've also been fortunate over their lengthy career to have never released a truly dismal album. And to put all these pieces together, as would be expected of an album to which I've already delivered the backhanded insult of lacking creativity, Dream Theater's self-titled record is, roughly, more of the same. It's prog in the vein of all of their other works. It has many of the same styles and features of other Dream Theater records. It's a respectable album, but it lacks distinction.\n\nThere are few surprises to be found here, but there aren't many sour spots, either. The opening track is an instrumental along the same lines as Overture 1928 or the first movement of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. This, honestly, is one of the things Dream Theater does best. The song is brief, with steady forward motion. Compared to their other offerings, it's relatively unpredictable. It grabs the ear's attention and gives the album a promising start. The pitfall comes when we head to the next track. Although Dream Theater has never released an album that was aggressively terrible, the same cannot be said for individual songs, especially in the cases of their various forays into more \"accessible\" territory. \"The Enemy Inside\" is far from an awful song, but it sounds contrived. It's difficult for me to listen to the melodramatic lyrics and the unconvincing riffs without thinking that it was composed as some sort of compromise between their good material and the abominable remains of the band's previous attempts to write contemporary singles. Such vapid time-wasting is obligatory on Dream Theater records today, courtesy of their current label.\n\nFortunately, with that bullshit out of the way, we get to hear Dream Theater being Dream Theater for remainder of the record. Paying homage to one of their strongest influences, \"The Looking Glass\" sounds so much like a Rush cover that I had to check if Rush ever recorded a song with the same name to make sure it wasn't a cover. It isn't, but it's a spot-on imitation. The relatively broad tone and style of Rush is encountered several more times on this album. \"Enigma Machine\" is another instrumental that is absolutely typical of what Dream Theater does as a band. The riffs are wacky, the solos are wanky, and it's just barely conceivable that in a slightly different universe, Rush could have composed this one, too.\n\nThe next four tracks all wander in roughly similar territory, with all four of them featuring extended slow passages and plenty of open room for LaBrie to sing. \"Behind the Veil\" is the best of these, featuring a nifty ambient symphonic intro laced with some sounds that could possibly be an homage to late Pink Floyd records. The song's main riff has a few low tones that sound like they came directly out of the Awake/A Change of Seasons era, which are a delight to hear. The final track, the obligatory \"epic\" of the album, is thoroughly enjoyable. Like much of the album, it plays like a highlight reel from Dream Theater's earlier works. The opening third or so of the song is consistently strong, and return after the interlude is almost certainly the best few minutes on this album. The song lags in a few spots, notably the symphonic section in the interlude (which is not as strong as the ambient synth section) and the legato passages at the end of the main song, which go on for perhaps a bit too long and lack sufficient emotion to pull off that kind of duration.\n\nAwkwardly, the thing I remembered the most about this album after I first heard it months ago was the two and a half minutes at the very end, the piano outro. With enough silence separating it from the rest of \"Illumination Theory\" to essentially qualify it as a hidden track, it is two and a half minutes of strange, beautiful music. It is, I think, the only two and a half minutes on this record in which the band truly and adequately expresses themselves. It plays like an elegy, a monument to what the band has achieved in their long and illustrious career. Quite frankly, if these were the final notes that Dream Theater ever recorded as a band, I would be happily content. \n\nThis album, as a whole, plays like a tribute to what Dream Theater has accomplished. The band has received some criticism for that, but I'm willing to cut them some slack. Their fan base (myself included) is notoriously impossible to please. When they try to change their style, even if only for one song, the fans complain that their new direction sucks. When they release material that is similar to what they have released before, much like this album, the fans complain that they lack creativity. We don't expect Dream Theater to release good albums; we expect them to release masterpieces. This album is not a masterpiece. It is, however, adequate, fitting, and thoroughly, wholly Dream Theater. I guess the title works after all.\n",
        "\nThere's no point doing an in depth analysis of the songs on this DVD. If you want to know about the actual musical content I suggest reading the reviews for Metropolis Pt 2: Scenes From a Memory. This DVD is a live representation of that album played in full, plus a few extra songs at the end.\n\nScenes From a Memory (I'll call it SFaM from now on) is a legendary album. A 77 minute progressive metal concept album dealing with love, deceit, revenge and murder in the context of regression therapy, it is Dream Theater's most ambitious album and one of the highlights of their career. Being a long and complex album it is not easily digestible and isn't necessarily one I'd listen to regularly, but when in the mood for it this album is a real treat. So how does it come across in a live setting? Brilliant, with a few minor issues.\n\nThe musical performance is truly astonishing, as we come to expect from Dream Theater. Mike Portnoy is a drum god, absolutely flawless but also looks like he's really enjoying himself. John Petrucci is on fire here, his lead guitar work being a particular highlight. The backing vocals of these two are pretty good for the most part too. John Myung's basslines hold it all together, business as usual as he plays in his typically efffortless manner. This is the first live DVD with Jordan Rudess (SFaM being his first DT album too) and his atmospheric keyboards as well as his lead work is a massive improvement on the Derek Sherinian years. Nothing against Sherinian, but I much prefer Rudess in DT. Finally, James LaBrie, he has his critics but his performance here is excellent. Apart from a few wobbly moments, he performs his vocals with great power and emotion. If you're a fan of LaBrie, he's on form here. If you don't like his voice, this won't change your opinion. Overall top notch performances from the band members.\n\nAs I said at the start of the review there's little point in a track by track review. The chances are you'll only watch this if you're a fan of SFaM so you'll know the material. The whole album is here and performed astoundingly well. I only have two problems with this performance:\n\nTheresa Thomason. I can't stand her voice! At least on the studio album she was used sparingly. Although she only appears twice on this live show, she's given more time to basically wail annoyingly. I don't like this style of singing at all. It conjures up comparisons to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston and frankly it makes me want to hack off my ears! I don't want to hear wailing female singers anywhere, least of all on a progressive metal album or live show. After reading that you can probably imagine my thoughts on the gospel choir during 'The Spirit Carries On'. Yeah, I didn't care for that either. I hate gospel music and it instantly gets skipped on any music DVD/show/film etc. I've heard that song live without all the backing wailing and it is so much better without it.\n\nMy other gripe is only a minor one. Dream Theater decided to fully realise this concept album by essentially making a video accompaniment to the music, acting out the story. It's pretty low budget. OK, I'm not expecting DT to finance Robert De Niro but even so, the acting is pretty poor. It's like a bad B-movie. A really bad one. Half the time it just features lyrics flashing up on screen. The DVD has some cool effects, particularly during 'Home' with it's psychedelic riffs fitting well with the flashy, spinning lights and the split camera work, reversed shots and such. Sadly, 'Finally Free' is spoiled by too much of this poor video being shown as the story comes to its grim conclusion. I'd rather watch the musicians to be honest.\n\nThe bonus features include a photo gallery, a documentary and some additional live footage. This includes a live performance of 'A Change of Seasons' which is a nice treat. Fairly minimal extras but decent enough.\n\nSo we've got a fantastic performance of a truly spellbinding album (apart from the gospel stuff), only flawed by a lack of budget failing to match the ambitious vision of the band. Definitely worth getting if you're a fan of Dream Theater, particularly if you love SFaM.\n",
        "\nThe awkward moment when i decide to review an album by my favourite band. I love Dream Theater. Not to the point where i think they can do no wrong but still the band i listen to more than any other. They've had their ups and downs and this album is the one immediately after the exit of Mike Portnoy. A notoriously divisive band losing their driving force was always going to spark huge debate among fans. So what does this album offer us?\n\nFirstly, like most Dream Theater albums this is long (77 minutes). However, unlike the previous album this has 10 tracks compared to just 6, with the longest song being 12 minutes and 3 others over 10 minutes. For those not in the know, this is actually pretty modest and scaled back for this band! There's also 2 much shorter ballads, a trick the band occasionally used in the past. There were a lot of comparisons with the classic 'Images and Words' album, including accusations that this album even followed the exact same song structures. I think it's fair to say this isn't truly progressive, Dream Theater very much just sound like themselves these days rather than truly push the boundaries of progressive metal. Playing the typical elements of prog doesn't automatically make it progressive, but getting rid of Portnoy's annoying vocals does make it good! 'Bridges in the Sky' is probably the most progressive and heavy track here with its peculiar intro and varied sections. Definitely a good opener for the tour that followed.\n\n'Black Clouds and Silver Linings' was an excellent album only marred by too many vocal contributions from a drummer who should stick to drumming. This album has pretty minimal backing vocals which are ably reproduced live by John Petrucci now. Speaking of JP, he also produced this and did a very good job of it. The bass is clearer than it has been in years, the drums don't smother everything else and the vocals are mostly left to an on-form James Labrie with only one annoying effect on 'Build Me Up, Break Me Down'. When i heard this song live it was noticeably better without the vocal effect, something they should avoid on future studio recordings. \n\nPetrucci's solos are fantastic throughout this album. The riffs are mostly excellent but sometimes sound like he's used them before. The solo in 'Breaking All Illusions' is easily his best ever, divided into parts showing off his full range of technique from flashy to emotional and melodic. The sort of playing where i'd proclaim 'best solo ever' when describing it to someone else after a few beers! Generally speaking, JP really brings some strong material to this album as the chief songwriter.\n\nJohn Myung's bass is thankfully much louder in the mix than on previous albums. Nothing flashy here, just his usual solid lines holding it all together. Mike Mangini's drumming is fine, the parts were already written by Petrucci and Rudess so he doesn't really provide anything other than a strong performance here. Buy the self titled album to hear his first proper contributions to the band, he's a great player. \n\nJordan Rudess sounds reborn here. No stupid noises or irritating ragtime parts here. More atmospheric parts and adding layers of depth to the music. He does play some lead parts too of course, notably a fantastic piano run in 'Outcry' which i just can't get enough of. i think Rudess needed the creative freedom of Portnoy's departure to really shine and offer something different.\n\nSpeaking of Portnoy, did the band really miss his contributions of songwriting/production, epic drumming and crappy vocals? Not really. Although Mangini doesn't really stand out on this album, i don't think Portnoy's over-drumming would benefit these songs. James Labrie truly dominates now that the shackles of those awful Portnoy vocals are gone. James belts these songs out with power and range not heard in perhaps 15 years and he can do it live too. i saw them on this tour and he was the star of the show, not bad for the supposed weak link in this band. \n\nThis brings me to the songs themselves. The opening pair are excellent mid-length songs(by DT standards) with strong choruses. 'Lost Not Forgotten' is ok but overlong and nothing special. The next track is the first of 3 ballads. I don't have a problem with these songs but 2 would be enough and finishing the album with one is an odd climax. The other 3 tracks have already been mentioned above as they are the best on the album and deserved more focus. One final point, the lyrics are the usual nonsense this band is famous for but i think it is part of their charm.\n\nOverall, a strong album made after a very significant change in the group. Not perfect and the running order is a bit strange, but undoubtedly one of the stronger albums of their long career.\n\nRecommended tracks: On the Backs of Angels, Bridges in the Sky, Outcry, Breaking All Illusions\n",
        "\nWhat is Dream Theater to become in the wake of staggering recognition not normally heaped upon bands of a progressive nature? What are they to do next after monumental albums such as \"Awake\", \"Octavarium\" and \"Black Clouds and Silver Linings\"? Well, the answer put in front of us seems to be to write a safe as hell record and pass it off as the eponymous and definitive collection. The thing that continues to fascinate (and frustrate) about this band is how they remain \"progressive\" within the context of a song but how they as a band have not progressed much in the literal sense. There is nothing wildly experimental on \"Dream Theater\"-in fact, if you listen to this album and the previous one in succession you'd probably yawn midway given to how everything seems smartly packed and presented but never quite visceral or reactive. Of course, formula is something most bands build up over time but the trick is to stay as innovative as they possibly can within the confines they've established for themselves. Dream Theater operate with pomp and bombast on their twelfth studio album in what I guess we could call an inadvertent attempt to confuse the situation. All the nine tracks on this album sound \"big\" and stately but it doesn't take a nitpicker to notice that inherent to this grandiloquence are the same old trappings that have failed many a past Dream Theater album.\n\nThe album isn't without charm-in fact, it has lots of charm. The problem is that it's a case of too much, too soon. If this was the first we were hearing about Dream Theater, then this record would be some sort of milestone but the unfortunate benefit of hindsight renders it rather trite and quite underwhelming. Had they taken a bit more time with it and made it more basic than overly coloured, it would definitely make a bolder statement. Instead what we have is an album that falls neatly within the confines of the status quo. One that takes a few bold leaps but mostly conforms to the usual standard; the metal \"bruiser\" here, the ballad there and of course, the overlong, ultra dynamic, \"transcendental\" epic. It is better than \"Systematic Chaos\" and \"Train of Thought\" but in feel only because even the really good songs here have a stink of familiarity about them. \"The Bigger Picture\" for instance sounds like it dropped off \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" with its graceful swoops so characteristic of that record and you'd think as the group's first instrumental since 2003 that \"Enigma Machine\" wouldn't be so damned reminiscent of \"Erotamania\". It is 2013, and Dream Theater has still failed to break fresh ground. Those who dismissed \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" as an \"Images and Words\" re-write will be mollified only slightly by \"Dream Theater\"'s subtlety at replication.\n\nOpener \"False Awakening Suite\" has a texture that admits Therion to mind while \"The Enemy Inside\" is their worthiest metal bruiser yet. Maybe because it didn't feed off Metallica like the ones before it. The intro that leads into the first verse is very Nevermore in character but the dynamism and intricacy makes it entirely Dream Theater's. Generally speaking, the playing on this album is much more intricate than it was on the last two albums-there's so many moving parts, so many shades employed. This works brilliantly on songs like \"Surrender To Reason\" and \"Illumination Theory\" but fails to lift others like \"Behind The Veil\" and \"The Bigger Picture\" from their pit of blandness. John Petrucci and James LaBrie are overly busy throughout-the former plays some of his most distinctive solos yet (check the delectably chaotic one in \"Surrender To Reason\" and his soaring melodic eruption on \"Enigma Machine\") while LaBrie for his part, sings the hell out of those lyrics and the shamelessly Rushesque \"The Looking Glass\" is his finest moment. He is graceful and refined on the entire thing-maybe too refined at some point-but there's a genuine warmth to his tone that is endearing. Still the newbie, Mike Mangini lacks the boisterous charm of Portnoy and the theatricality with which the man managed his pounds. He is outshined and overshadowed and sounds a bit too far in the mix-mechanical, almost. But on \"Enigma Machine\" he really comes out to play, showcasing his technique as vastly as six minutes can allow. Jordan Rudess pretty much sounds as he did on the last record-mellow, less synthetic, more into defining a song's emotional features than flying off on some technical handle. And finally, John Myung is the silent man no more. His bass is firmly etched upon every moment and there's a clarity to his notes that's probably the only \"new\" thing on the whole album.\n\nLyrically, this is Dream Theater's weakest album. The topics are the same as they've always been. In other words, pedantic philosophical meanderings abound. There's a false tone to the words this time though that renders them both slick and insipid. On \"Bridges In The Sky\" two years ago, Petrucci was seeking enlightenment, here on \"The Bigger Picture\" the quest hasn't changed much albeit a little reality has seeped through the fantastical notions he nurtured back then (\"When I see the distant lights illuminate the night/Then I will know I am home\"). Prog rock bands have historically tended to draw us into the mild dramas of their spiritual searches but while Yes had a way with words, Petrucci's vocabulary fails him and presents his quests in the most innocuous manner possible. Look elsewhere and you meet with sentimentality (\"Along For The Ride\") and righteous indignation (\"Behind The Veil\"). Again, if this was Dream Theater's first or second album, the shabby prose might have looked appealing but the fact that they've penned better in the past makes this terribly mediocre. The band is to be given credit though for having carved a niche and still able to manipulate tat system of their own making to turn out sub masterpiece after sub masterpiece. If you're of the mind that they have nothing left to prove, then you'll enjoy this much more. It has that mature, brazen candor that only the grown and self aware possess. But if you're looking for something bold and new then in their own words; \"You won't find it here, look another way\".\n\nHow will it hold up in the catalog? I presume it will be lauded from here to kingdom come because of how grand it all sounds. But it lacks the freshness of \"Octavarium\", the balance of \"Black Clouds and Silver Linings\" and even the mature warmth of \"A Dramatic Turn Of Events\". For what it's worth, \"Surrender To Reason\" and \"The Looking Glass\" are thoroughly awesome tunes and nice additions to the more respectable side of Dream Theater's catalog. Even \"The Enemy Inside\" can be seen to eventually rival \"As I Am\" and \"Constant Motion\" for sheer metalness. The rest are mere farts on the skin of the wind packaged as rocks.\n",
        "\nThe build up to Dream Theater was both an exciting and worrying time for me. Their last album, A Dramatic Turn Of Events, ranked as a pinnacle in the Dream Theater discography, and on many levels, a return to form, with the band re-establishing itself sans drum extraordinaire Mike Portnoy, who was of course one of their main songwriters. I\u2019m often wary of self titled albums, as with many bands it signals a change in musical direction (Metallica, very nearly Stratovarius), and really I think it comes off kind of lazy. Furthering the doubt was the artwork, which when compared against the stunning pieces adorning their last two releases comes off as quite unspectacular.\n\nAny apprehension I might have had was, however, quickly quelled. The first thing which really stuck out to me here is how succinct the band comes off. Whilst the twenty plus minute closer \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d doesn\u2019t entirely apply to this point, the other eight tracks here are meticulously crafted slabs of concise progressive metal that show exactly what Dream Theater can do in a tight package. They very rarely indulge in the prolonged musical sections which they\u2019re by now known for, and even in the instrumental track \u201cEnigma Machine\u201d, the focus is more reliant on riffs and structure as opposed to showboating. Another big factor in their sound is that just about everything I would ever identify as having spawned from Mike Portnoy\u2019s influence and song-writing has been complete eschewed. The groovy, trendier sections are all but gone, and in their place is a multifaceted progressive power metal assault which hearkens back to the band\u2019s formative days.\n\nI also adore how in touch Dream Theater feels with its contemporaries. I can hear shades of acts such as Threshold, Symphony X, Pagan\u2019s Mind, and of course Rush throughout the entire album. When concerning the former three bands, I\u2019m not sure whether this was intentional, due to the arguable matter of how much Dream Theater influenced the aforementioned acts, however in the case of Rush, any Dream Theater fan can see the band has proudly worn that influence on their collective sleeve throughout its career.\n\nTaking a look at some of the songs, I feel this becomes even more evident; from the Symphony X styled opening piece \u201cFalse Awakening Suite\u201d to the Rush meets Pagan\u2019s Mind swagger of \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d, all the way up to the post-thrash, almost Threshold approach of \u201cBehind The Veil\u201d \u2013 and let\u2019s not forget \u201cErotomania\u2019s\u201d darker, meaner cousin; the aforementioned \u201cEnigma Machine\u201d. Dream Theater are on the ball with every aspect of their sound here on their eponymous twelfth full-length. The heavier segments are propulsive and convincing; with killer riffs and double kick patterns, and their tranquil moments are poignant: largely carried via LaBrie\u2019s smooth croon and Petrucci\u2019s impeccable clean guitar playing. Despite sounding focused and concise, there is still plenty of room for Dream Theater\u2019s progressive aspects, and despite shorter song lengths, for the most part they manage to dazzle throughout their arrangements.\n\nSome special mention should go out to \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d too, without a doubt one of the stronger twenty plus minute numbers I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of listening to. What\u2019s particularly great about it is that it\u2019s relatively easy to follow and grasp. The individual parts feel distinct, and the bridging string section is nothing short of moving. LaBrie is really on the money here too, playing to his strengths as a singer and delivering one of his finest performances in years.\n\nSpeaking of fine performances, it\u2019s great to hear Mike Mangini fully integrated into the writing process, and it shows. I\u2019d say this is their most air drum-worthy release since Awake. His performance is intense to say the least; incredible fills, energetic double kick flurries, and of course some damn catchy beats. The enigmatic John Myung compliments Mangini in the rhythm department, and boy does he make his presence felt here. I\u2019ve lost count of how much air-bass I\u2019ve done to this album, and in places his tone and performance take a lot from Geddy Lee, which had me smiling from ear to ear. He also contributes the lyrics to \u201cSurrender To Reason\u201d which is great, as I\u2019ve always been a big fan of the songs he\u2019s penned.\n\nFor the rest of the band it\u2019s largely business as usual: John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess have pretty much stepped into the ring-leader position vacated by Portnoy, and it\u2019s great to see them putting in both humble and honest performances. Rudess is surprisingly restrained throughout the album, and whilst his skill is intimidating as ever, I feel he utilizes his talents to the flow and benefit of the songs, as opposed to anything excessive. I feel Petrucci\u2019s riffs draw a lot of inspiration from that of the earlier Dream Theater albums, and I\u2019d definitely say he puts forth one of his more riff oriented approaches here on their eponymous album. His lead guitars are decidedly more memorable this time around too, doing a great job of conveying emotion. This is particularly true in \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d, where he delivers a thoroughly stirring solo towards the end.\n\nWith fantastic sound and some of the finest songs the band has penned in years, I feel Dream Theater is an incredibly strong release, and likely the biggest candidate for prog album of the year. Just when I thought they couldn\u2019t get any better, they throw the gauntlet down yet again. To me, Dream Theater feels like the start of a new era for the band, a proud \u201cthis is who we are\u201d kind of album, which I hope will serve as the foundation for furthering their style and sound. An all-encompassing look at Dream Theater, served up in a deliciously neat package, this one comes highly recommended.\n\nOriginally written for http://blackwindmetal.com\n",
        "\nSome may deem them uncreative, but self-titled albums often have interesting purposes in a band\u2019s discography. Unless it is released as a group\u2019s debut, a self-titled album usually suggests a dramatic change of direction or serves as a statement of their core tenets. Like A Dramatic Turn Of Events before it, Dream Theater\u2019s twelfth studio effort and second with drummer Mike Mangini aims to be your quintessential Dream Theater album but has a few elements that set it apart from that particular release.\n\nWhile the appropriately symphonic \u201cFalse Awakening Suite\u201d and lead single \u201cThe Enemy Within\u201d initially hint at a heavier, more theatrical direction, the bulk of Dream Theater is actually driven by the tropes that defined efforts such as Octavarium and Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence. The influence of other bands is back on their sleeves as \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d and \u201cSurrender to Reason\u201d channel the pep of early 80s Rush while \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d and \u201cAlong For The Ride\u201d serves as the token ballads. Elsewhere, \u201cEnigma Machine\u201d is the first instrumental to be seen since the Train Of Thought days and \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d is another one of the band\u2019s beloved twenty-minute epics.\n\nThe musicians also offer their typical virtuosities though the dynamic seems to be shaken up a bit. John Petrucci\u2019s guitars and Jordan Rudess\u2019s effects continue to assert their dominance and the drums have integrated well enough, but bassist John Myung appears to be the album\u2019s standout contributor as his performance is his most energetic since Falling Into Infinity. On the flip side, James LaBrie\u2019s vocal performance will continue to divide listeners though there are a few signs of slippage that even the most dedicated of fanboys will notice. He still works well with the material but the cringe-worthy wails during the climaxes of \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d threaten to derail an otherwise solid closer.\n\nBut for an album that features shorter song lengths and a less than seventy minute run time, it is strange to note that its biggest flaw is a lack of true catchiness. Detractors have always been quick to identify Dream Theater as a band only capable of endless wanking and cornier lyrics, but they have known how to craft a good chorus and have many a grand riff in their repertoire. A few tracks like \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d and \u201cBehind The Veil\u201d do come close to reaching this point, but most of the songs are rather interchangeable despite the album\u2019s variety. They\u2019re still good enough but aren\u2019t as memorable as usual.\n\nOverall, Dream Theater\u2019s self-titled venture is a solid release that mixes good songs with a looming threat of stagnancy. It might not be a bad idea for the band to consider recharging their batteries in the near future, but a return to a heavier sound or even entertaining the idea of another concept album could make for an equally satisfying remedy. There is still some enjoyment to be found here but it\u2019d be best to get the new albums by Queensryche and Fates Warning if you want to hear the old prog metal elite at its best.\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cFalse Awakening Suite\u201d\n\u201cThe Enemy Inside\u201d\n\u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d\n\u201cBehind the Veil\u201d\n\u201cIllumination Theory\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://psychicshorts.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nFirst of all let me begin by saying that this album breaks Dream Theater's recent not so good albums. Im talking about Black Clouds and Silver Linings and A Dramatic Turn of Events. Those albums were crap. Systematic Chaos was tolerable at first, but it eventually grew on me. In that sense, that is what this album seems to be.\n\nUpon listening to the opening track, 'False Awakening Suite' I got my hopes up. I couldn't wait to hear the rest of the album in my anticipation. Then began the track 'The Enemy Inside.' Unlike most, I chose not to listen to it when they released it as a single before the rest of the album. Thinking back, that was definetly the correct decision as that was the heaviest track on the album. Some parts of it screamed 'Nevermore' at me.\n\nThe rest of the album felt rather mediocre to be honest. Nothing jumped out from the speakers and grabbed my head and stuck there forever. In other words, it was very bland and plain. Not much was going for it. They haven't played outside the square here. Technically, they are brilliant. Not many bands come close to Dream Theater's technical prowess on their respective instuments.\n\nLet me now focus on the individual performances in the album. I never really liked James LaBrie. Some songs he was good, but often his high pitched wails left a sour taste in my ears. In this album, he doesn't do much. I will put that down to age. He doesn't push himself with the vocals too much. For most, this is good.\n\nJohn Petrucci has always been technically one of the best. Melodic like Joe Satriani with the speed and precision faster than the likes of Yngwie Malmsteen and Jeff Loomis. There is everything, from smooth legato runs, his signature untouchable alternate picking shredding runs, even a few sweeps here and there. What ever the speed, it sounds clean whether played at 20 or 200bpm. This album proves nothing more. He is a great guitarist.\n\nAs with Petrucci, Myung really delivers. If you have listened to their demos back from the Majesty days you can always hear the bass. It was one of their predominant sounds on their demos pre Dream Theater. Who ever mixed/engineered the album really did a fantastic job. The bass guitar is audible and strong. Now more than ever the listener is able to listen to Myung show his stuff on the bass. He compliments Petrucci extremely well. Not only doubling behind the guitar, but also playing some good melodies and in some tracks, solos too! You can hear some in 'Enigma Machine' where he has some tones that scream RUSH! (The prog rock band, fyi)\n\nRudess is a unique keyboard player in the way that I have never heard someone play keyboards the way he does. I don't know much about playing keyboards, but when he decides to go fast he backs Petrucci with ease. I didn't like his overuse of effects. Sounded a tad nu-metally to me, which is a slight disappointment.\n\nHowever, Mangini lets this album down. Technically, he is far superior to Portnoy and he shows that in quite a few of his fills that make you go 'damn, this guy is really good!' And he is! Sadly however, his performance left much to be desired. I'm not 100% sure on how to say this, but here goes. When Portnoy got going, he was able to take a rhythm and nurse it perfectly through the entire song amid all the tempo and time changes. His transitions in particular were fantastic. Now he hasn't got the technical prowess of Mangini, but he played the drums with soul and passion. Mangini sounds robotic. He executes his fills and technical sentions perfectly. However what let me down is his transitions. I would be listening to a section that is good and the BAM he changes beat without much of a transition. When he did have a transition, it lacked the groove that Portnoy had. I'm not trying to bash Mangini. He's a fantastic drummer. However in the auditions I really enjoyed listening to Minemann (which is why I believe Rudess is doing a solo album with him), Sadly, Mangini didn't deliver to my expectations.\n\nAnd on that note, Dream Theater's self titled album leaves much to be desired. Technically it is great. It ticks all of the boxes. However, I am not quite sure how to say this, but I'll try.. The good riffs were great. You would be sitting there going 'Yes! This is fantastic.' Then BAM a change that lacks a transition into a section that lets a song down. These 'bad' sections linger around for far too long and the 'good' sections end too soon.\n\nThis album has the heaviness of Train of Thought, an album that got many people I know personally into Dream Theater. However, having being a huge fan of DT for all of my life this album lacks the sparkle from previous albums. It hasn't got a character. The album is mediocre and plain. I was even thinking to myself that I must have heard the parts somewhere else before. That was due to nothing being unique. Nothing from this album grabbed me. And that was a huge disappointment. Add really cheesy and rubbish lyrics and you have a good album that has a bad taste. The parts that are good are outweighed by the bad. It is a good album, but not a great one.\n\nWith the negative tone of my review however, I have a couple of positives from this album. Firstly, it is vastly better than 'Black Clouds and Silver Linings' and 'A Dramatic Turn of Events.' They have broken their streak of bad albums. It is the first album with Mangini. Having heard what he can deliver, I am looking forward to their next album with as much anticipation as this one. Lets hope they don't disappoint.\n",
        "\nFor a band that has uncompromisingly stuck to a single sound and style for over two decades, it\u2019s surprising that Dream Theater continue to polarize audiences and spark heated debates. Perhaps it\u2019s an essential part of Prog culture to be opinionated and contrary, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen an album so fiercely contested this year. While some continue to stick to praise of the band\u2019s undeniable technical skill, nostalgic style and relative consistency, others have condemned them for precisely the same reasons. While I would certainly argue that the band over a decade past their prime, Dream Theater haven\u2019t shown any signs of stopping or even slowing down. Even this, their fifteenth and latest record to date has been enjoying exposure and popularity that most self-exclaimed Prog bands wouldn\u2019t dream of having. If it hadn\u2019t been painfully clear already on albums past, \u201cDream Theater\u201d is a sign of a band that have become too comfortable with themselves. With such success and an unquestioningly loyal fanbase, Dream Theater have lost the incentive to innovate and reinvent themselves. Considering they yet retain the legendary musicianship and tightness that first made them famous, it\u2019s really disappointing to hear such a talented band so content to play inside the box. Even so, as familiar and predictable as Dream Theater\u2019s self-titled might be, it\u2019s no doubt a work of some depth and tender care. It won\u2019t go down in history as one of the band\u2019s shining moments, but it should be enough to satisfy the majority of their fanbase, if not convert newcomers to the fold.\n\nDream Theater has fulfilled a pretty major role in my life and musical upbringing, and as such, it\u2019s difficult to write about them without some sort of nostalgia. I was struck with awe when I first heard them over half a lifetime ago, and since then, I\u2019ve followed them eagerly. Although my recent attention\u2019s largely been usurped by newer bands making more interesting music- Haken and Leprous both come to mind- Dream Theater will always hold a special place in my heart. I\u2019m sure Dream Theater themselves would attest to the fact that newer bands have taken progressive metal to greater heights and excesses, but even now, they continue to breathe life into a genre they helped innovate. There are few bands that have been so influential to the birth of a style, and as far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s enough to at least give them a partial pardon for sticking so closely to their original sound. Like \u201cA Dramatic Turn of Events\u201d, \u201cDream Theater\u201d capitalizes on the proggy end of the band\u2019s oeuvre. Although I may have been fooled by the fiercely aggressive single \u201cThe Enemy Inside\u201d, most of the album places a greater emphasis on melodic songwriting and well-rounded arrangements. Fans of their 1992 classic \u201cImages & Words\u201d should rejoice.\nMuch like the two albums that preceded it, Dream Theater\u2019s self-titled sounds like a cross-section of their career. The aforementioned \u201cThe Enemy Inside\u201d has a biting edge and technicality to it that sympathizes most with 2007\u2019s \u201cSystematic Chaos\u201d. \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d has an upbeat vibe to it that recalls \u201cImages & Words\u201d, and the mandatory instrumental \u201cEnigma Machine\u201d is quite a bit like \u201cYtse Jam\u201d from the 1989 debut. Even the band\u2019s weak link \u201cFalling into Infinity\u201d gets a representation here with the cheesy ballad track \u201cAlong for the Ride\u201d. When Dream Theater aren\u2019t revisiting their older incarnations, they take after Rush; \u201cThe Looking Glass\u201d is a stone\u2019s throw from Rush\u2019s \u201cLimelight\u201d, the opening of \u201cSurrender to Reason\u201d is an obvious homage to \u201cXanadu\u201d, and the twenty-two minute epic \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d has plenty of moments that sport the Rush influence proudly. \n\nWhen speaking of the self-titled\u2019s place in the overall scheme of the band\u2019s catalogue, \u201cDream Theater\u201d might be found somewhere between the melodic sensibility of \u201cFalling into Infinity\u201d and proggy throwback of \u201cA Dramatic Turn of Events\u201d. Although Dream Theater remain as flashy and technical as ever, the songwriting places a greater emphasis on melody than what\u2019s been heard from them in recent years. Those who might balk at the prospect of a second \u201cFalling into Infinity\u201d need fear not, however; in the case of \u201cDream Theater\u201d, the melodic focus has come at no cost to the proggy edge or musical complexity. \u201cBehind the Veil\u201d and \u201cSurrender to Reason\u201d each offer some pretty memorable melodies built around tasty progressive arrangements. \u201cSurrender to Reason\u201d in particular has one of the best choruses the band has ever done. Sadly, there are many passages which feel the brunt of James LaBrie\u2019s fading voice, which is really starting to feel the weight of age. I\u2019ve been a longstanding fan of LaBrie for his usually rich and distinctive mid-range, but with some of the more stressful passages he attempts here, even I can begin to see why some people have always singled him out as the band\u2019s weak link. Particularly on \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d, LaBrie tries to convey aggression and range that he may have been able to make sound wonderful in younger days, but it sounds like he\u2019s trying to push himself past his limits. Even so, there are plenty of moments here where his voice sounds as great as ever- \u201cSurrender to Reason\u201d once again makes for an excellent example.\n\nIt comes as absolutely no surprise coming from a band that has built its career around musical virtuosity and stellar performance standards, but Dream Theater can still play circles around other bands. On this time around, John Petrucci earns all special commendations. Although Jordan Rudess still gets some room to solo on the keyboard, all of my favourite moments on \u201cDream Theater\u201d are Petrucci moments. People often take Dream Theater\u2019s technical excellence for granted, but hearing a fresh album reminds me why I was so drawn to this band in the first place. Although Petrucci is most often known for his speed and technical wizardry (both of which are featured on the album), he also delivers some of the most beautiful leads he\u2019s ever recorded here. \u201cThe Bigger Picture\u201d and \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d each have solos that could easily rival the beauty of those featured on \u201cGoodnight Kiss\u201d or \u201cThe Best of Times\u201d. Seriously, even if his work with Dream Theater doesn\u2019t always give room to show it, John Petrucci is one of the best and well-rounded guitarists out there. Petrucci explores a wide variety of rhythms and leads harsh and lush on \u201cDream Theater\u201d, and the excellence of his performance is more than enough to compensate for some of the album\u2019s weaker suits.\n\nSpeaking of weakness, \u201cDream Theater\u201d was meant to be the album where new drummer Mike Mangini (previously of Annihilator) was really meant to prove himself, and his performance is undoubtedly the most disappointing aspect of the album. Seeing Dream Theater with Mangini a couple of years ago, I was able to see him effortlessly recreate Portnoy\u2019s drumwork firsthand. By all accounts, he is a fantastic drummer. It\u2019s that fact that makes his performance here all the more disenchanting. Although Mangini performed the drum parts on \u201cA Dramatic Turn of Events\u201d, he was playing parts written by Portnoy. \u201cDream Theater\u201d was therefore his chance to prove to fans what he had to offer the band\u2019s dynamic. Although his performance is more than functional, it doesn\u2019t impress me nearly as much as I was hoping for. Although it\u2019s possible that Mike Portnoy is rivalled only by Geoff Tate in terms of prog metal douchery, his drum performances had plenty of attitude and identity. Mangini\u2019s drumwork is steady, but never feels particularly inspired or inventive. Whenever he disengages from a steady beat, his fills usually sound the same. Although Mangini certainly has the technical skills worthy of playing with Dream Theater, I\u2019m convinced that there could have been far better choices; for my money, he hasn\u2019t brought the performance here I was hoping for, and frankly expecting.\n\nLyrically speaking, Dream Theater have been dreadfully inconsistent over the course of their career. Although \u201cScenes from a Memory\u201d is possibly the best-written and thoughtful concept album I\u2019ve ever heard, and \u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d had plenty of intelligent lyrical ideas, I wasn\u2019t expecting good lyrics with this album. \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d from 2009\u2019s \u201cBlack Clouds & Silver Linings\u201d had some of the most laughably awful lyrics in prog history- suffice to say, a stories about spooky homoerotic vampires are best left for the bookshelves of impressionable teenage girls. The lyrics on \u201cDream Theater\u201d are filled with the same clich\u00e9s and half-baked philosophy that I would come to expect from a Prog band who didn\u2019t put much consideration into their lyrics. At its worst, it\u2019s as if the basic lyrical content was derived from the jaded conversations of conspiracy theorists and New Age philosophers, and filtered through a Censorship Board of Kindergarten teachers and pregnant Christian mothers.\n\nIn what is something of a longstanding tradition for the band, Dream Theater close the album off with an epic. At twenty-two minutes in length, \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d was the track I was most anxious to finally hear, especially after being so impressed by the album\u2019s first single. Although Dream Theater complete a checklist of many things I may have been looking for in such an ambitious piece, this marks the first time where a DT epic isn\u2019t a highlight on its respective album. Regardless what I may have felt about the band\u2019s stylistic stagnation, I was expecting something major from the last track. Although there are some very engaging ideas on the epic, \u201cIllumination Theory\u201d ultimately fails to come together as a whole. In addition to their solid themes and ingredients, what made past epics like \u201cA Change of Seasons\u201d or \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies\u201d so powerful was their ability to go full circle, to order and arrange their ideas in such a way that it felt like a full-fledged journey within the course of one track. The piece starts off on a good enough note, but by the time LaBrie\u2019s contrived vocals enter the mix, the composition starts losing focus quickly. Even after several listens, no part of the epic really stands out, and the only indicator anywhere during the composition that it is indeed an \u2018epic\u2019 is a section in the middle where the band breaks away from the rock and metal for a period of extended ambiance, like they did with \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d. The grand finale could have been enough to add some life and colour to the piece, but LaBrie\u2019s vocals continue to really irk me here- perhaps he recorded his parts for the epic on a particularly bad day? Especially considering many of the songs on the album are pretty impressive and enjoyable, it\u2019s a real disappointment to see Dream Theater\u2019s skill and tact with epics fall apart so much. There\u2019s always the chance that I\u2019ll feel differently about it a year from now, but I doubt it.\n\nAs was my experience with \u201cA Dramatic Turn of Events\u201d, I\u2019m a little disappointed that \u201cDream Theater\u201d doesn\u2019t have its own identity relative to the band\u2019s existing oeuvre. Unlike \u201cA Dramatic Turn of Events\u201d however, I don\u2019t get the impression that this album is going to be remembered so fondly by fans a decade from now. Then again, it took \u201cSystematic Chaos\u201d over a year to finally hit me; the same may be true for this album. By any standard of mine, Dream Theater have delivered a worthy addition to their catalogue. All of the things listeners have come to love or hate about them are represented here in full. Slick musicianship and bombastic songwriting both have a home here, but the ultimate impression is one of stifling comfort and familiarity. At this point in their career, Dream Theater give the impression of a President who has been in office for thirty years and has grown complacent, no longer feeling the need to prove himself to the voters with particularly inspired policies or edicts. Dream Theater\u2019s self-titled hits all of the marks that a DT album should, but they have left more than enough room for a more determined up-and-comer to approach and knock them off their throne.\n",
        "\nDream Theater proved that they could carry on without drummer and co-founder Mike Portnoy with the excellent A Dramatic Turn of Events. The album featured drum wiz and Berklee instructor Mike Mangini as Portnoy's replacement and while he did a good job, the drumming just lacked the passion and energy they had with Portnoy. That can be chalked up to Mangini having not written the drum arrangements himself, rather only adding his personal touch to programmed beats developed by John Petrucci during the early-writing process. But for the band's upcoming self-titled album, Mangini has been fully unleashed and we're given a small sample through The Enemy Inside. Mike answered the question of what he could bring to the table, but there's a lot I still don't know.\n\nFirst off, Mangini's drumming is absolutely phenomenal. Heavy and almost suffocating but filled with intricate fills and time changes, Mangini has proved he's not the band's silver medal. The song itself is extremely heavy and fast-paced. Petrucci's riffing is in the same vein as Train of Thought, The Dark Eternal Night, and Bridges in the Sky. John Myung's bass compliments and supports the guitar very much the same way as it has on previous heavy efforts. Jordan Rudess' keyboards only take prominence in brief flashes, but they add some very haunting atmosphere to the heavy riffs and give the song a feel much like On the Backs of Angels, only if it were much faster. James LaBrie continues the more relaxed vocal style he displayed on A Dramatic Turn of Events and his solo albums, but lets his voice soar during the chorus. LaBrie has always been smart enough to know how to use his voice and whether it's appropriate to use a hushed semi-whisper, aggressive rasp, or operatic scream. The song keeps a relatively consistent, heavy, and fast-paced sound over the course of six minutes. There are some unnecessary deviations and melody changes at the beginning and bridge, but they lead to a cool keyboard melody and awesome guitar solo, respectively. And again, that is to be expected by a band that focuses so much on instrumentals and breaks. The lyrics and chorus aren't spectacular but definitely aren't too shabby either and are fairly easy to follow. Overall, it sounds like On the Backs of Angels meets Train of Thought.\n\nI am moderately impressed with the band's first single and it definitely has me excited for the album's release. But therein also lies the problem. I want to hear more of the album because I still have no idea what to expect. Dream Theater has always had a habit of making one or two slightly mainstream-accessible songs while taking a more intricate and complex approach with the rest of the album. I have a feeling that The Enemy Inside might be their \"commercial song\" much like Build Me Up Break Me Down and Forsaken were, but it still leaves me confused as to whether or not this a hint at the direction the band is going in. It leaves me a bit anxious, considering that even though the song is fairly good it's not as impressive as what I have usually come to expect from the band (even though they have their fair share of unimpressive songs). But then again I guess that means the band is doing its job in making the fan anticipate the album's release even more. Even though The Enemy Inside is a bit too straightforward, it definitely has a lot going for it and is yet another fine example of the musicianship and skill we should expect from Dream Theater.\n",
        "\nFollow up to Dream Theater's grandiose Octavarium is their ninth studio album Systematic Chaos. Released in 2007, this record comes across as the most beastly form of progressive metal ever heard. For me it was the album opener \"In the Presence of Enemies - Part I\" that made me go and buy the record straight away. A complete run of the whole record was absolute bliss and full of surprises and left me in disbelief for most of the time. \n\nThe record has billions of notes shooting through every track in the form of really long, epic compositions. The more runs done on the record, better is the understanding of the bands achievement in this mammoth musical release. There some moments for breathing in the form of the inspirational 'Prophets of War' and the instantly likable 'Forsaken' and it felt as good as 'Pull Me Under' for me. Dream Theater's music has always been different from other metal or other progressive metal bands in terms of their overall sound. But this record has some of the most crushingly heavy sounding parts reminiscent of Pantera's The Great Southern Trendkill. It's is an absolute surprise and pleasure to hear John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy deliver some ultra-aggressive moments. \n\nThere are tracks that a have simple conventional song writing approach as well as some very complex arrangements which also make this one of Dream Theater's most balanced releases despite being unpredictable at the same time. The interplay of distorted vocals by both LaBrie and Portnoy with some clean singing, is something that's never been heard before and sounds apt for the record. But again it's the vocals that might not be accepted by fans that are used LaBrie's ways of conventional singing. Jordan Rudess's keyboards in this record are a perfect mix of fun and dexterity and it\u2019s his playing that makes this Dream Theater's most experimental record. John Myung's virtuoso bass playing gives density and ample weight making the music sound ever so uncompromising. It's however Myung's bass that I would have loved to hear off the beat, rather than galloping along Petrucci's and Portnoy\u2019s instrumental lines.\n\nTo round up, Systematic Chaos is a must have for enthusiasts of progressive music. The record has plenty of instrumental wizardry and melodic passages which will easily have a lasting appeal on anyone who can appreciate Jazz and Classical. This record makes me mighty proud of their music and it is easily Dream Theater's unstoppable victorious march towards composing music!\n",
        "\nDream Theater has always been a band that has been able to continue running smoothly in the event of band member switches. The first album that featured vocalist James LaBrie was the smash hit Images and Words, former keyboardist Derek Sherinian\u2019s debut was on the successful A Change of Seasons EP, and current keyboardist Jordan Rudess came on for the highly acclaimed concept album Scenes From A Memory. While the well-publicized departure of founding drummer Mike Portnoy has led to a lot of speculation and mixed emotions, the band\u2019s first album with former Extreme/Annihilator drummer Mike Mangini is no exception to the old rule. While the band was never exactly at a point of stagnation in this reviewer\u2019s opinion, this album does breathe new life into their sound and predicts a nice change of direction.\n\nThere are some traits from Dream Theater\u2019s last couple albums that are still in place on here, but this album does inevitably have a very different feel that hasn\u2019t been observed in quite some time. Some people have found parallels between this album and the sound on Images and Words and a few have accused the band of recycling the structures of past songs for here, but the similarities are rather superficial as the album\u2019s production and technical displays are clearly cemented in the present day.\n\nAnd some may call blasphemy, but this album really seems to have a few things in common with Falling Into Infinity and is easily their most melodic release since Octavarium came out in 2005. Of course, it isn\u2019t quite as commercially minded as there are an unusual number of longer songs and heavier moments. But if anything, you could say that this is the first album since Scenes From A Memory where Dream Theater actually feels entirely comfortable with being Dream Theater. There are no attempts to write songs in the styles of Muse or Opeth and there aren\u2019t any members that feel out of place.\n\nSpeaking of members, not too much has really been changed as the musicians still continue to show off a good deal of chemistry and technical prowess. Mangini does put on an expectedly great performance but one does wonder how things would be if his part hadn\u2019t been programmed for him. You might want to listen to LaBrie\u2019s first three solo releases if you want to hear what the guy is really capable of\u2026\n\nWith all the changes that have taken place, the songwriting isn\u2019t too far off from Black Clouds & Silver Linings as most of the tracks range from being eight to twelve minutes long. If anything, the only thing that\u2019s changed is the addition of a few extra ballads to make up for the absence of the twenty-five minute long monsters that have been so popular with them lately. Predictably, the longer tracks manage to be the biggest highlights as they manage to put in some memorable hooks while showing off the standard soloing and complex structures. The opening \u201cOn The Backs of Angels\u201d starts things off on a particularly dramatic note with some strong transitions while \u201cLost Not Forgotten\u201d is noteworthy for its crunchy verse riff and pounding chorus.\n\nEven if the band will never release something as tragic as \u201cSpace Dye Vest,\u201d the ballads on here are nicely composed and all conjure memories of past tracks. While \u201cThis Is The Life\u201d has a rather greeting card feel that reminds one of \u201cThe Answer Lies Within,\u201d \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d is a short piano driven number in the vein of \u201cVacant\u201d and the largely acoustic \u201cBeneath the Surface\u201d feels like a more complete version of \u201cThe Silent Man.\u201d\n\nAnd just as the previous album had \u201cA Rite of Passage,\u201d this release does have an almost commercial oddball in the form of \u201cBuild Me Up, Break Me Down.\u201d While the song\u2019s electronic feel and borderline nu metal leanings may give some listeners a rather Disturbed vibe, it\u2019s a pretty decent track with a catchy chorus that\u2019s hard to get out of your head. If anything, it\u2019s kind of like \u201cYou Not Me\u201d with a lot less suck\u2026\n\nAs a person who still loves Dream Theater\u2019s last few albums, I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you that this is the band\u2019s greatest effort since Images and Words or Scenes From A Memory. However, I will tell you that it is a really strong release that proves they\u2019re capable of running a smooth ship in the absence of Portnoy. It\u2019s certainly not at the high point that was achieved on those two efforts or the monolithic Awake, but it does make one excited for what the band will be following this up with in the future. Think there\u2019s a chance of Mangini having a four-album suite up his sleeve?\n\nCurrent Highlights:\n\u201cOn The Backs of Angels\u201d\n\u201cLost Not Forgotten\u201d\n\u201cBridges In The Sky\u201d\n\u201cFar From Heaven\u201d\n\u201cBeneath the Surface\"\n",
        "\nWith the commercially-failed yet somewhat underrated Falling Into Infinity in 1997 (a more traditional metal album to some extent), Dream Theater was done with trying to please record executives and decided to go back to the old swing of things with complete creative control and self-produced albums from then on. Though Metropolis Pt. 1 from Images and Words was never meant to have a sequel (the part 1 was meant to be a joke) fan requests led to the development of a massive epic sequel over twenty minutes long but was refused by execs to appear on Falling Into Infinity, and the only recording is an instrumental demo on the Falling Into Infinity official bootleg. Nevertheless, with the band firmly in charge once again of their writing and music, the gang decided it was high time to produce a rightful sequel to the acclaimed Metropolis Pt. 1 in the form of an entire album, and the end result is a very satisfying and ambitious venture.\n\nInstrumentation and soloing are Dream Theater's claim to fame, and there's absolutely no shortage of them on Scenes from a Memory, especially with two instrumentals. Now, this particular feature has always polarized listeners, especially on this album. Loyalists have long applauded the creative and masterful musicianship on this album while critics have attacked it as \"wanking\" and \"musical masturbation\", which are quite frankly two phrases I'm sick of reading in reviews. I'll admit there's such a thing as too much, but oftentimes it's just criticism for the sake of criticism. If the solos were repetitive and unoriginal then yes, there is reason to complain. But Dream Theater has always found a way to keep things fresh and exciting, and that is very prevalent on Scenes from a Memory. The most important factor to note about instrumentation is keyboardist Jordan Rudess, who made his debut on this album. While later albums have featured Rudess mostly in the solos rather than in the melodies like previous keyboardists Kevin Moore and Derek Sherinian, Rudess is at his most versatile with shred solos, melodic verses, and even some flashes of jazz piano to fit the theme of the 1920's. Mike Portnoy also gives out some of his finest drum work and is perhaps most prominently featured on this album with heavy fills, constant snares, and frequent time changes (cough, Dance of Eternity, cough cough). Bassist John Myung pulls out a mind-blowing solo in that very song as well, and John Petrucci's guitarwork is not only spectacular but complements Jordan's soloing well. James LaBrie's singing is also quite good, and even though his voice did not fully recover from his vocal chord injury until Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, he's more than capable of hitting the high notes, especially with his backing vocal recording in Strange Deja Vu.\n\nIn order to continue the story of Metropolis, the band had to tweak and alter the story as Metropolis 1, with no sequel intended, is supposedly about the mythological founders of Rome: Romulus and Remus. Nevertheless, the alterations to the story fit into Metropolis Pt. 1 and several musical and lyrical references to the first song appear frequently in the album. The story is about a man named Nicholas who undergoes sessions of hypnotherapy in order to find out why he is having dreams about his past life Victoria, a girl in the 1920's who was involved in a love triangle with two brothers (the Miracle and the Sleeper) and was mysteriously murdered, as well as get to the bottom of his fears of death and the afterlife. It is overall a very well-written story with constant flashbacks, songs taking place in both the past and present, and a shocking twist ending. The band does a nice job in telling the story by occasionally alternating instrumental songs and with lyrics that are overall clear and easy to follow, something the band had a bit of trouble with in their early career. However, sometimes the straightforward lyrics are too straightforward and can occasionally come off as simple and uncreative, mainly on Beyond This Life. The song almost word for word describes the scene of Victoria's murder with LaBrie at one point screaming the lyrics rapidly, coming off as kind of silly. But overall, Dream Theater proves that they know how to tell a good story.\n\nTo fit the theme of the story, the songs flow almost seamlessly together; sounding like one continuous song. Though a 'prog metal\" album, Scenes from a Memory definitely has its softer moments as well, often in interludes. And it is with softer songs that the album falters a bit. Ballads are always difficult to pull off because oftentimes their soft nature come off as a bit boring and can make one impatient for the next song to start, hoping for something more energetic and powerful. But while in terms of casual listening they may be less exciting, in terms of storytelling they do a perfect job of capturing character and emotion, whether its sorrow and fear (Through Her Eyes) or acceptance and peace (The Spirit Carries On, which also happens to feature one of Petrucci's finest guitar solos). But even when it comes to story-line and emotion, some tracks are clearly better than others. Two of the real gems are the instrumentals Overture: 1928 and The Dance of Eternity. Both are plentiful in crazy solos with the latter featuring the band's best overall musicianship together since Metropolis 1. But perhaps the best song is the epic Home. The heaviest song on the album, it features a very cool Middle-Eastern feel with sitar sound effects and despite being over twelve minutes, does not drag on at all. While those three stand above the rest, the album is backed by other solid songs such as Strange Deja Vu, Fatal Tragedy, and Finally Free, the closing song. The End of Scenes from a Memory would mark the band's trend of ending an album the same way the next album starts, which would go from continuing the end of Finally Free to Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence opener The Glass Prison and finally ending on Octavarium. Dream Theater knows how to think ahead, huh?\n\nWhile Scenes from a Memory might not have the same kind of entertainment consistency as other concept albums such as Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime, it still earns a spot as one of the greatest concept albums of all time. Dream Theater, as always, brings everything to the table and settles for nothing less than excellent. While maybe not the best Dream Theater album for casual listening just songs at a time (then again, is Dream Theater ever \"casual\" listening\"?) listening to the album as a whole allows the listener to have a greater appreciation of the story and emotion, which is what the band was trying to accomplish here. And throwing in some awesome solos never hurts either.\n",
        "\nHas anyone here, like me, ever liked a band a whole lot in the past and over time acquired a lot of the CDs in their discography, listened to them really enthusiastically at first but gradually less and less choosing other music over them almost not wanting yet still somehow thinking they're better than certain other bands until finally you stop listening to them altogether and your CDs just sit on a shelf collecting dust? Then, you come across them again a while later, give them a refreshing listening, and say to yourself \"Wait a second! I don't like this!\" That is exactly my experience with Dream Theater, and Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory was the first album by them that I acquired. As it turns out, I think it's their worst.\n\nAll the alarms that went off that started to get me think this album isn't as good as I thought it was all went off one at a time over time. I believe the earliest was for the lyrical themes; and to be frank, the story this album follows fucking sucks. Some dude undergoes hypnotherapy for reasons that never are really explained. All I can gather is that he's wondering what his own life is about, which I don't believe should warrant the hiring of a hypnotherapist. Just realize that life has no meaning and nobody is going to miss us when we're all dead; a philosophy like that makes for a happy life. But, he goes through with this anyway and he experiences a past life as a woman who's stuck in a love triangle dilemma with two assholes who happen to be brothers. This story goes nowhere interesting and only ends with two of the three characters dead; a happy ending would have all of them dead, probably from suicide from realize that they're living inside a soap opera. I also don't understand why the dude in the present just had to go back to relive a stupid drama like this. Surely if he had traveled back further in his reincarnation history, he would have come across a Spartan, pirate, viking, or even a prostitute. If this soap opera is the most exciting past life he could get, his other lives must have been filled with Arabian carpet merchants, Irish sheep herders, and Indian garbage men.\n\nAlarm number two came from James LaBrie. I really cannot stand the guy's voice; he sounds like a woman even when he's not trying to be the voice of the woman character in which case such as in the first \"Tonight I've been searching for it\" part in \"Strange Deja Vu\" in which he sounds really, really bad. But you know what? LaBrie's voice goes pretty well with the cheesy shitty lyrics, and these two together go well with the crappy music on this album. Crap goes really well with crap and crap, and this leads me to the third alarm that went off which took longer to be heard than before, but after a while I finally realized how poor the music is. Regression is a useless intro that plays into another intro track, \"Overture 1928\", which contains music that sounds like it was stolen from the opening theme of a show on Home and Garden Television. It's this soft, shitty rock garbage that plays into the first song with lyrics \"Strange Deja Vu\". From there, the band makes a couple of attempts at a darker sound with two lame results: \"Fatal Tragedy\" and the horribly bloated, chug laced \"Home\". \"Through Her Eyes\", \"One Last Time\", \"Through My Words\", and \"The Spirit Carries On\" are the worst of the worst here where the album is at its softest and most flowery.\n\nAnd you know what? I feel bad for John Petrucci. The guy can obviously play a couple of good solos. The catch is that they're surrounded by this HGTV themed nonsense so he'd might as well be the guitarist from Men Without Hats. This feeling is not mutual for Mike Portnoy. I have no idea why this blue-goateed twelve stepper is praised so much when there is so little about his drumming performance that is at all special. Nothing he does here stands out.\n\nAfter a bloated soft rock piece and some sounds of the modern guy walking into his home, you hear this \"WAKE UP!\" announcement, convenient for those of you who fell asleep listening to this album.\n\nNow, it would be a bit of a far shot, but I believe that this train wreck could have been avoided if they made some of the following improvements during production. First, the lyrics would have to be completely rewritten. This precursor to Twilight is a lost cause, might as well scrap the whole story and begin anew. I'm sure if Dream Theater still wanted to make an album about a guy going back to a past life, they could write up a story about one of his ancestors discovering an elaborate plot concocted by the Knights Templar to take over everyone's minds, so he assassinates key members of this order to deconstruct their plans. You know, a story that actually had meaning instead of something that only spineless support group wankers can appreciate. This would be a key change in the album's turn out considering they'd definitely make the music more interesting instead of matching up with a shitty story. Second, James LaBrie would need to be dumped from the line-up. Bring in Russel Allen or someone else who actually sounds like his gender; I just say Russel Allen because he's had a history of singing about epic tales. Third, you bring in a second guitarist to play rhythm guitar. With the added depth of sound, maybe they can ditch a lot of this soft rock sound and actually write a few interesting riffs. It couldn't be Michael Romeo or anyone else who would greatly overshadow John Petrucci though. Wouldn't want to demoralize him even further. These changes would help pave the way to a more acceptable album.\n\nAs it stands now though, Scenes From a Memory is a boring album that should be avoided. This is an album that I used to really like, so you can't say that I didn't try to like this. But that just goes to show how pathetic I was in early high school before growing up and getting myself a booster shot of pride and self-esteem. Now, this album doesn't mean anything to me but bad music that is unfortunately considered to be good by a large number of people.\n",
        "\nI first heard of Dream Theater from a music student at college. The band's fan base is composed less of metalheads and more of music students and guitar nerds. There's no mystery why that's the case: The band's musicians--who met at Berklee College of Music--are consistently named to be among some of the best in rock music. \n\nSo music geeks love them. But Metalheads, as a rule, hate them. Online discussions can be pretty contentious, given the extreme reactions they've inspired. Today is the 20th anniversary of the band's best-known album, Images and Words (March 28, 1992, per some sources, although other sources place it on July 7). I thought it would be a good time to examine the record's merits with as little bias as I can.\n\nI&W begins on the excellent \"Pull Me Under,\" still the band's most successful song. It's fairly heavy considering how commercial it is, and the chorus is pure gold. Examine this song closely, and you'll have the band's formula, a formula they still follow today. The music combines Fates Warning style prog metal with glam metal. They drop the shtick of glam, but sadly they don't manage to avoid the cheese factor. But it's that commercial, glam metal influence that makes the music accessible. Without the hooks, no one would give a damn about Dream Theater, regardless of how good the riffs and solos may be.\n\nThey follow \"Pull Me Under\" with a ballad. \"Another Day\" features saxophone more befitting of a Kenny G smooth jazz record than something in the \"metal\" bin. This one brings a major criticism of the band to the forefront: James LaBrie's vocals. If you heard this guy at a karaoke contest, you would think, \"Damn, he's pretty good.\" Heard in the context of a record, it's a different story. His clean vocal delivery unsuccessfully reaches for the highs, and lacks any kind of soul. Ironically, this only weak point in the talent deparment is also the main reason they've been more commercially successful than other prog metal bands. Since he's not that great, you feel like you can sing along. He's a blessing and a curse.\n\nThey quickly redeem themselves after the ill-advised ballad. \"Take the Time\" is another fantastic song with some heavy riffs, flashy solos, and an incredibly catchy chorus. But, after that, they seem bent on destroying themselves with second ballad \"Surrounded.\" Besides the vocal issue, it brings to light another major issue with the band. The keyboard parts have not aged well. \"Surrounded\" has the worst of the synth problems, but they pop up in a lot of other places as well.\n\nThe second half of the record sums up the remainder of the highs and lows of Dream Theater's music. Like much prog, it devolves into wankery, with long, meandering songs and another ballad (which is thankfully not as bad as the other two). There are cool riffs and cool solos (check \"Under a Glass Moon\" for the best of both), but no great songwriting and no great hooks.\n\nImages and Words sums up the best and the worst of Dream Theater. They've got a couple of great songs with awesome riffs, showy solos, and huge hooks that beg you to sing along. But they've also got crappy, fondue-dipped ballads and heavy doses of prog wankery. \n\nThe Verdict: Both the anti- and pro-Dream Theater camps have seriously overstated the case. Dream Theater have some very good songs. They also have some really shitty songs, and others that probably sounded better twenty years ago but have lost their freshness. They belong more to the Guitar World than to the world of Decibel and Terrorizer, but in the end, every metalhead should own at least one of their albums. But that one album should be Train of Thought, not Images and Words.\n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nSince the unfortunate schism between DT and founding member Mike Portnoy, both sides have successfully moved on from the drama. But who really came out on top? Portnoy formed Adrenaline Mob; a band that sounds like NWOAHM but with actual talent behind it, and Flying Colors, whose debut album is one of the best things ever recorded. What has DT done? This big morass of prog metal filled with more of the same they've been doing since Train of Thought. Considering his recent output, it's no surprise Portnoy wanted a break from...well...this.\n\nOn a positive note, the musicianship is still there; DT - Portnoy + Mangini still equals a fairly impressive fivesome of metal talent, and the album taken as a whole, is still perfectly solid in all aspects. And, well, the lyrics are fine. There's really nothing actually bad about this album...but that's all the praise I can really muster.\n\nThe biggest problem I'm getting is that none of it is all that memorable. It just sorta blends into all the other music they've done in the past ten years, excluding Octavarium, which was awesome. It doesn't even feel like there's a cohesive theme here; just the same formula of instrument noodling-to-vocals-to-noodling for an hour and change. It's a strange conundrum where I know the music is honestly good but it utterly fails to keep my interest. It's a good album for throwing into your playlist on a long drive or plane ride, but its overwhelming blandness sinks in quick if you really sit down to listen to it. Sure it's heavy, but there's just no legitimate 'edge' to it. On a technical level, it easily passes. On an artistic/metal/prog level, it falls pretty flat.\n\nAll in all, it feels like an album fueled by spite. It's good, but spite is a fuel that burns quick. Only time will really tell if DT is better off without Portnoy. That question doesn't seem to matter much though, since it's pretty obvious that Portnoy's better off without them.\n\nP.S. - It's pretty weak and classless of the band to name this album what it is and deny it has anything to do with their former drummer. I don't believe them for a second.\n",
        "\nIf one band has through some major changes recently, it would have to be Dream Theater. Mike Portnoy, the band\u2019s original drummer, left not too long ago to join Avenged Sevenfold and ended up leaving them for Adrenaline Mob. He wasn\u2019t allowed to come back to Dream Theater because in his departure, they already found another drummer by the name of Mike Mangini. I feel that the publicized search for a new drummer (including a DVD of this) was way over the top for a band that\u2019s been around for 25+ years.\n\nNonetheless, Mangini holds his own on Dream Theater\u2019s brand new album A Dramatic Turn Of Events (I suspect the title reflects their situation as well). The album opens up with Sarod-like guitar and a bass and orchestra-heavy bridge, goes into an asian-esque keyboard rhythm that seems ideal for an excellent light show, and sultry vocals coupled with awesome guitar solos to bring the listener deeper into the album.\n\nEver wondered what Dream Theater would sound like if they put a little nu-metal influence into their music? That question is answered with \u201cBuild Me Up, Break Me Down.\u201d The beginning sounds like something that wouldn\u2019t be too out of place on a Disturbed song, most evident in the bass playing and the pounding drums. On the chorus, vocalist James LaBrie could have sung out more, as I know he has the ability to do so. It\u2019s a little too soft and unless you mess with your equalizer (like I did) it lies underneath the instruments too much.\n\nIf \u201cThis Is the Life\u201d doesn\u2019t become a staple in their live set, then I\u2019m a monkey\u2019s uncle. With soaring guitars that sound like the end of an action movie, the song heads into a really soft, piano-driven vocal ear grabber that invokes the imagination to decipher it all as a story. At the 1:50 mark we see the guitar and keyboard trading off, which really sets the mood. This is the kind of song that you turn on your iTunes (or Xbox) audio visual effects and kick back to.\n\nGuitars take center stage in the beginning of \u201cOutcry.\u201d Lots of epic and heavy riffs fill the song to make any guitar geek happy. This song gives equal opportunity for all members of the band to showcase their playing. The keys have a few solo moments in the song that the drums play off of, then the guitar solos really show the listener how guitars should be played.\n\nThe mixing of this album really gave more of an emphasis on the bass and the drums over the other instruments and vocals, but it\u2019s not too much of a difference. This album definitely had its awesome moments, especially in the guitar riffs and solos, but for the spastic listener like me, 10+ minute songs are too much. It really takes someone with lots of free time to get into this album. This is definitely one of the top progressive metal albums of the year, as few other bands can do it as good as Dream Theater can.\n",
        "\nAfter the much-acclaimed 1999 album Metropolis II: Scenes from a Memory, Dream Theater's next four albums would be an interesting forray of experimentation that polarized and heavily divided fans. And signing with record label Roadrunner didn't help either, as many hardcore fans accused the progressive metal outfit of \"selling out.\" And while I found those criticisms somewhat unwarranted and unfair, with the exception of Train of Thought, albums such as Systematic Chaos, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, and Octavarium had their hit-and-miss moments. Those problems are, for the most part, not the case for Black Clouds and Silver Linings, as it proves to be one of their most solid lineup of songs with certain tracks deserving of classic status.\n\nDespite the album having only a surprising six songs, this still remains one of Dream Theater's longest albums, as four out of the six tracks run well past the ten minute-mark. A six-song album certainly has its advantages, as the band clearly took its time and put in a lot of effort on each track. This is not surprising as the title captures the unifying theme of the album: five out of the six songs deal with deeply emotional and at times, traumatic experiences from the bandmembers' (only John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy, mind you) lives. With this in mind, the band is at some of their most emotional and often times in storytelling-mode. And it is in telling stories and capturing their emotions is why the band is at its strongest in this album. Not to mention the instrumentation and frequent solos are as fantastic as usual and James LaBrie's singing is still powerful, melodic, and emotional.\n\nA Nightmare to Remember starts off the album and the Black Clouds half of the album, which is an over-sixteen minute story of a childhood car accident John Petrucci and his family were in. It's this track that the band shows off it's ability to tell a story using its progressive stylings, transitioning melodies and sound from soft and heavy to capture every moment of the story, whether it's the eerie keyboard build-up with rain sound effects in the intro, the aggressive riffs leading up to the accident, and the somber melodies of Petrucci in the hospital. The song is truly a roller coaster transitioning from fast and heavy to slow and melancholic, with Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess trading solos. The use of Portnoy delivering an aggressive verse in the bridge may cause some to raise their eyebrows and the song drags on a bit near the end (it is over sixteen minutes after all) it remains a very strong opening and a sign of what's to come later. The next song is the only non-personal track on the album: A Rite of Passage, which is about the free masons. Although eight and-a-half minutes long, the song is a play to the band's more commercial side, with a catchy and memorable chorus and riff. The intro features awesome bass distortion by John Myung and has Middle Eastern sounds and elements before breaking off into a drastically different-sounding guitar and keyboard solo which features interesting use of an iPhone. While the solos don't flow into the song as well as other Dream Theater songs and come a bit out of nowhere, A Rite of Passage remains one of the best tracks on the album for its sheer catchiness and memorability. Wither falls into a similar category, having the sound of an alternative rock-power ballad-arena anthem with an almost Staind-sounding acoustic guitar intro. It's also short, sweet, and to the point at only five and-a-half minutes (the shortest on the album) and details John Petrucci's diffculties in songwriting. Like a Rite of Passage, Wither is one of the album's best with its catchiness and accessibility.\n\nThe Silver Linings half of the album begins with the final song in Mike Portnoy's Twelve-Step Suite about his overcoming alcoholism: The Shattered Fortress. It is unfortuntately here that the album largely falls short of perfection. Although featuring several reprisals of the previous songs of the suite, which are a high point, the song suffers from somewhat overly-simplistic lyrics that don't fit with the aggressive riffs in the opening verse, which is disappointing given the cool build-up at the beginning. LaBrie's vocals in the opening stanzas are also distorted similarly to The Glass Prison and come off as awkward-sounding, as well as the deeply distorted vocals used during the bridge. The reprisals of the other step songs are nice and salvage the song somewhat, but ultimately The Shattered Fortress fails to be the satisfying conclusion it could have been. Luckily, this is the only misfire on the album, as things pick up with The Best of Times. Over thirteen minutes long, it is the touching story of Mike Portnoy saying good-bye to his father, who died of cancer shortly after the song's conception, and remembering the times they spent together. After an extended and melancholic intro featuring both acousitc guitar and the violin, it builds up almost immeditately into a fast, upbeat sound more reminiscent of progressive rock and containing a Rush-like feel. The song eventually transitions once again to a slow and somber sound, before ending with an extended, triumphant-sounding guitar solo by Petrucci. The album closes with the nineteen-minute epic The Count of Tuscany. Giving the album a strong close, it is easily the best track on the album and even outshines past epics such as A Change of Seasons, Octavarium, and In the Presence of Enemies. It tells the story of John Petrucci's meeting of the aforementioned count and his brother at their estate during the Train of Thought tour and how their eccentric lives caused him to fear for his life. The band's storytelling is at its finest here, transitioning from an extended melodic and upbeat instrumental section to a dark and foreboding fast-paced riff. LaBrie begins to tell the story with clear and descriptive lyrics, painting the perfect picture for the listener and delivers one of the album's catchiest choruses. The song breaks down into a melancholic riff before transitioning to an extended, near-silent, ambient bridge featuring only magical guitar wails by Petrucci. After a few minutes, the song transitions to an acoustic guitar and LaBrie returns before the song explodes into its final segment with a reprisal of the intro, finally ending with the sounds of nature and wildlife. All in all, The Count of Tuscany is easily one of Dream Theater's best and gives the album an extremely satisfying conclusion.\n\nBlack Clouds and Silver Linings falls short of perfection with the disappointing aspects of The Shattered Fortress and much of John Myung's uniqe bass is used to support the guitar. However, every other aspect of the album shines and is an excellent example of progressive, storytelling music. An essential release by a spectacular band.\n",
        "\nLet's face it, Dream Theater has always been a metal band, but with such a heavy emphasis on progressive elements such as melody changes, unconventional song structures going beyond the verse-chorus-verse-chorus formula, and their extended and intricate instrumental sections and solos, the heavy riffing and drumming has just always served as a building block and base to build their sound on. And yet they've been known to go heavy on songs such as Lie, The Mirror, Caught in a Web, Home, and The Glass Prison on their previous albums and positive fan reaction at concerts to these songs inspired the undertaking known as Train of Thought. It is this album that Dream Theater reminds us that they are technically a metal band, but, much like later releases such as Octavarium, it has forever polarized and divided their fanbase. Some applauded the new direction while others complained of the band going \"commercial.\" But really, with the exception of cranking up the heaviness and intensity, all of the progressive elements that made Dream Theater what they are are still present, making this one of the best they've ever released.\n\nOpening track As I Am picks up right where Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence left off, beginning with the same symphonic keyboard note that Losing Time/Grand Finale ended on. But then a low and foreboding guitar chord is heard, and you know things are about to get heavy. As I Am really helps set the stage for what this album will be. Although there aren't really any melody changes, the skillful instrumentation is in no ways lost and John Petrucci delivers a solo that will make shred fans cheer. The lyrics are somewhat simpler and more straightforward for this song, as well as the rest of the album, than the band has been known for, but often times it really helps get the point across rather than trying to over-rely on metaphors and symbolism, something the band had struggled with in the past. The theme of the album is truly what the title implies, as most of the songs flow almost seamlessly into each other. Right as As I Am ends, This Dying Soul (the second part of the Twelve-Step Suite) begins. Easily the heaviest, fastest, and most intense song on the album, the track features frantic double-bass drumming by Portnoy and heavily riff layering from Petrucci and John Myung giving it a deep and booming feel. But there is no lack of progression, as the song is chock full of melody and time changes, solos, and even a reprisal of the Glass Prison. LaBrie also exhibits his range, interchanging soaring and melodic vocals with distorted quasi-rapping. Like the transition from the previous song, This Dying Soul goes right into Endless Sacrifice, which features a nice soft/loud dynamic in the verses and chorus and features an extended solo section in the middle with some of Jordan Rudess' finest keyboard work. It's elements like these as well as in This Dying Soul that show the band can keep some familiarity with their instrumentation and solos while experimenting with heavier sounds.\n\nStarting with a mind-blowing drum fill by Portnoy, Honor Thy Father is perhaps the most controversial song on the album. Many fans have long complained that LaBrie's rapped-like aggressive vocals in the verses make the song (gasp!) \"mallcore\" or \"nu metal.\" With the exception of LaBrie's vocal delivery as well as more simplistic lyrics (the song is basically an \"I hate you\" to Mike Portnoy's step-father) Honor Thy Father continues the trend of this album: traditional Dream Theater progression with heavier riffs and faster drumming. The song also features a soundbyte montage, an occasional Dream Theater characteristic not heard since Space-Dye Vest on Awake. The heaviness comes to a screeching halt in the next song though, Vacant. Clocking in at under three minutes, it is a melancholic symphonic and orchestral-sounding ballad about James LaBrie's daughter who fell into a brief coma from suffering a seizure. Similar to Wait for Sleep serving as interlude to Learning to Live on Images and Words, Vacant seemingly serves as an interlude to the instrumental Stream of Consciousness. Dream Theater has been known for their knack for instrumentals, but Stream of Consciousness is in all likelihood their best effort, even beating out favorites such as Overture: 1928 and the much-revered The Dance of Eternity. Featuring a fairly consistent mid-paced melody, the song also features numerous masterful guitar and keyboard solos (being the longest instrumental there's time for plenty) and MIke Portnoy's constant time changes and drum fills has led Stream of Consciousness to be considered as his crowning performance. The final track is In the Name of God, an over-fourteen minute epic. The band goes all out with a heavy-yet somber sound in a song denouncing Muslim extremists that picks up in emotion and desperation to the very end, which features a nice background rendition of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", ending with a low piano note that begins the opening track on the next album, Octavarium.\n\nTrain of Thought will probably never be as universally accepted as albums such as Images and Words, Awake, or Scenes from a Memory, but without a doubt this album is one of Dream Theater's most stacked and consistent efforts. James LaBrie still impresses with soaring melodic vocals interchanged with aggressive rasps, John Petrucci is still capable of a masterful shred solo, John Myung's basslines increase the intensity of the riffs, and Mike Portnoy switches off double bass pedalling with crazy fills. While some will continue to complain about the album's emphasis on a heavier metal sound, none of the instrumentation, melody, or emotion you would expect from a Dream Theater album is lost. Rather, everything is still there and that normal base metal sound is just turned up a few notches.\n",
        "\nThis is a rewritten review.\n\nAfter first hearing Panic Attack from Rock Band 2, I became introduced to Dream Theater and later acquired their second album Images and Words and was immediately blown away by their mix of metal, progressive rock, and jam band-like instrumentation. I slowly but surely acquired every other album by the band (becoming a massive Dream Theater fan), and Awake was one of the last I obtained. While most critics and first time listeners often hold the consensus that Images and Words was the band's best effort (yours truly included) several hardcore fans consider this to be the band's magnum opus that was at first lost and underappreciated amidst the rise of grunge music upon its release. Recent reviews have been kinder to this album and almost every fan considers Awake to be at least one of the top three releases by the band. Upon listening to this album for the first time, I realized its potential to be their best but felt that it lacked top-to-bottom consistent quality. However after further listens, Awake still stacks up to be one of Dream Theater's best, even if some songs are better than others.\n\nAfter the magical and dream-like Images and Words, the band was pressured to try and put out a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Therefore, Awake has in some aspects more of a straightforward hard rock/heavy metal feel, but still retains several elements of progressive time changes, instrumentation, and emotional lyrics. The album starts off very strong with the first three tracks 6:00, Caught in a Web, and Innoncence Faded, which definitely show off the album's more rock/metal tendencies. 6:00 features an excellent drumfill opening and snapping snare, which is a consistent drum technique used by Mike Portnoy throughout the rest of the album, resulting in Awake to be considered one of Portnoy's best. Caught in a Web has a heavier and more grinding guitar that is also more fast-paced and slighty more intense than 6:00, but also contains an extremely catchy chorus. Innocence Faded has a very upbeat melody and features one of James LaBrie's finest vocal performances, hitting an F5 similar to that of Learning to Live. Awake as a whole shows off LaBrie's range, often using an aggressive rasp while occasionally going softer and melodic to soaring at the top of his lungs. All in all, the first three songs succeed as being very catchy and memorable and displaying the band's move to a heavier sound. The next three songs form the Mind Beside Itself Suite and are all connected together. It is unfortunately here that the album starts to lag a tad bit. It starts off with the instrumental Erotomania. While it retains the upbeat rock sound present in the three previous songs and features excellent instrumenation (especially a particular drum fill by Portnoy) it just doesn't measure up the same way to later instrumentals the band has been known for, such as Overture: 1928, The Dance of Eternity, or Stream of Consciousness. However, Erotomania is still quite an impressive example of musicianship. The next part of the suite is Voices, which is the first nine minute-plus song on the album. Voices has intersting lyrics about mental illnesses and diseases with interesting instrumentation and a heavy feel. However, upon listening to it the first time I felt it drawn-out and not that interesting despite the instrumentation. But Voices eventually grows on you and the chorus becomes more and more catchy with every listen. It is ultimately a track that can be appreciated for being forward without too much grandeur. The next song is The Silent Man, which is a particularly unique track being an entirely accoustic power ballad. While certainly different from what the band had done before, it unfortunately fell victim to the same fate as Voices the first time around: just not that interesting. But with continued and further listens, The Silent Man grows on you and can be better appreciated for its emotion captured in such simplicity. Though A Mind Beside Itself falters in some areas and doesn't continue the strong beginning of the first three tracks, they are by no means \"bad\" songs and become more entertaining if given time and patience.\n\nThings pick up a tad with The Mirror, a sort of precursor to the Twelve-Step Suite about Mike Portnoy's alcoholism. One of the heaviest and most grinding songs on the album, it also features some interesting organ-sounding keyboards and a strong mix of high and aggressive vocals by James LaBrie. While still not quite as good as the opening songs, The Mirror definitely does keep the ball rolling and leads up to perhaps the highest point of the album: Lie. Probably the heaviest song on the album, Lie is also very catchy and has an extremely memorable chorus. LaBrie makes an intresting use of using hushed vocals during the verses and his aggressive rasp in the choruse before the song ends with an extended guitar solo which features a brief reprisal of The Mirror. Lifting Shadows Off a Dream is another truly unique track, being a sort of ambient and tranquil power ballad while also using deep bass and melodic keyboards. The penultimate song is Scarred. While, like Voices, it doesn't live up to other nine-plus minute songs the band has been known for, it is much more solid than Voices, starting off quiet and tranquil before picking up in aggression and speed in the verses, without sacrificing any of its ambience, before reverting to a melodic and tranquil chorus. It is also heralded as perhaps LaBrie's best performance on the album, as he shows off the dynamics of his range most prominently in this song. Scarred may not be the feat of musicianship that Learning to Live was, but keeping in mind that it is more straightforward and direct than Learning to Live, Scarred still succeeds in most parts as being an \"epic\" track. And with that, you would think the album had come to a satisfying conclusion. But there's one more surprise left.\n\nThe final song is the last work of Kevin Moore, who left just as the album was completed: Space-Dye Vest. This song is without a doubt the band's most bizarre and uncharacteristic song (the song has never been performed by the band live and was acknowledged that it would not have made the album if the band knew Kevin was leaving). It is largely a dark and melancholic piano ballad that becomes increasingly more haunting with low piano keys and hushed vocals and becomes increasingly bizarre with various sound clips of movies about love and obsession to complement the lyrical content (it's about how Moore fell in love with a magazine model wearing the famous vest) and it is quite a while before the rest of the band joins in, while the piano and keyboards remain dominant. At first, I was taken aback by the song and was upset that this was chosen to close the album rather than Scarred because it seemingly had no place on the album. But it will eventually grow on you after a few listens and is honestly a very interesting and haunting piece of music. Still, it's kind of a weird way to end the album and ulitmately leaves me with mixed feelings.\n\n6:00, Caught in a Web, Innocence Faded, and Lie are ultimately strong enough tracks to hold up the album. However, while the rest of the album remains somewhat hit-and-miss, songs such as Erotomania, The Mirror, Lifting Shadows Off a Dream, and Scarred are also very solid. This is not necessarily the best album to listen to songs just by themselves (accept the first three and Lie), but if one listens to Awake from beginning to end without interruption, the pieces all come together well and ends up being one of Dream Theater's most solid releases. Even if I will continue to have somewhat mixed feelings about Voices, The Silent Man, and Space-Dye Vest (which are not bad, just \"kinda good\" and \"what the hell?\"), the quality of excellent combined with solid outweighs (for the most part) the songs that are somewhat lacking. Fans of Images and Words may need to give Awake a few listens before they truly appreciate its quality, but it ultimately pays off. While not their most consistently strong albums, Awake remains an essential Dream Theater release.\n",
        "\nSo many reviews have been written for this album, and not just on Metal Archives, and yet I feel the need to review this. Why? Well, basically because this album as had one of the biggest influences on my life. I love music deeply. Music is one of my biggest ties with the world. I find musicians who can express emotions and life events through music to be some of the greatest human beings on the Earth. I need to review this album because Dream Theater have summoned some of the most powerful emotions I have ever felt in my life, and this is why Images And Words is one of the greatest records in the world.\n\nI have heard so many records in my life, and I have heard every single Dream Theater album, and even though I know all the musicians from this band and their other projects with other bands, but it seems that this one time they sat together and started working on this magnificent record, they had something going on between them that was so beautiful, so perfect, that it managed to create one of the most beautiful pieces of art of this world. Some might think this is an overstatement, but I don\u2019t. I think music is about what objectively exists, of course but it is also about feeling. One might not listen to this record like I do, so this is why I feel the need to review this. I need to express my own feelings toward this album and explain why I think this is one of the best records I have ever heard.\n\nEven though Dream Theater has been one of the most unbelievable and fantastic band throughout their whole career, this one record stands out. You cannot find the feeling, emotion and uniqueness of Images and Words on any other Dream Theater record. This is to me, their best album. On this album James LaBrie seems to be telling the listener a story, a tale. As you embark this journey, you will feel all of the vocalist\u2019s emotions and stories, and this is one of the reasons why this album is so good. James LaBrie doesn\u2019t just give one of his best performances, he lives it. If the music just isn\u2019t enough, you will feel the lyrics penetrating your subconscious and you will feel touched. That is at least what happened for me. I felt touched. Whenever I listen to Surrounded at night, I feel just like I am in Dream Theater. I love living my life at night, looking at the stars and feeling the cold wind as I watch the moon. Surrounded makes you feel like walking in the streets at night and watch the world as it sleeps. Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper also has an amazing impact with its progressive melodic music, but also with the lyrics. This particular section makes my heart beat very fast: \u201cAs a child, I thought I could live without pain, without sorrow. As a man I've found it's all caught up with me, I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid.\u201d\n\nI have talked about the lyrics, but haven\u2019t talked about the music yet. I cannot describe every single instrument and explain why they are all amazing on this record because every single track is unique. This might sound like a cheap excuse not to dig deeper and explain why every musician makes an amazing individual effort to make this album unique, but I\u2019m absolutely serious about this. You really can\u2019t even hope to be able to explain why this album is amazing if you analyze every single instrument one by one throughout the whole album. Let\u2019s just say that this album is all about synergy. This album isn\u2019t great because the guitar stands out, or the bass or vocals stands out, but rather because none stands out more than the other. All of them just fit perfectly together. Never ever through your listen you should feel like any of the musicians is stealing the show. And this is why the album is so beautiful and amazing. Images And Words is all about harmony and cooperation.\n\nListening through Images And Words, you never feel bored. Every single track is unique. Some of the tracks are more melodic, some of them are more progressive and some of them are less complex and more emotive. Most amazing thing about this album is that some of the tracks are so diversified, they manage to be simple, than more complex or aggressive than very smooth. This is the case for tracks like Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper and Learning To Live which are both fantastic for all the beautiful melodic parts with great vocals and emotive crescendos and also magnificent instrumental and progressive parts where the musicians all just jump into the tracks to show off some of the most amazing technical but also great song-writing skills ever heard.\n\nThe simple complexity of this record is what makes it an outstanding album. Simple complexity might sound like a pleonasm but it really isn\u2019t. What I mean by simple complexity is that Dream Theater manages to write very elaborate music while keeping is simple enough to be catchy, melodic and accessible. While accessible is for a lot of people often a synonym of commercial mediocre music, it isn\u2019t the case for Images And Words. This one records manages to be accessible, elaborate and intelligent all at the same time.\n\nImages And Words is also beautiful because of a reason I have previously stated. If you listen to the whole album in one sit, you will feel like you are getting told a story. Not that the tracks all assemble as one big story, but the feeling of the music just flows perfectly and never creates an unwanted and unexpected breakdown. The music just flows perfectly through the whole album as it was meant to be. Even the sudden ending of Pull Me Under won\u2019t seem to be out of place when the last note of the album stops ringing in your ears. Everything on this record is at the perfect place at the perfect time.\n\nAnd if it wasn\u2019t enough already, the albums ends with Learning To Live, right after the beautiful and so emotive track Wait For Sleep. Learning To Live is one of the most mind-blowing progressive tracks in the history of music. For this track alone, Dream Theater deserves to stand beside bands like Gentle Giant, King Crimson and Symphony X. Fans of progressive metal all probably knows about Symphony X\u2019s track named The Odyssey, which is an amazing progressive odyssey. The track Learning To Live is just like The Odyssey. It\u2019s a whole journey on its own and it also happens to be the last track of the album. For a listener like me, this if the fatal blow. Dream Theater will just kill you with this masterpiece. Once you get there you will have already heard some of the amazing records of all times, but Learning To Live doesn\u2019t have any mercy. It will bring your higher and higher. It will bring you higher than you ever expected. To keep up with the good job they have done on the rest of the record, the musicians of Dream Theater deliver one of the most complex yet very melodic and accessible tracks to close this gem of an album.\n\nWhen the album ends, you just want more. You want to hear more of this musical beauty. This might be why the track Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper got itself its own sequel. That\u2019s right; Dream Theater released an album named Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory as a sequel to this one masterpiece of a track that is Metropolis Pt. 1. If this isn\u2019t enough to tell you how much of a beauty this track is, then I guess nothing will convince you to listen to this album. For all the others, just don\u2019t wait and give this masterpiece a listen... or twenty!\n",
        "\nSingles. Hard to give a decent review because for the most part they are the songs that a fan will love no matter what, but on the other hand will prefer other songs that aren't as well know. Such goes for some other bands. Perfect example would Slayer. Everyone knows \"Raining Blood\" and \"Angel of Death\"...everyone loves them, but I can damn well sure fans would rather listen to say \"Hell Awaits\", \"Black Magic\", \"Chemical Warfare\", or \"War Ensemble\". Or a band such as Alice In Chains...everyone knows \"Man In the Box\" and/or \"Would,\" but truth be told we would rather hear songs like \"Nutshell\", \"We Die Young\", \"Angry Chair\", etc. Look at both of the bands I gave examples and you might say to yourself \"Well Siggy, those are their most well-know known and fan favorites. You're kinda contradicting the point you are trying to prove here.\"....don't worry about that, I'm about to get to it my friend. Bottom line is that with a lot of mainstream top 10/20/40/50/100/etc. lists when it comes to Hard Rock/Heavy Metal artists it's always the big name singles like AiC's \"Man In the Box\" or Slayer's \"Raining Blood/Angel of Death\" that always gets named. But for a band like Dream Theater, as a fan....I honestly can't think of any of their other songs that I would prefer to listen to outside of their biggest hit single \"Pull me Under\". I own a few of their albums and have heard the rest via Youtube.com or Spotify, etc....none of them seem to hit the epic heights as what \"Pull me Under\" has to offer to the listener.\n\n\"Pull Me Under\" was/is/will always be Dream Theater's most well-known for specific reasons. It prove that you can make Judas Priest get progressive. And I am talking about Judas Priest via \"Painkiller\"-era to. No, I am not shitting you. \"Pull Me Under\" is nothing more than DT getting in touch with their inner metal head selves and going \"Fuck it, let's go for it.\" The song starts out with a very moody and sombre opening. Once you hear it, it already sets the mood in you know something big and frightening is about to happen. Then after the intro melody the drums and guitars pick up a little bit more before the nice little dunna-dunn-dun dunna-dunn-dun riff kicks in with the beautiful sounding arpeggio which transforms into a nice groove that will have anyone headbanging in a split second. James Labrie's vocals are on fire which goes from a certain impending doom of him observing this future event (\"Lost in the sky/Clouds roll by and I roll with them/Arrows fly/Seas increase\nand then fall again). At this point his vocals become more sincere in the pre-chorus lyricsThis world is spinning around me (This world is spinning without me/Every day send future to past/Every breath leaves me one less\nto my last) sounding like he on the verge of pure panic, and then BOOM! James Labrie not only goes into his best Rob Halford-esque vocals, but the rest of the band speeds up to the point where it is nothing short of Judas Priest \"Painkiller\" with the great Mike Portnoy beating the shit out of his drums. Also at this point the lyrics become even more cryptic (Watch the sparrow falling/Gives new meaning to it all/If not today nor yet tomorrow/then some other day. I'll take seven lives for one/And then my only father's son/As sure as I did ever love him/I am not afraid). I honestly don't know what James Labrie is talking about here, but lyrically speaking that's poetry to the point where you can sense James' sense of crying out for help. This song is probably the only song where his vocals get the point across because honestly, vocally-speaking, most of when he sings it is falling between very fruity power metal-ish type singing to almost whiny. I'm not saying he's terrible, but for this song \"Pull me Under\", he finally hits the notes in making the listener feel his sense of panic. The rest of the song is more or less the same.\n\nAnd I'll just admit I'm pretty lazy trying to motivate myself to review the entire album \"Images & Words\", but that album is so progressive I would get lost in trying to review it myself. I don't do so favorably well with reviewing things that make me think past crappy 80's-influenced bands/crappy Bathory-influenced bands/crappy lo fi bands that dwell in rain forests/etc. But this is as good as you'll get from me for a DT review, and possibly the best you will get from Dream Theater in terms of a solid fucking metal song. Enjoy.\n",
        "\nI think it\u2019s safe to say at this point that when Dream Theater came out, they established themselves as the leader of the pack of progressive metal bands who had exploded out of the scene in the early \u201990s. The band\u2019s 1992 album Images and Words solidified their style and popularity. It fused Fates Warning\u2019s soaring vocals and melodic yet mean power metal\u2013influenced riffs with Rush\u2019s jazzy, time signature\u2013defying drum work and cinematic, almost guitar solo\u2013natured keyboarding and 20-minute suites. \n\nDespite this, it only took until their fourth album for the band to vomit all over themselves with the commercial interest\u2013driven and dismal Falling into Infinity. After Falling, Dream Theater\u2019s young career was at stake, and the band knew that the follow-up would have to be bloody brilliant in order for the band to stay together. What resulted was a progressive metal masterpiece that would unfortunately be the last undeniable highlight of the band\u2019s career: Metropolis Part 2: Scenes from a Memory. \n\nThis album is a sequel to the song Metropolis on the aforementioned Images and Words. A 20-minute-long sequel was originally written for Falling into Infinity, until the label asked them to ditch all of the work and go in a more commercial direction, so on this release the band decided to revive the story and instead make a whole album around it. The concept revolves around a man named Nicholas, who has been plagued by disturbing dreams and intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu from another life. He sees a hypnotherapist to help him understand these dreams, and eventually finds out he is being used as a puppet by the ghost of a woman named Victoria, to expose the truth of her murder in 1928.\n\nThe album comes in from a lot of musical angles, bouncing between Nicholas in the real world and Victoria in the dream world. It uses the heavy, bouncy, and somewhat schizophrenically paced metal parts to display the anxiety, confusion, and obsession on Nicholas\u2019s side, and the horror, pain, and dread on Victoria\u2019s. These aspects are the highlight of the album. Not only are these some of Dream Theater\u2019s best riffs, but songs like \u201cDance of Eternity,\u201d \u201cHome,\u201d and \u201cFatal Tragedy\u201d highlight how excellent every single one of the members in Dream Theater is at their respective instruments.\n\nAll these aspects are then glued together by clean, keyboard-based ballads that, although they create a contrast and connect the record together, aren\u2019t really notable and tend to drag on. There are four pure ballads in total, and a few of them drop in out of nowhere in the middle of a head-spinning progressive metal track. Two tracks in a row of such ballads isn\u2019t a great progression, either. I\u2019m listening to the musical equivalent of a gripping supernatural crime drama, guys, not riding an elevator to the 45th floor of a hotel.\n\nJoking aside, this is the record that kept Dream Theater from losing hope and staying relevant into the\u201900s. Sadly, the band would never reach the same critical heights again. The follow-up, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, was a double album that shouldn\u2019t have been a double album. It marked the start of the band\u2019s lack of experimentation and the cementation of the same formula that would be used over and over again to this day. Still, this is the record that kept the band together and showed that along with Images and Words, Awake, and the \u201cChange of Seasons\u201d EP, Dream Theater is a force of progressive metal to be reckoned with. 8.5/10\n",
        "\nWhile 'Stargazer' as a cover certainly isn't anything super-special for Dream Theater, it's definately not a bad tribute to one of the old greats. After having listened to the 'Uncovered (2008-2009)' EP several times, I can safely say that this is the track that I listen to least. That's not to say however, that it's not good. It's great.\n\nWhy it doesn't deserve such a high rating is because Dream Theater (a very innovative and creative unit) doesn't really do anything to make the song their own, and unlike an exceptionally well-done cover like 'Odyssey,' it doesn't seem like they really tried to add their own touch to it.\n\nOn a plus note however, the song really shows what a versatile vocalist James LaBrie really is. While he was about to properly tribute Freddie Mercury's vocal style in the Queen medley (off the 'Uncovered' EP) he does the same for 'Stargazer,' keeping the trademark Dio inflections and enunciations intact.\n\nA good tribute, but for someone that isn't a big fan of Dream Theater, it's better to try out the old classic.\n",
        "\nWhile I was never a big fan of the 'Awake' record, I have to say, this was one of my least favourite tracks from that album. While Dream Theater made it clear they wanted 'Awake' to be a very heavy piece of work, the overbearing heaviness really does not work for this track. Despite having a memorable chorus and sound structure, an unfitting abrasiveness about it and a sub par vocal performance from James LaBrie makes this a Dream Theater song that as a fan; I prefer to overlook.\n\nWhile Dream Theater has never been a band to conform to anyone's expectations, I certainly liked the sonic palette they used on both prior and future releases. Instead of relying on beautifully technical guitar work to push the song along, power chords are the norm here, backed up by some keyboards to give extra depth to the sound. In any case, the obviously 'dark' nature of the song does not fit well with a lighter-sounding synth section, which puts me off from much sense of atmosphere.\n\nWhile James LaBrie ranks as being one of my favourite vocalists and a singer with a whole lot of potential, he is not always consistent in the quality of his performance. This is evident here with 'Caught In A Web;' while he often makes the high notes really ring beautifully, he sounds like he is trying too hard to be 'heavy' to go with the overall nature of the track.\n\nWhile 'Awake' would be blessed with some phenomenal tracks and some people might find this song more enjoyable than I, it does not fit my tastes at all. To date, 'Caught In A Web' ranks as being one of my least enjoyed songs that Dream Theater has produced; certainly not a great choice of single to introduce new potential fans to.\n",
        "\nIt's finally happening. Earlier today, Roadrunner Records released the first single for the upcoming Dream Theater album, entitled 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events'. With Mike Portnoy having left the band late last year and a new drummer taking his place, there is great anticipation to hear what this new incarnation of Dream Theater sounds like. Although fake leaks aplenty were circling the internet, 'On The Backs Of Angels' is the first we get to hear of the real thing, and coming from someone who has been a huge fan of the band for the better part of a decade, the single has not disappointed. At nearly nine minutes in length, 'On The Backs Of Angels' really isn't what I would normally think of when it comes to a single. And going with the territory, there are plenty of instrumental sections for the band to really strut their stuff with the new drummer, Mike Mangini. Although the music here is nothing new for Dream Theater, I have not been disappointed; this song is excellent.\n\nIt begins with some proggy mellow guitars that lead the song into something much heavier; a nearly symphonic progressive metal that really underlines the dark sounds the band has started gravitating towards in order to compete with other bands. Instrumentally, the band is in top form here, and its much what one would come to expect of this band. The real focus here is on Petrucci and Rudess, who have quite a few moments to the two of them where they really shred, but it all feels intentioned and composed, rather than shallow technicality like many of the band's detractors would attest to. Coming as a bit of a disappointment is Mike Mangini's drum performance here. Although the drums were written by Petrucci, Mangini's performance doesn't feel like anything particularly excellent here, save for some interesting accents he makes towards the introduction of the song. Vocally, James LaBrie's voice begins somewhat blandly, but it makes up for it later in the song where he takes control of a brilliant chorus, and some very effective harmonies here and there.\n\n'On The Backs Of Angels' is a very promising start to the upcoming record, and now that the time is getting so close, I'm really beginning to feel excitement for this.\n",
        "\nLove them or hate them, Dream Theater have been one of the most influential, and successful bands in modern progressive rock. On top of laying the groundwork style for every other progressive metal band out there today, this band has been the centre of constant debate between people that virtually worship them for their virtuosity as musicians and talent, and others that condemn them for what they perceive as needless showmanship at the sacrifice of real substance. Chances are that coming onto this review, you may already have a potentially strong opinion about Dream Theater, and what they are all about. For me, this was a band that- along with other legends like Rush and Led Zeppelin- got me big into music when I was first beginning to explore beyond what my parents showed me. Their classic albums 'Images & Words' and 'Scenes From A Memory' have had an indelible impact on my development as a musician and listener, and I've loved a fair bit of what they have done since then. Admittedly, I found myself a little weary of Dream Theater's indulgent style around the time that the band's 2011 single 'On The Backs Of Angels' was announced, but all the same I went into listening to it, and was immediately impressed. The appropriately titled 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' has been met with a great deal of anticipation from alot of people, first considering that it is a Dream Theater album, but also because this is the first album that their lifelong drummer Mike Portnoy does not appear on, after being given the boot by the rest of the band. With one of their founding members gone, it was natural to expect that his departure- and the arrival of Annihilator drummer and Dream Theater newbie Mike Mangini- to have an impact on the band's direction. Portnoy was the one that pushed for Dream Theater to have a heavier sound, so I had been expecting a more progressive edge this time around, and that is exactly what 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' is about; the same proggy excellence that first got me into them. While I can imagine the legions of detractors using the seemingly unchanged sound of the band against them, I for one have been greatly satisfied by this new batch of band material, and even with one of their vital organs missing, Dream Theater is far from dead.\n\nAs was the case with the past two albums of Dream Theater, sitting down to give my first listen to the material was a very important, almost somewhat spiritual experience, especially considering that I believed only a few months before that Dream Theater was all but dead. Both fans and haters should know that there is very little that will surprise them here necessarily, but the music here is easily distinguishable from other albums, especially what they have done more recently. While I did love 'Systematic Chaos' and 'Black Clouds & Silver Linings', the removal of the contrived heaviness and Gothic darkness that Dream Theater unsuccessfully tried to evoke on previous records is a refreshing change. Dream Theater are still definitely a progressive metal band, but of that formula, the emphasis here is on that of the 'progressive', rather than the thrashy Metallica, or pseudo-death metal that Mike Portnoy kept thinking was a pretty cool and hip thing for Dream Theater to do. Besides that, this is a Dream Theater album, complete with cheesy album artwork, epic songs, virtuosic musicianship, and the apparent effort to see how much of a CD's space can be used up without making it a double album.\n\nAfter my first listen to 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events', I was silent for a few minutes, trying to figure out what I thought of it. This was Dream Theater alright, but I wasn't exactly sure whether I liked it or not. Although my general impression of the album has vastly increased since first listen to this album, some of the things I noticed on first listen have stuck with me. First off, the instrumental sections here no longer have the needless sense to them, and as far as the 'technical' elements of Dream Theater go, this may be the best I've ever heard them. With the handful of longer, ten minute plus tracks, each goes into some sort of departure from the regular songwriting in order to blow the listeners away with the talents of each member. Keyboardist Jordan Rudess really shines here, and I find myself replaying these instrumental parts. What I used to consider 'noodling' from these guys doesn't sound too different on first impression, but the band has put a much greater sense of complexity here into the instrumentals that I haven't quite heard from the band before. Suffice to say, haters of Dream Theater will probably still hate Dream Theater for these instrumental 'battles', but for someone who has loved them for almost a decade, the technical instrumentation here has never sounded more thoughtful. 'Bridges In The Sky', and the album's epic highlight 'Breaking All Illusions' both have the go-to elements of this.\n\nThe other aspect of this album is the melodic, songwriting side. I was never anything short of impressed by the familiar talent and skill exerted on the instrumental side of Dream Theater's material here, but as far as the songwriting went, 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' took a few listens to warm up to me. This is largely because half of these songs are quite long and complex. 'On The Backs Of Angels' is the most instantly memorable track here, although there is much better to hear on the album. 'This Is The Life' is a brilliant mid-tempo prog rocker in a somewhat mellow vein, with a gorgeous chorus to boot. 'Bridges In The Sky' (originally given the less promising title 'The Shaman's Trance') has a real 'Glass Prison' vibe to it, but the dark progressive metal moments are contrasted with vibrant melodies and feeling. 'Far From Heaven' is a gentle piano piece that may very well hit me harder than any of Dream Theater's ballads. Here, James LaBrie's vocals and the gorgeous violins make my heart bleed rainbows. The only song here I really do not care for much is 'Build Me Up, Break Me Down', which has a similar sound to 'Caught In A Web', from 1994's 'Awake' album. It is not a terrible track, but there's nothing about it that really jumps out at me; a single bump in an otherwise awesome experience.\n\nThe true highlight here is 'Breaking All Illusions', which I can see Dream Theater fans idolizing throughout the coming months. The song has every element of an 'epic' to it, except that it is only a relatively brief twelve minutes long, as opposed to well, you know, a 'true' long song. We have one of John Petrucci's greatest guitar solos towards the end, prog metal freakouts, slower, almost Floydian mellow segments, and some of their most memorable riffs to date. Also of great importance to note is James LaBrie's performance on this, and on all other tracks on the album. He- like much of Dream Theater's sound- is another point of contention that people will argue about until breakfast time, and while he has had his moments where even I question his abilities, his vocal performance here shows him in his element. He is definitely not the sort of singer that he used to be with 'Images & Words', but he is no longer trying to sound like he is in Metallica, in other words, being something he is not. Here, he is trying to sound like James LaBrie, and his voice here is warm and full of feeling, especially on the gorgeous 'Far From Heaven' and closing ballad 'Beneath The Surface'. I would have like to have hear him pull off a few more high notes throughout the album, but I'm not disappointed. Also- lest I forget to mention- is Mike Mangini's performance, another thing that Dream Theater fans will continue to debate 'til past noon. Sadly, as the newest member of Dream Theater, he seems to get the newbie's treatment in terms of mixing, and his drum performance is less audible to me than Portnoy's work; hell, even bassist John Myung can be heard playing on this album now finally. While the drum recording could have used a little more life to it, Mangini's performance fills in the shoes of Portnoy very well, although I would be hard pressed to say he does more than that. There are techniques here where I could have sworn it was Portnoy playing, and I do not think this is coincidence; maybe Dream Theater is trying to warm up their fans to a new drummer, but I think it will take until the next album to hear what this new drummer is truly capable of.\n\nAs with all Dream Theater albums, this is an album I have some strong opinions about, although I am positive there are others- even other fans of the band- that will see things in a completely different light. 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' took me a little longer to fully appreciate than much of the other more recent material that Dream Theater has churned out, but giving it the time it deserves, I've found it to be an incredibly strong, albeit flawed album. There is still some cheese to grate off the edges of the band's sound, and one less- than-satisfying track towards the beginning does tend to have me argue against this being labelled as a 'masterpiece', but does this stand its ground against other albums by the band? Yes, and more than that; it shows them taking some of their less tasteful aspects and injecting more thought into them, making the overall sound of Dream Theater all the more powerful. Agree with me or not, 'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' has wowed me and impressed me more and more with each time I listen to it, and I can see myself giving it the same long-term appreciation as I do most of the band's material.\n",
        "\nDream Theater have been wobbling precariously from the sublime to the ridiculous for the past decade, the CDs released being unpredictable affairs that veer with alarming ease from the instrumental maelstroms that should be expected of a progressive metal titan to downright embarrassing efforts to prove their \u2018metal\u2019 credentials with dumbed down attempts to appeal to the youth of today.\n\nThe blame for these misadventures has been dumped by many squarely at the door of famously departed drummer Mike Portnoy, and it has to be said that in his absence, the rest of the band have written a balanced CD that sounds as though they are merely doing their own thing and not attempting to prove anything to anyone.\n\nRegardless of the personnel involved, the most notable thing about \u2018A dramatic turn of events\u2019 is that it is resolutely a Dream Theater CD. There are no awkward \u201cSounds like... Muse?\u201d moments or eye-rollingly obvious attempts to reach out to the Slipknot crowd with brazen, chugging groove riffs. And to be honest the promise of never having to hear Portnoy\u2019s dreadful tough guy vocals contaminating another Dream Theater song again is almost enough to justify his departure in itself.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t a few hairy moments that prove beyond doubt that the drummer wasn\u2019t the sole factor in the more \u2018modern\u2019 aspect of the band in recent times. The 2nd track, \u201cBuild me up, break me down\u201d prominently features some unpleasant buzzing guitars and pretty horrid shrieks backing the main vocals on the pre-chorus, as well as some pointless programmed beats cluttering things up. A real weak point on the CD, it is thankfully an isolated incident that is far outweighed by the more positive aspects.\n\nOn the whole it is a smooth CD that definitely sounds far less fragmented than many of its recent predecessors, and is as usual at its best when acting as a showcase for the assembled musicians\u2019 astounding talents. New drummer Mike Mangini (who else, really?) is given a tactful introduction, and doesn\u2019t embarrass himself or his new colleagues by trying to outdo Portnoy. Rather, he turns in a typically assured display that covers every inch of the kit on the more intricate moments as well as getting on with some head-down double-bass thumping on the faster songs like \u201cLost not forgotten\u201d.\n\nBallads have been an area where they have stumbled as often as they have succeeded through their entire career, so it is a nice bonus that the 2 on this CD turn out to be very pleasing. \u201cFar from heaven\u201d is a gentle piano piece, while the closing \u201cBeneath the surface\u201d seems to be an acoustic-only affair before some unsubtle but charming keyboards abruptly take over. What both share are great performances from James Labrie at the microphone, reflective of a strong overall display free of any ridiculous attempts at sounding like a hard man on the heavier songs.\n\nThe standout for me though is the stunning \u201cBreaking all illusions\u201d which has the most classic-sounding Dream Theater vibe of the lot, the graceful lead guitar and keyboard interchanges soothing and majestic, and the expected flurries of syncopation dazzling without getting too boastful about it.\n\nNow for all the encouraging things it promises and in many cases delivers, it has to be said that \u2018A dramatic turn of events\u2019 is far from a flawless CD. One thing I will say about 2007\u2019s divisive \u2018Systematic chaos\u2019 and indeed its better-liked follow-up \u2018Black clouds and silver linings\u2019 is that they both got off to galloping starts with very impressive opening tracks. Here, \u201cOn the backs of angels\u201d is rather sedated and while it has a few nice moments doesn\u2019t really get out of first gear, meaning the CD on the whole doesn\u2019t properly get going until the 3rd track.\n\nThe majority of the songs of course spin off in many directions from their opening bars, and while many like \u201cThis is the life\u201d impress from start to finish, a couple travel through places less interesting than their beginnings and ends and don\u2019t fully justify their protracted running times. But despite this, it is an assured and enjoyable experience on the whole and the sound of Dream Theater just getting on with being Dream Theater brings joy to the heart.\n\nAfter years of spiralling all over the place, they now seem to finally be pulling in the same direction and have produced a unified, stylistically consistent, and admittedly far from perfect batch of songs that give hope for at most a launching point for something greater, or at least safety from further self-inflicted humiliation. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com)\n",
        "\nDream Theater is considered as one of the most influential, if not the most influential band of the prog metal scene over the last 25 years. As an avid fan myself, I was more than excited to know how their new album, A Dramatic Turn of Events, would turn out (no pun intended). After all, the album was their first album without founder and long-time drummer Mike Portnoy.\n\nDream Theater\u2019s musical direction over the last years concerned me a little. 2007\u2019s Systematic Chaos was, to me, the lowest point of their creative process with uninspiring lyrics and borderline boring and monotonous instrumental sections. While 2009\u2019s Black Clouds and Silver Linings was a more refreshing attempt, their formula of long songs and \u201cin-your-face\u201d metal combined with trade-off solos between keyboardist Jordan Rudess and guitarist John Petrucci was starting to get stale. A Dramatic Turn of Events would be a definitive album to determine if DT was starting to run out of ideas or if it would find again a sound that would fit them completely.\n\nBut you can see things would be different even with looking at the cover of the album. As opposed to the dark, crowded images of their two previous albums, this album\u2019s cover is a more tranquil, lightened one, a sign of hope that would be increased when the first track and single for the album, \u201cOn the Backs of Angels\u201d, started. Unlike their previous efforts, this time their opening song is a calm yet mysterious guitar intro accompanied by soft keyboards in the background as the drums (this time played by new drummer Mike Mangini) start. The sound of the band is completely different in this track compared to their previous album, focusing more in a balance between metal and progressive music rather than just \u201cmetal with odd signatures\u201d. John Myung\u2019s bass can actually be heard again after being absent for almost 5 years behind Petrucci\u2019s guitar lines. James LaBrie\u2019s voice sounds more melodic while still fitting the heavier parts of the song. On the Backs of Angels, even while having a weak chorus, promises a different Dream Theater throughout the album.\n\nAnd the promise is clearly delivered. \u201cBuild Me Up, Break Me Down\u201d follows and shows that DT has gone more experimental ways. While not as good as the first song, this song, while heavy, also shows some kind of Industrial influence, mainly due to Rudess\u2019 keyboard sounds. A stand out for these two songs so far is that, even when they do have their respective instrumental breaks, don\u2019t fall into a solo show-off between keyboard and guitar, fitting more into the songs. Another heavy song goes next, \u201cLost not Forgotten\u201d, a reminder of the heavy sound of their latest albums. A piano introduces the song and thank Rudess for that as piano hasn\u2019t been present in any DT album since maybe Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence or Octavarium\u2019s ballads. Come to think about it, keyboards are presented in a different way on this album so far and aren't only used for solos and background atmosphere, but as an instrument in itself, playing along with the rest of instruments instead of behind or too above them. Even though the cheesy lyrics and a brief monotonous trade-off solo, luckily the only one of the album, the chorus is pretty cool and the song sounds good overall. The heaviness takes a break in \u201cThis is the Life\u201d, the album\u2019s first ballad. While the song might be confusing at times, it\u2019s good to hear the band making an unconventional ballad again (not following the verse-chorus-verse format). Two long tracks go next, \u201cBridges in the Sky\u201d and \u201cOutcry\u201d. \u201cBridges in the Sky\u201d is an epic track (don\u2019t pay attention to the almost hilarious intro) that almost defines the DT sound as of today. Heavy riffs combined perfectly with soft, dreamy sections and an incredible ending. Flow between all the instruments is incredible. Mangini\u2019s drumming is great and doesn\u2019t sound as loud as Portnoy in the latest albums and Andy Wallace\u2019s overall work in mixing is outstanding. \u201cOutcry\u201d, on the other hand, is a song with an amazing main riff that explores the progressive side of DT again (again experimenting with some electric sounds at the beginning), reminding of songs like \u201cThe Dance of Eternity\u201d and the instrumental breaks of \u201cBeyond this Life\u201d and the always classic \u201cMetropolis\u201d. Unlike \u201cBridges\u201d, this song\u2019s ending seems rushed and improvised and it ruins the overall purpose of the song. The second ballad of the album ensues, an emotionally charged song named \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d, written by James LaBrie. A reminder of songs like \u201cVacant\u201d, this song only consists of him and Rudess playing piano. It's a sad song with great lyrics to take a break again from the long, heavy songs that are played before it.\n\nBut then comes the amazing \u201cBreaking All Illusions\u201d, my favorite track from the album hands down. \u201cBreaking\u2026\u201d features the return of John Myung to writing lyrics (and a pretty awesome return if you ask me). A thing that I noticed in this album is that all the instruments seem balanced again. In previous albums, the songs seemed to feature mostly guitar and drums leading the songs. This time is different. It doesn\u2019t seem like an instrument is \u201cleading\u201d the song, but as if all the instruments form the song altogether (vocals included). This song is flawless. Petrucci\u2019s solo is incredible (\"Lines in the Sand\"-reminiscent), LaBrie\u2019s delivery fits like a glove, and the overall vibe of the album is good, joining metal elements with prog elements instead of having them apart in the same song. An uplifting track, \u201cBreaking All Illusions\u201d might be their best song since \u201cOctavarium\u201d and one of their best songs of their career. \n\nJohn Petrucci described the last song of the album, \u201cBeneath the Surface\u201d, as the kind of song that goes in the credits right after a song has ended, and that\u2019s exactly what it is, a soothing acoustic ballad that ends the album in an incredible song. Of all the things DT has revived in this album, an acoustic ballad might be one of the things they needed to revive the most. After all, all the acoustic ballads they\u2019ve made are beautiful (\u201cThe Silent Man\u201d, \u201cHollow Years\u201d). Just like the previous song, \u201cBeneath the Surface\u201d is an uplifting, \u201chappy\u201d song that concludes the epic voyage that DT has composed this time and at the same time states that the band has found their sound again, the true meaning behind being a progressive metal band.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Portnoy\u2019s leaving was a good thing, but it did open the door to a new and refreshing sound. Is it a return to form? Not really. I personally think it\u2019s Dream Theater taking all the experience from their albums (from their most progressive like Images and Words to their heaviest like Train of Thought) and putting it together to form what I think is their definitive sound and forming one of the best albums of the year as well.\n\nHighlights: Bridges in the Sky, Far From Heaven, Breaking All Illusions, Beneath the Surface\nLow Points: Build Me Up, Break Me Down\n",
        "\nOnly two years after the amazing last release \"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\" Dream Theater are back with a bang. They got a lot of media attention because of their split with founding member and drum workaholic Mike Portnoy who now tries to sue the band and doesn't only scrap his professional career but also his image, his friendship with the other members and finally his credibility. Thumbs down for Mike Portnoy but thumbs up for the other guys of Dream Theater who were able to write a very strong record even without the controling influence of Mike Portnoy. Most of the songs on here are written as a team. Jordann Rudess did an amazing job and sound stronger than ever on this record. Lets notice that he also wrote the drum patterns for the record that the new and very sympathetic drum monster Miek Mangini copied in his studio. He is the only new member who didn't have a writing credit on this record and I'm looking forward to see what this guy is able to play and write in a bright future with Dream Theater. Of course, John Petrucci is once again an important corner stone of this record and had many great ideas. James LaBrie gets some more credits on this record than before and his vocals sound more effortless and amazing than ever before. Even they shy guy John Myung got back on track and wrote a lot of music and also some lyrics on this album. Everything seems equilibrated on this album and Portnoy's departure seems to be a relief and released a lot of fresh creativity within the different band members. These are the reasons why this album turns out to be so strong.\n\nEnter \"A Dramatic Turn Of Events\". I described the previous record as a great compilation and mixture of styles from albums such as \"Six Degress Of Inner Turbulence\", \"Train Of Thoughts\" or \"Systematic Chaos\" and this new record is the equivalent force to it. It touches calmer and more progressive sounds that made me adore records such as \"Images And Words\", \"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory\" or \"Octavarium\". The opener \"On The Backs Of Angels\" needs some time to grow but ultimately convinces with beautiful guitar harmonies and atmospheric keyboard section. Especially the calmest and most progressive tracks on this album are amazing like the catchy and yet epic anthem \"Breaking All Illusions\" or the touching and introspective ballad \"Beneath The Surface\". \n\nBut the band is even more diversified than this and has added some thrash orientated and modern sounds into a couple of songs that could come straight from \"Train Of Thoughts\" or \"Systematic Chaos\". The greatest example is the brilliant \"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\" that has many heavy and modern sounds but a catchy and beautiful chorus that contrasts the stunning beginning of the song. The great thing about this album is that it touches many different styles, ideas and genres but the choice of the track list still glues the nine songs coherently together. Every song has something different to show us even if we have heard bits and pieces of the diversified styles in many other Dream Theater albums before. This record presents us nothing new but it stagnates on a very strong level and is an important transitional album and new beginning after the departure of Mike Portnoy. This record should unite old and young fans and as I recognized, this album pleases as much to those who cite \"Awake\" as their favourite album as to those who would put \"Train Of Thoughts\" on the top of their list. That's a rare and stunning effort. With the last record, the band seems to have been able to develop away to catalyze their different styles into a well mixed melting pot of genius.\n\nEvery Dream Theater album has one song that truly stands out in my opinion and even though all songs are pretty great on this new effort, this is still the case on here. I talk about the amazing \"Bridges In The Sky\" that has almost made it as the title track of the album. The song mixes haunting shaman chants with atmospheric choirs, keyboards passages and even new age influences that lead to heavy and almost thrash orientated verses and beautiful choruses. Every instrument plus the vocals shine in this masterpiece that I would put slightly in front of the other stunning epics \"Breaking All Illusions\", followed by \"Outcry\" and finally \"Lost Not Forgotten\". This song contains everything Dream Theater is still about in 2011. I don't like stupid general comments but I would make an exception here and say that you don't like Dream Theater if you don't like this song.\n\nIn the end, the only reason why this record isn't my favourite one of the band and only placed second behind the previous \"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\" is that there are maybe one or two ballads too much on the record with \"This Is The Life\" and \"Far From Heaven\" and that the band doesn't try out something completely new yet. But I feel that the best is yet to come and that this album will also still grow on me. This album is definitely in my top ten of the best metal releases of the year and a must have for any fan of progressive music of any kind.\n",
        "\nIts been a busy couple of months for Roadrunner Records. So far they've had Trivium's In Waves, the new Kids In Glass Houses, Opeth's Heritage and to come is the new Mastodon and Machine Head records. In the middle of all of this metal madness though, the irrepressible Dream Theater return with their 13th studio album, A Dramatic Turn Of Events.\n\nNever could there be a more suitable title for the album. Dream Theater have cycled musicians a few times in their 25 year career but no one, least of all the band could have expected founding member, drummer and all round band leader Mike Portnoy to leave them last year in the most turbulent of circumstances. It came as a shock to the metal world as Portnoy had always been considered the lynchpin in DT, dealing with most of the writing, the organisation, production and publicity for the band.\n\nAs a brief guide, from what I've read from both sides, Portnoy wanted the band to take a break for a few years as he felt that the relationships in the band had become fractured. He wanted to take time off to reinvigorate the band by going off and doing their own things for a while then coming back with a monster album. The band didn't feel the same, they all wanted to continue the momentum they had started since they signed with Roadrunner and their two widest received albums, Systematic Chaos and Black Clouds & Silver Linings. As a result of this, Portnoy announced he was leaving the band as they couldn't come to a mutual agreement and he was committed with side projects, including touring with Avenged Sevenfold.\n\nThis left the band in a quandary. They wanted to continue but replacing a drummer that is considered one of the world's greatest would be no mean feat. Cue months of deliberation and a 3 day set of auditions featuring some of the world's greatest metal and rock drummers. They filmed it all for the documentary The Spirit Carries On (search for it on YouTube). I'll break the suspense and let you know that they decided on the insanely good Mike Mangini, formerly of Annihilator and Steve Vai. Watch his audition, its rather epic.\n\nNow, fast forward to today and DT have released the first album with Mangini and their first without any input from Portnoy. I've gotta say, I was expecting it to be missing something, but it certainly sounds like the Dream Theater I love. Or rather, should I say loved, as it sounds very much like classic Dream Theater. Where Mike Portnoy used to force the music to evolve and sound slightly different between albums, this album feels more akin to the likes of Images & Words, which is by no means a bad thing, but it shows off how the band have obviously been wanting to write for years.\n\nThis is the first album where the whole band had creative freedom. Previously, the vast majority of the writing had been handled by Portnoy and guitarist John Petrucci, with some writing in the last few years including keyboardist Jordan Rudess. On this album, bass player John Myung and singer James LaBrie took an active role and they, for the first time, wrote the album as a band. And you can hear it in the songs, there is lots of stuff going on. \n\nThe keyboards are a lot more in your face on this album, Lost Not Forgotten has the kind of epic keyboard solo that would make a guitarist weep. You can hear a lot of incidental keyboard work behind the bigger guitar riffs. If you ever watch a video of DT playing live, there are lots of times where Rudess is playing something under a major guitar riff and he is mixed so low that you can't hear anything he is playing. The keyboards are more pronounced and constant.\n\nEach song manages to be more grand than the last. Opening song On The Backs Of Angels sets the bar pretty high but as it moves to Build Me Up, Break Me Down then into Lost Not Forgotten it just seems to get bigger and bigger sounding. But then the classic DT ballad This Is The Life (which sounds suspiciously like The Spirit Carries On in places) brings you back down to earth with some lovely guitar work, subtle vocals and some light drum work.\n\nSpeaking of drum work, Mangini has stepped into Portnoy's sizeable shoes very nicely. I can't imagine the amount of pressure thats being piled on him, replacing one of the best loved drummers in metal, but he manages it with aplomb. He can do the mental time signatures, the insane double kick work and then bring it back down nicely for the ballads and play something tasteful. I was worried that they would end up hiring someone who was all flash and no substance, who could play the old stuff but not write anything new. I'm glad to report that he can do it and he can do it pretty damn well.\n\nJohn Petrucci has brought his A-game to this album. He's taken the reigns of the band as a spokesperson and a writer as well as handling production duties. The album sounds great. The mix is less clinical than previous efforts, feels warmer and more like a live band. While there are still moments where the change from loud to quiet is very sudden, it sounds more natural, rather than say, cutting the end of the loud bit off in Pro-tools and pasting the quiet bit in immediately afterwards. The songs and arrangements seem to flow better. I don't know if that is down to Petrucci's influence as a producer or the band writing together for the first time, but I like it.\n\nLets not forget Petrucci's main job though; guitar hero. My oh my, there are some tasty riffs and shred-tastic solos happening here. The opening riff for Bridges In The Sky sounds enormous. Its also nice to see him break out the 7 string guitars again after they were hardly used over the last two albums.\n\nJohn Myung proves on this album why he is one of the most underrated bass players in the world. His work melding in with the keyboards and guitars is truly amazing. He manages to find a perfect place to sit between the keys and guitars and navigates the madness in some places with the skills of a truly brilliant bass player. The standout song for me on the bass would have to be On The Backs Of Angels. You can hear he is there, you can hear him balance the mix and you can hear that he will clearly not get bored of playing the song. Myung gets overlooked as a bass player far too often, he is one of the world's greatest. And if you needed further proof, his little bass solos in Outcry are just baffling. How someone can play a neck that big, with strings that thick like that is mind boggling.\n\nI've always had a love hate relationship with James LaBrie's vocals. On some songs he can sound amazing, in some he can sound very weak and not suitable at all for the band. On this album, he's never sounded better. I think its down to the fact that he's had a more active role in writing this time and he can tailor the lines to suit him without stepping on people's creative toes. Bridges In The Sky, Lost Not Forgotten and Outcry show him at his absolute best. Mixing soft singing with epic power choruses, he does exactly what he needs for the songs and in some cases exceeds my previous expectations of what he can do.\n\nThere's plenty of extra stuff jammed into the songs that have been hinted at before but never really implemented. Besides the obvious keyboard stuff, there's lots of little samples and electronic noises punctuating some of the intros and quieter sections of the songs. There's choirs, throat singing (no, really, listen to Bridges In The Sky), static, noise and even the much lamented keyboard patch: Orchestra Hits.\n\nDream Theater sound comfortable with themselves for the first time since Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence. This album should keep all fans of DT happy. It sounds classic enough to satisfy those who want another Images & Words and it sounds new enough to satisfy the audience they've gained since they went to Roadrunner. I don't think its the best album they've ever done, but musically, lyrically and production wise, they've hit the ground running on this new chapter of DT. I was worried that without Portnoy they wouldn't be able to come out with anything matching their previous quality seeing as he was such a major driving force behind them. I'm happy to say that they've surpassed my expectations and come out with an album that raises the bar for quality significantly.\n\nThey'll never write another Images & Words, but its nice to know that after nearly 30 years as a band they can weather a drastic change and still put out something this good.\n",
        "\nWhen the departure of Mike Portnoy surfaced a year ago, the level of panic and outcry was astonishing. How could Dream Theater possibly continue to exist with one of its three founding members gone? Portnoy had been the most driving force behind the band on their most recent albums, so what direction would they be able to take? Could they continue to write good music?\n\nI, for one, was not concerned, as I had long since begun to find Portnoy's disproportionate influence over the band's songwriting to be troublesome. Although, I greatly enjoyed Black Clouds & Silver Linings and decided that both Systematic Chaos and Octavarium had their moments that made them worthwhile, Dream Theater's music was becoming stale. I welcomed Portnoy's departure because so long as the band stayed together, it meant one thing for certain: change.\n\nSo, when I unwrapped A Dramatic Turn of Events a few days ago and heard the first notes ring through my headphones, it was with an open mind that I did so. I began listening on the premise that I knew this album had to be different. I understood that Dream Theater was going to do some things they hadn't done before, and I was okay with that. The album did not disappoint. I made a point to listen to it several times through before writing a review. I felt overwhelmed after my first time listening through the album. There's a lot going on and there's a lot to digest. \n\nPreviews of the album I read elsewhere criticized the album as not having any standout tracks, and after my first listen, I felt that this seemed an accurate statement. However, my opinion changed on subsequent listens. It's not that there are no standout songs. It's that they're all of good quality. It can be said immediately that the opener, On the Backs of Angels is outstanding and is absolutely a contender for the best song on the album. But what about the rest of it?\n\nWell, Dream Theater gives us an interesting prospect on this album: four of the songs are over ten minutes in length. Four epics? Yes. Lost Not Forgotten, Bridges in the Sky, Outcry, and Breaking All Illusions all qualify as epics based on their length. The question is whether or not they truly live up to that name. In my opinion, three of them do.\n\nLost Not Forgotten gets my approval as my favorite song on the album. It's an odd one, to be sure. Jordan Rudess had promised in interviews that this album would have more piano on it, and Lost Not Forgotten opens with a piano solo. And might I add, it's very well executed and tastefully done. Dream Theater then puts on a grand legato introductory section before getting into the riffs, which are simple given their history, but effective. What really gets my attention, however, is the section beginning around 4:25, which is strongly reminiscent of Images and Words, Awake, and Scenes from a Memory. The riff work and the melodic interludes remind me of Metropolis Pt.1 and some passages from Pt.2. Again, the memories surface at 6:22, with heavy influence from Rudess. The solo section lasting from 7:10 to 9:00 is perhaps my favorite passage by Dream Theater in over a decade, even giving me fond memories of the widely-panned Falling Into Infinity (which I liked).\n\nBridges in the Sky has the album's heaviest riff work and the album's most memorable chorus. Plus, I like to think of it as the album's pseudo-title-track. This track is also filled with homages to the band's excellent past work, featuring an extended solo section that similar to the closing section of Home from Scenes from a Memory. Breaking All Illusions, in a similar vein, harkens back to Dream Theater's earlier days when their sound was characterized by being both heavy and light at the same time. The opening riff to Breaking All Illusions makes it perfectly clear where the track is headed - down memory lane, and in a good way.\n\nBut no, the album is not all wonderful. Outcry is a disappointing track, mostly because it doesn't feel like it ever goes anywhere. It's just long and doesn't have any major shifts in tone or tempo. Also, it contains the album's most egregious offense: the electronica/hip-hop/rap-style synthesizer beats. Outcry, along with the album's \"radio single\" Build Me Up, Break Me Down, contains awful, AWFUL sections of synth work which sound like they belong on MTV or VH1 and are absolutely guaranteed to offend fans of heavy metal everywhere. This was by far the biggest shock to me on my initial run through the album. After the overwhelming awesome that was On the Backs of Angels, the very next thing your ears hear is an introductory section that sounds like it was written by Slipknot perhaps thirteen years ago. It's a shame, because otherwise, there isn't anything that's necessarily terrible about either song. They just aren't very good. Additionally, I'll give it to Dream Theater that Build Me Up, Break Me Down is a long shot better than some of their previous attempts at radio-friendly songs, such as Forsaken and The Answer Lies Within. \n\nAnd lastly, the album's mellow side. This Is the Life, Far From Heaven, and Beneath the Surface are all ballads. This Is the Life is the one most likely to please the fans, as it's very much in the vein of some of the band's previous smoother songs. Far From Heaven and Beneath the Surface, however, feature something we haven't seen from Dream Theater in over a decade: primary focus on James LaBrie's vocals. Not since Scenes From a Memory have we seen Dream Theater make songs like this. They aren't metal at all, so if you're looking for riffs in these songs you may as well give up. What's important is the emotion in LaBrie's voice and the quality of the lyrics. I can assure you that both outstanding and upon hearing them the first time I was on the verge of tears.\n\nSo the production? The quality of performance? Nothing less than top-notch from everyone involved, even Mike Mangini. I don't think there's anyone who can legitimately knock Mangini for his technical prowess. He is in no way lacking in that department. The big unanswered question is whether or not he's going to be a major contributing force like Portnoy was. We don't know yet. He didn't write anything for the album; he merely played his parts. What can be said without question, however, is that he plays them very well. The other members of the band are obviously at the peak of their game as they have been for some time now, but notably more present on this album are Jordan Rudess and James LaBrie, who have parts that stand out significantly more noticeably than in many years (and those parts are good).\n\nThe verdict: this album is great. It is not an instant classic or even among the best in Dream Theater's catalog, but it's well-executed and easily on par with their previous release, Black Clouds & Silver Linings. The key is the album's different direction. I love it and look forward to hearing Dream Theater release more new material with this lineup in the future. Until then, we'll see how well it's received.\n",
        "\nDespite perhaps the aptness of this album\u2019s title, \u2018A Dramatic Turn of Events\u2019 fails to have anything particularly dramatic about it. Looking past the whole mild insanity surrounding its birth, what we have here is a strong, solid progressive metal album that is both entertaining and somewhat lacking.\n\nIt\u2019s an unfortunate situation we have in the progressive metal scene where many bands attempt to emulate the genre leaders rather than trying to progress musically. It\u2019s a creeping disease that is strangling the innovation that should be inherent in the genre, this desire to follow the leader. Dream Theater is undoubtedly one of the best examples of a genre leader when it comes to prog metal and are also, subsequently, one of the most copied. And it seems here, on their first post-Portnoy release, they\u2019ve decided, rather than to truly innovate, they will stick to a tried and tested sound. And while this may be commonplace and even accepted in other genres, in prog it can be absolutely fatal.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, really. With a new drummer brought in, Dream Theater was in an unenviable position with their new record. Literally nothing they could do would not be scrutinized to a horrible degree by the common and overly-obsessive fans alike. If they had moved their sound on too much, Mangini would be accused of \u2018ruining\u2019 the band, and if they hadn\u2019t changed at all, they would have been accused of playing it safe. As much as I wish to say they\u2019ve found a comfortable middle ground, they haven\u2019t, with their new release falling dangerously close to the \u2018playing it safe\u2019 line.\n\nIn terms of talent, they are on top form. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. They always are. They don\u2019t get any points for this because this should be a given by now. Okay, Mangini might get a pass on this as he had to prove himself to be a suitable replace for Portnoy, and he did. He\u2019s competent, though he fails to add any real flair to the songs which will hopefully change in the future if he is allowed some say in the songwriting. The songs are where they need to exceed themselves, though. And this is where they, unfortunately, fall flat. Let me get this straight, none of this release is bad. I like the album and the songs are all listenable. \n\nBut it also saddens me because most of the songs fail to capture the spark that make the great Dream Theater moments so great. Most of them fade into one another in some strange, proggy haze. They certainly sound differently enough, but few stand out as anything even approaching a classic. In effect, none are bad, but none rise above being simply \u2018good\u2019 as well. There are some stand out songs here, definitely. \u2018On The Backs of Angels\u2019 and \u2018Lost Not Forgotten\u2019 in particular are genuinely fantastic and may even rival some of Dream Theater\u2019s best works, but the rest of the album fails to strike the right chord. There are the usual behemoths and a large number of softer songs as the band has stepped away from the \u2018heaviness\u2019 that was generally a main criticism for some previous releases, most obviously \u2018Train of Thought.\u2019 This is a prog album through and through, and while this should be wonderful news, the end product is a bit disappointing. \n\nIt\u2019s decent. That\u2019s perhaps the synopsis of this review, the main gist of it. Listenable, fair, alright. It isn\u2019t bad, but that\u2019s not enough for a Dream Theater release, especially given the general quality of their back catalog.\n",
        "\nCataclysmic changes, for better or worse, create the greatest possibilities for the future. New York quintet Dream Theater, the biggest progressive metal band in the world, was affected by such cataclysmic change in September 2010: founding member and drumming extraordinaire Mike Portnoy, stuck between continuing on against his heart or letting the band proceed without him, chose the latter. The media fallout before and after the selection of Berklee percussion instructor and world\u2019s fastest drummer Mike Mangini has been threatening, and it only intensified before and even after the September 13, 2011 release of A Dramatic Turn of Events. Progressive metal has never seen such sensational news, and the effect it has on the actual music is worthy of intense examination. Fortunately, despite the dramatic turn of events in the media, A Dramatic Turn of Events itself almost entirely reflects the drama\u2019s positive results.\n\nThe two ways Dream Theater has changed in 2011 are the drummer\u2019s chair and the effect this has on the band dynamic. Replacing Portnoy in Dream Theater was as equally impossible as \u201creplacing\u201d Bob Barker on The Price is Right. Mike Mangini may carry the same first name, but his performing style (at least for now) is less lead drumming and more assisting the various melodic structures of the song, of which there are often multiple. Album opener On the Backs of Angels allows Mangini to enter with tasteful octobans against an eerie keyboard/guitar combination, and then grows into a balanced progressive number with every member contributing their own melodic ideas; Mangini\u2019s stylistic contributions tweak the basic beat while maintaining the groove, unlike the fill-heavy Portnoy.\n\nTrack five Bridges In The Sky is a relentless riffmeister once the music proper kicks in, sporting one of the most creative main riffs this year, aggressive vocals from James LaBrie, and Mangini playing with assertive power, that little extra beat and the tendency to augment or truncate a measure for increased impact. Just after ten minutes is a spectacular drop onto John Petrucci\u2019s seventh string, with the keyboard flourishes so prominent they feel alive (this moment has to be heard); Mangini moves from tom battering into faster double bass runs, eventually finishing the song proper with a lightning-fast fill that gives the impression the man has four arms. Moments like this display Mangini\u2019s true potential, yet to be fully unleashed until the next album; Petrucci wrote the drum skeleton for Mangini to elaborate on, and though this compositional choice decreases the importance of the drums, the rest of Dream Theater was able to write their parts around each other and cohere optimally.\n\nMike Portnoy, as the de facto band leader, has been undeniably associated with the ostentatious, derivative metallic tendencies of Dream Theater that emerged after 2002\u2019s Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, displayed most vividly on 2009\u2019s Black Clouds & Silver Linings. Somebody had to usurp the band\u2019s direction to avoid the burnout that inspired Portnoy\u2019s exit. A Dramatic Turn of Events is a direct channel to a more melodic past, but rather than copying the style of these albums, Dream Theater infuses this album with a lush atmosphere while maintaining their own established identity and excellent coherence between the nine tracks that comprise it. The member most responsible for the album\u2019s unique aesthetic is keyboardist Jordan Rudess; despite every member putting most of their cards on the table, he stands out the most, expanding the use of keyboards across the album and hiding them in just the right places. Critics of Rudess\u2019 excessive keyboard unisons have precious little ground left, as the keys are more orchestral than anything ever used before and add an extra layer without getting in the way of any songwriting. Dramatic and surging when the music is aggressive, or contemplative but still prominent when the music slows down, Rudess is a vital ingredient of ADToE.\n\nThe remaining three band members are also free to explore more melodic territory, creating a nearly perfect balance between complex/simple, heavy/mellow and light/shade. Vocalist James LaBrie, with more exclusive control of the melodies, has strengthened his melodic qualities and remedied the tendency for his rougher vocals to sound out of place; how he sings the lyrical content, and what it is, overall reflect the album\u2019s theme of opposition and change more realistically. Bridges In The Sky is chorus heaven, with a remarkable timbral contrast between heavy and soaring that carries the lyrical story of religious awakening. The modern metal attack of Build Me Up, Break Me Down is one of the smartest radio-friendly songs of the year, not for the sake of commercial relevance but integrating it into the dichotomous album theme. Digitally processed verses and sludgy riffs lead directly into an irresistible chorus, the second half of which features LaBrie backing the main melody with faint yells at higher frequency than has ever been done in studio; the lyrics criticize the popular habit of alternately deifying and demonizing celebrities based on their \u201cerratic behavior\u201d in personal lives. Ballads balance the album\u2019s weight, and though they number three out of nine songs, their total duration is an unobtrusive 16:19 out of 77:05; they are optimally placed on the journey and highlight LaBrie\u2019s exceptional control of melody. Drum and bassless ballads Far From Heaven and album closer Beneath the Surface are among the finest songs of this type to appear for some time, led by sorrowful strings, plaintive vocals and, on the latter, an acoustic chord progression that sounds as equally heartbroken yet resigned as the tragic words.\n\nJohn Petrucci is more diverse and restrained in his guitar playing, with less emphasis on lead guitar and even less on super-technical excursions; these moments are the weakest parts of A Dramatic Turn of Events when they arise, as on the somewhat incohesive Lost Not Forgotten that loses itself somewhat in awkward transitions and slightly bland instrumental excursions and unisons. His slower playing is creative and as distinctly Petrucci as always, standing out on the chief ballad This is the Life and excellent Breaking All Illusions, both brought towards evocative symphonic climaxes by guitar solos. Overall, the album is less guitar-centric not simply because the instrument is less prominent, but because the other parts are more distinct.\n\nBassist John Myung was often reduced to doubling other instruments in recent DT years and distorted such that the bass becomes less distinct; the bass tone is now clean, higher in the mix and embellishes the songs with counterpoints or solos. The frequent dynamic changes of Outcry, about the North African revolutions, see Myung switch from doubling a crushing riff or driving groove to a bass solo accented by Mangini\u2019s drum pawnshop and a distinct melody underneath a sweep-picking guitar solo. He even offers lyrics on longest track Breaking All Illusions, joyfully melodic and almost jazzy in its interplay between dark bass shading and strange guitar/keyboard tapping combinations. The crystal-clear, non-brickwalled production by Andy Wallace captures each of the members in their element, framing the band dynamic and sumptuously layered sound in exquisite detail.\n\nA Dramatic Turn of Events represents a rejuvenation for a band that could have easily disappeared instead, having had existed since 1985. In an ironic twist, losing their leader has brought the four other members of Dream Theater closer together; time will tell how perfectly the newcomer fits in, but Mangini delivers a promising showing. This album shows the strength of the cohesion between Petrucci, Rudess, LaBrie and Myung, with only a few glitches related to the lengthy instrumental excursions in some of the tracks that number over ten minutes. This is a testament to the New Yorkers\u2019 strength in proceeding through dark times, and a bright portrait of their future. For now, the grade is stellar, but yet more silver linings may lurk on the horizon.\n\n(From Sputnikmusic as usual.)\n",
        "\nAngels are often misunderstood when subject to modern interpretation, too often seen simply as a more forbidding version of a pixie or sylph, conveniently rendered in a Greek/Roman toga when not presented bare skinned. But this is not the biblical definition, though a human-like manifestation might be presupposed given their interaction with people in scriptural accounts. The biblical angel is merely a messenger, an emissary of supernatural consequence that usually brings about a world-changing message by either word of force. And either on purpose or by freak accident, Dream Theater managed to wander almost exclusively into the less commonly alluded nature of said heavenly creature.\n\nWhile hardly the most awe inspiring or outright brilliant thing put forth by this long time New York progressive outfit, \"On The Backs Of Angels\" has all of the right ingredients to bridge the gap between newer and older fans. The bleak, politically charged lyrics are definitely a boon for anyone whose gotten into the band since \"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\", while the rest of what is going on hearkens back to the early 90s. In fact, while probably not too far off from a number of individual songs that have restated the \"Images And Words\" template of flashy, virtuosic solos and consonant, melodic themes with the usual rhythmic twists, this song could be chalked up to a poor man's \"Pull Me Under\". The one thing separating this from the majesty of said song is LaBrie's voice, which has lost a fair amount of its range and punch and sounds all but interchangeable with a few lesser voices that have emulated this band's style for the past 2 decades.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, often the sum is more than the parts when it comes to truly great bands, and the absence of Mike Portnoy goes virtually unnoticed. Part of it may lay in my personal bias in favor of guitars and keyboards, as well as Petrucci and Rudess in particular, but even when dealing with a complex style such as this, there is much to be said for keeping the beat and not getting carried away, and Mike Mangini displays good care in picking where he puts his fills on here. This is a song built mostly off of a steady groove that evolves gradually into a climactic cascade of ideas, and apart from the auspicious piano solo about 6 minutes in and a few fluid synthesizer motives coming and going, this comes off as a mostly straightforward affair, albeit one that lasts for almost 9 minutes.\n\nOne can't help at reflect at the seeming misnomer that progressive rock/metal has become since its inception, as many of the tricks thrown out here are very tried and true. The best way to think of it is that the term has a certain relativity to it depending upon which time period the music draws its greatest influence. At one time, Rush's \"2112\" was a dangerous new album that broke most of the conventions of rock music, though today this album is referenced by bands including Dream Theater to the point cliche. By the same token, Death's \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and Emperor's \"In The Nightside Eclipse\" were of a similar newness in character, yet carried little (if any) resemblance to the original notion of progressive music as it was heard in the 70s. But whatever sound one most often associates with the term, Dream Theater have brought a consistency to their brand that is on full display here.\n",
        "\nEveryone by now knows the drama surrounding this album, so I will attempt to avoid mentioning it, however I will say that on \"A Dramatic Turn of Events\" the band does sound more invigorated and energetic then they did on the last few. Sure, most of the reason for this is likely going to be attributed to the loss of Portnoy and the entrance of Mangini, but it's hard to be 100% sure.\n\nADTOE (as I will call it from here on) is definitely an attempt at returning to the band's roots. Now of course seeing as I am a huge fan of the band's first 3 albums I have no problem with this, and after hearing \"On the Backs of Angels\" I was convinced all us Dream Theater fans were in for something good. The song is very \"Pull Me Under\"-like in structure, but has enough changes and melodic differences (not to mention more of an actual guitar solo, and a good one at that) to keep it interesting and not a rip off. All in all, a great way to begin the album.\n\nHowever, from here on out the album is a little bit more hit and miss. \"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\" is definitely going to cause some controversy due to its odd electronic elements and a generally modern, almost commercial feel. But despite that, I still like the song fair enough. There's some really cool Rudess keyboards in the later part, and it's got a very catchy chorus (which the majority of DT's catalog has struggled with after Moore left). \n\nSo that one's a BIT of a \"hit\" so to say but not a complete success. The album begins to get more muddled and flawed during the middle portion of it. The biggest offender is \"Lost Not Forgotten\" which is a complete rip off of \"Under a Glass Moon\" and I'm amazed so few people have mentioned it. Sure, the vocal melodies are very different and the riffs aren't exactly the same, but the structure pretty much is. The only real difference here is they extend each section more than they need to and they added a little keyboard intro to try and fool us. The fact of the matter is it's got the same octave guitar intro, a very similar main beat, the \"chug-chug\" mid-paced riff in the 1st verse, and the chorus has the same rhythm AND break section as in \"Under a Glass Moon\"! And that's just scratching the surface as the solo is quite similar, and they even include the odd time break in the middle! It's a real shame that they chose to do this to a song that really defines the greatness of the band in that era, and seems as though they needed an extra song on the album so they tried to go with a \"winning formula\" and rip off one of their most famous songs.\n\nThankfully, the album improves after that. \"This is the Life\" is a solid ballad I think, with some great ethereal keyboard work and another chorus that's guaranteed to stick in your head whether you like it or not. The solo is also my 2nd favorite Petrucci solo on this album. Granted, it's a little over- saccharine but it still works as a whole.\n\nAs you probably noticed by looking at the track listing, we have three 10+ minute long songs pretty close together and, you guessed it, they are pretty hit and miss. Sure, they aren't as boring as \"Far From Heaven\" or \"Beneath the Surface\" which, despite some good moments, just drag on too much, but some of these epics just don't cut it.\n\nThe ones that don't are \"Bridges in the Sky\", and \"Outcry\". There's actually a lot of good moments in these songs including some much more prominent John Myung bass playing (he even gets a pretty cool solo in the former) and Mangini's stand out performances in both, but the songs themselves simply drag on too much. The vocal parts are very boring and the riffs don't really stand out that much. I do like how the instrumental section in \"Outcry\" builds though. It's really clever some of the stuff they're doing there, almost feeling like a deranged circus which is always a positive.\n\nThe best song on the album though is the third epic \"Breaking All Illusions\". THIS is the Dream Theater I know and love and it's great to finally hear them sounding like this for the first time in what seems like forever. These guys made such an impact on me back in the day, hearing this song makes me feel rather nostalgic and hopeful for the future. It's obviously intended to be the \"Learning to Live\" of this album (though the execution is more like something off of \"Awake\"), but unlike the direct rip off we heard earlier, this actually works as a tribute to their past. It's got some very Keith Emerson type keyboard work in there, which bounces around and leaves a melodic path for the other instruments to follow. James actually manages to pull out some very good vocals here (which he has struggled with on this album), along with the best chorus this band has done since \"Trial of Tears\". Kevin Moore would be proud. Oh, and it's got John Petrucci's best solo on this album. It's divided into sections and really builds and goes somewhere culminating in some great fiery picking sections.\n\nSo yeah, this album isn't quite as much of a return to roots as I had hoped, but it's still closer than anything we've heard from these guys in awhile. The problem is there's not enough creativity going on here and the energy just isn't happening like it used to (except for BAI). Still, there's some great songs here and if they choose to pursue this sound a bit more we might FINALLY get another very good/great album from them, which hasn't really happened since \"Awake\".\n",
        "\nDream Theater is back, this time without their superhuman percussionist and driving force Mike Portnoy. The band had reached a very interesting phase in their careers after the break up and had to prove that the band had a future without Portnoy. But then the single came out and proved quite a lot that the band is not quite affected by Portnoy\u2019s departure. Filling Portnoy\u2019s void as a songwriter was also equally important. Amazingly, all the members take up the responsibility, and we see songwriting contributions from every member. Dream Theater cut down much of their song lengths and makes the album compact like their old Images And Words days. \n\nTechnically, guitar monster John Petrucci and keyboard wizard Jordan Rudess are in top form in the album. The riff and lead work of Petrucci is amazing as usual. Rudess does an excellent job with the keys. His solos are effective and are in phase with Petrucci\u2019s lead work effectively. James LaBrie\u2019s vocal work shows some improvement especially in the use of raspy vocals. Come on folks let us face it, we are not in any case, going to get back the same voice that sang Metropolis Part I, but here it is at least professional and listenable. So let us speak about the major change in the album, the percussionist Mike Mangini. On technical level he is a competent drummer and a good replacement for Portnoy. His drumming style matches that of Portnoy\u2019s and that is something to be expected. Despite the change, John Myung\u2019s talent with the bass is underused, though he contributes heavily in the songwrititng. The production is good as expected. \n\nThe album is basically what you normally would expect from Dream Theater, with long songs, extended instrumental sections consisting of excessive, twisted jamming. The basic Dream Theater formula remains the same, except that the songs, this time are more catchy, having more emphasis on the choruses. I might go on to add that this might be their catchiest album. But did I say that it is bad? Well, not at all. The structure of the songs is similar to Threshold Hypothetical with less emphasis and more on instrumental sections. Among the highlights are the opener On the Backs of Angels which comes out as a less catchy Pull Me Under, no wonder it was released as the single. Lost Not Forgotten stands out as the second best song in the album. From its effective piano solo, to the insane soloing, sheer pace, catchy chorus and wonderful lyrics, this track is just awesome, and all the above elements just work together excellently. Outcry and Breaking All Illusions are more complex but work equally well. Breaking All Illusions especially has a superb flow between the soft and heavy parts and works as the best track from the album reminding of the good old days of Images And Words. Far From Heaven and Beneath The Surface are great ballads. Beneath The Surface could have been even better had it been darker much more in the vein of Space Dye Vest. Among the weaker tracks, Built Me Up, Break Me Down has a superb chorus, but sucks during the verses. Bridges In The Sky sucks in the chorus, and is overlong. This Is The Life is a fluffy ballad and is nothing more than a filler.\n\nThis album is a stellar addition to the Dream Theater catalogue. Though not hundred percent consistent, the positives immensely outshine the negatives. The weaker tracks present are thankfully listenable and not total abominations. Due to its catchiness this album can appeal to non Dream Theater fans easily. This album is highly recommended for all fans of progressive music and those all who wish to discover Dream Theater. Though not the greatest this outfit has to offer, it still is an album much more worth its price.\n",
        "\nAs many know, this is the first ever recorded output that Dream Theater has put out without founding drummer Mike Portnoy. That story has been covered ad nauseum by various outlets, so I won\u2019t go into any further detail here.\n\nThe question that most people will have about this album is about the drumming of newcomer Mike Mangini. It does the job. However, the music was written before Mangini joined the band; thus seems that the music was written for Portnoy\u2019s drumming style in mind. Mangini seems to play what was already written for him without really developing a style of his own on this album. Keep in mind, though, that to be able to play Portnoy\u2019s parts, it does show that Mike Mangini is a great drummer, and that DOES show on this album\u2014for the most part. One thing to remember is that there are two ballads that don\u2019t feature drums at all, \u201cFar From Heaven\u201d and \u201cBeneath The Surface\u201d\n\nWe all know, though, that the most important reason for reading any review of any album is the review of the music contained therein, and said music is the best collection of pure songs that Dream Theater has written since \u201cImages & Words\u201d. The music is catchy, the riffs are great, and the vocal melodies are very well-done. One new influence does creep its way into the music a little bit, and that is electronic music. There are some blips and electronic drums in the beginnings of some songs. This is NOT to say that this is an industrial album. Further, there are also plenty of parts that are very orchestral in their nature, with loads of bombastic strings, as well as some weird chanting (if you can call it that\u2014it almost sounds like burping) at the beginning and end of \u201cBridges In The Sky\u201d.\n\nThere are a bunch of highlights on the album, including first single \"On The Backs Of Angels\", the Evergrey-style riffing of \"Lost Not Forgotten\", the floating balladry of \"This Is The Life\", and the downtuned-guitar heaviness and the organ-style keyboard solo of \"Bridges In The Sky\". Every song on this album is truly fantastic. On the whole, the album hearkens back to Images & Words without sounding like that album. This album and its collection of songs is its own beast.\n\nOf course, what\u2019s a Dream Theater album without instrumental and compositional wanking? There\u2019s plenty of that to be had in this album: lots of odd time signatures and trading solos. What\u2019s important, though, is that none of this gets in the way of the SONGS. \n\nAll in all, this album is a great return to form for the band. It\u2019s not as good as \u201cImages & Words\u201d, but it\u2019s still an excellent album that stands to become a classic Dream Theater album.\n",
        "\nWell, isn't that an apt album title. \n\nAfter Mike Portnoy left, there was intense speculation and worry over Dream Theater's future direction. Myself, I welcomed the news. Yes, Portnoy was a good drummer, even a great one, but he was one pompous asshole, dictating the other band members over what to do (just watch the Chaos in Progress documentary where he tries telling James LaBrie how to sing - James looks really pissed off), insisting on *ahem* \"singing\", and pushing them in questionable directions. So, I welcomed the news, and when it came out that Mike Mangini was his replacement, I only got more excited. Does this album live up to my lofty expectations? Mostly, yes. \n\nWhat does this album sound like? Dream Theater. There's none of the games of \"Hey, let's pretend we're Opeth!\" or \"Hey, let's pretend we're Muse!\" that Portnoy liked to play when he was in the band, things which massively dragged down their last three albums. The only song that falls prey to this is \"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\", with a chugging seven-string riff and vocal distortion recalling Train of Thought, combined with a weird electronic, programmed flavour in the verses. Is it any surprise that this is the weakest track on the album?\n\nThe main flavour here is of Dream Theater's lighter side, similar to Falling Into Infinity or Octavarium, but with a heavier style that keeps it from getting as sappy or mainstream-pandering as either of those albums. Even the epics have a huge catchy chorus and a lot of melodic elements, which helps to leaven the tension and keep them focused. Similarly, instead of trying to look \"modern\", Dream Theater looks back to its past. \"On the Backs of Angels\" deliberately recalls \"Pull Me Under\", with the opening clean riff joined by keyboards and tom-heavy drumming, before exploding into an excellent prog-metal tune. And, wait, what's this? Audible bass, and a solo section that isn't just Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci wanking all over their instruments for 5 minutes? I can dig it! A strong opener, to be sure. There are quite a few moments on this album that recall Dream Theater's past - aside from this and the aforementioned \"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\", there's the Octavarium-styled \"This is the Life\", and \"Outcry\" and \"Breaking All Illusions\", two grandiose epics that could have fit in well anywhere. \n\nThe difference with this album is mostly in the keyboard work. Jordan Rudess never really got display his full talents when Portnoy was in the band - he was mostly limited to the aforementioned wank solos, barely audible background chords, and his main strength on those albums, piano. Here, his atmospheric keyboards get more of a workout, displaying a symphonic and choral approach that he never really used before. The choral progression at the beginning of \"Outcry\" is as grandiose as anything on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, the strings in the chorus of \"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\" lift it from being mundane to soaring, and the flute-like solos in \"Breaking All Illusions\" are really quite unique. He still has a natural propensity towards goofiness, though - \"Bridges in the Sky\", an otherwise decent rocker, is almost ruined by the unnecessary throat-singing and Gregorian chant at the beginning. \n\nThis compliments John Petrucci's guitar perfectly - trading the overly distorted tone he's had since 2003 for one that is crunchy yet clear helps a lot, as does reining in his solos and playing more subtle riffs. He can still shred like nothing else, though - \"Breaking All Illusions\" makes sure to remind us of that. The two soloing titans of the band backing off a bit allows John Myung to breathe more, and while his bass tone is a little muddy, he's rock-solid throughout. As for James LaBrie, he's mediocre. He displays a fuller range, such as the backing screams on \"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\" and the emotional croon on \"Beneath the Surface\", but his voice has become increasingly flat and limited in range, with little of the unique high tenor belting that made him distinguished on Images and Words. Yes, he's pushing 50, but Bruce Dickinson's past 50 and he can still belt it out live. Still, at least he doesn't sound like Dave Mustaine on the heavy songs any more. \n\nSo, how does Mangini fare replacing Portnoy? Well... meh. Truth be told, he doesn't do too much special here, mostly keeping the beat and playing along to John Petrucci's programmed drum demos. He certainly puts in a competent performance, highlights being the speedy fills in \"On the Backs of Angels\" and the double bass hammering of \"Outcry\", but we all know he can do better. \n\nThe other main problem is the preponderence of ballads - three of them from a nine-track album. I do like Dream Theater's ballads, as they generally display somewhat more emotion in their lyrics and delivery than their heavy tunes, but here, they miss the mark. \"This is the Life\" slips right through my head without making an impression, with uninspired piano work and the phony passion of John Petrucci's solos dueling over Mike Mangini's bland drumbeat (is it any wonder he decided to sit the other two out?). The other two ballads, \"Far from Heaven\" and \"Beneath the Surface\", have exemplary performances on piano and acoustic guitar respectively, but Rudess smothers them both with sappy string arrangements. Actually, these songs are symptomatic of something that plagues the album - by setting out to reassure fans anxious of Mike Portnoy's departure that they're still the same band, they've pulled their horns in a bit, and haven't done anything that's truly new. \n\nBut aside from that, this is pretty good... actually, it might well be Dream Theater's best since Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. If they utilise Mangini's talents further and build on the symphonic elements found here, while eliminating the sappy ballads, they could truly make a masterpiece once again. \n\nReccommended songs: \"On the Backs of Angels\", \"Outcry\", \"Breaking All Illusions\", \"Far from Heaven\"\n",
        "\nAdmittedly, I'm a big Dream Theater fan, and any release they're going to have is going to make big news in the metal world, no matter what. I was quite curious how the band would sound without the shackles of Mike Portnoy controlling them while he's off making... fucking nu-rock with Russell Allen. What?\n\nAnyway, the band overall really doesn't sound much different. In fact, on this new one, they hearken back to their \"Awake\" and \"Images and Words\" days with a lot more rock tendencies than metal. There is still plenty of metal to be had, but many songs reek of... as much as it pains me to say it, blandness. Just listen to the opener, \"On the Backs of Angels,\" and try to remember ANYTHING from that song. It sounds just like (and I mean JUST LIKE) \"Pull Me Under,\" but with what little life THAT song had sucked out of it. \n\nI now find myself writing the review of most Dream Theater detractors--- it's obvious the members of DT are very talented musicians, but they're not really doing anything with this talent. They're piss-poor songwriters, especially John Petrucci, goddamn... Just listen to that closing ballad, \"Beneath the Surface,\" penned exclusively by Petrucci. (\"ballad\" and \"Petrucci\" in the same sentence? Yeah, you know it's gonna be painful) What a buncha pseudo-emotional bullshit. \"Until one day I stopped caring, And began to forget why I longed to be so close, And I disappeared into the darkness, And the darkness turned to pain, And never went away...\" Puke. Oddly enough, though, \"Beneath the Surface\" is probably the catchiest/most memorable song on the album. Just goes to show catchy doesn't always equal good.\n\nThe big question on everyone's minds (probably) is \"how does Mike Mangini fare in DT?\" He's... okay, I guess. Just as technically tight as everyone else in the band, but far less self-indulgent. He doesn't contribute any songwriting, though. Perhaps next album will see him doing some lyrics, and then we'll see the true capabilities of the new skinsman. For God's sake, though, please don't give him the microphone. \n\nAs for the rest of the band. Jordan Ruddess's keyboards add a bit more atmosphere than on the past few DT albums (but don't worry, there's still plenty of wanking to be had from the keys maestro!) John Petrucci scales back a bit on the speed (just a bit) with his guitar-playing, but it's still noticeably Petrucci. John Myung is actually... audible? What the fuck?! That's right, everyone's favorite underrated bassist actually gets a chance to remind everyone that, yes there is indeed a fifth member of DT. (he even gets his first co-writing credit since friggin' \"Lines in the Sand\" AND a bass solo on \"Outcry!\") And finally, James LaBrie is probably the worst player on this album, sounding detached from the music with an emotionless mid-range throughout most of it. Then again, he's never been the best singer; it's probably just his Canadian blandness reaching a career high. \n\nNo particular songs stand out as being either good or bad. They're kinda just there, with the occasional catchy chorus (\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\" come to mind). Some parts may grab you (the two-minute jam at the beginning of \"Lost Not Forgotten\" sounds pretty cool), but the album as a whole sounds kind of... empty. There's not much substance here, and the songs all seem to kind of run together into one big ol' jam session. But at this album's core, it's still Dream Theater, with 10-minute songs and technical-as-fuck solos abound. They could have made a much, much worse album. In the end, this album is kind of like Stratovarius' \"Polaris\": it's not meant to be a great album, it's just supposed to be an album that shows that DT can manage without a longtime member. The next album is probably going to be great, because they now have a chance to really get their shit together, get \"new Mike\" more involved, and maybe even evolve their sound a bit. (you gotta admit, the material on this album does kinda blend into the rest of DT's discography)\n\n**on a side-note, I think \"Bridges in the Sky\" should have stuck with its original title, \"The Shaman's Trance.\" Fuck, that's a cool title. On top of that, it would have made the guttural belching at the beginning and end of the song make a bit more sense. \n\n***edited a misfact, and added a little more to the review\n",
        "\nWhen Mike Portnoy left Dream Theater I was truly surprised and shocked, not sure if I would continue to follow Dream Theater's next albums. But as time was passing by, bringing us closer to their new release, my thoughts changed. I said: \"Wait a minute, I can't regret that Mike Portnoy made Dream Theater what they are today, but with the help of John Petrucci, Jordan Rudess, John Myung and James LaBrie, each one being a great musician and composer by himself also. So by hearing A Dramatic Turn Of Events I was surprised, in a good way this time.\n\nThe achievement here is that Dream Theater needed Mike Portnoy to leave, to make another masterpiece and that is reflected in every second of every song. All the members are more refreshed than ever. Jordan Rudess is free to play now, without someone holding him back and limiting his style. And the result is really great. All the classic Dream Theater elements are here. It reminded me from time to time of Images & Words, Scenes From A Memory and Train Of Thought, combined together. In the first audition you will feel excited by the catchy choruses, but every time you hear the songs, they will grow different in your mind. You will see the work that it's done here in many layers, behind the catchy sounds. You may feel stunned (in a good way) by the oriental scales on the epics Bridges in The Sky and Outcry but you may also cry hearing Far From Heaven and Beneath The Surface, proving that John Petrucci is in a great form and not to mention his great both technical and catchy solos. When I first heard the intro of This Is The Life I was shuddered by the feeling it delivered to me. And what can I say about Breaking All Illusions... only that it will become a Dream Theater classic over the years. All the songs have many emotions, melodies and they are very technical, but the remarkable thing is that they started a brand new chapter.\n\nMaybe Portnoy did the best thing for the band by quiting and in addition to that, another \"monster\" came to fill his position, without a single gap. Mike Mangini gave Dream Theater exactly what they needed to continue making excellent albums. In every aspect, A Dramatic Turn Of Events is a spectacular masterpiece and the best they made since Scenes From A Memory. And this is only the beginning...\n",
        "\nWhen Mike Portnoy announced his departure from Dream Theater due to conflicting plans with rest of the band, many diehard Dream Theater fans like myself thought it to be one of the worst things to happen. Since the band's inception 20-plus years ago, Portnoy has written half of the songs and produced nearly every album. His fluid and fast-paced drumming earned him the status as one of the best and most respected drummers in metal. But only a year later, the progressive metal outfit was able to regroup and put out a new album with brand new drummer Mike Mangini, another respected metal drummer and no stranger to the band, as he performed on James' LaBrie's solo album Elements of Persuasion. Though the band's ability to so quickly put out a new album and hire a new drummer was truly surprising, A Dramatic Turn of Events ends up being a fresh new chapter in the band's history while retaining the elements that made them great.\n\nThe first aspect to address would be the album's biggest change: Mike Mangini. It should be noted that he himself did not write the drum arrangements. Rather, Petrucci previously programmed the drumming and had Mangini learn them after his hiring. Although the drum compositions are not of his own creation, he does a truly remarkable job with his drumming, balancing between rapid-fire and slower tempos perfectly. The only problem is the fact that he had extremely large shoes to fill in the form of Portnoy, who's drumming has always been loud and prominent in every Dream Theater song, while Mangini's are more in the background, which is a pitfall most metal bands fall in. And yet, Mangini is still able to stand out and make use of many of the interesting drum sounds and beats Portnoy himself used.\n\nThe songwriting is also worth noting. For the past few years, Portnoy and Petrucci had basically been the sole two songwriters and seemed to call most of the shots when it came to creative control. Not much has changed, as Petrucci remains the main lyricist, but the entire album gives more breathing room to the rest of the band as they are credited with writing the music on almost every song. John Myung's co-writing of Breaking All Illusions is the first song he has penned since Fatal Tragedy in 1999. James LaBrie is also credited as the sole lyricist of Far From Heaven. Though Portnoy's departure was unfortunate, it can be implied that without his creative control along with Petrucci, every individual band member has been given more freedom, which is what makes this album so fresh and new.\n\nThe album's title reminds us that this album is all about change, and the musical styling is the most important. Don't get me wrong, there are still plenty of ten-plus minute songs, long and intricate solos, dynamic vocals by LaBrie, and melody and progression changes that has been the band's staple. After all, Dream Theater's emphasis has always been on musicianship, and that remains the case for this album. But by while still following a similar formula, the band is also able to elevate songs to higher levels, giving each track a sense of granduer and majesty. The opener and lead single, On the Backs of Angels, starts off with a slow acoustic guitar and keyboard section before erupting into a full band effort. The medium pace stays consistent for the entire eight or so minutes and contains a very catchy chorus, giving it a Pull Me Underish feel. The next song, Build Me Up Break Me Down, which is a critique on America's worship and ridicule of troubled celebrities, shows the band's more commercial side with a more straightforward metal feel along with a catchy chorus. It even contains and electronic, almost nu metal-style beginning and ultimately sounds very similar to something you would hear on one of LaBrie's solo albums. The track ends up being one of the album's most pleasant surprises. The album also contains its share of softer songs, with This is the Life and Far from Heaven. Both are sentimental and beautifully composed, especially Far from Heaven, which truly shows James LaBrie's abilities as a songwriter. There are also four songs that clock in at over ten minutes: Lost Not Forgotten, Bridges in the Sky, Outcry, and Breaking All Illusions. Lost Not Forgotten stands out as a track that while it is over ten minutes long, it does not feature only a few minutes of LaBrie's singing, as he remains fairly consistent throughout the whole song. With the song being about an ancient Persian kingdom, there are a few Middle Eastern elements as well. While the grunting sound effects in the intro of Bridges in the Sky are a bit ridiculous, the song is primarily fast-paced and has a strong metal feel along with emotional lyrics delivered perfectly by LaBrie. There is also, of course, an extended instrumental segment. Outcry follows a similar vein, this time with inspirational lyrics of standing up against war and corruption. Unfortunately, LaBrie once again stays out of a good portion of the song. Breaking All Illusions, the penultimate song, serves as a sort of grand finale, and has a very strong and majestic opening with an emotional and awe-inspiring chorus delivered by LaBrie. Though LaBrie once again takes a backseat in the bridge, the instrumentation is absolutely fabulous and features a stunning solo by Petrucci. This is obviously the most important song on the album and one the band clearly took its time in composing. The final song, Beneath the Surface, acts as a sort of cool-down from the energy of Breaking all Illusions, and is one perhaps of the most emotional and finest songs the band has ever written.\n\nWith this album promising to bring change to the Dream Theater legacy, the band passes with flying colors in delivering a new and unique experience. Though Mike Portnoy will surely be missed by diehard fans (including yours truly) it may also have been a blessing in disguise. Even though Dream Theater's past few albums have all been exceptional (not to mention underrated) this album acts as almost a fresh breath of air and promises new and exciting things from the band. That was no easy task, considering the loss of one of their main creative forces and one of their most stellar musicians, and doing it all in just one year. A dramatic turn of events indeed!\n",
        "\n'A Dramatic Turn Of Events' is the most unsuitable title for Dream Theater's new album.\nThere is nothing \"dramatic\" about this album and all the events had already happened \ndozens of times before. Mike Mangini, new drummer of the band, isn't noticeable a bit \nand sounds exactly like Mike Potrnoy. In fact, he wasn't involved in the writing process\nof this album and he's just there to fill the empty void that Portnoy left. Yep, they replaced\nan old Mike with a new one!\n\nSo what we basically get to listen in this new record? Anything but new tunes, how ironic.\n77 minutes full of nothing but sheer technical masturbation that goes nowhere plus generic\nand emotionless vocals of Labrie that sings Petrucci's generic and emotionless lyrics.\nWhen \"On The Backs Of Angels\" first came out as a single I was slightly disappointed.\nThere wasn't any inspiring riffs or leads, only casual 7 strings heavy distorted guitar\nriffs plus some forgettable keyboard's interludes and the usual show offs that Petruccie \nis so well known for. Even the chorus didn't sound as catchy as a single should be. All in all\nI thought it was quite a meaningless song but I was horrified to discover that this is actually\nthe best song in the whole album.\n\nYeah, it doesn't get better than that. The rest of the album is filled with desperate attempts\nat composing some mainstream radio hits ('Build Me Up, Break Me Down', 'Far From Heaven' & 'Benath The Surface') beside embarrassing attemps to return to the gold days of 'Images & Words' sophistication and courage that ends up sounding confused and without any direction ('Breaking All Illusions').\n\nThe most irritating song in this album, and probably in all Dream Theater's career is without any doubt 'Bridges In The Sky'. It opens with some eerie low guttural sound that precede some weird ecclesiastical A cappella, and then comes some generic power chords riff and the stupid lyrics of Petruccie (\"Death survivor...take me higher...reunite my soul\". Yeah, whatever.). The chorus is awkward and boring as hell and the technical masturbation that comes later just completley kills this futile song.\n\nIt's a shame that this band force themselves to release new music. It's obvious that they lost their inspiration long time ago and they should just stick with their live tours and play their classics. 'A Dramatic Turn of Events' is a new product from a giant trademark named as 'Dream Theater', not a group of musicians that trying to explore and reach new districts in the wonderful world of music, as once was.\n",
        "\nSo, a while ago my friend told me that Dream Theater had a new single out. As a huge fan, I rushed to youtube to give it a listen. The first thing you notice is the intro of the song. Very atmospheric arpeggiated intro sounded great. At the point where the synth came in with the choir sound I knew that I was listening to something epic.\n\nThe very first line of the song, \"Standing at the backs of angels\", followed by the epic \"We spiral towards disaster\" promised a great vocal performance. Vocals remained great until the chorus, which I think is the weakest part of the song. I'm still pretty happy with the vocals, very catchy, always get me singing along. \n\nAfter the guitar solo I realized that Petrucci had taken the focus off the shredding and is concentrating on the melody. This is great, as my favorite guitar solos from Dream Theater are the slower, melodic solos like Octavarium, Lines in the Sand or Repentance. Otherwise Petrucci's tone is great, fused with Rudess's epic keyboard playing and John Myungs basslines we have the perfect Instrumentation. Only weak part of the instruments are Mangini's percussions, which are pretty basic DT drumming. But that is understandable, him being new to the band.\n\nOverall, this song is perfect for live performances. This really gets the crowd going, It has cool melodies and catchy vocals which are easy to sing along. Only things that prevent me from giving a 100% are the chorus and the percussions. The chorus could have been more epic, It's a mismatch with the rest of the vocal performance. And there could have been more focus on the drumming, especially because they have a new drummer.\n\nSo, vocals -5% and percussions -10%, leaving a respectable 85% rating. I still have to say that Dream Theater is back, this sounds better than any of their last four albums, maybe an exception on Octavarium. Can't wait to hear the rest of A Dramatic Turn of Events.\n",
        "\nA Dramatic Turn of Events marks the first lineup shift for these giants in over a decade, and a welcome change it is. Looking back on Dream Theater\u2019s career, you can easily partition off eras based on the lineup of the band. I have begun to notice even more as Dream Theater discs continue to spin in my player that the Derek-era and the Rudess-era are lacking in something, and upon the release of this album I discovered what that was: heart. A Dramatic Turn of Events is a resurgence of lifeblood for these ailing giants and presents a welcome change from the career direction championed by Mike Portnoy.\n\nBefore I talk about the band politics, let me describe why I enjoyed this album from a musical perspective. Yes, many elements of Dream Theater\u2019s sounds still remain: Petrucci\u2019s proggy riffing and speedy solos, LaBrie\u2019s questionable vocals (admittedly getting better as his voice continues to heal from his food poisoning bout), and immense song lengths. This is still most definitely a Dream Theater album. The band, however, does try some new stuff on this album. Rudess\u2019s keyboard work has traditionally been restricted to either ragtime or other piano interludes, intense solos and leads, and barely heard atmospheric keyboards (with the occasional exception). On A Dramatic Turn\u2026 we hear some new things from the Wizard. His atmospheric keyboards are all of a sudden audible! And then there\u2019s the techno present in songs like Build Me Up, Break Me Down. This is a point that I believe many will disagree on. I find this stylistic change welcoming, as Rudess has historically been underutilized in my opinion. In addition, while from a technical stand point I enjoyed the progressive styling the group presented in all their work, this more scaled down version is welcome, unlike the version present on Octavarium. What sets these two albums apart is the songwriting. Octavarium was a poorly written album while A Dramatic Turn\u2026 has much better songwriting, making the reduced shredding and proggy riffs welcome. In fact, the songs that feature a wealth of these elements fall flat compared to the rest of the album (namely Lost Not Forgotten with its extended technical intro). It\u2019s clear that the band made a conscious shift here, ending up with a better, more song-driven album because of it.\n\nThis brings me to the political elements. Removing the Portnoy from the band seems to have freed up the songwriting reigns, allowing those who remain to gain more creative control. It has become evident listening to every album from Scenes from a Memory to Black Clouds\u2026 that intense producing control by Portnoy was stifling the band\u2019s songwriting ability. What\u2019s more, Portnoy\u2019s intense control over the band turned LaBrie, Rudess, and Myung into puppets, slaves to the production prowess of Portnoy and Petrucci. Portnoy\u2019s departure freed up the consciousness of the band, turning the puppets into participants in the process. This helped reinvigorate a band formerly run by a haggard work-/alcoholic. At this point, Mangini feels like just a hired hand, his drums featured less prominently than Portnoy\u2019s were and not as invigorating as they could have been, but Mangini did not participate in writing the album, and was instead given programmed drum tracks to learn. I hope Dream Theater makes further use of Mangini in the future, as this would enhance the drum parts.\n\nIn summary, Portnoy\u2019s departure was probably the best thing to happen to Dream Theater at this point in their career. The juggernaut has been reinvigorated with new blood and a new perspective on how to approach an album. While this may seem to some very un-Dream Theater (or a bit too Dream Theater to the previous reviewer), I would encourage listeners to look at this the same way they look at Scenes from a Memory following Awake (Falling into Infinity was simply a stop on the road to the next town).\n",
        "\nDream Theater return from critically acclaimed fifth album \"Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From A Memory\" with a new formula and ideas. With the greatness (but inconsistency) of their last album, how could this new album be bad? Definitely far off-base with that thought.\n\nThe album starts out with some impressive instrumentation from the boys and all is looking well, however the riffage soon turns to what could only be described as...nu metal riffs. I can only imagine what they were thinking when they thought using turntable scratching and Korn chugs. I'm sure it seemed quite natural with John Petrucci's TRIPP pants. The album continues with more of the same. The 5 songs presented to us on DISC 1 seem to really hold all the same crummy atmosphere. Not to say they all sound alike, but most of the ideas on this are so downtrodden, as if they were so depressed from being so out of ideas they wrote this. \"The Great Debate\" however offers something Dream Theater used later in their career, and that's using sound clips in most of a song. Even when the song does kick in with vocals, they are very held back. If I had to pick a favorite track from Disc 1, it would probably be \"Misunderstood\" even though the song is mostly bland, but the chorus isn't bad.\n\nThere are some extremely positive elements to this album, but none of them lie on the first disc. In fact, the only reason this album isn't getting a 10 percent is because of the second disc. The \"Song\" on the second disc is definitely DREAM THEATER full force. It's amazing that the second disc holds so many moods, landscapes, ideas, and sounds in comparison to the first disc. It's almost like they were written at two different times. \n\nMy advice to anyone looking to get into this album is to stay away from the first disc. My overall score is definitely not aimed towards the first cd.\n",
        "\nAmong crowds of Dream Theater fans, Falling Into Infinity frequently draws the most hate of all the band's albums, and is nearly unanimously the choice for Dream Theater's worst release to date. It garners a tremendous amount of hate for being a \"sellout\" and for being a classic example of how a major record label \"takes over a band and ruins it.\" What bothers me, though, is that although such claims are legitimately founded in reality, the finished product would indicate to the contrary. The album may be more mellow than any of Dream Theater's other releases, but in no way does that make it mainstream.\n\nFalling Into Infinity opens strong with \"New Millennium\", which immediately gets to work showcasing the abilities of the band's then-relatively-new keyboardist Derek Sherinian. The mellow, laid back tone on many of this album's songs allows for the keyboards to really come to the forefront, and the album benefits greatly from it, because Derek Sherinian's performance is excellent. His style is very different from that of his predecessor or successor, but that doesn't make it any less outstanding.\n\n\"New Millennium\", although a decent opening track, doesn't really stand out to me as one of the album's best. However, it accomplishes exactly what an opening track needs to do: get the listener's attention and set the pace for what's to come. In that regard, the song is fantastic, as it lays the groundwork for the album with relatively gentle tones, chugging rhythms, and well-defined bass and keyboard lines. The unfortunate downfall of this album is the song that comes immediately thereafter. Butchered by EastWest in production, \"You Not Me\" is absolute garbage and really makes the album as a whole stumble over itself before picking up again. \n\nThough it would seem from what has been stated already that the album by track two is a disaster in the making, this couldn't be further from the truth. The remaining songs on the album are unexpectedly great. \"Peruvian Skies\" is reminiscent of a Metallica ballad, starting with several minutes of a slower section telling some sort of tale and then picking up with a much heavier second half. The latter half of this song is probably the heaviest section of the album, and although many fans decry that it's not nearly heavy enough, I claim that point is moot, because it absolutely rocks and I can't help but bang my head whenever I hear it. \n\nThere are a couple of other head-bangingly awesome moments on the album, most notably \"Burning My Soul,\" which is defined by a style of riffing that Dream Theater has never done before and never did again. Its uniqueness is perhaps what makes it stick out in my mind, but it's also catchy as can be and is a rock solid song as far as I'm concerned. It also marks the beginning of a long, overarching middle section of the album, featuring three connected tracks. \"Burning My Soul\", \"Hell's Kitchen\", and \"Lines in the Sand\" all flow beautifully into one another.\n\n\"Hell's Kitchen\", in my opinion, is second only to \"The Dance of Eternity\" in Dream Theater's catalog of instrumental songs, and is a much less challenging listen. Honestly, it's downright serene, and so is the introduction to \"Lines in the Sand\". Having owned the album for many years, it's still tough for me to tell when one has ended and the other has begun, because they flow together that well. \"Lines in the Sand\" is a new approach to a Dream Theater epic. It's really experimental at times, with some strange riffs and breakdowns, but that's what makes it so memorable. And criticize it as you may, Doug Pinnick's guest vocals on \"Lines in the Sand\" really do add to the song as a whole. \n\n\"Just Let Me Breathe\" is another major highlight of the album, greatly expanding upon the low, chugging riffs first explored in the opening track. The vocals are fantastic, as LaBrie does an excellent job of thoroughly berating the popular music industry, which is beautifully poignant given the stifling circumstances under which this album was created and for which it is so frequently criticized. The solos in this song are out of this world. The dual-tracked keyboard solo in particular typically makes me feel like Derek Sherinian is attempting to rip my skull in half, my ears being tugged in two different directions in rapid succession. \n\nThe closing track, \"Trial of Tears\", is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs and is almost certainly the strongest song on the album. The entrance is serene, and the first movement filled to the brim with excellent riff work. Also notable is LaBrie's vocal performance, which I think is one of his best, and the outstanding solo work by John Petrucci, which comes to the forefront in the instrumental second movement. The closing sections of the song are powerful, filled with emotion, and beautiful, which gives the album a tremendous ending.\n\nOverall, I can't justify the ire this album usually draws. It's easy on the ears, but it's still solid like a rock. Though it's not my favorite Dream Theater album, it's one of my top picks, and I look forward to listening to it for many years to come.\n\nHighlights: \"Hell's Kitchen\", \"Just Let Me Breathe\", \"Trial of Tears\"\n",
        "\nImages and Words was the first album that brought critical and popular attention to the Long Island-based progressive metal band Dream Theater, although to simply label their music as Progressive Metal is disingenuous to say the least. Dream Theater\u2019s work runs the gamut from virtuosic instrumental jams to gentle piano ballads, and nearly everything in between. The band\u2019s many influences are always in the forefront of the music on Images and Words.\n\nIn the progressive rock tradition, Images and Words appears to have less music than actually is present. There are only 8 songs, which might lead one to believe that it is lacking. But out of these 8 songs, half are over 8 minutes long, which shows just how serious these guys are about their songwriting. The record is littered with extended instrumental breaks and solos on every instrument. For a listener who isn\u2019t already accustomed to the constant key and time signature changes in progressive metal, this album might be a little disconcerting, especially on cuts like \u201cMetropolis Pt. I\u201d, where numerous polyrhythmic shifts leave even the most jaded prog fan dazed.\n\nIt is clear that Dream Theater delivered on the \u201cprogressive\u201d end, but it is less clear whether or not they fulfilled their requirements in the \u201cmetal\u201d department as well. Images and Words has an unabashedly \u201csmooth jazz\u201d feel throughout, which initially seems out of place in a metal album, but which the listener soon begins to appreciate and integrate into their definition of the genre. The chorusy steel-string guitar on the first verse section of \u201cTake the Time\u201d and the soprano sax solo on \u201cAnother Day\u201d reek of Spyro Gyra, but this isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it is kind of refreshing to see a metal band absorb influences from other genres. This record was the first to feature now-customary \u201cinspirational songs\u201d by the band. Their unique ability to pen anthems for empathy and self-esteem make them stand out in the genre. Many consider them wimps, but I think that their softer side gives them a dimension that is hard to find in the modern metal landscape. And despite all of the softer songs on the record, one must not overlook the rockers. \u201cUnder a Glass Moon\u201d, with its heavy guitar riffs and double-kick action drumming, seems to loom over the rest of the album like an ominous thundercloud. And while songs like \u201cTake the Time\u201d and \u201cPull me Under\u201d may not feel like the typical hard-rock that you\u2019d expect from an early 90\u2019s metal release, they still have an unignorable drive and energy.\n\nThematically, Images and Words is inconsistent, to say the least. Most of the tracks\u2019 lyrics make little or no sense, and come off as vague attempts to generate some sort of mood by using poetic lyrics and utilizing the polyphonic potential of Kevin Moore\u2019s state-of-the-art synth pads (see \u201cUnder a Glass Moon\u201d and \u201cSurrounded\u201d). Although the single from the album, Pull Me Under, is considered the most lyrically consistent by most rock critics, I personally have gravitated towards the more political tracks on the album. At a time when even the most hard-edge punk bands were diluting their values for the sake of record sales, it is nice to see a band such as Dream Theater attempt to tackle such issues. They don\u2019t come off so much as firebrand activists as they do frustrated citizens (see \u201cTake the Time\u201d and \u201cLearning to Live\u201d), and although they really don\u2019t offer any real solutions or seem to fully understand the issues that they are shedding light on, there\u2019s still some real sincerity there that cannot be overlooked.\n\nThis is the first album on which James LaBrie sang vocals, and his performance is outstanding. Another high tenor in the prog world might warrant some eye-rolling from the wider rock critic community, but I find his voice to be especially conducive to the content on this record. I am, by no means, a James LaBrie fan; his vocal phrasing pales in comparison to many other rock singers. Yet I think he really pulled it off on this record, with stunning accuracy and perfect tone. The high notes on songs such as \u201cTake the Time\u201d and \u201cMetropolis Pt. I\u201d are hauntingly impeccable, and thanks to the factored-in instrumental breaks, one never feels he oversings.\n\nThere are many aspects of this record that I find very irritating. My primary qualm is with the production. The heavy reverb on all of the instruments, the extremely loud guitar tone and Portnoy\u2019s triggered snare drum are all highly irritating to me as a listener. At times, these aspects almost make the record feel fake and inhuman. The main problem with this production trend is that it leads to musically-perfect but otherwise sterile recordings. Then again though, Dream Theater as a band isn\u2019t all that energetic, even live. Another thing that I find maddening is the band\u2019s love affair with instrumental unisons. One of the reasons I became intrigued by earlier prog bands such as Rush, Yes and King Crimson were their ability to write countermelodies and jam in a synergic way. I see much less of this in modern progressive metal, and I feel that Dream Theater is, in a way, the antithesis of the Jam Band, which is sad because had there not been jam bands, prog wouldn\u2019t have come to be. Maybe I\u2019m just ranting here, but I find it odd that the pinnacle of progressive music is making something as simple as a 3-instrument unison the cornerstone of their musical riff breaks.\n\nOverall though, Images and Words is a very worthwhile listen. It\u2019s musical complexity and performance are hard to rival, and the songwriting, although shoddy at parts, is quite unique and has its own flair that DT fans have come to love over the years. Listen to this record, especially if you are a musician. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\n",
        "\nI would like to leave a little disclaimer as follows: \u201cDue to the lengthy nature of this album, its review has been divided into two sections as per discs and were scored separately. The final number was an average of the two. Now I believe it is only fair to warn you that this was indeed my first Dream Theater album, although I have listened to a number of others since then. As a result, I might have a pretty bad bias on the awesomeness of the music compared to a seasoned Dream Theater veteran who bought this album when it was brand new and wrote a review.\u201d\n\nSo the first disc on this album contains mostly longer songs, with double digit giants like The Glass Prison, Blind Faith, and The Great Debate. The first song, The Glass Prison, is easily the best song on the album. In the same way, it easily has the best riffing, solos from all instruments, and great lyrics that hit home hard with me. The riffing flirts with thrash metal at some points and heavy Dream Theater riffs common on every album. The three movements have distinctly different themes which add spice to a long song which can very easily get boring. James LaBrie also shines in this song, with interesting vocal effects.\n\nBlind Faith continues the trend of interesting lyrics, as well as with some of the best keys on the entire album. This song is quite awesome, but not quite as good as the first. This trend continues, as Misunderstood has an interesting acoustic intro with a good chorus that gets everybody into it. However, the song is absolutely destroyed (in a bad way) when the weird sets in. The guitars transform into some sort of howl that kills the rest of the setup the beginning of the song provided.\n\nThis trend continues, with my least favorite song on the first disc, The Great Debate. The lyrics contain subject matter which I don\u2019t exactly care about unless I\u2019m listening to a political band like Dying Fetus. I have not physically been able to listen to this song all the way through. I get about 8 minutes through it and get sick of the crap I am handed and refuse to call that Dream Theater. The keys are all over the place, LaBrie sound like he just came from the dentist with 6 root canals, and Petrucci plays the guitar transparently.\n\nOkay, now that I\u2019ve calmed down, let\u2019s continue. The disc finishes out with Disappear, a nice mellow song that calms you down from the horrific nightmare of the previous song. Overall this disc presents us with mellow keys that provide a nice backdrop and twist and turn ferociously in sync with the guitar solos, and the guitars switch things up the rest of the time as well. Mellow guitars on Misunderstood and Disappear, skull shattering riffs on Blind Faith and The Glass Prison. Mike Portnoy is all over his set and does not disappoint (except in how he recently left the band, but that\u2019s a rant for another time), with some really fast sections and takes the back seat at times, creating a nice balance. LaBrie shines with his lyrics that contain interesting and original thinking, most apparent in Blind Faith, and as usual throws his all into the song, something that sets him apart. This disc does a nice job of showing how progressive they are with orchestras, acoustic guitar, fun sounds like police sirens and breaking glass, etc., as well as with whatever it is making those sounds on Disappear. Rating: 87%. Best songs: The Glass Prison and Blind Faith, but stay away from The Great Debate.\n\nSo now it\u2019s time for round two. The second disc is comprised of one song that is divided into 8 minutes, bearing the name of the album, although each of the movements can be regarded as an individual track that even has a separate name. We are given a lot of variance on here, and this ends up being for better or for worse. The rock opera that they were going for is lost due to a lack of an overarching continuity in all of the songs. \n\nConsistency is certainly found in the overture, which adequately displays all of the movements of the pieces in one fluid sound, succeeding at that rock opera approach. It is instrumental as well, which helps with that. It features an impressive repertoire of sounds, with slow drum sections, heavy orchestra, and some sounds that are difficult to describe on paper but are yet present. Odd sounds also come into play later, in the movement called Goodnight Kiss. This is a particularly disturbing movement, with sound effects that are offset from the typical lightness of a Dream Theater work. As such, I thoroughly dislike this as my least favorite track on the album. The finale also is styled the same as these two, but it is boring and way too drawn out to amount to much while trying to incorporate a regular song. The song is also a low point.\n\nCurveballs are also thrown in the third and fourth movements. The lyrics are rough and tough styled around mental illness, and the instrumentals reflect that. The guitars go from low and heavy tones to technical and unmelodic. James LaBrie adds interesting vocal flavor, and Mike Portnoy lays it all on the line in these songs. The keyboards are barely present here aside from adding a little bit of flavor here and there, where they are overbearing elsewhere on the album. This makes for a very good and heavy section.\n\nThe other three songs are grouped together pretty easily. After all, two of them are the same song title. These also deal heavily in mental depression and insanity with their lyrics, and the singing is phenomenal, which is not an accolade I usually patch on vocalists, as I do prefer me some roars and screams. These songs pack way too much keyboard, as piano leads every song and is incredibly overbearing and allows little else progress to be made. The guitars are featured with some nice solos but take a backseat most of the time. I was also surprised by the use of acoustic guitar in the very mellow song that is Solitary Shell (on another note, if you think they stole that from Slipknot, it is pretty sad that a band can become so crappy that their ideas seem better than yours). Portnoy continues in the same fashion here.\n\nThis is definitely the weaker half of the album, as things are all over the place and the songs are a bit too varied to maintain itself as a rock opera. The lyrics aren\u2019t even following the same storyline; they just all have to deal with mental health. Nonetheless, there is still some great material here when it is taking out of context. Best movements: 2, 3, 4, and 6. Stay away from 5 and 8. Rating: 78%.\n\nSo let\u2019s sum up this album quickly. The drums and guitars are intense in instances, but fail in other situations. Heavy songs are the best on here, with some of the lighter ventures going to waste as they fail to contain many ideas that are good. The keyboards as a whole are overbearing, and I miss the days when the keyboardist was a part of the band rather than a virtuoso. Bass doesn\u2019t come through much but sounds awesome when it does; and the vocals are killer on this album. I believe them to be some of his best. I would say this album is worth getting if you see it, but not exactly worth it to go out of your way. Heck, you might even get away with only buying a few of the songs. In fact, here are some suggestions: The Glass Prison, Blind Faith, The Test That Stumped Them All, and Solitary Shell.\n",
        "\nAbout four years ago now, every metalhead's favorite \"trendwhore\" punching bag of a record label, Roadrunner Records, signed two of the biggest and most popular metal acts throughout the world. One of these bands was Dream Theater, which to me was the more shocking and nerve racking of the two musical acts. Dream Theater paired up with Roadrunner? This must be some kind of bad dream. Could a Dream Theater/Roadrunner pairing result in a real mallcore outing like die-hard Dream Theater fans thought Train of Thought was? Well those two bands had their Roadrunner debuts come out in the same day, and with the other band's album I bought Systematic Chaos. \n\nThankfully, Systematic Chaos is not a mallcore album. In fact, it is not that bad of an album in general. Dream Theater's Roadrunner debut contains everything you would want in a Dream Theater album; well crafted progressive metal, high levels of instrumental technicality, and great individual performances meshing together to form a sum greater then their individual parts. Still, Systematic Chaos gets a lot of unnecessary criticism from Dream Theater fans for a variety of reasons. While those reasons are more spelled in musical fact then silly assumptions (as in the case of Train of Thought), this is a clearly tone downed album by Dream Theater, and you can tell they were clearly held down by the creative restrictions of a Roadrunner imposed musical insurance policy. \n\nThere are a lot of good things to like about Systematic Chaos, but I think arguably the best thing about this album is James Labrie. This is arguably James Labrie's best performance on a Dream Theater album, and for one very big reason. Throughout Dream Theater's history, I have never heard Labrie manage to achieve a sense of equilibrium between emotion and aggression so consistently throughout the album. In the past, there were moments where I thought Labrie was trying to be overly emotional to the point where it was grossly excessive (check Metropolis Pt. 2 or Octavarium), or there were times when he tried to be overtly aggressive (Train of Thought, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence) and it sounded weak. The fact is, the best Dream Theater songs are often the ones where he finds this sense of balance (among other things), and what makes his performance on Systematic Chaos so good is that he strings together these performances pretty consistently together throughout five of the eight tracks on this album. Aside from the use of vocal distortion briefly on The Dark Eternal Night and his performance on The Ministry of Lost Souls, Labrie's performance on Systematic Chaos is the best among the individual members. \n\nI couple this in by a really top notch performance by keyboardist Jordan Ruddess. After two albums where I felt Jordan's work really lagged behind the other members and he was just being lazy, Jordan really steps up his performance on Systematic Chaos. First of all, it's just that he is playing more often that makes all the difference! For the first time in awhile, Jordan seems to use his keyboards outside of the confines of solo duels or instrumental sections of songs. Not only that, they seem to add something to the songs. Keyboards help drive along songs like \"In the Presence of Enemies\", \"Forsaken\", and \"Prophets of War\", and they largely succeed in such a role. There is also an increased variety in keyboard sounds, moving away from strictly synths to using some basic piano sounds and some orchestra string like sounds. Jordan's performance adds very greatly to this album, and I like that he sounded like he really contributed to the band for the first time in a few years. \n\nHowever, after these guys, one can start to hear Roadrunner's insurance policy taken out on Dream Theater taking effect. The member arguably effected by this the most is John Petrucci. Despite the increased use of Jordan Ruddess, Systematic Chaos is arguably Dream Theater's most guitar centric album. Do not take this though as their being too much guitar work on this album. While on Train of Thought John's riffs were able to really carry the songs on their own and in Octavarium they were not able to do that, Systematic Chaos is kind of in between those two. Clearly Roadrunner wanted Dream Theater to really rely on John's guitar work to carry the songs, and it does not work for the most part. The one song it does work on, The Dark Eternal Night, does this great, but the others (Constant Motion in particular) do not do this nearly as well. The riffs just simply are not good enough for the most part. The other thing is that compared to the two albums that proceeded it, John's solos are not nearly as good as they were previously. It's almost like he relied too much on his alternate picking skill and did not really try anything else, because the solos just sound toned down compared to everything else he has done. While they are still very good solos in the grand spectrum of guitar solos, they are not the best that he has done by a wide margin and it hurts the music. \n\nThe other major issue on this album is Mike Portnoy. The drum work on Systematic Chaos is really sub par compared to other Dream Theater albums. The problems I have here with such result really from a bad use of certain beats at certain times. There are times when Portnoy uses a really technical sounding rhythm in a part where such a thing is not necessary, and he uses a basic sounding rhythm when such a rhythm does fit the tone. While I do appreciate his increased use of double bass and attempts at being faster, he simply does not get it right. The other thing that really annoys me about Portnoy on this album is his creative meddling in aspects like the lyrics and vocals. The extra vocals on Constant Motion and The Dark Eternal Night are an attempt to add aggression, yet they are just so painfully laughable and are not quality at all. \n\nJohn Myung's work speaks for itself, so I am just going to skip to the lyrics. Systematic Chaos's lyrics are good for the most part, when they're written by John Petrucci and not by Mike Portnoy. In the Presence of Enemies is a great depiction of someone struggling between good and evil, Forsaken is a pretty good attempt at writing about vampirism, and Ministry of Lost Souls is a masterfully poetic piece about drowning and being saved from such a fate. But this is not the case for Mike Portnoy. His lyrics for the most part stink. His Twelve Step Suite starts growing stale by this point, and Constant Motion's lyrics about obsessive compulsive disorder are interesting but again, sound poorly written. The one exception to this is Prophets of War, who's lyrics were written by James Labrie. This is a rare attempt at Dream Theater sounding politicized, and it actually works for the most part, calling into question the ethics and reasoning behind the invasion of Iraq in 2003 without ever mentioning such. It is thought provoking to say the least, and I think Labrie did a great job with this. He should really be allowed to write more lyrics on Dream Theater albums. \n\nThe mix on Systematic Chaos is one that to me raises a lot of questions. By no means is this a bad mix, it actually sounds pretty good for the most part. Mike's drums sound crystal clear and more drum like then they ever have, and his cymbals have just the right cut in the mix to be heard. The bass work of John Myung can be heard under everything else pretty well but not overpowering. Labrie's vocals are crystal clear. Here is the problem though. For an album that attempts to be carried by the guitar, the guitars on Systematic Chaos sound way pushed back in the mix, to the point where they almost sound over powered and rather mechanical with the rhythms. The leads are out there for all to hear, but John's lead tone is not as good as other Dream Theater albums. The keyboards also sound kind of pushed back, which is not really fair considering how good they are for the most part. All in all, Dream Theater could have done a better mix on Systematic Chaos. \n\nSystematic Chaos was Dream Theater's Roadrunner Records debut, and it is one that sounds like it was clearly effected by Roadrunner. With the key aspects of Dream Theater toned down to the point where they offset the great performances by Labrie and Ruddess and a not so great mix, this album is one that is not one of Dream Theater's greatest efforts by any stretch. Clearly, Dream Theater was in the presence of Roadrunner Records when they were recording Systematic Chaos.\n",
        "\nName any Dream Theater album post 1994's \"Awake\" and I'll find something to complain about. \"Falling Into Infinity\" was too mellow, \"Octavarium\" too modern, \"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\u201d a disjointed tub of brilliance and sluggishness-even their proclaimed magnum opus, \u201cMetropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\u201d although largely masterfully crafted, had its moments of blinding excesses that became boring slabs of gratuitous ugliness. Only 2001\u2019s \u201cTrain of Thought\u201d brought back the compulsive side of Dream Thetaer. It was concise and to the point, its only fault being that most of the material was instantly forgettable.\n\nIf \u201cSystematic Chaos\u201d was a glimpse of the band retracing their steps then \u201cBlack Clouds and Silver Linings\u201d represents the final homecoming in full glare.\nAnd I have absolutely nothing to complain about. This is Dream Theater operating in the same element they were in when delivering \u201cImages and Words\u201d, their truly first and most foremost of their records.\nLike \u201cAwake\u201d it is explosive, taut and bursting with expression and like \u201cTrain of Thought\u201d it is concise, masterful and teeming with aggression. Fortunately, we are spared a giant instrumental like \u201cStream Of Consciousness\u201d whose rambling and masturbatory texture forever blighted \u201cTrain of Thought\u201d. \n\nJohn Petrucci works some major charms. His riffing is very impressive but draws on rather traditional stylistic maneuvers. He draws on Lifeson, Blackmore and layers intricately in the same vein as Fripp and Iommi. His solos are rousing and provoking whilst maintaining enough fire in their scorching delights. Carefully laid out and equally traversing the domains of melodic and chaotic, they don\u2019t overshadow and they don\u2019t suffocate. He damn near gets it right on every song too. James LaBrie draws on himself. He has been reviled and cut little slack but he draws on the past; the strength and clarity of voice he had, the immense quality of emotional depth and distance and classic timbre he originally exhibited. He draws on all this and emerges penitent and revivified. He sings with heart. A professional who still enjoys what he\u2019s doing is the feeling you get-and with that, the conviction that he will possess a legacy. Like Petrucci, his tone is tending towards traditional realms. \n\nThe entire album reeks of timelessness. Progressive rock that is expertly done and that will hold up against the greats one fine day. Mike Portnoy sounds controlled but not restrained. He is not showy but his presence is felt all the same. The same can be said about John Myung who maintains a low profile yet adds a lot to the orchestral bits of the material. Jordan Ruddess on the other hand, is on fire. His lines are blazing and passionate yet he strikes a perfect balance between melody and chaos, one I felt he failed to strike on \u201cMetropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory\u201d, his debut with the band.\n\n\u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d highlights this fine balance as does \u201cA Nightmare to Remember\u201d. Both are very mature pieces, something you\u2019d frown upon if it were crafted by a genius-student band. Coming from these Prog metal veterans however, it feels altogether appropriate. On \u201cImages and Words\u201d, they had \u201cSurrounded\u201d and \u201cMetropolis Pt. 1\u201d which sounded vital and ambitious. With \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d and \u201cA Nightmare to Remember\u201d they sound defined by age and marked with it. \n\nIf you\u2019ve traveled with DT thus far, this feels like a warm homecoming. A place to rest your tired bones after all that chaotic glory. The end of glory does not immediately signal the onset of decay. Memory can be very rewarding. You might not necessarily keep that old spark alive as the tired clich\u00e9 demands, but you can use it to light a new one that better represents the point at which you have reached. On \u201cThe Shattered Fortress\u201d, Dream Theater\u2019s rich memory returns briefly to \u201cThe Glass Prison\u201d, \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d, \u201cRepentance\u201d and \u201cThe Root of All Evil\u201d and salvages a quality that eluded all those songs. It sounds ripe and ready-and as the end of the 12 Steps Suite, it makes the closure feel all the more worthy.\n\nA quick comment I can make about \u201cA Rite Of Passage\u201d is how it reminded me of orchestral Led Zeppelin a la \u201cKashmir\u201d, \u201cThe Song Remains the Same\u201d and \u201cAchilles Last Stand\u201d. Continuing in this orchestral spirit, the band turns in a second disc with great reworkings of Rainbow\u2019s \u201cStargazer\u201d, Iron Maiden\u2019s \u201cTo Tame a Land\u201d, King Crimson\u2019s \u201cA Lark\u2019s Tongue in Aspic (Part II) and a Queen medley.\n\u201cWither\u201d and \u201cThe Best of Times\u201d are brother and sister and their essence echoes the spirit of past gems like \u201cLifting Shadows off a Dream\u201d and \u201cTrial of Tears\u201d.\n\nThis is the sound of Dream Theater evaluating the basics of their craft with aged eyes. They salvage the best bits and use memory as the scepter that penetrates the airs of yet uncharted territory. And they arrive safe and sound, united in creative harmony. Will they be able to create so wonderfully again now that the circle is broken and Portnoy has left? That is a worry for another day. For now, we should be content to lay in this present slumber of memories both old and newly contrived. A slumber rich in antonyms-serene and chaotic, calculated and haphazard, cold and genial, pretentious and natural-that best describe the band. A slumber in the theater of one never ceasing dream.\n",
        "\nI first became introduced to Dream Theater when I heard Panic Attack from Rock Band 2. It was a cool song, so naturally I was interested when I received Images and Words, but I did not know what to fully expect. And then the slow guitar intro of Pull Me Under began, and I entered a world of music that which I've never experienced before. Simply put, the sophomore effort by Dream Theater is a true example of musicianship at its very best. Each member has his moment to shine and yet each instrument and solo blends perfectly with everyone else. \n\nFirst to note is the vocals of James LaBrie. This was his first album with the band after Charlie Dominici's departure. Whereas Dominici had a stellar voice but couldn't match his style with the band, LaBrie's range and majesty made his voice nearly synonymous with the band. Whether it's his fast-paced aggressive verses leading to a high-powered scream in Take the Time or his hushed voice in Wait for Sleep and Another Day, his tenor does wonders. Kevin Moore's keyboards are stunning and melodic in Metropolis Pt. I and Learning to Live, Mike Portnoy's drumming is both rapid and fluid (not mere background sound like most bands), John Petrucci's riff on Pull Me Under is hypnotic and his solo on Under a Glass Moon is among one of his best. Even the normally silent John Myung shines with his fast-paced and stunning bass solo on Metropolis. \n\nBut musicianship is only successful if properly integrated into each song, and thankfully it is. Each song is unique in its own way and is nearly impossible to slap a genre onto. While a \"progressive metal album\", each song transcends any type of label. Another Day features a soft piano melody with a surprising but fitting saxophone solo and metal guitar riffs. Wait for Sleep is composed entirely of a piano and LaBrie's voice. Surrounded starts off with a quiet keyboard intro before gaining sound with a wailing guitar and bongo-like drums and exploding into a heavy metal riff with a still-prevalent keyboard. Learning to Live is keyboard-heavy and features a Latin-styled acoustic guitar solo. Under a Glass Moon features a strong riff with a light keyboard in the background, followed by Petrucci's stunning solo. Metropolis starts with an angelic keyboard that explodes into a powerful riff and features each member taking the spotlight during the bridge. And the band's biggest hit, Pull Me Under, features a steady riff that doesn't pick up in speed but rather, gains momentum in terms of intensity and power. \n\nThe lyrics of the album truly stand out as well. Often full of metaphors and symbolism, there is also much emotion and energy carried out by LaBrie. Pull Me Under takes the point of view of Shakespeare's Hamlet, Metropolis Pt. I tells the beginning of a story about love and murder (further explained in the the album Metropolis II: Scenes from a Memory), and Surrounded concerns leaving a world of darkness and embracing the light. The only downside I can possibly think of is that with such frequent symbolism, it can be difficult to understand the meaning of the song. On the upside though, it inspires and encourages one to think and determnine their own explanation. \n\nEach song on this album is excellent. With five of the eight tracks over seven minutes long, the songs often change tempo or melody midway, often in the bridge. This is a style Dream Theater has been known for and has allowed them to be at their most creative, but sometimes the melody before was so captivating and entertaining that I sometimes didn't want it to change. But this a very, very insignificant gripe, as the songs changing up really show the band's creativity and musicianship, as I mentioned before. Songs like Another Day and Wait for Sleep may not have captivated me as much as Pull Me Under, Metropolis Pt. I, or Under a Glass Moon, but they are by no means uncreative, boring, or bad in any way. \n\nThis is Dream Theater at their deepest and most emotional, resulting in their finest work. Words can hardly describe what the band did here, and one truly has to hear it for themselves. This is not just one of the best progressive metal albums or even one of the best metal albums, but rather, one of the best albums of all time. No matter how many times you listen, it never gets repetitive, and there's always something new to hear or pick up on. This is a masterpiece that can never or will ever be duplicated.\n",
        "\nSo Dream Theater is back with their 6th output, which incidentally is a double CD album. Being a double album it is expected to be unnaturally long, and so it is containing over 90 minutes of Music. Also looking at the track list it is seen that the second disk contains just the title track which is nearly 42 minutes long divided into 8 parts a la Fates Warning A Pleasant Shade Of Grey.\n\nAs in a Dream Theater record, the technical performances of Mike Portnoy, Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci are amazing. There is lot of technical wankery to be found here from the endless solos in the opener to the piano solos in about to crash. Mike Portnoy is tight in is kit as ever and we never once hear a sloppy performance from him. Unfortunately the bass isn't heard too much on this album except some solos and John Myung is again underused here considering how great bass player he is. Kevin James Labrie's performance in this album gives the worst performances in his career so far a run for their money. Hell they have even sampled his voice on many tracks. Not that it was his fault entirely, but he really sounds crap in the album, which is a major drawback of it. \n\nSo by now everyone and their dog must have heard how a Dream Theater album sounds like, so be prepared for useless technical wankery to the 9th degree. All the songs are nearly ten minutes or above and with poor quality composition you really can't expect this album to rule. So we start the album with an attmpted thrash-prog song in the form of Glass Prison, but the opening riffs remind me more of Pantera rather than Kreator. The vocals suck hard. Why the hell counldn't Labrie sing in his normal Images And Words vocal style? Why does he have to use those raspy vcals which sounds totally hideous? The showoff behind the kit was definitely not enough for Portnoy so here he steps in to do backing vocal duty in the form of death growls which sound more like the Linkin' Park rapper rather than Chuck Shuldiner. The attempted thrash break is full of Machine Heads and Lamb Of Gods rather than Slayers. Blind Faith is much better. It is a fairly good composition with good transition between the heavy and softer parts. It starts slowly and builts up speed towards the end. Misunderstood is attempt at balladry and not a bad one, but oerlong. The Great Debate is again an attempt at sounding heavy and I might add another wastage of 13 minutes. Dissapear is the shortest song from the album. It is dark, deppressing and very moody but very effective and works as the highlight of the album along with Blind Faith (But both of the songs would have been B-sides on Awake). \n\nThen we move on the title track which is I already discussed 42 minutes long. Creating such a long song Dream Theater managed to trick their fans into thinking that they have created something awesome when in reality the song is mediocre to the core. The song is divided into 8 parts which actually are 8 unrelated hideous songs joined together by mediocre orchestrations. Nearly 13 minutes are wasted on useless intros and outros. Among the remainnig parts, only 7 minutes are actually good and heavy. The rest contain shit balladry and useless technical wankery. The song constructon is crap and the parts don't flow into each other as they did in a certain Fates Warning or Manowar song. The lyrics are vomit inducing and totally unrelated with each other. Now conside the line \"She was praised as the perfect teenage girl And everyone thought highly of her\". And Dream Theater call themselves metal writing lyrics like this? The music is so sissy that I doubt the kind of audience this was meant to target. \n\nSo as expected this album contains less ideas than the sum of it's parts. Whatever good ideas are present they are blown away either by Portnoy-Rudess-Petrucci's \"look how many fills and notes I can cram in 1 minute\" showoff or by serious faults in composition. Technical performances are just superb in this album but what wanted is intelligent composition and songwriting. Yeah I agree that the guys in DT are no Hansie Kursch or Tonny Iommy but yeah they can write a good tune or couple to save their ass if they can't help it. Awake need I say more? That album was an excellent display of this band's powers when they are put in good use. I really feel sorry writing such a negative review as this is a very talented band the guys know how to play their games seriously. But if only they leave aside their \"see how technically adept musician I am\" showmanship and concentrate on writing songs which are meant to be enjoyed by the listeners like they did way back during the days of Awake, this could have been something very different. So finally, stay away from the album, it will cause huge turbulence in you.\n",
        "\nWhen I first listened to this album I thought that it was a good album but the more I listened to it, the more I took the time to discover it attentively, the more I realized that this is somewhat the underrated gem in the discography of the most important progressive metal band of all times. This album is a truly progressive album and has something of a modern version of a classical symphony. A Beethoven or Wagner could not have created something more epic and diversified than Dream Theater create not only in the outstanding title track but also in some parts of the other parts that do not have the same level of \u201cepic sound\u201d and greatness but that are brilliantly executed and at least very good too.\n\n\"The glass prison\" is the first part of another famous epic masterpiece of Dream Theater, the twelve-step suite. This modern, surprisingly fast and heavy song is one of the best parts of this epic conceptual track that would be followed by four other tracks on the next albums. The sound effects are very interesting and progressive and especially the keyboards do a certainly great job here. The only problem with this song is that it gets somewhat lost in its own heaviness and lacks of creating a melodic chorus, a truly catchy riff or other memorable moments. That's why this song is good or at some point even very good. But it isn\u2019t an outstanding one. But as I said, it is a promising and highly entertaining beginning of a new saga.\n\nThe second track \"Blind faith\" is smoother than the opener and surprises with a very atmospheric and relaxing introduction. Especially the keyboards do once again an outstanding job on this track and create exotic folk sounds. Sadly, this calm song goes somehow nowhere after a very promising beginning and lacks of a catchy or epic chorus or some surprising breaks. The intro and outro are great but the middle part is only of an average quality and somewhat boring and that's why this track is the weakest one on the whole record.\n\nThe third song is called \"Misunderstood\" and is a sleepy, smooth and soft ballad that surprises with a weird guitar technique where a solo is reversed and creates a very eerie and addicting effect. Another strong point is once again the keyboard work and one must admit that this album is probably Jordan Rudess' masterpiece. All in all, this calm track is a song that grows more and more as time goes by even though it could maybe have been cut down a little bit and has a couple of lengths. \n\n\"The great debate\" is a conceptual song with highly interesting lyrics. It starts with a very progressive intro where a debate is hold and different sound patterns and collages from speeches and interviews are included. The song surprises with a stunning drumming by Mike Portnoy who is delivering an amazing job. The once again great keyboard effects and strange vocal effects give this song a somewhat modern, progressive and apocalyptical touch and surprise us again and again. That's why this song is able to maintain the tension and be highly interesting until the very end. \n\nThe last song from the first disc is called \"Disappear\" and is a calm track with a somewhat eerie atmosphere because of a very spacey intro and an as amazing outro. The keyboards once again carry this song as well as the very touching lyrics. The monotone and repeating middle part fits to the sensitive and sad topic and I wouldn't see this as a negative point even though this song is obviously not as addicting as the previous one. \n\nAnd then comes the title track, a masterpiece with a length of forty-two minutes and not one single minute of this symphony is boring or unnecessary. There are so many changes and emotions in this epic song that almost works like a movie or at least as a movie score that it would be way too long to describe everything that happens in the eight different parts of the song. The orchestration is great and almost sounds like if a true orchestra was playing. This shows once again what an amazing job especially Jordan Rudess does on this whole record. The live version on the \"Score\" album with a true orchestra is even more intense than this one. Lyrics and music perfectly fit together and it is an amazing pleasure to go for a ride on this epic journey and voyage through the highly interesting minds of six degrees of inner turbulence. Each different part of the song has a very special mood that fits to the concerned turbulence and creates images and ideas in our minds. This is like cinema for your ears. If I had to chose one single song to represent the band Dream Theater to someone I would pick this epic track or the easier to listen to first part of \"Metropolis\" because of its rather short length. This song is maybe the opus magnum of Dream Theater and not just one of many superb epic tracks. If you are a fan of Dream Theater and don't have this album yet, you should correct this lack right now and you surely won't regret to buy this intellectual masterpiece.\n\nTo keep it short, you get delivered one unforgettable and outstanding masterpiece, two extremely strong tracks, two good ones and only one weaker track on the whole record. Just the title track is worth buying this album. In my opinion this is one of their best records ever. It grows more and more every time you listen to it and has to be at least in my top five albums of Dream Theater even if I was sceptical in the beginning. So, if you truly admire the band in general, it is simply impossible to dislike this record. And this record may even please to people that are no metal heads but fans of progressive rock, krautrock, classical symphonies or operas. This is a great album for anyone that is able to take its time to listen to and appreciate music. Let me formulate it like this: Glory to the patient ones as they will truly live an adorable experience by listening to this record that slowly becomes one of my favourite ones of Dream Theater.\n",
        "\nAfter a very smooth and calm record called \"Octavarium\" Dream Theater tried out something new again on this new record. They were looking for a more technical approach, sounded very modern and also diversified on this album and concetrated more on a heavier approach than the stuff they had just done before.\n\nThe epic \"In the presence of enemies\" that is separated in two parts for no obvious reason at all shows us a typical, very technical but not very outstanding or fresh epic track that has its moments, especially concerning the introduction and the solo parts of the second part. But many times, the same vocal lines and main riffs come back and are only interrupted by smooth ballad passages and a few strange sound effects so that this song becomes very difficult and sometimes boring to listen to within more than twenty-five minutes. This song is finally one of the less convincing epic Dream Theater tracks.\n\nNow, what can we find between the two parts of this overlong average epic song? We can find teh usual ballad and commercial track with \"Forsaken\" that has a little gothic touch and a catchy chorus but nothing outstanding and ha sto go down as a quite weak track. \"Constant motion\" sounds like a more technical rip off of a Metallica song. Dream Theater goes Thrash Metal but not in an original way like on some parts of \"Train of thought\". This song feels misplaced and even though it is a catchy and energizing track this just doesn't fit to the band's style and Metallica have also done some better songs like these back in the late eighties. So this is another song below average. \n\n\"The dark eternal night\" is a very modern and technical song with weird vocal sound effects, a rather epic chorus and some very simple lyrics and harsh riffs. This song shows us a completely new side of Dream Theater's universe and doesn't copy any band or any style and that's why this song is at least outstanding. Personally, I like the style of this song even if it is a very particular one. It is definitively the highlight of this record for me even though traditional fans might have some problems with this experience.\n\nBut then comes \"Repentance\" where Dream Theater would like to sound like Opeth. This song is just too long, too boring and without the glimpse of a doubt the weakest part of the famous twelve-step suite. The idea of mumbling voices of different well known artists in the ending of the song to create a strange sound collage is original but executed in a rather bad way as this passage gets very long and annoying. After a Metallica and an Opeth rip off comes now a Muse rip off. Some parts of the previous album \"Octavarium\" had already been influenced by this band but this track seems to be entirely copied from the promising English prog rock band that also gained commercial success. But Dream Theater are not Muse and even though they almost sound like the original and create an appreciable song without a doubt the song has the mood of an unoriginal copy and doesn't have exactly the same kind of magic Muse are used to put in their songs and that's why \"Prophets of war\" ultimately fails. \"The ministry of lost souls\" is finally a rather traditional Dream Theater song and has surely some musically interesting parts but it is way too long with a length of almost fifteen minutes and seems somehow endless to me.\n\nTo conclude, this album is Dream Theater's most unoriginal one. It is somewhat a homage to their different influences. It is a very modern record where the band shows its technical skills but forgets to create something unique they were always used to create on all their records. And that's why this album is probably the band's weakest one. This record has the mood of a compilation album without an own soul and that's why it ultimately fails. This is a chaos without any rationally appreciable system.\n",
        "\nThis is the album where Dream Theater tries to forge its power of the tranquility that most of the songs inhabit. \n\nOf course, there are a few exceptions, for example the opener and part of the famous twelve-step suite \"The root of all evil\" to mention a good example, a complex and difficult opener that becomes more interesting and addicting the more you listen to it and the more you are able to see it in the context with its other parts. \"Panic attack\" is also an exception and a very hectical and annoying track that is technically amazing but musically crushing every head and a rather negative example. Everything is played fast and in a very low tuned agressivity and terrible vocal sound effects make the whole thing sound very artificial, technical as if a robot was singing. I really don't like this experience.\n\nConcerning the smoother songs, there are at first hand the ballads \"The answer lies within\" and \"I walk beside you\" that are dominated by keyboards, smooth guitars and the calm vocals but those tracks don't show anything new or interesting and never reach the level of older ballads like the magic \"Surrounded\" and eventually fail. The first track is extremely smooth and at least fits to the general atmosphere of this album but it sounds rather like a \"Evanescence\" pop song meets the aesthetic boredom of a weaker \"Awake\" rip off. It's a song I normally skip on this record because it makes me disconnect or fall asleep after a very strong opener. \"I walk beside you\" sounds like if Bon Jovi met U2 so purist metalheads should be warned right now. This songs is interesting but nothing more than an average experimental track. \"These walls\" is another rather smooth songs with a very strange introduction that fits to the style of the album but doesn't have anything surprising to be truly recognized or kept in mind eventually. It really seems that Dream Theater wanted to try out something completely different once againa fter the surprising and heavier \"Train of thought\" and from that perspective they have truly succeeded and added another element or piece of style to their diversified universe. \n\n\"Never enough\" sounds like \"Muse\" meets \"Tool\" and has smoother and harder parts but lacks of an own addicting identity. It is the only song that neither fits to the rest of the album and its two different styles and seems misplaced and lost. It would have found a better place on the \"systematic chaos\" record in my opinion. This song is surely not a bad one even if it is not groundbreaking but goes somehow under on this album and feels like a disturbing piece that doesn't fit into the whole puzzle. \n\nLet's now talk about the two tracks that are really strong and dominating this album. Those two songs make this album worth to be listened to because the other tracks are all disturbingly weak and often even not of an average quality. Those two songs, the last ones of the album called \"Sacrified sons\" and \"Octavarium\" save this album from being the band's worst offering ever. What a chance that those two songs last over more than half an hour and that means that at least half of the music on thsi record is very good if you only take a look on the length. \"Sacrified sons\" begins with a very cinematic and weird introduction that goes over to a very smooth and calm melody that fits to the overall style and appearence of the record. The guitars sound very experimental, dreamy and eerie during the calm introduction while the chorus is harmonic and peaceful. This track slowly elaborates a feeling of smooth magic like the band was used to do so on the better moments on \"Awake\". After a while, the songs gets a little bit faster and the instruments proove their talent in various solos and surprising breaks without losing its epicness. The title track \"Octavarium\" is than a smooth and experimental masterpiece of tranquility where Tangerine Dream meets Genesis meets King Crimson. Just lay down, close your eyes, listen and dream or fly far away as this song creates magic moments and shows us the true quintessence of this album. Especially the keyboards and guitars sound as if they were from another world with there weird effects that create a new kind of sensations that Dream Theater haven't explored before. The smooth orchestrations like violins, violas, cellos, flutes and french horns that ahve already been used in \"Sacrified sons\" but that were less present in the overall sound add now something new to the musical universe and harmonize with the usual instruments and overall songwriting. Of course you have to be patient with this long masterpiece and it won't be easy for every metalhead to attentively listen to such a calm song for twenty-four minutes. But once you get used to this style, you will surely appreciate this epic piece of tranquility with its smooth changes and floating rhythms that are completely different from what he have been used to with songs like \"In the name of god\" from the last records.\n\nBut sadly the last two great songs can not let us forget the weaker six first songs that are rarely convincing and consistent. \"Panic attack\" and \"The answer lies within\" on teh other hand are maybe among the worst songs the band has ever written. And that's why I can't give a very high rating to this album and must give you the advice to be really patient and open-minded to appreciate this record and that you may really admire it you more you listen to it.\n",
        "\nDream Theater have always been known as a band that likes to try out something new. I liked the calm progressive rock of the early days as much as the previous conceptual progressive metal epics. \"Train of thought\" continues the line of this diversity of styles and is an album that surprises with a very dark atmosphere, a very modern and clinical sound, some really heavy riffs that create a pendulum between pure Thrash Metal and the so-called Nu Metal and from fast rapping parts to sweet and calm cello interludes that are dominated by some keyboards, we get a lot of new things with this record. Purist and traditional metalheads beware, the band uses evil \"modern\" influences and \"untrue\" styles and has decided not to do an \"Awake II\" or \"Metropolis Part III\". And while many closed minded people will largely discuss about what happened to the band and how they could have ever done such a record, I appreciate the band's courage and I am truly happy to see and hear that they are still trying out something new and trfying to truly progress and innovate their genre where other bands of their kind like \"Symphony X\" or \"Spock's Beard\" deliver very solid albums without a doubt but somehow the usual material for the usual masses. With \"Train of thought\" Dream Theater take the risk to lose some old fans but get also the possibility to attract some new fans, especially younger persons that listen to commercial Nu Metal or fans of harder metal genres that always thought that the band was too soft. But in a fascinating way, the album doesn't sound as if the band had tried at all costs to please to those people or to follow a trend, it all sounds very natural and certainly fresh.\n\nAnd while there are some electronical sound samples, some rap passages, some more vocal passages by Mike Portnoy and some heavy and straight riffs, the traditional fans may be happy to hear that this album still delivers us some excellent guitar solos (\"Honour thy father\"), some very calm and epic moments where James LaBrie creates magic moments with his soft voice surrounded by the keyboards (\"Vacant\") and some exotic elements and addicting melodies where every contributing instrument is extremely well executed (\"In the name of god\"). There are a lot of new elements but the band doesn't quite forget its roots and combines both influences. The more you listen over and over again to the songs, the more gems and surprises you discover such as the mumbles on \"Honour thy father\" that are taken from two movies or the famous morse code and parts of the American civil war hymn on the diversified masterpiece \"In the name of god\". Every single song on this record keeps some very emotional and addicting instrumental passages and there is no single filler on the record. The only slightly negative point that I can find is that some songs could have been cutten down a few minutes for example the solos or the outro on \"Endless sacrifice\" or the repeating parts in the stunning instrumental \"Stream of consciounceness\" that unites experimental passages with a catchy main riff. \n\nWith a liitle bit more consistence and concentration, this album could have been the best one in the band's discography because it is courageous, fresh and still addicting and combines a new sound to the typical trademarks in a very open-minded way. I would only put the very diversified killer album \"Black clouds and silver linings\" above this one. But progressive rock or metal fans should be warned and give this album a try before they buy it because the usually quite soft and traditional band sounds very modern and heavy on this album and reminds us rather of Mudvayne or Korn than of Rush and Iron Maiden. This is an album for open-minded friends of dark and proggy heaviness.\n",
        "\nThis album is one of the rare albums that added nothing new to the sound and universe of Dream Theater. They have tried it all: Soft and dreamy progressive rock pearls like on \"Images and words\", complexe conceptual structures like on \"Scenes from a memory\", very dark heavy and thrash metal epics like on \"Train of thought\", silent and orchestral progressive metal like on \"Octavarium\" and rather modern stuff like on \"Systematic chaos\". Now, \"Black clouds and silver linings\" reunites all of this in a single whole album, leaves us the unnecessary and watering parts and simply presents the stunning quintessence of the band's philosophy. To keep it simple, this album is far away from being original or surprising but it is simply the most consistent and in my opinion best album this band has ever made. If you are a newbie and interested in the band's works you should take this album as an introduction and a greatest hits compilation at the same time.\n\n\"A nightmare to remember\" is a very dark and atmospheric killer that opens the album on a very depressive mood that sends shivers down my spine. The nightmare is immediatly present and this songs makes you living it in all its high paced emotions and rare moments of tranquility. It is maybe the most addicting and intensive song the band has ever written and is a voyage to the core of your deep hidden emotions. This is better than cinema and the sixteen minutes pass extremely fast so don't be afraid to begin the album by watching the track's running time. You will highly appreciate every minute of this epic masterpiece that mixes styles from the dark \"Train of thought\" with the epic mood of a \"Octavarium\".\n\n\"A rite of passage\" is the addicting single that comes along with oriental and very atmospheric keyboard and guitar sounds and a highly addicting and epic chorus. This song is like a \"Innocence faded\" meets \"As I am\" meets \"Constant motion\" but still has a very unique approach with its Oriental influence sthat remind me of \"Home\". Useless to say that the guitar and keyboard solos are fast, melodic, addicting, diversified and well executed.\n\n\"Wither\" is the ballad of the album and this time it is a rather dark and atmospheric song and not a commercial piece of kitsch. This very melancholic and dreamy song reminds me of \"Surrounded\", \"Vacant\" or \"Forsaken\". James LaBrie is doing an excellent job and his voice perfectly harmonizes with the dark but soft melodies.\n\n\"The shattered fortress\" is the last part of Mike Portnoy's famous Twele-step Suite or Alcoholics Anonymous Suite. This songs reunites passages from all other four songs before (\"The glass prison\", \"This dying soul\", \"The root of all evil\", \"Repentance\") and adds a couple of few new melodies. Some people may say that this song only repeats the previous tracks but I would rather say that this song is a perfect conclusion and resumee to the whole topic and makes us voyage on the waves of space and time forwards and backwards to remind a let us live again what we have heard before. I see this track as a grand finale to a unique and highly interesting suite and experience in the universe of the progressive metal music.\n\n\"The best of times\" is dedicated to Mike Portnoy's father that died soon before the release of this album. His son had still found the moment to play this song to his dying father with his own vocals. This version is even more intense and touching than the actual album version with James LaBrie on the vocals. The lyrics are very insightful and interesting. Musically, this song has a strong progressive rock touch and reminds a lot of Genesis and especially \"Rush\". The guitar leads and harmonies have a strong late seventies or early eighties touch and this song might also please to people that normally rather avoid Dream Theater because it really has a different approach that has nothing to do with metal but with pure rock music.\n\n\"The count of Tuscany\" is a stunning and epic piece that tells us a disturbing and weird story. Musically, the song takes its power out of its tranquility and reminds me of the silent moments of a \"Octavarium\" or \"Space-dye west\". This song is mysteriously floating through wind and wuthering and is really addicting and relaxing. I would give King Crimson's \"In the court of the crimson king\" or Genesis' \"Wind and wuthering\" as references to this sound. The track also has some nightmare passages like this album opener and a strong chorus but really focusses on an eerie and quiet atmosphere where especially the keyboards do an amazing job. This song is a perfect and calm album closener without being an ordinary ballad. Together with \"A nightamre to remember\", this track is my favourite one of this record and in the top five of my favourite Dream Theater tracks of all times.\n\nAll in all, this is an intense, atmospheric and diversified masterpiece and a perfect last album for Mike Portnoy that has parted ways with the band now and who left with two extremely strong tracks to finish his epic Twelve-step suite and to honour his own father. I think that this is the opus magnum, the masterpiece, the maximum that this band is able to do. But I am ready to see and listen what they are working on for the near future and if they try out something new or try to copy and follow the compilation sound of this grand resumee. To keep it short: Get this record if you love atmospheric music and if you are ready to take your time to get addicted and hypnotized by music to be ready for a voyage of the grandest kind.\n",
        "\nDream Theater's label destroyed their plans and made out of a promising record a mostly cheesy and commercial trash called \"Falling into infinity\". Now, with a new label and a new record the band put a lot of ideas they had for the last record and had to dismiss into this album. Instead of just completing and rerecording their brilliant second part of Metropolis, they decided to create a whole record around this topic and simply called the album \"Metropolis part II: Scenes from a memory\". \n\nI think that the whole album doesn't entirely have the magic of the first part of \"Metropolis\". I must also admit that I really enjoyed the promising demo version of \"Metropolis 2\" and would have prefered this one to a whole album about the topic. There are a few weaker tracks on this record, especially the ballads and more quiet songs like \"Through her eyes\" in the beginning of the album. But this album is still in my ranking of the five best Dream Theater records and even in my top three albums of the band.\n\nNow, let me explain you why. First of all, I think that the whole concept is interesting, well elaborated and sounds somewhat like a modern progressive conceptual album in the key of a \"Operation: Mindcrime\" by Queensryche. The lyrics and the story are really addicting and easily create images or ideas in my head. Second, this album is quite diversified and contains somehow the quintessence of what Dream Theater is able to achieve. Soft ballads with dreamy keyboard sounds and soft and smooth vocals (\"Fatal tragedy\"), epic progressive tunes with many surprising changes like spoken word passages, epic solos or jazz interludes (\"Finally free\") and fast and yet very well developed rockers (\"Beyond this life\") can be found on this record but because of the cinematic story line, all those songs are well and logically connected and create something consistent. That's why this album has a flow that the last two records before this one didn't have. Third, I really admired the first part of \"Metropolis\" which is probably my favourite Dream Theater song of all times and I was particulary happy to hear some elements of that classic in songs such as the atmospheric instrumental introduction \"Overture 1928\", the very progressive instrumental \"The dance of eternity\" that even has some jazz influences or the amazing \"Home\" that is the best song Mike Portnoy has ever written for the band and that surprises with a strong riff and some exotic Asian folklore influences. This track is one of my favourite Dream Theater tracks of all time along with \"Metropolis Part I\" and \"A nightmare to remember\". This epic and inspiring masterpiece \"Home\" is an important turning point on the record because there are only amazingly strong songs after this one in the second act while there were a couple of a little bit overlong and uninspired tracks in the first act. The track \"Home\" can be described as the core or the heart of this record as the band put all its energy and creativity into this song that is able to be interesting and diversified over ten minutes long. \n\nIf Dream Theater ever had a weak point, than it would be the singer James LaBrie that is delivering \"only\" a good job on this record while the musicians create magic moments and show all of their talent throughout the whole record. That's maybe why especially the instrumental tracks are amazing and memorable on this record while the quiet ballads that focus more on James LaBrie only seem like some rather boring breaks between brilliant instrumental sections to me to elaborate the story and background of this opus magnum. The story plays a very important role on this record and it is really a well elaborated, addicting and intellectual story that the band worked out but all of this is nothing in comparison to the brilliantly shining musical performances on the record. That's why this record is as well brilliant for more intellectual listeners that attentively read the booklet as well as for the typical fans of progressive music that just close their eyes and listen to minute long guitar solos, vibrating bass lines, tribal drum loops or exotic and folkish keyboard sounds. This album is clearly nothing for a metalhead that awaits some straight, heavy and easily addicting tracks like the band created later on the heavier and darker \"Train of thoughts\".\n\nIt is a very entertaining and stunning experience to listen to this album which I consider as a modern progressive metal masterpiece. Anyone that liked the first part of Metropolis\" will admire and must have this record. The first part was like a brilliant preview and this new album is now like the complete movie and this is a blockbuster of modern progressive metal. It begins rather slow paced after a bombastic introduction with some soft fillers before the tension rises and leads us towards a stunning finish. That's why I can really recommand this album to anyone that likes conceptual albums or progressive rock or metal music but not blindly to the masses.\n",
        "\nThis album could have been a masterpiece of progressive music as I listened to the original version of the epic \"You or me\" that was reduced to a short single by the label with the help of Desmond Child. The album was intended as a double album including a brilliant second part of \"Metropolis\" with a length of more than twenty minutes and thsi excellent demo can still be found and ordered at Ytse Jam Records or simply found on the internet. But this new album now mostly tries to continue the silent and calm style of \"Awake\" with a more commercial approach. Faceless ballads like \"Peruvian skies\", \"Hollow years\" or \"Anna Lee\" just bore to death. The mainstream production by the horribly overrated Kevin Shirley is another weak point of this record without guts and experiments. Even the epic \"Trial of tears\" is just an endless suffering and makes me fall asleep. This could have been such a great record but the pressure and conditions at that time made this album one of the worst ones in the band's discography instead. The extremely bad cover artwork adds another minus to this album.\n\nBut there are still a couple of great tracks on this record after all. The straight opener \"New millenium\" or the darker and more atmospheric \"Burning my soul\" as well as the very atmospheric and magic instrumental track \"Hell's kitchen\" that convinces with beautiful guitar leads are some of the hidden masterpieces on this commercial record. My very favourite track is the very progressive \"Lines in the sand\" that has some surprising and amazing Krautrock and electronical influences and strong back vocals by King's X singer Doug Pinnick. This song is extremely diversified, surprising and grows more and more every time I listen to it.\n\nIt's because of those songs that I still like this record and would recommend it to a fan of progressive music and would not vote this album as the band's worst effort and can give at least an average note.\n",
        "\nI don't know what is wrong with me but I don't understand or share the hype about this album. I really liked the very diversified first strike \"When dream and day unite\" and the magic moments on the progressive rock revival masterpiece \"Images and words\" but \"Awake\" is mostly boring, complicated and dull to me. \n\nJust to give you an example, the epic song \"Scarred\" is very diversified but not catchy or addicting for a single second. It lacks the hectical genius of \"Metropolis\" or the touching and profound melodies of \"Surrounded\" or the freshness of \"Only a matter of time\". This track is just long and boring, it has no magic tranquility and no guts either. The often cited \"Space-dye west\" shows us that Kevin Moore has some skills but the intro already rather reminds me of a boring evening in a high society restaurant for rich couples and thsi track never has the same magic as the harmo\u00b4nies he created on \"Surrounded\" or \"The killing hand\". The song is very relaxed and vchilling and surely has a special atmosphere and is a good choice to close an album on a calm note but to me this song is mostly boring and overrated. \"Lifting shadows off a dream\" makes me even faster fall asleep. Normally, I like silent progressive tracks as I am a huge fan of King Crimson but this pop ballad is simply dumb.\n\nThose relaxed songs do not fit with the rather modern and rocking songs like \"Lie\" where James LaBrie sounds like if a disco pop vocalist would try out to do some hard rock or the very rhythm orientated opener \"Six o'clock\" that is one of the rare songs that I really like on this album because every instrument shows its forces in this surprising and very progressive track that unites everything about the band. \n\nBut a part of the diversified and still somewhat straight \"Six o'clock\" and the beautiful \"Innocence faded\" that convinces me with a catchy chorus and beautiful guitar leads that could have been on \"Images and words\", there is no third song on the record which I really adore and that's why I really feel disappointed about this so well received record. \n\nI would even go as far and say that this album is probably the weakest and most boring one in the band's very strong and stunning discography. I would rather listen to the first two albums and recommend those than this overrated boredom in aesthetic perfection.\n",
        "\nThree years after the convincing and very strong first album \"When dream and day unite\", Dream Theater came back with a new vocalist and created a new masterpiece of progressive rock or metal. While this album is maybe not as diversified as the first strike, \"Images and words\" is able to create some really magic moments and has even some very catchy songs.\n\nThe magic moments are presnet on the calm songs of the record like the wonderful ballad \"Another day\" that is brilliantly sung and convinces with some strong piano leads and a soprano saxophone that adds a very special note to the song. \"Surrounded\" is even better with its amazingly harmonic and chilling keyboard sounds and James LaBrie that delivers on of his strongest performances of all times in my opinion.\n\nThe catchiness that was lacking on the last record is now present with the opener \"Pull me under\" that has a very simple but strong chorus and some mystical and exotic rhythms. But to be honest, I think that this track is one of the less profound on the record and is a little bit too long in the ending just to end in a very abrupt and senseless way. \n\nI rather prefer the progressive side of Dream Theater like in the very diversified \"Take the time\" or the interesting \"Learning to live\". But both of the songs are just good average on this record because they share the album with the masterpiece \"Metropolis\", maybe the best song the band has ever written. In almost ten minutes ever instrument gets the place it deserves and everyone is working over the top, beyond all limits to create a very diversified surprising and still logical and atmospheric track. This memorable piece of music unites everything what the band stands for and if I had to present Dream Theater to a good friend with just one single song, then I would chose this masterpiece that isnpired the band to write a whole album around this track a couple of years later.\n\nAll in all, there is not much to argue about this album. It has some magic moments, every musician is doing his very best and the production and sound is more accurate than on the first record. There are a couple of songs that I would rather describe as average tracks that I like less, especially the complicated and somewhat faceless \"Under a glass moon\" or the overrated \"Pull me under\". This album is not as consisant as the underrated debut album and has some other strong points. But on the other hand the band puts two of their best songs ever on this record with the unforgettable \"Surrounded\" and \"Metropolis\" and that's why this album is surely and easily in my top five ranking of the best albums in the band's biography even I would not put this record in the first places. But for any fan of progressive music, this masterpiece that somewhat reanimated a whole genre is a definite must have that offers a lot to discover. I would put the band's first to albums on the same level even though the have all different forces and weak points.\n",
        "\nThis first official studio album by Dream theater and the only one featuring the singer Charlie Dominici is a very strong, soft and dreamy progressive rock record in the key of \"Rush\". There are even some very sligthly disco pop influences in a couple of songs that remind me of Genesis, Europe or Queen, mostly because of the keyboards, the choirs and especially the vocals. I would say that I really like those vocals and think that Dominici has a very unique and catchy voice and is not really worse than James LaBrie even if he doesn't have the same skills as the later singer. What I really adore about this album are the perfect keyboard sounds that perfectly fit to the progressive rockers and take an important place without being to dominating. Almost every song has some brilliant and catchy keyboard sections. Most people say that Kevin Moore did his masterpieces on \"Awake\" but I think that he already created them on \"When dream and day unite\" or \"Images and words\". Especially the intro of the brilliant epic \"Only a matter of time\" is amazing and memorable.\n\nThe only negative points about the album are that the band has not yet found a quite unique style and copies a lot its idols and legends and the fact that a true catchy masterpiece is still missing on this album. The mediocre sound quality and production of this record is probably a negative point for the purists and progressive music maniacs but I think that it gives a certain early eighties charm to this record.\n\nThe band already shows its brilliant musical talent in th very surprising opener \"A fortune in lies\" that has changes in rhythm and style all the time but is able to sound consistant. The rhythm section with bass a nd drums is doing a very well job on this first track. \n\nOne of the greatest songs is the band's first epic track \"The killing hand\" that could have found a place on \"Operation: Mindcrime\" by Queensryche with its very slow harmonies in the beginning and softly high pitched voice that tells us a complex story. I really like the fast keyboard solo and the quiet passages that always come back and build the core of the whole progressive structure that meanders all the time. But the other epic \"Only a matter of time\" is even greater in my opinion and convinces with perfect keyboard harmonies and logically arranged changes in style. Songs like these two epics take some time to grow and I am just about discovering this first record of Dream Theaer and I am still highly adoring it. There is something fresh and magic about those two epics and the band later realized that they are really talented in creating those complex structures and focused on such material. But they rarely got the same original and charming level of those two early masterpieces.\n\n\"Afterlife\" convinces with an excellent guitar play and proves us already that every musician in the band has special skills. The majestic instrumental song \"The ytse jam\" proves that in splendid colours where every instruments gets the right place and time to elaborate some very progressive rhythms and sounds.\n\nTo conclude, this album is the first but by far not the worst record by Dream Theater but maybe one of their most original and simply best albums. This album grows more and more on me and I would put it definitely in my top 5 of the band's discography. Many people discover this album quite lately because it is not as often and easy to find than the other works and be\u00b4cause some people don't seem to trust another vocalist than James LaBrie and that's a shame because this is a very strong and diversified album that I would recommend to any fan of progressive rock or metal.\n",
        "\nThis strikes me as somewhat of an odd Iron Maiden song for Dream Theater to cover. While it\u2019s certainly epic and progressive, it lacks the sort of bombastic majesty that Dream Theater usually aims for. Indeed this track feels a great deal slower than it should be, and when it does pick up the pace it still doesn\u2019t feel like it ends on at a climatic moment. Most of this is the fault of the original song, which is by far down the weakest epic of the classic Iron Maiden catalogue. I suppose that the band had their hands tied on the selection of the song as it was recorded for a Kerrang compilation and some assholes called Madina Lake got to \u201cCaught Somewhere In Time\u201d first. Oh well, you have to make due with what you have right?\n\nThis is not to say that the song is bad. It\u2019s still a classic Maiden composition, and Petrucci and the gang do a good job adding their own spin to it. The sitar effect during the verses is a nice touch in particular, pushing science fiction atmosphere to the fore front in a way that Iron Maiden themselves would have done if the song had been on \u201cSomewhere In Time\u201d rather than \u201cPiece of Mind\u201d. John Myung is clearly enjoying his day in the sun as well, as he matches Steve Harris\u2019s signature driving bass perfectly. If nothing else, this cover shows yet again that Dream Theater are damn good replicators.\n\nMuch like the Rainbow cover, the main problem with this recording is James LaBrie\u2019s voice. Not only does LaBrie\u2019s nasal whine get in the way of the vocal melody, but there also appears to be a heavy amount of distortion and reverb on his voice that completely screws up the atmosphere. I would wager that this cover was recorded at a much faster pace than the rest of the collection, and that the band subsequently settled for vocal takes far below than their usually standard. Then again, given LaBrie\u2019s similar failure to deliver on \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d cover album, perhaps singing Iron Maiden is just not in the cards for the Canadian. It\u2019s shame because the rest of the band picks up a large number of their instrument tricks from the classic Maiden era.\n\nCase in point: The best section of this song is the instrumental second half. Here John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess are free to play off each other while John Myung and Mike Portnoy drive at a tempo more fitting their playing style. The guitar and keyboard solos aren\u2019t as evocative and memorable as the originals, but that would be asking an awful lot wouldn\u2019t it?\n\nI suppose the answer to that question really determines how much you\u2019ll like this. If you live and die on Eddie\u2019s command, this cover probably won\u2019t satisfy you. The same goes for the casual Dream Theater. However, if you\u2019re into the novelty of one long running heavy metal band covering another, this is worth a listen.\n",
        "\nWhenever I thought about Live at the Marquee I would say \"Hey, it's only six songs, it can't be that good\". Of course, I though that way maybe because I expected more from a live album, and even much more knowing that it is not any random band, but we're talking about prog gods Dream Theater here, recalling that they have 3 hour-long setlists. If you think properly about this, all this information may be correct, but you're forgetting something. Dream Theater was a really young band back then in the '93, and even being as famous as they were for their acknowledged single, Pull Me Under, they still had a long way to go. Now, since I've recently entered deeply into the early Dream Theater world (not that I wasn't there before, but I just wanted to know more), I decided to get Live at the Marquee and see what it was all about. I found myself much more trapped withing the sound of this than I ever thought I would be. \n\nDream Theater has always kept the intention of playing perfectly live. Here on Live at the Marquee they had not yet reached to the point where adding extra pieces (or \"improvisations\", as they are wrongly called nowadays) to the songs, but instead they tried to play the songs properly, identically to the ones on the album. The only one to differ in these standards was James LaBrie, whose case I will explain later on. The mixing of this live album helps a lot in the replication of the studio version of the songs. Every instrument, just like on the albums, which by the date were only two, stands out as much as the others. I especially like the fact that there are When Dream and Day Unite songs in here, since those are pretty uncommon these days and, besides this, they are sang by James LaBrie instead of Charlie Dominici and their sound quality (believe it or not) is better than the one from the studio versions of the songs. They also added Another Hand to make a variation on The Killing Hand's intro. As much as I like The Killing Hand's original version, Another Hand makes it even better and propels the listener to keep listening to the song. It was also a step up to the \"extra pieces\" that they add more than commonly now.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Dream Theater was a very young band back then. Regardless of this, they have always been virtuosos on their instruments, every single one of them. One of the most outstanding things of Live at the Marquee is James LaBrie. If you have seen any recent live performances by them, it is easy to notice how much his voice has changed. On Live at the Marquee, LaBrie's voice is intendedly powerful, wide-ranged and perfectly managed and really in-tune with the songs. He by no means lets his skills be overshadowed by other elements in the music and in fact does his best effort here. If you listen to Metropolis in here, he has that uncommon grip on his voice, and at the same time he lets his range go out as high as it can, even singing out a F#5 in mid-verse. That's only a slight proof of how good he did in here. Kevin Moore, ex-keyboardist of the band, was also in here. He, unlike Rudess, makes the songs sound more similar to their album versions, for he is the one to have the original patches of the songs and he doesn't add improvisations to the songs. For comprehension, listen to Live at Budokan's Pull Me Under and this album's version of Pull Me Under.\n\nOther than that we have John Myung, John Petrucci and ex-drummer Mike Portnoy. They, as usual, try to play the songs perfectly while adding their unique touch to the music. The most outstanding track for the three of them and Moore is Bombay Vindaloo, a song that is unique for this album. Petrucci gets the spotlight fully on him in this song, doing some awesome fast and sensefull solos, while Myung shows off his bass playing technique more in the intro with some bass harmonics and such. The song has basically this harmonic minor (or Egyptian-like) sound to it, but it is utterly enjoyable. It is mostly pretty calm, with some string backups by Moore and a common, yet at times progressive drumming from Portnoy. The solos' work in every other song was great, they were performed identically to the album versions but they still have the crisp of a live presentation. \n\nSo yeah, six songs only. The reason for liking this album so much is the perfection of how those six songs are performed, the energy of the audience and the outstanding power in LaBrie's vocals. I think this is a true \"must\" for every single Dream Theater fan, so if you don't have it try to check it out.\n",
        "\nAny artist or band playing any kind of music, metal or not, that's progressive in the sense that it's not revolutionary but focuses on altering time, key, and other aspects of theory within individual pieces of music, is an acquired taste. Very few people find themselves getting into progressive metal from the outright. Often times it can take people a rather long time to get into such bands. For me, I was one of these people and Dream Theater was no exception. I admired the band's individual members for their prowess, but in a time when I was saw caught up in the heaviness of metal, I didn't have patience to hear Dream Theater's progressive brand of metal. But after listening to one album, things really began to click for me when it came to liking Dream Theater. That album was the album that divided the Dream Theater fan-base and has drawn more criticism then any other of their albums. That album was Train of Thought. \n\nWithout Train of Thought there was no way I would be into Dream Theater. While I have since moved onto more bands in the progressive metal genre and acquired other Dream Theater albums that are not as easy to get into, Train of Thought it still one of my favorite albums by any band out there. The combination of extreme instrumental proficiency and progressive but not overly technical song structures still draws me to this album time and time again. Despite the fact that I don't think this is the best Dream Theater album ever, I do think that Train of Thought is an album that needs to be taken as it is; a simpler (by Dream Theater standards) album that shows a decent amount of experimentation by a band that was clearly trying to push the boundaries of their comfort zone. \n\nThe album starts off with As I Am. Right from the beginning, after a dreamy sounding brief keyboard intro, it gets into some seriously bass heavy stuff before emerging into one of the darkest and heaviest Dream Theater riffs I've heard in awhile. Then when the main beat starts up, it asserts Dream Theater's presence before promptly moving on to the lyrical content. The lyrics of this song strike me out, as it was almost like the band predicting how this album would sound to a portion of their fanbase. How ironic. Either way, the song is just the proper length and is composed great. Each transition flows into the other nearly seamlessly, each part catches your ear, and does not feel like seven minute forty eight second song in the least. That to me is huge. One thing I've always appreciated about Dream Theater is their ability to make long sounds not sound so long, and on Train of Thought they do that practically better then any other album out there. \n\nHowever, the album directs a lot of derisive criticism from Dream Theater fans who didn't like the band tried to do something differently. Particularly, more then any other member, most of this criticism is directed at vocalist James Labrie. Now to get it straight, I've never been a huge fan of Labrie. The guy is an acquired taste, and I think that there are better progressive metal vocalists out there then him, but I don't mind his performance on each Dream Theater album. However, Labrie is frequently accused on this album of committing a cardinal sin in heavy metal. If I could stand as an attorney in the heavy metal court in his defense for a moment, James Labrie has been accused by Dream Theater fans for rapping. This could not be farther from the truth. The guy simply sings fast while with a rhythm. I mean serioulsy, is it such a crime that he tries to sing with a rhythm? Is it so bad that for once he tries to sing fast? Honestly no. If he had sang slow on songs where he's accused of rapping, he would've sounded sappy, over dramatic, and generally boring. I mean seriously, you can't tell me that Honor Thy Father would have sounded good if he used any of his traditional vocal patterns, or that the fast part in This Dying Soul would've sounded good doing that instead of the way he sings. That's just not true. While the distortion of those vocals in This Dying Soul makes no sense to me whatsoever and I think it was a failed attempt to cover up the fact that Labrie has a hard time singing \"aggressively\". To me, Labrie has some of the catchiest vocal patterns anywhere in Dream Theater's catalog. For me, someone who's not really a fan of his voice, this makes listening to these songs a lot easier and actually sort of makes him sound better then normal. \n\nThis rapping and the next issue present have led to Dream Theater being accused of playing mallcore throughout the album. The next accusation stems that guitarist John Petrucci's riffs were simply not technical enough and too dumbed down. Well yes, they are simple but these riffs wouldn't work for real mallcore and they are not totally basic. Just because he's playing simple riffs doesn't mean that John's lost any least bit of technicality. The time and key changes he works through on Train of Thought are as impressive as ever, and the guy can still shred his tail off. In fact, this album has some of those most technical and accomplished guitar solos he's ever done on Dream Theater songs. I mean, I knew John could shred from watching his instructional video, but my oh my he takes it to a new level here. As stated before, he does adopt some new guitar techniques here to complement his strengths, most notably sweep picking. His sweeps on the solos of songs like Endless Sacrifice and In the Name of God sound great, and his guitar work is as ripping as ever. \n\nThe other members perform very well. John Myung's bass, ever present under the guitars, keyboards, and drums provides a much necessary bottom and end is as technical and innovative as ever. This is arguably Dream Theater's most bass heavy album, and while there are not any real bass solos on this album, you can tell that Myung provides a huge dimension to Dream Theater's sound that was crucial to these songs sounding so heavy. Mike Portnoy's as proficient as ever on the drums, using all sorts of crazy beats and making good use of both his hands and his feet. Though he isn't incredibly fast, his beats are very well used on this album. Great job by the original Dream Theater drum master. \n\nHere though is where things fall off significantly. Jordan Ruddess's keys are actually rather pushed back on this album. The keys and synths are there but they are not used in songs as much as they are in soloing. One problem I do have with this album is that I feel Jordan did not put on a good performance keyboard wise unless he was in a soloing duel with Petrucci. Most of the synth sounds on Train of Thought just don't sound good at all, being basically simple pop synths and hardly being used in the songs outside of soloing. It is this work that I feel like Ruddess really falls off, as I feel like he should've tried to do more then simply match Petrucci solo for solo. \n\nThe other area to me that the band doesn't perform well in is lyrics. This is the one part of the criticism that I will side with when people said the band sounded like they were a bit mallcore-ish. The lyrics are for the most part covering typical introspective, Dream Theater like topics, but the content is painfully sub-par. This is kind of kicked off right from the beginning with As I Am, where (as stated above) the band asserts itself on the album to it's fans. Good assertion, but it just sounds so weak, especially when James Labrie places emphasis on saying \"fuck\". That's just lame. While I love the premise of Honor Thy Father and I think it's a rather catchy song, the lyrics are totally weak and sound like an angsty teenager in a creative writing class wrote them. Endless Sacrifice sounds like the lyrics were written by Creed or another alt rock band. Vacant is a totally useless filler track with equally useless lyrics. In the Name of God has lyrics that just don't make sense and while I kind of understand what Dream Theater was getting at (the song is about religious extremism and those who try to use religion as an excuse to commit terrorism), they just sound disjointed and weak throughout. Petrucci and Portnoy really didn't do well in the lyrical department on Train of Thought. \n\nThe production of Train of Thought was really well done. I love the way every instrument on this album can be heard without one overpowering one in the least. The guitars sound like guitars and are not swooshy sounding at all, just like how I like them. The solo tone is especially good, with every note sounding crisp and clear and Petrucci's shredding wailing like I've never even heard. John Myung's bass is ever present without the need for separate sections or an excessively ringing tone. Mike's percussion sounds completely equalized, and I especially liked his snare sound on the album and how how the cymbals sound so free and cut through the mix just right. Ruddess's keys can be heard throughout, even if his laid back role means you won't hear them as much as others. Labrie's vocals got a great treatment and sound perfect. \n\nTrain of Thought may be the most divisive album in Dream Theater's entire catalog, but it's a good album in the grand scheme of music and should be the first place anyone trying to get to the band should go to. Dream Theater tried to evolve and explore newer territories of aggression and emotion on this album, and it should be seen by the listener and deserves some appreciation. In the end, this is an album the listener just needs to one thing for. Take it as it is.\n",
        "\n\"Lie\" is one of the heaviest tracks played by Dream Theater (as of 1994, of course wiped out by anything in \"Train of Thought\"). In the past, heaviness wasn't a focus for them, but in \"Awake\" they took this direction. It became accepted and even got called the masterpiece of prog metal. Now, lets see what's up with this single.\n\n\"Lie\" compiles some good stuff. The title track, \"Lie\", is, as mentioned, one of their heaviest tracks. It was composed by Kevin Moore, their ex-keyboardist. There isn't a great standout of the keyboards in here. The passion that LaBrie has on this song while singing is remarkable. Petrucci riffs extremelly heavily and does an amazing solo, backed up by Myung who keeps a steady rhythms while adding heaviness. Portnoy does some nice, progressive drumming with complex rhythms and several tempo changes. \n\nThe other tracks on the single are much slower. These songs are \"Space-Dye Vest\", \"To Live Forever\" and a live version of \"Another Day\". These songs are much more focused on the synth and piano, especially \"Space-Dye Vest\", considered to be Kevin Moore's masterpiece. \"To Live Forever\" is a classic among the fans, it was never released on an album but was played pretty often live. It is much more progressive, relaxing and groovy, with everything in the song being complex with the exception of the time signature. There is a nice solo by Petrucci in here and a unison with Moore. LaBrie isn't a huge highlight, as he sings rather calm. As for the live version of \"Another Day\", it is a great performance. Moore also stands out in here. It was recorded properly and has a good quality.\n\nI wouldn't say this is a must, not even for diehard fans of Dream Theater. Even though the songs are good, I would recommend \"Greatest Hit... and 21 other Really cool songs\" over this, as it has all the songs that appeared in here (except Space-Dye Vest) in a better quality and has even more songs.\n",
        "\nFirst off, you should probably know that I am not an expert on Dream Theater. This was the first album I bought, and then later I got their big Greatest Hit yadda yadda yadda compilation. But the thing I noticed when listening to that compilation was that even on \"The Dark Side,\" a lot of the songs just aren't as heavy as I would prefer, particularly with their older songs. Once it got to the songs from Train of Thought and Octavarium, then it was more what I was looking for. And then on \"The Light Side,\" pretty much all of the songs were way too light for me. (Though I do like \"Solitary Shell.\")\n\nWell, one of the things that I really appreciate about this album is that it's heavy. It gives you four metal songs and two lighter songs, and the lighter songs are both really good compared to most of the lighter songs on their greatest hits compilation. Some people complain that this album isn't progressive enough, but that's something I honestly couldn't care less about. If they shortened up their songs and played in 4/4 the whole time, and stuck with an ABAB format most of the time, I think I would like them just as much. I don't care if it's progressive, as long as it's metal and it's good metal. If you disagree, you might not like this album as much.\n\nI know that we're supposed to avoid track by track reviews on this site, but I think it feels necessary when there are only six very different sounding songs.\n\nA Nightmare to Remember: Great wat to kick off the album. It starts out with some quiet but evil-sounding keyboards, and then some incerdibly heavy guitar riffs blast out of nowhere. Great intro! This song is over 16 minutes long, and the heaviness never lets up. My favorite parts are in the middle of the song when he's in the hospital, and the part where Mike Portnoy does his awesome growls. Some people hate his voice, but I think it gives this band the extra edge that it needs to make it more metal.\n\nA Rite of Passage: This is the first single from the album, and probably my favorite. This is the kind of song that would get a lot of radio play in a perfect world. I love the main guitar riff that gets repeated throughout the song. The chorus is the best part. It gets stuck in my head pretty easily. It's also got a great guitar solo.\n\nWither: This song is lighter and not quite as exciting, but is still a great song. It's relatively short, at only five and a half minutes. The chorus is good, and so are the verses, really. This isn't like some Sonata Arctica or Stratovarius ballad, but it's still really beautiful.\n\nThe Shattered Fortress: This song ends the AA Suite, but of course it was really the beginning for me. This one is heavier and longer. I wasn't the biggest fan of this one at first, but it grew on me and now I absolutely love it. It's just full of great riffs and different sections that are really catchy. It doesn't have your typical pop structure at all, which I suppose made it hard to get into. I think my favorite part is the part that's taken straight out of The Root of All Evil, but I didn't know that when I first heard it. I also like the \"chorus\" at the beginning, the part that starts \"Look in the mirror...\"\n\nThe Best of Times: This is a lighter song again, and is a tribute to Mike Portnoy's father. The intro is annoyingly long. Just three minutes of pointless instruments. After that, it picks up the pace and becomes a good song. Not the best, but I like it.\n\nThe Count of Tuscany: Nineteen minutes. Awesome four-minute intro. Really catchy. This song punched me in the gut right away. It's got the Portnoy growls again. It gets really quiet after about ten minutes, and is sort of boring for a while, but then gets good again. The end sometimes gives me goosebumps. It's the perfect way to close the album.\n\nI would pretty much recommend this for any fan of metal. It's a great album and well worth the money.\n",
        "\nIn 2003, Dream Theater may have been going through a bit of an identity crisis; of course, this album gets badgered and dismissed as DT trying to sound like Metallica. I disagree. Stuff like this happens with many bands; how many times have we seen it with Rush? First they were hard rock, then had a (wonderful) prog stint and then got commercialized in the 80's. Same thing happened with Judas Priest; they were a major player back in the 70's singing about death metaphors and spirits before the 80\u2019s came around which more people are familiar with, when they were about \"rocking\" and driving fast cars and breaking laws (pun intended). If they can do it without taking shit, why can't Dream Theater? It had to happen sometime, and 2003 would be that year.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the pros first: since this is basically their heaviest record, the musicianship on here is among the best they have had put out; they did not disappoint. Furious fretwork by Petrucci and jaw-dropping solos coupled with mind-blowing drumming provided by Mike Portnoy fuel this metal machine like diesel. Songs are long, complex and fairly well-written. Better than some of their later material, that\u2019s for sure. One half-ballad, Endless Sacrifice, and another, Vacant (like \u201cWait for Sleep\u201d from Images and Words) serves to give you taste of what the next track holds. I like that they did this, and really had no complaints. \n\nToT was the first DT album I bought at the recommendation of a friend and liked it a lot actually. This was the album that got me into them. Then I started reading what other people thought about it. \"This Dying Soul sucks because of rapping\" \u201cThey don\u2019t pull off the heaviness well\u201d etc. I disagree with these claims; I had no problem with the so called \u201crapping\u201d during \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d, nor did I feel the lyrics of this album were juvenile, as I heard one nay-sayer claim. It does however feature a rather weak closer, \u201cIn the Name of God\u201d, I like its\u2019 chorus though. It\u2019s a good song on its own, but as a closer it fails to capture the epic feeling of \u201cLearning to Live, \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d and (my favorite) \u201cOctavarium\u201d in comparison. \n\nThe production sounds great, however Jordan Rudess basically takes a backseat, and Myung\u2019s bass also seems absent, since (wanting to be like Metallica apparently) it seems like the wanted only minimal keyboard work this time, and just cut bass guitar out almost altogether. Luckily they would finally be utilized in when recording Octavarium. LaBrie also does not pull of wanting to sound \u201chard\u201d very well. It\u2019s already been established that he is best at hitting high notes. Sounding like James Hetfield or some other thrash metal singer is not his expertise. But it doesn\u2019t really bring the album down all that much thankfully. And I\u2019ve heard all kinds of mixed opinions about its instrumental Stream of Consciousness, but I think it\u2019s a very good one, it is also the song which has the most use of keyboards. It has a nice sense of progression to it too. But I still believe Erotomania is their best one. \n\nAll in all, this is actually a decent album and worth a buy if you can get over the underused keyboards and LaBrie\u2019s poor attempt to sound heavier than he should be in most songs. Standouts include \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d \u201cHonor Thy Father\u201d and \u201cStream of Consciousness\u201d.\n",
        "\n20 years of a career... that's the cause of this live album. Dream Theater, perhaps the most important name in the whole progressive metal, celebrated their 20th anniversary with their fans in the most epic way possible: releasing a live album. The band has reached undescribable heights, musically speaking, on their career, and this is the perfect way for them to tell the fans \"thank you for your support\". This is how it goes for \"Score\".\n\nThe album has a pretty entertaining tracklist. They did a good choice by playing one song per album (with the exception of \"Octavarium\" and \"Images and Words\"). They began with \"The Root of All Evil\", a good song since it compiles aggressivity with progressiveness. Then, \"I Walk Beside You\". First mistake. Most probably, they know this song is extremely criticized and choosing it was not right. Well, the performance is good, at least. From this point on, the concert is bound to follow a Dream Theater's timeline, beginning with \"Another Won\", a song from the Majesty days. They did some good choices, like \"Under a Glass Moon\", \"Raise the Knife\" and \"The Spirit Carries On\", but they also did mistakes, playing the whole \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" was probably the biggest one, knowing that they could play \"A Change of Seasons\" and a largest song than \"Vacant\" from Train of Thought instead. The three last songs on the concert really get me going. \"Sacrificed Sons\" is excellent, they performed it perfectly and the orchestra really helps a lot. \"Octavarium\" was my personal favorite from the whole live album. There is nothing more exciting than LaBrie screaming \"Trapped inside this Octavarium\" at the end of the song. Then, the essential \"Metropolis Pt. 1\". There is not Dream Theater concert without this song, but this one is special, they played it exactly as in the album, and I appreciate the fact that LaBrie didn't changed the vocal melodies throughout the song at all. \n\nEveryone in the band played the songs perfectly. If there is something that is perfect as a fact in Dream Theater, that would be their live presentations. There are absolutely no mistakes in the whole performance, not even by LaBrie, being he the one that at times messes it up a bit. Petrucci does an excellent job with the riffs; I would like to highlight \"The Root of Evil\" and \"Solitary Shell\". Rudess loves to modify the keyboard solos when live, and he does it great in here. \"Under a Glass Moon\" gets basically a new solo, having fully Rudess' style, believe me, it's excellent. Also, pay attention to him in \"Raise the Knife\", he does great backups. Despite his shyness, Myung is great in here. He has always being great, but he really stands out with the chosen songs, especially those from \"Images and Words\". Portnoy... well, he is in the drummer's hall of fame, there is nothing to be expected but perfection, and that's the only thing you'll listen to in the whole album by him. \"Sacrificed Sons\" has the drum solo for him to show off; he took advantage of this a lot, to be honest. LaBrie, as mentioned earlier, did an impressive job. He sang \"Innocence Faded\" with all the high notes without missing one of them, and \"Metropolis Pt.1\" identically to the one on the album.\n\nI haven't heard any complaints about the sound quality of the album, well; there is no possibility for them to be made, actually. There is a perfect sound for every single instrument, the bass, guitar, keyboard, and even the orchestra. Backing vocals are heard properly every time they are needed and there is no echoing on it, plus, you can listen to the audience, which is probably the most important thing in a live album (only topped by how the band plays, of course). Proof for this is \"The Test That Stumped Them All\", where LaBrie lets the audience do the yelling on the verse.\n\nIf you are a big Dream Theater fan, if you are a progressive metal fan or if you are even a metal fan in general, this is definitely a must, unless you don't like live albums... no, not even that way. If you don't have this yet, go and buy it now, see how amazing live music can be.\n",
        "\nWell if the Queen cover didn\u2019t prove it, this sure does; Dream Theater are a band braver than most. King Crimson is one of those bands that are simply untouchable, especially in their 70\u2019s incarnation, which is where this particular track is from. Their arrangements are too complex, their atmosphere\u2019s too distinctive, and their songs just plain too good for any band to have hope of doing them any real justice. Between the Buried and Me tried it and had to resort to an autotune drenched cover of one of their 80\u2019s tunes. King Crimson is just too damn good.\n\nWhich is exactly why I suspect Dream Theater were willing to go out on a limb and do this cover. The challenge of trying to cover this song must have been too great for Dream Theater to resist. And so they jumped head first into one of the original prog metal instrumentals. First things first, it\u2019s really nice to hear John Myung again. He gets plenty of visibility here since the song makes liberal use of dirty grinding bass lines juxtaposed against electric violin and softer keyboard patches. It\u2019s also nice that Dream Theater left the structure and arrangement of the song relatively intact. If there\u2019s any band out there that can pull off all of this intense rhythmic interplay, odd metric division and recreate Robert Fripp\u2019s compositional idiosyncrasies, it\u2019s Dream Theater. They even made sure to get the violin parts played by an actual violin instead of letting Jordan Rudess play them on keyboards. The dual drumming during the guitar solo might be overkill, but it\u2019s a valiant attempt at recreating the \u201cdouble trio\u201d ensembles that King Crimson used in the 90\u2019s.\n\nThe song is performed slightly faster and the guitar tone is slightly heavier, but overall the performance has much less noise or bite than the original. Case in point, the original guitar solo was more squalling feedback than actual music, where here it is buried in the mix and fairly tame. Chalk another fault up to modern production, but things never feel as aggressive or dangerous when they are this clean. All the dirt that makes that middle riff so punishing is cleaned off, making the part seem far less intense then it should. Overall however this is a solid cover, and Dream Theater never miss a note so you can\u2019t accuse them of ruining the song. It takes serious guts to mess with the King, but Dream Theater have the skills to back up such a brash action and it pays off for the listeners.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve never heard the original version of this song, nor have I heard anything from Zebra but apparently they were a big deal in Long Island when Dream Theater were just starting out. Judging from this cover, the two bands don\u2019t really sound much a like, but I suppose the song has some sentimental value to the band.\n\nThis song has two modes and switches between them for the entirety of the piece. It isn\u2019t exactly an interesting structure but it works. Those two modes are, in order of appearance are a soft acoustic section a la Led Zeppelin\u2019s softer material and a up tempo hard rock chorus a la Led Zeppelin\u2019s heavier material. So all in all this sounds a great deal like everyone\u2019s favorite red shark fetishists right down to the gratuitous use of the word \u201cbaby\u201d. So this isn\u2019t the most original composition by any means, but if you\u2019re going to rip off a band, you could do worse than Led Zeppelin. And if you\u2019re going to have a band perform your song, you can\u2019t do too much better than Dream Theater. The keyboard leads during the verses are tasteful and James LaBrie has always been good at low-key vocals. The hard rock parts are done well enough since John Pectrucci is on guitar. The only part of the song that flat out doesn\u2019t work is the solo section at the end which seems to have been tacked on to satisfy the band\u2019s raging libido and to give Mike Portnoy a chance to go bonkers with double bass. This makes the song, which already drags on a fair amount, unnecessarily long.\n\nUnless you\u2019re a Zebra fan or an obsessive Dream Theater fan, you\u2019re not going to get too much out of this. You\u2019re better off spending money on some of the other covers that Dream Theater released around the same time.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s been far too long since the last Dream Theater instrumental way back in 2003. Dream Theater has always excelled at writing memorable and intricate songs sans vocals and it\u2019s always a delight to find an instrumental track on a new record of theirs. This new piece, labeled with the groan worthy title of \u201cRaw Dog\u201d is no exception.\n\nThis time around it looks like Dream Theater have decided to use the instrumental format in order to vent some of their heavier riffs. This is a smart move, as James LaBrie\u2019s vocals would be ill fitting over such a tumultuous and aggressive backdrop. The song begins with a stuttering staccato rhythm reminiscent of Meshuggah, although Mike Portnoy has a very different approach to polyrhythm than Tomas Haake making it easy to recognize this as the work of Dream Theater. It also has Jordan Rudess sprinkling his keyboard magic all over the track, which is also decidedly un-Meshuggah. When the song picks up in tempo it strongly resembles \u201cA Nightmare to Remember\u201d and the solo section of \u201cA Rite of Passage\u201d both off of Dream Theater\u2019s most recent full length. Given the proximity of the two releases, I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if some of these riffs were indeed leftovers from the \u201cBlack Clouds & Silver Linings\u201d session. The highlights of the song include the fast paced thrash riffs under the solo section, the unison run that follows shortly after and the wacky circus keyboard bit that only Rudess could pull off.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t a fan of the band\u2019s vocals and give the excuse that you find them to be too soft and cheesy for your tastes, this song will do the trick for you. If you\u2019re a total wimp and can\u2019t stand it when Dream Theater get heavy, go back to listing to Owner of A Lonely Heart. Given that this song is only worthy a dollar on iTunes, you don\u2019t have too much of a reason to not check this out. It\u2019s one of the many pieces of proof that Dream Theater is by no means fading with age.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve always wondered how Symphony X feels about Dream Theater. They sure seem to get along given that they\u2019ve toured with each other multiple times but there must be some resentment in the Symphony X camp. Think about it, both bands play very similar styles of music to essentially the same audience, but somehow Dream Theater have worked their way to the top of the prog food chain and have even broken into the mainstream to a certain degree. Symphony X on the other hand has been languishing in relative obscurity despite releasing nothing but high quality material. And so finally the two prog metal titans come face to face on this split for the ultimate showdown.\n\nIn this corner, dressed in black tights with fake vampire fangs, hailing from the suburbs of Long Island, we have Dream Theater\u2019s \u201cForsaken\u201d. Dream Theater has been training at the Roadrunner gym prior to this match up and it shows. This song is clearly built to be a crowd pleaser. It\u2019s got just enough technicality for Dream Theater\u2019s long standing prog fans (notice how the verse is in 7/8) but the soaring chorus and soft and almost Evanescence-esque piano parts will probably help draw in some less nerdy listeners. Not to mention that the lyrics detail the type of vampire love story that pretty much guarantees money in the bank these days. And overall the song does work. It\u2019s catchy, the guitar playing is energetic, and the song varies itself enough over the course of five minutes that people probably won\u2019t get too bored with it.\n\nAnd in this corner, in the ridiculous silver armor and angel wings, from the industrial wasteland of New Jersey, is Symphony X with \u201cSet The World On Fire\u201d. This track has got all the hallmarks of a Symphony X heavy weight, and unlike Dream Theater who have learned to mask their technicality for mass consumption, Symphony X let you know up front that they can shred your face off. There is no member of the band that doesn\u2019t pull his weight in this song. The guitars do unison runs with the bass, solos are traded with keyboards (in harpsichord settings of course) the drums keep the double bass pounding and Russell Allen continues to demonstrate why he\u2019s one of the kings of rasped clean vocals. This tune hits hard and fast, but an astute Symphony X fan will notice nothing new in this tune.\n\nAnd this is ultimately why Dream Theater will win every bout with Symphony X. Dream Theater has adapted their signature style and has stayed current to the best of their abilities. While this has resulted in the occasional misstep (i.e. Falling Into Infinity) it has allowed them to stay relevant and interesting through their entire career. Symphony X on the other hand have stuck to their guns their entire career so their style has become fairly predictable, even when the songs they pump out are solid. Who win\u2019s this round? That\u2019s up to you.\n",
        "\nI have to say, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this album. I love Dream Theater and no one can deny that the band members are incredible players, but this is an odd album for me. There's times when I listen to it and love it, and then times when I listen to it and really don't think it's that great.\n\nThere is some top-notch stuff here, though. The opening two songs are fantastic, with the former (In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 1) being a pretty solid Dream Theater song, with lots of soloing and terrific playing all around. It's sort of the kind of song I expect them to do on a regular basis; it's not amazing but it certainly isn't too shabby at all. Forsaken, the second track, is a terrific shorter piece, focusing more on a slightly darker (and dare I say \"gothic\") atmosphere and a good catchy chorus. Forsaken was the single and if I'm not mistaken the song that got radio play. The rest of the songs sort of waver between okay, good and not that great, except for The Ministry of Lost Souls. This is the kind of song Dream Theater need to be writing; long, technical, multiple long solos and non-conventional structuring. It's one of my favorite Dream Theater songs and definitely the strongest on the whole album. There's a few interesting moments here and there, such as the Opeth-like psychedelic rocker Repentance, which is a good relaxing song and something of a throwback to the psychedelic/trippy feel of 70s progressive rock. Other than that though, the songs are just not that great. The solos are all cool, the band is in top form and James LaBrie sounds terrific, but the songs just don't pack any real punch.\n\nI don't hate this album and I listen to it fairly often, but my selection of songs on it is pretty thin. When the band tries to sound heavy and metallic, like on Constant Motion and The Dark Eternal Night, it just plain old doesn't work. However, the softer songs like Repentance and the more typical Dream Theater songs like the opener and The Ministry of Lost Souls really let the band shine. This isn't a bad album, it just lacks some of the fire that other Dream Theater albums have. Thankfully the slight slump in songwriting isn't an ongoing problem, as the latest album has shown.\n\nIn conclusion, Systematic Chaos has a couple of good Dream Theater songs and a couple of not so good songs. Don't expect to be blown away by this album but don't expect a total failure. I'd recommend buying a couple song off of iTunes or whatever service you use, and leave the rest alone.\n",
        "\nI have to admit, I'm something of a Dream Theater fanboy. With the exception of some of their earliest albums, there's nothing of theirs I don't like. I honestly believe that they're one of the most talented groups of musicians to ever form, and this album to me is the high point of their entire career and one of the high points of music as a whole.\n\nThere is a LOT going on in this album, so I'll start with some general specifics. This is a LONG album. Three of the 12 tracks are over 11 minutes long (Beyond This Life, Home and Finally Free), and each of these is basically the band playing as furiously as possible for as long as possible. These do take some getting used to just because of how long and drawn out they can be, but they're balanced by several shorter and more accessible songs. These include Fatal Tragedy and Strange Deja Vu, which while having incredible solos throughout are also catchy and more conventionally structured songs. There's also shorter interludes (Regression, Overture 1928, Through My Words, and One last Time ranging from a minute to four minutes, and these are actually very enjoyable.\n\nWhile not really what I would call a \"metal\" album, it does have its heavier and more metallic moments, involving very fast double-bass drumming courtesy of Mike Portnoy and some good heavy (but still very catchy) guitar riffs delivered by John Petrucci. The tempo is generally mid-to-slow paced and airs more on the progressive rock side, as opposed to metal. The writing here is superb in every area, with elements of classical, jazz, blues, psychedelic rock (Home), ragtime (The Dance of Eternity) and gospel (Through Her Eyes and The Spirit Carries On) all being used and used brilliantly. Since this is Dream Theater, no real explanation is needed on the proficiency of the actual playing; every member here is a virtuoso, period. James LaBrie is brilliant here as well, hitting some absolutely terrific high notes and putting a tremendous amount of feeling and soul into his singing.\n\nThe two best parts about this album for me would be the instrumental The Dance of Eternity and the ballad The Spirit Carries On. The Dance of Eternity is nothing short of a mind-blowing display of technicality from the band, with something like 130 time changes in 6 minute song, a ragtime piano solo, an insane bass solo and more guitar and drum solos than you can count. Incredible piece. The Spirit Carries On is quite the opposite; it's a very relaxed ballad but I'm willing to say it's the single best Dream Theater song ever written. Flawless vocals and a guitar solo that would make Pink Floyd blush as well as a full gospel choir, this is the epitome of brilliant.\n\nWhile Dream Theater have had a fantastic career with some truly brilliant albums, this is the pinnacle of it all. Technically brilliant but still having real soul and emotion in every song, Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From a Memory is definitely essential listening for anyone who likes good music.\n\nhttp://whitefrozen.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nDream Theater ranks as one of my all-time favorite bands. There's nothing about them I don't like; from the insanely long and complicated songs and solos, the virtuosity of every member of the band, the self-referencing that appears on ever album, everything. I love this band, and I say that about very few band in the metal world.\n\nBlack Clouds and Silver Linings is the tenth full length album from Dream Theater, and in my opinion ranks as one of the best albums they've put out. I'm not a huge fan of their earlier music, from When Day and Dream Unite(their first album) until Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory, which I consider the bands high point and the high point of the entire progressive/rock/metal scene. I'd honestly put that album above Pink Floyds Dark Side of The Moon as the greatest album of the genre. While BCASL isn't quite on that level, I'd certainly rank it in the top 3 or 4 best albums Dream Theater have ever made.\n\nAfter the previous album, Systematic Chaos, (which wasn't a bad album on its own, but for Dream Theater, it was pretty weak) I didn't have terribly high hopes for this album. Thankfully the band decided to basically do the opposite of Systematic Chaos, which is to say that they put a heck of a lot more effort into the songwriting than on SC. The writing here is the strongest its been in years; from the heavy and hard-hitting opening track to the gargantuan 20 minute Count of Tuscany to the arena rock ballad of Wither, the band is in absolute top form. This is Dream Theater firing on all cylinders, and the result is amazing. John Petrucci really gives a stellar performance (as always) on guitar, with some insane solos, heavy, complex riffs and some fantastic acoustic playing. Mike Portnoy is his usual brilliant self on drums, with a few really fast double-bass and even blast-beats thrown in, which is a first for Dream Theater if I'm not mistaken. Keyboards and bass, handled by Jordan Rudess and John Myung are both brilliant as well, though both are slightly more in the background than on previous albums, with less keyboard and bass shredding and placed in more supporting roles, though the keyboards do break out in a shred on occasion. \n\n\nMy favorite part of Dream Theater, however, is James Labrie, whom I consider to be one of the best male vocalists alive. I absolutely love his voice, and I think I'm in the minority for this, but I consider him to be a brilliant singer. While he's not hitting those ear-splitting high notes like on the first DT albums, he still puts on quite a show, with highs, lows, and everything in between belted out perfectly. While I happen to think his best vocal performance was on the Score 20th Anniversary tour for Dream Theater, this is definitely one of his finer moments.\n\nBlack Clouds and Silver Linings is Dream Theaters best album in years, and is hopefully a good indication of where the band is going musically in the years to come. Highlights from the album would be The Best of Times, a tribute to Mike Portnoys deceased father and one of the best Dream Theater songs ever written; Wither, a terrific power ballad; and A Nightmare to Remember, which is one of the bands heaviest songs in years. For anyone who likes virtuoso playing, brilliant song-writing and all around flawlessly executed music, this album is for you.\n",
        "\nEver since the surprise success of \"Images and Words\" back in 1992, Dream Theater was always one of those bands that thrived on a massively loyal fanbase while just falling short of a major mainstream breakthrough. However, that all seemed to change when this 2007 effort managed to crack the Billboard's Top 20 and introduced the band to a new legion of music listeners. Of course, the magic of it all was that every signature aspect of Dream Theater was surprisingly kept intact through it all...\n\nMusically, I like to describe this album as a sort of cross between 2003's \"Train of Thought\" and 2005's \"Octavarium.\" On one hand, the riffs/song structures are surprisingly heavy and the vocals are more aggressive thanks to some interesting contributions by drummer Mike Portnoy on such tracks as \"The Dark Eternal Night.\" On the other hand, there are plenty of melodic moments on such tracks as \"Repentance\" and \"The Ministry of Lost Souls,\" and \"Forsaken\" has an accessible fusion of both elements. Hell, \"Prophets of War\" even has some of those Muse influences that everyone is so divided on!\n\nAs several have suggested in previous reviews, I believe that this album's highlight is none other than the 25 minute epic known as \"In the Presence of Enemies.\" Cleverly divided into two parts as an homage to Pink Floyd's \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\" the first part starts the album off with a nice extended introduction and some cool soft/heavy trade-offs during the verses and choruses. The second part is where the song truly shines as it features a twisted atmosphere during the building verses and chilling chorus, a demonic fast paced segment with guitar playing that just screams Iron Maiden worship, another extended solo section that brings in some clever allusions and a nicely dramatic ending. Throw in some strange Faustian lyrics and you have one of my personal favorite Dream Theater epics to date, even if the long-winded introduction makes it an acquired taste...\n\nSpeaking of lyrics, this album also features some of the band's most intriguing themes to date. While past topics such as stress (\"Constant Motion\"), alcoholism (\"Repentance\"), and politics (\"Prophets of War\") continue to be touched upon, this album also dabbles in more supernatural themes and plays with the occult on \"Forsaken\" and \"The Dark Eternal Night.\" Some moments may be a little too generic at times, but it's generally pretty interesting to hear Dream Theater's take on vampires, demons, and other twisted forces.\n\nIn terms of weaknesses, this album's biggest flaw seems to be a few lesser tracks not standing up to the highlights on here. \"Constant Motion\" is a solid number inspired by Metallica, but a few awkward vocal trade-offs keep it from being a true highlight and \"Prophets of War\" is set back by a slightly awkward structure and the controversial Muse touches. Portnoy's more prominent vocals may also be unwelcomed by some listeners but I find them to be pretty tolerable.\n\nAll in all, this may be my fourth favorite DT album and one of the strongest albums that 2007 had to offer. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you like the two efforts before it.\n\nPros:\n1) Cool balance of heavy/melodic styles\n2) Interesting changes in lyrical themes\n3) \"In the Presence of Enemies\" may be my favorite Dream Theater epic to date\n\nCons:\n1) A few lesser tracks\n2) Controversial vocals by Portnoy\n3) Slightly generic lyrical moments\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"In The Presence of Enemies,\" \"Forsaken,\" \"The Dark Eternal Night,\" \"Repentance,\" and \"The Ministry of Lost Souls\"\n",
        "\nMy first exposure to Dream Theater was the now well-known single/solitary radio hit, Pull Me Under. After hearing it, I wasn't completely blown back on my ass, but I decided to order Images and Words anyway. This was (and still is) a great decision. This is one of those CDs that beyond a shadow of a doubt, forms such a precedent for a genre that legions of copycats are inevitably spawned. I'm talking influence on par with Reign In Blood, Altars of Madness, Keeper of the Seven Keys, and any other famous genre-definers you happen to love. IAW has become a genre standard for prog because it completely embodies everything prog is supposed to be: progressive. \n\nSome would be willing to argue that this kind of \"progression\" begets cries of \"pop\" and \"untrue metal\" but I don't think this could be farther from the truth. True, you won't find Cannibal Corpse level brutality, or any kind of \"faster means better\" mentality, but you'll find something better: a time when Dream Theater wrote memorable and tight songs. GASP! Many say that keyboardist Kevin Moore was a large part of this level of unsurpassed songwriting this band used to be renowned for, and I'll side with them any day of the week. Never feeling a need to show off for 12 minutes on a 16 minute song, Moore knows how to make emotional key melodies that actually form a valid component of the music instead of substituting for lackluster songwriting. Apparently his sense of self-control and emotion seem to have rubbed off on the other band members, as they only really replicated this level of perfection once more on Awake.\n\nEvery member is in their top form, all contributing the best material they have to offer to make songs that maintain an abstract focus that you could only truly understand if you heard the album. Yes, there is still TONS of interplay between guitar, drums, and keys, but unlike on other albums where they became obsessed with technicality, every instrumentalist seems compelled to make you run the entire emotional spectrum in every song. Tracks like Pull Me Under, Another Day, Under A Glass Moon, Metropolis, and Learning To Live truly show this off, John Petrucci playing intricate riffs that dance on the border of wank, then rapidly swing back into you with full emotional impact, all within a matter of seconds. When an album has 9 songs with an average length around 7 minutes, this seems like it might get annoying or rambling, but it almost always feels too short. Oddly enough, I'm reminded of Bal-Sagoth's tendency to write 7 minute songs that feel like they're 3 minutes. It's enough to bring a tear to my eye knowing that DT will never make anything like this again. \n\nI can't truly explain what this album sounds like, there's too much there (i.e. saxophone in Another Day, weird decomposing instrument collision in Metropolis, mood switches in Pull Me Under). However, I know you've heard at least a million prog bands who simply try to get by by attempting to replicate this album. Imagine the often aped sound, but played with a level of conviction and emotion not possible for the mere imitators to create. \n\nOne more thing: give the album several tries. I wasn't blown away by this or Awake on first listen; now that I've LISTENED to them a few times, I can't go more than a day without listening to one song off of either. This album is truly prog metal at its peak of originality and creativity.\n",
        "\nDoes it really count as a cover if two members of the band being covered appear on the new version? An even more important question; does it really count as a cover if the original band already sounds like this ALL THE TIME? This is like Strapping Young Lad covering Ministry, or Trivium covering Metallica (oh wait.) Now I haven\u2019t heard the original version of this song so I can\u2019t comment on how different this one is. But either way, this does sound a great deal like Dream Theater. \n\nThe first two minutes especially are filled with the usual hallmarks of a Dream Theater instrumental tune. Calm ambient intro and then more odd time riffing and fast moving guitar parts than you can shake a stick at. I\u2019d imagine that the main differences from the original track lie in the drum parts, since this version has so many Portnoy-isms that I simply can\u2019t imagine anyone else having played these exacts parts but him. Just listen to all of those staccato cymbal patterns and ask yourself if that sounds like the Dixie Dredgs to you. After the initial onslaught things mellow out into an acoustic section with lead violin. Something about said violin really bugs me. Even though I know that it\u2019s a real instrument being played by a real person, something about it just seems fake. This alternates with a goofy keyboard part that screams \u201cJordan Rudess era Dream Theater\u201d from the top of a mountain. I know that the guy was in the Dixie Dredgs and all, but the similarity is really frightening. And then we\u2019re off to solo land. Not only do the riffs used in the solo section sound like Dream Theater, but the thing is structured exactly like a Dream Theater solo section! John gets a solo, Jordan gets a solo, John gets another solo, everyone gets a solo etc. All of this is over a stream of riffs used earlier in the tune that change slightly half way through the solo. Wasn\u2019t this a tune off of \u201cScenes From a Memory\u201d?\n\nOnce you get past how creepy this resemblance is, it\u2019s a cool tune, especially for Dream Theater fans that can never have enough technical instrumental music (read: all dream theater fans). The main riffs are really energetic and technical without being too overbearing and the soft part in the middle is fairly unique, although that violin still irks me. Still, it\u2019s uncanny.\n",
        "\nFor many Dream Theater fans, their first album with James LaBrie, \u2018Images and Words\u2019, is the best release in the illustrious DT discography. This is one thing that in my opinion shouldn\u2019t be argued. The band challenged themselves a lot on that album, resulting in a varied track list. I personally don\u2019t judge Another Day as the highlights of the albums but it is an interesting track, nonetheless. What with the sax taking over and pushing guitar to the back in some parts of the song. Is this track good enough to be released as a single, you ask? Yes it is.\n\nThe song is considerably different from the other tracks present on Images and Words mainly due to the fact that it is more of a progressive rock song than a proper metal one. It is a bit difficult to assign a particular prog rock genre to the song; I have seen it being inaccurately called jazz fusion a lot of times, which is nothing short of blasphemy. The mere presence of the saxophone, an instrument usually associated with jazz, is not enough for a song to be classified as jazz rock or jazz fusion. I believe it would be appropriate to consider it a heavy prog song with a few elements of jazz. Imagine it as a marriage of Porcupine Tree\u2019s modern prog sound and Herbie Hancock\u2019s take on jazz rock; of course all of this is still based on a particularly soft variant of the typical DT sound.\n\nAs expected, this song is pretty strong in the technicality department. No wankery to be seen here as Petrucci and co. go for a restrained approach. In particular, John Petrucci\u2019s leads on this track are complex yet quite easy to comprehend. The solo in particular is a real treat, one of the better solos that I have heard in songs that have a power balladesque feel to them. Petrucci is also the writer of the song, with lyrics touching on his father\u2019s struggle with cancer. Kevin Moore\u2019s keyboard gymnastics are ear-pleasing as well but his role here is slightly less compared to the other songs on the album. Portnoy isn\u2019t his usual hard hitting self here; he slows down, adding a jazzy feel to the drumwork. The use of the soprano saxophone, courtesy Jay Beckenstein of the jazz fusion band Spyro Gyra, adds more fuel to the jazz fire burning here, even after that, the track is essentially a DT song and is still far from some of the jazz influenced progressive acts, both retro and modern. The song has a power ballad feel to it, but it is still one of the most progressive DT tracks out there. In its essentials the song is mostly devoid of heaviness, with Petrucci\u2019s guitar tone being the only \u2018heavy\u2019 feature of the song.\n\nOh! I almost forgot about the supremely accomplished, yet despised by all; James LaBrie. There is no denying the fact that in recent times LaBrie has given quite a few unimpressive vocal performances but his work on Images and Words was mostly satisfying. But on this track he is a bit inconsistent; while I\u2019ll admit that the higher notes he hits during the chorus are quite good, his lower, so called \u2018heartfelt\u2019 vocals during the verses are a bit sugary and 'precious' sounding. They are not bad in the conventional terms and initially they had been one of the stronger aspects of LaBrie\u2019s work on this album for me, but with time the novelties wore away and now; well, let\u2019s just say that I don\u2019t appreciate them so much. \n\nThe live tracks present here are interesting collectibles as well and I think are atleast worth a listen if you are an avid fan of the band. The main problem that has plagued most of the DT live performances in recent time i.e. LaBrie\u2019s inconsistent vocals are not an issue here at all, as he does a good job on both the live tracks. The track, A Fortune in Lies was originally seen on When Dream and Day Unite. This live track was a chance for LaBrie to prove his vocal superiority over Charles Dominici and he doesn\u2019t disappoint. In pure musical terms, the track wasn\u2019t the best on the album it originally appeared on. It\u2019s decent but that\u2019s the best I can say about it. Although LaBrie improves it, making it more enjoyable but the main track totally smokes it. Probable the live performance of a better track from the debut would have resulted in a more balanced single. But this very minor flaw doesn\u2019t tarnish this single much. It is worth a purchase for the ardent DT fan, others can keep themselves happy listening to the rendition of Another Day present on the studio album.\n",
        "\nSo it\u2019s the year 2009 and like the well-oiled machine that they are, Dream Theater have rolled out another hour plus prog metal extravaganza in the shape of an album. And typically, they brought along the obligatory radio friendly ballad track. I\u2019ve noticed that ever since Octavarium, fans have railed against Dream Theater for apparently selling out by writing softer ballad tunes. This has always struck me as a fairly na\u00efve point of view. Dream Theater has always had songs like \u201cWither\u201d. In the early 90\u2019s they had \u201cAnother Day\u201d, a song that attempted to ride the coat tails of the smooth jazz scene. On literally every album since (except Train of Thought, but honestly that one doesn\u2019t really count) they\u2019ve had at least one song tailor made for whatever they think the pop music climate looks like. But since this is a prog metal band we\u2019re talking about here, they tend to be a bit behind the times. And thank god for that, because \u201cWither\u201d would suffer greatly from autotune (which we will discuss in further detail later on).\n\nLet\u2019s start digging into the meat of this one, shall we? Right from the start we have James LaBrie emoting and taking over exaggerated deep breathes to show you how distressed he is. We get a moody down tuned guitar backdrop, with soft keyboard patches providing the aural pillow for you fall on in slow motion for the inevitable music video. The pre-chorus comes in, builds some tension, and then we\u2019re hit with a huge chorus that is irresistibly catchy. Seriously, next time you\u2019re standing on the edge of a cliff with waves crashing around you, I dare you to not sing this at the top of your lungs. After the chorus we repeat the process, this time with some extra vocal harmonies and then we\u2019re treated to an epic rendition of \u201cZelda\u2019s Lullaby\u201d as a bridge. Maybe it\u2019s just my inner nerd (hardly concealed to be honest, I\u2019m reviewing a freakin\u2019 Dream theater EP for Christ sakes) but this part is pretty cool since the vocal melodies actually carry some really power. Finally we get a soft chorus (lose the whisper vocals buddy), an arena sized John Petrucci solo and another loud chorus. All in all, it\u2019s kind of corny but catchy, and the solo is appropriately awesome.\n\nThe piano version of \u201cWither\u201d is a bit more laid back, which is good news if you\u2019re not into being beat over the head by theatrical guitars. Plus, you get an even better listen at James LaBrie breathing his heart out! The one problem here is the bridge, which is pretty audibly corrected, and thus brings us to the demo version. While I understand the logic behind using autotune in order show the main vocalist what the melodies should sound like, it ain\u2019t exactly pleasant to listen to. John Petrucci would probably be a decent singer if his voice weren\u2019t smothered in digital correction. Finally we get to the only non-\u201cWither\u201d track on this little EP. \u201cThe Best of Times\u201d exemplifies the correct way to write an emotional prog rock tune without descending into gimmicks. The song is exactly the same as the album version, except with a synth violin instead of a real one, and a drummer for a singer instead of a real singer. Joking aside, Mike Portnoy is a very inconsistent vocalist. Sometimes he nails it, and other times, like here, he just sort of hits the notes without really putting forth any effort. The rest of the song is great though, from the stately intro to the more upbeat Rush-esque section, and all the way to the unbelievably good guitar solo.\n\nOverall, this is pretty much a \u201cdiehard fan only\u201d release. If you want to get a good glimpse of Dream Theater\u2019s emotional/poppy side circa 2009, you\u2019re better off actually buying Black Clouds & Silver Linings.\n",
        "\nDream Theater is one of those bands that everybody has an opinion about. Some outright detest the band; such as the rest of the staff here at Metal Temple, I suspect. They\u2019re simply boring, or they\u2019re too self-indulgent, they assert. Others positively worship the band; Dream Theater can do no wrong in their minds. Anyone that claims otherwise or anyone that likes another band better than Dream Theater is met with the response \"they aren\u2019t better because x guitarist isn\u2019t more talented than Petrucci and x drummer isn\u2019t better than Portnoy\" or something along those lines. Another group used to love Dream Theater until a certain album, such as \"Awake\" or \"Scenes From A Memory\" and hates everything that they have put out since.\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s opinions about Dream Theater, it is a fact that they are largely responsible for defining progressive Metal as a genre. Each instrumental member is a virtuoso in his own right. With \"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\", Dream Theater has produced an album of only six tracks, but the total running time is over 70 minutes. Whether this was a conscious decision by the band is unclear, but this is definitely not an album for those with short attention spans.\n\n\"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\" kicks off with \"A Nightmare To Remember\" which is a furiously heavy epic. It features several jaw-dropping solos and even includes a blastbeat close to the end of the song, although you have to listen closely for it. This may be the best song that they\u2019ve written in years and is a definite winner. The other heavy song on this album is \"The Shattered Fortress\", which is a conclusion to drummer Mike Portnoy\u2019s 12-step suite, which details every step in his recovery from alcoholism. The majority of the song is made up of variations of themes found in earlier parts from previous albums, but the conclusion is a satisfying and effective ending to the suite. I would love it if Dream Theater released an \u2019EP\u2019 (I can call this proposed idea an EP because their last EP was over 70 minutes long) that contains the entire suite from start to finish, perhaps with a DVD of Portnoy going into details about the meaning behind the lyrics. I\u2019ve also heard rumors that on an upcoming tour, Dream Theater will play the entire suite from start to finish, but at this point it is just a rumor.\n\nAlso included are two upbeat songs in \"Wither\" and \"Best Of Times\". The former is relatively straightforward but is surprisingly effective, which is more than can be said of the terrible \"Forsaken\" off of the previous album and the U2 rip-off \"I Walk Beside You\". The latter is a truly moving song that Portnoy wrote about his deceased father. Thankfully, the lyrics are not the only draw, as the song as a whole manages to be uplifting and emotional (something that previous Dream Theater songs have failed at) without drifting into the realm of cheesiness. Some people may forget, but John Petrucci can be a very emotional guitarist when he wants to be. His leads here at the end of the song, as well as his earlier solo, show a side of Petrucci that has been largely absent on the past several Dream Theater releases.\n\n\"A Rite Of Passage\" serves as the single off of the album (the single edit is only six minutes but actually works really well. If given proper radio airplay, it has the potential to win Dream Theater many new fans). Petrucci shows a bit of a Malmsteen influence in the guitar solo, but it is hardly derivative and is a highlight of the song. The chorus is very catchy and effectual as well; vocalist James LaBrie does a good job all the way through. \"The Count Of Tuscany\" is by far the most progressive on the album, although the band does a good job of making it enjoyable for other listeners as well. There are many odd time-signatures and tempo changes, but the chorus is surprisingly memorable and it does a high-quality job of holding the attention of the listener, despite the length. Let the listener know, however, that this song is in no way musical fast-food; this, like all good progressive epics, takes many listens to sink in and be pleasing.\n\nThis album serves, in many ways, as a return to form for many aspects that some Dream Theater fans, such as myself, had thought were gone forever. The guitar riffs on this album are fantastic. Some fans had accused Dream Theater of writing riffs that were throwaway Metallica riffs, which is total hogwash because they fail to understand that just because a riff is heavy, or contains some palm-muting, it is not a thrash riff. Sure there have been some very heavy Dream Theater songs in the past, but none of them had any thrash riffs. However, they were correct in the assertion that the riffs were sub-par, because for the most part they did suck. Thankfully the riffs on this album are refreshing, yet break new ground as well. There is a riff around 11 minutes into \"A Nightmare To Remember\" that sounds like a riff that technical death-metalers Origin would write.\n\nAlso largely absent are the blatant nods to other bands, such as the aforementioned U2, Coldplay and Muse, among others. This sounds like a Dream Theater album but thankfully does not attempt to be another \"Awake\" or \"Images And Words\". James LaBrie has been hit-or-miss (mostly miss) on the past few albums, but here he is excellent. He writes catchy choruses and effective vocal lines, and expresses the lyrics with emotion. Portnoy is noticeably more present in writing fanatical drum lines, but despite the blastbeats in the first song, there\u2019s nothing that makes me go crazy while air-drumming like the end of \"Blind Faith\" or \"As I Am\".\n\nMuch like Iron Maiden did with \"A Matter Of Life And Death\", Dream Theater has written an album that is a swift kick in the ass of those who accused them of becoming lethargic over time. Those who had written off Dream Theater need to give \"Black Clouds And Silver Linings\" a spin or two (or ten). The increase in quality between releases is astounding and I\u2019m glad that there are still genre stalwarts who can still kick ass in 2009. Although currently, I would give a slight nod to Mastodon and Candlemass for best album of 2009, we will see what happens when December rolls around. Buy or die.\n\nP.S.: The album artwork for this release is remarkable.\n\n(Originally published at www.metal-temple.com)\n",
        "\nNote: Being one of the first metal bands I ever got into, and one of my all-time favourites, I thought it fitting to have a Dream Theater release as my first review. Following the release of Black Clouds & Silver Linings, I decided to delve further into their discography and perhaps review some of their less-known material to start off. Hopefully this will only be the first in a long line of reviews\u2026\n\nFollowing the release of the Images and Words Demos on Mike Portnoy\u2019s Ytsejam Label, The Silent Man sports but one rarity; the soft instrumental Eve. The other two tracks, The Silent Man and the demo for Take the Time appear on Awake and the aforementioned demo release respectively. Eve, however, only appears (in studio form) on the now equally rare Cleaning Out the Closet fanclub release. Following the rerelease of a lot of Dream Theater\u2019s rarer material through Ytsejam Records, and fellow Awake B-side To Live Forever\u2019s appearance on their greatest hit album, Eve has become one of the rarest tracks in Dream Theater\u2019s discography. Now that we\u2019ve decided why this single is worth acknowledging, let\u2019s tackle the actual music, shall we?\n\nLet me start by saying this is not a heavy Dream Theater release. If you listen to this single expecting The Mirror, or Pull Me Under, you will be sorely disappointed. With that said, the material is superb at proving that Dream Theater aren\u2019t mechanical shred machines; of the three tracks found here, only one steps into the fast-paced technical metal territory the band has become known for. The Silent Man opens, and is the exact same version found on Awake. Acoustically driven, it remains one of the many \u201ccould-have-been big\u201d ballads from their early career; soft and accessible enough for the radio, but intelligent and beautiful enough to stand out among other ballads of the time. It\u2019s a real pity that this didn\u2019t garner the success intended.\n\nNext up comes the Take the Time demo track. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right, but I believe this is the same track they sent to ATCO on that three-track demo that landed them a record contract with Atlantic. The production\u2019s top notch, and despite a few differences in the background vocals and the lack of the spoken word samples (a good thing, in my opinion) this track isn\u2019t too far off from what they put on Images and Words. This is the fastest and heaviest the single gets, but the way it winds down at the end into the piano part helps it segue gently into Eve.\n\nNow for any diehard fan, Eve is what they\u2019ve (likely paid, and) been waiting for. I\u2019ve read somewhere that this was mainly composed by Kevin Moore, which doesn\u2019t surprise me one bit; much like Wait For Sleep and Space-Dye Vest, Eve is a very beautiful piano-driven track. Emotionally-charged, Eve\u2019s slow pace, acoustic backing and soft, clean solo make it a unique standout track in Dream Theater\u2019s discography. Highly recommended for fans of their softer ballad material, and for curious fans not looking for blazing solos and tens of time signature changes.\n\nDue to its 1994 release, the fact that it contains only one rarity, and it being currently out of print, The Silent Man is recommended for diehards only. If you have a deep wallet, and love their early ballad/Kevin Moore material, go for it. If you\u2019re a more moderate collector, the single will sometimes go for twenty to thirty bucks if you\u2019re patient. Either way, there\u2019s some great music to be found here. Eve is much more than a B-side criminally ignored by the band; it\u2019s a beautiful, hidden gem, shining from an era long gone.\n",
        "\n'Images and Words' is often hailed as a milestone of progressive metal. In reality, though, not only is it hardly progressive, it is less than decent in quality. Okay, it is \"progressive\" - in the sense it sounds like what is called progressive these days. Strictly, though, it is little more than an incohesive combination of power metal, Rush, and pop that allots more room to pop than power metal. \n\nThe pop allegation is the one that would raise the most eyebrows, but poppy sections are certainly more abundant than power metal sections. While he sounds a bit hysterical, LaBrie is a decent singer. However, the vocal lines he sings are not decent. Sometimes they are - in Pull Me Under, for example, he has some power metal lines, though the \"power metal\" here is closer to Helloween than Fates Warning. But most of the time his lines are poppy whether he sings quietly or loudly. The quieter songs here hardly sound like metal for the majority of their durations, and the decent power metal moments are sparse.\n\nSong structures are not as simplistic as pop, but they are not the advanced progressive grandeurs that one might expect from the hype (look at 'My Journey to the Stars,' for a 1992 example of real structural brilliance). Transitions are awkward, structures amorphous, and development barely present. The Rush-inspired, sometimes not only in principle but also in the specific form of melodic execution, instrumental sections have little if any relationship with the song at hand, and are seldom consistent within themselves, feeling more like a rock band jamming on stage than a thought-out composition. \n\nAs it would be expected on this type of wandering but essentially easy-listening album, there is no emphasis on the riffs. The riffs are mostly some chugging and chords, when they are present at all. There are some little technical instrumental interjections, but these, rather than complementing the main themes, work to interrupt them, as in Under A Glass Moon, serving to prove at once both the band members' high instrumental proficiency and their poor songwriting ability. Even during the long instrumental sections the keyboards generally take the lead role, leaving little room for riffing. Overall, the instruments and the vocals are not integrated well. There are vocal sections and then instrumental sections, working separately (i.e. the instruments seldom do anything meaningful while the vocals are on display, and vice versa) and not even continuing on with what the other has been doing but starting something irrelevant.\n\nAnother attempt at progressiveness resorts to the old, useless trick: diversity. From the jazzy saxophone usage of Another Day to the almost rapping vocals of Take the Time, none of this trick adds anything of substance to the songs. Unfortunately, this is an aspect that many bands took influence from, perhaps because it is one of the easiest ways of sounding prog without real effort (or being actually progressive).\n\n'Images and Words' indeed was a highly influential album, setting many connotations of the term \"progressive\" today as it is used in metal music - lack of integration, flashy instrumental techniques, and variety of transparent influences irrelevant to the rest of the music (note that \"innovative artistic achievement\" has not been mentioned). These are characteristics exhibited not only by the style of music directly under the influence of Dream Theater, but also by extreme metal bands, especially former black metal bands that claim to have evolved. While I do not hold Dream Theater solely responsible for this, I curse it nonetheless.\n",
        "\nAfter two years of wait, here we are with Dream Theater\u2019s tenth studio album \u2013 and, as befitting an album filling the first double-digit spot, it serves as a fine example of album craft in the progressive genre and features the most appreciable sort of songwriting \u2013 cohesiveness that lends itself to meaning and expansion of the musical themes presented. This album has six songs, four of which extend past twelve minutes, giving us seventy-ish minutes of music that doesn\u2019t become boring and gives us what Dream Theater does best: songs with depth and musical worth.\n\nSystematic Chaos, the band\u2019s previous album, was written by that exact process; simply moving the band into the studio and recording as ideas came. This emphasized some of the problems with that process \u2013 in places, the songs felt disjointed, some sections felt out of place, and some songs were too long for their own good. While it was still a decent album and had its own merits, Black Clouds and Silver Linings cleaned up the process and tightened the songs by consequence (Parts were recorded by stages here, as far as I know). Chunks are differentiable without becoming unrelated; songs like album-opener \u201cA Nightmare to Remember\u201d make use of heavier portions (Even allowing drummer Mike Portnoy to venture into blast beat territory) as well as calmer, more melancholic sections and transition between them almost seamlessly. This trend continues throughout the album as a whole. \u201cWither\u201d, a softer, power ballad-like song, is juxtaposed with heavy-hitter \u201cThe Shattered Fortress\u201d, to name one example. There are a lot of different ideas contained here, but unlike some of the songs on Systematic Chaos, they work with one another instead of being conflicting and distracting.\n\n\u201cA Nightmare to Remember\u201d opens the album, and as said before, it combines some of the heaviest parts of the album with some of the most morose and fragile. The storm noise intro at the beginning is a nice touch; it does a good job of conveying the point of the lyrics (About a car crash). A fast, heavier section at the beginning lasting about five minutes and rushing through a little more than half of the lyrics transitions into a slower, more somber and more ambient section featuring some splendid Continuum work by keyboardist Jordan Rudess and quiet, calm vocals from James LaBrie. As a person who focuses a lot on vocals, I consider this part some of my favorite voice-work on the album; it conveys the sense of destruction felt after an accident well. That then leads into Mike Portnoy\u2019s oft-criticized (I think somewhat unfairly) lead vox section \u2013 Portnoy has since explained that he wanted to put in a full death growl and the \u201cConstant Motion\u201d style vox was the result of a compromise with guitarist and lyricist for this song John Petrucci. Portnoy posted a sample of the death growls on his forum and I actually liked that version more, but I think most of the problem here was misplacement of the heavy voice on the last four lines (The \u201ceveryone survived\u201d part). I think that the speaker isn\u2019t giving us as listeners all the information and I\u2019ll spare my own ideas about what the speaker is trying to convey, but I\u2019ll say that I think the choice of emphasizing the fact that everyone lived and nothing more was deliberate.\n\nWe then move to album single \u201cA Rite of Passage\u201d, and while it doesn\u2019t have the epic scope of some of the other songs, it is a solid rocker with a very catchy chorus. Bassist John Myung gives us an incredible bass intro and solid work throughout, even though he tends to be somewhat inaudible unless whatever you\u2019re listening to this on happens to deliver some very low-end, but as a whole the mix for this album is much more balanced than, say, Octavarium or Systematic Chaos. While it\u2019s certainly not the most technical work on the album, it\u2019s a very good song with the sort of feel that \u201cPull Me Under\u201d from Images and Words did.\n\nNext up is a lighter ballad addressing the subject of writer\u2019s block, \u201cWither\u201d. John Petrucci brought this song into the studio as a complete work, and he accomplished what he was going for well \u2013 a softer break in the album that focuses more on emotional aspects than the most technical musicianship. Rudess and LaBrie deliver another very good performance (If you happen to have the Producer\u2019s Edition mix CD that came with the box set of this album, try mixing this song with just the keys and vocals, it\u2019s lovely). I think opening the verses with repeated lines is a nice touch; it expresses the sort of stream of consciousness that occurs in writer\u2019s block (Repeating one phrase, usually a self command like \u201ccome on, come on\u201d in an attempt to break through a block). It\u2019s a nice song and a good break before the next trio.\n\nThe last three songs on the album are all long songs over twelve minutes in length, the first being Steps ten eleven, and twelve of Portnoy\u2019s multi-album suite dealing with the Twelve Steps of Recovery from Alcoholics Anonymous, \u201cThe Shattered Fortress\u201d. A below reviewer harshly criticized this song as highly derivative from prior songs, such as \u201cThe Glass Prison\u201d, and like, and it is \u2013 but the reviewer doesn\u2019t seem to understand those songs are part of a unified suite and the fact that it is very derivative is absolutely intentional, as it is the closer of the suite and is used to recapture the prior ideas from earlier songs for the thematic purpose of reflection and is not laziness on the band\u2019s part in any form. True, this song is at its most enjoyable if the listener knows the previous four songs in the suite, but even so it\u2019s a very good standalone song; it\u2019s very easy to listen through the near thirteen minutes without growing bored or annoyed. I especially like how the band made the \u201cRepentance\u201d quote stronger and I like how smooth and quick the transition into that part was. Another of my favorite parts of the song is how it ends, but I won\u2019t spoil that for you (It\u2019s neat if you know the other songs of the suite). By the by, the lyrics for Step XII: Responsible are a nearly exact quote of the AA motto, and it\u2019s a good tribute. I very much like this song and it\u2019s one of my favorites on the album, but I can understand how people might think it lazy if they don\u2019t understand the intent of the band (Though I would caution against the use of caustic language to attack in light of this ignorance).\n\nAfterwards we get another Portnoy lyric song, \u201cThe Best of Times\u201d, a tribute to Portnoy\u2019s father (Who passed away in the creation of the album). This track has amazing violin work courtesy Jerry Goodman, a classical key section courtesy Jordan Rudess (His Juilliard training shows here) and a classical guitar melody from Petrucci. The song is very touching and while the lyrical form can be a little clich\u00e9, it\u2019s natural and appropriate. It has a lot of major key work, something absent from recent Dream Theater recordings and woks very well, and the ending guitar solo is nothing short of majestic. This song showcases Dream Theater\u2019s return-to-form (That form, ironically enough, being musical diversity on a theory level).\n\nWe end with the longest track on the album and the obligatory epic closer, \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d. This track opens with a long instrumental intro that feels Rush-like in scope and concept, it\u2019s grand and floats through a number of very harmonic musical ideas. We then descend into a heavy lyric section. The lyrics nominally detail a run-in John Petrucci had with a count in Tuscany a few years back. I say nominally because I\u2019m fairly certain that the lyrics are intended to be a simultaneous tribute to Edgar Allan Poe and a rejection of his philosophical outlook, but I won\u2019t delineate my reasoning for that here. Although this is a very long song at nineteen minutes, in contrast to other Dream Theater epics, it isn\u2019t segmented \u2013 the whole thing follows the same song structure, as opposed to something like \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies\u201d or \u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d which are both broken up on their respective CDs or \u201cOctavarium\u201d, which isn\u2019t broken up but does feature a number of sections which aren\u2019t necessarily integral to one another. After the heavy section comes a lower section featuring a set of chimes that works absolutely brilliantly before launching into a final, more positive, and very epic final section and beastly instrumental work from all of the members. The song ends with some ocean noises, contrasting the opening storm and illuminating in the album\u2019s final moments the overall concept, a Newton\u2019s Third Law sort-of thing that essentially says \u201cFor every black cloud, there is an equal and opposite silver lining\u201d.\n\nThis album is well-written, well-executed, and is the epitome of what band should be doing ten albums and twenty years into their careers. While there are some odd moments, they\u2019re minimal, do not detract from the album at all and are likely more a result of my preferences more than any flaw integral to the album. This is a *very* good album and is accessible, at least for the genre in which it exists \u2013 while it wouldn\u2019t be the first album I\u2019d give to introduce someone to Dream Theater given that the majority of the songs are very long, even if they don\u2019t feel as long as they are, it\u2019d definitely be a good second or third choice. Finally, get the three-disc version if you have the chance. The second disc, featuring covers from Rainbow, Queen, the Dixie Dregs, Zebra, King Crimson, and Iron Maiden is great (Especially the Queen cover, praised by Brian May as \u201cPossibly the best Queen cover ever\u201d) and showcase a batch of Dream Theater\u2019s influences extremely well. The instrumental disc is a nice touch too, even though they removed the solos from these tracks and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll listen to it too often.\n\nA very worthy purchase \u2013 go get it if you haven\u2019t already.\n",
        "\nDream Theater strikes again, people, with another LP produced by John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy. Recently, they seem to have the upper hand in the band, commanding the other members what is to be done and what is not. Jordan Rudess may be an exception, but Labrie and Myung are the main victims.\n\n6 songs.115 minutes. Who likes long progressive metal bands will have no problem listening to it. Those who are more into bands like Fates Warning and Queensryche will probably reject this product. Let\u2019s start with the pros. It\u2019s Dream Theater, folks, the same Dream Theater that was reborn in 2002, when Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was released, meaning that this album, Black Clouds and Silver Linings will be as well criticized and used as a fine subject for controversial discussions, just like all Dream Theater albums since 2002. The songs are well created, there\u2019s no doubt about this. Heavy passages mix well with melancholic and melodic ones. All in all, every member of the band does their job properly, they are talented and know how to show it. Highlights? A Rite of Passage, Wither, The Count of Tuscany. \n\nYou probably wonder why I entitled my review the way it is entitled, as long as no specific negative aspects have been presented so far. Well, it\u2019s time to reveal something very interesting that I have spotted recently. If what I\u2019m about to say has already been written in any other Dream Theater reviews, I pray for forgiveness. What the Fuck is The Shattered Fortress supposed to mean? Does not anyone see that this song is useless on this record? It consists 80% of its length of pieces taken from other Dream Theater songs: The Prison Glass, This Dying Soul, Root of All Evil and Repentance. How is it possible to put an almost 13 minute long song in there, so that you can fill an album, a progressive metal album? So, The Shattered Fortress is not even a filler, it\u2019s worse than that! But, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising, as Dream Theater has got us used to such kind of \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d since 2003. If you listen more attentively to This Dying Soul from Train of Thought, you\u2018ll realize that it resembles somehow to The Glass Prison. The middle sections of both these two songs are very similar, the same in fact. Further more, if you pay a little attention to Root of All Evil from Octavarium, you\u2019ll realize that it includes some musical parts and even lyrics from This Dying Soul. Going on, I can tell the same thing about Repentance, from Systematic Chaos. It is based on the same notes that can be found in This Dying Soul. And now, the surveillance plane has arrived in Black Clouds. What do you know? The Shattered Fortress overcomes the other impostors. This time, we don\u2019t deal with a song taking some other parts from only one song. The Shattered Fortress hanged This Dying Soul and took its liver out. Then it decapitated Root of All Evil and took its brain out. Afterwards, it crucified Repentance and takes its soul out. Eventually, it stabbed The Glass Prison into the heart and rooted it out. This is how The Shattered Fortress was born, desecrating other desecrators. Is this a bad joke? You really wanted to revenge The Glass Prison? Is this the last song that will be structured in such a way? Or the next album will reveal yet another hideous monster that feeds on the past in order to secure its present and future? Why don\u2019t you copy Metropolis Pt 1? Why don\u2019t you copy all your first three albums?\n\nThe special edition contains two more discs. Disc 2 consists of 6 covers. They are averagely well done. I\u2019m not getting into it too much. And the last disc\u2026.is this really a surprise? Or you want to compensate the fact that you strongly lack of originality? The last disc consists of the instrumental songs of the first disc. Black Clouds and Silver Linings goes speechless, I suppose. \n\nAs a conclusion, Black Clouds and Silver Linings isn\u2019t a bad album, but due to the fact that The Shattered Fortress is there as an offense to any Dream Theater fan or admirer, I can\u2019t rate the album higher. I\u2019m really sorry about The Count of Tuscany and the other 4 songs on this record. They cannot overcome the greatness of When Dream and Day Unite, Images and Words and Awake, but still, they are good and worth listening. I\u2019m sure that anyone who loves Dream Theater will have to bear to listen to The Shattered Fortress as well. There\u2019s a very fine comparison to explain this kind of attachment. A woman that truly loves her husband, she will love him for ever, even if he sometimes comes drunk home late at night and beats her up and then fucks her up till she fades. Dream Theater fans feel the same when encountering This Dying Soul, Root of All Evil, Repentance and The Shattered Fortress. Try not to copy your own songs anymore, guys! Be honest to yourself! Don\u2019t regurgitate the food you have already crapped out.\n",
        "\nBlack Clouds and Silver Linings is Dream Theater being Dream Theater. Portnoy, Petrucci, Myung, and Rudess are still masters, and yes, James LaBrie still sings for them (for better or worse). They are still the same band that created epics such as \u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d, \u201cOctovarium\u201d, \u201cLearning to Live\u201d, and many more before that. It should come as no surprise that four of the six songs on this album are over the ten minute mark, the longest of which is \u201cThe Count of Tuscany\u201d clocking in at over nineteen minutes! They have a flair for the epic, and have created a solid album full of them.\n\nThe album starts off with quite possibly the heaviest track Dream Theater has ever written, \u201cA Nightmare to Remember.\u201d Mike Portnoy really lets loose on this one with a ton of double bass. It is probably the most dynamic song on the album. It has several twists and turns, including a nice melodic middle section. The only thing I am really curious about is the spoken word passage at the end. I don\u2019t think Portnoy\u2019s vocals sound very good, but it is still a great song nonetheless. \n\nThe other highlights for me are the last two songs, \u201cThe Best of Times\u201d and \u201cThe Count of Tuscany.\u201d The former is a tribute to Mike Portnoy\u2019s father who passed away late last year. This song is lyrically upbeat, but all over the place musically. The outstanding achievement on this album is certainly the epic closer, \u201cThe Count of Tuscany.\u201d This song runs the gamut, from the clean intro, to the really cool ambient section in the middle, all the way to the triumphant ending. There is even a nice vocal hook in the song. Petrucci\u2019s outro solo is quite possibly his best ever. They could not have closed this album with a better song. Despite all the good this album has to offer, there are a couple noticeable flaws.\n\nLike \u201cSystematic Chaos\u201d, this album contains two songs clearly meant for the label to use as singles. \u201cA Rite of Passage\u201d is generic and forgettable in the same way that \u201cForsaken\u201d was. \u201cWither\u201d is probably my least favorite Dream Theater song. It is an awful power ballad with incredibly stupid lyrics. Sure, they have done good ballads such as \u201cOne Last Time\u201d and \u201cThe Spirit Carries On.\u201d This one, however, completely misses the mark. It wouldn\u2019t be out of place on \u201cFalling Into Infinity.\u201d It is a blemish on an otherwise good album.\n\nThis is easily the best Dream Theater album since \u201cScenes From a Memory.\u201d It does not flow as well because of the weak songs sandwiched in the middle, but has plenty to like. Overall, I feel this is one of their best CDs ever.\n",
        "\nDream Theater has received a lot of crap from fans and others alike in recent years. I'll admit, I even have lost interest in their whereabouts at times, but there isn't a single album by them I can honestly say is bad. That trend continues with their latest,  Black Clouds and Silver Linings.\n\nRight from the beginning, with \"A Nightmare to Remember\" the sound is perfect, the instruments compliment each other, and there is some very strong harmony, as well as a lot of interesting tehcniques on the drums, compliments of Mr. Portnoy. It's obvious the guys have been listening to quite a bit of Opeth these days, as their influence comes quite clear in this opening track. While Portnoy's drums are solid, his increasingly abundant stabs at singing are still awful, and we, as the listeners, are subjected to a decent chunk of the song featuring the man himself singing solo, and trying to sound as tough as possible. It's absolutely terrible, but aside from this, the song is one of their best.\n\nSpeaking of the vocals, I have to admit, they could've used some work. James LaBrie is often considered the weakest link, but I've always maintained that he IS the voice of Dream Theater, and I've been very pleased with his work on each and every release so far. Yet here, for some reason, he just sounds worse somehow. It sounds like they chose to not layer his voice nearly as much as they've done in the past, instead opting for backing vocals on the part of Petrucci and Portnoy. This comes off as very weak, and his vocal melodies as a whole are a lot less emotional and powerful as they sound be. This is only minor, however, as he still sounds great, but probably could've sounded better.\n\n\"A Rite of Passage\", and \"Wither\" are considerable different than the opener. The former is a nice addition to the album; very catchy, sick solo, and rather memorable. In fact, aside from the verse, which has a little too much going on with the added effects in my opinion, the song is fantastic. I wish I could say the same for \"Wither\". This review might have been a 97 if not for this song. It's cheesy, it's generic, and it sounds like crappy filler for a mainstream rock band. It is easily amongst the worst the band has ever recorded. I've always enjoyed Dream Theater' ballads, as they usually try to bring something more to the table than just being a \"soft song for the ladies\", kind of approach. \"Wither\" isn't even at that status. It's bland, it's typical, the lyrics suck, and above all, it's just fucking boring.\n\nThe rest of the album is fantastic, however. \"The Shattered Fortress\" is a magnificent closer to the Twelve-Step-Suite, although it is probably their most UNoriginal song, as it's basically riffs and lyrics from the other installments played slightly differently. It's still very good, however, and another Highlight of the album. \"The Best of Times\" is a great song, but I have to say that it didn't click with me as much as the others. It's still a good listen, and definitely solid. That brings us to the end, with \"The Count of Tuscany\". I have to say, DT's lyrics have gone downhill in a while, as have their song titles. I wasn't expecting much out of this one, but goddamn, it blew me away. The first half is just incredible, and features LaBrie's best vocals on the album by far. The second half tones itself down a little bit, and might get a little boring, but it brings itself to a beautiful close. At the end of it, you know that you've just listened to a good fucking CD. It's sure to be remembered as one of the better additions to their catalogue. While I liked Systematic Chaos, this blows it out of the water, and will hopefully be called into the setlist often from now on.\n",
        "\n...You Won't be Pleased with Anything.\n\nSince Dream Theater's \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" many naysayers have complained of the latest albums made by the band; 'Train of Thought' being too boring, 'Octavarium' being too commercial, and 'Systematic Chaos' being too \"dull\". In my opinion, none of those albums was bad, in fact, they were masterpieces. But then we find \"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\", and let me tell you, if you're not pleased with what this album has to offer, you won't be pleased with anything that DT releases after this. Metal Fans are too complex: when a band continues with their style along their albums, their reviews are called \"More of the Same\" however, if they change their ways and decide to experiment, the reviews are instead called \"Why didn't they stick to their old ways?\" and none of this arguments is valid when it comes out to review this album. So let's begin with the Album to see why:\n\n\"A Nightmare to Remember\" opens, and in an awesome way. A heavy riff with some Jordan Ruddess' synthetizer notes. James LaBrie singing styles in this song are low toned, and fit perfectly in the song. It specially makes me think what would happen if \"Awake\"'s mysterious atmosphere, \"Systematic Chaos\" melodies and \"Train of Thought\" heaviness were merged together and synchronized in a new, but spectacular song. The only thing that I found annoying was Mike Portnoy's singing part.... it didn't fit anywhere. Portnoy might be good doing backing vocals, but he looks absolutely ridiculous when he does main vocals. Good Ruddess-Petrucci solo, and is a sign of how progressive this band can get (In fact, the tempo-changing parts make up the awful Portnoy-singing part). \"A Rite of Passage\" is next. At first it seemed like an average song. Nothing special, good chorus, good vocals. Until the tempo changes and the solos apear. I can swear that this part is the one that sticks you into the entire song. It makes the first part appear attractive, and the rest of the song appear awesome. \"Wither\" follows. A good ballad, and reminds me of the \"Falling into Infinity\" days. It is almost perfect: Good singing, good melody, good solo, good drums. The Keyboards might be a little missing in this song, but it doesn't make a big difference. \n\n\"The Shattered Fortress\", the next song, is the last song from the \"Twelve-Step Suite\" which started with \"The Glass Prison\". In my opinion, this is the best final part that the Twelve-Step Suite could ever get. Glass Prison references are everywhere, nonetheless it has its own melody and style. The drums of this song left me astounded, and it's a great evidence of Portnoy's drumming skills nowadays. An awesome Petrucci-Ruddess solo again like in The Glass Prison is present in this song. The Repentance-like spoken part in the middle of the song is kind of boring, but it isn't a long part.\n\n\"The Best of Times\" is a rare but somewhat soothing ballad. Reminds me of the soft part of \"Octavarium\" At first it has nothing special to offer and it stays that way for the first 2 minutes, but then it turns out to be a really emotive and powerful song. Unlike \"A Nightmare to Remember\" Portnoy does good backing vocals on this song. But what I found best is John Petrucci's solo, one of his best in the last decade. It seems that he's playing with his soul instead of his hands, and that solo, in part, saved the rest of the song. An emotive, good masterpiece overall. \"The Count of Tuscany\" is, by far, the most progressive Dream Theater-ish track of the song. The lyrics aren't good, but the music itself is stunning, making it a 20 minutes masterpiece. Jordan Ruddess work stands out in this song (Specially in the relaxing, soft part), as well as James' vocals. An awesome way to end an awesome album.\n\nOverall, this is a very well balanced album. Soft parts, heavy parts, loud vocals, low vocals, it has everything that Dream Theater has to offer. The dedication from Octavarium, the technique from \"Systematic Chaos\", the heaviness from \"Train of Thought\", and a special, \"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\" sound that makes it unique. This special balance between tradition and experimentation makes this album another masterpiece made by DT, and maybe their best album in the last decade.\n",
        "\nWell isn\u2019t this a pleasant surprise! I had thought that the only metal bands that were allowed to cover Queen were power metal bands looking for a way to satisfy their addiction to densely layered vocal parts and dramatic guitar solos. Even then, the only exception I can think of is Metallica\u2019s cover of \u201cStone Cold Crazy\u201d which, like everything else Metallica did during the 90\u2019s, is pretty cringe worthy.\n\nBut I was wrong, for here we are with a trio of Queen covers done by none other than progressive metal giants Dream Theater. For a band that seems to have been trying to court the metal side of their fan base for the past few years (see The Dark Eternal Night and Constant Motion for reference) this is a pretty ballsy move. Of course they\u2019ve averted most of the backlash by staying away from Queen\u2019s poppier synth oriented later period (although I\u2019m sure DT fans would love Innuendo). Instead they\u2019ve chosen a song cycle from the band\u2019s heavier and more progressive early period.\n\nAnyone with even a passing awareness with Dream Theater\u2019s music probably won\u2019t be surprised to find that these songs are even more grandiose than the original recordings. Tenement Funster, originally a relaxed acoustic track, is pumped up into a rock anthem, the chorus riff especially grooves like a motherfucker and ends up sounding more akin to Black Sabbath than to Queen. Mike Portnoy\u2019s backup vocals, which on their own are decent but nothing special, sound bizarrely anachronistic when put against such an aggressive and modern setting.\n\nIf Tenement Funster is an anthem, than Flick of the Wrist is an absolute monster. Already heavy by Queen standards, the song is transformed into a menacing and snarling beast. Petrucci\u2019s smaller guitar fills add to unnerving atmosphere by taking Brian May\u2019s already impressive guitar playing and adding an eastern twist. Portnoy also goes absolutely bonkers with the double bass near the end.\n\nClosing off the medley is Lily of the Valley, a piano and vocal number. James LaBrie is a very hit and miss vocalist, but in this case he knocks it out of the park. All of Freddie Mercury\u2019s trills and high notes are replicated perfectly, although this version lacks the lush backing vocals of the original. This is easily the strongest cover of the bunch so far, and I would highly recommend it to DT fans, Queen fans, and prog fans in general.\n",
        "\nDream Theater are a band of many talents and wonders. Their ambition has always fueled them to go to greater heights, and after the monolithic Awake topped the seminal Images and Words in epic scope and artistic vision, where could they possibly go next? Well, apparently the answer to that in 1997 was Falling into Infinity, which I still haven't heard in its entirety, but what came after that? I guess they didn't like the accusations of commerciality against them on that record, so they went with a complete 180 and released this, the most bloated and sprawling thing anyone had ever heard in metal. There is epic, there is canonical, there is planet-sized and then there is Scenes from a Memory, and all it really does is put me to sleep.\n\nI mean, how am I supposed to enjoy this? It's like Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime multiplied by three, the most excessive and floridly proggy album the band ever recorded. It's boring. Nothing on here really kicks up much excitement, no matter how many notes they can play per minute or how many drum fills they can put in a four minute song before they stretch it out to eight minutes. There is some sort of conceptual storyline here, but frankly, it doesn't sound very good, and even if it were, it wouldn't save this stinker much. This album is almost impossible to listen to in one sitting, and this is coming from the guy who just sat through Tribuzy's musical torture chamber of fuckery. Dream Theater, I think you deserve some sort of commendment for that.\n\nSo the album starts off with an introduction piece, with the sound of a clock ticking and a man narrating calmly, telling us to close our eyes, take a deep breath and relax. Preparing us for the grueling chore ahead of us, perhaps? Well, whatever. \"Overture 1928\" is next, and it's another intro piece. I really don't get why bands would ever do this - one introduction piece is more than enough! To be fair, though, this is the best song on the album, with some rumbling guitar progressions and some nice build-ups. It's really all downhill from here, though, so grab your pillows and your sleeping pills and try not to hit your head on the floor when you go down.\n\nThere is really not a lot wrong with this that I can't say would also be wrong with the other Dream Theater albums, it's just that this one doesn't seem to have the emotional intensity of some of the later stuff or the exciting grandeur of Images and Words. I'm not the biggest fan of Awake either, as it just left me cold, but this is just ridiculous - it is so elaborate and mechanical that it might as well have been made by a fucking computer in itself. This has a lot of bells and whistles, and the songwriting is certainly complex, but it's too hollow, skimping out on the more personal feel that the Dream Theater songs I like have. I think another thing wrong with this is the way all of the songs are sort of seamlessly connected - this makes them feel much longer than they should, as they don't seem to have any veritable starting or ending points. It is easy to see the intention here, but it doesn't work.\n\nOh, and \"Finally Free\" is probably the worst Dream Theater song ever. Completely enervated, painful crap with some truly awful, awful vocals. Good god, this sucks.\n\nThis album fails to incite any emotional response, and so despite whatever nonsensical reasons people have for liking this, it's not worth picking up. Avoid.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nAs the first of five bonus covers recorded in conjunction with the upcoming Dream Theater album, this version of Stargazer is competent and entertaining, but nothing truly amazing.\n\nAs one would expect from a band made up of Berklee and Julliard alumni the cover is, not counting the solo section, a note for note reproduction of the original song. This being Dream Theater, the individual performances are unsurprisingly solid. Mike Portnoy nails the opening fill and avoids over playing for the rest of the tune while still keeping a very solid groove. Jordan Rudess indulges in some absurdly huge keyboard sounds, but for the most part provides atmosphere and mood instead of drowning the track in synth leads. John Petrucci delivers a strong performance during the majority of the song, but makes some controversial choices once he gets to his solo spot. The new guitar solo, while not as overbearing as say \u201cIn the Name of God\u201d or \u201cThe Glass Prison\u201d is still very much a Petrucci guitar solo. Those who aren\u2019t fans of his style will most likely be furious to see him zip across the song at top speed, but for the legions of shred hungry Dream Theater fans out there, this is sure to be a nice addition. I personally prefer Blackmore\u2019s performance, but Petrucci\u2019s solo is by no means bad. John Myung, as per usual in modern Dream Theater albums is nowhere to be heard.\n\nThe main differences between this cover and the original can be found in the vocals and the production. Anyone with half an ear knows that James LaBrie is no Ronnie James Dio. Even taking into account that LaBrie is a respectable and talented vocalist, and that he sounds more passionate and invigorated here than he has in over a decade, no one comes close to the diminutive demigod. That said LaBrie seems to have fully recovered from his vocal problems that were plaguing him for the better part of the decade. There is an edge to his vocals during the verses that have not been felt since the \u201cAwake\u201d era. However, and this holds true for the rest of the band, not matter how hard he attempts to nail the pitches and mannerisms, he cannot avoid the fact that this is merely a cover. While the performances are dead on, the magic and immersion found in the original track are drastically reduced due to the extremely modern production and the unavoidable fact that this is Dream Theater and not Rainbow.\n\nThe picture provided by the Dream Theater telescope is certainly pretty, and will definitely build anticipation for the soon to be released \u201cBlack Clouds & Silver Linings\u201d, but nothing shines as bright as the original recording.\n",
        "\nA Rite Of Passage is the first single released off of the new Dream Theater album, Black Clouds and Silver Linings. It is a fairly long song, at 8:48, however never gets boring.\n\nThe song opens up with a great melodic riff, showcasing Petrucci's guitar skill. After this intro the song goes into the first verse, which is the only weak part of the song. James Labrie's vocals sound fine on this verse; however the echoing background vocals seem somewhat out of place and distracting. After the verse the song goes into the superb sing-along chorus. After this the second verse comes in, which thankfully does not have the distracting background vocals. After the second chorus the song breaks into the solo, which opens up with a great thrashy riff, which then leads into a fantastic solo by Petrucci and Rudess. The solo is about two minutes long and features fantastic tradeoffs between Petrucci soloing on the guitar, and Rudess soloing on the Keyboard. The solo is one of my new favorite Dream Theater solos and one of their best in a long time. After this the song goes back into the chorus one more time and then ends with the main riff played with voices in the background.\n\nAll in all a great new song with very few weak parts in it. Definitely a good choice for a single off of Black Clouds and Silver Linings and has really got me excited for the new cd.\n",
        "\nSubject to much controversy amongst both the metal scene and Dream Theater's fans, Train of Thought is often seen as the bastard-child of the DT discography. In some ways that statement bears true as this is their most visceral and heavy affair, vastly different to any release in their discography. Leading me nicely into why this album is both maligned and revered the world over. Due to its much heavier sound than previous releases, use of more conventional vocal lines and the largely offending \"rap\" moment press and fan-boys alike spat Nu-Metal accusations left right and centre. The true fans as well as the more open-minded of us praised this for both its artistic merit, and the bold step into new horizons. However from a marketing stand-point the controversy surrounding this release would result in a quality PR plan, driving Dream Theater's music into the masses of Disturbed T-shirt-spiked hair-nail varnish wearing-posers (Trust me I witnessed it first hand). Which ultimately gained them a host of fans \u2013 of course in turn this dissuaded the posers from the tripe dominating their MP3 players, turning them onto real metal acts. \n\n\nInitially I was scared away from the middle era Dream Theater albums, due to conflicting reviews, cries of selling out and that common assumption that these guys hide behind lengthy instrumentals, and virtuoso musicianship to cover up the fact they no longer bear any song-writing credibility. Now I'll be the first to admit that throughout the years these guys have made some rough choices, the odd bad approach has been taken, and of course some things just don't gel. However it's the plain and simple fact that these guys take those kinds of risks with each and every release in pursuit of diversity and creativity. The Dream Theater back catalogue is a formidable collection of tracks tailored to appease any audience they may face. \n\n\nAs previously stated Train of Thought is Dream Theater's most metal release to date, a release that in my eyes worked a treat. From the ominous intro to \"As I Am\" we're treated once again to a darker sound from these guys, John Petrucci's guitar tone is sublime, complementing the down-tuning of his guitar \u2013 never becoming too sludgy. Probably the most accessible track these guys recorded since \"Pull Me Under\", \"As I Am\" quickly became a fan favorite \u2013especially amongst the more metal-inclined fans. Next up is the biggest offender with the naysayers, a continuation of Mike Portnoy's alcoholics anonymous suite, the sublime \"This Dying Soul\" raging through the speakers with stupendous guitar solos and Portnoy's ever identifiable drum-work. Obviously it's not until further into the track where we see what had fans spitting their tea over their computer screens, the much maligned \"rap\" part. Honestly it's really not that bad; if you can let Daniel Gildenl\u00f6w get with staccato vocals I'm sure you can forgive LaBrie. Another point worth noting is the nods to the first part of the suite \"The Glass Prison\" where you can hear some of the riffs (something that would continue through consecutive releases). A personal highpoint of the release is the stunning \"Honor Thy Father\" certainly one of their finer cuts to date \u2013 an unforgiving romp with superior arrangement.\n\n\n\"Vacant\" serves up a short ballad - just how they should be, quick and painless. Leading into the final part of the album, the lengthy instrumental \"Stream Of Consciousness\" which despite its enormous length still proves an entertaining listen and album closer \"In The Name of God\" - a damn cool track, displaying the finer vocal work and arrangements on Train of Thought. The biggest issue I have with this release is that it's lacking in the keyboards department, something I've always deemed a high point in my Dream Theater listening. However the moody piano work is very suitable, helping to further the dark soundscape across the release. Strictly speaking I find it hard to see much wrong with Train of Thought. The Nu Metal accusations reek of bullshit, this is 100% metal albeit with a slight modern twist to it. I commend DT for this release, an essential release in a back catalogue full of essential releases. Dream Theater never fails to please \u2013 just some albums please more than others. Train of Thought is a very good release that should be embraced without allegations and expectations.\n\n\nOriginally written for www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nDream Theater as a band are truly a respectable outfit. Whether you like them or not, it is pretty much undeniable that they have kept evolving in a truly soldier-like fashion throughout the years, sometimes even using current trends to their advantage. This is a band that can truly do what they want, and it's impossible to say that anything they do is \"not Dream Theater\" because of this. This brings me to their latest full length offering Systematic Chaos, which, as all of Dream Theater's best albums do, has inspired a world of controversy amongst anyone who is enough of an asshole to voice their opinion on the internet.\n\nThis album is less graceful and emotional than the previous Octavarium, focusing mostly on heavily progressive songs with long durations and a lot of bells and whistles, but not much of the so-called technical wankery that so many of the band's detractors often accuse them of. The songs here flow like the white water rapids, the band jumping through musical and songwriting hoops with relative ease. Yes, the technical proficiency of the notorious band members is heavy here as always, but the band strings their songs together with a sort of curiosity and adventurousness that makes them easy to enjoy and digest with a few listens. There is a lot of confidence at work here, the sound of a band that knows what they're doing and has been doing it for a long, long time, and I like that.\n\nKicking off with the truly mountainous \"In the Presence of Enemies part 1,\" Dream Theater show that they have no intention of slowing down yet. The song moves through some dark, somber instrumental work before it reaches the halfway mark, where James LaBrie's charismatic whine makes its appearance with a stirring build up to the great, hooky chorus line. \"Forsaken\" shows the more commercial side of the band with a big chorus and some delicate opening piano lines. One song that everyone seems to love to criticize is \"Constant Motion\" for its slightly Thrashy overtones in the crunching guitars, and I guess I can see that; it's certainly the worst song on this album, but I kind of like it anyway. \"Prophets of War\" is the other weaker song, a propulsive and catchy number that seems dwarfed within the cataclysmic gulfs that the longer tracks around it create.\n\n\"The Dark Eternal Night\" is probably my favorite of the bunch, as it is just a stellar song with a host of unsavory and yet deliciously progressive musical ideas ranging from bouncy swing to huge Heavy Metal riffage, all coming together for a damn near orgasmic composition that I will never tire of. \"Repetence\" is a bit slower and maybe a tad over-long, but the emotional, soaring leads will make you forget that instantly. \"The Ministry of Souls\" is a real gem, with its foreboding air and balladesque beginning chords exploding into a hugely gratifying experience that you will want to return to again and again, and in \"In the Presence of Enemies part 2,\" we see the band propelling forward with an insane and wondrous concoction of musical bliss to end this album in style. Get this if you like good Progressive Metal - it might just surprise you.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.metalcrypt.com\n",
        "\nBefore I get to my bashing, let me just say that \"In the Presence of Enemies\" and \"Ministry of Lost Souls\" are fucking great songs. Let me also say that despite all this controversy, I love some of Dream Theater's releases. Images & Words is one of my favorite albums ever, Awake is incredible and Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory is just outstanding. Shit, I even enjoy Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence more than most people. I even liked them enough to go see the Score concert live.\n\nThat being said...what the fuck were they thinking? I was actually pretty excited to see that they split up their epics for a change. I thought \"oh, maybe it will sort of be like Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd.\" Obviously I didn't expect it to be as good, but I thought maybe that sort of approach would be intriguing. I can now safely admit that I was beyond wrong.\n\nWell, this album starts off pretty solid with \"In the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 1\" and ends on an even better note with \"In the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2\", but everything in between other than \"Ministry of Lost Souls\" is just shit. We're off to a bad start with \"Forsaken,\" and it's incredibly irritatingly pop chorus. I don't care what people say, \"Constant Motion\" is a Metallica cover with a different title and done a lot worse. James LaBrie wasn't meant to sing in a thrash style like James Hetfield. Nothing against him, it's just not something he was meant to do. \"Dark Eternal Night\" is just embarrassingly cheesy, stereotypical metal. There's not even a reason to mention \"Repentance\" and \"Prophets of War\" is just a really bad, preachy Muse song. Oh, and all those people who claim Dream Theater to have overlong, emotionless, solos that don't serve any purpose but to show off...congratulations. Dream Theater has finally provided you with an album that perfectly portrays this image. Enjoy using Systematic Chaos as your prime example in future Dream Theater bashing.\n\nNow to the good stuff. \"Ministry of Lost Souls\" is actually a very touching song with lyrics that don't suck (*cough* Dark Eternal Night *cough). I would even go as far to say that it's one of my favorite Dream Theater songs out of their past three or four albums. Yes, as stated before some of the soloing is unnecessary and obnoxious, but even so, it is quite enjoyable on this song more so than others. My main complaint about the solo in this particular song is that it is a little bit too intense and random for the calmness of the song before the solo kicks in. Finally, we have our closing track, \"In the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2.\" Not much to say about this song except it kicks ass and works as a somewhat dark epic. Though the song \"Octavarium\" is still a much better epic than \"In the Presence of Enemies\" is.\n\nYes, every member in Dream Theater is unbelievably talented at their instruments. Yes, their older work DID have a fuck ton of emotion and true feelings involved in their music, but that doesn't mean it does anymore. Unfortunately, it seems that Dream Theater is getting noticeably older. LaBrie doesn't sound as powerful as he used to and the rest of the band has resorted to random jam sessions in the middle of their songs that wear their influences on their sleeves. Get Images & Words. If you have Images & Words, then get Awake or Metropolis Pt. 2. If you Have those get Six Degrees, and stop there. For fuck's sake, just don't get this!\n",
        "\nThis album is beautiful. If Dream Theater themselves called me on the phone and told me I was allowed to change one thing about Images & Words, I wouldn't. It is an untouchable masterpiece that any prog metal artist (except for maybe Opeth's Still Life) has yet to surpass. I first heard this record about six or seven years ago and it forever changed my opinion about music. Dark Side of the Moon may have been the first progressive rock album that I absolutely loved, but Images & Words is the prog album that broke me out of my ignorant music listening world. Everyone in the band is at the their most experimental, technically talented, and emotionally powerful state in their career.\n\nThere is much talk about Dream Theater being very pretentious and soloing for the sake of showing off their individual talents while the music remains soulless. If they were referring to Train of Thought, Systematic Chaos or some other Dream Theater release then I would absolutely agree with them. But I don't think anyone can tell you that they were not moved by the instrumentals in \"Metropolis Pt .1\", \"Under A Glass Moon\", or \"Another Day.\" There is so much emotion within each one of these songs that you can't help but feel moved. Unfortunately, it seems that LaBrie became much worse with age, but his range back in 1992 is unheard of. He hits high notes I didn't even know existed, without sounding incredibly irritating like Dani Filth.\n\nAs I have stated endlessly, Mike Portnoy is my favorite drummer in all of metal. If someone were to ask me why, I would tell them to listen to \"Learning to Live.\" If someone were to ask me why Myung is one of my favorite bassists and lyricists in metal, I would once again tell them to listen to \"Learning to Live.\" I dare you to put all of your emotion into every line as Myung has for this song: \"Another chance to life my life, Free the sensation in my heart, To ride the wings of dreams into changed horizons, It brings inner peace within my mind, As I'm lifted from where I've split my life, I hear an innocent voice, I hear kindness, beauty and truth.\" And yes, it sounds a billion times more powerful when paired up with LaBrie's flawless vocals.\n\nThere is not one song where Moore's or Petrucci's soloing sound out of place or overlong on this entire album. I cannot say as much for Petrucci's later work, but on Images & Words he perfectly balances his technical skill, pure emotion, and appropriate time lengths. Every single note sounds unbelievably powerful. Yes, \"Pull Me Under\" was played on MTV and was their hit single, but it is unlike anything off of Falling Into Infinity. It is not poppy nor out of place with the rest of the album. In fact, it fits in wonderfully.\n\nThe album has a consistent jazzy, majestic feel to it throughout. It is incredibly unique to any genre of music and I recommend it to anyone who isn't deaf. This album is just as essential to music as any album recorded by Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, or any other musical artist that you can think of that has had a major impact on music. If you haven't already, get this album as soon as possible. I warn you though, this may make you cry because of how stunningly outstanding it is. If only I could rate this higher than 100%.\n\nHighlights: Everything. Okay, fine- \"Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper\", \"Under a Glass Moon\", \"Learning to Live\"\n",
        "\nFor any familiar with Dream Theater\u2019s extensive history as the most influential force in the 1990s progressive metal scene, this album is always seen as the turning point towards the high period that the genre enjoyed throughout the decade. I\u2019ve always likened this scene\u2019s activity as a sort of aristocrat\u2019s revolution against the tyranny of mainstream music at the time. It contrasts from the minority populist revolution concurrent in the extreme metal scenes of black and death metal in that instead of decrying a lack of legitimate aggression and discord in the general music scene, it was appalled by the utter idiocy that was passing for art, wishing instead to explore the possibilities yet untapped in both lyrical and instrumental composition work. Thus instead of grabbing the torches and household weapons to have a good old glam/grunge rocker lynching, bands like this one elected simply to treat mainstream sentiments with a quiet aura of apathy.\n\nThis apathy is expressed through a simple concept, and that is writing songs based on what the song requires rather than what fits into a 3 minute, 45 second block of time on the radio waves. Songs are both long and short for the sake of painting an elaborate musical picture and articulating thoughtfulness through whatever subject fit\u2019s the sounds it accompanies, hence the name \u201cImages And Words\u201d. The lyrics have both a keen sense of descriptiveness, particularly when dealing with the details of the song\u2019s setting and the interaction of the subject\u2019s character. The vocal melodies and performance play off the mathematical precision of the accompanying rhythmic figures as raw emotion does with logical discourse, resulting in an all too human sound (apologies to Nietzsche for the partial paraphrase).\n\nThe reason why the non-conformity that this album comes across as more of an indifference towards convention rather than outright hatred for this is that despite being unapologetically unsuited for universal accessibility, it does not openly seek to make itself inaccessible. Many of the themes presented in here are quite catchy, though they do take some effort to get into. The production is clean and polished enough to pass for a more elaborate version of Rush\u2019s \u201cGrace Under Pressure\u201d or Queensryche\u2019s \u201cRage For Order\u201d. Likewise, the instrumental work on here is quite involved, but never crossed into being overbearing or pretentious. But most of all, despite often clocking in at over 8 minutes half of the time, there is a clear effort at maintaining an actual song oriented composition style, rather than an attempt to outright shun a larger audience with too much music to follow.\n\nThe most difficult music to really get into on here is when the band really stretches the genre boundaries and tries to compress about 3 or 4 stylistic fusions into 9 or 10 minutes of music. This is particularly the case with \u201cMetropolis - Part 1 \u201cThe Miracle And The Sleeper\u201d, where ambient keyboard work, jazzy interludes, off beat and quasi-tribal sounding drumming, and a rather large collection of memorable riffs all find a happy home. Things remain relatively easy to follow until about halfway into the song where things just completely change feel and we\u2019re introduced to a Rush interlude on steroids. This approach to a contrasting instrumental section after a series of discernable verse and chorus themes is as old as the earliest of Baroque era compositions, although when presented in an extremely complex manner, is usually lost on most who have less than a regular interest in instrumental music. This same fact holds true for the even longer \u201cLearning To Live\u201d, only at a slightly longer duration with a less chaotic sense of rhythm.\n\nWhere the band really shines yet also maintains a stronger sense of accessibility is on the shorter and simpler epics. \u201cPull Me Under\u201d is the catchiest and the most remembered of this album\u2019s 8 parts, but is really no less complex than any of the others on here. It works a little easier than the others in that it concentrates on a more gradual development of ideas and avoids too much stylistic variance. The principle theme that kicks off the song is heavily reminiscent of Queensryche, droning on a simple clean guitar line as everything around it develops into a fast paced, heavy edged riff monster. The chorus just saturates itself in catchiness, anchoring the song in a sense of balance that is utterly undisturbed by Mike Portnoy\u2019s perpetually developing beats. This same approach holds true on my personal favorite song on here \u201cUnder A Glass Moon\u201d, but with a more abstract sounding principle melody that likely inspired a couple of Symphony X songs, most particularly \u201cThe Relic\u201d and \u201cThrough The Looking Glass\u201d off the \u201cTwilight In Olympus\u201d release. The chorus is basically an elaborate variant on speed metal, cruising along with the double bass drums and palm muted guitars blazing as LaBrie\u2019s vocals soar like a triumphant golden eagle. But the finest moment on here, and in my own humble opinion the finest Dream Theater has ever had, is Petrucci\u2019s guitar solo. It\u2019s one of the most technically and stylistically multifaceted works of expressive lead playing ever conceived, and knows when it\u2019s time to go and leave its final impression rather than continuing to linger in hopes of outdoing itself.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve become a bit guarded about the concept of ascribing legendary status to a singular album by a band with a pretty solid total body of work, this is one of those cases where it is unavoidable. Although this is often seen as an inferior work to \u201cAwake\u201d, this is where the band truly found their niche and exploited it to its fullest, right smack in the twilight of the glory days of 80s metal. It is widely imitated by a large host of progressive and power metal bands, with varying degrees of success, and enjoys a wide audience among even those who don\u2019t care much for the bands that influenced this album. It\u2019s popularity is less a manner of the band catering to any particular collective sentiment, but more a credit to it\u2019s ability to transcend all preconceived notions of greatness.\n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on April 22, 2009\n",
        "\nThis track is one of the heavier ones from Dream Theater's discography and one of the better ones on Awake. It\u2019s about five and a half minutes long and has an extremely catchy chorus, making it one of the few Dream Theater tracks that even their haters might not mind listening to. The band sounds more matured and experienced due to the success of Images and Words. The production is of course quite polished and the mixing couldn\u2019t be better. \n\nAll instruments have been used equally in terms of quantity as well as quality. The song starts with a keyboard riff which is accompanied by power chords and typical top class Mike Portnoy drumming. As for the solo, the keyboard and guitars play it together, adding a whole new dimension and feel to it never heard before. The lyrics are quite amazing too, as can be guessed from the title of the song, very well written, proving that they are professionals not only when it comes to playing their instruments, but also when it comes to writing lyrics and composing them into a song. \n\nEveryone has had their share of Labrie problems but with time all of us have come to like this voice, so no complains. There are points where he goes higher, reminding me of that wonderful \"Watch the sparrows falling....\" part in Pull Me Under. Though he isn\u2019t able to carry it off well in live concerts.\n",
        "\nI will start by immediately clarifying that I am NOT a Dream Theater fan and, in fact, Train of Thought is their only album I really enjoy. There are songs here and there from other albums that I find myself liking, but none consistently like this one. What's more, I have little respect for the band as artists or as people. While they of course do exhibit extraordinary technical ability, I think they suck as songwriters and put no emotion into anything they do. They are also a bunch of pretentious fucks who think they are better than everyone else when they are horrifically wrong. I am willing to put all of that behind me, though, as I do enjoy Train of Thought a good bit. \n\nTrain of Thought seems to be what happened when the robot that is Dream Theater attempted to show emotion. On the upside, this resulted in them performing some very cool music, but on the downside, just like a robot, it feels very false as if they had never actually heard emotional music but had read about it and thought 'shit, I can do that.' I get the feeling that after having written this album, the band thought that they had really accomplished a career milestone and done something new and different while really all they did was play their usual progressive metal, just heavier. \n\nThe place that this is most evident is right on the first track, As I Am. If it didn't have such a long-ass intro pushing it to the 7-minute mark, this song could be considered a fairly 'normal' metal song (god knows DT probably slapped the intro on just so that it WOULDN'T be a normal metal song.) It's got a fairly easy structure of verses, choruses, and solo, and the lyrics and vocal performance are the kind you'd expect out of a metal song. It's a 'single' you could say, with the DT twist on it. However, it absolutely reeks of trying too hard, especially in the vocal department. The vocalist does all that he can to sound tough and fails miserably while spouting bullshit horrible lyrics like a fucking Trivium album. The song isn't bad, and it's still fun, and you still may even sing along, but you'll do so knowing just how forced it feels. While the rest of the album immediately goes into total what-the-fuck songwriting structure, the forced emotion is ever-present. \n\nBefore I even continue, though, I'm going to bring up This Dying Soul and the album's two and a half minute little insert, Vacant. Neither of these songs is, in my opinion, worth getting into. Vacant just because it's a tiny ballad thrown onto the album for no immediately evident reason. This Dying Soul because it is practically filler. It's a little bit of all the things that happen on the album, and none of it stands out here. A lot of people call this the best song on the album, but I really don't know why. The end of it and the beginning mean nothing in correlation to each other - it's just eleven minutes of who-gives-a-shit. The remaining tracks each deserve their own mentioning. \n\nEndless Sacrifice is a 7-minute guitar solo disguised as an 11-minute song. It quite literally is a soft ballad for five minutes, and then a much more heavy and energetic guitar solo for the next seven minutes. The five minute 'intro' as I'd like to call it could be done without. It's too long for being the intro that it is and it's quite fucking boring. If it had been maybe two minutes long it would have been fine, though still hard to care about, but as it stands, there's no reason not to just skip to the guitar solo. This is, in fact, the best guitar solo on the album in my opinion. It doesn't necessarily make much sense, as Dream Theater solos are usually just an experiment to see how many time signature changes the guitarists and keyboardist can play while drums go batshit nuts. However, this solo is fun and just works plus has some 'just for the hell of it' noises thrown in that I can't really bitch about. The song also has a pretty great climax that is always a little surprising when the other lyrics in the song were so shitty. \n\nHonor Thy Father is easily my favorite song on the album and the most (see: only) consistent one. The song is heavy, visceral, angry, and just quite damn good. For once, it actually feels at all times like you really are listening to the same song. Being ten minutes long (as usual) there are parts that aren't as good as others (the verses, mostly) but most of it works pretty well. Like in As I Am, there is some real bullshit attempt at emotional vocals, but it works a little better this time with the mix with regular singing and some almost hilarious but fun lyrics (how do you even sleep a wink at night pretending that everything is alright and have the balls to blame this shit on me?) The real money here, though, is the guitar/keyboard solo/musical interlude/whatever the fuck it is in which a whole lot of movie quotes are dubbed over the music at varying volumes and left-right justifications while the riffs become more and more intense and dramatic. It's the best experimental bit the album over and very memorable. Easily the album highlight. \n\nStream of Consciousness is, in my opinion, a 12-minute shit. It's an instrumental bit that is something akin to five guys standing in a circle over a recording device and just masturbating. It's a giant-ass guitar solo completely lacking in attractiveness - unemotional, unmemorable, not fun to listen to, and without purpose. When this song ends, I usually don't even realize it had began. Is it insanely technical? Oh you fucking bet. Do the band members probably think it's the greatest thing ever and listen to it while having sex? Very likely. It's still shit, though. \n\nIn the Name of God, the 14-minute album closer, is another one of the band's 'attempts', this time to make something only describable as epic. Hilariously, this is done by having a completely gaudy and rediculous climax at only five minutes into the song which is repeated at the end of the song only longer and five times more gaudy. In between these is some more prog-sperimental shit that actually does work for the most part. It's easy to loose track of this song in it's crazy length and many tempo changes, but it's at least a lot of fun and the ending, in all it's gaudiness, is quite memorable. As far as 14-minute epics go, it's no And Then There Was Silence, but it's still good. \n\nAll in all, Train of Thought is fun even though it is so blatantly trying too hard - in fact that may be part of the fun itself. It's a shame that Dream Theater hasn't failed an attempt to escape it's comfort zone again and probably won't in this fashion ever, but then I really don't need two albums like this one. It may not be enough to put Dream Theater on my list of favorite bands, but it's always been one of the albums I consider amongst those I enjoy.\n",
        "\nBefore I go any further, I must add that the concept of doing a few \"normal\" songs and then doing a multi part super epic is nothing new. I know there were a few done in the 80's, but one example I can cite with certainty is Manowar's Triumph of Steel. The only difference is that Manowar were kind enough to make the super epic \"only\" 28 minutes long and make the rest of the album fit in to the whole schematic. Dream Theater feature around 40 minutes of songs that have a rather hit-and-miss quality to them as a \"super epic\". The reason I put it in quotations is because aside from dubious lyrical similarities, there is no reason to believe that they are all part of the same song. Shit, there's no reason to believe half of them are even on the same album. As well, Manowar's attempt, while not perfect, was still an actual SONG, not 8 unrelated and mediocre songs.\n\nHowever, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (the song) can be easily ignored by the action of ripping only the 2 good parts and throwing the disc into your nearest garbage receptacle. What remains is approximately 55 minutes of, again, hit-and-miss. This time, the hit-miss ratio is a bit higher on this disc. Glass Prison is a good song, even if Dream Theater do the whole \"parts\" thing again (what's wrong with simply writing a song, and letting it be at that?) and has a relentlessly pushing feel throughout the whole song. The others are a bit forgettable, for reasons I will list below. But there's few times where it's so outrageously pretentious that I feel as compelled to hit the \"skip\" button as a crack addict is compelled to smoke crack. For that reason, this effort isn't TOTAL garbage. \n\nWhy do I say this is garbage, you ask? Suppose you're a DT fan that asserts that the band reinvents music everytime they make an album. If a chef makes a dish consisting of jalapeno peppers and chocolate ice cream, that doesn't necessarily mean he's reinventing quisine. Most likely, he's created a, while not putridly offensive, rather confusing dish that insults the same senses it purports to please. He'd only be reinventing cuisine if the dish tasted goo. It's the same concept with Dream Theater here. Just because they \"broke musical boundaries\" and did things that not every band was doing doesn't mean that what they produced was worth anything. That's assuming Dream Theater broke new ground here. \n\nSee, believe it or not, I understand what Dream Theater is trying to do here. I am musically literate, and have many years as a musician under my belt. I cannot play the stuff they play, and logically, I'm not debating their technical skill as musicians and even composers. They are a well oiled machine, and writing all this shit probably took a lot of time. As much as effort means in the world of music, result is a much more important concept. It doesn't matter if you took 10 years, included a 500 piece choir/orchestra/symphony and recorded 1000000000000000000 guitar tracks and 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000 vocal tracks and 1000 different parts. If it's not listenable, it's not listenable. Thus is the delusion of Dream Theater; it's the idea that just because you crammed a whole bunch of ideas and concepts into your music it's gonna be a guarantor of quality. It's correlated, to be sure, but without proper precaution, it can come off sounding pretentious and cheesy as hell. Even then, there's a proper way to do pretentious. Ulver's Blood Inside is pretentious as hell, even I'll admit that, but I'll be damned if I don't hum along to \"For the Love of God\" or \"It Is Not Sound\". \n\nEmotion can be argued to be the centerpiece of all music, no matter what the genre. Even music that tries to convey a cold, robotic emotionlessness possesses emotion by default -- to know what emotion is not, one must know what emotion is. It's entirely different here. Emotion is simply irrelevant here. It's all plastic, lifeless, pap. Dream Theater have relied for a while on sheer technicality and a \"different for different's sake\" approach to writing songs, which leaves no room for any actual quality. While quality material will escape my speakers every so often when I put this on, it appears as if by accident, as if they threw a bunch of song ideas together haphazardly. They didn't used to be this way, back several years, when they still had Kevin Moore, in the days of \"Awake\" and \"Images and Words\". They weren't perfect, but they still devoted their energies towards creating SONGS -- songs meant to be listened to and enjoyed, not analyzed endlessly. Then they replaced him with the super-technical and super-soulless keyboardist Derek Sherinian and they recorded Falling Into Infinity, which witnessed a dramatic drop in quality. Then they kicked him out and found and EVEN MORE PRETENTIOUS keyboardist, Jordan Rudess. They have been increasingly pretentious since then. And his tenure has been marked by this philosophy that music is made to credit the musician, not the listener. I'm of the firm belief that music should be made to be enjoyed by the listener, not as a chance for arrogant musicians to show off endlessly. Why do I give high ratings to certain Yngwie albums, then? One reason:\n\nBecause Yngwie can write songs that get stuck in your head. Dream Theater haven't done that in years. In the end, it's about whether the music is a pleasure to listen to. And despite their best efforts, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a chore to listen to.\n",
        "\nI have never been a fan of Dream Theater, I think they always seem to have a very good song per album, like Pull Me Under in Images and Words, or The Glass Prison in Six Degrees...But I can't like a single full album by them, let alone worshiping it. But then, I heard this; Scenes from a Memory, and even though I basically hate everything else they've done, I not only like this, I fucking love it, it's one of my favorite albums. It's funny how the only album that I really like by Dream Theater is the one that gets bashed the most (hehe), it's too pompous this way, LaBrie sucks the other way, but I couldn't care less about it's pretentiousness. There's just something to it that I love, even LaBrie's voice, or Rudess' wanking-happy solos.\n\nYeah this is incredibly pompous, starting from \"Regression\", with that little spoken part of the hypnotherapist, but the vocal melody is just so damn catchy, and it also appears later in the album, much like Virgin Steele's \"The House of Atreus\", which gives it a sense of continuity, since this is a concept album after all! Every song here is awesome, except for \"Through My Words\", which is completely unnecessary, they could just put it on \"Fatal Tragedy\", but that's ok, since it's not a bad interlude, just a bit off-place. When \"Regression\" ends, it melds into \"Overture 1928\", which is one of my personal favorites; it's awesome how it complements the story, a part in which the main character is floating through a bunch of lights when being hypnotized, it sounds very atmospheric, you almost feel what he would have been feeling at the time. The keyboard melody at 0:44 is one of my favorites, and that one also repeats itself at some points, too! There are also plenty of solos by Petrucci/Rudess, and yes, they're wankery, but I believe they complement the songs pefectly, and Petrucci's slow solos are just pure genius, even though he's a tad overrated shredder.\n\nThe only weak track that I can find is \"Strange Deja Vu\", but it's just weak because it is right after \"Overture 1928\", which is fucking unfair! My problem with \"Strange...\" is that it's a little bit overlong, but the chorus repeats the afford mentioned awesome keyboard melody, and that's pretty cool. After 2:44 it sounds a bit out of place and starts plodding, but then it repeats the fucking melody again and that leaves me happy! \"Fatal Tragedy\" sounds pretty fucking epic at times, like the bridge before the chorus, there's a very cool and sort of hidden vocal melody behind, which makes it sound really cool. Then there's an almost thrashy riff at 3:50, which is followed by a bunch of keyboard/guitar trade-off solos. It suddenly stops, and we have yet another really heavy (You gotta love how this album is both beautiful, epic, AND heavy!), \"Beyond This Life\" has a fucking speed metal riff, and the soloing in the middle is very weird, but it sounds cool, shredding ahoy to kingdom come. The last guitar solo of Petrucci, which ends up with that chorus at 10:05 is great, it sounds HUGE, I don't know how to explain it, maybe it's LaBrie's voice, he makes me want to sing along, even if he fucking sucks when doing it himself--I can't help it. Other thing I like is the snare drum's sound, it sounds very powerful, you can feel every goddamn beat like a bat to your head, and it works both when it wants to be soft, or fucking loud, but you'd already know Portnoy is a very good drummer, it's Dream Theater after all!\n\nAnother sort of sub-par track is \"Through Her Eyes\", but it's not bad, the only problem is that when you have heard this album over 100 times (like me!), you're already wanting it to finish so \"Home\" can start, and still, \"Through Her Eyes\" it's a good ballad, but it doesn't have shit over the best ballad here--More on that later! \"Through Her Eyes\" is the only song that doesn't morph into another one, keeping the continuity, it may be a sort of tribute to Pink Floyd doing it on \"The Wall\" when they had to change album sides. Ok, when that thing ends, there's \"Home\". Ahh, ok, \"Home\" is...Fucking awesome. It could very well be the best goddamn song in here, and since Petrucci tuned down to Dropped D, it sounds really heavy. The intro has that brooding sitar solo, and when it gets really intense, we have that wahwah filled riff, which makes your head bang like there's no tomorrow. It has a very 'oriental' sound, like that bridge at 2:06, sounds very arabic, at least for me! It's main riff is pretty heavy, though I don't like it's \"stop and go\" nature, but then LaBrie's voice comes and it's almost anthemic.\n\nThe pre-chorus is really intense, and even though it has some nasty off-key singing moments, you forget them with Petrucci's solo before the chorus, and if you don't like that goddamn chorus, you have no soul. \"Help, I'm falling\", damnit, I even like the lyrics, something that I don't usually care for much, but this thing made me read them and get into the story, and even though it is VEEERYY pompous and pretentious, it has a certain charm to it. But a good story must have good music to back it up, and they are able to do that perfectly. Maybe the reason why I like this so much, is because I liked the story, the lyrics, and the music, altogether. \"Home\" has some more shredtastical\u2122 soloing, though I don't know how the 2 minutes of sex noises at the mid do anything, maybe they were thinking \"does this make you horny?\", well it doesn't. After the last chorus there's a little bridge with a very oriental feeling, with the drum percussions, and it's pretty damn catchy.\n\nOn to the probably most criticized song in here, that's gotta be \"The Dance of Eternity\". It has like 100 rhythm and tempo changes, and a lot of gratuitous soloing, there's some much silly stuff that you can't even headbang or anything to it, since it's hard to keep on with the timing, so I recommend you listen to it the way you'd listen to jazz or classical music. It sometimes loses focus, but it has really cool parts everywhere, though they could be united in a better way; some parts are really catchy, like that one at 2:16, which you KNOW sounds like something you have heard before, but you can't make it out--Until the fucking keyboard solo comes and tells you that it actually sounded like old 20's music. That thing at 2:32 very well might be Rudess' best keyboard solo ever, it's really catchy, it's fun, and you weren't expecting it, then there's more shredding everywhere, and even a fucking bass solo courtesy of the chinky but very talented John Myung. Talking about that, his bass performance is flawless in this album, but again, you already knew that, cause it's fucking Dream Theater.\n\nThen there are the ballads. Right after \"The Dance of Eternity\", there's \"One Last Time\", which starts with a very beautiful piano intro; proving Rudess doesn't only wank all the time! But I have always thought LaBrie sounds like a woman in it, maybe if he sung rougher or something, but after Petrucci's solo, there we have it again at 2:18; I fucking love that melody, it's one of my favorite things about this album--Yeah, I'm judging a whole album based on a keyboard melody. \"One Last Time\" starts fading away, and then we have \"The Spirit Carries On\", which I have to agree with the other reviewers in that it's total Pink Floyd worship, but again so was the whole Progressive/Concept Album thing, and the song is good in itself anyways. The vocal melody is incredibly catchy, and sounds a lot like \"Regression\", though it's not so noticeable until the reprise after the solo. The guitar solo is one of Petrucci's best, and that, too, is total Pink Floyd worship, with a shreddier form. It's weird how this album is so goddamn awesome, yet the rest of Dream Theater sucks, I saw them live this year and they had the shameless dare of not playing a single song from Scenes from a Memory, fags! Ok, back to \"The Spirit Carries On\", even though the solo is really awesome, the best part is the reprise of \"Regression\" at 4:23, which (again) is Pink Floyd worship, like the reprise of \"Breath\" in \"Time\", back from The Dark Side of the Moon. \n\n\"The Spirit Carries On\" ends with some wails from a guest gospel singer which her name I can't recall, but it is pretty cool having it at the end, over the little piano melody. Scenes from a Memory ends with \"Finally Free\", which is the most pompous, pretentious, but awesome song I have heard this side of Manowar. It has a LOT of sound effects to tell the story, like when the main character gets in his car and leaves, and the synth melody at 1:04 is so brooding and evil, it's almost disturbing, but in a good way! I love how that piano sounds below the verses, then the chorus as a shitload of choruses behind, and from 4:00 they tell you the goddamn story with sounds, you hear how the guy enters the house and he struggles with the girl and shoots her lover, and then her, and then he says \"open your eyes\", over a really creepy melody--If that's not the most pretentious and pompous thing you have heard, well, I hope you die, you narcissistic bastard. However, Petrucci's solo is very beautiful, and I don't really care about how pompous it is, as long as the music is good. The only thing I don't like is how they repeat the same brooding, evil, but ultimately boring melody at the end, for almost 5 minutes! The there are more sound effects to tell the story, and the guy dies or something like that, then there's static noise that begins \"The Glass Prison\" from the next album, and since that song is fucking awesome, I guess it's alright!\n\nAll in all, Scenes from a Memory is a landmark in progressive metal; people complains on how pompous it is, and that it's overlong, and that it has no soul, and it rapes kittens and stuff, but I don't care (ok maybe if it did rape kittens). But it's the only album I like from Dream Theater, and not only like, but worship and love. You just need to forget about the pretentiousness, and be prepared for 80 minutes of musical awesomeness. It's by far their best; you must get it!\n",
        "\n6 tracks? Of course, ti doesn't sound intimidating to pick up. In fact, I almost turned down this album because of how short it was. It's only 45 minutes! However, what's in store is where it counts.\n\nEver hear the saying \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\"? Yeah, somebody told me that when I was questioning this album.\n\nOpening this live show you get blasted by the infamous sci-fi metal of Metropolis. Even the transition in to A Fortune In Lies is good. However, those aren't the gems, but they sure start it off, (especially since it's awesome to hear LaBrie sing this, instead of Dominici's \"career killing\" voice at the time) along with a beautiful Surrounded. However, take a listen to Bombay Vindaloo, and suddenly Dream Theater takes you on a roller coaster of sheer metallity. Starts off slow, I know, but keep in mind, this is a JAM here. Planned, but improvised. From Portnoy's rollin' beats in the back in the beginning to Petrucci's and Moore's sheer annihilation of their respective metal tools.\n\nThen you have to go through Another Hand / The Killing Hand. With LaBrie, this is about as metal as you can get from him. The only time where saying that LaBrie got his testes caught in a doorjam is actually a good thing in the fact that the result tears down the Marquee at the sheer awesomeness the entire band pulls out in this show.\n\nThen of course you have Pull Me Under at the end, always a great song to end, because you always have a crowd pleaser there.\n\nThat said, this live show is not perfect because of Surrounded. I like the song, they play it wonderfully here, but seeing as I vary a lot between metal and prog rock, mostly to the metal side................meh. Doesn't matter, the album is still awesome anyway.\n\nHighlights: Bombay Vindaloo, Another Hand / The Killing Hand, Pull Me Under\n",
        "\nOk, for a show that starts out with A Change Of Seasons, this ain't bad. The song itself is great for a 24 minute epic. The first disc is great, showcasing Puppies on Acid, Voices (with a quick SW force theme intro), Take The Time (with Free Bird / Moby Dick teasers at the end), along with Sherinian's solo and the massive Scarred -> The Darkest Of Winters -> YTSE Jam -> Mike's solo. \n\nBeing a drummer myself, any of Mike's solos are incredible. Sherinian's wasn't, though, too short, and too heavily influenced by Lines In The Sand, which, although a great song, took away from his originality, which is simply a 30 second jam of him playing a few quick notes.\n\nThe next disc gets a bit foggy. Trial Of Tears starts with an intro to some cool teasers, including Close Encounters With The Third Kind, and ends awesomely. Hollow Years is definitely a week spot there, including Take Away My Pain. What? Seriously! You had Burning My Soul and Hell's Kitchen, 2 awesome songs from FII, my personal favorites, and you played Hollow Years and Take Away My Pain? For shame.\n\nCaught In A Web is played excellently in this show, although Lie wasn't. LaBrie's voice faltered at times where I couldn't hear what he was saying. One song that he doesn't sing high on for the verses, and I STILL CAN'T HEAR HIM!\n\nPeruvian Skies is a personal favorite, with the Have A Cigar and Enter Sandman teasers in there, it's way better than the studio version. I personally am a big favorite of solos, and John's is great, however, at times his soloing was, need I say it, \"too crazy\" where you can't hear the notes being played. If you can't hear the notes in a solo, what's the point of playing it? That said, the whole transition ending at Pull Me Under is fantastic, great way to close out a show.\n\nMetropolis starts the encore, although after 2:30 they start to solo right into Learning To Live. That whole transition, and in fact, the whole 10 miutes of both of those songs were another week point. The songs could've been longer, but they weren't, Metropolis at 6:16, LTL at 4:13. Heck, I couldn't even tell I was listening to LTL at a certain point!\n\nEnding the encore with The Crimson Sunset, the show isn't that bad overall, but could've been a lot better. Burning My Soul and Hell's Kitchen, as I said before would be much better and make the show so much better, since they would make such epic endings.\n\nThis show, however, is a great way to avoid getting Falling Into Infinity, since most of the good songs are already on here, and Burning My Soul and Hell's Kitchen are only better live. Overall, great album, but not perfect. Barely every live show is ever perfect.\n",
        "\n\u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d is a problematic album. The first warning sign is the album\u2019s length: 20 minutes longer than any typical Dream Theater release. Yes, this is progressive metal, but long songs aren\u2019t always what progressive music is about: it\u2019s about creating something that is beyond what you hear on the radio, by testing out your limits. It\u2019s about exploring your own creativity as a musician, trying to break boundaries and doing something different, using weird time signatures, peculiar instruments, and ambient sounds or even writing lengthy songs. I\u2019m pretty sure this isn\u2019t the formal definition of progressive but this is the way I see it. \n\nSo, is a 13-minute song necessarily progressive? Well, if it\u2019s just overstretched and drags on without any purpose then no. If it\u2019s a smooth composition that leaves no room for filler parts than I guess you can call it progressive. But the real question is still unanswered: is a 42-minute song necessarily progressive? That depends. If you\u2019re an avid Dream Theater fan that only by looking on the track listing you get excited from the length of the title track while moments from \u201cA Change of Seasons\u201d play in your head, you might consider this song progressive. You cannot wait to get back home and listen to this album because if this song is so long it must be so awesome and epic. That\u2019s just the problem. Dream Theater managed to trick their fans with this song into thinking they\u2019ve created such an epic masterpiece. In this case however, this track is REALLY just a series of unrelated songs that don\u2019t fit well, but rather just stuck together.\n\nAfter 1999\u2019s \u201cScenes From A Memory\u201d, I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of Dream Theater fans were waiting for another astonishing masterpiece. Sure, \u201cScenes\u201d was great, and by far better than the previous effort \u201cFalling Into Infinity\u201d, but somehow I cannot help but think that the fans that worship this band so much have ridiculous expectations. What\u2019s even more ridiculous is that Dream Theater are adding more oil to the fire by trying to fulfill those wild expectations and make each release more pretentious than the other.\n\nI should mention that I\u2019m a big Dream Theater fan and that I\u2019ve always loved their wide range of material and how they alter their sound with each album. I appreciate this because that way they manage not to repeat themselves too much. With this album, Dream Theater finally cemented themselves as a progressive metal act rather than a progressive rock act, at least with the first disc of this double album. \n\nThe first disc is compromised of heavy experimental material. While it\u2019s a bit inconsistent, it still features \u201cThe Glass Prison\u201d, one of the best song Dream Theater have ever made, as well as \u201cMisunderstood\u201d and \u201cThe Great Debate\u201d, two other great songs. Featuring a more technical approach and more 7-string action, by itself, this disc isn\u2019t nearly as long as a typical Dream Theater release. In my opinion, a lengthy (yet still in the 15 minute range) closing epic sixth track could have made this album excellent (as long as it was good of course), but Dream Theater took it to the next level, and wrote a 42-minute song. \n\nDisappointed after their label didn\u2019t authorize the release of a double album back in 1997, Mike Portnoy and his palls finally had a chance to release such an album in 2002, only now it seems that this was done just for the sake of releasing a double album.\nThe second disc consists only of the title track which lasts 42:04. The song is divided into 8 tracks that represent the 8 movements of the song. \n\nBeginning with the instrumental \u201cOverture\u201d, the song already gets boring halfway through this first movement which goes nowhere. After this section you will stumble across some decent tracks with horrible lyrics \u2013 \u201cAbout To Crash\u201d & \u201cAbout To Crash (Reprise)\u201d, some genuinely just boring and highly forgettable tracks \u2013 \u201cSolitary Shell\u201d & \u201cGoodnight Kiss\u201d and the closing movement \u201cLosing Time / Grand Finale\u201d that just doesn\u2019t deliver the goods. The two remaining movements, \u201cWar Inside My Head\u201d & \u201cThe Test That Stumped Them All\u201d are surprisingly awesome, featuring great technical work and a great vocal performance by Labrie. These tracks however, are hardly redeeming. Overall, the songs just don\u2019t fit together and you end with a big mess that\u2019s supposed to be a big epic song. \n\n\u201cThe Test That Stumped Them All\u201d could have easily been placed on the first disc if it had it been longer because it doesn\u2019t fit at all in the second disc. Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be one song? Because all I heard was just 8 songs that are barely consistent but are linked lyrically. \n\nAll I make of this second disk is that the band got too pretentious for its own good. Although the first disc is great, and the band managed to venture into new grounds, showcasing a heavier darker style, its length is barely more than half of the entire double album, and the second disc makes it a pretty lame attempt as a whole.\n",
        "\nOctavarium could have been Dream Theater's best album since 1999's \u201cScenes From A Memory\u201d and a great achievement. At first I deemed it their weakest effort, but after subsequent repeated listening I discovered Octavarium is better than I thought. Actually, what makes Octavarium worth listening to is the title track. This 24-minute epic which I first thought was pretentious and forgettable is arguably one of Dream Theater's best songs in the 2000s and arguably in their entire 20-year career. \n\nApart from that 24 minute experience, this album has more things to offer for the avid Dream Theater fan, such as a complex concept (the album deals with circles, the numbers 8 and 5 and other stuff but I won\u2019t bother to elaborate because this topic has been covered before) and the melodic approach we all came to know and love that was lost somewhere while the band was making Train of Thought. \n\nMaybe because of some backslash after the heavy Train of Thought, the band made it clear that they were going back to their melodic roots. This album sounds much more like their 2002 release \u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d than the previous effort. Some of the songs on the album could have been easily placed next to songs like \u2018Blind Faith\u2019 or \u2018The Great Debate\u2019 from SDoIT. \n\nOctavarium has a notable advantage compared to Train of Thought. Jordan Rudess is much more prominent and contributive in this album. His keyboards were buried low in the mix in Train of Thought but here they make a heroic return. The use of an orchestra in song such as \u201cOctavarium\u201d and \u201cSacrificed Sons\u201d adds a lot to the epic melodic journey that is Octavarium.\n\nApart from Jordan Rudess that made his comeback in this album, James Labrie delivers one of his best vocal performances in years. His voice sounds stronger than ever. Labrie himself stated that he thought that only by this album his vocal chords have healed after his operation ten years prior. The rapping and distorted vocals that were featured on Train of Thought are gone. \n\nAlso, while not being much of an advantage but perhaps a change in thinking to suit the concept, the album is constructed in a way that all songs flow into one another. In comparison, Train of Thought was more about separate individual \u201ckicking ass on their own\u201d tracks.\n\nWhat eventually makes this album inferior is the outer influence that is reflected pretty obviously in the band\u2019s work, creating filler tracks that ruin the continuity between the strong tracks. \u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d which is the second track on the album ruins much of the momentum that was created by the opening promising opener and is basically just a mellow forgettable song.\n\nThe fourth notorious track \u201cI Walk Beside You\u201d is more U2 than Dream Theater. Mike Portnoy stated the band wanted to do this kind of song for a long time but the cost is justified criticism by the old fans. \u201cNever Enough\u201d, which has been compared to Muse's \u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d really shows the obvious influence the \u201cinspiration corner\u201d has on the band\u2019s work. It seems the band has been using other music to get inspiration for a while, letting some elements penetrate into their sessions. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, Dream Theater sometimes uses too much of what gave them inspiration. It\u2019s disappointing that we can't get one record which is 100% Dream Theater. \u201cNever Enough\u201d still isn\u2019t half bad but it\u2019s not nearly as exciting as \u201cPanic Attack\u201d, which is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs on the album.\n\nWith 'Sacrificed Sons' the album's seventh track, the band combines their more relaxed approach with their recent, heavier attitude. This track isn\u2019t one of my favorites, and not really much of a highlight in the album, making way for the final song to shine.\n\nOctavarium, the last song on the album is what Dream Theater fans have been waiting for since \u201cA Change of Seasons\u201d. The 42 minute \u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d which seemed to me like a real exaggeration was a second take on making a long epic song, but \u201cOctavarium\u201d is the real deal. Each section in the song is great, combining slow verses with haunting synth lines, making this song a perfect epic closer to the album. The 4-minute Rudess continuum solo in the beginning, the long instrumental section and Petrucci's beautiful solo that is backed up by an orchestra, among other parts and attributes make this song one of Dream Theater greatest achievements. One can presume that the band put more time and effort into this song than the rest of the album.\n\nAs I said in the beginning of this review, Octavarium could have been one of Dream Theater's greatest albums. Unfortunately, it is ruined by filler tracks and bad influences. While still managing to stay consistent at some level, the album is still far from perfect. Nevertheless, I still recommend this album to avid Dream Theater fans. For newcomers that might want to experience this great band for the first time with this album, I suggest you try either \u201cScenes From A Memory\u201d or \u201cImages and Words\u201d first.\n\n73%.\n",
        "\nI cannot believe what I am reading right now. Train of Thought is DT selling out to mallcore/nu metal? Has the metal scene really gone up it\u2019s ass with closed mindedness and apprehension that much. This is probably Dream Theater\u2019s heaviest album yet. It has their best written songs of their career, their most technical musicianship and the heaviest of their sound combined. In my opinion that makes for their best album of their career. I will go into more detail on why this is not a sellout later, but let me start with the goods.\n\nAn album is nothing without songwriting, and honestly these are Dream Theaters best written songs of their whole career. Dream Theater is a band that is frequently knocked for being \u201call about technicality\u201d and various other criticisms along the same lines, and most of the time I am quick to come to their defense. Dream Theater, despite having extended instrumental sections, rarely go completely up their ass with the \u201cwe\u2019re so technical\u201d thing, and this is especially true on Train of Thought. Obviously the 10 minute plus songs all have these sections, but they actually fit the flow of the song very well and are not just random \u201cwanking\u201d, as many Dream Theater detractors dub it (which isn\u2019t even the technical definition of \u201cwanking\u201d in musical terms). The main riffs in the verses and choruses here are all very well done, whoever said that \u201con this album there are no actual riffs they just play power chords\u201d are obviously not listening hard enough. These are some of Dream Theater\u2019s most technical riffs of their career, but masked well under melodic song craft. Listen for example to the verse riff of \u201cAs I Am\u201d. Upon first inspection it may be overrun by James LaBrie\u2019s relatively simpler, driving vocal line, but when you inspect it, it actually contains some very quickly played 16th notes and triplets, balanced out with chords, plus a shifting time signature. When the band does do a simple riff, however (like the \u201cbreakdown\u201d section of \u201cHonor Thy Father\u201d), it completely proves wrong all of their detractors who say they have no sense of songwriting, because they place in simpler but more crushing and brutal riffs simply for the purpose that it better fits the emotion of the lyrics. DT knows where to be real and underplay some of their technicality when they have to, and anyone who claims to the contrary has obviously never really listened to Dream Theater.\n\nThe bands musicianship is also truly at their best, more varied and more melodic than anywhere else in their career while also being even more technical. John Petrucci\u2019s solos actually get even more technical (he starts to use techniques like sweep picking, which he had not done much of in the past, a lot more) and ridiculously fast (\u201cIn The Name of God\u201d) than before, but he always makes sure his solos have a melodic part that fits the song. Mike Portnoy\u2019s drumming has never been better. The heavy music allows for him to really show off his double bass skills, and this combined with his known skill with odd times and crazy fills, proves to all of the haters that Portnoy could hold his own against any death/black metal drummer (the intro to \u201cHonor Thy Father\u201d reminds me more than anything of something Richard Christy would do in Death, Slipknot influences my ass). Jordan Ruddess starts to really explore his more creative side here, playing a lot of really disjointed and odd stuff, while remaining totally technical and it works well. John Myung is buried by everything else as usual, but when he does pop up (like in the bridge to \u201cHonor Thy Father\u201d) he plays very well and does more than mirror Petrucci\u2019s guitar. James LaBrie continues to be the bands weak link, and really his somewhat half assed attempts at \u201caggressive\u201d vocals are the main reason I take two points off this album. However there are moments where his vocals really shine more than ever previously (\u201cEndless Sacrifice\u201d) and he shows his true potential. When this full potential is realized, LaBrie transcends to become an unstoppable force as much as his band mates.\n\nOnto the accusations of Train of Thought of being \u201cnu metal\u201d and a \u201csellout\u201d and whatnot, I hate nu metal as much as the next guy. If Dream Theater had truly gone nu metal (which would truly apply if Petrucci\u2019s had stopped playing solos, Ruddess began turntable scratching, the songs never deviated from 4/4 time and LaBrie utilized \u201cwigger\u201d style rap vocals at all times), then I would immediately decry them and call them a sellout. Seeing as the \u201csimple riffs\u201d part has already been disproved, I will go on to the accusations revolved around LaBrie\u2019s occasional (truly it shows up very rarely) utilization of \u201crap\u201d vocals. These rap vocals are not Fred Durst styled \u201cyo fuck dat shit muthafuka up da hood g unit!\u201d whatever. In fact, in the first of two rap vocal section, which occurs in \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d LaBrie simply speaks fast paced and actually quite aggressively, over a heavy and tense riff. This is yet another example of Dream Theater utilizing a technique simply because it works well with a song craft. If LaBrie had sung this part, it would have come out awful. That vocal style works better with that kind of tension. The other rap vocal section occurs in the first verse of \u201cHonor Thy Father\u201d, and if anything this is slightly more stylized, but once again, it is played over a simple, tense riff that would not work well with LaBrie\u2019s regular vocal style. And even with this taken aside, Dream Theater is a \u201cprogressive\u201d metal band, and what is \u201cprogressive\u201d truly but the idea that a band can incorporate sounds and influences from many genres. Perhaps in today\u2019s generation of Symphony X clones this virtue has been neglected, but regardless this technique is utilized twice throughout this very long album and it should not be made into nearly as big of a problem as it is. \n\nIn short, this album is absolutely incredible. Pay no attention to the detractors. This is the strongest work of Dream Theaters career, and while they have continued to make quality music, I doubt they will ever be able to outdo their magnum opus. This is recommended to all fans of progressive metal or even just any metal fan who wants to explore the more adventurous side of the music. Every single song is great, but in my opinion the strongest is \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d. If you don\u2019t already own this, do yourself a favor and purchase it at once.\n\nFinal score: 98% (minus one for LaBrie\u2019s more aggressive points being somewhat unconvincing and another for Vacant being a bit of a filler)\n",
        "\nI've read so many reviews about this album, plenty saying \"this is Dream Theater's big breakthrough in defining their talents!\", with plenty of others saying \"this album would be great, if LaBrie wasn't such a spaz and the musicianship would work better instead of with him.\"\n\nAnd at this point, I agree with both statements.\n\nBefore I begin, I have to say that the talent of Dream Theater is beyond incredibly awesome, which make instrumental songs (especially at live performances) the best songs you can ever listen to by Dream Theater. Why?\n\nWell, let's put it this way. LaBrie sucks.\n\nOk, call me a spaz, as long as I can call him one too. Seriously, if there was a \"Lifetime Spaz Award\", he'd take it away from Jackson, Ozzy, and me in a heartbeat. LaBrie isn't entirely bad, just that their take on a 1928 murder of a young woman and how a modern man is haunted by this crime just makes me scratch my head and go Tim Taylor. \n\nHuhhhhhhhhhh?\n\nRegression starts off the album in a pathetic attempt to set the mood via classic progressiveness by the clock and a peaceful acoustic guitar ballad transitioning into Overture 1928, which is one of my personal favorites, because every instrumental by Dream Theater instantly is given a plus by me, even though they aren't perfect half the time, such as The Dance Of Eternity.\n\nRudess' debut album here shows his kickass talent, but I think he just got a bit too excited over the fact that he was going to play with masters of prog metal and spaz soloed a bit too much. Not that Rudess' solos are bad, it's just, well, too much can make a brain bleed, and top a fucking migrane to Petrucci's solos and you'll never wanna see the word \"dream\" again, because you know you ain't gonna get one with DT's awesomeness stuck in your head.\n\nAlthough you might as well save up for their better albums, because this certainly ain't one of them.\n\nThe ballad of Strange Deja Vu / Through My Words/ Fatal Tragedy isn't particularly one of them, although Strange Deja Vu is ok, at least the beginning since it litteraly starts where Overture left off.\n\nThe weak points have to go to the ballads (Beyond This Life / Through Her Eyes, One Last Time, The Spirit Carries On, Finally Free). LaBrie exaggerates WAY too much. I can see why Arjen invited LaBrie to be a guest vocalist for Ayreon's The Human Equation. LaBrie tried to create a storyline effect here, but it didn't work to begin with, and he tried WAY too much to keep it together before it all fell apart. The Spirit Carries On isn't totally bad. At least it's one song that isn't clogged up too much by LaBrie's incessive storyline.\n\nFinally Free has to be the worst song ever made by Dream Theater, I have to get that off my chest right now. From beginning to end, from \"You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light\", to the glass shattering, gun pounding murder scene, to the very end where Nicolas goes home and is haunted for life, where the song ends where, ironically, The Glass Prison from the next album begins.\n\nAll in all, this album is decent. Some really good tracks, some really shitty tracks, but overall, LaBrie picked a bad time to try to take the spotlight this time, because it's always going to go to Petrucci, Rudess, and the rest of the band.\n\nHighlights: Overture 1928, Beyond This Life, Home, The Dance Of Eternity\n",
        "\n\u201cPull Me Under\u201d was one of the singles off Dream Theater\u2019s record breaking and chart topping album \u201cImages And Words\u201d. A music video was made for this track and shortly after it\u2019s release it soon became DT\u2019s most demanded track on the radio.\n\nClocking in at slightly more than 8 minutes this is one of DT\u2019s best offerings to the progressive world and is keyboardist Kevin Moore\u2019s creation. Starting off with a slow intro with the drums in the background the keyboards and guitar\u2019s soon come in this slow melancholic smooth tune. Petrucci follows this with a guitar riff and the tempo starts to increase gradually. The soulful voice of James LaBrie soon enters near the 2 min mark and only adds to the overall atmosphere of the track. This track is extremely technical and this level of technicality is the reason DT is a peg above the other progressive bands in the business. \n\nNear the 5:30 mark there is this break down and only the keyboards and drums play. Petrucci delivering one of the smoothest and most technical solos in the music industry till date follows this. The surprising thing about the track is the unconventional ending. The song just stops playing (Hinting probably on the sudden occurrences in life, probably death).\n\nThe production of this is as good as it gets. So technical and so soulful, yet every note comes out perfectly on tape with every instrument right from the keyboards to the bass being easily audible. In my opinion DT never made an album that so was perfect in production until after many years. Hear this track and you will almost instantaneously realize why DT are called the \u201cThe Gods Of Progressive Metal\u201d and why this track gained the most popularity.\n",
        "\nDream Theater was never a band that I liked that much. I only had When Dream and Day Unite and some of the most well known songs out of their other records, but they just didn't sound appealing to me. However, some time ago I discovered the progressive rock/metal realms, so I thought to myself that I should check the other Dream Theater records out. I mean, Dream Theater was one of the first bands to play true progressive metal (along with Fates Warning and Watchtower) and, nowadays, they are considered the epitome of the whole genre, as few bands have a so wide and big fanbase as DT. Anyways, two or three months ago, my girlfriend offered me the Metropolis 2000 DVD (which contains this whole album played live) and I instantly became a huge fan of the band. Obviously, the first step I made, after receiving the DVD, was buy the record, in order to really appreciate the MUSIC on it.\n\nIt's funny to see the mixed reactions that all the Dream Theater records cause on the fans. There are people out other that say that Train of Thought is the worst album of the band, but you can easily find lots of other people who say that it is their best. Of course that, with bands with large catalogs, it is easy to find different opinions between the fans, but, hey, with DT this is taken to the extreme. As we're talking about this record, you can search for it on ProgArchives and see the large amount of reviewers there saying that Metropolis is a masterpiece and songs like Beyond this Life are amazing; see the reviews here, on Encyclopedia Metallum, and you'll find the majority of the reviewers saying that the album is just GOOD and that songs like Beyond this Life are killed by the long solo sections.\n\nIndeed, the solo sections are considered to be the biggest problem of the record. Dream Theater are constantly accused to write songs just to show their technical playing, etc, etc. However, I fully understand why the band insisted so much on the solos here: mainly thanks to two different things. \n\nFirst: Jordan Rudess. The sucessor of Derek is, indeed, an authentic dream of a musician, able to play almost everything he wants to. And so, imagine: you get into a progressive metal band, to fill in as a keyboardist and you know that the former keyboardists of the band were authentic virtuosos. What do you do? You write long solos, in order to show everyone how good you are and why you deserve to be with the band. Simple, isn't it? And who am I to criticize a musician that just wants to prove his talent?\n\nSecond: Falling Into Infinity. Yeah, the infamous lost record of the band, constantly called the worst one the band ever wrote, \u201ctoo pop-ish and soft\u201d, they say. Well, I haven't listened to that record yet, but, after it, Dream Theater asked their label to let them do whatever they want (as the sound of the album is often related to the label's wishes to turn the band into pop music). So, what do you make when you are constantly accused to be a sell-out by your fanbase? You show them that you are loyal to your roots. What are the roots of Dream Theater? Progressive music, music played by talented, gifted musicians. So you compose lengthy solo sections, to show everyone how prog you are. Understandable, no?\n\nAnd, wow, Metropolis is a concept album, another thing very common within the progressive circles. It deals with reincarnation and death, basically a guy begins to dream about a woman and visits a hypnotherapist. The hypnotherapist takes him to the past and he realizes that he IS the woman. Or, at least, he WAS the woman in one of his past lives. Anyways, I won't spoil the storyline further, so, if you don't understand the concept, it's better if you search on Wikipedia about it (the article about this record there is pretty good) or, if you can, get the before-mentioned DVD, which explains the concept very well too.\nSo, lyrically, the songs don't stand very well individually, it's always better to listen to the album as a whole.\n\nNow, let's get to the songs. As I've already said, technical proficiency is what you can expect from the band: John Petrucci is everywhere, even playing some thrashy riffs and leads here and there, Mike Portnoy is the drum monster we all know (and love) and Myung is, during the most part of the record, inaudible (I hate when TALENTED bassists are treated this way). LaBrie no longer sounds like the maniac that made Awake what it is (after all he got his vocal chords broken, for God's sake!), but, in the end, he delivers a pretty solid performance. Sometimes, he sounds like a girl, in order to represent Victoria (the woman that appears in the dreams of the protagonist); that's not the greatest thing in the world, using your vocalist to emulate some woman singing, but it works decently well, after all.\n\nAbout the songwriting - many songs contain, like I've already said, intricate solo sections, but there is a lot of variety. One instrumental, some epics, some headbangable songs, ballads... very diverse, indeed. Every song adds something to the storyline, which, despite not being the most interesting and cleverest thing ever done on the face of Earth, is pretty consistent and tasteful. However, after I discovered the whole story, I stopped listening to the record: the durability is not the strong point of this piece, in my opinion.\n\nThe album is divided in two acts (being the second act a bit more solid than the first, in my opinion) and the acts are divided into scenes (from a memory). \nSo, Metropolis kicks off with a small intro with the hypnotherapist calming Nicholas, the protagonist, down and, err, taking him back to the past. The lyrics of the tune are very, very good, they fit the music well and kind of grab the listener, powerfully, inside the atmosphere of the album.\n\n\u201cClose your eyes and begin to relax. \nTake a deep breath, and let it out slowly. \nConcentrate on your breathing. \nWith each breath you become more relaxed. \nImagine a brilliant white light above you, \nfocusing on this light as it flows through your body. \nAllow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and \ndeeper into a more relaxed state of mind. \nNow as I count back from ten to one, \nyou will feel more peaceful, and calm. \nTen. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. \nYou will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. \nFive. Four. Three. Two. \nIf at any time you need to come back, \nall you must do is open your eyes. One.\u201d\n\nAtmospheric, isn't it? Especially if you are listening to the song at night, before you sleep.\n\nAnyways, the second track, Overture 1928, is an authentic winner. It sums up the whole record, as it contains some parts of the other songs and even parts of Metropolis Pt.1, out of the Images and Words record. One highlight, indeed.\nAnother one is track three, Strange Dej\u00e1 Vu, which follows the same structure as the fifth one, Fatal Tragedy: a nice first section, with a catchy chorus, and then a heavy part where Petrucci plays some truly headbangable and catchy riffs.\n\nBeyond this Life is like a beta version of The Glass Prison, and is probably the heaviest song of the record. It's one of the longer songs, together with Finally Free and Home. \nHome has a very exotic beginning that ends with the beginning of a very catchy guitar riff. It has a middle section filled with some nice solos and some erotic (!!!) screams. Finally Free closes the record, beginning with a very SOMBER keyboard line (Jordan is a God just because of that line, I really love it). It is probably the most obscure song of the record, it kind of involves you in a dark, almost scary atmosphere and it doesn't let you out until the end. And WHAT AN END to the whole concept, the first time I saw (and heard it) on the DVD, it really scared me (I'm just a little boy, you know).\n\nDance of Eternity also deserves a special mention, being constantly labeled as a song made to show the skills of the Theater musicians. In my opinion, it is no Erotomania or YYZ, but it's a nice track and not boring at all.\nAnyways, there is a tune on the record that I really don't get why so many people like: The Spirit Carries On. Sure it has a gospel choir (a la Pink Floyd) singing together with James LaBrie, but, hey, the lyrics are too cheesy and the song has a strange happy vibe that I don't like. Meh.\n\nSo, this record surely is flawed, I mean, the regular metalhead will not love this stuff, it is too \u201cproggy\u201d for his tastes, but, hey, if you are a fan of progressive metal, this album will be an excellent addiction to your collection.\nThe total length of Metropolis can also be a problem: the album clocks in at 70, 75 minutes, if I'm not wrong, so you will need time to understand and discover all the things this piece has to offer. Nevertheless, the album is solid and not the big piece of pompous crap that many reviewers stated it is.\n\nBest moments of the CD:\n-Regression.\n-the transition between Fatal Tragedy and Beyond this Life.\n-the main riff of Home.\n-the chorus of One Last Time.\n-the drum lines of the middle section of Finally Free.\n-the last minute of the album.\n",
        "\nFrankly, I am a casual Dream Theater fan at best. I certainly appreciate their technical virtuosity, and realize that they are the essential prog metal band, but I find that too often their releases degenerate into a technically perfect but spiritually soulless record.\n\nNot so for Images & Words. This album, being their second studio release (and first with singer James Labrie), is to me, the pinnacle of Dream Theater's achievements. Though many would argue that further releases, especially Awake, would improve upon their patented heavy/progressive metal sound, I prefer Images & Words for a number of reasons.\n\nFirstly, the album contains some of the strongest songs Dream Theater has ever produced. With the exception of \"Another Day\", every song is well executed, and more importantly, engaging and interesting (something that cannot be said about some of their latter works). Great slabs of metal like \"Pull Me Under\" (Dream Theater's only significant radio/video hit), \"Under a Glass Moon\" (containing arguably John Petrucci's best solo), and \"Metropolis\" (my personal favourite Dream Theater song) are offset perfectly by the less agressive songs, particularly the beautiful and melodious \"Waiting for Sleep\", one of Kevin Moore's best contributions in his short tenure with the band.\n\nSecondly, the album contains great performances by all the members. John Petrucci lays down chugging riffs and amazing solos, Mike Portnoy is furious with his fills and beats, John Myung is as consistent and awe-inspiring as ever, and Kevin Moore provides some truly memorable performances, specifically the piano-drive \"Waiting for Sleep\". And, with his first studio album with the band, James Labrie delivers a standout vocal performance, one that, ever since the rupturing of his vocal chords, he has not been able to reproduce.\n\nLastly, the production, as is with every Dream Theater album, spotless. Whereas some bands seem to have problem with continually producing albums with great sound, Dream Theater has no such problem.\n\nIn conclusion, regardless of your affinity to prog metal, this is an essential album to have. If you buy one Dream Theater album, make it this one.\n",
        "\nDream Theater is a veritable musical chameleon, able to take on countless styles, themes and atmospheres. Lining up their catalogue feels completely natural, rather than forced and stilted - it's in this way that they are truly a \"progressive\" band that never binds itself to any single style and keeps challenging itself, setting aside the often-exaggerated accusations of pointless wankery leveled at some of their music.\n\nIt's in this spirit that we have Dream Theater's full live cover of Master Of Puppets by thrash metal's most well-known [Gods or clods, depending on who you talk to]. To sum this release up in four words, coming from who is, by his own admission, a die-hard Dream Theater fan: you don't need it.\n\nUnlike the Number Of The Beast cover album where there were neat little touches here and there, this is pretty much a carbon copy of the original for the most part, with less punchy production and some tasteful use of Rudess's keyboard to fill in the gaps left by reducing Hetfield and Hammet's lead/rythm team to a single guitar. Petrucci's playing is immaculate for the most part, albeit lacking much of the punch of the original thanks to the 'official bootleg' style of production. Myung is about as audible as Cliff was on the original recording (Read: not very). Portnoy is solid as ever, no complaints there. The instrumental section of the band is what makes this release a treat to own for me.\n\nAh, James LaBrie. I'm one of the few who quite likes his vocal performance, but many DT fans know to approach the Six Degrees/Train Of Thought touring era recordings with a bit of caution - his voice was at a low point there before it swung back up to its old splendor with the Octavarium/Systematic Chaos tours. This recording, however, shows him at his worst - comparable to Once In A Livetime. I can't tell if he has a cold, if he's just tired (This is the second set in a second show of a two-night stand in Barcelona) or if he's trying to do a \"tuff dood\" thrash voice - but whatever it is, it didn't work. Battery lacks the convincing bite that Hetfield added to his lines, and Leper Messiah sounds less than powerful - but the title track is sung well, and James does seem to get a second wind on Damage Inc. for a nice finish to the cover set. He unfortunately drags the score down a few notches; if his vocals had been Score-quality, I can see myself giving this release a 70, even an 80.\n\nWell, what you see is what you get: it's 2002-era Dream Theater performing Master Of Puppets in its entirety. Sound good to you? Seek it out, because DT's instrumental take on the album is worth a listen for the intrepid DT fan. Doesn't interest you? Don't bother, because the actual album is pretty much just that.\n",
        "\nYes this album doesn't have LaBrie. Yes this album is the one with the homoerotic cover (seriously DT, what's with the cover?). And yes, this album doesn't sound like their next efforts.\n\nDream Theater's debut is underwhelming to the fans of the later works, although some people, i.e. me, don't think it's a blasphemy to the DT name. Yes the production is rough and the songs don't last for 13 minutes with 11 minute shred/wankfests. But it adds to the charm of the album.\n\nFirst the production, in one word: Ick. The guitar tone is horrible when it's not soloing, the drums have that 80s drum sound that sounds way too poppy at times, the bass...well at least you can hear John Myung unlike later albums (Metropolis Pt.2 and on) where Myung is only there for the bass solos. About the only thing that sounds the same as Images and Words are the keyboards. Man I miss Kevin Moore, he knows that keyboards are supposed to add ATMOSPHERE. Keyword there, ATMOSPHERE! Yes he can do keyboard leads, but that is secondary to their true purpose, adding atmosphere.\n\nThe songs are very good although they don't sound like Dream Theater. DT decided to put the metal in prog metal. Thus the riffs in this record is more metal than all of their latter records combined (except the The Glass Prison and all of Awake). Just listen to \"A Fortune in Lies\", that is a thrash riff right there. The solos in the songs are definitely shredtastic(tm). Simply put, John Petrucci is a GOD on guitar! This album is different in that his solos are not just there for solos, they actually add to the song.\n\nThen comes the singing, I don't understand why fanboys think Charlie Dominici is a crime against humanity. His voice fits the songs perfectly and I prefer his version of \"A Fortune in Lies\" over LaBrie's (LaBrie has the tendency to scream \"YEAAAH!\" at the end of a verse). The only song that is way off the Dream Theater course is \"Status Seeker\" I don't know why but it's too poppy and it's just not metal sounding. Obviously \"The Ytse Jam\" is a highlight and is definitely one of Dream Theater's best instrumentals, although I have a hard time differentiating the bass solo from a guitar riff because they have the same tone.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad album. It's actually greater than some of their latter efforts. Sure there ain't no LaBrie, but that doesn't mean it's bad. The people who think he sucks are the same people who think Paul Di'Anno, John Greely etc. suck balls.\n\nToo bad there's no re-release or anything with bonuses (unless you count When Dream and Day Reunite). This album deserves it.\n",
        "\nI don't like Dream Theater that much, but I don't get most people's complaints about them, either. It's self-indulgent wankery? They need to learn to write songs? Come on now. That's like watching a kung-fu movie and complaining that they need to stop interrupting the plot with all those self-indulgent fight scenes. You're supposed to be enjoying their flashiness and visceral thrill! Try not to be so ungrateful.\n\nStill, they are still, for me, pretty much the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pull Me Under\u00e2\u20ac\u009d band. If memory serves, that wasn't the first choice of a single from Images and Words, which if true must be one of the most astonishing facts in the history of music. The rest of the album isn't nearly as memorable, or as metal, and that would go for the other occasional bits of their music that I've heard. And then there's the matter of James LaBrie's shrill vocals; no, I am not a fan. \n\nThis album is kind of a flagship album for the band, one that was hyped shamelessly on its release and seems to be remembered as a defining moment a decade later. It's potentially a more entertaining album for a non-fan than Dream Theater's usual output. The booklet for Images and Words depicted the band standing around some kind of magical Greek temple in the sky, looking pensive and thoughtful and important, and thankfully there isn't much of that here. \n\nMetropolis Pt 2 is comparatively more down-to-earth, and yet it's a bit theatrical. Fitting, given the concept \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the booklet, which looks like the script from a play. I might as well mention now that in spite of having listened to this album countless times over the course of years and even knowing a lot of the lyrics, I have almost no idea what the plot is. There's not much indication of which character is saying what thing in the music itself, so as a concept album it fails a bit at that end.\n\nIn calling I theatrical I don't mean that it's prone to explosive emotion or pretension. It's more like band, sensing a bored and impatient audience, seeks to entertain them by dragging out one strange and amusing thing after another. Some might find it a little cheesy to have one song that copies Tool and one that copies Pink Floyd, but for those of us who would otherwise perceive the album as a mush of airy prog noodling, it's a big help. The same goes for the saloon piano and any of their other goofy tricks.\n\nThe songs do run together. The first track change I hear is at the end of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fatal Tragedy,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and that's already the transition between number 5 and 6. I forgive them, because by that point, I'm still not bored at all. It's no flaw that some tracks work more as transitions than songs on their own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c better that than sticking them into unrelated songs as bridges, and better to have some songs that are to the point and others that are technical mishmash. Dream Theater manage to be as catchy as they'd like, when they make a point of it, and when they don't, they at least do something interesting.\n\nAs the album carries, I do start to get a little bored, especially as they back off of the metal and lay on the.. gospel? Or whatever else; even so, the beginning of the album sounds like something's starting and the end sounds like something's finishing, and the mistakes along the way are more tolerable for knowing that we managed to go somewhere. I was entertained.\n",
        "\nThis album is perfect in every way conceivable to the human mind. From beginning to end, this album never fails to deliver. The impeccable musicianship of these boys from New York shines on this album more than any other. LaBrie's vocals are emotional and powerful. Petrucci's guitar playing, and Myung's bass playing are top notch, and Portnoy and Moore deliver epic performances on drums and keys. Now that I'm done felating the band members, maybe I can get to the album.\n\nThis CD starts off with the progressive metal masterpiece \"Pull Me Under.\" As to expect, the technical prowess of Dream Theater shines on this song. From beginning to end, the lyrics drag you under, and the solo from Petrucci is definitely one of his best. The lyrical theme in this album seems to take heavy influence from Kansas' \"Dust in the Wind.\" An excellent intro to an excellent album.\n\nNext up on our metaphorical journey through this album, is the beautiful \"Another Day.\" From the Petrucci's melodic, emotional guitar intro, I knew that this song was less \"metal\" than many of the other songs on this album, but that doesn't detract from this song in the least. Complete with Soprano Saxophone and LaBrie showing off in his mid to upper range, this proves that not all progressive metal bands need to be face-meltingly heavy.\n\nThen we have what I feel is the \"worst\" song on the album, though \"worst\" on this album is \"best\" on their others. \"Take the Time\" starts off slow with Synth. work from Moore and a nice bass line from Myung culminating up to the full band playing. LaBrie's vocals at the beginning detract from this song, but not enough to keep it from losing it's \"classic\" status. Once again, he stays in his upper registers other than the mid-range at the beginning. As again, musically this song is perfect.\n\nAfter the final notes of \"Take the Time,\" we have \"Surrounded.\" From the sublime piano and LaBrie's mezzo-piano vocals at the beginning, I could tell it is another song in the vein of \"Another Day.\" Petrucci's melodic guitar playing in the middle of the song is perfect. Once again, LaBrie shows off his upper octaves.\n\nAfter LaBrie's voice fades away, we hear the opening of what is, in my opinion, the best song Dream Theater has ever performed. \"Metropolis Pt. I: The Miracle and the Sleeper.\" It is easily the most \"progressive\" song on the album in my opinion. Starting off with tambourine, we know that this song will be different. But as is the case with Dream Theater, \"different\" typically means \"amazing.\" On this song, LaBrie parks himself in his upper register, and stays there. The drums in this song, make me proud to know the name Mike Portnoy, absolutely perfect. Moore's keyboards, the guitarists once again prove their worth. The progressive interlude in this song is absolutely stunning. It contains a ridiculously insane keyboard solo from Moore, and two guitar solos from Petrucci. It's absolutely breath-taking.\n\nAs we drive out of the \"Metropolis,\" and hear the opening keyboard/guitar duet that opens up \"Under a Glass Moon,\" I experience an aural orgasm. Yes, it's that amazing. Lyrically, this song is the best on the album, musically, it's the second best on the album. However, no review of this song can be complete without mentioning Petrucci's amazing solo where he shows his blistering speed. It takes breath-taking to a whole new level. Absolutely amazing.\n\nClosing out this amazing CD is the interlude song \"Wait for Sleep,\" and the progressive epic \"Learning to Live.\" The premiere is a beautiful ballad lead by LaBrie's golden voice. However, \"Learning to Live\" is simply... amazing. A progressive metal masterpiece in every sense of the word, it is mind-shattering, 11:30 of these boys exhibiting their prodigious skill.\n\nNone of Dream Theater's subsequent works will hold a candle to their Sophomore effort. In fact, I don't think that any progressive metal album ever recorded comes close other than Pagan's Mind's \"Celestial Entrance.\" If Dream Theater, no, if ANY progressive metal band is able to overcome this standard of the genre, I will be awed.\n",
        "\nWhat if you were in a Dream Theater concert and then suddenly, the band switched to playing a bunch of Iron Maiden's songs? That is exactly what happened to the audience of Dream Theater's 2002 show in Paris, France - this is a so-called \"live bootleg\" of Iron Maiden's milestone album The Number of the Beast, played note for note, word for word, chord for chord. I'd say that's about the problem with it...what is the point in releasing this when we already have Iron Maiden's album, which features much more powerful vocals and a more energetic attitude to the whole thing? LaBrie sounds great here, almost as good as on Dream Theater's early albums, but his voice doesn't necessarily stack up to Dickinson's charismatic operatic bellow when he's doing Maiden's songs, not by a long shot. The music is played strictly by the Bible of Maiden, not adding anything new to the songs (with the exception of \"Gangland\", which I'll get to shortly) or improving them at all. Ironic, considering the band I'm reviewing here.\n\nThis is quite entertaining though, just because it's Dream Theater doing Maiden songs. I mean, it's like when you see a one eyed man walking down the street; you just can't help stopping and watching (or in this case, listening). We're all human, and when something like this comes along, the usual reaction would be to want to hear it, just for the sake of it. And while there really is no point to this at all, it's pretty cool to hear Maiden solos done in Petrucci fashion (check \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" especially), no matter what anybody else says. Oh, and the song \"Gangland\" is certainly an eyebrow-raiser here, transformed from a simple, catchy rock song into a sprawling, 70s prog rock tribute. The lyrics are now extremely unfitting for such a slow, spacey, abstract song, but the music is good Dream Theater fodder for fans of that sort of thing. Not bad at all.\n\nWhile this obviously pales in comparison to Maiden's timeless classic of a heavy metal record, it's a nice little tribute, and fans of both Maiden and Dream Theater will find at least a bit to enjoy here. Recommended.\n",
        "\nFew bands polarise opinion quite as much as Dream Theater. Their fans tend to be the most rabidly devout around while their critics are never shy about throwing in accusations of soulless, self-indulgent wankery. Whichever side of the divide you happen to fall into, there is no denying the importance of the band to progressive music \u2013 any band writing labyrinthine songs at the dawn of the 90s were obviously going against the grain, and Dream Theater's place in the annals of metal history was secured long ago. \n\nIt is, however, also almost unquestionably true that their output over more recent releases has been a very patchy one, with their CDs teetering precariously between the sublime and the atrocious across individual songs and the final product often ending up a rather unsatisfying mixed bag. \n\nSadly, 'Systematic chaos' will not be the CD that breaks them out of this malaise, and is just as unbalanced and frustrating as its immediate predecessor, 'Octavarium', with some highly impressive songs hamstrung by some truly awful occurrences. \n\nThe best example of this bipolar scenario is probably the song \"The dark eternal night\", which breaks jarringly between some brilliant progressive music - the sort of stuff Dream Theater can do in their sleep, of course, but still sonically astonishing \u2013 and some truly gruesome nu-metal rubbish, complete with de-tuned stop-start guitars and shouty tough-guy vocals. It seemed that with 'Octavarium' the band had learned their lesson after the nu-metal dabbling on the 'Train of thought' CD, but unfortunately they have decided to have another go at it here \u2013 cynics may find it a little more than coincidental that this has happened on their debut CD for Roadrunner Records. \n\nIt's a shame that the CD is dragged down by some questionable shifts in style, since the 'straightforward' progressive metal on some of the songs really is fantastic. The 2 parts of \"The presence of enemies\" that bookend the remaining 6 songs are probably the strongest cuts here, with over half of the first part being an instrumental tour-de-force before vocalist James Labrie finally gets in on the action and delivers an assured performance. \n\nLabrie's overall display is as frustratingly divisive as the rest of the band \u2013 when he just gets on with singing in his usual emotional, operatic style he is as good as always \u2013 the gargantuan progressive ballad \"The ministry of lost souls\" has him performing at his very best. It is when he starts trying to sound aggressive that his delivery becomes almost comical. The James Hetfield impression he attempts on \"Constant motion\", right down to the vocal melodies, is a woefully misguided addition to what is a pretty insipid song anyway. \n\nThe problem they have most likely stems from the fact that, as a self-proclaimed progressive band, Dream Theater feel as though they should not be seen to be standing still, and feel obliged to show they can incorporate any sort of modern rock influences from nu-metal to Muse. It may be that it would be less adventurous of them to continue turning out music in the same style they are known for, but the end result would almost certainly be better and far more consistent. Even pretentious progressive bands are allowed to stick to what they know \u2013 Dream Theater have nothing to prove to anyone, and can do a lot better than this by simply writing variations on the style of music that earned them their status in the first place. 'Systematic chaos' is a CD with as many good songs as it has bad, and this is doubly frustrating when you consider the sheer quality of the good ones. On that kind of form, Dream Theater could have written the best CD of 2007, but their insistence on mixing and matching has cost them once again. \n\n(Originally written for http://www.metalcdratings.com/)\n",
        "\nThis DVD covers most of Dream Theater's August 30th set at the New York Roseland Ballroom on the 2000 Metropolis Tour. The main 'programme' as it were is the first set of the night, when the band performed the entire Scenes From A Memory album. It's pretty much incredible. It's probably my favourite Dream Theater album and to see the guys themselves play it in all its glory (and a little more) is very interesting. Almost everything you hear on the album (including the hypnotist from the beginning and end of the album, and the choir) is performed live, and aside from a couple of off-key notes from James LaBrie, everything is performed to perfection. Even the bizarrely technical Dance Of Eternity is nailed. I think the only thing wrong with it is, as others have said, the video effects that have been put on the performance. There's loads of splitscreens, odd psychedelic effects and plenty of, as the band put it \"Japanese seizure moments\". While it can be quite useful to see what each band member is doing during the really technical moments, sometimes it's just annoying and takes away from the mysterious atmosphere of the story the album tells.\n\nThe bonus material includes a documentary including interviews with Kevin Shirley (DT's mixing engineers) and several fans, most of whom aren't very clever. \"The best thing about them is the songs.\" No shit. The documentary in general is quite dull but you get some laughs out of these fans who are clearly are a bit strange. There wasn't an awful lot that was 'behind the scenes', just concert footage, fans and Kevin Shirley, which disappointed me especially when their other DVDs normally expose a lot of light on the process of making a Dream Theater release.\n\nDream Theater played two sets that night, unfortunately only five songs were put on the DVD (well, 3 songs basically as it includes A Mind Beside Itself), but they're performed perfectly as usual. There's a photo gallery played over a medley of DT songs, which is really little more than a lot of crowds from different places they've been on the tour. \n\nThe best thing about this DVD, though is the audio commentary by the band. It's only available for the Scenes From A Memory set but it was very interesting and connected together a lot of pieces of the musical puzzle that the album is. There were a few references to other songs that I hadn't noticed before which were pointed out by the guys, and especially the story of the album becamse fully clear after watching it, because along with the video projections of a dramatization of key moments of the story and images, Petrucci explains what James is singing about at that point, and how it all fits in. I now fully understand the story, and the rather mysterious ending which before left me rather underwhelmed, but now I understand the full situation it makes a lot of sense.\n\nIf you're a big fan of the Scenes From A Memory album, then this is a great purchase, but it should really be seen anyway just because live Dream Theater is a great thing to watch.\n",
        "\nEasily the best album of their official bootleg cover series. The band seamlessly and almost effortlessly transition from track to track as if they had written the album themselves, and in a live setting no less. The second disc contains bonus Floyd songs performed throughout their career including the song, 'Echoes' in its entirety (one of my personal favorite Floyd songs), 'Hey You,' and an awesome simultaneous performance of 'Comfortably Numb' with Queensryche.\n\nStarting with CD 1; this truly showcases the bands appreciation and admiration for such a classic album by not foiling with the solos, tempos, or intricacies that made this album what it is. Even though you know Petrucci is itching to bust out and shred, or that Portnoy wishes he could use some double bass, the band restrains and plays the album virtually note for note, fill for fill, tempo for tempo.\n\nThe slide guitar parts in 'Speak to me/Breathe,' are provided by Jordan Rudess (on what looked like a lap-steel guitar mounted on his keyboard on teh DVD) and maintain their original luster. His solos in 'Any Colour You Like' are also phenomenal. The vocal solo for 'The Great Gig in the Sky' (as well as backing vocal parts for other songs) was done by non other than 'Scenes from a Memory' alum, Theresa Thomason. Her stunning replication of this powerful aria will send shivers down your spine, as will the crowds response to her (she received, literally, the loudest ovation on the entire cd). On saxophone for 'Money' (and others) and adding a bit of nostalgia to the mix is Norbert Stachel formerly of the Roger Waters Band, who sounded right at home diving into the sax solos.\n\nLabrie does a surprisingly stellar job. The vocal lines seem to be perfect for his range, but his little bit of feminism manages to creep its way into some of the parts making it sound a little weird. Labries performance ultimately is what keeps this from being a perfect 100%. Although, it's only sub-par enough to warrant a measly 5 point deduction, as his overall performance is one of his best I've ever heard.\n\nThe second CD is a compilation of Floyd songs recorded from several different live shows and sound checks over the course of their career. DT has a real knack for covering Pink Floyd songs as they again play through the songs without error. The finale of the second CD is a cool rendition of Comfortable Numb in which the band plays simultaneously with Queensryche (2 drummers, 2 bassists, 3 guitarists, and 2 vocalists trading off the vocal lines). Petrucci does a fine job of not mucking up the two solos that make this song so great by playing both of them note for note (although, he goes shred crazy at the very end, but who can blame him), and the two drummers are in synch the whole way.\n\nOverall, this album is a must for any fan of DT and Floyd. Get it anywhere you can find it!\n",
        "\nI'm not against covers, if a band can cover another band it shows a certain kind of versatility, and that's pretty sweet. But this is a fucking waste of hard drive space. It's a good cover, don't get me wrong. Sounds just like Metallica. That's the thing though, why not just get a live version of Metallica playing the CD? It would sound essentially the same, but not shitty bootleg quality and with audible vocals by a man for and by whom they were written.\n\nI was expecting Metallica with that Dream Theater tinge to it. What I got was precisely the album's music, played by Dream Theater (whoopdee fuckin doo) and a fucking sing a long involving the whole crowd to the lyrics. You can make out Labrie's voice (he doesn't do the harsh vocals thing very well) on the parts where not everyone in the audience knows the lyrics, but even then it sounds like the PA is facing a wall that's 3 feet away.\n\nDon't waste your time. I gave it a 30 only because it *is* a well done cover (what can you expect from Dream Theater, though?). The shitty quality, combined with the fact that they're playing an album to which everyone knows they lyrics makes it recycle bin material.\n",
        "\nSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence is the template on which all Dream Theater albums since have been modelled off. It begins with some amazing tracks, but then collapses into an absolute pile of shit, as this talented group of musicians get stuck in ballad mode, and thus cancel out their talent. Not to mention they get mindlessly pretentious and whiny in the lyrics. This is basically what has happened on all albums since, but never on this scale. Why? Because this gets dull at \"Misunderstood\". And is well and truly as boring as anything they've ever done by the end of \"Disappear\". This would be a pretty good DT album at this point, because \"The Great Debate\" isn't too bad, so there's probably over 50% quality on offer, which is pretty good for the band...\n\nBut then we get a whole 42 minute album tacked on the end without a solid minute of quality on it. Completely dragging down the quality of the album.\n\nThis album doesn't suffer from the usual complaint of mindless wankery, the problem is there isn't enough wankery. You could hardly call \"The Glass Prison\" direct and too the point, but it works. It's long, complex, and it holds your attention throughout it's entirety, and the fact that it's 14 minutes long is merely an after thought. Compare that to \"Misunderstood\", which spends about 80% of its time being soft. It just doesn't make sense; surely a band of this technical ability couldn't find enjoyment in writing this much simplistic music.\n\nBoth the albums both have a completely different sound to them. The production is always clear and precise, but the standard and style of playing is miles apart. The guitar work is powerful, majestic and quite complex and fast... On the first disk. However, when it comes to the second album, Pettruci seems to forget that he has the ability to be amazingly complex, yet engaging, and basically decides that he isn't needed, and writes support material to the keyboards. Jordan Rudess himself is quite tolerable for the first 50 minutes, interacting with the guitars, and more or less created a solid canvas for the band to build off. On the second album, he's the only thing you'll hear as he wanks his was from section to section. Mike Portnoy is in the same boat with the drums. Amazing on the metal tracks, boring as watching a hourglass filled with mud on the other ones.\n\nThe final weapon in Dream Theater's arsenal is of course, the usually phenomenal James LaBrie, who we see beginning to show weakness. There's a lot of vocal distortion starting to creep in, not as much as what will come on the next two subsequent albums, but enough to get a little on the irritating side, and then you've got the lyrics. Now, I know that Portnoy is responsible for a lot of the lyrics, so I can't blame it all on him. But there are some serious duds here. \"She doesn't wear make up, no one would care if she did anyway\", \"She was praised as the perfect teenage girl, and everyone though highly of her\" come to mind, along with other pointless observations, and his classic rhyming of like 60 lines in a row with the same syllable. For instance, the first chorus of \"About the Crash\", we get these rhyming words, 'by, try, eyes, high, fly, sky, by (again)'. That's all in about a twenty second period. It hurts. \n\nReally, the first disk is at a high quality. The first two songs are easily amongst the bands finest efforts. And \"The Great Debate\" is solid despite some lyrics which aren't quite balanced or technically correct, eg. 'taking life to save life'. \"Misunderstood\" and \"Disappear\" are boring, overlong, pretentious angst-fests. But overall it's a good disk. But then we get the 42 minute final track, which is, in the kindest way I can put it, devoid of quality and completely worthless.\n\nBasically, of the 42 minutes, almost 13 minutes are spent on unnecessary intros and outros. Which are basically cheesy medieval overtures, with some metallic instruments thrown in, \u201cLosing Time/Grand Finale\u201d has some lyrics added, but it's still got lots of big cheesy keyboards and trumpet samples. Somehow, in practice it actually sounds worse than it looks on paper. It sounds like the castle music in a Legend of Zelda video game, with an electric guitar section which imitates the silly music. So Six Degrees of inner Turbulance itself is only about half an hour long. It's like making a film with 2 hours of credits, and an hour of content, and then claiming that you made a three hour epic.\n\nUnfortunately, the actual song in the middle isn't an improvement; it starts and ends with pretty much the same 5 minute section of music, \"About to Crash\" and \"About to crash (Reprise)\", which sounds like an introduction song to a new sitcom. The lyrics are repulsive; think of how many words you can rhyme with 'sky', the chorus of this song will name all the answers you can think of, and some more. Musically it's dull, mainly piano based, and guitar work when used is dull and boring, merely supporting the piano work. It has no positive elements at all. To think that they repeat this part again at the end of the song...\n\nThings get a little better and darker after this, for about 7 minutes. The keys are still more dominant than the guitars, and LaBrie's vocals are often delivered badly or played around with in post production, resulting in elements being worse than they had to be, There's only like three solos in the song, none of which are at DT standard, instead of the usual complex instrumentation, the main focus of the solos are on of from interaction with the keys, or on odd distortions on the guitar. I guess this middle section of this song isn't unbearable; it's just not any good either. This slight improvement doesn't last, because there's about 12 minutes of boring, poppy, low quality, ballad put in until the final outro closes out in its pathetic manner, just in case you get too stimulated by the 7 minutes of actual moving music that preceded it. \n\nThere, that sums up the title track in three paragraphs. Nothing goes right. 12 minutes could be trimmed, about 25 minutes of what\u2019s left absolutely sucks and the remnants are a sign of the chunkiness of the next two album's heavy sections. So those parts are not even that good.\n\nTo be honest, the album is worth getting, because the first disk is definitely a good listen, with several good ideas thrown about. And the band was nice enough to keep the whole of the terrible mess of a sixth track on a separate disk, allowing you to almost forget its existence, but it's still there, so its awful wreckage cannot be completely ignored. It's like seeing someone break into your house, not stealing anything or causing any damage, but you know they've been there. No real harm comes of it, but I'll be damned if it doesn't piss you off. \n\nI guess they wrote they second album, realised that if they sold it on it's own it'd never be given a review of higher than 10%, so they bundled it with a superior album to hopefully avoid drawing attention. I hate to say this, but despite the flat 50% rating on the album overall, I still have to recommend getting \"Six Degrees...\", purely because of the first disk. Just throw the other one away before listening to it. Maybe then you'll be able to deny its existence.\n",
        "\nAs the leading force of progressive metal, Dream Theater\u2019s live shows are always geared specifically towards giving something special to the loyal, long-time fans, thanks to drummer Mike Portnoy\u2019s \u2018rotating set-list.\u2019 By keeping extensive records of which songs were played at which locations over the band\u2019s numerous world tours, Portnoy strives to ensure that fans get something new from each Dream Theater show, and that extends to those listening to the concert in their own home or car in the form of officially recorded live albums.\n\nReleased in 2004 to chronicle the Japanese leg of the tour for \u2018Train of Thought,\u2019 \u2018Live at Budokan\u2019 is no predictable \u2018greatest hits\u2019 set-list, revised only ever-so-slightly from the last live album to accommodate new songs alongside the old favourites. There is an expected small degree of overlap with 2000\u2019s \u2018Live Scenes From New York,\u2019 1997\u2019s \u2018Once in a Livetime\u2019 and 1992\u2019s \u2018Live at the Marquee,\u2019 but even with such an extensive live discography, only five out of eighteen songs have been released in this manner before. That leaves thirteen songs that have never before been released live, a mixture of mostly newer material released after Live Scenes From New York, and consciously differentiated picks from 1990s albums.\n\nDream Theater is fond of celebrating every stage of its career with live releases (Portnoy even having set up Ytse Jam Records to release so-called \u2018Official Bootlegs\u2019 of notable shows that Elektra Records would have no real interest in promoting), and each release is obviously tailored largely to promote the most recent studio release, in this case 2003\u2019s Train of Thought. Five of that album\u2019s seven songs are included across the enormous three disc set (or one disc if watching the DVD version, but I don\u2019t have that). As it\u2019s one of my least favoured of their studio albums, this live release was jeapordised a little before it even started playing, but as an account of the live Dream Theater experience it has yet to be beaten.\n\nDream Theater is a progressive metal band, combining the song-writers\u2019 love of classic progressive rock and more recent heavy metal, though the band\u2019s constant evolution with each album (obviously enhanced by their pioneering prog spirit) sees the \u2018metal\u2019 in question move with current trends. This collection includes songs from 1989 (\u2018Only a Matter of Time\u2019) and 1992 (\u2018Pull Me Under\u2019), both of which are firmly rooted in the eighties metal mentality: high pitched vocals, slow grooving guitar riffs and poppy synthesisers. The same elements are in place that would characterise the band\u2019s entire career, but the attitude of these particular songs, and not necessarily the albums they were taken from, is to be accessible pop metal with a tinge of prog in the vein of Rush and Queensr\u00ffche, the two most obvious influences. Still acting as the more accessible tracks on this release by being performed in a mostly unaltered fashion and also having the benefit of being the \u2018old favourites,\u2019 the distinctly retro sound makes them stand out against the more modern, heavier material, and the contrast would have been more effective and less jarring if some of the more experimental and notable songs from those early albums had been chosen instead (but of course, there\u2019s the issue of the rotating set-list!)\n\nThe next stage of evolution that is charted is rather oddly the black sheep of Dream Theater releases, 1997\u2019s \u2018Falling into Infinity.\u2019 Rather than focusing on its excellent predecessor \u2018Awake,\u2019 which arguably perfected the fusion between classic heavy metal and prog, this album was produced under the scrutiny of a record label that wanted something more radio-friendly, so it\u2019s quite a surprise to see three songs (\u2018Hollow Years,\u2019 \u2018Trial of Tears\u2019 and \u2018New Millennium\u2019) celebrated here. If the purpose is to contrast starkly with the crushing riffs of Train of Thought material and the insane keyboard shenanigans of the instrumentals, then it certainly works, but it raises the question of who this album is intended for. Only die-hard Dream Theater fans would fork out for a three-disc live album with an average song length of ten minutes each, but those same fans would be turned away by the inclusion of such weak material. It\u2019s a common perception that there are two schools of Dream Theater fans, each preferring either their early or late career (I certainly belong to the former), and while the Falling into Infinity album is fortunately the weak point in the middle that neither tribe has to like, the newer fans that this album caters more towards aren\u2019t going to appreciate such a diversion. \u2018New Millennium\u2019 is essentially a pop-rock songs in the wake of grunge, while \u2018Hollow Years\u2019 is mostly led by piano, like a couple of other songs already included here. Only \u2018Trial of Tears\u2019 could disguise itself as a more experimental song due to its length, but it\u2019s not a very interesting or eventful journey, even if the chorus is quite nice.\n\nThat brings us to the majority of the album, which is taken from albums in Dream Theater\u2019s more recent, continuing phase. The emphasis of this period is more on a conflict between crushing heaviness, probably inspired by the emergence of so-called \u2018nu metal\u2019 in the late 90s more than death metal, balanced out by a softer side of soaring guitar melodies and light keyboards. The live experience begins with a demonstration of Dream Theater at its most uncompromising, pounding through the first two songs from Train of Thought (\u2018As I Am\u2019 and \u2018This Dying Soul\u2019) followed by a ridiculously extended version of the heaviest offering from 1999\u2019s Scenes From a Memory (\u2018Beyond This Life.\u2019) This is all about satisfying modern Dream Theater fans, which is no bad thing, and it was probably an intentional decision to alienate any new listeners not bold enough to face this challenge rather than try to suck them in with the poppier offerings from later on. The first two songs have a little improvisation added from the year-old studio tracks, but it\u2019s pretty much the same deal as the whole Train of Thought album: songs based on fast and heavily down-tuned guitar riffs with aggressive vocals and even a very small dose of rap, something it took me a while to get over. It\u2019s a little more pleasing to hear these songs in the live environment, as the original studio production was a little too muddy and imposing for me, and although these aren\u2019t Dream Theater songs I would listen to very often at all, they\u2019re memorable and accomplished, if a little too long.\n\n\u2018Beyond This Life\u2019 was the first Dream Theater song I heard many years ago, and it gets the balance between heavy and prog right on the nose, helped by a fantastic and instantly recognisable riff that the band can\u2019t help but head-bang along to. Even the original version tries my patience at eleven minutes, breaking into a jam and improv for the second half, so I don\u2019t exactly find this double length version the most riveting listen ever. Nevertheless, a lot of fans do, and this would be particularly suited to those who enjoy rock instrumental improvisations from the likes of the Dream Theater side-project \u2018Liquid Tension Experiment.\u2019 For those that don\u2019t enjoy this type of thing... well, you\u2019ll at least be safe for the rest of this disc.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, \u2018Hollow Years\u2019 is a fairly nice and inoffensive ballad of sorts, in the acoustic guitar, piano and soft singing way more than an Aerosmith power ballad, and its extension to nine minutes is more relaxing than imposing. The last two songs are extracts from the band\u2019s eight-completely-different-songs-that-pretend-they\u2019re-one-song epic \u2018Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u2019 from the 2001 album of the same name, which would later be released in a complete live form on the next live album in 2006. \u2018War Inside My Head\u2019 is a fairly inconsequential starter piece that brings things back around to heaviness, while \u2018The Test That Stumped Them All\u2019 is the band wishing they were Pantera, but a little better, with quite a cool groove metal song bringing back the aggression of the first three tracks in a more concise manner. This is what the first disc has mostly been about, with lapses into a softer side and keyboard and guitar masturbation, and the others take a little more time out to explore the full extent of the band\u2019s capabilities.\n\nThe second disc is again dominated by three very long opening songs, this time all very different. \u2018Endless Sacrifice\u2019 is another new one from Train of Thought, and it\u2019s a little slower and more thoughtful, sort of a love song to guitarist John Petrucci\u2019s wife (but sung by vocalist James LaBrie. I\u2019d watch out if I were him). This is probably my least favourite song on the entire album, largely because it bores me by dragging on towards the end without offering anything new, though the crowd seems to be into it. The later \u2018Trial of Tears\u2019 similarly tries my patience, but being an older song it sounds more fitting to the melancholy it\u2019s trying to evoke by not shoving a down-tuned riff down my throat. The lyrics are memorable, and as with its previous live appearance on Once in a Livetime, the band mess around with the introduction for their own amusement.\n\nIn-between these slower pieces is the mania of the bold \u2018Instrumedley,\u2019 likely the high point of this whole album for avid Dream Theater fanatics who enjoy analysing all the clues and \u2018easter eggs\u2019 in the band\u2019s composition, album art and lyrics. This piece is anchored in the instrumental recording \u2018The Dance of Eternity\u2019 from Scenes From a Memory, which was itself based around the earlier song \u2018Metropolis Part 1,\u2019 and that source song is also featured by the guitar, bass, drums and keyboards alongside selected and recognisable extracts from Dream Theater\u2019s other official instrumentals \u2018Ytse Jam\u2019 (1989), \u2018Erotomania\u2019 (1994) and \u2018Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019 (1997), also featuring clips from the band\u2019s genuine and brilliant 1995 epic \u2018A Change of Seasons\u2019 and material from the afore-mentioned Liquid Tension Experiment side-project of the majority of band members. It may be too zany for newcomers, but it\u2019s a lot of fun trying to spot all the instances being quoted, which also keeps it fresh and exciting throughout, certainly a unique highlight of this recording. The rest of this second disc is unfortunately as disappointing as the beginning, with \u2018New Millennium\u2019 pointlessly revived from the 1997 album, and \u2018A Matter of Time\u2019 sounding a little too out-of-date alongside the Instrumedley and subsequent \u2018Keyboard Solo\u2019 from Jordan Rudess, rather dull but permissable for being only a few minutes long and in the interests of fairness after his predecessor Derek Sherinian\u2019s solo spot on Once in a Livetime.\n\nThe third and final disc is thankfully a little better, changing the formula to avoid over-long songs for the most part and focusing on a wider range of source material. \u2018Goodnight Kiss\u2019 and \u2018Solitary Shell\u2019 continue the Six Degrees epic from where \u2018The Test That Stumped Them All\u2019 left off on disc one, though the hour break is a little confusing and makes me wonder why this wasn\u2019t the second disc in the set. These songs offer a more melodic perspective than the Pantera-esque heaviness of the earlier instalments, the first being, as expected from the title, a soft love song almost like a lullaby (but with better guitars), and the second being a little incessantly catchy and quite good in a very pop-rock way, even if the main melody is a complete rip-off of Faith No More\u2019s \u2018Everything\u2019s Ruined.\u2019 \u2018Disappear\u2019 is also from Six Degrees, but doesn\u2019t form a part of the suite that the others have, standing alone and strong as another fairly derivative pop-rock song, this time more like Radiohead. In perhaps the only instance on this album, this live version is actually shorter than the original. The penultimate \u2018Pull Me Under\u2019 is the band\u2019s first and perhaps only MTV hit, but has appeared on enough live albums to be rendered quite obsolete and dull by now.\n\nThe two new songs on this final disc are likely the most interesting picks from Train of Thought, the really unhinged instrumental \u2018Stream of Consciousness\u2019 and the bleak religious diatribe \u2018In the Name of God.\u2019 The first runs along similar lines to the earlier Instrumedley, very carefully planned and executed with a very complex structure I won\u2019t even begin to attempt to explain. It\u2019s incredibly demanding, but unlike the extended jams which merely seem to go off on one, this is a fantastic piece of music and the peak of Dream Theater\u2019s instrumentals, perhaps the reason they haven\u2019t released another one on the two albums since. \u2018In the Name of God\u2019 attacks religious leaders in the wake of September 11th and is a little depressing as the song to go out on, another reason it might have been prudent to switch the second and third discs around (if anyone was ever planning on listening to this in its entirety). The main riff is slow and heavy, but in a more careful and interesting style than the similarly downbeat \u2018Endless Sacrifice,\u2019 and although the choir chant carries on for a little too long at the end, it at least proves that Train of Thought wasn\u2019t completely worthless.\n\n\u2018Live at Budokan\u2019 was the second three-disc live album from Dream Theater, and not the last. With the band\u2019s patience-demanding song lengths and even more frustrating extensions into jams, a two disc release wouldn\u2019t cover much ground at all, and certainly wouldn\u2019t allow the newer material to be properly set against the band\u2019s extensive back catalogue. The newer material does work a lot better in this context, although I still don\u2019t appreciate the style as much as I do the earlier (and later) works, and as this is unavoidably the \u2018Train of Thought Live Album\u2019 in essence, it wouldn\u2019t be my first choice to listen to with all the others out there, which pay more attention to more enjoyable material.\n\nThe \u2018Instrumedley\u2019 and the live version of \u2018Stream of Consciousness\u2019 make this a necessary purchase for fans more interested in the band\u2019s extreme experimental side, and their inclusion here means that they probably won\u2019t show up on a live release again, at least not for several years. This is where Portnoy\u2019s rotating set-list is a double-edged sword, providing something new with each live release for fans who have all of them, but also, essentially, requiring fans to buy all of them in the first place. As a consequence of this release, 2006\u2019s \u2018Score\u2019 features the worthwhile song \u2018Vacant\u2019 from Train of Thought (leaving only the worthless \u2018Honor Thy Father\u2019 unreleased in this form), while also collecting the entire \u2018Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u2019 epic together for the first time, similar to the collection of \u2018A Change of Seasons\u2019 on the 2001 live album after bits and pieces made their way into Once in a Livetime.\n\nAfter the release of the next studio album, mostly likely in 2009 as one has only just been released this year, Portnoy has expressed his wish to perform and record his entire Alcoholics Anonymous suite in its entirety, which ought to be a fairly tedious hour of music but will also make the inclusion of \u2018This Dying Soul\u2019 here (written as parts four and five of the suite) and \u2018The Root of All Evil\u2019 on the following live album (parts six and seven) irrelevant in hindsight. At least there will finally be a live version of the criminally overlooked \u2018The Glass Prison\u2019 (parts one to three) from Six Degrees album, which really should have replaced one of the weaker fifteen minute songs on this live recording. Portnoy\u2019s preoccupation with getting everything possible released in a live form will doubtless damage future live releases if allowed to remain unchecked, and already appears to have affected this release with the apparent performance of \u2018Millennium\u2019 merely because it hadn\u2019t been done yet. \u2018Live at Budokan\u2019 is primarily a mixture of weak Train of Thought material and an edited version of an epic suite that would be released more definitively later, and aside from interesting instrumentals it can probably be written off as an inessential purchase, whatever the completist drummer would have us believe.\n",
        "\n'Pull Me Under' is maybe the most well known song from Dream Theater, and some considers it to their best ever. It has the deep and well written lyrics of keyboardist 'Kevin Moore' (there were some rumors claimed that the lyrics content are about his thoughts of leaving the band, which he actually did, but it's unknown if this song has something with that) and the mystic atmosphere that had been in their astonishing album 'Images And Words'.\n\nThe production...perfect. One of the best productions I've ever heard. Each instrument sounds blazing, clear, powerful and topnotched. It doesn't feels like an overproduced album, it feels like it had been brushed exactly until it's absoulte saturation point.\n\nThe songs begins with a guitar transfering you into a relaxing mood with it's calmly pluckings and delay effect, then the synthesizer comes in and adds a different vibe for the atmosphere. The drums comes in and the songs continues to flows and progress until the first verse. Now Labrie comes in with it's wonderful, clean and soft voice, the song raising more atmosphere, the intensity grows up until the chorus when everything explodes into orgasmic and wonderful moment. The chorus is also pretty catchy, and helped this single catch the highest positions in the music charts. There is also a mindblowing orgasmic solo in 6:10, which shows that this band not only got an outstanding technique, they got also incredible pure emotions, and this is one of Petrucci's best solos, just a classic one. The song simply stops after eight minutes, just like someone pushed the record button at the wrong time, and it's a bit awkward at first listenings, but when you get deep to this song, you understand that this ending just emphasizes the theme of it, which is about the nature life and the unexpected death.\n\nIn conclusion: it's an awesome songs, it workespretty well as single and it is a great intensive opener for the 'Images And Words' LP. I don't know if there are a lot of people who don't know this song, but if you never heard it before, you surely can't miss that one. It is on the greatest songs that defienes the prog metal essence, in my opinion.\n",
        "\nSystematic Chaos is an eight track album and much like Dream Theater's other works is a musical progression in it's entirety - that is, the songs aren't only progressive as individual peices, but the whole album uses recurring themes to bring the album together. The nature of the vocals and each song's individual theme leave the intent and interperatation of the album quite open. For example, the 6th track, \"Prophets Of War\" explores the futility and pointlessness of modern warfare, however on the demo, the spelling was \"Profits Of War\" which is much more in line with the lyrics, but one can't help but wonder as to the intention of such a change.\n\nThe musicianship is nothing less than brilliant, and Dream Theater's seamless musical progressions continue to earn praise. The melodic content in the performances of LaBrie and Petrucci leave little, if anything, to be desired. Many would catagorise John Petrucci as a player who prizes technique over expression, but this reviewer would happily use Systematic Chaos against that argument - there's plenty of material there for the shred-heads, but for those who like a more restrained style of soloing there is some brilliant work. See track seven, \"The Ministry Of Lost Souls\" in particular for such a performance. As usual, LaBrie can move from Hetfield-esque rhythmic vocals to hyper-melodic wailing in an instant. Myung and Portnoy bring up the rhythm section skillfully as usual, although their work is rather overshadowed during softer moments in the album. \n\nRecurring melodic and rhythmic themes have always been a part of the sound of Dream Theater and Systematic Chaos displays this quite well. The first, seventh and eighth tracks make the best use of this, leaving the other five tracks as relative freeform performances. Track five, \"Repentance\", is possibly one of the best songs released during the year from any metal band and features a guest performance from Steve Vai. The final words of the song linger with the listener and lend themselves thematically to the next track. The next track, \"Prophets Of War\", includes a rap interlude that hasn't gone down well with some fans, although given the context of the song, they are quite appropriate. Irrespective, the song closes in a way that is sympathetic to the beginning of \"The Ministry Of Lost Souls\", thus signalling the beginning of the end for the album. \"Forsaken\", \"Consant Motion\" and \"The Dark Eternal Night\" act more like precursors to the other tracks than anything, but it would be incorrect to label them as \"filler\". From \"Repentance\" onward, there is a continuous fluxuation of tension, whereas from \"Forsaken\" to \"The Dark Eternal Night\" there isn't such a large shift, giving a sense of continuity in comparison to the highs and lows of the later track. Summarised, the album begins straightforward (that is, for a Dream Theater album) and continuously gets more progressive. \n\nSystematic Chaos, in a word, DELIVERS. With a combination of brilliantly planned progressions, top-notch musicianship and new musical ideas while holding onto the sounds that make Dream Theater so unqiue and interesting, I would highly reccomend this album to any fan of progressive metal, metal or progressive music in general. Even if you're a casual listener, the melodic vocals of LaBrie will keep you interested, and for those more interested in the building blocks of the songs and the instrumental parts, there's a wealth of sound to explore.\n",
        "\nThe name Dream Theater has come to be symbolic of many different elements over the years. Expressive lyrical imagery. Technical skills. The combination of both heaviness and progressive tendencies. They're the shining beacon of prog metal, according to some, and seemingly destined to go down in heavy metal lore. Over their now 22 year career they've shown the potential to reach amazing highs, such as with their 1999 album, Scenes From a Memory, or their epic song, Metropolis, Pt. 1 The Miracle and the Sleeper, off the Images and Words album. But unfortunately, as the allegedly \"definitive band\" of progressive metal, Dream Theater has almost always seemed to run into the same problems the entire scene faces. They're incredibly pretentious. At times their music can drag on far longer than it should. The band forsakes emotion for technical proficiency. These criticisms have always followed the band from album to album, and with their 2007 record, Systematic Chaos, such criticisms remain present.\n\nBut before we delve into negativity, what does this, the ninth Dream Theater album, do well? Well for starters, for a grand total of two tracks, the American band manages to impress. The opening song, In the Presence of Enemies Pt. 1 is a fairly good attempt at an epic track. Each member of the band compliments his partners rather well, as they all make us of their technical prowess without trying to grab the spotlight from one another. Though the band wastes no time in getting into \"pretentious prog metal wankery mode,\" they somehow find a way to make the song captivating and interesting. The seemingly endless time changes, overflowing with guitar, keyboard, drum, and bass lines feel as though they do, in fact have a purpose and are not just there for the sake of having a long song. When James enters the song, the band eases up on the progressiveness and the band adds some emotion into the track. The other track is Prophets of War. A fairly accessible song, the track is built upon a steady diet of catchy riffs and synths. Think Dream Theater meets electronically driven alt rock. Surprisingly it works out very well, with the song's mournful main riff being the highlight and most memorable part of the album. \n\nThe thing I like the most about Dream Theater is how they work as a band. Like I mentioned before, each musician completes the other extremely well, giving the band a very balanced musical formula. Dream Theater impressively play as though they were a single entity; none of the instruments impede each other in any way, each aspect of their musical attack is given room to leave its mark upon the song , be it through intricate guitar riffs, flashy keyboards, or heart pounding drumming. And they do it time and time again, through songs such as the aforementioned In the Presence of Enemies Pt. 1, Ministry of Lost Souls, and Pt. 2 of In the Presence of Enemies. However, as the old saying goes, (one of) the band's greatest strength(s) is also (one of) their greatest weakness(es). As well as each of Petrucci, Myung, Portnoy, and Rudess perform together, when they begin their noodling they fall into an almost machine-like routine which saps much of the life and emotion out of the song they had just built up. Anybody who knows the band knows that they are all very talented musicians, and such a fact renders the long, interweaving passages rather useless. \n\nSuch song writing tendencies is the root Systematic Chaos' greatest disappointment. This disappointment surrounds the second to last song on the record, Ministry of Lost Souls. The first 7 minutes of the song are fantastic, and quite easily some of the best material which Dream Theater has ever written. The track is a slow, dark ballad flowing to the brim with emotion through long, quiet riffs Labrie's soft vocal efforts, and soothing synths. It's quite an enjoyable and relaxing piece, and though it does not contain the energy of an Overture 1928 or a Home, it manages to retain a sense of interest. The song would have been superb had it ended at around the 7:20 point (and as it could have made a convincing ending, the way it fades out), and could possibly have contended with Prophets of War as song of the album. But it doesn't stop. Instead Dream Theater cranks up the distortion, slams the pedal to the metal (pardon the pun), and begins pumping out yet another senseless four minute instrumental section. Only unlike the opening track, in Ministry of Lost Souls, the dark, heavy riff fest does not fit the song at all. It's as pointless and inappropriate as they come. The band attempts to repent for their sins by reverting back to the tranquillity of the first seven minutes, though seeing as the song could have ended four to five minutes earlier, it is a rather pointless exercise. \n\nThe rest of the songs aren't anything to write home about. Constant Motion features Dream Theater attempting to play Trivium in ripping off Metallica's sound. Through James' identity crisis (your last name is Labrie, not Hetfield), lacklustre chugging riffs, and well lack of direction for seven minutes, the song is a certifiable train wreck. Repentance has drawn comparisons with the likes of Porcupine Tree or Damnation-era Opeth, but the main difference here is that Repentance has no real hooks, and lacks the emotional power and effort which the aforementioned artists apply to their music. After the massacre of Ministry of Lost Souls, I must say that it was quite the audacious decision to follow it up with the long, sixteen and a half minute piece. A sixteen minute song is difficult enough to take in, but as bands such as Symphony X, Rush, and Porcupine Tree prove, a track of such magnitude can be successfully moulded together. In The Presence of Enemies Pt. 2 is a decent effort, but ultimately does not succeed due to the tired meanderings of the various instrumental sections. \n\nLooking back, Systematic Chaos is an album that showcases a ton of potential for the band, but ultimately falls short of its goals. The American band's inclination to wander off into its own world of progression, technicality, soullessness, and noodling holds the band back for a vast majority of the album, and the twenty or so minutes where the group impresses is not enough to save the album. It's too bad really. My expectations were never all that high for Dream Theater's ninth studio album, but after Scenes From a Memory, it is quite clear that the band can do better than this. Avoid if possible.\n\n(Originally written fro Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nDream Theater\u2019s tenth release, and the first on Roadrunner, Systematic Chaos marked a new beginning for the New Yorkers. Now, before hearing it, I read a lot of comments stating that it was a lot like Train of Thought. And I can\u2019t help but agree, which is a very good thing, ToT being what it is. Chaos blends the songwriting of an Images and Words or Awake with the riffage of Train of Thought. But, as always, there is a progression in their sound. As different as Octavarium was from ToT, Chaos is different from Octavarium. It is also much better than Octavarium. \n\nThis album topples Dead Reckoning by DT\u2019s progressive peers Threshold, which I had once given the top position of 2007 Prog albums. The true masters of progressive metal return triumphantly!\n\nThere is much less soloing in this album than the other Dream Theater LP\u2019s, which is a definite improvement after the solofest of Octavarium. More attention is given to the actual idea of the album, instead of to the technicality of the song, giving the record a much more completed sound. This album is epic. Not only do they fill up the entire album (78:44), but the songs themselves have build-up and climaxes that add to the majesty of the whole. Especially the sixteen minute closer, \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2: Heretic/The Slaughter of the Damned\u201d. An exceptional album closer. \n\nSystematic Chaos might just be DT\u2019s darkest affair. With songs like \u201cThe Dark Eternal Night\u201d and \u201cThe Ministry of Lost Souls\u201d, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to disagree. The lyrics, while sometimes needing a bit of tweaking, fit in perfectly with the songs. The lyrical subjects are always in the negative, a contrast with other Theater albums, where there are usually a couple positive sounding songs. This is a good thing, however, what with the dark moods created by the actual music. The several crushing riffs give rhythm to the songs, something that DT lacked before, especially on Octavarium. This is a definite return to Train of Thought, although, as every truly awesome band, this album progresses beyond what has been done before. \n\nI cannot choose a favourite track from this album. The standout songs are \u201cForsaken\u201d, \u201cConstant Motion\u201d, The Ministry of Lost Souls\u201d and \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies, Pt. 2: Heretic/The Slaughter of the Damned\u201d. I was a little disappointed in \u201cRepentance\u201d, the song that appears to be \u2018My Dying Soul\u201d (ToT) pt. II. Just not enough there, I guess. It dragged on and I found it to be boring. \u201cThe Ministry of Lost Souls\u201d is comparable to ToT\u2019s \u201cEndless Sacrifice\u201d. While nowhere near as good as the dynamic Sacrifice, Ministry still retains some of the majestic elements of its predecessor. Very cool lyrics in this song, as well. The second part of In the Presence of Enemies is an extremely good song, complete with cool lyrics, rising melodies, rhythmic verses and the typical trade of Petrucci: solos. If I had to pick a fave song, this would be it.\n\nOverall, this album has a very modern sound to it. The diminished soloing give it a better chance of being palatable to the more conventional masses. The production is good, nothing too special, but more than good enough. The vocals, sung by the seemingly unchanging LaBrie, are as well-done as ever, although a trifle annoying at times, but that\u2019s the same with every DT album, with the exception of the impeccable Train of Thought. But the true jewel of this album is the songwriting. Each song seems to flow and meander perfectly, like the caress of a lover. Seamless, this album is. But this beautiful songwriting is typical of Dream Theater, as can be seen most easily on the albums Images and Words, Metropolis\u2026, Train of Thought and now this one. I recommend it to one and all, but most especially to fans of Train of Thought. \n\n8.5/10\n",
        "\nMost reviews you will see for any Dream Theater album will come from one of two sets of people: the blind fanboys who would chop off their left testicle to come within 5 feet of John Myung, or the haters who would demand a 3rd testicle to go that near to one of the members of Dream Theater. I've already seen reviews of the band's latest opus, their debut on Roadrunner, and most of them call it a true successor to Awake, or what Train Of Thought wanted to be. Honestly I'm not the biggest DT fan out there, I can clearly see their flaws, but can also greatly appreciate their strengths. I'm not comparing this album to any other album by them, because I rarely have the same view on any two albums from the New Yorkers.\n\nIronically, the album starts with no bullshit (I say ironically because Dream Theater are arguably the least 'no bullshit' band on the planet) and quite a nice little descending lick followed by John Petrucci playing a riff drowned by effects, then a little while in they all start raping their instruments in the way we all love to see Dream Theater do. From there it doesn't really stop. Admittedly that isn't ALL they do (and it never has been), but often when they're taking it easy there's not much that really grabs your attention.\n\nMike Portnoy seems to have taken some more involvement in this album, not only playing about 5 drum kits in one, but also performing backing vocals and writing the lyrics for the next two movements of his ongoing Alcoholics Anonymous Suite. I'll go into depth about the last two factors later on, but his drumming is the most important duty he has in Dream Theater. He is consistent, as ever, but yet again I fail to be amazed by his technical skill. You can tell he has it, but he never uses it in a way which is either creative and musical, or just mindblowingly fast. His use of double bass drums is quite catchy (even though I've seen him using three...I don't get what that's about), and his (gorgeously produced) toms have some nice texture when used in heavier parts, but as with all his performances, his vast collection of cymbals (some the size of my fingernail) ruin it. Seriously, they just don't sound good, at all. I think it is just taste, as I've never liked the sound of small cymbals, but they just sound like they should ring longer than they do. Still, he can hold a riff down excellently (though I was doubting this in Prophets Of War) when he's not trying to show off his ability to play dotted rhythms (WOW!!!111!). Solid performance but the guy is quite overrated.\n\nWhen I was reading reviews for their 2005 effort Octavarium, I came across quite an interesting quote which I think is certainly applicable for Systematic Chaos. It is a reviewer (who gave Octavarium a 15% score) who was asking what parts of the epic title track of that album can redeem it's apparently low quality otherwise, and one of the things he said was \"Is it when Myung is heard for the first time since 1995?\". Honestly I laughed at that, and it sprang back to me while listening to Systematic Chaos. John Myung is a fantastic bassist, both technically and musically, but Portnoy and Petrucci (that album's producers) have kind of left him out. You can just about make out his basslines in the quieter parts, or during keyboard/guitar solos, but when there's a full power riff ploughing it's way through your speakers there's no distinction between John Petrucci's 7 string guitar and John Myung's 6 string bass. After his rather awesome performance on Octavarium (remember Panic Attack?) I was hoping to see more excellence from him this time around but only on Repentance did I really notice his existence behind the rest of the band.\n\nJohn Petrucci is now a well recognised shredder, among the likes of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai (partly due to the release of his first solo album, and his appearances on the G3 tour), but, as with Portnoy, I've never seen the massive appeal. There's no doubting his supreme technical ability, and anyone who's heard The Spirit Carries On would admit he can play solos with outstanding soul and conviction. Unfortunately, he normally prioritizes his first skill over the second, and for most of this album he is, well...all technique, no feeling. He has some nice melodies and chord choices in choruses, but when he needs to showcase himself (the solos), he becomes a guitar machine, and not in the good way. Mindless fretboard wanking is not how Steve Vai and Joe Satriani (who, funnily enough also make guest appearances on Repentance, but only on backing vocals) became famous. The only solos worth noting are on Repentance, In The Presence Of Enemies Pt. 2 (one of his better technical solos) and The Ministry Of Lost Souls (the first and second, the third sounds manky), in terms of quality. The Constant Motion solo is worth remembering in case you're ever asked what the worst solo ever is. Seriously, so many effects over some \"that's nice, dear\" scale runs. Greaaaat. His riffs, as usual, are pretty uninteresting but his performances on Repentance and The Ministry Of Lost Souls are definitely impressive.\n\nProgressive metal needs an epic factor, and Dream Theater's has been kept very high for a long time by Jordan Rudess. Most of the album has 2 or 3 tracks of overdubs, sometimes to back up guitar solos, sometimes as solos in their own right while a regular keyboard part plays underneath it. I still think he's the best member of Dream Theater, always plays with taste and impeccable timing, and his choice of tone is always perfect for the situation. While there aren't many (though there are LOADS in In The Presence Of Enemies Pt. 2) moments where you can say out loud \"wow, Jordan is a great player\" (see: These Walls), he's always consistent and if you want to just listen to what he's doing, you'll never get bored. It wouldn't be going far to say this is his best performance yet.\n\nVocals. A mixed bag if there ever was one. As I'm sure you all know by now, the vocals in Constant Motion are pathetic. James LaBrie is trying to sound like James Hetfield (adding an 'ay' sound to every other word) and Portnoy and Petrucci are together making something resembling M. Shadows. NOT something any Dream Theater fan looks for. Also, in Prophets Of War, and In The Presence Of Enemies, there are some shouts and chants which, while fitting the lyrics well, do not work too well in the music. Just like when LaBrie tries to rap (unfortunately it's happened again), when they try different approaches to vocals, it plain old doesn't work. He has a good operatic voice, and while he can sound quite irritating when hitting high notes, he puts a lot into his singing. There are times when he sounds simply awful (the aforementioned Constant Motion, and The Dark Eternal Night), and also times where he sounds commanding, and like a real frontman (In The Presence Of Enemies Pt. 2).\n\nOther than LaBrie, Petrucci and Portnoy, there are yet more backing vocal appearances from many famous musicians, such as Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Mikael Akerfeldt, Steven Wilson, Neal Morse, Corey Taylor and Chris Jericho (!), all on Repentance. While most of them do a good job, you wouldn't really notice that those voices were there without being notified of it beforehand. Also, I am very disappointed in Dream Theater for getting such wonderful people as Akerfeldt, Satch, Vai and Wilson to appear, but only give them backing vocal duties. I mean, Satriani and Vai! There should be some kind of law against them not playing a solo on a song they appear in.\n\nlyrically; I've never been too interested in Dream Theater. I notice they have some rather complex concepts and the story behind Scenes From A Memory is fascinating, but as with all new CD's I buy, I am always compelled to give the lyrics a look. All of the lyric writing is shared between Petrucci and Portnoy, aside from Prophets Of War which was penned by James LaBrie. When Mike Portnoy announced the tracklisting on the internet, pretty much everyone guessed that the music and lyrics would be heavier and darker, and they were certainly right in terms of lyrics. The common themes of faith and religion return, but with a more cynical twist on them. In The Presence Of Enemies seems to be talking about a loss of faith, or even the tyranny of religious authorities. I'm not one to judge what the lyricists were intending but that's what it's telling me. Forsaken is in a typical DT style, involving love and a woman, but with a more mysterious twist. Then, aside from Repentance (the new AA song from Portnoy about his alcoholism), the rest of the songs are about a mixture of war, politics and religion, with some more-than-regular darkness thrown in. I personally think that Mike Portnoy's lyrics are pretty weak, but Petrucci's written some very effective lyrics on Systematic Chaos (particularly The Dark Eternal Night and The Ministry Of Lost Souls).\n\nOverall the music is a tidy mixture of Octavarium, Train Of Thought and Awake, with the strengths and weaknesses of all those albums rolled up into one, but thankfully most of the less impressive aspects are contained on certain songs, so if you want to listen to just the highlights, you can just stick on a few tracks without having to sift through several movements to find the good bits. Summing up a work with such scope and variety is quite difficult to do, especially concisely (then again, this review is pretty damn long), but it's another step along the road for Dream Theater. It pales in comparison to Octavarium but it's mostly solid, and worth a purchase if you're an existing Dream Theater fan, but there are better places to start than Systematic Chaos.\n",
        "\nThere was some blowback incurred when DT released their 03' record Train of Thought, which showcased DT's heaviest musical manifestations from albums like Awake and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. I always thought the criticism was unwarranted; after all, heaviness has always been a central factor in DT's musical style. This is progressive metal, not progressive rock, Dream Theater, not Yes.\n\nRegardless, its no wonder DT elected to compose a more traditional prog record to commemorate their 20th anniversary; indeed Octavarium encompasses just about every component of what has made DT so exceptional over the years, with some really stellar songs and some not quite as remarkable. Each of the songs in my perception falls into a particular era in DT's discographic repetoir, as demonstrated below.\n\nIn terms of more thrash-oriented pieces, which I'll christen the \"Awake Epoch\" Octavarium serves up The Root of All Evil and Panic Attack, the former the third installment in Mike Portnoy's AA-themed epic and the latter a classic thrash jam with a really catchy riff and chorus. Both are in the vein of what we've come to expect from a DT headbanger, however admittedly it can be safely said most people will regard Root as the weakest song in the AA saga, due mainly to its simplicity relative to its predecessors. Its still a great song and an ideal opener, but doesn't quite meet the mark in comparison to The Glass Prison or This Dying Soul. \n\nNext lets take a look at the more pop-oriented songs on the album, which I have called the \"Falling Into Infinity Epoch\". If the name is any indication, these songs have been the primary nexus of criticism attributed to this record, suitably so since FII has undoubtably been traditionally the least favored DT album. Songs like The Answer Lies Within, I Walk Beside You, and Never Enough have been criticised for failing to meet the techinical virtuosity and pure prog nature of classical DT songs. \n\nIndeed these are highly radio-friendly DT songs, take them for what they're worth. Personally I like Answer, its a traditional ballad with uplifting lyrics and frankly I'm not seeing the big deal, a softer song like this appears on every DT record. I wouldn't rank it as high as Disappear but its still cool. The \"pop-prog\", Muse-esque Never Enough is also quite addicting IMO, the only real gripe I have here is I Walk Beside You. Come on, DT, this would be fine if it was U2 or Coldplay, but you guys definitely have higher standards, its not a catastrophic cacophony, its just not what we've come to expect from you.\n\nFinally we come to the pure-prog, \"Images and Words Epoch\", defined by more traditional prog songs These Walls, Sacrificed Sons, and the title track Octavarium. All three are spectacular, particularly the 24 minute magnum opus title track. If anyone is wary of buying this album due to the presence of more pop-esque songs, Octavarium alone makes a purchase worthwhile, surely this will be revered as one of DT's greatest songs of all time.\n\nThis is an all-encompassing tableau of proggressive metal at its finest. Certainly some songs are better than others, but with such intense range in style compressed into one album, this is to be expected, a great addition to any progressive afficianado's collection.\n",
        "\nHere we have Dream Theater\u2019s latest offering, their ninth studio album, and their first one on the Roadrunner record label. I\u2019ll be honest, when I cued up the album on winamp and pressed play, I had pretty low expectations. I loved Octavarium, contrary to many people (although my ridiculously long review of it was a little much); it showed that Dream Theater could exercise restraint with regards to songwriting and soloing, which was a much needed display after the excesses and indulgences that plagued Train of Thought. Unfortunately, the buzz for Systematic Chaos suggested that they were making Train of Thought 2, which immediately made me think of forced heaviness and meandering compositions. Then along came the singles. They were different, and I didn\u2019t know what to make of them. I took the easy way out. I convinced myself that this album was going to suck.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nRight after I pressed play, \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies Pt. 1\u201d pulled no punches and immediately gripped me, and assaulted my ears with a melodic riff accented by Jordan\u2019s synth keyboard sounds. The first five minutes are among the finest in Dream Theater\u2019s catalogue, with an emotional solo from John Petrucci. Splitting up this song and using this as an album opener was a brilliant move. It\u2019s a great way to get the listener\u2019s attention.\n\nThere is an energy to this album that hasn\u2019t been on a Dream Theater studio record in years. The enthusiasm is much like what is found on the live Score CD/DVD, when Dream Theater played at Radio City in NYC. These guys have always put their all into their work, but there is something youthful about this album that simply defies expectations. Above all, you can tell that they had fun creating this, which for a studio album is quite the accomplishment.\n\nOf course, this would be all for nothing if all the songs after \u201cIn The Presence of Enemies Pt. 1\u201d were terrible. Thankfully, they are not. There is a variety to the songs, yet they all share a darker tone that unites the album as a whole. \u201cForsaken\u201d and \u201cProphets of War\u201d are the more radio-friendly tunes, \u201cConstant Motion\u201d and \u201cThe Dark Eternal Night\u201d are the headbangers, \u201cRepentance\u201d continues the Alcoholics Anonymous suite (which now includes \u201cThe Glass Prison,\u201d \u201cThis Dying Soul,\u201d and \u201cThe Root of All Evil.\u201d Yes, they\u2019re all part of one long song, that\u2019s why riffs and lyrics are being reused) and \u201cThe Ministry of Lost Souls\u201d and \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies\u201d are the obligatory epics.\n\nBut didn\u2019t I say that the singles convinced me that the album was going to suck? Well, in a word, yes. However, \u201cConstant Motion\u201d now feels a lot more comfortable in the context of the album. It\u2019s still rip-off of AJFA-era Metallica at times, but the verse riff is simply fun and the second half of the song infuses the Dream Theater spirit into the track. As for \u201cThe Dark Eternal Night,\u201d that took some getting used to. It\u2019s definitely the heaviest Dream Theater song ever, beating out previous candidates \u201cThe Mirror\u201d and \u201cHonor Thy Father.\u201d It\u2019s also quite unlike anything done by them before. It\u2019s a grower, so try not to dismiss it outright simply due to it being an oddity. The second half of the song also showcases Rudess\u2019s abilities quite nicely.\n\nThe other songs are solid overall. \u201cForsaken\u201d is a wonderful follow-up to the opening track, beginning with a quiet piano passage, and blaring forth into an uplifting song with soaring vocals and a catchy rock-styled verse riff. \u201cRepentance\u201d sounds like something off of Opeth\u2019s Damnation album, right down to a synth used by Rudess near the 2:55 mark, and overall is a moving piece of music. \u201cProphets of War,\u201d which lyrically is about the invasion and occupation of Iraq, is the most \u201cupbeat\u201d and infectious of all the songs (ironically), and has a crowd shouting in the background during the chorus. \u201cThe Ministry of Lost Souls\u201d has a beautiful aesthetic quality to it, and \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies Pt. 2\u201d concludes the album with force and bombast, in true Dream Theater style.\n\nOf course, not everything is perfect here. Dream Theater continues to walk the fine line when it comes to wearing their influences on their sleeve. I\u2019ve already mentioned the Metallica riffs in \u201cConstant Motion\u201d and the Damnation-style synths and atmosphere of \u201cRepentance.\u201d In addition, \u201cProphets of War\u201d is unabashed worship of Absolution-era Muse, although this song is superior to the other Muse-styled song \u201cNever Enough.\u201d Also, a couple of the songs run long without enough ideas to warrant the extended play time. \u201cRepentance\u201d has a nearly 5-minute spoken section that, while important to the overall story within the AA suite, drags the song down as a stand-alone track as the music that backs the recorded confessions is completely forgettable. \u201cThe Ministry of Lost Souls\u201d is also an offender. It\u2019s a 15 minute piece, but the first seven minutes and the last three are basically the same pattern over and over again, and the five minute deviation in the middle isn\u2019t enough to sustain my interest, no matter how lovely the vocal patterns in the chorus are (of which they are quite beautiful). I don\u2019t see why this track is currently so highly regarded, as it\u2019s too slow-paced and ethereal to be an epic proper. Overall though, these are my only real complaints, and they\u2019re minor in the overall scheme of the album. And thankfully, instrumental wanking is not a part of the list. There are no Train of Thought excesses here.\n\nLyrically, Dream Theater has decided to change things up and try fantasy-themed writings. So here we have songs about dark lords, vampires, and everything else that power metal bands write about. It\u2019s an interesting change, and we get superbly cheesy lines like \u201cdark master within, I will fight for you!\u201d Of course, there are the standard introspective lyrics too, although those have a darker slant to them as well.\n\nThe band members themselves are in top form here. Petrucci is the centerpiece of this record, with rocking riffs and tasteful solos aplenty. This is one of the strongest offerings from this man since the masterpiece known as Awake, which is quite the accomplishment. Rudess also impresses here, as I feel he\u2019s finally come into his own. He showed his more mature side on Octavarium, and it continues here, along with some ragtime fun in \u201cThe Dark Eternal Night.\u201d Portnoy does some interesting things on this album, such as the machine-like bass-hits in \u201cThe Dark Eternal Night\u201d and his vocal contributions to that song and \u201cConstant Motion.\u201d Myung is still in the background, and lends more support to the tone of the songs than a superficial listen would suggest. Happily, he is a lot easier to detect in this album. Finally, we have LaBrie. As most know, he suffered a vocal chord rupture from food poisoning after Awake was recorded. With the release of Octavarium, he was near full recovery, as the impressive vocal melodies demonstrated. Score proved that his recovery was complete, for both studio and live settings. That tradition continues on Systematic Chaos. Although the vocal patterns aren\u2019t as high or complex as those on some previous records, his voice is clear and confident. Keep your ear open during \u201cForsaken,\u201d \u201cProphets of War,\u201d \u201cThe Ministry of Lost Souls,\u201d and \u201cIn the Presence of Enemies\u201d for some strong vocal goodness from this Canadian frontman.\n\nAs for the production, this is the best I\u2019ve heard from a Dream Theater studio album, period. Their move to Roadrunner has afforded them better equipment. Everything is clear, and each instrument has its own space to breathe and develop. The distortion on the guitars and Rudess\u2019 keyboard patches are top notch. Everything sounds slick, but nothing is overproduced. I can\u2019t wait to get the special edition DVD-Audio and listen to the 5.1 mix, which will no doubt be amazing.\n\nThis album is a focused effort. For it being a nearly 80 minute album, the tracks simply fly by. Also, upon multiple listens, I\u2019ve come to realize another point about this album, which was a welcome revelation. It\u2019s the spiritual successor to Awake, just like Octavarium before it was a kindred spirit to Falling Into Infinity. It\u2019s got the same slick, aggressive production style, a gritty-sounding James LaBrie complemented by solid riff-work from Petrucci, and a darker tone mixed with a youthful maturity. Time will tell if Systematic Chaos has the same lasting appeal that Awake has, but the early outlook is good.\n\nOverall, this is a solid album by a well-established band. Dream Theater still has plenty of ideas left. If Systematic Chaos is any indicator, we can expect to hear more music from them for many years to come.\n\nScores\nMusic (60%): 92/100\nAlbum Cohesiveness (20%): 93/100\nProduction (15%): 100/100\nReplayability (5%): 90/100\n\nOverall (Weighted): 93/100\n",
        "\nLike many, of course, I bought Octavarium right after its release - the hype, the hope. Four or five listens later, it was condemned to gathering dust next to Chaos AD and the odd Machine Head, except for just once to write this review. I'll not listen again, thanks.\n\nBecause Octavarium is to Images And Words what St. Anger is to Kill 'Em All. Gone is the curious When Dream And Day Unite soundscape, the catchy Awake phrases, the poppy Falling Into Infinity tunes, or the heavy Train Of Thought riffage. Sure, Dream Theater has seen many incarnations, has explored probably too many musical territories than might have fitted in two decades, and has consistently pleased and disappointed fans all alike all over the globe in their search for more, yet this one effort is just way too far off the mark. I was planning to be polite about it and keep my disgust for myself, but looking in hindsight, this album is simply not acceptable from one of the most ambitious bands in the progressive quarter.\n\nOctavarium is, like said, nothing less than utter nonsense; a collection of absolutely bad songs that, while putting up all kinds of links to earlier work and to other artists (the choice of which - U2, Linkin Park, Muse, Oasis - evoke a nicely frowning \"WTF??\"), fail to make any link with the listener at all. Perhaps nice to write, play, and record, but absolutely UNFIT for release. As a matter of fact, the score I had in mind for this started at 50% at the beginning of my re-listening, decreasing steadily in chunks of 5, ending right there at a staggering 15. There's a reason, folks. That reason is everywhere: in the music, even apart from the countless rip-offs which other reviewers have paid enough ample attention to, and in the lyrics - there was a time Petrucci wrote gems such as \"Scarred\" and Portnoy wrote \"A Change Of Seasons\"... long ago.\n\nIs there \u00c3\u00bcberhaupt anything positive to say about it? Sure, the production is nigh impeccable according to modern standards. Doesn't help much when one doesn't like modern standards, though. Musicianship is the same as yesterday, too: top-notch according to Dream Theater standards. There were times, however, when Petrucci could actually write music and lyrics, Portnoy managed to sound new and creative, and Labrie sounded fresh. The others need no mention, me thinks; both Rudess and Myung are some of the most overrated musicians in the progressive scene, though I haven't heard any of their works outside of Dream Theater - not planning to, either. On here, they sound bland and uninspired all five alike; technically infallible, otherwise nonsensical.\n\nLet's have a look at the music itself then - nothing to redeem here?\n\n\"The Root Of All Evil\" takes one minute to take off - an omen of the band's pointless bickering on the album (hey wait, it's been that way on the previous three albums too, right? Right). Then we jump into the worst opening riff in the band's history (remember \"Pull Me Under\", Petrucci? Apparently not), which somehow sets the tone for the coming 75 minutes of tedium. Secondly, I HATE effects on vocals - another symptom of lack of actual content. I think we got it here - Dream Theater sounds musically bankrupt. At the chorus I thought it might actually begin from then onwards, but it's just a faint image of what once was. \"Take The Time\", this not. Problem is, this is the best song of the album!!\n\nTracks 2, 3, and 4 are vivid enough in my memory to know that they do not deserve another listen, so we skip to \"Panick Attack\". After one minute I find myself wondering why not skip further, but in the interest of this review, we're not doing that. After all, that's why I'm listening to this rubbish again. Now for the song, I've never been a fan of Petrucci switching to 7-string - hence why I consider Images And Words better than Awake. This, however, makes \"The Mirror\" sound like \"The Sinner\", and in an attempt to avoid a looming headache, is excused from further duty after four minutes. After all, I know that the coming solos and harmonies do absolutely nothing to redeem this song: they're a further expansion of the principle adhered to since Scenes From A Memory: \"more notes is better, even if they suck grandma's balls!\"\n\n\"Never Enough\" is expelled from the system in much the same way, shortly after LaBrie starts the Muse-style singing. There are a bad ideas, and then there are also very bad ideas. The worst category of all, however, are very bad ideas lasting over ten minutes - check the last half of the album for an example of that. Someone please tell me what the first four minutes of the title track are meant to do? Atmosphere or what? Sure the Billboard top 40 is full of atmospheric songs, too, right?? Now I don't mind pieces of \"sound\" opening up long, epic songs or albums, or minutes of silence stretching between minutes of brilliant music or awe-inspiring stuff, but I'm afraid Dream Theater is not in that town today.\n\nLet's fast forward through this 24-minute monster to explore where the gems of this album are supposed to be hidden. Is it the acoustic intro? Negative. Is it when Myung is heard for the first time since 1995? Negative. Is it in the Rudess lead break at 12:20? Negative - you'll never match Kevin Moore, dude. Is it perhaps the certainly very smart and intertextual lyrics? Not unless I'm missing some major point here, no. Yes, I got the references. No they're not impressive or smart, least of all any productive. Is it in the instrumental section from 15:40 onwards? Unless you haven't heard \"The Dance Of Eternity\" (and assuming you actually enjoy that nonsense!), no. Is it the surprising five-second acoustic Petrucci interlude? Er, I'm afraid it is, yes. That's right, folks, five seconds of acoustic guitar by the marvellous John Petrucci is all you need to hear from the fucking 75 minutes!! Guess it's time to record an unplugged album or so, guys. Oh wait, you've already done that (see the Acoustic Dreams bootleg, which is nothing stellar except for having Bruce Dickinson on it). Dismissed!!\n\nHow one can make an album like this with such capabilities in one's veins is utterly beyond me. Hanging this disc above your garden pond and watching the prism colours over the water is much more interesting than actually listening to it.\n",
        "\nThis is the first single from Dream Theater's new album, from what I've heard from it, if all this album gonna be like that, it will be their heaviest album ever. For the nostalgic fans which looking for another 'Images And Words', you'll be heavily disappointed because this song sounds extremely different from that one. These of you who just looking for good music and don't care if the band returns to their roots or not, you'll may like it as I did.\n\nFirst of all, the band again changed their sound. If there is something that I like the most with 'Dream Theater', is that each time they making something new and don't hesitate with surfing into different music styles. This is sounds a bit like 'Metallica', you can feel it especially within Labrie's vocals which sounds pretty aggressive here and reminds Hetfield's style quite much. The riffing is also more piercing and straightforward, but it still remains catchy and technical as their usual riffs. However, this song lacks a lot with keyboards. In 'Scenes From A Memory' for instance, the keyboards were pretty dominant and had a lot of leading work with the guitar. Here it only makes some choirs a bit and doesn't really sounds special or brings something deep within the song.\n\nThe song begins with Petrucci's technical riffing which is pretty progressive and heavy, then the drums comes in and not much later there is a small break which leading to the first verse. Petrucci continues with his riffing and then Labrie joins with a pretty straightforward and biting singing, the bridge later is a bit more mid paced and then it repeat the verse and continues to the chorus. The chorus is extremely catchy and manages to keep on heavy sense, though it sounds a bit mainstreamed, it works pretty well. The lead break later is also pretty impressive, Petrucci shows us again his abilities with some cool shredding solos. The keyboard's soloing is also works pretty well, it has an excellent vibe and sounds right in the place.\n\nIn conclusion, as a single it works perfect. It's a catchy and sprightly song which also makes you headbang here and there (maybe the first time I headbanged while listening to 'Dream Theater!) and really stuck in your mind for a while.\nHowever, I can't tell how the album gonna sounds, as this is only a single and singles are mostly created only to increase the sales amount of the album. I hope this is a unique song within this album because I don't know how the band can create a whole album which sounds similar like this song, without making it sounds repetitive and even dull sometimes. Hopefully this is really just a single and not a sign of what to come, let's wait for the new album and see if 'Dream Theater' did it again, and excelled their former album which was a truly masterpiece.\n",
        "\nI'm a cheap bastard when it comes to buying something i don't NEED, but i bought this DVD once for a good deal, then some jerk-off stoal it from me after i was passed out drunk from my house after watching it with me. I ended up reaching up my tight ass again to buy this, and i don't regret it (just the asshole that steals from me). \n\n\nIt was great to be able to see these guys transform over roughly a 7-year period. You could get quite a feel of the mood that the band was going through. Instead of pretending that they're God's gift to music, you can see that they're humbled from they're overwhelming success of \"Pull Me Under\" to the critically unacclaimed \"Falling Into Infinity.\" I had always heard that \"Falling Into Infinity\" was a terrible album, so there was no reason for me to search for it. After I saw the \"Touring Into Infinity\" clips, I saw how this \"shitty\" music could still be exciting if you look at it in the right point of view. I really got into the live French clips off the \"Falling Into Infinity\" songs. A real musician can pull that off while numerous other bands would squander and be broken beyond ever fixing.\n\n\nIt's easy to see how Dream Theater has had an easy run of things, but like every other band out there they had to roll the dice, too. Dream Theater created what I thought to be their best album \"Awake,\" and on the DVD I felt bad for them that their record label treated the album as a disaster, because they didn't get to line their pockets as much as they'd like. \n\n\nThe best part of these DVD's to me is the insight to how these guys are just regular guys like the ones who write these reviews, except that they practice their instruments on a sickeningly high basis. I loved the 3 or 4 second shot of Vinnie Paul of Pantera, Paul Bostaph then Slayer, and Mike Portnoy standing together in Greece. I also get a feeling that America is far too stupid to hold a sold-out Dream Theater concert, probably because of poeple like the \"true-metal\" idealist that wrote all the reviews for \"Train of Thought.\" There are concert clips from France, Greece, and Japan, so that's quite an insight to Dream Theater's fan base in the pre-Metropolis days. \n\n\nThe live songs themselves are pretty amazing themselves. They're nowhere near the video or audio clarity of their \"Live at the Budokon\" or \"Score,\" but I think I like it better this way. It's cool to look at these guys with a bit of unprofessionalism for once. I get more of a connectiont to the music of this DVD, because of the roughness of the production. \n\n\nThe \"Images and Words:Live in Tokyo\" concert was pretty much flawless, with the exception of a couple instances where James really pushed the envelope trying to hit very high and very long notes. The jamming is what impreses me the most. We all know these guys can play tight shit when they practice the same shit over and over together. We all know how great musicians jamming with other great musicians can be lifeless, boring, and pointless, but these guys REALLY have a feel for eachother in this DVD unlike anyone I've ever heard. You know they're pulling some of this shit out of their ass as they go along, and they're tight as you can be. \n\n\nThe \"Ytse Jam/drum solo\" is great. It is already a classic prog instrumental, then mixed in with a near 10-minute drum solo where a young Mike shows his love of Pantera with John Petrucci playing a \"By Demons be Driven\" riff, where Mike continues to go on a hailfire of long, fast, progressive fills that would have even the black metal community perking their ears (Mike doesn't use triggers either!). He comes to an almost standstill, sort of teasing the audience with cymbal rakes and a latin-jazzy groove, bouncing back to a double-bass fill, until it builds up speed into a noticeable insanity of Mike Portnoy. I've played alot and watched a lot of solos, but this is the best one I've ever seen. Fuck Tommy Lee.\n\n\nIf you enjoy watching amazing musicians, and aren't threatened by them, or too ignorant to appreciate what you don't understand then get this DVD. It's a hell of a deal. I bought it twice. Hopefully not a 3rd though.\n",
        "\nOver the last couple of years it\u2019s fair to say that Dream Theater have become one of my all time favourite bands. Out of their 8 albums I adore 6, with Awake and Falling into Infinity being the only exceptions, and even they have their moments. I\u2019ve also always enjoyed their live work, having seen \u2018Live at Budokan\u2019 and owning \u2018Scenes from New York.\u2019 So when I heard that they were releasing another DVD of their 20th anniversary tour finale, highlighting their entire career, I was always going to buy it at some point. Then of course I heard that some of the show was being played with the Octavarium orchestra, naturally I now intended to buy it as soon as it came out. \n\nWell, firstly I have to say, the packaging looks awesome. Mike Portnoy designed it I believe, he\u2019s a truly multi-talented guy. It\u2019s eye catching indeed. There is no booklet to coincide with the actual DVD, just advertising one. However that matters little as the back of the cover features as many live photos of the band as you could possibly need. Overall, nicely packaged. \n\nThe DVD kicks off with a couple of tracks off \u201cOctavarium\u201d in the shape of The Root of All Evil and I Walk Beside You. These songs really work better live I feel, (perhaps it\u2019s hearing them without the sub-par album production). Early on, you feel that LaBrie is on top form vocally and has a real aura about him. \n\nThis was a concert spanning their entire career so they then started playing songs in chronological order. From songs from the Majesty days like \u201cAnother Won\u201d to classics like \u201cUnder a Glass Moon\u201d they ripped through the set. They were all on top form, especially as I mentioned earlier LaBrie who was almost flawless. They finished the set with a moving performance of \u201cThe Spirit Carries On\u201d and that was the end of part one of the concert. The highlight so far being LaBrie getting a chance to sing songs like \u201cAfterlife\u201d that were of course originally sung by Charles Dominici.\n\nBut it was now that the fun part began, as the Orchestra made their way out. We\u2019ve heard bands like Metallica, Kiss and Scorpions play with orchestra\u2019s, now it was Dream Theater\u2019s turn\u2026 and what better song to open with for an orchestra than Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. The band often paly snippets of the song live but this was a rare opportunity to hear the whole 45minutes + played live and with an orchestra to boot. One thing I noticed throughout this song and the rest of the concert in fairness is that the orchestra didn\u2019t make as much of a difference as I expected. With bands I mentioned previously, it totally changed how certain songs sounded, however on this occasion (probably due to the fact that DT use more orchestration than the other band) the songs weren\u2019t altered dramatically. However, the orchestra provided a subtle touch and extra edge to the ambience, they went so well with the band that they didn\u2019t alter the sound as much as they might have. \n\nThey skip through tracks like \u201cVacant\u201d (a chance for LaBrie to show us just how well he was singing) and \u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d and then we were back with Octavarium. (While it was a career-spanning concert, this was still the main focus) One of the real highlights was \u201cSacrificed Sons\u201d which sounded awesome with the orchestra as well and with LaBrie on such good form. After \u201cOctavarium\u201d the band went off but came back for one more encore, their classic \u201cMetropolis\u201d leaving the crowd in attendance and folk like me watching the DVD very happy. \n\nTheir performance of every song was as ever verging on flawless. They truly are incredible musicians and LaBrie proved this night that he is a great singer himself. My only slight problem was with the song selection. Overall it was good, no doubt, but it was missing some more punch. It may have benefited from another song off \u201cTrain of Thought\u201d to add a bit of impact, it wasn\u2019t the heaviest set they\u2019ve ever done.\nHowever, all in all it was an awesome live performance. \n\nNow it\u2019s always a good sign when there is a whole new disco for extras, and the extras don\u2019t come any better than this. There is the usual tomfoolery of artwork and the like, but here we have a couple of extra live tracks and most importantly, the main attraction the hour-long documentary. Now, often documentaries are too short and whip quickly through a band\u2019s career, but DT have never been one\u2019s to cut things short. The documentary charts the band\u2019s career, from how they met and formed in Music College to their recent success. With each member of the band (as well as a couple of past members) adding their two cents this documentary and the extras themselves prove to be a winner. \n\nSo, overall this was a seriously good DVD package. The packaging is good, there are genuinely worthwhile extras and of course, the concert performance is brilliant as always. In fact, it was a particularly good show and this is a particularly good DVD release, and by Dream Theater standards that truly is saying something.\n",
        "\nEvery once in a while, a band comes along that redefines their genre. Be it through sheer innovation, unbridled passion, or unbounded technical skill, they manage to set a precedent by which all future bands are compared. In the case of progressive metal prodigies Dream Theater, they present all of the above, paying homage to their influences and expanding that influence beyond comprehension. And this is just their debut album (and far short of their best work).\n\nWhen Dream and Day Unite had to grow on me. This was an unfortunate byproduct of my adoration of their later releases, which this album sounds quite detached from. Dream Theater's first album is their only with vocalist Charlie Dominici and has a far less refined production than every album that comes after it. Those two factors add to the most apparent observation about this album; that is, that it sounds like Rush. But it's a much heavier and, dare I say, an even more technical Rush if at all. I'll discuss that further later on.\n\nOne thing that is certainly undeniable about this album is the raw talent of the band members. Even on their debut, Dream Theater is leaps and bounds ahead of everybody else out recording albums in 1989. John Petrucci is unbelievable, showcasing a much more metal side to his playing than on later albums. His shredding prowess is mighty: the solo section on the album's first track, \"A Fortune in Lies,\" features a magnificent tap arrangement, tasteful sweep picking, and a furious pairing of mastery and melody. He plays with as much emotion as bravado and is equally skilled at writing heavy riffs as he is at clean ones. John Myung is a fantastic bassist, probably one of the bests. His playing is fast and articulate. To say Mike Portnoy's rhythms are intricate would be a vast understatement. Years before he was universally declared one of the bests in the business, he was giving Neal Peart a run for his money, shifting between dynamic time signatures like he invented them. Kevin Moore is a top-shelf keyboard player, balancing atmosphere and technical fury with a sense of restraint that's very uncommon amongst progressive keyboardists. The only thing that usually turns people off, especially fans of later Dream Theater, is the singer, usually just because he's not James. Dominici has a very Geddy Lee-like voice (pretty much the single greatest reason this sounds like Rush in their prime) that isn't far inferior to LaBrie (or Lee for that matter) and his melody lines for the lyrics range from impressive to inspiring. I'm not going to discuss the lyrics, as hells_unicorn has already provided way more insight into them than I ever could, but I'll say that they're very good, despite being less personal than some of the more introspective passages on their later works.\n\nWhile the band members have yet to reach their musical peak on this release, their sense of songwriting is already fully matured. Complex arrangements, technical showmanship without losing melody or catchiness, epic movements and atmosphere. All of these are present in full glory. Every song is a masterpiece in its own right, with my only complaint being against the slighty too-extended intro to \"The Ones Who Help to Set the Sun.\" I can harbor no other complaints against any part of this album, even the production, which is sub-par in comparison to their later works, displays immense charm after just a few listens.\n\nThis is one of progressive metal's most unheralded, yet quite deserving masterpieces, the glorious union of 80's metal and 70's progressive rock. I can't think of anyone to whom this cannot be recommended. Even if it takes a listen or two, the majesty of this album is undeniable.\n",
        "\nThe end of the 80s was a period of intense realignment within the metal community. Like the progressive rock acts of the 1970s, their work was defined by growth rather than the stagnation of the punk rock scene that they drew some of their more aggressive influences from. Bands such as Queensryche and Fates Warning were riding high with a series of solid releases, inspired by the dark music of Black Sabbath and the later NWOBHM, as well as the intellectualism of Rush. It is primarily from this grain of the metal genre that Dream Theater came into being, a band which managed to both survive and prosper in the aftermath of Metal\u2019s fall from the mainstream a few years later.\n\nLike all progressive bands, Dream Theater\u2019s most innovative work did not occur on their debut, but what was done on the debut set the tone for the remainder of their career. They have always carried the introspective and philosophical aspects of Rush\u2019s music, as well as their tendency towards complex song structures and blazing technical displays. The heavier part of their music screams out a large amount of influence from Fates Warning, particularly the later work done with John Arch such as \u201cAwaken the Guardian\u201d. \n\nThe lyrical content of \u201cWhen Dream and Day Unite\u201d touches upon a variety of differing experiences and original stories drawing out questions of society, introspection, and even metaphysics. From the sort of unconventional self-realization encountered on \u201cFortune in Lies\u201d, a song telling the story of an acquaintance of the band who spent time in prison, to the self-irony of \u201cStatus Seeker\u201d, seeing the band writing a commercially friendlier song that pokes fun at itself, the band has this sort of heightened awareness to their sound that matches the words. \u201cLight Fuse and Get Away\u201d and \u201cThe Ones Who Help to Set the Sun\u201d are thematically a bit less obvious subject wise, though they continue the tradition of bending the boundaries of metal music. \n\nThe music on here is highly technical, but successfully balances out the virtuoso sections with catchy melodic sections. \u201cFortune in Lies\u201d, \u201cStatus Seeker\u201d \u201cAfterlife\u201d and \u201cOnly a Matter of Time\u201d are the most memorable in the bunch. Although they all have quite drawn out intros and some sizable changes in feel, they still manage to function primarily as listener friendly songs with well defined sections. \u201cThe Killing Hand\u201d showcases the Rush influences, and reminds me a bit of the \u201c2112\u201d song cycle, while lyrically presenting one of the most bizarre stories heard. \u201cThe Ytse Jam\u201d is among the more well-known instrumentals put out by this band, and draws a bit from Rush\u2019s famous instrumental \u201cYYZ\u201d. \u201cThe Ones Who Help to Set the Sun\u201d and \u201cLight Fuse and Get Away\u201d contain some impressive keyboard and guitar work, the former containing my favorite John Petrucci solo on this release.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of this album is that vocalist Charles Domenici does not appear again in subsequent Dream Theater releases, and this tends to marginalize this release from the rest of the band\u2019s back catalog. His voice is very similar to Geddy Lee\u2019s, although clearly lacking some of the quasi-feminine quirks that he has at times. All in all, he is a good singer and it is a bit of a shame that he waited more than 15 years before resurfacing, and ultimately challenging his former band\u2019s status as the throne holders of the progressive metal style. But this is a solid progressive release that came into being very early in the genre\u2019s evolution. It still carries some remnants of the 80s, particularly in the presentation of the keyboard work. Fans of Fates Warning and mid-80s Queensryche will probably enjoy this one, although this particular release will probably appeal more to fans of Rush\u2019s 80\u2019s music. I still listen to it every few months and after owning it for 8 years and it hasn\u2019t lost any of its freshness or intrigue.\n\nLater submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on October 9, 2008.\n",
        "\n\u2026and this is what they come up with? \n\nAllow me to be blunt \u2013 I hate this album. I don\u2019t hate it because it\u2019s a bad album; I hate it because it\u2019s a completely generic and blatantly derivative recording. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t hate it so much if it had been released by some other band, but for a band of such caliber (and even more, for a band hailed as the gods of \u201cprogressive\u201d metal), it\u2019s disappointing and downright saddening.\n\nBefore getting into the depressing details, I\u2019d like to briefly mention a thing or two about Train of Thought, which I feel holds some relevance to this review because it is Dream Theater\u2019s other major love/hate album. While Train of Thought was a severe departure from the majority of what DT had done prior, it was still interesting music. It was full of mind-boggling instrumental passages, creative rhythms, tasteful unisons, exceptional drumming, and basically a lot of everything that makes you stop and say, \u2018Wow!\u201d.\n\nEnter Octavarium \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s DT! No, it\u2019s U2! No, it\u2019s Muse! No, it\u2019s the Flower Kings! No, uh\u2026\u201d\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t mind a band paying respects to their influences in the music they create, but Octavarium enters the realm of influences-worn-on-your-sleeve in a way never before witnessed on a DT album. The chorus in \u201cI Walk Beside You\u201d is ripped straight from an unreleased U2 album. The entirety of the title track is like an extended jam between Pink Floyd and the Flower Kings\u2026 which is cool, except that if I wanted to listen to either of those bands, I\u2019d go listen to those bands. Then there\u2019s \u201cNever Enough\u201d, a song which I believe has had enough said about it already, so I\u2019ll just make a small contribution and say that the guys in DT should have just put a memo in the liner notes stating the following \u2013 \u201cWell guys, we couldn\u2019t come up with a sufficiently original eighth song for the album, so we decided to cover Muse\u2019s \u201cStockholm Syndrome\u201d and throw a few guitar solos in there for some added flavor! Enjoy!\u201d\n\nThanks guys.\n\nMoving on to the lyrics \u2013 when did Dream Theater turn emo? As if the mindless chatter of \u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d wasn\u2019t enough, you\u2019re then treated to Mike Portnoy bitching about ungrateful fans. What would I say if you walked away? I would probably say a whole lot of nothing and listen to Pain of Salvation instead. Even \u201cSacrificed Sons\u201d, which is one of the only decent tracks on the entire disc, is filled to the brim with inane and trite lyrics. Apparently John Petrucci wrote most of the lyrics on Octavarium, and while I respect his efforts, I sincerely think he should stick to his guitar. \n\nSpeaking of Petrucci, there\u2019s a decisive lack of him on this album. His playing is a major part of what has made post-Awake Dream Theater so interesting for me, and here he has resigned himself to writing poppy and generic melodies. Prime example is the central melody in \u201cPanic Attack\u201d, which makes me want to violently smash my face into a wall\u2026 how many times and by how many bands has that progression now been used? How about the melodies in \u201cThese Walls\u201d? Cut that song down by a few minutes and you have the quintessential radio single. Then there are the uninspired solos. In fact, there are really only two solos on this entire disc that I consider to be worthwhile \u2013 \u201cSacrificed Sons\u201d and \u201cOctavarium\u201d. Petrucci isn\u2019t the only one who was having feelings of restraint while writing Octavarium, though. Mike Portnoy has also apparently chosen to abandon everything that makes progressive metal drumming so exciting, opting instead to craft fairly straightforward and completely uninteresting rhythms. That was a huge disappointment to me especially, because one of my favorite things to listen to in progressive metal (and metal in general) is the extraordinary manipulation of rhythm and time by the drummer.\n\nThe songwriting took a huge hit, as well. Remember the intricate harmonies on Awake? The tremendous unisons on Scenes From A Memory? The extended instrumental interludes on Train of Thought? Sorry. Gone. Swapped out for a kinder, gentler, more appealing Dream Theater.\n\nThe only saving grace for this album, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is the title track. It\u2019s quite excellent, and does a great job of showcasing just what the guys are capable of. From the extended intro that reminds me heavily of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cShine On You Crazy Diamond\u201d, to the tasty melodies and grooves that make up the path to Petrucci\u2019s wonderful solo medley, and on to the inevitably powerful climax\u2026 it\u2019s quality prog without a second wasted. This is the kind of material that, in my opinion, would have been the next logical step for Dream Theater to take. Unfortunately, they chose to fill the remainder of the album with uninspired pop tracks like \u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d and generic wannabe metal like \u201cPanic Attack\u201d.\n\n\u201cSacrificed Sons\u201d is another great track, musically. Unfortunately, it is plagued by horrible lyrics. \n\nAs for the concept around Octavarium \u2013 I\u2019ve read all about it, and while it\u2019s interesting and sort of impressive, it does not excuse the pathetic music surrounding it.\n\nA few final thoughts \u2013 \n\nA lot of my hatred towards Octavarium comes from putting the album next to other recent albums from other bands, and next to DT\u2019s own past albums. It\u2019s vital that you do not misinterpret what I\u2019m trying to say here. I was NOT expecting an album that sounds just like Awake, or SFAM, or any other album that they have put out in the past. Nor was I expecting an utter progressive masterpiece to rival the likes of Cynic\u2019s \u201cFocus\u201d or Pain of Salvation\u2019s \u201cThe Perfect Element I\u201d.\n\nSo what was I expecting? A recording with a level of quality that\u2019s consistent with what the band is capable of. I don\u2019t care if it actually sounds like anything that DT has released in the past\u2026 so all the people that like to say, \u201cYou don\u2019t like Octavarium because it\u2019s different!\u201d \u2013 no, that is absolutely not why I don\u2019t like Octavarium. I was expecting them to do something new (like they always do), but I was also expecting them to do it in classic DT style and with classic DT prowess (like they always have). In other words - as long as the album is done with the creativity, mastery, innovation, and originality that Dream Theater are capable of, I don\u2019t give a crap what it sounds like. \n\nWhat I got was none of those things. \n\nI also don\u2019t buy all the garbage about \u201cgetting\u201d an album. Certain past DT albums needed an adjustment period because the content on those albums was different, yet still interesting and innovative. Octavarium, however, is full of recycled music\u2026 there\u2019s nothing to \u201cget\u201d. Though regardless, I don\u2019t believe any amount of time will help me get the lack of originality, mediocre songwriting, pathetic lyrics, recycled melodies, and pop sensibility that is thoroughly prevalent throughout this disc.\n\nBiggest disappointment of the year.\n",
        "\nThis DVD is an official bootleg of a live performance commemorating 15 years since the release of Dream Theater\u2019s debut album \u2018When Dream and Day Unite\u2019 (1989). The main feature of this DVD shoots the second half of a show where the band plays the album in its entirety followed by the encore songs \u2018To Live Forever\u2019 (non album track) and \u2018Metropolis Part 1\u2019 (Images and Words). These last two songs are performed with James LaBrie and the original Dream Theater singer, Charlie Dominici, trading lyrics. Metropolis welcomes to the stage second keyboardist, Derek Sherinian, to make it a real party atmosphere! Yes there are now seven musicians on stage!\n\nThis DVD is by no means a must buy. I would say this release is essential to Dream Theater fans, worth borrowing off a friend for causal DT listeners and passable to not worth it for everybody else. The concert itself is not spectacular. The sound quality is much improved from the original bad production. However, James LaBrie is far from perfect and in fact struggles his way through much of this material. The rest of the band looks nonplussed during the concert and the crowd is barely audible. This being Dream Theater\u2019s most obscure album I think many fans were not familiar with the material. After seeing the 2006 Dream Theater DVD \u2018Score\u2019 which has a near to perfect performance from LaBrie, great audience participation and relaxed band members that look like they are having fun, this release cannot compare in any way.\n\nWhere this DVD does gain extra marks is from the Special Features. There are a lot of extras on this DVD and for these alone it is worth a watch. The feature length commentary is enlightening. John Myung actually talks quite a lot \u2013 something I am sure many Dream Theater fans will find interesting. There is a lengthy documentary that shows all ten songs being performed live back in the days with the original line up (with terrible sound and picture quality and generally poor vocals from Dominici). As well as this, something I found exceedingly interesting was a discussion of all the songs on their debut album. There is footage of the original line up discussing the meaning behind the songs and how and why they composed/wrote them. There is also footage of the backstage warm up to the current concert which shows James LaBrie being friendly and helping Charlie Dominici.\n\nThis is an interesting look at the history of Dream Theater. It is not a DVD that will get played a great deal, but one that can be watched and appreciated every now and then. This is mainly due to the performance of the album itself. The performance is not bad, but it is nothing special visually. This means that with the corresponding CD release there is little reason to play the main feature of the DVD. All that is really left on the DVD are the special features. So basically, it depends what you really want. If you are a die hard fan then you should buy the DVD and CD. Both have different things to offer. I personally think this DVD release is a nice addition to the Dream Theater collection. It is an updated version of an underrated album that now features DT\u2019s current vocalist. The guest appearances and the special features are nice touches that make this release worthwhile and interesting for the Dream Theater fan.\n",
        "\nThis album is a masterpiece. There I have said it. However, I am sure that not everyone will agree with this statement. There are many people that dislike Dream Theater because of the band\u2019s long songs and often perceived \u2018music wankery\u2019. The band is well known for composing very complex progressive metal and this album is no exception. If anything, this album is more complex, as it is a full blown concept album of 77 minutes. So if you are a known Dream Theater hater then it is probably better that you read no further. To the people new to Dream Theater or this album, read on.\n\nIn Metropolis Part 2 everything comes together beautifully for the band. This album is a real mixed bag where Dream Theater pulls out all their tricks. There are complex and simpler songs depending on the mood or lyrical content. The music is varied between: the progressive; the metal; and the melodic elements. The concept is thought provoking and complex and is perfectly complimented by the lyrics written mostly by Petrucci and Portony. The musicianship is of course stellar as always. The recruitment of new keyboardist, Jordan Rudess, adds another element of virtuosity to this already accomplished band. \n\nThis is an album that will take a few listens to understand the concept and the twists and turns in the story. But, unlike many other Dream Theater albums, the music, although complex, is mostly accessible from the first listen. The obvious exception here is the Dance of Eternity, the instrumental track that boasts over 120 time signature changes in six minutes. This is probably the only weak track on the album as it does nothing to propel the story forward and the music feels somewhat artificial.\n\nWithout spoiling the story, which is very intricate when connecting it to Metropolis Part 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper from their 1992 album Images and Words, the lyrical themes that run through this album include: life after death (reincarnation); love; lust; and deception. The music compliments these themes on all levels. Songs such as Through Her Eyes and The Spirit Carries On are beautiful and uplifting whereas songs such as Fatal Tragedy and Finally Free and dark and brooding. Some of the longer songs such as Beyond this Life and Home push the story forward and leave room to show off DTs virtuosic and compositional skills. \n\nThis is an album that deserves the attention of music fans of all genres. The metal is not as prominent on this album as it is on say, Train of Thought or Awake. However, Metropolis Part 2 offers so much more to the listener. It is a truly uplifting listen and worthy of the highest respect.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the key albums to understand the development of the progmetal over the 90's and why not, the explosion of progressive metal/rock on the last decade. Althought have been a lot of discussions whereas DT is responsable for that, I have to say that even if they are not 100% responsable, a big part of that is due to them (and especially because of this album and Awake).\n\nAnd well, this album deserves all the hype it has created. For the time of its release this kind of music was striking original and fresh (today the sound is somehow dated), and produced a huge amount of copycats bands all over the world. The best way to describe this album is just plain \"prog-metal\". This is how it is suppouse to sound, and in many ways, the music in this album became a necesary point of reference when talking about the genre. When the people say that the music in here is like a blend of 80's heavy metal and thash with ideas of the 70 progressive acts (Yes, Gentle Giant, Genesis, ELP), they are telling the most accurate description of this music in words, and is quite satisfactory tho give that precise description is that few words.\n\nIn case you don't know, the musicanship of the band members is top notch, and whereas this is a very melodic album, there are a lot of highly technical aspects. The main song in here: Metropolis pt. I is an excelent showcase for that. A somber melody sound it's listened at the beggining (joined for the rest of the band), then the middle part begins, and well, that is what technical metal is all about: crazy riffs, complicated tempos, constant and abrupt changes of time signatures, interaction between all instruments, incredible soloing, unexpected things, etc,etc. And then a slower and very melodic part ends the song. The other longer tracks in here, except Pull me under (which arguably is more hevy metal with hints of prog metal), have a similar estructure. The shorter songs however have a different approach. There is a forgetable ballad (Another day), a beautiful moody 2 minute piano & synth piece (Wait for Sleep), and Surrounded, which is a very orginal song, when melody, technical stuff and excelent songwriting meet (the tension is built over the first minutes and released in the fourth), it really can't get better than this and Metropolis.\n\nOne of the surprising thing about this album is that is quite easy to digest, once you've listened this a couple of times, probably you will be hooked up for a long time, even for a very very long time. Thats because the music is complicated and interesting enough to keep you coming back for more. There are not dull moments, or uninteristing tracks, and the album runs from the beggining to the end without becoming annoying.\n\nThe production is a great step forward from their last album, but it's not their best. The drums sound very mechanic and the guitar lacks a little bit of the bass espectrum, the bass is not very thick and the keyboards (specially the strings) sound quite dated. The overall sound obtained is somehow dry and mechanical, just like the drums. In some other genres, or albums, this would be a terrible thing, but in here the sound helps to set the mood, and give the music a lot of distinction. That is a very interesting thing. In fact the band returned to the I&W recording studios to record A Change of seasons. The reason for that was indeed\nto regain the sound of the I&W sessions.\n\nAs I said before, many bands of the genre at some point of their carrer copied ideas from this album, or just make a lot of references (even in the production) to it. 14 years have gone and it have passed the test of time, retaining its place on the royalty of prog metal albums. This album reestarrted a revolution and its influence can be still listened to this days. Very good stuff, Higly recommended for anybody (except possible if you are a enemy of the melody and keys).\n",
        "\nAs everyone knows Dream Theater are the definitive prog metal band and this is their definitive album. Turns out it happens to be their best album as well. The band became fairly popular with this album and therefore became the flag bearers of proggessive metal. \n\nMoving on to the album itself. It's metal, very metal. At this point Dream Theater still had an approach that while amazing you with the instrumental sections, could also kick your ass. The best example of this is Pull Me Under. Dream Theater's most recognizable song is one hell of a killer tune. The riffs are heavy, the vocals powerful and slightly agressive, and even the keyboards tear shit up. \n\nAfter Pull Me Under we come to the ballad. Another Day was thought by the band and label to be the big hit from the album. Kind of ironic how the heaviest song on the album was a much bigger hit. Well it's a good song and fits the album. James LaBrie, the new singer at this point, shows off his ability. Nothing spectacular but makes sense. Then we get to a bit of a lull with Take The Time and Surrounded. Both are very good songs but seem to just keep the album at the same point, not moving ahead. Still I really like those songs. \n\nImages and Words really sets off now. Metropolis is one of the best Dream Theater songs, if not the best. This song was actually written as far back as 1989, too bad it wasn't on When Dream And Day Unite. It's a long epic song that covers alot of styles. Some of the song is slower with keyboards as the lead, and then it builds up to a nice riff. LaBire's vocals are top notch here. The instrumental section in this one blows me away every time I hear it. \n\nUnder A Glass Moon is next and is a good song but not really woth talking about much. It's heavy and fast, the fastest song on here in fact. Then we move on to the highlight of this album. The epic, beautiful, chaotic, amazing masterpiece that starts with Wait For Sleep. Wait For Sleep is basically a piano and vocal intro to Learning To Live. Learning To Live is probably Dream Theater's greatest achivement next to A Change Of Seasons. This song has everything you could want. Long insturmentals run throughout, softer melodic sections flow into heavy parts. Toward the end the song gets so good, with a dueling gutiar, keyboard, and even bass part. You can just feel so much emotion being put into every note. \n\nSo this is Dream Theater's best album. For the second time they put out a great album that pushes the boundaries of prog metal. At this point they really haven't doen any wrong, and won't until Falling Into Infinity. So do yourself a favor and get this. Even if you don't like prog metal there is something here to get you. Truly an awsome album.\n",
        "\nThis is Dream Theater's first album, before they were the flag bearers of prog metal, before they had songs upwards of 20 minutes(A Change Of Seasons was partially wirtten as early as the second demo, btu was aroudn 17 minutes), before James LaBrie. \n\nWell turns out it's pretty awesome. At this point Dream Theater is much more metal than they are progressive, which is a good thing. Basically this is what Queensryche would have sounded like if they had musicians of this caliber. This album is very different than what you think of when Dream Theater is mentioned. \n\nFor the most part this album is as progressive as it gets for 1989, which means that it still is metal. The riff is still domiant and Petrucci really knew how to riff it up at one point. \n\nWe start off with A Fortune In Lies, which is one of my favorite Dream Theater songs. It has a monster main riff and is just so metal. Status Seeker is a weak point and is very 80's cheese. Then we get the amazing Ytse Jam. This is the song that hints at what Dream Theater will do in the future. It's prog as fuck and just shows how talented these guys are. The main riff is so cool I can't even describe it. The Killing Hand is another great song, less metal than some but still very good. For the most part the album after The Killing hand is pretty much the same, all good but nothing spectacular. The exception is Afterlife, which is fast and very melodic. The chorus is just brings the song to such a climax, it works so well. \n\nSo all in all only a fraction of modern Dream Theater, but one of their more metallic releases. If you like 80's prog metal you will like this. If you are a die hard Dream Theater fan just get passed Charlie Dominici's vocals and you will like it too.\n",
        "\nAfter years of \"pulling off\" albums that better all previous recordings (except probably for Falling Into Infinity), DT has once again surprised the world with another \"different\" release. It wouldn't be fair to say that this is their best work so far, but certainly the heaviest. After two excelent Concept albums, (the latter with non concept tracks on the first cd), this \"change\" into non-conceptual writting was probably where the band found their best options. Along with some clear heavyness and the obvious talent and some more experience, voil\u00e1, you have TRAIN OF THOUGHT!\n\nOn a general view, the album is pretty well balanced, not only because you \"feel\" their heavyness throughout (which isn't that common on a DT album), but mainly every song is as you'd expect, minimum 7 minutes long (no surprise there)...and that is the beauty of this album, is that you don't \"feel\" those 7 minutes. Its so well crafted between the melodies and the technique that you'll want some more at the end of each song.\nThe quintet have risen to another level and thanfully so, have created yet another album to be remembered.\n\nA review on some of the tracks just to open up the appetite...\n\nAS I AM:\nIts a great opening once you get used to it, and it doesn't take many listens. It has a kind of catchy vibe with a riff that isn't particularly their most intricate nevertheless very intelligent. It starts with Myung performing some bass harmonics just before Portnoy presents his sounding kit (GREAT sounding kit) that will be with you for the next 70 minutes. So the Riff come in after this small intro and soon enough LaBrie's vocals join the party. He sounds better in this type of environment (heavy) that probably everyone ever thought. The song will have very few intricacies apart from some tempo changes with the riff + drums and the lyrics overlapping just before the second chorus, but that also shows that they needn't always show off immensely to bring you an awesome powerful riff that will have you headbanging in your living room.\nThe solo is probably the most memorable part on this first song as Petrucci uses is talent to good purpose giving clearly a bigger dimension to the song as it runs from one part of the song to its original riff, finishing off with portnoy's bashing away tempos and drum fills before LaBries last chorus is handed to him. The song finishes as the pace quickens and the guitar feedbacking at the end giving it a nice clearly touch, even if for a bit too long...\n\nTHIS DYING SOUL\nA great drums intro and a few more intricacies are apparent on this song from the off, you'll hear some cymabally noises in between the drumming thunders , but those are Mr Rudess' intro contribution. It is followed by another magnificient guitar solo that melt with rudess' talent just before the riff comes in.\nAfter that it all goes kinda quite when LaBries ventures to join. The chorus comes in bringing the same beautiful solo at the end of it. Then it all spees up on all fronts as the intro is recalled. It has some tempo variation into a kind of mini bridge before the chorus welcomes you again into the heart of the song. It is followed by some more tempo changes, a bit of Glass Prison fades in and out and it is all very composed up to ear, although you can find the vocals a bit monotonous in this song, but then the intrumental bit after makes up for the rest of it. Simply put you'll hear some of their nicest changes and technique on here. Variations from Rudess and Petrucci will have you glued to memorize all the solos (not that many) whilst Portnoy keeps you rhythmically entertained. It finishes off with some very intricate scale play by petrucci and Rudess some double bass to finalize.\n\nENDLESS SACRIFICE\nThe \"Ballad\" of the album, in a way...\nIt starts with a beautiful melody in an off 4/4 fingerpicking mode, with some great accompanying by Portnoy. The vocals come nicely into this melody and it grows slowly slowly into a powerfull chorus, faints of Pantera-Nevermore can be appreciated here, as it mellows back down into the body of the song.\nAs it reaches the 5th minute all DT fans will be loving this part as the bands most proficient elements come to life on an intro that is both led by rudess' skills and some great guitar. The tempos will change as expected and it mellows into a kind but not quite psychadelic groove only to lift off again by the keyboards and guitar slos taking leads from each other. Portnoy's ever present reating great rhythms on all the changes. The leads from Petrucci and Rudess with link for the end bit in a very positive finish. But there's more...oh yes, it carries on onto the main riff and some grreat double bass by Mike Portnoy during some catchy riffs from Petrucci leading it all back to the vocals in a perfect balanced manner. The songs finishes after this last vocals with the enhancement of the drums over a guitar riff.\n\nHONOR THY FATHER\nAgain, the drums come into play exquisitely, but awesomely almost taking away your breath away. Joined by the guita riff in an off beat tempo only to link again in a 4/4 manner. Vocals come into play probably not in their best effort, but you'll get used to it as you get to know the song. It is the crudest song of the whole cd and probably the heaviest also. It has some good double bass and varied changes throughout. It comes to the middle, you'll find your rudess solos as well as petrucci contribution and at around the 8th minute the song and it iniciates cleverly into the beggining off beats (like the intro). LaBrie sing the remaining of the song as it mini explodes to its conclusion.\n\nVACANT\nIs a beautiful song accompained by some violin orchestration. There's no drums on this track and James' voice kind of tunes nicely into the feel of it. Major work here by Rudess as he is clearly the leader of this song.\n\nSTREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS\nLed by the sound still of VACANT, this intrumental comes into life, probably the best intrumental they's done so far. Very complex at parts, very simplified in others, all in all, a song you won't get bored of even it being a 11 minute song plainly instrumental.\n\nIN THE NAME OF GOD\nAn amazing eastern-esque type riff omes into play, you might find it catchy after some listens, but not a damaging catchy, much on the contrary. The drums come heavily into the song. It goes on for about a minute of changes up until the main riff comes along, very powerful riff in this song. Obviously the lyrics are a commanding force in this song, reminding one of THE GREAT DEBATE in the previous album. The song is very well balanced, very powerful with a mellowed down in tempo chorus. this will probably the song that James will find more difficulty when playing live due to the high notes. The instrumental parts of this song are also remarkable, very arabian like solos at some stage that goes really well with Rudess' keyboard playing near the 10th minute mark. The vacals come back into play for the last time on the album and it finishes of with a great outro inviting every band member and leaving Rudess to close with the last notes.\n\n\nTo finish off, I would say that this is amongst the best works the band has done so far, even though I believe that there is better to come. Whether you are a fan or not, this is an album that is heavy, powerfull, and brilliantly played. If you enjoy metal, you'll enjoy this.\n\nLuis Cardina\n",
        "\nEvery band needs \u201cits\u201d album. Surely from a technical standpoint, all albums created by a band are their own, but very few bands are truly able to design an album whereas the listener is forced to utter to himself:\n\n\u201cThis is *blank* at their best, and I\u2019ll always remember this record.\u201d\n\nIn Dream Theater\u2019s case, even at this point in July of 2006, \u201cMetropolis \u2013 Part II: Scenes From A Memory\u201d is that album to them. As \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d was to Metallica, \u201cMachine Head\u201d to Deep Purple, \u201cDark Side of the Moon\u201d to Pink Floyd, or even \u201cNumber of the Beast\u201d to Iron Maiden, \u201cScenes\u201d has so far survived the test of time to become the near unanimous selection among hardcore Dream Theater fans as the band\u2019s tour-de-force. \n\nBut let\u2019s get past the clich\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cScenes\u201d is a concept album, involving death, spirit, and betrayal. Quite frankly, lyrics have never been a strong point for Dream Theater, with even the best works of the pen to paper resulting in respectable lyrical works at best. The story, even with a booklet in hand, is hard to follow, and one that takes much too much interpretation to truly enjoy as it goes along. Say what you must, but upon a listeners first venture into \u201cScenes,\u201d you seldom have a clue what is going on.\n\nThe story begins with \u201cOverture 1928,\u201d (following a needless \u201cRegression\u201d) an instrumental that covers various passages from throughout the record. The whole band shines here, as no needless solos are added and emotion runs high. By the time it is finished, the listener is immediately thrusted into \u201cStrange D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu.\u201d This song serves as one of the shorter, more poppy sides to \u201cScenes.\u201d By this, I simply mean that the song is addicting through its chorus, and one can find themselves singing and humming along to \u201cStrange D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u201d even upon conclusion.\n\nNext up is \u201cThrough My Words,\u201d which is simply a lead-up to \u201cFatal Tragedy,\u201d and involves only keyboardist Jordan Rudess with vocalist James LaBrie. \u201cFatal Tragedy\u201d begins on a sudden note, and throws the listener into the first \u201cdrag on\u201d song of the album. The song\u2019s chorus is not overly catchy, and the beginning of the song\u2019s final instrumental section seems to drag on and on. However, if the listener is to stick through the mindless keyboard and guitar solos for a while, they are taken to complete Progressive Metal heaven. In translation:\n\nThe first ever unison solo between John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess.\n\nBy the time Jordan Rudess and guitarist John Petrucci finish about a minute of this impressive unison, which has been labeled as a \u201cmusical orgasm\u201d by some, the listener is immediately taken into \u201cBeyond This Life.\u201d The song opens with a great riff, and proceeds to cover all sides known to music. Heavy and melodic. Soloing and riffing. Angry and hopeful. The song covers every angle on this one, and as one can easily imagine, it results in a drawn out marathon that can become tiresome. This here is a perfect example of overdoing it, as Rudess and Petrucci waste a solid four minutes simply playing \u201ccircus music,\u201d or so I quote. \n\nAgain, a poppy tack arises in \u201cThrough Her Eyes,\u201d a number that again, can be heard being hummed and replicated worldwide through Dream Theater fans. Afterwards, we enter the final \u201cmarathon\u201d so-to-speak of the album, \u201cHome.\u201d Home is an addictive song, with some serious melodies and great riffing, but it simply suffers from being overdone. I know that it is meaningful to the story, but do we really need three minutes of \u201cpleasure noises\u201d? Do we really need Arabian music being played for two minutes upon the conclusion of the song? The answer is no.\n\nThe instrumental, \u201cThe Dance of Eternity\u201d follows. Now I must admit that this certainly showcases the band\u2019s overall skill, and even though it does nothing for the story, it is certainly entertaining to listen to. John Petrucci rips out the seven string guitar here, and plays one of the hardest songs in the entire Dream Theater catalog. Considering Petrucci is undoubtedly a top 5 guitarist in the world at this point, you can imagine just how stunning his passages are, along with the rest of his super-human band mates.\n\nTo conclude our story, we get the trio of \u201cOne Last Time\u201d, \u201cThe Spirit Carries On\u201d, and \u201cFinally Free.\u201d Gone in each are the needless solos, and in place are melodic vocals, respectable lyrics, all while still displaying great musicianship as a whole. During \u201cThe Spirit Carries On,\u201d Petrucci takes the listener through a guitar solo that has truly caused listeners to break down and shed a few tears. The song is in every sense of the word; beautiful, and its stunning climax is even more so.\n\n\u201cFinally Free\u201d concludes the album and its story with a heavy band-jam, but for the most part is under control through-out. Again, the listener is shown the best sides of Dream Theater, as we get melodic vocals and guitar, heavy riffing, and all around solid musicianship.\n\nIn conclusion, every song with exceptions to a few are catchy vocally, even though some lyrics do fall short. \u201cBeyond This Life\u201d, \u201cHome\u201d, and sections of \u201cFatal Tragedy\u201d are quite unnecessary, but can be easily enjoyed during a casual run-through of the record. Everything else is perfect, as the album features more overall emotion than any metal record I\u2019ve ever heard. \n\nOne must approach this record with open ears, and with no negative bias toward the band or the direction they took upon writing this masterpiece. \u201cScenes\u201d is quite simply, the greatest album I\u2019ve ever heard. Yes a few songs are drawn out; yes the lyrics are \u201ciffy\u201d at best, but more importantly:\n\nEvery single song has some sort of meaning, a meaning that is immediately felt after its end, and a meaning that will stick with the listener for his / her entire life. It surely has never left me, seven years after this album enriched my existence.\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Album Highs: Strange D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, The Spirit Carries On, Finally Free\n\n*** 6% deducted for needless musicianship, soloing, and wanking\n",
        "\nApparently your session has expired while you were typing your review, please re-login and try again\n\nHere's what you entered in the review body for copy and pasting purposes:\n\nWell, I watched this DVD with an open mind, not being a Dream Theater fan for many years though at the same time not having anything against them. I\u2019d heard Train of Thought and quite frankly thought it was brilliant, but I was introduced to them fully and introduced to most of their albums by a friend, and that also included this gem, a live DVD of Dream Theater\u2019s gig on their Train of Thought tour at the legendary Budokan arena in Tokyo. When I saw the package it wasn\u2019t overly impressive and a booklet was nowhere to be seen. But seriously, that doesn\u2019t matter when you have two dvd\u2019s that are full of such great music? \n\nI was able to enjoy a whole recorded Dream Theater, featuring 18 tracks (One of them a keyboard solo, one an medly of instrumental sections from past songs). They kicked off with hit \u201cAs I am\u201d and other album song \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d Seeing them play these songs live is breathtaking. As they ripped through other album tracks like \u201cEndless Sacrifice\u201d and the classic \u201cBeyond this Life\u201d during the early stage of the DVD! James LaBrie can certainly sing live despite a few awkward patched here and there. But his vocals are possibly even better than on the studio when the ballads are sung. Especially \u201cHollow Years\u201d These songs are all great and even better to witness live than on a the studio releases even. Watching everyone Rudess, Portnoy, Petrucci and Muyng live is amazing. \n\nNever is the incredible musicianship more apparent then on the stunning \u201cInstrumedley\u201d which is one of the real highlights. It was stunning! An epic track that as the title describes is a medley of all the instrumental sections that Dream Theater have done, including some Liquid Tension Experiment as well! A true demonstration of why these guys are for me, the greatest musical ensemble in rock and metal history! Each one a master at their own craft and unlike some groups including great individual musicians, it all works so well. \n\nThe gig goes on and on in fantastic fashion. They rip through more classics such as \u201cNew Millennium\u201d \u201ctrial of Tears\u201d etc. We even have time for a two-part keyboard solo from the masterful Jordan Rudess. After watching this guy play I decided to take up keyboards. His first section is pretty mandatory, doing scales on the keyboard, it\u2019s hardly tuneful but it has a certain space age edge to it that makes it work. His second section is what really works for me, an oriental style tune that is beautiful, purely beautiful. A real treat! \n\nThe classics keep coming as the strain starts to show on LaBrie\u2019s vocals. He gets a rest for the epic instrumental off Train of Thought \u201cStream of Consciousness\u201d that once again [proves their musical wizardry. The crowd really enjoyed this one and they got one heck of a cheer at the end. James LaBrie returned to an applause as they closed with what else but their biggest ever commercial hit, the insanely catchy \u201cPull Me Under\u201d His singing sounds a bit strained at times here, but you still find yourself singing along to \u201cThis world is spinning around me, This world is spinning without me\u201d and so forth. They leave\u2026 \n\nBut of course like most bands they return for the encore. They only play one of course, because that is the truly epic 14 minute masterpiece off Train of Thought\u201dIn the Name of God\u201d It sound great here like on the album, despite a few dodgy notes from La Brie, he still sounds good and can obviously sing live, but he has a tendancy of hitting a few notes funnily and strangely enough singing the harsher vocals in a way that you\u2019d have no idea what he was saying if you weren\u2019t aware of the lyrics already. But it\u2019s still a great track to close, and at the end you have a great feeling of satisfaction. And who wouldn\u2019t after witnessing a 3hour show from these masters? \n\nThe second disk is full of some nice extras including an entertaining drum solo. A short run through of their career, a tour documentary and both a bit about the keyboards and guitars. Ok, neither Petrucci nor Rudess explain in the most ott entertaining way ever, but they tell it how it is, and it\u2019s quite interesting. Nice little bonus DVD worth watching especially for the drum solo. \n\nNegatives \u2013 La Brie\u2019s rare tendencies to sound a bit off or be impossible to understand. The package isn\u2019t too amazing either\u2026 \n\nPositives \u2013 Great live show in general, Truly amazing examples of musicianship, most of the classics, some nice treats, excellent picture and sound quality. A good little bonus DVD \n\nIf you\u2019re a Dream Theater fan, this is an essential thing to own. If you hate \u2018em, avoid at all costs. If neutral, I\u2019d still encourage you to buy, buy, buy!\n",
        "\nEveryone else on this page has gone at it reviewing the main song on this ep. Nobody gave the covers a fair chance. So I'll concentrate on the songs 2-5 for the purpose of giving this ep. the credit it deserves.\n\nFirst off, the song Change of season is one of Dream Theater's greatest of a long list of masterpieces. It is a rollecoster of emotions; high points, low points, great solos, instrumental all played with great virtuasity. No other singer can touch James LaBrie, his voice is pure gold. This guy is the star of this album. \n\nFuneral for a friend/ Love lies bleeding, is a song originally recorded by Elton John and the opener on the \"Goodbuy yellow brick road\" album. Writen by him and Bernie Taupin. The differences between this one and the one covered by DT is not a whole lot . Only James voice brings it back to life in a whole different being and Derek Sherinian improves the synth/piano intro on Funeral for a friend. Although Dream theater covered and made it their tune you can tell it has that stamp of Elton John on it. It has that \"sounds very 70's\" sound.\n\nPerfect strangers, originaly from the newly reunited Deep Purple's album \"perfect strangers\". I'm guessing DT wanted to show that they were not casual fans of Deep Purple by recording this song. This one is really faithfull to the original only this time James steps into grounds I wish he didn't step into often. His voice wasn't made for imitating Gillan. Only Gillan can do Gillan. Besides that a very good tune and neatly done.\n\nTrack # 4, I'll call this the Zeppelin medley. Very unusual choices out of all the great songs in Zep's catalogue, but hey! this is Dream Theater we're talking about; they can make any song great. \"The Rover\" is a song out of the\"Physical Graffitti\" album, a real groovy tune with a good groovy opening riff. Only the intro is used. Then there's Achilles last stand, very good song out of the \"Presence\" album. But only a mid section of the song is used, too bad cause this song rules. And last but not least \"The song remains the same\" from the\"houses of Holy album\", you know the one with the naked children on the cover climbing what it seems like an apocalyptic pile of rocks under a pale red sky. This could be Zep's most prog sounding song ever. On this song James proves you can sound like Robert Plant without sounding stupid, and not blowing your vocal chords (listen to Vinnie Vincent's first album or any Kingdome come album for reference). John Petricci nails those solos as if he had been possessed by Jimmy Page's soul. This medley is very entertaining and rocks the socks off any Led Zeppelin fan in need of a re-charge.\n\nThe last song is also a medley titled\" The big Medley\" It first contains the opening song or intro from Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\", In the Flesh?. In my opinion this song lacks something the original had, that is the vocals. The original sounded so much better because James LaBrie always tries to make everything sound big and operatic and this intro didn't need that. Besides that it sounds identical to the original. Then comes Kansas \"Carry on my wayward son\". Or lets say the intrumental after the opening chorus of the song. Not much to say here only that I would had added a bit more of this song to the medley, atleast the opening verses. Then there's Bohemian Rhapsody. Who the hell doesn't know this song?; Guiness song of the century. The part added to this medley is the one after all the opera singers say \"Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me\". Yeah you know, the hard rock part up till' they are about to sing that nothing really matters. Then comes Journeys \"Loving, touching squeezing\" and let me tell you something; it takes balls to try and cover a song sang by Steve Perry and played by Neal Schon. This is one of those songs (or section of a song) that I'm glad they didn't messed up. James does a decent Steve Perry and Pretrucci plays a great Schon. Then come \"Cruise control\". I really don't know who originally played this song and really doesn't bothers me not knowing it either. It is a less than a minute long instrumental that uplifts the song from ballad to mid tempo. Last is \"Turn it on again\" by Genesis. Not much to say here only that it is a two line chorus to end this medley on happy terms.\n\nI'd say all this and a 23 minute Dream Theater masterpiece deserves the rank i gave it.\n",
        "\nAwake is called the dark album from Dream Theater, cause of the depressive emotion you have all along in the songs. But that's not a bad thing in fact! Even if some people believes that this release is not progressive enough but too much focus on the heavy sound, I would tell that they are wrong. How could the progressive emotion of the music doesn't mix with heavy? I think that this album reflect that it can be mixed!\n\nAfter the success of Images and Words on the prog-metal scene, Dream Theater do as they want and make something really different from their previous album. This is just the reflection of a progression through the music. The progression could be bad or good for different person and that is more a subjective opinion than a fact. For myself, I don't think it is worst or better than Images and Words, it is just different and good!\n\nThere are song that are heavier and other that are more soft, just like on an usual DT release. Songs like 6:00, Caught In A Web, The Mirror, Lie represent more the heavy section of the release. These last songs are really great with a good play of guitar work and an awesome deal of bass and drums along with an atmospheric keyboard that sometime do a solo or two. Labrie sing with energy but sometime he push maybe a little bit too much like on Caught In A Web, that is not my favorite around. 6:00 is just a magnific song to begin the Cd with a very good intense drumming that get you into the Cd. The Mirror is an usual Mike Portnoy signature for the lyrics and the sound. A more crushing sound with agressive lyrics that is what he writes! Lie really follows hand in hand The Mirror with another agressive sound that tells: \"Don't tell me, you taugh of me!\". The riff of this song has crush and the solos are fast, but maybe lack some emotion.\n\nOther song are more on the soft side like Innoncence Faded, The Silent Man (that is part of the A Mind Behind Itself), Lifting Shadows off a Dream and Scarred. These tracks are all great show a lot of emotion in the lyrics and in the music. Lifting Shadows off a Dream is a composition of Myung and the lyrics are very poetic. It is indeed one of the best writter of DT and it is sad that he doesn't write anymore. Scarred really get you straigh in the heart with a melodic sound and some more heavy part.\n\nBut this release I think that this release is the place of two main tracks: \"A Mind Behind Itself\" and \"Space Dye-Vest\". The first is three song that are linked together showing the world into the mind of a little boy. Erotomania is the first part of the serie and it is a instrumental episode with a lot of solos of all the kind. It is a good song, but not one of the best around they have made. Sometime you feel like it is going nowhere and then it falls into the crushing Voices. This song is a equilibrum between heavy and soft reflecting how the world have two different point of views and that the main character of the song is trapped in. The Silent Man is an accoustic song with a great Petrucci work and a Labrie that we don't find often with a really soft voice. Weirdly this Silent Man sound like if it is Myung...\n\nSpace Dye-Vest is the most depressive song of all DT carrier and I don't think it will be beaten by any other song. It is a song written by Kevin Moore and the majesty of his music-wise is shown through the whole song. It is one of the finest work I have never listen to. The keyboard are just impressive and the ambiance of the song is incredible. Even Labrie doesn't sound like he is the same.\n\nAwake is one of the dark episode of Dream Theater, but remain a wonderful album with complex song writting, beautiful solos and a perfect ambiance in the whole Cd from the beginning until the last note of keyboard! Nearly the perfection...99%. A must for everyone into metal!\n",
        "\nI own the entire discography of Dream Theater at the exception of some booklets and special release and this DVD is one my favorite life album ever. It is in my opinion the finest work of images and of music on stage of Dream Theater. The images of this DVD is like if it was real! I mean you can even try to touch to the gigantic drum of Mike Portnoy or trying to see how Petrucci plays his solos with the perfection even outside of studio. At first, we could think that it is a movie about this band, but it is a live DVD of a 3 hours perfomance on stage. For the music, the choice of the tracks are good and are spread around all of their discography even if it is a show for Train of Thought which was their last release at this time.\n\nFirst, it starts with As I Am and it really catch you there where you want it. Powerful music representation with energy in the music. It is one of the best track to begin a show. The little problem is that Labrie sound on this track is not perfect and that he has some problem starting the show. But this doesn't stop him of putting energy on stage. Then it switch to This Dying Soul, heavy sound with good instruments passages. Still again, something is wrong with Labrie's singing just like it wasn't fix yet with the volume of the music going on.\n\nBut everything is fix when it follows on Beyond This Life. Impressive Labrie voice that is heard on Scenes from a Memory is there and is even magic with the music. The very impressive part of this song is when they do the jamming thing. It is just awesome! Petrucci plays a very strong jamming solo with a sound that chills me to the bone everytime I hear it! It is powerful and clear, beginning slowly like any good progressive sound and this pushing faster and faster along with the bass rolling a good riff and the drum of Mike always crushing down the beat with so much energy. After the Petrucci part, Portnoy and Rudess (on keyboard) do an awesome fighting of drums vs the keyboard. One of my favorite part is the one with the cow bells it is really impressive to see and hear how they keep the thing together!\n\nThen, after Beyond This Life, there is Hollow Years with some add-ons with Petrucci playing a little solo of his own and a more classical style of sound of guitar at the opening of it. Following that, there is War Inside My Head/The Test That Stumped Them All. Those tracks are well played on scene and there is a strong energy going out of it. It goes on with Endless Sacrifice, a ToT track, well play just like if they were on studio. The Instrumendly is an impressive tracks where Portnoy, Myung, Petrucci and Rudess are playing parts of instrumental songs all together in a happy-mixing. Everytime the listener is there trying to find what tracks they are playing and then it switch to another one. The main tracks of this song which the other parts are mix together is flowing music is The Dance of Eternity. Two of my favorite parts of this unique track are the Metropolis solos and the YTSE JAM part!\nThen there is the Trial of Tears, a long track that some could find more boring, but it is one of the few time that they play it live and for the true fans of DT, it is a good song. Then there is New Millennium, with the weird bass of Myung playing very difficult part and making a lot of tapping on this 12 strings type of bass. Then there is a good standing of Jordan Rudess making a solo of his own with strange sound and a classical part of piano as he likes to do. It is a good standing. It is followed with the track named Only a Matter of Time coming out of the first studio album of DT. People wanted to see how Labrie would do on this song that was not originaly sing by him. He does good, but lack some speed and he is always trying to catch his breath. The intrumental ending of this track that was add for the show is a very good review of the entire track at a fast speed.\n\nThen it is the depressing track named Disappear. It is one of the missed track of this album. The music mixing is not awesome, but it is a though songs to play live. Sometime you don't even hear what Labrie is singing or the drum is too heavy to hear the keyboards very well as it should be. Maybe it will be better next time, and they must pratice it further to play it with the entire energy it should have! Then they make their come back with Pull Me Under which is there classic, always well played and impressive energy with the crowd which is one of the few times on the DVD. The final track is In The Name of God which is the final track of ToT too. Still a good DT sound just like if they were playing only with perfection the lines.\n\nAlong with the show itself, the DVD comes with donus material like a Japanese Documentary that was turned before the actual show where you can see each members explaining how they came to play in Budokan. It is one of the best documentary I have seen on DT.\n\nSo actually, if you want to buy a good DVD of Dream Theater or that you are a fan of prog-metal, you should actualy buy Live at Budokan. It is an unique and one of the best music DVD I have seen of my life along with some classic like \"Rock in Rio\" from Iron Maiden! 95% for this live DVD!\n",
        "\nDream Theater are in a difficult place: no matter what they do, their many fans will complain. It is true that Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence did have some major weaknesses, but Train of Thought was blasted by fans for being too heavy, not having enough keyboards, and/or wasting James LaBrie. I agree that LaBrie's vocal parts were weak, but as for the other two, it was Dream Theater evolving. Fans just complained about the fact that Petrucci's guitar was dominant and overlooked the fact that it was them at their most consistent and strongest lyrically. They didn't meander off without a direction like they constantly did in \"Scenes From a Memory.\" Unfortunately, Dream Theater listened to those fans and tried to fix everything that those fans have complained about: Petrucci is given no room to work, another 20+ epic was written, plus they tried to make themselves more accessible. Hence tracks 2-4 were penned: 2 being a sappy ballad, 3 seemingly inspired by Coldplay, and 4 sounding like modern U2. Few are the fans that will enjoy these, although now that I think about it, if they had done something more along the lines of \"War\"-era U2, the results might have been different; just a thought.\n\nAnyway, \"The Root of All Evil\" has been trashed by many of the fans for some reason; I thought it was great. Heavy rhythm guitars and I like the tuning that Rudess used for his solo. Petrucci's solo is short and weak, but they redeem for that with a haunting piano outro (although I admit I have a weakness for piano outro's, some of my favorite songs being DT's \"In the Name of God,\" Faith No More's \"Epic,\" and Opeth's \"Leper Affinity\"). \"Panic Attack\" starts out with a complex bass section by Myung, and explodes into heavy 7-string riffing. This would probably be one of my favorite DT songs if Petrucci didn't deliver his weakest solo ever. In \"Never Enough,\" Petrucci goes for quality instead of quantity, making his solo one of his best. \"Sacrificed Sons\" seems about 2-3 years late, being about the Twin Towers, but the instrumental section is great. This is really Petrucci's only extended solo, and he takes full advantage. His riff after the solo is memorable as well. I love the way that Mike Portnoy completely changes the rhythm of the song about 8:00 in, even with the rest of the band continuing the same riff. \"Octavarium\" is difficult for me to grade, because I have only heard several songs that long. I can't really tell if it's good or not as a whole; there are many slow and boring sections in the song, something that wasn't in \"A Change of Seasons\" and Symphony X's \"Odyssey,\" which were interesting the entire way through, but then again, those two set the bar pretty high. Throughout the album James LaBrie proves he is not the weak link in the band. His vocal work is his best in ten years at least; especially in \"The Root of All Evil\" and \"Never Enough\" where his singing is top-notch.\n\nAnyway, I wish people would stop comparing this to DT's past albums. It isn't a return to Images & Words, whoever says so is wrong. It is a progression, and while there are some good and even great moments, it is far from their best. Even so, there is enough good stuff to make this a worthy chapter in Dream Theater's history.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll say it right off the bat: Octavarium is Dream Theater\u2019s weakest album since Falling into Infinity. The instrumentalism that we Dream Theater fans have come to love over the years is almost absent from the album. \u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d and \u201cI Walk Beside You\u201d are embarrassingly bad pop attempts, the latter sounding kind of like U2 and the former containing some of the worst lyrics I have ever heard outside of emo. \u201cThe Root of All Evil\u201d and \u201cThese Walls\u201d are boring rehashings of the quote-unquote Dream Theater sound, and they don\u2019t really take hold as memorable songs. Also, there is almost nothing there in the way of instrumental sections \u2013 \u201cRoot\u201d has a short guitar solo and a short synth solo, and \u201cWalls\u201d has nothing. \u201cPanic Attack\u201d is okay, but again never really picks up into a monstrosity like it could. The only songs with real developed instrumental parts in them are \u201cNever Enough,\u201d \u201cSacrificed Sons,\u201d and the title track \u201cOctavarium.\u201d Of these, \u201cNever\u201d has probably the worst chorus of any DT song, and \u201cSons\u201d is just pretty boring. The only approximation of something worth listening to on this whole album is the 24-minute title track. It\u2019s decent, with somewhat of a retro-prog feel to it. It\u2019s no \u201cA Change of Seasons,\u201d but it at least holds interest throughout the whole thing. So basically, I recommend you download the title track, and don\u2019t pay any attention to the rest. Dream Theater fans will probably be disappointed (I was), and if you\u2019re not a fan then don\u2019t touch this with a ten-foot pole. So I\u2019m giving it a 60, or barely passing \u2013 for the title track if nothing else.\n",
        "\nScenes From a Memory basically encapsulates how people see Dream Theater. You've got the confusing (albeit dead simple when you get down to it) story. You've got the schlock-y keyboards. You've got James LaBrie in tight leather pants singing like a girl. And you've got the endless and insanely complex instrumental passages. The view is reinforced by the hordes of fans and laymen who hail this album as the absolute apex of progressive metal.\n\n\"I mean, man, its so, like, deep you know? It has like a story and stuff.\n\nAnd they play really fast.\"\n\nNow, that isn't to paint everybody who loves this record as a fumbling vocabulary-deficient Neanderthal (or homo, huh huh, erectus) but man, this thing is flawed and deeply so. First of all, the lyrical concept is pretty limp and after the initial period of discovery it becomes very thin. Operation: Mindcrime this ain't. Since most of the lyrics are based upon storyline exposition very few manage to be particularly good lyrically outside of the context of the storyline. Far too often we're hit by blocks of what amounts to scene description, and even the more broad lyrics continually bring you back to the story by dropping in a \"Victoria\" on you. \"Finally Free\", for instance, is just fantastic but it cannot stand alone due to the fact that every single line is overtly plot-centric. Basically the only song that doesn't succumb to this trap is \"Through Her Eyes\"... but no amount of lyrical good will can turn that particular ugly duckling into a swan. It's terrible.\n\nNow, the lyrics don't necessarily have to reach Awake (or even Falling Into Infinity) levels if the music stands up. And it does. Sort of. See, throughout this album Dream Theater applies their particular brand of magic and strikes the listener into awestruck silence. I swear to ya, sometimes when I'm listening to \"Home\" and they finally break into that classic \"Metropolis\" riff before the chorus I feel my hair stand on end. It isn't so much the appearance of the riff itself (there are a number of other musical ties throughout the album), but the way its implemented following a beautiful piece of crunch-heavy business with a set of lyrics closely tied to the original opus. You know its coming, and then it hits ya. There are a good number of other such great moments sprinkled throughout the album, but the problem is that 90% of the compositions are flawed in some way.\n\nBefore I go into a big ol' list of said problems I'd like to discuss new keyboardist Jordan Rudess a little bit. Firstly, Jordan Rudess is a master of his instrument. I personally can't think of any keyboardist who can match his chops. The man could play circles around Kevin Moore. However, Jordan Rudess is not a master of composition. This guy is a weapon, and his skills have to be utilized while curbing his excesses. Unfortunately, Dream Theater was coming off of the difficult Falling Into Infinity sessions in which they were forced to write in a more commercial vein and as such they were in the mood to wank and wank hard. Thus, JR is allowed to run free and run away with songs. My main source of irritation with this album is how overextended and useless so many of the solo sections are. \"Beyond This Life\" has, for my money, one of the most annoying wank-sections in the DT catalogue. From the Zappa-esque goofy soloing, to the nearly two-minute trumpet-patch keyboard solo abortion, to the fact that this monstrosity has burst Alien-like from the carcass of a solid piece of speed metal business it makes my brain hurt. And look away, please, from the tuneless hell of cut-and-paste instrumentalist clinic \"The Dance of Eternity\". Six absolutely worthless minutes you will not get back. Not to mention the fact that it follows about five minutes of equally worthless and pointless wankery at the end of the initially flawless \"Home\". This isn't Jordan's fault, Portnoy and Petrucci are equally culpable.\n\nBesides doing harm to the individual compositions they infest, these faceless solo sections also make the album a long, tough slog through its near eighty minute run time. By the end of the end of the thing great portions of the album will probably seem blank, great expanses of time that are as brown and dead as the album's cover. The recurring riff phenomena that was exploited to such perfection on Awake here becomes another anchor as I remember the first maybe 150 times I listened to this album I couldn't for the life of me remember, for example, whether \"Fatal Tragedy\" or \"Beyond This Life\" came first or even be able to instantly tell which was which.\n\nThat said, a few positive words are in order as I do quite like a lot of the record. \"Overture 1928\" is a tight, melodic instrumental without a trace of fat and some great axe-work from Petrucci. \"One Last Time\" is a stunning piano-driven ballad (Jordan is absolutely wonderful on the piano, by the way), and it begins the trilogy which ends the album is a grand way. \"The Spirit Carries On\" is a slightly cheesy Floydian ballad (file next to \"Silent Lucidity\") with a great performance from LaBrie and a very nice solo from Petrucci. \"Fatal Tragedy\" is a rock-solid fast rocker (save for its hideous, out-of-place melodic chorus) with one of the few great long instrumental sections on here. And hey, it feels nice to be praising John Petrucci's solos because it becomes pretty slim pickings over the next three LPs. After this they tend to fall into two categories: tuneless shred and cheap melodic solos that border on self-parody.\n\nIn the end, Scenes has a solid handful of good-to-great tracks and even the bad tracks usually have some redeeming qualities. I used to rank this album considerably higher, but the fact is this thing hasn't aged all that well. It is markedly more consistent than follow-up Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, but that album just feels more fresh and its high points resonate more with me than the best Scenes has to offer. If I were to venture a hypothesis to explain this, I would have to suggest that it is frustration that robs me of the enjoyment of what is great here. I'm damned frustrated by the subsequent efforts too, but this is the one where the train of thought really ran off the tracks and so it rings melancholy to these ears. Missed opportunities, lost talents...\n\nOur deeds have travelled far\nWhat we have been is what we are\n\nTrue... and yet...\n\nStand-Outs: \"Home\", \"Finally Free\", \"One Last Time\"\n",
        "\nOctavarium. The 8th album from Dream Theater. I understand that the old sound is gone, where some dont. I understand that they rock out a lot more as well. I understand they have chosen to stay with The Glass Prison-esque production sound for a while. I understand they are not as progressive as they once were (although if you think about it, they've progressively gotten less progressive haha)\n\nWhat I dont understand is how they made such a great album to follow Train of Thought, which was good because they made a 'heavy' album, they needed to. But to move on from that is just great. Another TOT wouldve sounded monotonous. One thing that makes this album stick out from the rest is the useage of dark elements in the music.\n\nThe music here is very diverse also. There's the rock out song in The Root of All Evil, which also follows the AA series of Mike Portnoy. Although the chorus is very melodic and insanely dark. \n\nAfter a portion of the 2nd passage of the title song, the song moves to the ballad The Answer Lies Within. I was bummed when I first heard it because it just followed a great uptempo song. But the song itself is great, it has grown on me. Mostly piano and James.\n\nThese Walls is great. After I almost stopped the CD when I heard Korn type of riffing, the song exploded into what I like to hear from DT. The atmosphere is amazing. This atmosphere of being in a dimension of 0G's with stuff floating around. Very memorable.\n\nI Walk Beside You sucks because it is Dream Theater. I Walk Beside You is the next #1 hit because it's U2.\n\nPanic Attack is where the band held onto their TOT style for a song. Except I think this song would blow anything on TOT out of the water. It's so heavy and fast, very unlike most DT songs. James' falsetto use is amazing as well, wish he used it more in this song.\n\nNever Enough is Muse, yes, but I like this song because the chorus just kicks so much ass. Very melodic and dark.\n\nSacraficed Sons is where the epic part of the album begins. It deals with 9-11, but the focus is really on the music more. When you consider the big instrumental break, you kinda forget what the song is about. Speaking of the instrumental break, Dream Theater, meet Megadeth ala Rust in Peace. Thats what it sounds like (coincidence theyre touring together?) Then they move to probably the best riff on the album. The one thats mixed with the orchestra and a whole shitload of pinch harmonics. Back to the chorus and one more time with the best riff and you have a great epic.\n\nSpeaking of great epics, a greater one follows. It is the title track. this 24 minute monster is magnificent. There are 5 passages with lyrics and i believe 8 all together. Makes sense with what Romulus141 mentioned about the 5:8 connection with this album.\n\nThe first passage is the darkest section of the entire album. Starts with effects ala Pink Floyd, explodes, then moves to really dark acoustics with flute. James' singing has never been better. The focus is mainly James and Petrucci's acoustic.\n\nThe second passage begins with Myung with a great bassline which flows through most of the passage. Melodies from this passage are heard throughout the album by the way. The 'chorus' of this passage is just so beautifully projected.\n\nPassage 3 begins the pickup of the song. It is one of the 3 non-lyrical passages. A nice keyboard line that really caught my ear when I first heard it. The rest of the band just begins rockin out for a while.\n\nAfter that, it moves to the 4th passage which is the full circle section. James' vocal line follows the keyboard for a while. Another 'chorus' type part here which is really memorable as well.\n\nThe fifth passage (again more irony, being the fifth) is the 'prog' section if you will. This is where Petrucci, where he held back on leads and wankery on most of the album, finally gets his chance to fucking let loose and create one of the most maddening sections of a song I've ever heard from a DT song. There are moments where parts of other songs from past albums are used for a second. Finally, the song becomes so chaotic, you can't believe it's the same song as the first 2 passages. From insane solos, to a part of Jingle Bells, to some Spanish guitar work for like, 7 seconds, this section is the most fun.\n\nThe 6th passage the climax. It's chaotic much like the 5th, but with lyrics. This time, James gets to let loose, except he hasnt held back this album, he's held back for the past 4 albums. A final scream is held out while screaming \"trapped inside this octavarium!\"\n\nThe 7th and 8th passages are similar. They feature the orchestra but the 7th is with lyrics and a bit darker.\n\nThe 8th is instrumental and is the falling action of the song. I find this to be the masterpiece section and is so epic and chilling. I get chills everytime i hear this part. Being a classical fan myself, I enjoy the final notes with the whole orchestra, like the french horn thing at the end. The orchestra sounds like one youd hear in the 50's or something. Unbelieveable song and unbelieveable album.\n\nPoints off for I Walk Beside You. This is essential DT, no matter what anyone else says.\n",
        "\nThis is probably DT's least known album. I dont know why exactly, maybe cause the singer is not James. Maybe cause of the production, which isnt bad when you consider when this album came out (I just dont understand why the guitars are so hard to hear when Petrucci palm mutes). Probably the best thing about this album is that the songs are progressive, but they arent drawn out like a lot of DT songs are in later albums. The songs here build up, are really upbeat most of the time and energetic, basically they get to the point. There's no overlong solos aka Train of Thought. The instrumentals are also very well constructed.\n\nA Fortune in Lies starts the album. I had the unfortunate luck of hearing the live version from Live at the Marquee with James Labrie singing first. He took the song to a new level and the song is a little faster. The album version is good though, but I personally prefer that live version.\n\nNext is Status Seeker. This song is SO 80s. The chorus and the overall sound itself are all 80s. An average song though overall.\n\nNext is the highlight, The Ytse Jam. Fucking Christ this is the best prog instrumental since YYZ. The opening riff is both memorable and exciting to listen to. It goes through the arabian sounds ala YYZ at some times with some great solos. The bass here is also very audible, I enjoy the plucking sound John Myung gives off.\n\nThe Killing Hand unfortunately follows. The guitars are ok but Charlie is just whining when he sings here. This is like those 80s ballads at times as well. The song picks up along the way but I find it hard to like this song. This song would be alright if it had James singing it.\n\nLight Fuse and Get Away. I laugh at this title everytime I see it. With a title like this, you'd expect a rapid fire type of song (no pun) Just lots of speed. This is better than the Killing Hand but I also think it gets boring fast. The lyrics are kinda dumb too. I'm not much to care what the lyrics are about, unless it's a cool subject which then makes the music the more greater.\n\nAfterlife starts with some cool riffs with keyboards messing around. When you think it's gonna build up real well, it doesnt, and keeps going. This has a nice atmosphere to it, but lacks the energy found on the other songs. Reminds me of the more melodic songs Rush has done.\n\nThe Ones Who Help to Set the Sun takes too long to get going already. This is a disapointment of a song when compared to the rest. DT has long songs, but they usually starts out right away, or within a minute, this takes over 2 minutes to kick in. The song is alright and is kind of a preview for following DT albums.\n\nFinal song is Only A Matter of Time. This is one of the best songs on the album, and reminds me of Images a lot too. Great intro and full of power, which is also what the song is about. This, Ytse Jam, and A Fortune In Lies are the best songs here, the rest are ok.\n\nThink of this album as one step before the sound theyre known for. The music is so free and it sounds like everyones enjoying what theyre playing. This is the most case for bands when they start out, because they are younger and the musical drive is at its strongest.\n\nGet this album if you dont have it, even though it's a different vocalist. You may have noticed, I rarely mentioned him. I tune him out a lot here, and when you do, you'll probably enjoy the music more. Because it's a shame a lot of people dont even know about this album.\n",
        "\nNow here's an album for which my appreciation grows every day. Look beyond the strange, malnourished production (which I might add, sounds great when you crank it) and the emphatically un-James singer and you'll find one of the coolest damn debuts in metal history. This is insane, intricate, thoughtful, and theatrical power metal of the highest order, a progged-out feast for the ears and mind as these hyperspeed technicians bounce around the studio totally unencumbered by such concerns as restraint and maturity. Unlike later overburdened and underthought platters like Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought, When Dream and Day Unite combines bohemian wankfest excess with structures that support, nay, demand their existence and melodies that pulsate with life and a burning heart full of love for fast, epic heavy metal.\n\nThis is like the culmination of early Queensryche and Fates Warning, combining the speed and frightwigged over-the-top neoclassical assault of 'Ryche (think the Queensryche EP or an amphetamized The Warning) with Fates' mist-shrouded mood, complex and bent structures, and overarching impression of size and power. \"The Killing Hand\" is a damn near awe inspiring example of how to take somebody else's characteristics and then blow them out of proportion and make them into something new and exciting. The blistering solos seem oddly weightless, keys and strings dancing through the night sky as if gravity were no concern. Other than one oddly disconcerting moment where we drop out of a truly amazing riffset into a melodic interlude, this song is a perfect example of how to build tension through dynamics. We've got a delicate intro, big-time power chords, epic vocals over acoustics, start building up the intensity, and then... riffs, riffs, glorious handfuls of golden riffs being tossed around willy-nilly while Dominici skulks around the laboratory mixing strange fizzing chemicals and cackling wildly.\n\nThe really effervescent thing about When Dream and Day Unite is how fresh all of the players are. Here's Kevin Moore experimenting with his canny atmospheric work, his regal leads, and of course his majestic and buoyant melodies that will soon bloom into the joyous conglomeration of Images & Words in which he is omnipresent and unforgettable. There's John Myung before producers and band pressures toned him down, providing an unshakeable rhythmic foundation but also playing some of the best bass leads I've ever heard. Seriously, the man is absolutely all over the neck here, refusing to be shunted aside by the traditional lead instruments and doing some jaw-dropping stuff whenever a space opens up. Mike Portnoy, bless his heart, cannot play a wrong beat. Even early on, in spite of the complexity of his play the guy had a great sense of feel and he manages to make his presence known without grandstanding quite as much as he does on later recordings. Check the solid stomp of \"The Ones Who Help the Sun\" (some of the coolest sounding kicks I've ever heard), the excellent little drum solo in \"Ytse Jam\", or the schizoid time changes in \"Light Fuse and Get Away\". And last but not least, Mr. John Petrucci on skullfrying axe-work. This stuff is passionate, headbangable, memorable, and unique and frankly, puts the similarly note-dense Train of Thought leads to shame. Every song has an incredible solo spot, from the swinging guitar heroics of \"A Fortune in Lies\" (absolutely godly shredding) to the \"Afterlife\" unison (along with that 'can do no wrong' riff, absolutely spot-on Shea), or in \"The Ones Who Help to Set the Sun\" where the usual shred showcase seems to go up and up until it explodes and surrounds the listener with shimmering notes aplenty.\n\nOh, I didn't mention the singer? Well, Charlie's excellent. His voice is willowy as hell and he partakes in one of DT's cheesiest moments \"I am the killing haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...\", but otherwise the guy does a hell of a job with the material. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdStatus Seeker\" features some extremely passionate delivery, and the man brings life to some really difficult stuff such as Moore's hyperverbose \"Only a Matter of Time\" and \"Light Fuse\", as well as the bizarre fandango-thrash of \"A Fortune in Lies\". I grant you, his voice takes some getting used to and lacks force, but you couldn't ask for more emotion or sincerity than this guy provides. And hell, he's aged better than LaBrie has if the When Dream and Day Reunite DVD is any indication.\n\nOh, and I should add that lyrically this album is excellent. Although it is a bit stilted and leads to some interesting choices melody-wise, this is some cool poetry and leads to some really memorable lines. In general, obscure lyrics own the hell out of blatant, unimaginative lyrics. I'm looking at you \"Endless Sacrifice\" and \"The Answer Lies Within\".\n\nBefore I close this review out, I'll go into a little depth on the best track on the CD which is \"Only a Matter of Time\". While the first seven tracks on this album represent a strange proto-Dream Theater that would only sporadically pop-up in later years (\"A Change of Seasons\" is the last of the major Fates Warning influence, for example), \"Only a Matter of Time\" is a test-flight for the shining ebullient epics all over the next album. It begins with a brilliant symphonic keyboard introduction, almost like a fanfare, that gradually fuses with an aching guitar which dovetails nicely into the beginning of the first verse. It is on this song that Moore really defines the role of keyboards in Dream Theater's music. On previous tracks, he is a force and plays an important role in the song but on \"Only a Matter of Time\" he becomes a dominant force. Moore is absolutely everywhere, weaving brilliant melodies and breaks around his own amazing lyrics. This is a storehouse for some brilliant riffery, each verse given a different riff and vocal phrasing, constantly growing better and better as it rushes towards the massive outro with its imperative keys seeming to scream that time is running out on this stupendous record... the only thing I can about this song is that sometimes it is absolutely breathtaking. And so is this record.\n\nAlthough they sometimes express some disdain for this record and these songs, and while it is emphatically the least popular Dream Theater record amongst fans, When Dream and Day Unite ranks as one of their absolute best works and is a must for any power, prog, or straight-up heavy metal fan. I tend to stay away from such recommendations, but this record has to face apathy from the band's fanbase and the lead weight of being released under the Dream Theater name, which might bar those who would get the most out of it from giving it a shot. This album rules.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Only a Matter of Time\", \"A Fortune in Lies\", \"Light Fuse and Get Away\"\n",
        "\nThis year has been quite the triumphant one for progressive music thus far. Outstanding showings from relatively unknown acts like Dynamic Lights, Presto Ballet, Russell Allen\u2019s Atomic Soul, and Shadow Gallery have all posed a certain potential of gracing 2005 Top Ten lists, however, the league\u2019s heaviest hitter has unfortunately struck out this time. The band we all expected the most out of, ends up delivering the least. Some would say that the Dream Theater discography has been on a gradual decline in quality since 1997\u2019s Falling Into Infinity \u2013 For me, they have only failed to hit it out of the park once or twice, but Octavarium is strike three for the quintet.\n\nThere are specific characteristics that I have come to appreciate about Dream Theater, and those elements scarcely surface on Octavarium. As the disc touches briefly on some of the groups past offerings, this is unquestionably Dream Theater, yet there is something missing. The band has no trouble writing remarkable songs, but somehow they just don\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s almost as if they let their egos go on vacation, and during their time apart, decided to write a modest record. I have news for them; there is no place in progressive music for reserve. Over the top and out of this world is the very essence of what this scene is all about. Bluntly put, go all out or go home! Easily the tamest Dream Theater release to date, Octavarium draws closest comparison to the previously mentioned Falling Into Infinity and Metropolis II: Scenes From A Memory, but with far less complexity and edge. In the end, the album more or less takes a few steps back, stunting the band\u2019s ever evolving sound \u2013 progression ceases.\n\nBeing that this is Dream Theater\u2019s eighth full-length release and finds the band revisiting various points of their career, there really couldn\u2019t be a more appropriate heading for this record than Octavarium. It\u2019s possible that there is some other underlying significance behind the title, but I\u2019m just pointing out the obvious. There are also eight compositions presented, leading us into the proverbial track by track breakdown and album highlights segment of this chronicle.\n\nOctavarium begins with \u201cThe Root Of All Evil\u201d, a song that appears to be the conclusion to a trilogy that began with \u201cThe Glass Prison\u201d from Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence and continued on Train Of Thought with \u201cThis Dying Soul\u201d. James Labrie even rehashes a few pre-chorus vocal melodies from the latter, but essentially fails to leave the same lasting impression. \u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d offers superb orchestration and has an overall mood much like \u201cAnna Lee\u201d or \u201cHollow Years\u201d, taking us back to the Falling Into Infinity connection once again. Dream Theater are beyond proficient songwriters and \u201cThese Walls\u201d is not only the highlight of the album (with more technicality and catchiness than the rest), but also one of my favorite works of their entire existence. Swimming in a sea of mediocrity \u201cI Walk Beside You\u201d and \u201cPanic Attack\u201d stand to be the least appealing of the eight tracks; the former sounding like it was taken directly from the Maroon 5 \u2018Book Of Achieving Airplay\u2019. Coming in a close second place is \u201cNever Enough\u201d, probably best described as a heavier James Bond theme song. Packed with great melodic riffs and passages, this cut could have easily worked as the main theme for The World Is Not Enough. Closing the album is the title track; a mammoth twenty-four minutes of nothing special. This behemoth of a song starts out exceedingly slow and never really picks up. Known for lengthy compositions, Dream Theater have yet to match (in my opinion, of course) the grandeur of \u201cA Change Of Seasons\u201d, and they certainly don\u2019t succeed here.\n\nWhile Octavarium successfully showcases the band\u2019s ability to craft emotive music, again it feels too underplayed (if that makes sense). Also the songs are not quite varied enough to host such lengthy run times. More than five or six minutes is too much, but most are around eight and above. Let\u2019s face it, Dream Theater fans are an eclectic bunch with their own opinions and tastes and longtime admirers will purchase this album despite what anyone has to say about it. You will do the same.\n",
        "\nThere are some bands people just need to shut the fuck up about. Even\nthough two of my favourite bands are about as guilty of overhyping as Dream Theater are, no one shoves Roger Waters or David Gilmour's greatness down your throat, not like they do John Petrucci or Mike Portnoy. People will shove the technicality involved with Petrucci's method and use it as an excuse to like their music, ignore a plethora of better bands like Spastic Ink. At any rate, I don't necessarily hate Dream Theater so much as I hate their fans. I enjoy them, just in relatively small doses. So, I get \"Octavarium,\" their eigth release, with eight tracks(Dur-hur magosh they am so smart), which I'm confident in saying is a mixed bag straight down the middle. Even beyond that, I still have a few complaints about the CD.\n\nCan't get too hung up on being generally annoyed with the fans, though. Dream Theater are without a doubt a band that has some massive technical talent, but regardless of what most people have claimed, I sense a very noticable lack of songwriting talent. Yes, they've had their moments of catchy hooks and memorable riffs, but I can barely listen to three songs from the entire Dream Theater catalogue in successive order without getting bored, and \"Octavarium\" is really no different. It's all Progressive Metal that in the end goes completely nowhere, which doesn't really mend the fact that they're a band with relatively blunt teeth to begin with. I mean, there comes a point were Metal needs to have that aggressive edge. Twenty-five per cent of this CD isn't heavy, at all. So, what's so fucking Metal about it? I mean, \"The Answer Lies Within\" has a nice concept, \"Let's put a slow, acoustic piece on this CD.\" In the end, it barely changes in it's five-minute runtime, manages to completely bore me for the entire length, and on top of that, promotes transcendentalism, an idea that's been dead for a reason: it doesn't work. But hey, I guess they didn't have literary courses at Berklee, eh James LaBrie?\n\nOh, right, Octavarium. Clever play on words.\n\nLet's not rule out the existence of the other gamete of songs that bore, \"These Walls\" falsely gives you a whammy-downtuned opening that makes any typical person think, \"Metal.\" Bzzt. Wrong. Petrucci just gives you typical power-chord rhythm and let's the synth go into effect, which at least manages to be memorable. +1 Dream Theater. I didn't get to mention the relatively boring, \"Let's attempt to be heartfelt, even though we've done the same sound several times before on our other CD's\" verse that sounds like it was inspired by \"Welcome Home(Sanitarium),\" ironically another overrated song. Dream Theater -1. The song seriously sounds borrowed from an array of radio-rock bands. Dream Theater -1. More pointless, witless lyrics. Dream Theater -1. Solo I could play with my left nut(That's the undeveloped one). Dream Theater -1. \"I Walk Beside You\" also follows in the generally same manner of being completely boring, it sounds like the latest Indie Jam with better drumming. Honestly, Portnoy manages to pull off some very catchy drumming here.\n\nWhat did most of those songs have in common? Most of them weren't Progressive at all. Aren't Dream Theater Progressive Metal? Yeah, 'Dream Theater just don't like being labeled!' Dream Theater must not like making coherent music, either!\n\nNow, those aforementioned tracks and \"Sacrificed Sons\" pretty much make up the boring tracks on the CD, leaving you with the obvious ones left, even though a good portion of \"Octavarium\" is useless as well. The CD falsely starts strong with \"The Root of All Evil,\" which along with \"Panic Attack\" makes itself one of the most memorable two tracks on the entire CD. It's a good deal heavier than most of what's on here, and has a fairly obvious theme. Dare I mention Dream Theater's stance on music downloading and point out the hypocrisy, though. LaBrie manages to pull off some memorable and catchy vocal lines, although the chorus sounds a bit lacking. \"Panic Attack\" starts out with a maniacal and depressive bassline, then rushes in some fairly heavy guitar and drum meshing that builds momentum it doesn't quite execute, easily setting itself as the heaviest song on \"Octavarium.\" Excellent orchestral piano melody, as well.\n\n\"Octavarium,\" the title-track, clocks in at nearly twenty-four minutes, but has alot of excessive and unneeded additions to it; some that just seem to drag along. For instance, nearly the first four minutes of the song is a solo that's supposed to be heartbraking, depressing or whatever on top of some ambient synth. Then, after it starts to bore you, Dream Theater amplify the volume, and build some fairly large momentum, and BAM. Nothing happens. Just like sex with a chronic masturbator, they popped their load a looooong time ago. Of course, that's not saying that the acoustic section is horrible, because it's not. It's actually the highlight of the entire CD, and sounds a lot like something I'd hear if Pink Floyd and Eric Clapton decided to do music together. I feel like it's all for naught afterwards, though. Relatively boring rhythm while LaBrie goes back into pseudo-introspective mode. Myung then starts indulging himself in some funky bass moves, while Petrucci delivers some likable guitarwork in conjunction with Rudess providing continuous piano. Again, it starts to get repetitive and then Dream Theater mend it falsely with an unneeded electric section where the only thing that changes is the amplification. Luckily, though, Rudess saves the day with a quirky, yet highly addictive synthesized section and Petrucci providing some finally competent rhythmic action. Finally, Petrucci initiates active mode. A solo with Rudess's often weird, circus-y synth involvement. Petrucci manages to cover a lot of relatively wide ground here, constantly switching mood and sound, form electric to acoustic, from frenetic to beautiful, all without losing a single lick of momentum. Now, this is what all of Dream Theater needs. Just as Petrucci was shining, LaBrie fucks ALL his shit up. I don't want to hear some midget yelling \"TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM!\" after some epic guitarwork. It's not even a real word, or feasible geometric concept. Could've at least done TesseracT a favor and mention something 4-dimensional, but he could've said it twice for added intelectual effect. No, I'm not being serious either, but read some of the ravings about Dream Theater, it'd fit right in. Anyway, the CD ends on a fading guitar solo, adding to more of the excessive amount of music that could've spared me having to be so bored.\n\nEven then, though, I'm still bothered. Dream Theater are supposed to be Progressive. Where the fuck is the Progressiveness? \"Octavarium\" was the only track that showed a noticable amount of progressive structuring and songwriting, and a lot of the time, it was just false-build up one after another, or they jumped into a verse that they really could've done without. Not to mention, if they're so Progressive, why do I feel like I've listened to this exact same CD before? Y'know, John Petrucci might've wowed me for three CD's at most. Portnoy might've sounded like a complete monster for a few more; two at most. There's a point where so much technicality(Which outside of the title-track seemed nowhere to be found on the CD) would've fucked Dream Theater over by eventually not being that surprising, then leaving people to realize that as a songwriting unit, Dream Theater fail horribly. Trying to headtrip us? Failed. Trying to create some momentum? Failure again.\n\nDream Theater are Metal for easily entertained Metalheads when it boils down to it. This band has become uninteresting, and now they're just running on pretentious, false-intelligence so Metalheads with a superiority complex can have their flag-ship band, though they tend to think of Meshuggah as annoying, leaving Tomas Haake's obvious intelligence(The guy is an English Dictionary, and he's Swedish) unnoticed or never mention Ron Jarzombeck. Maybe other people need the cohesiveness Dream Theater have as well.\n\nYou may let in the sharks now.\n",
        "\nOn June 7th, Dream Theater's Octavarium, their 8th studio album, was released to the general public for consumption. Thanks to the magic of the internet, I found the leak of the album that appeared a little over a week before the release date. So, I've had the opportunity to digest this album in its entirety before most of the standard fanbase. In addition, I have purchased the official release, as the leak was not the final mix, and I have given that a full listen as well.\n\nRegardless of your point of view towards Dream Theater's newer material, I think that most would agree with me in stating that Octavarium is an important release. The previous release, Train of Thought, put a lot of fans and critics on edge, as it seemed that the heavy, excessively long songs filled with long, arguably pretentious (and borderline pointless) solos were going to become the norm. I don't agree with all the sentiments that the public expressed, but I do consider Train of Thought to be their weakest studio album. The album was a one-time experiment that succeeded about 75% of the time. The solos/instrumental breaks were frequent and sometimes didn't contribute to a song's integrity (see the unison instrumental section with John Petrucci and Jordan Rudess in \"In the Name of God\" for a good example, or the extended solo section of Honor Thy Father), and some songs felt like extended sections were tagged on for length's sake (see the last two or so minutes of \"This Dying Soul\"). All in all, Dream Theater established a new set of fans (particularly those with tastes in the heavier side of music), but alienated a good deal of their older fans. This puts Octavarium in a position of \"Do or die.\" Dream Theater is aware of the criticisms that Train of Thought met. They weren't deaf (in fact, as the song \"Never Enough\" states, they were sometimes downright offended by the ignorant flak some fans spewed in their direction), and from listening to Octavarium it seems like they were eager to address the concerns the fanbase brought up.\n\nIn order to prepare myself for reviewing this album, I went back to listened to each and every studio album released by Dream Theater, one a day, up until the official release date. What I found interesting was how much their sound changes just from album to album, and how much Images and Words does not sound like When Dream And Day Unite, and that Awake sounds nothing like Images and Words, and so on and so forth. Furthermore, I noticed that the \"wankery\" that Dream Theater is accused of didn't truly surface until Scenes From A Memory, and didn't become relentless until Train Of Thought. Out of all the albums, I experienced some bad cases of boredom on Train Of Thought (especially during the later half of \"Honor Thy Father\") and even on Scenes From A Memory. As I expected, I enjoyed Awake, Falling Into Infinity, and Images and Words the most, with When Dream And Day Unite surprising me (I had never \"listened\" to that album properly, now I see some of its own magic) and Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence getting an honorable mention. When Dream And Day Unite and Scenes From A Memory are easily Dream Theater's most bombastic albums, while Awake and Falling Into Infinity I find to be their most personal. Images and Words is magical and epic, like its not of this world.\n\nI did a lot of research on Octavarium before it was even released. I listened to the early radio edits. I read nearly everything the band had to say about this album. I knew what I was going to listen to. I understood the direction they were going to take. When I listened to the full album for the first time, I was expecting a mix of Falling Into Infinity, Awake, and to a lesser degree, Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence, plus whatever new spins Dream Theater would pull on this album. Guess what, I heard exactly what I planned on hearing. It helps to be informed, understand the direction the band is going in, and to prepare yourself for what you will hear. It helps the appreciation process a lot.\n\nLet me be blunt. If you dislike all of Dream Theater's material after Images and Words (and probably even Awake), you won't like Octavarium. Dream Theater is not going to return to that sound, and to expect them to do so is absurd. This record still sounds like the version of Dream Theater that was established on 1999's Scenes From A Memory after Jordan Rudess joined the band as their permanent keyboardist. On the flip side, for the individuals that thought Train of Thought was one of Dream Theater's best albums, and that their earlier work is not as interesting, then I will say that they will probably be under-welmed by this effort. A lot of the elements from their past three albums are absent, and replaced with some sensibilities that haven't been seen since Falling Into Infinity. What is the point I am trying to make? Approach this album with an open mind. It is not supposed to be part two of any of their previous albums. It is the next iteration of Dream Theater, and it takes some elements from their past, ditches others, and then introduces variety and influences that have not surfaced in Dream Theater's music up until now.\n\n\n\nNow that the stage has been set, how is the album itself? I think that \"variety\" is probably the best word to describe this record. I haven't seen this range of variety since Falling Into Infinity. There are the metal songs, there is a ballad, there are a couple of hard rock inspired songs, and then there are a couple prog epics that the band is famous for. It essentially covers every base, meaning there is something for everyone on this album. They wrote these songs in the studio over the course of a month and a half I believe, and given that they took their time and put constraints on themselves, the end result is diverse and focused.\n\nDream Theater, for example, forced themselves to write some songs that weren't extended in length (much like Rush did at one point in their career). Those songs include \"The Answer Lies Within\" and \"I Walk Beside You.\" Other songs break the five minute mark, but are much more concise in what they state musically. \"The Root of All Evil,\" for example, is a continuation of the AA saga by Mike Portnoy that started with \"The Glass Prison\" back on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. This is the first song in the series that does not break 10 minutes. Unlike \"This Dying Soul,\" it does not feel like the song meanders pointlessly. Instead, it is a focused effort that continues the AA saga and references the past songs to produce a enjoyable atmosphere.\n\nFinally, the first seven songs are all written in different keys. \"The Root of All Evil\" is in A, \"The Answer Lies Within\" is in B, \"These Walls\" is in C, and so on and so forth. In Octavarium, it once again starts with the key of A, and ends on A. This artistic idea is creative, and further serves to give all the songs their own identity. \n\nNow for the contributions of the band members.\n\n\nJohn Petrucci - I applaud Petrucci as he showed restraint. This is the first album since Falling Into Infinity where he crafted solos that did not blaze at a mile a minute. It shows a sense of discipline, and the quality of the songs grew due to this. Petrucci also utilized some low tunings on this record to produce a soundscape that hadn't been explored previously. With all this said, shred-fanatics need not fret, as Petrucci really lets things rip on \"Panic Attack\" and \"Octavarium.\" Petrucci created some catchy riffs this time around in songs such \"The Root of All Evil,\" \"These Walls\" and \"I Walk Beside You.\" Other times, he utilized an acoustic sound in \"Octavarium\" to create a different type of atmosphere. All around, a solid effort by Petrucci.\n\nLyrics Penned: The Answer Lies Within, These Walls, I Walk Beside You, Panic Attack, Octavarium (Sections I and V)\n\nMike Portnoy - Of all the members, he showed the least \"change.\" In other words, the drum work on this record is the typical Mike Portnoy affair. Like Petrucci and Rudess, he shows restraint where it is proper, such as on \"The Answer Lies Within.\" Portnoy likes to borrow heavily from his influences, so for example there is some Muse-like drumming in \"Never Enough.\" The effect of Portnoy on this record is not so much in a change of drumming as it is in the creativity of the songs. He and Petrucci are the main songwriting team, and it shows. The overall song-feel is the more modern, post-Kevin Moore sound that was \"perfected\" (depending on how you view it) on Scenes From A Memory. He does some very nice bass kick work in the chorus of \"These Walls.\" I don't recall any crazy solos however, like at the end of \"Finally Free\" in Scenes From A Memory. No big loss though, the drums are not supposed to overpower but to support the overall rhythms of each specific piece.\n\nLyrics Penned: The Root Of All Evil, Never Enough, Octavarium (Sections III and IV)\n\n\nJohn Myung - It's nice to hear Myung once again. Poor Myung has always been lost in the mixing process, and could only be appreciated in the live CDs. But, now he has been given the space to breathe, and his work is phenomenal. He does a nice, complicated riff at the beginning of \"Panic Attack\" that sounds effortless and holds a riff for an entire sub-section of \"Octavarium.\" This man is a monster on the six-string bass. Impressive work. It's a shame that he doesn't contribute lyrically anymore, but the band refuses to work around his writing style nowadays, and the man shouldn't have to compromise.\n\nLyrics Penned: None\n\nJordan Rudess - Probably the most controversial member of the current version of Dream Theater. His keyboard sound effects, continuing with this record, sound nothing like Kevin Moore's or Derek Sherinian's. But, to be fair, he toned down the bombastic nature of his sound effects this time around. He sticks to more organic sounds (and even a sound effect that sounds like a tribute to Ayreon!), and introduces the wonderful sounding instrument called the continuum in \"Octavarium.\" As far as his solos, they are still shred-inspired, but they are limited to where they are called for, such as in the solo section of \"Panic Attack\" and \"Octavarium.\" I must say though that his ballad-piano work in \"The Answer Lies Within\" surprised me, as I didn't think that he was capable of writing such a melody line. Well done Rudess. His other piano work (as in piano sound effect) is the standard neo-classical affair that we've come to expect. But, much like Petrucci, its more restrained and focused on increasing the strength of the song as opposed to using it to show off. In this record, Rudess got the opportunity to show his artistic chops in a variety of ways, and it came off as classy. An effective use of talent by Mr. Rudess.\n\nLyrics Penned: None\n\nJames LaBrie - The other controversial member, as most people either love or hate him. Let me just say \"wow!\" I knew that he had been reworking his singing style ever since the Train of Thought era (essentially, he got a new vocal coach that said his old coach's techniques were bullshit, so he needed to \"start\" all over again), and the result of this is magnificent. His range is starting to once again reach the heights he achieved in Images and Words, and there is a greater warmth is his tone and expression. I really can't see how his voice can be perceived as annoying on this recording. He doesn't sound like he is straining himself anymore. Instead, it is a true joy to listen to his range and expression. Given the overall soundscapes explored, the music compliments his timbre well. He uses doubling and tripling of his vocals to achieve harmonies that simply haven't been heard on a Dream Theater record before (they have appeared on his side projects, however). James LaBrie's showing is one of the greatest strengths of this album, and this seems to promise an incredible set of performances on this upcoming tour to promote Octavarium.\n\nLyrics Penned: Sacrificed Sons, Octavarium (Section II)\n\nFinally, the song breakdown:\n\nThe Root of All Evil (9/10) - The opener of the album, and the continuation of the Alcoholics Anonymous saga that began with \"The Glass Prison\" and continued with \"This Dying Soul.\" I love the intro into the song. It starts off with the final piano note from \"In The Name Of God,\" Rudess creates an atmosphere with his sound effects (reminds me of being stuck in a thick liquid) that reminds me of the very end of The Human Equation by Ayreon, and the rhythm of the final riff in \"This Dying Soul\" is pounded out by Portnoy repeatedly until the first main guitar line starts. As it stands, this song is the least metal of the three entries in the AA saga so far. It's more hard rock inspired, and that's quite fine. The main riff is catchy (and reminds me of the color blue for some reason), and yet sounds at home with the previous sonic themes from the other entries in the saga. Speaking of which, \"This Dying Soul\" is openly referenced in this song, and makes for a very cool, haunting effect. No, Dream Theater is not running out of ideas and needs to reuse their old songs, this piece is a continuation of a much larger suite, and it is only appropriate that certain lyrical and musical themes are reprised now and again. It was done in \"A Change Of Seasons\" and \"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence,\" why not here? Overall, a great rocker and an excellent way to start the album.\n\nThe Answer Lies Within (8/10) - The main ballad of the album, and it is the simplest one that has been released. This is much along the lines of \"Anna Lee\" in that it is heavily piano driven and quite intimate in its emotions. Some beautiful and melodic lines are played by Rudess, and Petrucci eventually joins him acoustically. The song is moving, and the lyrical theme presented is uplifting, as opposed to the dark subject matter of \"Anna Lee.\" LaBrie has song warm moments on this track, especially at the \"you're gonna shine\" lyric, which gives me chills. There are no solos, which is appropriate. This piece is sincere and warm, and a solo would just spoil the mood. Unfortunately, because this song is slow-moving, one may be inclined to skip it from time to time. Unlike some of the other material on this record, this is not a piece that fits into the \"listenable in any mood\" mold.\n\nThese Walls (10/10) - The first of three Dream Theater classics on this album. I've been listening to this song ever since the radio edit was released, and it never gets old. The song is an excellent mix of heavy and soaring sounds, and the result is an uplifting song that has \"balls.\" The chorus is memorable, possibly one of the most memorable they've ever written (considering the fact that a number of their songs don't have a discernable chorus). As mentioned before, I also like the bass kick Portnoy uses during the chorus. Petrucci's solo is one of the most minimal that has come from him, and it works quite well in the context of this piece. It helps to drive the piece into its final moments, and doesn't distract the listener. The vocal effect that LaBrie uses at the end with the lyric, \"Tear down these walls for me / It's not too late for me\" is neat, and makes me feel happy inside. Despite the depiction of struggle that manifests itself over this song, it is clear that in the end things will work out, and LaBrie's vocals really help to portray it. This is one song I can't wait to see live.\n\nI Walk Beside You (8/10) - The first of two songs that are clearly inspired by a rock band. This song is quite U2-ish in its construction and in LaBrie's vocals. This is probably the poppiest thing Dream Theater has released on a studio album (aside from \"You Not Me,\" but that song was a general failure), but you know what? I like it. For once I'm not feeling like I need to pay attention to the technicalities of the song. The song is written in what appears to be D Major, and that gives the song an uplifting feeling. I remember smiling broadly when I heard the familiar tick tock from Scenes From A Memory at the beginning, followed by Rudess's staccato keyboard hits and going into the melodic opening guitar licks from Petrucci. This song reminds me of \"Innocence Faded\" in some ways. It's uplifting, not overly complicated, and LaBrie gives an impassioned performance. This is a feel-good song that I know can make my day feel better. I take this song for what it is, and why it was written as it was, and that's that.\n\nPanic Attack (10/10) - This is one of the greatest metal songs by Dream Theater. It completely blows everything from Train Of Thought out of the water. It has heavy guitar tones, but the keyboards are not obscured, since Rudess does not try to sound like a second guitar this time around. The piano bits with the chorus sound effect remind me of the more memorable parts of Scenes From A Memory. LaBrie gives an aggressive performance, and even mimics the singer of Muse near the end. The solo section is awesome, and actually feels like it belongs versus being inserted for the hell of it. The heavy riffs are given time to develop, and are utilized as a repeating theme throughout the song. This is THE song I want to see live. This is a serious contender for my favorite heavy song from Dream Theater.\n\nNever Enough (7/10) - Before I had the lyric booklet and understood what this song was actually about, I remembered being a little disappointed with this one. This song sounds a lot like Muse's \"Stockholm Syndrome\" in the opening guitar riff. LaBrie even uses the same type of vocal distortion that is found in British pop rock acts such as Muse and Radiohead. So, out of everything on this album, this sometimes feel a little bit like a rip-off. However, the second half of the song saves itself, and I love that echoed-type sound effect Petrucci uses in his solo. Now, since I know that this song is about Portnoy's encounters with ungrateful fans (and I mean fans who verbally abuse his work without explanation, who constantly ask him to release things and then bitch when it's not to their expectations, and who chew the band out for not playing a certain song at a three-hour concert or say stuff like, \"Train Of Thought was a fucking stupid idea\"), the whole use of the British art rock style makes a lot more sense. Radiohead in particular has always been subtle musically when it comes to their anger towards society, and typically they juxtapose very angry lyrics over beautiful musical passages. Dream Theater does something similar. The music itself is not all that angry, particularly the verse parts. It's more haunting, and I feel that the band was taking a stab at masking angry lyrics with, more or less, standard non-angry art rock music. Does it succeed? More or less. Now that I know what its about, at least I understand why it sounds like it does, as opposed to just being a rip-off. It's still my least favorite song on the album though.\n\nSacrificed Sons (9/10) - Classic Dream Theater mini-epic right here. Opening with a middle-eastern twang, the song then builds into a quiet melody line. The vocal lines are haunting, and the solo section is of the traditional Dream Theater style. The build and pace of this song reminds me of \"Peruvian Skies\" in many ways, including the fact that both songs make me feel the same emotions and \"colors.\" Dealing with sad subject matter, it ponders it for a while, breaks into a solo, and then turns metal and brings the song to an energetic close. As far as the lyrics go, they deal with 9/11. Yes, I know this is going to make some people uncomfortable, and some others angry that they even tackle this subject at all (either because they should \"forget about it\" or because they see it as overtly \"pro-American,\" which I don't see at all). I feel that James LaBrie, the writer of the lyrics, handled it in the best way he could. It is obviously his first person account of how he felt about the whole situation, and he is NOT condemning the middle east. He is condemning the perpetrators for perverting their scripture and for sacrificing their own sons to achieve their own twisted end. It's \"Sacrificed Sons,\" not \"Evil Terrorists.\" \"In The Name Of God\" dealt with fringe cults in America in a more general sense, this deals with James LaBrie's personal feelings about the tragedy. He just didn't have the opportunity to do so until now.\n\nOctavarium (10/10) - The closer of the album, and what a way to end things. A word of advice: just because this song is the same length as \"A Change Of Seasons\" doesn't mean you should expect ACOS part two. I did that, and I was sorely disappointed the first time around. This song sounds nothing like ACOS. So, on my second listen, I choose to listen to \"Octavarium\" instead of ACOS part two, and it that made the song click for me. The orchestra has some beautiful accents to Dream Theater's composition. Overall, this is probably the most majestic thing Dream Theater has created (I mean this from a beauty aesthetic). The song is just beautiful to listen to. Jordan's new device, the continuum, sounds great, and adds an atmosphere to the song that has never been heard on a Dream Theater album before. This epic is a nod to progressive rock from the 70s, and develops as such. In other words, this song is one HUGE crescendo. It just builds and builds as we move from one movement to the next. The solo section, when it finally kicks in, begins to build a sense of chaos that, up until this point, had been relatively absent from the song. The end of the build occurs with James LaBrie SCREAMING \"Trapped inside this Octavarium!\" over and over, which gives me the chills, something that I hadn't experienced since 'The Crimson Sunset' movement in \"A Change Of Seasons.\" As for the scream, some have expressed distaste towards it for whatever reason. My response is to get open minded. The song has been building for twenty minutes, reprising themes from the entire album, and then you say a scream at the climax is \"unwarranted?\" It's a perfect release of tension, and from the music's aesthetic, not much else would have fit. Seriously, it's not a death metal growl (which I happen to like anyway), and its no different than the screams that were overlaid in \"In The Name Of God.\"\n\nAnyway, back on the song. Lyrically, it deals with a man who, as a child, wanted to live his life to the fullest, but didn't end up achieving that. He then falls into a catatonic sleep, and awakes to find out that he lost thirty years of his life. After that point, it looks like the song breaks from this story a little bit, and gives a laundry list of words that have a slew of messages in it pertaining to Dream Theater, progressive rock, and persons and events from the past thirty years or so. So actually, one could interpret that this is all the stuff that this man has missed, and it is flooding back to him. Unfortunately, it seems like he fell back into his catatonic state, and (this part is pure conjecture) Octavarium is the next thing he hears. Each of the previous seven songs are recapped, and it is revealed that he is trapped inside an octavarium, a series of eight songs, eight notes available in an octave, and that these notes flow in a perfect circle. The song closes with the ideas of coming full circle, and ending exactly where we began, which is exactly how Octavarium closes, with the opening sound effects from \"The Root Of All Evil.\" Wonderful song, and an awesome way to close the album.\n\nAlbum Themes - One thing this album has is a lot of hidden messages and \"easter eggs\" within the packaging and the music itself. Musically, this is something that hasn't been done since Awake (I don't count Scenes From A Memory, since that is a concept album and the style demands it), and it was something I was delighted to see return. It encourages replaying (especially with headphones, as some things will not be caught otherwise) and it really drives home the fact that artistically this is an album, not just a collection of singles. Although the songs stand alone, they are still connected in some way. I will not delve into some of the more obscure bits and pieces, as some of it is just mere speculation, but I wish to drive home the artistic merit Dream Theater has created with this album.\n\nThe first thing that I immediately noticed is that bits and pieces of melodies from songs are played in other songs. You can hear the \"medicate me\" melody riff in the background in \"The Answer Lies Within.\" I know that other riffs from \"Octavarium\" appear in the other songs. In addition, this album seems to reference Dream Theater's past albums in some ways. There are footsteps at the beginning of \"The Root Of All Evil,\" a tick-tock sound in \"I Walk Beside You,\" and a guitar squeal in \"Sacrificed Sons\" ala Scenes From A Memory. A couple piano lines in \"Octavarium\" and \"The Answer Lies Within\" give me a serious \"Anna Lee\" vibe, and I don't think that's an accident. In movement four of \"Octavarium,\" you can hear Portnoy say faintly in the background \"root,\" \"second,\" \"third,\" etc. as each two line sentence is recited by LaBrie, followed by a brief clip of the song that lyric refers to. \n\nThe 5:8 connection is found a lot in the artwork. The eight refers to the eight notes to go a full octave, there are five black piano keys and eight white keys in an octave, this is the band's eighth album with five members (and eight total members have gone through the band since they've been in the studio), there are five birds and eight balls on the cover, with the birds in-between the ball where the black keys on a piano would be. There is a five point star in an eight-sided building. Finally, there is the circle of fifths, which is how the eight main letter scales of the western world are formed. Basically, this kind of stuff is all over the booklet, and is probably encoded in the music somewhere (I wouldn't be surprised if a melody line follows the circle of fifths somewhere).\n\nThe album deals with coming full circle, and ending where you begin. The album goes from lyrically upbeat songs to lyrically upset songs, to a song that encompasses it all, only to have it all recycle again with the next listen. Much like life, we go through these feelings in stages. We never escape them, and we continue to realize that a lot of life goes through cycles.\n\nIn conclusion, as can be gathered, I was extremely happy with how this album turned out. It's the most artistically engaging thing they've released since Awake, and it feels much more personal than the last three albums. I know this album will be meeting a lot of flak, for a lot of people were probably expecting something completely different. I got exactly what I wanted. This is the album they said they were making, and what we have is a diverse, focused, mature effort that drops some pretenses in order to advance the art of songwriting. Screw the fact that most of this album is not prog. What does a genre matter anyway? Good songs with artistic integrity can be found in rock, metal, prog, electronica, etc., and this album is full of them. This is a new direction for the band, and for me I feel like they finally hit the mark in the Rudess-era. What will their next album hold? I have absolutely no clue. The previous albums held small clues as to what the next album would sound like (\"The Glass Prison\" on SDoIT and a few moments in \"In The Name Of God\" and \"Vacant\" on TOT), but I can't pick out any of those clues this time around, perhaps because of the great diversity this album holds. Whatever it is, you can sure as hell bet that it will sound like nothing that came before it.\n\nGreat effort Dream Theater, I look forward to hearing this stuff live.\n",
        "\nAfter the severely bashed Train Of Thought album (I actually enjoyed it myself) this album is the most important album Dream Theater have had to put out there since Scenes From A Memory which saw a new keyboardist in tow. \n\nThe Root Of All Evil - The next part of the Mike Portnoy AA saga. A good rocker to start the proceedings with John Petrucci and James LaBrie standing out in particular. The only downfall being that as far as the music is concerned this song does not match up to that of The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul however, I feel that the lyrics for this song were much better written than the other two. Give it time, it grows on you. \n\nThe Answer Lies Within - Some nice poignant lyrics written by John Petrucci but this will be everybody's least favourite track on the album simply because of one thing - it's bland. The music does not match up the lyrics. I think Petrucci wanted something similar to the outstanding Disappear on the Six Degrees album but it just does not work. \n\nThese Walls - And there it is! The first absolute gem coming from this album. This song for me is completely flawless, great lyrics, great musicianship, Jordan's keyboard work during the chorus is of an excellent standard and James is singing on sheer top form. Amazing song. \n\nI Walk Beside You - Most people will instantly label this with U2 but I feel there is more of a Coldplay influence in there (Coldplay also released their new album on the 6th of June along with Octavarium over here! Conspiracies a-plenty! :p). I actually really like this song but the fact it comes straight after a song as strong as These Walls makes it seem somewhat out of place. \n\nPanic Attack - Some immense riffage starts this one off. This is another gem in this album with the band rocking out Train Of Thought style BUT (and this includes These Walls) they know the boundaries with the heaviness this time. \n\nNever Enough - Muse, Muse, Muse, Muse, Muse. It's all you hear which is fine but if you actually look at who wrote the thing then you'd see the name \"Mike Portnoy\" who also stated at the beginning of the year that he thought Muse's \"Absolution\" is the best album released since the year 2000 onwards. Therefore it would be a tad understandable if there was a Muse influence present. This is NOT a rip-off, the band have been accused of this many times, it's getting old guys, give it a rest eh? As for the song itself, it's actually quite good and given a chance it's actually one of the better listens on the album. \n\nSacrificed Sons - Before I review this song, there also is plenty of people on the bands website saying writing about 9/11 is just old now. If they actually READ the lyrics then you'd notice that 9/11 is only used as a reference in a song written about terrorism. This is James proving that he can indeed write some great stuff (Blind Faith and Disappear prove this point) with some moody keyboards supplied by Jordan. Very epic and more importantly, extremely good. \n\nOctavarium - This is it. The epic. This song is worth buying the album for alone. Clocking in at a gargantuan 24 minutes exactly (multiply 8 by 3 and you get 24, spooky eh? :p). There's something altogether extremely sequential about this song. The very last lines being 'This story ends where it began?' and then the opening moments of the album actually being the closing moment also. What does this signify? \n\nAll in all, this album is extremely solid and up there with Dream Theater have responded to their criticism extremely well as they did with Scenes From A Memory. If you are a keyboard and vocals man then you will have a field day as Jordan and James are the shining stars on this one, which is actually really good as they are normally overshadowed by the three founding members. A special mention has to go to Petrucci though who wrote 4 complete songs and two parts of Octavarium, does Petrucci perhaps feel the strongest about the bands fate? \n\nIn terms of the significance of the Octavarium - does this mean Dream Theater will call it a day? This is after all their 8th album and the Octavarium is complete. Does it perhaps mean that Dream Theater are moving on to pastures new? A new style? Also, this is their last album for Atlantic so maybe it means the band is undertaking a new challenge by following the likes of Korn and (ironically enough) John Petrucci by self-releasing their albums? I certainly hope we find out soon, this band is too good to just disappear.\n",
        "\nWell.....I can't tell you how much I wanted this album to be great, for this to bring Dream Theater back to the progressive spotlight, for them to do something new.\n\nBut, after listening to it many times, I think Dream Theater is a dying band. They're devoid of new ideas, and most of the members seem to be too caught up in how great they think they are to realize it.\n\nThere are several issues that plague this album. One of these issues is the production. John Petrucci's guitar sound on the albums has been getting worse ever since he got the Music Man as far as I'm concerned. I wasn't a fan of the guitar sound on SDOIT, although I love the album, and the guitar wasn't awful. However, on this, it sounds pretty bad. The production is also very muddy, not acceptable from a Dream Theater album.\n\nThe next thing, stale instrumentation. John Petrucci has apparently acquired a fetish for down-tuning his guitar and playing generic power chord riffs. That's what a lot of the playing on the album sounds like, which is unfortunate, since we know he is capable of so much. Another stale bit is Jordan Rudess' playing. \"The Answer Lies Within\" is what I would call one of the \"good\" songs on the album, but the keyboard is so stale. He's not even trying to play outside the box, just playing quarter-note chords. How boring coming from Jordan Rudess.\n\nThe other issue with instrumentation is soloing on the album. There are only two worthwhile solo sections on the album, the one in \"Octavarium,\" and to a lesser degree, the one in \"Sacrificed Sons.\" I laugh every time I hear the solos in \"Panic Attack.\" John Petrucci isn't even trying; he's just doing random guitar exercises. Jordan's solos also sound uninspired on this. It sounds like they just said \"oh yeah....I guess we should stick a solo in there.\"\n\nThe whole \"dark\" sound is another issue. Dream Theater just can't do it without it sounding like epic radio rock. This power chord writing, and then the verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure is very boring. So a lot of the songs they end up coming out with a generic song that could have gone through it's musical variety in under four minutes, but they drag it out to eight. The other problem with this is that the vocals suffer. James LaBrie can't do the dark vocals, but they paint him into that corner, using the lower range over a heavy backing, and he sounds mediocre at best. His best performances are in the non-downtuned songs here.\n\nThe ripping off is something I shouldn't have to hear from Dream Theater. While there are Muse inspired moments on the album, \"Never Enough\" is a complete rip-off of Muse. I'm not a Muse fan, but I was alerted to this by someone else. The U2 chorus on \"I Walk Beside You\" is also a rip-off, but the rest of the song doesn't sound like that, so it's not as big an issue. The point here is not whether it sounds good or not, but that it takes no though at all to rip-off another band.\n\nThere are some good moments here. \"Sacrificed Sons\" is straight from Scenes From A Memory, which if not totally creative, is better than the more generic things on the album. The best track here is the epic title track, \"Octavarium.\" Lots of interesting melodies (compared to the generic melodies they use in the \"heavy\" songs), a nice solo melody, great vocals from James, and the nice addition of a string ensemble for the emotional ending. An excellent song. This is what they should be doing more of here.\n\nI'm not saying there is anything wrong with \"heavy\" songs. Dream Theater have some really great, tasteful heavy songs that aren't just generic radio-rock fests......all the seven-string songs on Awake, \"The Dance Of Eternity,\" etc. But this is just generic material. Especially \"These Walls.\" It's just a seven and a half minute radio rock song.\n\nSo here is my track list from best to worst, and notice the mediocrity line.....although for Dream Theater, it should probably be the line where it's not worth listening to.\n\n1. Octavarium\n2. Sacrificed Sons\n3. I Walk Beside You\n4. The Answer Lies Within\n---mediocrity line---\n5. Never Enough*\n6. Panic Attack\n7. The Root Of All Evil\n8. These Walls\n\n*Never Enough is good as a song, but the fact that it is a complete rip-off of another band means that it doesn't have much musical value.\n\nTo conclude.....this is a good album. It has a few great songs, and some good songs. However, this is not a good Dream Theater album at all. It's not \"progressive,\" it doesn't introduce anything new, and with the exception of one song, they can't even go back to their old sound, so it's not even a nostalgia trip. There are quite a few points where you can hear the \"progressiveness\" trying to poke its head out, but those moments don't outweigh how thoroughly generic a good portion of this album is. I'm buying this album.....but unless they can pull themselves out of the gutter this might be the last Dream Theater album I can buy. Sadly, I don't see them bringing it back up because they don't seem to be able to take criticism or see any negative things about what they're making. As many know, 'Elements Of Persuasion' was originally distributed masquerading as Octavarium. Well, this album isn't too far removed from that heaping pile of garbage, but it's worse in principle just because this is Dream Theater making this. Remember what they can do? Well....this isn't it, they're holding back. If it weren't for the title track, this probably would have gotten a thirty. Even though there are some really nice moments here, especially in the \"good songs,\" from a musical perspective, it's generic and clich\u00e9. This is what it sounds like when a good progressive band decides to do radio rock.\n\nBuy it for Octavarium, the great song, and for the couple of other \"good\" songs.\n",
        "\nWhere to begin\u2026\n\nDream Theater is back.\n\nBack from the nebulous wastelands of conflicting musical identity that were Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence and Train of Thought. Neither of these two were bad albums, per se, each having their moments of brilliance, but neither matched up to the impossibly high standards the band set for themselves with Images and Words, their second album, and Awake, the third. But Octavarium is lightyears ahead of their last few mixed-bag releases, taking the best elements of their evolution in style and musical ability, with an infusion of a new passion, and doing away with the rest: the wastefulness, the questionable songwriting, and (critics of ToT, breathe a heavy sigh) the rap. Even the album\u2019s one reference to Train of Thought, the chorus to \u201cDying Soul\u201d played during \u201cRoot of All Evil\u201d, sounds better in the new context of Octavarium.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I enjoyed both of Dream Theater\u2019s previous albums, having never been one of DT\u2019s \u201cdisenchanted fans\u201d, but they lacked the magic that was strongest with IaW and was never seen to such a degree again. Until now. Octavarium has the magic again. It is brilliant. It is a masterpiece.\n\nA part of the problem with the previous few albums was their emphasis on the album as a whole rather than the songs, and as a result some of the songs are rather weak. Octavarium shifts this focus onto the invidual songs, tightening up the lyrics, doing away with needless instrumentation, and bringing a diversity unseen since IaW. The songs flow better internally, and thus the album flows better as a whole. A new addition is the few seconds of \u201csoundscaping\u201d between each track that ties them all together, and interesting concept that makes everything flow together despite unrelated subject material.\n\nThe new album kicks off with \u201cRoot of All Evil\u201d, the continuation of the Alcoholics Anonymous saga begun on SDOIT, and is probably the strongest of the three. It makes an awesome album openener, with a kickass drumline (a reference to Dying Soul) leading into a doubly kickass riff that holds the song together without ever getting old. The song is a real rocker that holds your attention from start to finish, unified and cohesive, and features some awesome (but tasteful) soloing by Petrucci and Rudess. The chorus is a showcase for Labrie\u2019s New Improved singing, which is tighter and better than on any previous album and shows just how much he has improved as a singer. The next two heaviest songs on the album, \u201cPanic Attack\u201d and \u201cNever Enough\u201d, are both excellent. \u201cPanic Attack\u201d opens with possibly the catchiest riff on the album, if not in DT\u2019s entire discography, and tears into a blazing fast cacophony that perfectly invokes the emotions of its lyrics and title. Once again we find very nice vocal work by Labrie, especially during a little falsetto bit on the bridge that reminds me in all the best ways of Queen. \u201cNever Enough\u201d is an odd song stylistically for Dream Theater, reminding me more of The Muse, and at first I didn\u2019t like it for the chorus\u2019s lyrics, but it grew on me quickly.\n\n\u201cThe Answer Lies Within\u201d is the album\u2019s ballad, a strangely uplifting acoustic song that makes a perfect break after the rockin\u2019 intensity of \u201cRoot of All Evil\u201d. Rudess and Labrie dominate this one, and it\u2019s one of their best soft songs, up there with Silent Man and Disappear (although lyrically and thematically the opposite of the latter). It features some very nice violin work and heartening lyrics such as \u2018You\u2019ve got the future on your side\u2019. It transitions into \u201cThese Walls\u201d, the catchiest song ever written in a major key, and a huge radio hit if they do it right. Radio hits? An oddity for Dream Theater, but one that reminds me of Images and Words, and that\u2019s a good thing. \u201cWalls\u201d has an awesome chorus and some sweet key harmonies, and despite being an extremely simple song for Dream Theater it is excellent nonetheless. The final of the album\u2019s lighter songs is \u201cI Walk Beside You\u201d, a song that could only be a tribute to U2, with some Muse influence mixed in, and just as good as any of the best that either could have written. Catchy, poppy, but I love it nonetheless.\n\nBut just for those who would complain about Octavarium\u2019s not being \u201cproggy\u201d enough, DT threw in the final two, beastly tracks: \u201cSacrificed Sons\u201d and the title track. \u201cSons\u201d starts out slow and sad, building up through a heavy instrumental section into an awesomely heartbreaking melody and a haunting orchestrated outtro. It has lyrical ties to \u201cIn the Name of God\u201d, featuring themes from 9-11\u2014the title is about partly about the reverence for fanatical suicide in terrorist culture, and partly about the war in Iraq-- and has some of the best vocal and guitar work on the album. \n\nFinally is the album\u2019s beast, \u201cOctavarium\u201d, a track that picks up slowly but surely builds intensity throughout multiple musical landscapes until the chilling ending, a lyrical summary of the album that ties everything together. The lyrics are bit out, the rhythm frantic; this is Dream Theater at their most intense and emotional, and every time James Labrie bites out the words \u201cTRAPPED-IN-SIDE-THIS-OC-TA-VAR-I-UM\u201d in a half-scream, it sends chills down my spine. The song then closes with a melodic outtro that reminds me of some of the best work Kansas has done. Throughout the song, there are references to classic rock and Dream Theater's own work; the reference to Nightmare Cinema (DT's \"alter ego\" band from the FII era) was especially subtle and amusing. Dream Theater fans have asked since 1995 if they could manage an epic that would compare to A Change of Seasons. They have, and while Octavarium is a different song, it is just as surely a prog masterpiece.\n\nIs it Images and Words? Musically, no- it reflects every stage of Dream Theater\u2019s evolution since then. But it features everything that made IaW an amazing album: great songwriting, varied music, technical ability, melodic playing ranging from beautiful to haunting to rocking\u2014and blends in everything Dream Theater has learned since then. It is easily one of their best albums, and a classic for the ages.\n\n\"We move in circles, balanced all the while, on a gleaming razor's edge, a perfect stand: colliding with our fate, this story ends where it begins... I'VE COME FULL CIRCLE.\"\n",
        "\n\"A Change of Seasons\" -- the song -- is a hugely awesome, 23+ minute progressive metal epic that will bring you to your knees. Running the gamut from slow, more melodic sections to full-on metal onslaughts, this is Dream Theater's masterwork, their greatest creation. The many moods and colors of the song give all five of the band members room to display their enormous instrumental chops. Just one album later, much of their music (especially LaBrie's singing) would become cheesy and overdone, but everything is perfect here -- Dream Theater's last big hurrah. No metal collection or progressive rock collection is complete without this landmark recording.\n\nThat said, the rest of the album is disappointing. It consists of four live tracks, all of them covers. The first is a medley of two Elton John songs. Of the live tracks on the album, this one works the best because the original song is so different from Dream Theater's style that they have plenty of room to make it their own song. The next track, a cover of Deep Purple's \"Perfect Strangers,\" is decent, but it doesn't do anything to expand on the original version. Everything here is a weaker version of the original Purple recording. The song has become somewhat of a live standard for Dream Theater, so in that sense it is fairly interesting, but this is really for fans only.\n\nThe third live track is a medley of three Led Zeppelin songs that simply pales in comparison to the originals. They took three songs that are metal/hard rock classics and played pale tribute versions of them. Led Zeppelin, especially Plant and Page, had such distinctive and unique styles that it is impossible to try to imitate them, and Dream Theater certainly doesn't do a very good job. The last track, however, is the weakest of the album, a huge 10+ minute medley of classic metal/prog tunes such as Queen, Genesis, and Pink Floyd. This may be interesting to actually see live, but on record it is horribly boring, and I would rather just make a playlist of the original versions and listen to that. Furthermore, their choice of songs is questionable, especially the Journey song. Journey? Come on.\n\nSo my rating gets docked for the live tunes, but let's not forget the power and importance of the progressive masterpiece that is \"A Change of Seasons.\"\n",
        "\nSo here we have Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. It's one of the first Dream Theater albums that I bought, and remains a favourite to date. However, like most Dream Theater albums (with the exception of Awake), it tends to be pretty controversial within the fanbase - there's a pretty distinct split between those who consider it an experimental progressive masterpiece, and those who think it's little more than hyperextended wankery. Personally, I think it rocks to the point it puts many other albums to shame.\n\n\n\nTrack 1, The Glass Prison, starts off where Scenes from a Memory left off - with what sounds like it's meant to be a downpour of rain, but could equally just be radio static. A bell tolls, and a catchy yet haunting riff builds up, instrument by instrument, steadily growing heavier, until the kickdrums come in, and you can tell the track's gonna be a rocker. And that's pretty much what it is - a solid, heavy track. Makes for a pretty hard-hitting opener. James LaBrie's vocals are great and well varied throughout the track, there's some impressive bass work, the drumming is excellent - the keyboards are the only instrument which don't particularly shine as much in this song, but that's okay, Rudess gets a lot of time to show off later on in the album. The lyrics are great, too: Mike Portnoy's went from the guy who didn't write any lyrics whatsoever for the first two albums, to probably the best lyricist in the band. This is the first of his songs on the subject of the Alcoholics Anonymous twelve-step program, which continues through This Dying Soul in Train of Thought, The Root Of All Evil in Octavarium, and onwards.\n\nThen, we move onto something very different. James LaBrie provides the lyrics to Blind Faith, a moody attack on religious zealotry. From the first few seconds of the fade in, you can guess this isn't going to be anything like The Glass Prison. It begins quite mellow, with a lot more keyboard influence than TGP had, and far less guitar - that's a distorted six-string bass you can hear Petrucci playing, there. Eventually, it builds up to a more heavy (but still keyboard-focal (and still awesome)) sound, as the chorus comes in, which it maintains in varying degrees until the outro. Around the five minute mark, James LaBrie stops singing, and you're treated to quite possibly the best instrumental section in any Dream Theater song, featuring Petrucci and Rudess taking it in turns to outsolo each other. This is definition kickass, and probably the high point of a great album. A brilliant song, one of Dream Theater's best.\n\nAs Blind Faith fades back out, the acoustic-sounding, heart-felt introduction to the pseudo-ballad Misunderstood begins. It continues in much the same vain for a while: soothing and melodic, before building up to a contrastingly heavy chorus, and ditches the soothing feeling for a haunting feel to it. Anyone who thought they were in for a mellow track after three minutes of the song should have learnt their lesson better from Blind Faith: Misunderstood is probably the darkest song on the album. Unfortunately, two minutes from the end, it spoils what was a great song with some horrible... noise. There's no real way to describe it, other than noise, it's dreadful. They'd have done better leaving it out, but at least the rest of the song is a masterpiece.\n\nMoving on, The Great Debate also builds up to its main contingent pretty slowly, but not in the same mellow yet listenable way as Blind Faith or Misunderstood does. Instead, it begins with an overly stretched-out section of modern keyboardy sounds upon a bass line, with samples over the top presenting both sides of the argument against stem-cell research, making great use of the pan. It's extremely dull, so if you want to listen to it all the way through, I advise listening to at least the intro with headphones, as that's the only way this intro is going to be even vaguely interesting. However, once it does build up, this is, musically, exceptional. It's well-orchestrated, melodic, heavy to a certain degree, interesting, and generally extremely listenable - the keyboard and guitar taking equally dominating roles. The lyrics leave a little to be desired, but they're not as cheesy as some make out. The vocals aren't nearly as good as LaBrie is capable of, and the first few lines would have been much better without the robotic vocal effects. The drumming compensates for that severalfold, however. I'll say it straight out: the drumming in this song is unmatched by anything else on this album. Apparently, there's a lot of Tool influence in them, but not being a Tool fan, I'm in no position to confirm. Eventually, it goes into a pretty kickass keyboard solo, followed by a less kickass guitar solo, and closes with what may as well be the intro played backwards. This song probably should have been only nine minutes long, but hey, the bits which aren't unyielding torrents of samples kick sufficient ass to make it an enjoyable track.\n\nDisappear is a song which I always tend to group with Misunderstood in terms of general feel. It took me far too long before I began to appreciate it, however. It starts out with some creepy-sounding effects, followed by a haunting keyboard line, before progressing - quite suddenly - into an acoustic ballad. Unlike Misunderstood, however, this song won't turn around three minutes in and become a heavy track. Which, I must say, I appreciate - this song is absolutely beautiful. I didn't appreciate it at all, originally, but now that I've got used to it, it's the perfect closer to the first disc.\n\n\n\nDisc 2 is all a single song, though it doesn't really feel like one. In spite of the often less-than-subtle transitions, however, it's a pretty kicking disc.\n\nOverture is just what it says on the package, an overture. It's slightly... odd for an overture, though. As opposed to the traditional approach, in which the riffs are almost identical to how they're presented in the song, they've designed it to sound extremely orchestral and classical in nature - and they did it quite well, too. It's a majestic opening to the CD, and fits quite well. Eventually, it builds up to a climax, and the beautiful piano intro to About To Crash enters. And, About to Crash is a great song, it was one of my favourites for a very long time; Rudess' piano ability fits in perfectly, and it's harmonious all the way through. It begins with quite an optimistic feeling to it, but gradually becomes more sinister, fitting in perfectly with the subject matter of the lyrics - a bipolar girl. It's a great track, one which I'd kill to hear live.\n\nWar Inside My Head is a song about a man mentally scarred by war, and sounds the part, too. It launches with an intimidating, guitar-driven intro, before LaBrie sings a short verse, followed by a kickass call and return chorus, between Portnoy and LaBrie. Followed by another short verse, followed by another short chorus, followed by The Test That Stumped Them All. It's a catchy song, and near impossible not to headbang to, but... where's the length? Totals two minutes, about a minute of which consists of intro. Still, the guitar's awesome, the drumming's top notch, and it flows well - I love this song. I'd love it even more if they wrote an extended version of it, however.\n\nThe Test That Stumped Them All has a slightly hysterical feeling to it. It's fast and heavy, but the vocals at the \"We can't seem to find the answers...,\" etc. verses are kinda irritating. That said, the instrumentation is good, and it's a damned good song, all in all. The instrumental section at the end sounds excellent; it fits the rest of the song far better than that at the end of, About to Crash, say.\n\nGoodnight Kiss' first half drags on a bit. The intro takes a little too long, but once you get into it it's got a lot of feeling to it, and it's not exactly dull. The first solo is quite heartfelt, and then, a little over halfway through, the pace changes for the instrumental section, to an extremely kickass darker, faster section. The drum sets a good, foot-tappin' (:P) pulse through it, which flows perfectly into Solitary Shell.\n\nSolitary Shell is a pretty damn cool song, with a good mood, and makes for a more calm, collected interlude. The instrumental break at the end has something of a latin vibe to it in places, and doesn't quite fit with the rest of the song. It's probably the one part of the album I'm least familiar with, it sort of becomes background noise until the intro to About to Crash Reprise comes up.\n\n...which, might I add, rocks. The guitar intro sounds great, the keyboard roll sounds great, and it's got a great feel to it - far more optimistic and fastpaced than ATC was even at the start. A bit shorter, but that's excusable. The instrumental section towards the end almost unravels the overture from the start; you can hear sections of War Inside My Head in it, and it's in much the same style. It only lasts two minutes, however, before making the final transition between songs.\n\nLosing Time is just plain beautiful. It's a mellow, touching close to the disc. The lyrics are stunning, the best on the disc, and the instrumentation is majestic, tying back to Overture extremely well. The lyrics to the Grand Finale are slightly cheesy, but it builds up great, and the gong is the perfect climax to mark the end of an exhilarating album.\n\n\n\nIn all, this album gets a 93%. The awesome bits outweigh the imperfections (and let's face it, every album has a couple) by a long mark, and there really isn't a single song (or track, should I say) I could say that I'm unsatisfied with. Worth every penny.\n",
        "\nSo this is the album that started it all. I\u2019ve read other reviews and heard opinions of your average metalhead, and I\u2019ve become truly disappointed towards everybody\u2019s apparent disillusion to this album. First of all, it is their first album, the one that later became essential for them to evolve in the complex amalgam of music they are known worldwide for. The songs are somewhat repetitive, but after hearing it so many times one cannot help but to fall in love with this CD. \nFrom the majestic intro of \u201cA Fortune in Lies\u201d, one feels a special connection with the music, as if John Petrucci and Kevin Moore were playing their solos and extremely demanding melodies right in front of you, and especially for you. The 80\u2019s style of \u201cStatus Seeker\u201d is relaxing, and the chorus is catchy and nice. The famous \u201cYtse Jam\u201d has such killer solos, with intriguing time signatures and crazy melodies, that one could think it rather belongs in \u201cImages and Words\u201d or \u201cScenes From a Memory\u201d (Very probably the two most virtuoso DT albums as to \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d). \u201cThe Killing Hand\u201d has an emotive guitar intro, followed by a very epic song with very difficult vocals and hidden bass solos (Of course, we DT fans would not know the definition of \u201cepic\u201d until hearing the ambitious \u201cA Change of Seasons\u201d and later on the 42 minute giant \u201cSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence\u201d). Followed by that is \u201cLight Fuse and Getaway\u201d, another song with a catchy chorus and rather intriguing key signatures. In this song, you can really hear their influence for ideas of songs such as \u201cScarred\u201d and \u201cLearning to live\u201d. After that is the aggressive \u201cAfterlife\u201d, with marvelous religious lyrics (somewhat corny in the chorus though) and very intricate guitar and keyboard solos. Following is a song with a beautiful intro, which rather reminds me of \u201cWait for Sleep\u201d, but a certainly mediocre rest of the song. The vocals need more emphasis, and the way the drums start is rather abrupt and awkward. The last song, \u201cOnly a Matter of Time\u201d, is in my opinion, the BEST song in the album overall. The chorus really portrays magnificence and beauty, and the keyboard solo is absolutely enchanting. It is a truly superb work of art by this admirable quintet, and the fact that it is played much later in \u201cBudokan\u201d is simply captivating and enthralling. \nOverall, Kevin Moore\u2019s feeling is fascinating and delightful, John Petrucci\u2019s solos are assassinating, Portnoy\u2019s drums are complex and interesting to listen and Myung\u00b4s bass, although difficult to hear because of the recording, boasts fast, complicated solos sometimes. Charlie Dominici\u2019s vocals, although somewhat weird and too light, were not exactly a walk in the park and are something he should be recognized for still today. After all, his legacy was left for James LaBrie to personalize and therefore repair. Overall, a must for DT fans and anybody interested in the bec\u00bfginning of modern progressive metal.\n",
        "\nFor some reason, I am both very pleased and somewhat at odds with Dream Theater\u2019s new album. On one hand, they have ditched the excessive mallcore and aimless wankery for a more progressive album. On the other hand, a lot of this album seems contrived, as if the band went into the studio with the purpose \u201ccreating a diverse album.\u201d Usually, this is a recipe for disaster, but in this case DT manage to pull it off unlike their last contrived effort to make \u201ca classic metal album,\u201d Train of Thought.\n\nThe album starts very solid with The Root Of All Evil, which provides themes from the better sections of Train of Thought\u2019s This Dying Soul as it is a continuation of the AA saga. The riffs in this song are genuine (un-nu-metal), and there is an amazing keyboard break as well as a highly solid Petrucci solo. To its credit, the solos don\u2019t take over the song, and there is some great piano at the end. The energy of this song transitions nicely into The Answer Lies Within, which is one of contrived ballad songs that seems to have been written for the purpose of variety. It\u2019s catchy and unusually simplistic for Dream Theater. Overall this track doesn\u2019t offer much. Interestingly, this song also has no instrument solos, a rarity.\n\nThese Walls is a varied tempo catchy song with heavy and softer sections, keyboard melodies, a lot of hi-hat and stax by Portnoy, and a very interesting guitar solo that actually stays within the confines of the song (4:40 to 5:10). The keyboard melodies have a New Millenium vibe, but overall the song has a vibe like the Awake album. Track 4, I Walk Beside You, begins with an eerie passage that turns into a fairly mainstream U2-like rock song. There is a cool key change near the end, and again \u2026no solos.\n\nPanic Attack is another heavy track full of keyboard scales, 5/4, catchy melodies, crazy solos, and time changes. The next track, Never Enough, is the most interesting for DT. It is very highly influenced by the British rock band Muse, but DT puts their own virtuostic spin on it. Musically, this track is very busy and has some excellent soloing. The following track, Sacrificed Sons, is based on 9/11. It starts out much like a ballad, but around 4:15 it breaks into a classic DT instrumental section full of scales, key changes, and soloing. This section is includes orchestral accompaniment, and while it\u2019s long, it doesn\u2019t turn into a wankfest. The vocals come back in after this break with a much heavier background than the first 4:00 of the song.\n\nThe final track is the big wow. Obviously an attempt to create another A Change of Seasons with the 24:00 running time, it doesn\u2019t have the honesty that ACOS possesses, but it\u2019s a great song in itself. There are all sorts of prog influences here from Yes to Pink Floyd to ELP with more orchestra. The song begins very slowly with the vocals in a story format and doesn\u2019t really take off until after 12:00 at the simply amazing musical interlude. After 18:00, the vocals come back in spoken and slowly build up to a scream unlike anything Labrie has ever done before.\n\nOverall, unless you\u2019re already a Dream Theater or progressive fan, there is little chance that this album will draw your attention. With 2 softer songs and other's with softer sections, only 3 of the 8 tracks can consistently be considered metal, but this album is much more in tune to what Dream Theater is all about. I recommend it to everyone, but don\u2019t expect anything \u201ctrue.\u201d \n\nBest tracks: The Root of All Evil, Never Enough, Octavarium\n",
        "\nDream Theater, to many, have been in a downward spiral since 1997's Scenes From a Memory, and to some, have been spiraling downward ever since their second album Images and Words. The trend stops here. 2005's Octavarium shows us yet another array of styles that Dream Theater can take on and perform successfully. The songs are much less meandering (save the 24 minute title track) and are much more to the point, yet still have that progressive touch. Petrucci plays a much angrier guitar than we have heard from him in the past. Rudess plays a MUCH bigger role in every song now. This album is one of the best showcases ever of how to correctly use keyboards, something I feel they failed to in their other albums, where Rudess was mostly limited to his spacey solos and minor background parts. Myung takes on one of the best bass tones I've heard in a long time, although he is still hidden in the background for most of the album, much like every other album (Again, save the title track, where he holds together an entire section with an amazing bassline) Portnoy is Portnoy, we all know what he can, and does do.\n\nMost importantly, and the biggest surprise is James LaBrie. The very critiscized vocalist has EASILY the greatest performance of his career on this album. He displays an amazing array of styles, range, and actually sounds excellent. I have always liked LaBrie more than your average person, but still only recognized him as a good-great vocalist. Here, he is an exceptional vocalist. From the heartfealt The Answer Lies Within to the enraged screaming of \"TRAPPED INSIDE THIS OCTAVARIUM\" he puts on a stunning performance.\n\nAnyways, the album itself has no fixed sound, but overall it leans much more towards the Train of Thought sound than any other of their albums. However, it isn't very comparable, the same way Train of Thought isn't comparable to any of their albums before that.\n\nSong by song, each song is very different, and is a classic in its own way. Therefore, I feel I should not discuss each song individually to spoil anything, especially since this album isn't officially out for another 8 days. Just listen, and wait for all the great surprises. I will however, for fun, list the songs I consider best to worst.\n\nOctavarium\nNever Enough\nPanic Attack\nThese Walls\nSacraficed Sons\nThe Root of All Evil\nThe Answer Lies Within\nI Walk Beside You\n\nTo all Dream Theater fans: This album is easily their best work since Scenes From a Memory, and will absolutely not disappoint you. Have no hesitation about picking it up the day its released for whatever price you have to pay.\n\nTo those who aren't big Dream Theater fans: This album is very well worth listening to, even if you have never liked Dream Theater before. The biggest critiscism of Dream Theater is usually James LaBrie, and I guarruntee you if you listen to this whole album your opinion of him will change. This is an extremely likeable album for fans of every genre, and is the next prog classic that will spawn clones for generations to come.\n",
        "\nImagine a colossal stadium. Now pack it with rockers, metalheads and prog-junkies, and throw four of the world's most technically proficient instrumentalists onto a stage in front of them. Oh, and James LaBrie, too. The result is one of the best 3-cd live albums ever.\n\nHaving seven albums and other various tidbits' worth of music to show off, DT are kings on-stage. True, not all of Train of Thought's tracks were great, but starting off with As I Am and This Dying Soul was a great move to get the crowds going. Most of Beyond This Life was nothing but weird noises, but in a good way... Apparently it's an interesting bit on the dvd. Hollow Years is great-- There's a nice little guitar-etc jam in there, and it immediately breaks into War Inside My Head. This and the following track, The Test That Stumped Them All are probably the weakest tracks on the cd. LaBrie still sounds better in the studio, in my honest opinion.\n\nDisc two is by far my favourite of the three. I don't really care much for Endless Sacrifice anymore, but the Instrumedley was one of the reasons I purchased the album in the first place. They're all in there-- Dance of Eternity, Erotomania, Hell's Kitchen, YTS\u00c9 Jam, A Change Of Seasons, Metropolis pt I... And a pair of Liquid Tension Experiment tracks. Brilliant. It launches straight into Paradigm Shift at about eight-and-a-half minutes in, and Universal Mind shortly after. Both very jazzy tracks.\n\nAs I bought Live at Budokan before Falling Into Infinity, I familiarised myself with this live performance of Trial of Tears before hearing the studio version. And let me tell you, I'd think it was a studio recording had I not known better. It's not that it SOUNDS like a studio recording, it's just that it's so well-played that it might as well be. Brill once again.\n\nNew Millenium is delightful. If anything, it's better than the studio recording. And the subtle (bwah) alteration of the lyrics towards the end is also a nice tidbit. And then the Keyboard Solo... I couldn't really get into it. It's not that catchy, and a tad too experimental for my liking.\n\nOnly A Matter Of Time was fuggin' GREAT. The new keyboard bits, the guitarisms, everything is exhilirating. The only gripe I have is that JLB's voice doesn't slot in as well as Charlie's did on the original. Boo.\n\nDisc three opens with the melodic, initially-slow-paced Goodnight Kiss. It's OK, but wasn't one of my favourite songs in the first place. When the guitary bits properly kick in, it's a nice, vigorous, melodic listen until Solitary Shell starts playing. Don't get me wrong; the studio recording was great - It was prolly my favourite track on the second disc of SDOIT. But something about the singing... I don't like it. It sounds far too whiny for my liking. The extra riffs not present in the studio version are *great*, though.\n\nStream of Consciousness? oh yes. After initially griping about the fact that it wasn't included within the Instrumedley, I listened to this and stopped caring. It's absolutely fantastic live. Seriously. If you've heard (and like) the studio, you'll love it. If you haven't, you'll hate the studio after hearing it live. Seriously.\n\nDisappear... Eh. It was another of the good tracks on SDOIT, but doesn't really work well live. I think it's the distortion on the studio track that gives it that special \"vibe\" for me. Worth a listen, though.\n\nPull Me Under was... Wow. I'm not actually a huge fan of the song, but I always listen to this track just to hear the huge cry of \"woooo!\" as soon as the intro is played. And then JLB yells \"goodnight, Tokyo!\" at the end, but that's not quite it.\n\nIn The Name Of God was my favourite track on Train of Thought, but I'm not too fond of it live. Firstly, the singing isn't great, and secondly, what with everyone being tired as hell, the band struggle towards the end of the song. I'm glad that they performed it, though, because that bumps it up to a nice, round six tracks per disc.\n\nWorth buying? Certainly, but it's not something that I'd pay over \u00a320 (roughly $35 dollars US-ish, I think) for. I'd go for Once In A LIVEtime instead, if I were you.\n",
        "\nThis \"official bootleg\" release of When Dream and Day REUnite was recorded from the 2004 Los Angeles show, which coincided with the15th anniversary of Dream Theater's first album release. The band performed that entire album during the 2nd half of their set that evening and invited former band members to join them for the encores (tracks 9 and 10).\n\nTechnology has come a long way. Dream Theater have managed to release a live recording of their first album that is far better than the album itself, which had a very compressed sound typical of the late 80s. The songs are pretty much identical to the original except for having a greater presence and force. The negative side to this release is the vocals. Personally, I think James Labrie is an excellent studio vocalist, but he lacks the power and breath to hit many of the upper range notes in the songs during a live performance although this has improved much in recent years. However, compared to the original album (and vocals of Charlie Dominici), Labrie is often flat. Of course, no one can be perfect in a 3 hour live performance.\n\nThe encores include Metropolis Part I (from Images and Words album) and To Live Forever, which was never released on an album. These two tracks feature former vocalist Charlie Dominici, who also sings rather flat in the performance and former keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Derek turns in a solid performance on Metropolis.\n\nOverall, if you own Dream Theater's first album and have always wanted to hear a better mix of the songs, you will enjoy this. The vocals really aren't too far off the mark (except for Dominici in encores), and the energy in the songs are incredible. \n\nBest tracks: A Fortune in Lies, Light Fuse and Get Away, Only a Matter of Time\n",
        "\nUntil recently i owned the bootleg (not official) version of this show, which took place in Paris in October 24, 2002.\nNow I got this official bootleg and the quality of the mix is much better than the audience recording of the bootleg - The mix is so good that at times you forget this is a bootleg.\n\nAbout the music - the addition of the keyboard instead of a second guitar gives the songs a pleasant emotion. The best example is at children of the damned - just listen to the intro or the solo.\nI'm a bit disappointed that it is used only a little during the show.\nI'm also disappointed that instead of the famous duel guitar harmonies of Dave & Adrian, they didn't try a duel guitar-keyboard but instead went on one guitar only.\n\nJames LaBrie - I think he does his best. He has no problem reaching the high notes but his problem is that Bruce Dickinson he is not and where bruce's gives the songs his power and intensity james lacks.\nSometimes his voice sounds so weak & frail (listen to invaders and hallowed) putting ththat I feel like e original album just to hear Bruce's voice.\nWhat I do like about james though is that when he holds his voice for a few seconds on the same note he starts vibrating his voice.\n\nThe other musicians, are great but this is no surprise to me since each musician in Dream Theater, excluding the singer is a true virtuoso at his instrument, again I'm only disappointed that I didn't hear the keyboard more often. Most of the songs are played almost identical to the originals except for gangland in which they played a nice slow-groovy version.\n\nThe crowd was also good. Just imagine what a treat it was for them to be in a Dream Theater concert when suddenly the whole setting changes to Iron Maiden and Dream Theater are actually starting to play Iron Maiden who must have had quite a few fans there.\n\nI say that if you play a tribute and you play it identical to the original, then at least play it well and Dream Theater does that. The reason they decided to play a tribute concert at the first place was for their own fun and I believe you shouldn't criticize something which is done for the fun (and the fans) since this is the very essence of the music we all love.\n\nSo the sound is good, the performance is good and if you love both Iron Maiden and Dream Theater I can certainly recommend this album to you.\n",
        "\nWhoa. Colour me skullfucked by the sheer verve, grit, and above all monstrous heaviness of this record. Yeah, heaviness. Dream Theater has never been afraid to drag the waters of heaviness, but when do they get credit for it? From the neoclassical shred of When Dream and Day Unite to the emotional holocaust of Awake and even up unto the holy havoc of \"The Glass Prison\" and Train of Thought, DT have been remarkably loudly and proudly metal over the years, but as with Rush in the 70s and Fates Warning in the 80s they don't get enough credit for it.\n\nI know that, I've been bitching about it for years. But this thing still took me by surprise. Because it is live and loud and HEAVY. Over a scant six tracks Dream Theater transforms a handful of their classic tracks into monsterliths, in the proud tradition of no less than Unleashed in the East. Live at the Marquee isn't the easiest record to find around these parts, and I held off on actually going out and getting it for many moons because its just a six track record and Dream Theater has no lack of quality live material (one two-disc, two three-discs, and a wealth of bootlegs). But then I downloaded \"Another Hand - The Killing Hand\".\n\n\"The Killing Hand\" has always been a fine track and I really dug the Fates Warning-ness of it all, but I never imagined how it could be so much improved by five years of touring and a singer at the height of his abilities. I was interested in hearing the \"Another Hand\" jam that opened the song more than the song itself, but as good as it is \"Another Hand\" is merely an appetizer. \"Another Hand\" is a cool little melodic interlude that sounds almost exactly like the intro to \"Through Her Eyes\" with some tasteful soloing from Kevin Moore. It is in fact a wonderful little instrumental that would've been a great addition to Images & Words but then it builds up into that iconic intro to \"The Killing Hand\".... and we're on another plain of metal excellence.\n\nBy being free of the limiting factors of Charlie Dominici and poor production, the regal heaviness of this stuff breathes free, rocking hard and riffing tightly like the bravura power-prog that it is. This is rooted in the pre-power metal genius of bands like Fates Warning and Savatage, and as a result there is a heady grandeur in the blazing violin-like guitars that rip through the up-tempo section en route to a killer solo, old school John Petrucci to the hilt. And then the melodic sections, rather than taking away from the power of the thing or even adding metal-diluting emotion simply build up more to the shrieking, pounding, ear-drum bursting climax.\n\nOh and James LaBrie? He's fucking badass on this thing. No bullshit. I've heard Images & Words, I know how fresh and lively and pure his performance is on that record is. You almost expect rainbows to burst from his vocal chords at times. Here he basically stands there screaming his balls off. It is difficult to call any performance more metal than this without resorting to truly abstract trains of thought to disqualify it. And even if you try that, it won't work. But James will just scream \"Remembered is the sacrifice/but the praisal of blood is still flowing!\" or \"I am the KILLING HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNDDDDDD!!! UAAAWAAAGGGHHH!!!!\" and you're forced to be silent and admit that Dream Theater know how to put down their calculators and rock royally.\n\nAnd that's just one track. Every other track is knocked right out of the park. From the first guitar riff of \"Metropolis\" every even vaguely heavy chord is turned into a leaden 16-ton weight, every aching dewy-eyed high note screeched like LaBrie is coming after Bruce Dickinson with a garrotting wire. Petrucci emphatically proves his love of metal guitar by crunching massively but with an eye for the song (which he often loses track of these days) while Portnoy and Myung enthusiastically bash along. In fact, the only one who retains his usual sound is Kevin Moore, but this works perfectly even amongst the heavier portions and in general he provides an interesting counterpoint to the guitar-fuelled chaos elsewhere, particularly on tracks like \"Metropolis\". And yet, even he gets his metal fix on \"Pull Me Under\", where his propulsive lead work is headbangable and thickly grooved.\n\nAnd for those of you afraid to be smothered by such devastating metal might, a beautiful rendition of \"Surrounded\" proves that Dream Theater hasn't forgotten how to play emotionally effecting but propulsive prog (Moore is a dominating force on this track), and LaBrie outdoes himself on one of his most technically demanding vocal workouts. But then you'll probably be using this track (as well as the stunning \"Bombay Vindaloo\" jam) to recover from the carpe jugulum overkill of \"A Fortune in Lies\" another WDADU stalwart that gets juiced up with the power of an entire hydroelectric plant. Like mad chemists, Dream Theater cooked up a volatile mix of tight-as-thrash riffing and claustrophobic alien grooves that showcased jaw-dropping finesse and blazing metal insight and out came the studio edition of \"A Fortune in Lies\". Now, if you take this perfect mixture and toss in an unhinged James LaBrie and a manic hyperspeed reshred of one Petrucci's most insane solos you get pure godliness.\n\nThis is Dream Theater in those magical days prior to the release of their undeniable masterwork Awake, and the subsequent loss of Kevin Moore and their original magic. This is Dream Theater in love with prog and metal and playing it damned well. Live at the Marquee is only six tracks long, but even at this length it is perhaps their greatest live performance on record and it is all definitely worth owning. Seek it out, even if you didn't like Images & Words much. You may be surprised.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Another Hand - The Killing Hand\", \"A Fortune in Lies\", \"Bombay Vindaloo\"\n",
        "\nIf I were a metal fan back in 1992 and I heard this album, brand new, for the first time I believe that the only thought that could come through my head would be \u201cWow\u2026 the true masters of the craft have arrived.\u201d\n\nFor Dream Theater (DT) truly are the masters of their craft, that craft being the realm of heavy metal. DT are, to me, undoubtedly the most talented coalition of metal musicians on Earth. The technicality of their brand of progressive metal, combined with the complexity of their songs and James LaBrie\u2019s uncanny voice make for a contribution to heavy metal that America can truly be proud of.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve made a few keyboardist changes over the year, the remaining four members of the band have consistenly performed excellent, enthralling audiences with their truly masterful approach towards metal, all beginning with this album, Images and Words.\n\nAlthough Images is DT\u2019s second album, it was the first time when you could really feel the emotion and true capabilities of this band. The songs are much longer and more complex from their previous offering, churning out many of the DT classics we all know and love today. The replacement of Charles Dominici, the singer from their first album When Dream And Day Unite, proved to be one of the best decisions DT has ever made. James LaBrie made his debut on this album, and the emotion and skill he puts into the songs on this album is a key factor what truly catapulted this album and DT in general to greatness.\n\nOf course, the amazing capabilities of guitarist John Petrucci, drummer Mike Portnoy, bassist John Myung and keyboardist (at the time) Kevin Moore are nothing to scoff at. Musically, these guys are unparalleled by metal or by artists in any other musical genres. Dream Theater albums, as far as skill and complexity are concerned, are often head and shoulders above the rest. That\u2019s why pretty much any album to come from these guys will become an instant metal classic, but Images and Words is the album that stood before them all, and still stands pretty damn tall when compared to the rest of their works today.\n\nThe opening track, \u201cPull Me Under\u201d, is to me the quintessential Dream Theater song, it was also the song that first introduced me to the band. What comes from this track is an 8-minute combination of heavy riffing, cool melodies, soothing sounds, complex keyboarding and guitar work and just plain amazing songwriting. My words cannot do justice to this or many other DT songs, but I\u2019ll try my best. This song would most likely be DT\u2019s version of \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d or \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d, the song that everyone does or should know and love. It\u2019s got a catchy, memorable refrain within a nice slow to mid-tempo composition that never gets too overly heavy, but doesn\u2019t let up at any point. It\u2019s the prime example of how to make a song that can appeal to all metal fans, from the most hardcore death metal fan to the Slipknot-hugging metal teeny-bopper, this is a song that any metalhead can listen to and at the end say \u201cThat was pretty damn good\u201d. I dream of the day I get to see DT perform this one live.\n\nThen, the mood completely changes going into \u201cAnother Day\u201d. From progressive metal to what could be considered almost adult-contemporary. It was a bold move from DT to put this as the second track, but it\u2019s a good example of the range of music that this band can perform. I didn\u2019t care for it at first, but found myself singing along after a few listens through. Saxaphone solos and calm, moody keyboards along with a smooth quiet sound are not often metal band trademarks, but DT manages to come off this track sounding cool. It just shows that your band is pretty damn talented if they can come out of some kind of \u201cprog-metal meets Kenny G\u201d track with their heads held high.\n\nAnother long, complex, indescribably beautiful track arises from \u201cTake The Time\u201d. It begins with a forceful beat, guitar and ominous keyboards, but then turns into a high-flying keyboard solo and into a slow, jazzy kinda tune\u2026 and that\u2019s just the first 60 seconds, and there\u2019s 7 and a half more to go. It\u2019s songs like this that make DT hard to review, there\u2019s so many components and influences in the music it\u2019s hard to say \u201cThis song sounds like this\u201d. This song is jazzy, bluesy, poppy, epic and metal all at the same time, catchy yet complicated, that\u2019s the essence of this song. Trust me, just take the time to listen to \u201cTake the Time\u201d a few times in order to truly grasp all that\u2019s in this DT masterpiece, it\u2019s quite possibly one of DT\u2019s all-time greatest technical achievements.\n\n\u201cSurrounded\u201d is the next track, and while not quite as long as some of the other tracks on the album, it\u2019s not less beautiful or complex. It starts with just LaBrie\u2019s enchanting voice and some nice piano medley work before erupting into another smooth and jazzy kind of track. It proves you don\u2019t need to be the heaviest or angriest band on Earth to produce some quality rock music. It\u2019s a kind of poppy, happy ballad but still retains a DT edge. It doesn\u2019t sound like metal, but it still sounds good enough to satisfy someone who may be a metal fan. \u201cSurrounded\u201d in all the DT goodness.\n\nNext, a true Dream Theater classic and all-time metal achievement hits your ears. If you don\u2019t consider this next song a classic, tear up your \u201cMusic Fan Card\u201d right now, because you quite simply don\u2019t belong in a group of people known as music enthusiasts. That song is of course, \u201cMetropolis Pt. 1 \u2013 The Miracle and the Sleeper\u201d. It\u2019s a ride through an obviously classical-infulenced piece of metal excellence. From it\u2019s heavy riff-work to complex drumming, emotional lyrics and abundance of time and mood changes, it is a track that Dream Theater can look back to twelve years ago and be proud of. It\u2019s got some of the highest of the metal highs and calmest metal can get and still hold the attention of its listeners through the entire track. The instrumental parts of the song are fantastic, the soloing is unparalleled and once again, my words cannot do this song justice. Just give it a listen, it won\u2019t be 9 wasted minutes, trust me.\n\nThe album doesn\u2019t lose any steam going into \u201cUnder A Glass Moon\u201d, which, while not as complex as some of the other songs on this album, probably is my favorite song on this album, if not one of my favorite DT songs of all time. What begins as a beautiful melding of guitar and keyboards soon turns an awesome combination of heaviness and soothing sounds. It\u2019s also one of the tracks where you can really hear the passion and emotion in James LaBrie\u2019s voice, and it\u2019s something that really gets to me. It\u2019s definitely beauty pulled from aggression, which is something I love to hear in music. Not to mention it has John Petrucci doing what is probably one of my favorite guitar solos in ANY song ever. It\u2019s a song that holds the same power and emotion for 7 minutes, never letting up once and in all honesty, I think it could\u2019ve been longer. There\u2019s too many great elements in this song to squeeze in 7 short minutes!\n\n\u201cWait for Sleep\u201d is kind of the break to catch your breath after the previous two tracks. It\u2019s no more than some haunting keyboard work, which gives you some beautiful imagery, like a cold, winter night. LaBrie\u2019s soothing voice complements the piano perfectly, just a short, calm track you can sit and relax to and regain your composure before this album\u2019s finale.\n\nIt took me awhile to shine up to \u201cLearning to Live\u201d. It\u2019s a long, winding track which isn\u2019t a problem for most DT songs, but this one it just took some time for me to get accustomed to it. It sounds very different than anything else on the album, which isn\u2019t unusual because nothing else on the album sounds quite like eachother, but this song sounded particularly \u201cout there\u201d. It\u2019s got almost a kind of spacey quality to it, something not very easy to immediately hear and appreciate. While most of DT\u2019s long epics are heavily charged and a combination of heavier sounds, this song for the most part is much more subtle, much more ballad sounding than their other epic tracks. I think that\u2019s why it took me awhile to get used to this song, but now I have a deep appreciation for the skill it took to make this track and the guts it takes to record something like this and put it on an album. In the end, it may take a few times to \u201cget\u201d this track, but once you get used to it, you\u2019ll find yourself skipping ahead to it. It\u2019s not the heaviest or most memorable song they\u2019ve ever done, but it\u2019s another one DT can be proud of.\n\nImages and Words to me is the quintessential Dream Theater album. It\u2019s got songs of all lengths and styles, from the short piano-only \u201cWait for Sleep\u201d to the epic, energetic masterpiece of \u201cMetropolis\u201d, this album is a prime example as to why DT is a success and loved by so many the world over. This is an album that should be in any metal fan\u2019s collection, whether they love death metal or rap-metal, this is one of those albums that can reach and move any listener. It is truly a classic in every sense of the word, every song on it being special and awesome in its own way. Please, if you haven\u2019t heard any Dream Theater, do yourself a favor and go track down this masterpiece. Dream Theater shows us what aggression, complexity, beauty and some damn fine talented musicians can accomplish.\n",
        "\nIt seems to me that Dream Theater is one of those bands that you either love or you hate. Yet, personally, I don't do either. While I don't think they're the greatest band of all time, I don't their they're terrible wankers, either. I guess there must be something wrong with me...\n\nAnyways, Images And Words, albeit the quintessential Dream Theater album, was not my first purchase out of their discography. That would be 1999's Scenes From A Memory, which I bought with a gift card at Future Shop, a store with limited metal selection. Well, once again, I used a gift card to buy Images And Words, this time at HMV. I guess that DT are my \"band to buy with gift cards at shitty record stores\", or something...\n\nTo be honest, the band that played on Scenes From A Memory seems a lot different than the one featured on Images And Words, seven years earlier. Of course, they did lose keyboard player Kevin Moore, who wrote the lyrics to three of the songs on Images And Words, including the smash hit Pull Me Under. Actually, I think their songwriting has improved since then, as Scenes From A Memory told a story that was easy to follow. I even read the lyrics to Images And Words, and still couldn't figure out what the album was supposed to be about, if it was a concept album at all.\n\nOf course, when it comes to musical ability, Dream Theater are undoubtably one of the more talented bands out there, and they know it. There are definitely a lot of great musical moments on this record, but as far as great songs, go, well...\n\nThere's no doubt that the opening track, Pull Me Under, is great. I think that part of the reason it stands out from the rest is the heavy guitar riff. To me, it almost sounds like 80's Metallica with keyboards and high-pitched vocals. At least, that was my first impression, anyways.\n\nOf course, leading off your album with your best track isn't always a good thing, especially when you follow it up with your weakest. I dunno what made Dream Theater think that the use of saxophone on Another Day was a good idea, but it isn't. The only rock song I've ever heard that made good use of sax was Meat Loaf's All Revved Up With No Place To Go, and that wasn't metal by any stretch. While power/prog metal often makes effective use of unusual instruments, (the xylophones on Blind Guardian's Nightfall on Middle Earth, for instance) the saxophone is an instrument that should never be heard on any metal song. Especially the watered-down, 80's adult contemporary style sax. That's just wrong...\n\nSo, after going from enjoyment to annoyance in the first two tracks, I wasn't sure what to expect from the rest of the album. As it turns out, there wasn't anything else that was memorable about Images And Words, aside from that fact that fourth track Metropolis - Part 1 contains a solo from every single instrument. I don't think I've heard that on any song that wasn't jazz, which was kinda cool.\n\nFinal track Learning To Live was also a master display of musicianship, but putting a song that's eleven and a half minutes long at the end of a record isn't usually a good thing, especially when the listener is waiting for said 8 track, 57 minute opus to end. Perhaps a true fan would find it masterful, but not me.\n\nSo, in conclusion, Images And Words will probably end up beside some Yngwie records in the category of \"Stuff That I Can't Listen To More Than Once A Month\". I don't mind great playing, but when it comes at the expense of song structure, I don't wanna hear it too often, no matter how good it is.\n\nAnd, I must say that I prefer Scenes From A Memory to this record, which hardcore Dream Theater fans might find a bit unusual... I guess I'll just rip Pull Me Under to my computer, and pull out the album whenever I forget what the other tracks sound like. Maybe I'll pick up on something that I missed the first time around...\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard Dream Theater many years ago, I was amazed to say the least. I've owned a number of their releases and they are a regular listen in my MP3 player. When I heard that they were releasing a new album I was fairly excited, and when they mentioned in a few interviews that they were going for a more \"dark\" sound my interest was definitely mustered. To me, DT had always captured a very mellow, soundscape kind of atmosphere - the kind of music I would listen to to relax and marvel at true musicianship. \n\nWhen I went to the store to purchase the album (#1 mistake of all CD purchases - hear before you buy!) I was a little confused as to why it had been reduced in price so much (about 30%) considering the store wasn't having a sale. After listening to it, I could see why. \n\nObviously the guys had been listening to large doses of nu-metal and Tool. I never really marveled at their lyrics, but these are just so banal;\n\n\"Takin\u2019 in the view from the outside \nFeeling like the underdog \nWatching through the window I\u2019m on the outside \nLiving like the underdog \nI\u2019ve been trying to justify you \nIn the end I will just defy you \nTo those who understand, I extend my hand\"\n\n(I've been trying to justify buying this album, heh.)\n\nIf I wanted to listen to mundane, inward, teenage angst lyrics I would listen to Mudknot. (One in the same really...) I mean, looking back at other DM releases the lyrics had a bit of thought in them, be they political/social/personal... but it seems as though this album is AIMING to appeal to 15-17 year olds who are going through that \"I'm so angry at the world, by the way I'm a total individual and you can't change me ok!\" mentality.\n\nThere is some hope in \"This Dying Soul\" with a bit of the old-styled soloing/keyboards but then it reverts to the mundane over distorted guitar. However at 2.15 into this song the guitar effect is EXACTLY the same that Mudvayne use. Then there's that annoying \"radio distorted\" voice. But the \"best\" is at 3.50 or so - obviously System of a Down kidnapped them all and made them create that annoying stop start guitar thing with that \"radio\" voice again. (AKA that Chop Suey mainstream single). GOD. Can I say overproduced or what?? Just listening to this CD again to write a review is pissing me off.\n\nIf you like Tool, you will like this.\nIf you like System of a Down, you will like this.\nIf you like Mudvayne, you will like this.\nIf you like any form of Nu Metal or Mallcore, you will like this.\n\nGone is the obvious Iron Maiden influence. Gone are the flowing melodies. Gone is the originality.\n\nI've never really thought that James LaBrie is amazing. In fact it's the guitar work that makes me enjoy them so. But in this album, seriously, he goes for that \"angry rap\" that Nu-Metal unfortunately cultivated. And I hate to say this, he cannot angry rap to save himself.\n\nPetrucci's guitar work has definitely spiraled. Don't get me wrong, there are the segments with super technical shredding and so forth, but the ongoing churning of power chords really makes this album slip. Plus, in the few moments when the melody isn't as bad as the rest of the album, the structure isn't really a change from their usual stuff. (In Endless Sacrifice, the intro sounds like it should be from the \"Falling into Infinity\" album. But that song too slides downwards with the chorus sounding as though it was ripped from Disturbed, seriously.)\n\nOverall, this is probably the biggest disappointment I've had this year. Don't get me wrong, I secretly listen to a bit of Nu-Metal now and then, I enjoy its mindlessness. But Dream Theater shouldn't go for that sound, they can definitely achieve more (musically) than the Linkin Parks of this world. DT are one of those bands that I always thought would produce quality music without trying to please any particular audience. This album is the beginning of the end for Dream Theater.\n\nR.I.P to good Dream Theater.\n",
        "\nHoly shit. This DVD is close to perfection. The selection of songs is perfect- it has the best songs from ToT (seeing as how that's what album the tour was for), and excludes the not so good ones; and the other songs are very well chosen, spanning all of DT's discography. It started with As I Am and This Dying SOul, and then Beyond This Life. The Zappa tribute jam in Beyond This Life features some godly soloage from JP, and an awesome duel between MP and JR; after BYL is Hollow Years, a wonderful FII ballad. The Test That Stumped Them All is played at a shockingly faster pace than the album version (which as already pretty fast). The Instrumedley WILL make you crap your pants. 14 minutes of various sections of DT's various instrumentals, including parts of 2 LTE songs (Paradigm Shift and Universal Mind) bound seamlessly together by The Dance Of Eternity. Some of the transitions bwteen songs are so perfect that it seems like they were meant to be that way. The intro to Trial Of Tears is extended into an amazing ambient section, and the rest of the song is of course awesome, particularly JP's solo. New Millenium is there with JM playing his Chapman Stick- which of course is quite Myung-core. JR has a nice solo section to himself, which starts with some fast (and awesome) wankery, and then a well written piano composition. Next up is Only A Matter Of Time- a classic WDADU song, which sounds awesome with James on vocals. Next up is Goodnight Kiss- holy crap, the feeling of the last solo is incredible live. Solitary Shell provides a brief rest with it's lightheartedness, but that is quickly replaced by more technical perfection with Stream Of Consciousness. Following that is Disappear, and the classic Pull Me Under. For the encore is In The Name Of God, which is way more powerful than the album version, very awe-inspiring.\nThe video quality is amazing, and looks close to high definition (well, at least on my HD TV). The camera angles are very well done, and provide an atmosphere of a film.There are some very impressive angles, one of my favorite is when the camera shows a view from the side of JM, looking across to JP, while the focus of the camera switches from JM to JP and back to JM. The sound is delivered in some very good Dolby Digital.\nThe crowd in this show is amazing. Apparently, in Japanese culture, a concetr is a very formal event, such as going to an symphony or opera. Many of the audience members are wearing suits. They are a great audience- they stand sitll when they need to, move around when they should, clap at the right times, and most importantly, stay quiet except at the end of a song, or the end of an awesome solo.\nThe second DVD contains lots of extra features such as documentaries, a drum solo and a multiangle version of instrumedley- good stuff. \n\nHEIL DREAM THEATER!\n",
        "\nWell, I'm generally not a fan of live albums because many of them reek of cash-in or a deficit of creativity, you know, a stop-gap in other words. I own several, but count few as my favourites. Once in a LIVEtime is no different, the record being a live album that has high-quality recording and solid performances, but not a record that takes great songs and makes them better (Let There Be Rock: The Movie, Unleashed in the East, Tokyo Tapes) and therefore perhaps not a must-own, not an integral addition to the catalogue.\n\nStill any album that manages to pack no less than four of the best Dream Theater songs in a row, those being (he says in a quavering voice) \"Voices\", \"Take the Time\", \"Scarred\", and \"Lines in the Sand\", all of those songs being ten minute-plus Epics with that capital \"E\". Not only that, but they follow it with a killer instrumedley featuring \"The Darkest of Winters\" and the most insane 'world-domination through technicality' attempt, the \"Ytse Jam\". The first disc of this collection is a blinding collection of truly amazing songs, from pieces of inevitable (and overrated) fan-favourite \"A Change of Seasons\" to the aforementioned classics, it's all good. It's interesting what trade-offs you get, from the slightly sloppy yet sparkly and energetic live version of \"Take the Time\" as compared to the streamlined and totally perfect studio version.\n\nAlas, the second disc is pretty weak in comparison, a frustrating Falling Into Infinity three-for kicking this off and boring you to death. I can't believe they actually performed \"Take Away My Pain\" live, let alone recorded it. Have they no shame? \"Trial of Tears\" features an extended intro which prolongs the boredom, and \"Hollow Years\" seems to just ramble on even longer than usual. \"Caught in a Web\" is solid, but man, \"Lie\" doesn't go as well as it should, and the final medley succeeds only in frustrating my interest in hearing good live versions of \"Metropolis\" and \"Learning to Live\". Luckily, \"Peruvian Skies\" and \"Pull Me Under\" knock it out of the park, the former grafting on pieces of \"Have a Cigar\" and \"Enter Sandman\" which somehow work perfectly.\n\nAlso, I hate solo spots on live albums because they lose all the effect they had on the live audience, and this album has three of them. Luckily, the piano solo and drum solo are kept short, and the guitar solo manages to be sporadically interesting.\n\nAnyway, this album is well worth a buy if you don't feel like blowing a hole in your wallet for Live Scenes From New York, but it is simple a stellar live album, no more and certainly no less.\n",
        "\nPity Falling Into Infinity. Pity Falling Into Infinity for being forced to follow Awake, both Dream Theater\u2019s best album and the best album of the 90s. Dream Theater had of course released the A Change of Seasons EP in the meantime, and Derek Sherinian had plenty of time to acclimatize himself to the high pressure, high-quality Dream Theater style, but as good as he is (and as entertaining a personality) the band lacks the genius of Kevin Moore and the absence hurts this album considerably. From a playing stand-point Sherinian fits in well, but he doesn\u2019t have the subtlety that Moore brought to the band, nor does he write lyrics which force a rather inexperienced Mike Portnoy to contribute a lot in that department, some of which don\u2019t turn out too well.\n\nFurthermore it is well documented that Dream Theater was forced into a more commercial direction by the label, and producer Kevin Shirley was made full producer and thus had the authority to play a role in the writing process and severely edit some of the compositions. Sometimes this works out well (the decision to remove \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d from the instrumental section of \u201cBurning My Soul\u201d was a good idea), but more often you feel that Dream Theater has been hamstrung by politics.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Dream Theater had a lot more material written than is on the album, most of which ended up on the DTIFC Fan Club CD entitled Cleaning Out the Closet. It\u2019s baffling that tracks as good as \u201cRaise the Knife\u201d, \u201cSpeak to Me\u201d, and \u201cCover My Eyes\u201d were left off of the final album, and the only explanation that makes sense is the ol\u2019 blame the label routine, cos really, there\u2019s a lot of stuff here that really isn\u2019t that great.\n\nThe most egregious example of this is \u201cYou Not Me\u201d, co-written by hired gun Desmond Child who penned a number of hits for bands like Bon Jovi and Aerosmith. The problem is however that Dream Theater has little in common with the Jove or Boston\u2019s finest, so the result is a total mess. Computerized drum-beats, horribly lame lyrics (\u201cwatching you run is making me laaaaazay\u2026\u201d), and a frankly awful chorus that sounds like it\u2019s been ripped from an N*Sync record and roughly stitched onto a low-end DT song. These guys are known for soaring vocals, but the chorus has that sparkly guitar sound and sadistically catchy mentality that one generally associates with boy bands.\n\nAnother song that flat-out does not work is \u201cTake Away My Pain\u201d, a limp ballad that covers the same territory as \u201cAnother Day\u201d from Images & Words but with little of the same success. Portnoy appears to be playing bongos or something, and the whole package just seems to scream \u2018adult contemporary\u2019, something we metalheads tend to avoid like the plague. It\u2019s definitely written for the 45-60 and looking for happy music demographic, toothless acoustic pap in the same vein as later Paul Simon or Sting.\n\nOn the whole the album also lacks the depth of Awake, with little of the penetrating psychological muck and more juvenile anger (\u201cBurning My Soul\u201d) and sedate balladry (\u201cTrail of Tears\u201d, \u201cHollow Years\u201d, \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d), and also an alarmingly topical slant that is really quite far removed from classic DT concerns (check the blatant name-drops on \u201cJust Let Me Breathe\u201d and \u201cTake Away my Pain\u201d). However, when this album is good, it\u2019s really good.\n\nDespite its generic lyrics and harmlessly aggressive LaBrie snarling, \u201cBurning My Soul\u201d packs some serious crunch, and \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d is a satisfying piece of mellow prog if you\u2019re in the mood for it. The best part is that this song segues into \u201cLines in the Sand\u201d, a bristling, loopy progmonster that packs a funky bounce and some of Petrucci\u2019s best stuff both in the lyric and the guitar department. It\u2019s got power and groove, infectiously catchy melodies (uncommon in epics), even featuring a great guest spot from King\u2019s X howler Doug Pinnick and a mesmerizing solo that takes the time to move the listener and advance the song unlike some of the sometimes pointless shredding of Train of Thought and other more recent releases. \u201cLines in the Sand\u201d is both profound and grand, easily amongst the best compositions in the DT canon. \n\n\u201cPeruvian Skies\u201d is both their best ballad and their most convincingly metallic pounder all in one song, Floydian psychedelia and Metallica riffery. Although Dream Theater is somewhat infamous for \u2018adolescent girls in trauma\u2019 songs (see: Scenes from a Memory, \u201cAnna Lee\u201d, \u201cGoodnight Kiss\u201d, etc.), \u201cPeruvian Skies\u201d makes you rather ambivalent about the lyrical content because it rules so damn hard.\n\nPortnoy\u2019s other two lyrical contributions are solid as well, although again not specifically due to the lyrics themselves. \u201cNew Millennium\u201d manages to invoke a futuristic vibe through Myung\u2019s use of the Chapman Stick, the strangely alien tones enhancing the eventual metal crunch that builds in intensity throughout the song. The lyrics are slightly repetitive, but much like the guitar the repetition and submerged backing vocals tend to add to the effect. As for \u201cJust Let Me Breathe\u201d, while it does give a slight impression of an aging prog band screaming \u2018we\u2019re kinda fun, sometimes!\u2019 into the night, it\u2019s also a bouncy fun song, a real kick live and an occasionally poignant commentary on the sorry state of the music biz.\n\nFalling Into Infinity is an enigmatic album, an album of peaks and valleys. On \u201cPeruvian Skies\u201d and \u201cLines in the Sand\u201d the band is at its best, and even the overwrought \u201cTrial of Tears\u201d favourably invokes classics like \u201cLearning to Live\u201d with its mercury drop bass lines and poetic lyrics. Dream Theater certainly retains the gift of creating inspired progressive metal, but sadly from here on with less depth and power than on the Awake record, and from here on out much more sporadically than one would like...\n\nStand-Outs: \"Lines in the Sand\", \"Peruvian Skies\", \"New Millennium\"\n",
        "\nDream Theater is one of the leading bands in the progressive metal scene, and up to this point, had released two very solid concept albums in the form of Scenes From A Memory and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Their newest album, Train Of Thought, rose my expectations even further. Unfortunately though, the wankery that a lot of people blame this band for indulging in has appeared to finally catch up with them.\n\nSome people call this album a step into nu-metal for the band. The only \"nu-metal\" I can even remotely find on this album are some Disturbed-style harmonics in the chorus of Endless Sacrifice. They sound a little like the harmonics in \"Down With The Sickness\".\n\nBut the number one knock on this album is the length of the songs. Quite a few of them could be very well done being cut in half. Unlike their last album, the long instrumental breaks get very tedious, and actually rather annoying, and are not really in any way interesting. There's just too much of a reliance on keyboard work. I haven't been bothered by their wankery in a while, but this album is the exception to the rule. It's gotten out of hand. The aforementioned Endless Sacrifice and In The Name Of God have some very long keyboard sections and guitar solos that don't fit the songs very well in my opinion. The 4-minute instrumental break in Honor Thy Father is actually a strong point in the album, though. There is a very good guitar solo there and the riffing is strong.\n\nI also don't like the idea that this is not a concept album, like their last two albums. The songs, being as long as they are as well as the lack of a story is why the wankery just gets in the way, and their's not a lot of flow to the album, making most of the songs boring. The concept is what really made 6 Degrees interesting, and made listening to the 42-plus-minute title track of that album very bearable and enjoyable. I couldn't find that here, though.\n\nThere are good points as well on this album. Petrucci's riffing in particular seems to be stronger than before. I still think they need a rhythm guitarist though. But he seems to handle riffing quite well. James LaBrie is still crystal-clear voiced, and his vocal performance on \"Vacant\" is quite good. The drumming, especially on \"As I Am\" shows that Portnoy is still on top of his game, and Jordan Rudess is still one of the best keyboardists in metal. \"As I Am\", \"Honor Thy Father\" and \"Vacant\" are all strong songs. Production is clear as usual, courtesy of Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci, who have been producing DT's albums since Scenes From A Memory. John Petrucci also gets a little more freedom to cut loose with his guitar work, which is also a good thing.\n\nSo overall, this release is average for the most part. The album is not bad per se, but I know this band is capable of more if they just focused on writing good songs, and cut it out with the useless meanderings that have finally caught up with them.\n",
        "\nBeing the first Dream Theater album I was ever introduced to, 6DoIT has always been one of the first things that comes to mind when I think Dream Theater. I still enjoy this album very much but, ever since I discovered their older material, this has been pushed out of the spotlight, and I don't think it will ever find it's way back. Unfortunately, when I compare 6DoIT to Dream Theater's ultimate masterpiece, Images and Words, it just can't reach that same level of divine greatness.\nThe biggest reason I can see for this, is that 6Degrees is an album of extremes. More than any other work DT has ever done, this album (almost always) clearly sets the line between the soft songs and the heavy ones, and that, in my opinion, provides for a slightly less enthralling listening experience. Nonetheless, there is still more than enough killer progressive rock/metal on these two discs to satisfy almost any Dream Theater fan.\n\nTake your time and look around.\nIs this utopia you've found?\n\n\nDISC ONE\n-----\n\n1. The Glass Prison\nAs is always the case, Dream Theater open with a bang. While I've never been a great fan of the really heavy DT songs, this one kept me entertained all the way through. Rudess' guitar samples sound great, and the whole band is in top form. Unfortunately, this song has started to thrill me less and less each time I hear it, although I'm not quite sure why that is. Quite good anyways.\n8/10\n\n2. Blind Faith\nFor me, the pride and joy of disc one would have to be Blind Faith. As one of the few songs on the entire album to actually create a really good mix of heavy and lighter musical elements, I loved this one right from the start. Clever lyrics from James Labrie complement the engrossing musical package, which starts out slow, and builds up speed, until it climaxes in the middle with an awesome guitar riff leading into a beautiful piano solo. This is probably my favorite part of the whole album. Incredible song.\n10/10.\n\n3. Misunderstood\nBeing the first DT song I ever heard, misunderstood holds a special place in my heart. It basically begins with just some light guitar and bass, before adding in some atmospheric keyboards and drumming. The whole song just grows from beginning to end, getting louder and more powerful every little while until it reaches it's peak with a final chorus. While some may find the closing minute a bit boring or distracting, I think it's a very creative use of volume and sound (I'm a Mike Patton fan by the way, so that may explain why I enjoy this passage so much).\n7/10.\n\n4. The Great Debate\nAs the other real heavy track on DISC ONE, my opinion of Great Debate is very similar to that of Glass Prison. It doesn't encorporate the progressive side of DT enough to become one of my favorites, but it's hardly a throwaway track. It's well written, well played, and has very thought provoking lyrics. Not very much else to say here.\n7/10.\n\n5. Disappear\nIt took me a while to get into this one, but now that I have, it's become a great listen for me. While the overall theme and tone of the song is dark and sad (it's a song by Labrie about the death of a woman in his life), the ending manages to be quite uplifting, and rounds out the track nicely. \n8/10.\n\n\nDISK TWO\n-----\n\n(note: the entire second disk is comprised of only one song, the title track. It's an epic song, clocking in at 42:04 minutes in length, and spans a wide variety of music. As the title suggests, each section lyrically deals with a different type of mental distress or illness. The song is divided into the following eight parts for the sake of navigation and refrence, and to represent the different degrees of inner turbulence)\n\nI - Overture\nII - About To Crash\nIII - War Inside My Head\nIV - The Test That Stumped Them All\nV - Goodnight Kiss\nVI - Solitary Shell\nVII - About To Crash (reprise)\nVIII - Losing Time/Grand Finale\n\nAs the center of attention on this album, 6Degrees is a stunning amalgam of many different musical genres and techniques. It starts with the mid-tempo Overture, gains ground and emotion with ATC and explores some heavier ground with WIMH and TTTSTA. Then it cools down with the beautiful GK ballad and returns to the mid-tempo sound with Solitary Shell. ATC (reprise) represents the final hard hitting song on the album, before the epic grand finale in Losing Time. All the songs are technically profound both musically and lyrically. Some are great for driving and rocking out to, while others are more tranquil and relaxing. Overall, it's an experience not to be missed!\n10/10\n\nSo there it is. 6DoIT by Dream Theater. DT fans should find all they need in a good prog album, while others will most likely find certain musical aspects of the album more enjoyable than others. Regardless, all music fans owe it to themselves to give it a shot.\n",
        "\nWell, allow me to start by stating that I have seen Dream Theater before, and this truly captures their live performance: Boring and a test of one's patience. Sure, they can play every song note for note, but when there's no stage energy whatsoever it kind of loses it's entire point. I mean, I could listen to an album and look at a picture of them and save my $60... but enough about my experiences, on with the actual review.\n\nThe first disc, I can pretty much entirely skip over, since it's just 3/4 of Scenes From A Memory done almost exactly as the CD was, with some annoying solos and some seriously offkey vocal moments. The original wasn't too bad, but these flaws seriously detracted from the music and I found myself eagerly waiting for it to end. The album ended rather abruptly and I thought to myself \"Huh? Where's the rest of the disc?\" I threw in the next disc, and found the rest of Scenes From A Memory... would it have been too much to ask to put the whole thing on one CD? They've already inconvenienced me enough by making me listen to the whole album, but do they really have to make it span two discs? I guess they do! A minor gripe, yes, but a gripe nonetheless.\n\nAfter Scenes From A Memory finally ended, it was on to the less predictable half of the set list. The second disc, as could be expected, was plagued with the same problems as the first with a few extra problems. A number of transitions between songs were abrupt and very poorly done, like certain members didn't realize they were done with the song they were doing. Some of the added solos were inanely long, the nearly 7 minute keyboard solo getting special note for using an obviously pre-recorded synth drum beat, like the kind that comes pre-packed on inexpensive Yamahas. Yeah, good job guys.\n\nBy the third disc, I realized that this wasn't going to change in any way. It seemed like they threw this setlist together as sort of a sick joke, fully intent on picking only their longest most mind-numbing songs available so they could maximize their showing off time. I was kind of surprised when, by the end of this masochistic effort, I hadn't heard one moment of simplistic catchiness. No Pull Me Under, no Hollow Years, just hours upon hours of boring senseless wanking.\n\nBy the end of this I was overjoyed that it was finally over, bored to the point of exhaustion and mildly agitated as well. Even without having to sit through Scenes From A Memory, this would've been a difficult listen, but with it included it's much much worse. A live album should be at least somewhat different from the studio release, but this is quite possibly the most sterile live album I've ever heard. Just listen to the studio albums if you must, or one of the hundreds of better bands, and don't bother wasting your time on this crap. If, for some illogical reason, you feel a bizarre compulsion to waste $25 on this so you can hear \"awesome solos\" like 8 seconds worth of the Simpsons theme, I genuinely pity you.\n",
        "\nNever being one to disappoint, DREAM THEATER are back again with yet another colossal disc filled to the brim with epic mind rousing arrangements that are as memorable as they are lengthy (seven tracks at nearly seventy minutes). Before we proceed, though, let\u2019s consider this\u2026 Musically, the word progressive in its true sense signifies both evolution and growth in ability as well as diverse, artistic expression by way of experience. As the leaders of the prog-metal scene, DREAM THEATER are out-and-out notorious for change and, with their latest metamorphosis, confirm that perpetual transformation is inevitable.\n\nWith an emphasis on heaviness, \"Train Of Thought\" continues along the similar lines of 2002\u2019s opus, \"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence\". Seemingly drawing influence from the likes of MEGADETH, METALLICA, PANTERA, and TOOL, \"Train Of Thought\" is a grab bag of familiarity that DREAM THEATER has somehow renovated to sound fresh and their own. By no means does this imply that there is a lack of complexity or unworldly musicianship, it simply insinuates that this album is by far DREAM THEATER's edgiest record to date. \n\nWhile thumbing through the pages of the booklet, you will observe that there are no photographs of the members and that everything is printed in black and white, making it evident that the band has certainly succeeded in what appears they were striving to achieve: A stripped, raw metal classic, where the music speaks for itself. \n\nIn addition, each lyric sheet is accompanied by enigmatic imagery that embodies what may be occurring in that specific song. Case in point, the Petrucci inscribed \"Endless Sacrifice\" features a photo of a man and a woman\u2019s interlaced hands being forced apart by another set of hands and a crowd in the backdrop. This may represent that the constant responsibilities of a recording/touring musician is strenuous on a relationship. Like the music, these puzzles are open to your own observation. \n\nEvery last number on \"Train Of Thought\" is a winner and each element of performance is in top form... From John Petrucci\u2019s thick rhythms and blazing solos or Mike Portnoy\u2019s godly drum work to James Labrie\u2019s flawless vocals, which are the highlight of his career, in my opinion. The most honorable mentions are the first single \"As I Am\", \"This Dying Soul\", which appears to be a sequel a previously released DT composition, the breathtaking instrumental \"Stream Of Consciousness\", and mentioned earlier, \"Endless Sacrifice\". \n\nHere's your ticket, now buckle in and take a ride (or several) on the DREAM THEATER \"Train Of Thought\" before it runs over you. Either way, it's bound to be one amazing trip.\n\n\n- Harley Carlson\n",
        "\nAwake is the critical record from, what was at the time, an amazing band. In a career full of blindingly bright moments, Awake is the shining crown jewel that rises above them all. Images & Words is more influential, Train of Thought is heavier, Scenes From a Memory is the current cosmopolitan pick for their best, but none of that matters. Simply put, Awake is where Dream Theater moved away from the sometimes sophomoric excess of their first two records into a realm of maturity and glorious yet restrained performances, a realm that is heartbreakingly perfect, a realm that they seldom fully enter anymore, preferring an amalgam of the lyrical darkness of Awake with the absurdly amazing playing on Images & Words. Thus, much as I enjoy parts of the catalogue, they are virtually incapable of ascending to the absolute pinnacle of excellence that they achieved a decade ago, this year.\n\nI tremble as I try to express how much this record has meant to me, how these songs are burned into my mind. This is prog-metal gone dark, stripped of it's silly window dressing and it's trademark excess. Awake is song writing over performance, real emotion and ideas over flights of fantasy and overblown \"messages\". Every performance is sharp, every note planned out and pressed into the service of the song. If you consider the maniac soloing of \"Metropolis Part 1\" or \"This Dying Soul\" distracting or overwhelming, take the time to immerse yourself in a work of grand, groundbreaking vision.\n\nThe album works on a variety of levels, from the high ground intellectualism of the lyrically challenging \"Scarred\" and \"Voices\" to the down and dirty rock'n'roll power at the heart of \"6:00\" and \"Lie\". In addition, the use of the famous recurring riff phenomena gives this album a cohesiveness and unity like no other album I can think of, save for overt concept albums like Scenes From a Memory and Tommy. It's subtle, requiring many listens to discern, but soon you might find yourself theorizing about the significance of say, the keyboard melody from \"Space Dye-Vest\" appearing in \"The Mirror\". Is this symbolic of \"The Mirror\"'s alcoholic protagonist sliding into the delusional despairing isolation of \"Space-Dye Vest\", is it simply Kevin Moore sneakily adding another touch of complexity to a frightfully intelligent composition, or is it just your imagination, did you really hear what you thought you did? The recurring riff phenomena gives Awake an amazingly dream-like quality, as if these songs are just being fished out of some sort of collective unconscious, pure emotion manifested as spell-binding music.\n\nThis album marks a paradigm shift for the neo-prog movement. I am firm in the belief that without Awake many of the more cerebral modern prog acts wouldn't be around as they are today, many of them probably going in a more Symphony X -type direction. Awake addresses real concerns without being comically topical like Rush, Queensryche, and even later Dream Theater can be (see \"The Great Debate\"). Every song relates to a feeling or an internal conflict, as if we are being given a chance to sift through the subconscious of the members of the band, who were at a tremendous crossroads in real life too. \n\nThus, from Kevin Moore we get the desperate cry for freedom of \"6:00\", a catalytic opener with perhaps Mike Portnoy's most charmingly and jaw-droppingly self-indulgent performance, a perfect counterpoint to Moore's frenetic keyboard squawk. This (along with \"Erotomania\") is the link to the prog-mania of the \"Ytse Jam\" and \"Learning to Live\", a real performance piece that can truly be called energetic like almost nothing else. Despite the very real sense of a creative mind confined to mediocrity in the lyrical narrative, Kevin Moore is writing fun, hummable, almost rapped lyrics that highlight James LaBrie's new found sense of power and aggression. LaBrie chews scenery here, snapping off syllables and giving a biting edge to his high notes that seems to owe more to Sebastian Bach than any classically-inclined operatic style as employed on the previous album. Indeed, this song is the adrenaline on a measured and gloomy record, a track that incites bopping and headbanging from the opening samples, impeccably arranged until they have their own bizarre rhythm and pentameter.\n\nLike Moore, Petrucci gives us a harrowing glimpse into his own mind, fearlessly pounding us with his self-doubt, with his religious conflicts, with the primal screams that we all sometimes would like to get out. \"Caught in a Web\" provides an interesting counterpoint to Moore's wanderings and desire to escape, almost as if the album mirrors the falling out between Dream Theater and Kevin Moore. On \"6:00\", Moore tells us that he feels hemmed in. On \"Caught in a Web\", Petrucci tells us that he cannot escape, as if Dream Theater has become the spiders web and Moore it's helpless prey. Appropriately then, the song is a sledgehammer, with Portnoy and Myung driving the song forward with a single-minded trudge while Petrucci and Moore, if anything, lighten the affair with a hopelessly gloomy yet still anthemic flick of the wrist.\n\nLaBrie and Petrucci continue on in this little analogy I'm playing out in my overly analytical mind with \"Innocence Faded\", a very Images & Words style song about, obviously, the loss of innocence. Throughout this review you may notice I don't give much in the way of criticism towards the music (because I think most of it is just perfect), but I will say that \"Innocence Faded\" has a pretty poor chorus. The verses are amazing, great examples of the dark side of I&W, as the keys and guitars sparkle without being uplifting; the chorus however, is simply incongruous with the rest of the song. It's like they grafted the chorus from another song onto an unfinished one. Regardless, the ride-out harmony is amazing, and it's blessed with some truly stand-out performances.\n\nAfter a frenzied instrumental work-out called \"Erotomania\", which is incidentally one of the strongest uses of the recurring riff idea as it shares riffs with at least three other songs, Petrucci gives us a superbly poetic lament about how difficult it is to have faith sometimes. \"Voices\" features some truly amazing lyrics, both effecting and ambiguous while possessing a great flow and cadence (no Anthrax-style line cramming here) that give LaBrie a perfect platform to truly shine on. This is one of the prime examples of where Awake improves on I & W. On the Petrucci-penned \"Under a Glass Moon\" for example, the poetry is cheesy and depends to heavily on florid description. Here, Petrucci raises important questions that stick with you. \"Is there fantasy in refuge/God in politicians/Should I turn on my religion/These voices in my head tell me to...\" Musically, the performances are solid as ever, with special mention to Kevin Moore. Appropriate to the theme, Moore turns in a gothic, cathedral like tone that is unique in the DT canon (perhaps the ride out in \"Finally Free\"). Rather than lose the focus of the story Petrucci is trying to tell with showboating and key'n'strings duels, he adds texture and flavour throughout, adding to the chilly atmosphere permeating the track. \"Voices\" is an epic that remains committed to song writing, the crazed and eventful break occurring at a logical point in the song and following an amazingly well-chosen cameo by a rap artist who adds an extra degree of credibility as Petrucci gradually ramps up the intensity underneath. Other than \"Scarred\", I feel \"Voices\" is James LaBrie\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds finest hour, as he displays an incredibly amount of shade in his tonality and impeccably well-chosen phrasing. In fact, the only improvement that could possibly be made to the performance occurs on Once in a LIVEtime, where James actually manages to inject more feeling and emotion into the final charge that leads into \"The Silent Man\".\n\nSpeaking of that very song, \"The Silent Man\" is a perfect example of how versatile Dream Theater has become. It's inspiring and up-lifting acoustic song-writing, and that nifty little solo towards the end of the song would fit on a far more mainstream record than this. I love this song for it's simplicity, just James and John on the guitar without any accompaniment (there may be a hint of keys towards the end to give that escalating sensation), and the Live Scenes From New York version actually angers me because in adding electricity and making it a full band piece, the subtlety and magic is gone. However, on the album there is nothing but pure perfection, even down to the excellent backing vocals contributed by one of the producers. Lyrically, this song is also about faith and familial relationships, like the calm denouement of an older man looking back at the passion of his confused youth (\"Voices\"). However, it is only a brief respite.\n\nMike Portnoy's contribution to Awake is pure sledge, a love letter to Pantera that is earthshakingly heavy. This isn't heavy for prog, this is undeniably heavy. The guitars are a distorted, face-melting, force of nature like virtually nothing else. The pounding rhythm and crushingly heavy guitar give added support to Portnoy's anguished tale of despair and self-loathing, an autobiographical account of an alcoholic trying to drag himself out of the hole that he finds himself in. This song is mean, sullen, uncommunicative and absolutely spine-crushing. I'll never forget watching this song explode live, heavy beyond heavy on a night when the band played the entire Train of Thought album, possibly the heaviest prog album ever made. \"The Mirror\" stomped all over it. Special mention to the high (but not sweetening) keyboard work that gives what you think is a slight respite from the stomp before you realize that it is subtly warped and disturbing, more of the cathedral-style dramatics that bolden and only add to the seriousness and class of the record. And then, just as the song seems to be grinding to a halt...\"LIE\"!\n\nI remember listening to this album for the first time and practically jumping at the abrupt change of gears into this loping crunch-fest. This is Moore's second contribution to the album, and it is similar to \"6:00\" in that it employs a deceptively swinging vocal melody that sheds more light on his disenfranchisement and growing paranoia (at least, as far Awake being a narrative in my own mind). \"Lie\" just plains rocks, with a hip-shakin' and headbangin' beat that leads to a real crowd pleasing chorus. Plus, \"Lie\" features by far and away the most badass rendition of a nursery rhyme ever (sorry \"Enter Sandman\"), James having fun being bad with the effortlessly memorable lyrics. Recurring riff phenom strikes once again, as we suddenly plunge back into a complex and daring reprise of \"The Mirror\" which allows the band to flex it's considerable musical chops.\n\nAfter that two song assault on the senses, another breather is needed, which comes in the form of John Myung's spacey and elegant \"Lifting Shadows Off a Dream\". The bass in this one is terrific, very melodic and mercurial as with other Myung comps like \"Trial of Tears\" and \"Learning to Live\", Portnoy doing some nice almost Simon Phillips-like light touch stuff, Petrucci and Moore adding colour, shimmer, and vibrancy wherever their enchanted music works it's way in. This song is very much about transformation and love, perhaps offering a chance at a metamorphosis for Moore (which, leaving and forming ChromaKey, he took). Regardless, LaBrie is heartfelt and moving, and the harmonizing and gradual uplift on this song is sublime. This is the sound of true art, of a genius that few bands truly possess; something that Dream Theater seems content to toss off as if it's no big thing.\n\nThe hardworking, kitchen-sink epic of Awake is \"Scarred\". It is of comparable length and placement (second last rather than last) to the hardworking, kitchen-sink epic on Images & Words, that being of course \"Learning to Live\". The difference is that on that record there were no less than five hardworking, kitchen-sink epics (\"Pull Me Under\", \"Take the Time\", \"Metropolis\", \"Under a Glass Moon\", and \"Learning to Live\"), and just like \"Learning to Live\" represents Images & Words, with it's over the top chopperiffic craziness, so \"Scarred\" is an avatar of the Awake record as a whole, a song of considerable heft and density possessed with a steely-eyed drive and an amazing amount of intelligence.\n\nI consider \"Scarred\" to be John Petrucci's greatest song-writing accomplishment, the lyrics perfectly emoting the mental scars we all carry through our lies, a grating cry for help that goes unanswered. James LaBrie is amazing in his best performance ever and John Petrucci goes beyond the call with several unbelievable solos, the first being a bit of jazzy genre-bending cool, the second being a high-pitched noodler, and then and out and out note-dense shredder over a mid-paced beat. The song is more active and communicative than the unapproachable and majestic \"Voices\", especially on it's technically astounding break that gives us the only taste of the duelling that dominates Images and SFAM. The chorus is the only commercial part in the song (it's not quite \"You Not Me\" though), but it fits in perfectly with the rest, as if the verses are his psychotic ramblings and only on the chorus does he manage to clear his head.\n\nFinally, Moore closes the album with a sombre, introspective piano-only piece. It's an intriguing melody, and there's something hypnotic and tragic about the way Moore mingles the two main piano \"riffs\" throughout the song. It's a song about growing increasingly alienated from the world, a man who has become obsessed with the models in fashion catalogues to the exclusion of having real, meaningful relationships. On another level, it is Moore's greatest expression of creative freedom on Awake, and yet it is strangely burnt out and smothered, as if it is the aural equivalent of his deadened nerves as he grows catatonic. It is dreamy and only half-awake, best enjoyed when in a dark mood or about to head into sleep. Because it is so stark and centered on one instrument, every move counts, the way he pauses before hitting a certain key, or the way he adds in little transitory fills to move into a new vocal melody becomes a captivating experience. James is both worn and fresh in his vocal delivery, and when the whole band comes in to help drive the song to it's inevitable doom it is every bit as fine and grand an ending as any other in the DT catalogue, more so even because it is so antithetical to the huge anthemic closes of \"Learning to Live\", \"A Change of Seasons\", \"Grand Finale\", and \"Trial of Tears\".\n\nKevin Moore left Dream Theater because he was bored and frustrated with the way the band was putting performances ahead of song writing. It is odd then that he left after the record that fits that statement the least of any in their discography, the one most obviously bearing the imprint of his unique style. If he had not gone on to create even better music, I'm not sure I'd be able to get over the tragedy.\n\nDo yourself a favour. Buy Awake, and study it hard. It is both the most accessible and the most challenging record Dream Theater has released yet. It is also one the greatest prog-metal albums, prog-rock albums even, ever made.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Space-Dye Vest\", \"6:00\", \"Scarred\"\n",
        "\nI have a lot of gripes about this album. If these guys wanna wank, more power to them, but don't play crappy ballads all the time that hardly qualify as mediocre. Stellar production, cool lyrics, good musicianship (obviously), but unfortunately they couldn't cut down on the crap. \n\nThe Bad tracks include Blind Faith, which actually breaks into something worthwhile speedy bluesy section at about 5.01, but it's much too late to start shredding, the listener already gave up. Misunderstood is a worthless power ballad, that has about as much balls as a hamster. The Great Debate has a couple good riffs, but it's all been done before. As I was nodding off during the plodding Disappear, I could have sworn James said \"I have a mangina\". Obviously another pussy ballad. If that wasn't enough, there's a whole other disc chock full of more eunuchified crapola. Overture goes for way too long, if this track was like 2 minutes long total I would probably praise it, but they milk it, and milk it, and I'm getting very sleepy again. Goodnight kiss is another power ballad, I want METAL, not some crappy ballads with excellent prog metal thrown in. Losing Time Grand Finale ends off the title track with some fast prog metal that just shreds... oh wait it's more pussy rock.\n\nThere are only a couple above mediocre tracks, those being best described as the ones that stand out from the boring pussy rock but aren't quite excellent metal. About to Crash and it's reprise are really mellow prog with some heavier hints in the reprise. James sounds good, and the lyrics and overall composition work well, especially the piano parts, really different. Solitary Shell also is pretty good, not quite a ballad, but yet it is, just more of an uplifting and uptempo ballad, and the lyrics are fairly touching, detailing a man's life of introversion and depression, to which many of us can relate, so it works in the way that it means something, and the music amplifies that.\n\nThe good tracks on here aren't really just \"good\" they fucking kick ass 14 ways to Sunday! The Glass prison starts out fairly foreboding, then adds some killer guitar work, eventually repeating the forward moving melody. A little keyboard. Then as it slows into 1.45 it takes off with a killer wah-laden lick, headbanger's rejoice! Every time that licks comes back it's just ownage. Later on the melody returns with more cool keyboard stuff, then ritards into a heavy one note groove riff. Pretty much the song stays heavy throughout and goes for 14 minutes(!!) but never get's long-winded, and that's quite the feat. \n\nMovements 3&4 of the title are the best, not just amonst this album but amongst the great stuff. War Inside My Head is a great song about war, although I never really got the \"inside my head\" though possibly it's all in the narrator's mind? Badass either way you take it. \"A free vacation of palm trees and shrapnel\" yes that's definitely metal through and through. It leads right into The Test That Stumped Them All, which starts out with shredtastic riff, leading into a two note riff for just a bid, and the verse destroys. James sings with balls, and the riff underneath is thrashy as fuck, some of the psuedo triplets in there. The riff that reoccurs between the different parts of the song is kind of similar to the fast riff in metallica's one, but is much better. The solo section has a new riff, and the shredding from the intro comes out of nowhere, still good. A keyboard solo, return to shred, end.\n\nWhy, someone explain to me why they couldn't play more heavy tracks? If it was all pussy rock under the guise of progressive that's one thing, but those kickass tracks really frustrate me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this way. So in closing, download the three godly tracks and buy a Yes cd, you'll be much more pleased that way.\n",
        "\nMany metal bands are well-known and respected for their diversity among/within albums, even though some of the oddball, atypical albums that these bands release aren't well-received by the metal-buying public and the media. Dream Theater lies somewhere in the forefront of bands who strive for continued experimentation and evolution. \n\nFalling Into Infinity is Dream Theater's 1997 follow-up to the much-loved 1995 EP A Change of Seasons. To the dismay of many, the epic title track of ACoS didn't foreshadow what was to come from the band; however, it established its own unique footing in the prog/rock metal genre and in DT's discography.\n\nPersonally, I can understand why many metalheads and Dream Theater fans don't like this album and why many people consider it DT's worst offering, but it's much better than When Dream and Day Unite, Scenes From a Memory, and Train of Thought IMO.(Chronologically, these three albums suffered from weak riffing and vocals; overuse of soloing and cheesiness; and mallcore elements.) \n\nDT took a different direction with Falling Into Infinity--one that lays off the face-peeling guitar assault and shoots towards prog-rock territory to create an ethereal, accessible album that gives nods to Eric Johnson and Pink Floyd. \n\nA rotten brownie point is that FiI isn't quite as progressive as I & W, but it's not as commercial as Train of Thought, even though Train of Thought oddly has some of Dream Theater's most impressive soloing and riff-work. Where this album succeeds is its earnest portrayal of feeling and organic tones.\n\nBeginning the album in typical triumphant flair is New Millennium, an 8+ minute funky ditty that shows Labrie getting down and dirty with his vocal gymnastics and illuminates Petrucci's uncanny ability for spiraling, unrelenting guitar wizardry. Honestly, I believe that this song is one of the catchiest to ever come from the band. The crescendos and key changes are very -I-worthy.\n\nLetting us down with a foray into pop sensitivity is a fairly decent, mid-paced metal n'roll song called You Not Me that is somewhat annoying in its mainstream credibility, but has quite a snazzy breakdown and whimsical guitar solo. The breakdown is exhilarating because of how immediate and staccato it is. It basically makes up for the lackluster songwriting shown here.\n\nPeruvian Skies follows and it's interesting because a strange girl named Vanessa is mentioned in the lyrics. It's quite interesting because she is obviously a different character than Victoria, the whiny bitch on Scenes from a Memory. (If someone could explain the inspiration for these two people, please email me or post something on the forum. I would love to know. Otherwise, Vanessa and Victoria need to go run off to the woods together and have hot lesbian sex or something of that nature....anything that would alter the storylines in the aforementioned song/album so that they would become obscene, thus relieving us from such petty pretentiousness.) \n\nWell, Peruvian Skies consists of dreamy, languid choruses and verses initially, but the chorus is sung with much more fervor near the end and it's an excellent effect if I may say so myself. Guitars aren't too bad either, keeping a steady rhythm that has a very attractive climax. \n\nKeeping with the pattern of heartfelt, driving songs is the first of three excellent ballads to be found here, Hollow Years. Beginning with a flamenco-flavored acoustic guitar piece, it quickly becomes this extremely moving, catchy number that seems to inspire as efficiently as many Christian bands, yet without the lyrical simplicity.\n\nHeralding ambivalence from metalheads is a fairly angry down-and-dirty rocker which sounds like one of the slower numbers off of Metallica's Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. Soloing isn't noteworthy here again, but that doesn't mean anything because how often do we get to see DT angry? Hmm? Not very often.The bass and drums chug and boom--chiggachiggaboomboom--and help to paint an overall portrait of Dream Theater at their most misanthropic and nihilistic. The only problem with this song is that, at times, the verses sound a bit meandering and incoherent. No biggie, though. It's really quite inconsequential of a problem.\n\nHell's Kitchen is the lone instrumental that ensues and it is perhaps Dream Theater's most emotional, bare-bones instrumental to date. It's very similar to the instrumental For Absent Friends on Opeth's Deliverance in the way that it takes a set amount of riffing and melody and repeats it for emphasis, while still maintaining a sense of progression.\n\nLines in the Sand is once again a long, funky number that features guest vocals from Doug Pinnick of King's X. Lasting over 12 minutes, this is a masterpiece, featuring 'planetarium' intro guitars(I know that description sounds way off base, but I'm using the psychological technique of attaching sounds and/or images to physical, tangible objects), great(yet simple) soloing, and excellent soulful vocal performances by Labrie and Pinnick. \n\nTake Away My Pain is the second of the three ballads on this album, and I'm sure that person X who is listening to this album and hates it is saying to himself \"YES! PLEASE TAKE AWAY MY PAIN!\" by now. I respect person X's opinion, but TAMP(on)(no, jk. haha) is one of DT's best ballads. The band creates an interesting effect by saying one line in the last line of a choice verse and repeating it in the first line of the chorus. The guitars are minimal here, for this is more of a keyboard-driven melody that sounds similar to 80s alternative pop and such at times. The way this song is structured is more like that of PoS, since the soloing is purely obligatory. That makes it very refreshing. \n\nThe protest anthem of the album, Just Let Me Breathe, suddenly jumps in next and throws you for a loop with its ADD hyperactivity. Lyrically, it deals with the media's sensationalization of celebrities such as Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain and the vast cookie-cutter that is our mainstream music industry. This track is incredibly danceable. If your spouse or sig. other is in the room with you while listening to this, you may feel the urge to do a jig or something. The main guitar line in the chorus is very syncopated and catchy, but the background guitar line is a little annoying and may take away your attention from the main melody for a moment. Also, the interlude has some really nasty vocal work from Labrie.( I mean gutsy, not sexual or gross) \n\nFinally, we get to the last ballad of the album, Anna Lee. The point has been made that this hearkens back to Pink Floyd, but I couldn't necessarily concur, since the only Pink Floyd release I own is Echoes. I can, however, confirm that it's the best ballad of the album and the one that leaves the most lasting impression. I say this because of the poignant piano intro, clever vocal arrangements, and sublime soloing, which DOES in fact sound like Pink Floyd a la Comfortably Numb, perhaps. Simply spellbinding song. \n\nTrial of Tears is the final song of the album and the guitar tone sounds amazingly similar to that of Eric Johnson in the beginning. The pre-chorus in Pt. I- It's Raining is really annoying because Labrie says 'raining' too much, but the actual chorus is decent and the verses flow pretty well, despite being a little slow. \n\nPt. 2 is an instrumental called Deep in Heaven, culled from the line \"Raining deep in heaven\" in the chorus of Pt. 1. This instrumental is not really all that noteworthy and is just a convenient way to segway from Pt. 1 to Pt. 3- The Wasteland. The Wasteland is the closing part to ToT and begins with a mesmerizing acoustic guitar lead before the pre-climactic vocals and the reprise of the line \"It's raining, raining, raining deep in heaven\". Repetition can be very positive as a means of emphasis, but it somehow manages to sound sophomoric here. Some lyric restructuring would've added more punch.\n\nSummarizing FiI, you could say that it is more of an accessible album, but at its conclusion the listener still feels as if he has followed the band through fields of wildflowers and patches of thorns, and that is part of what makes this album notable. It's not epic, but it's still quite progressive, and progressive qualities can often be construed as epic. \n\nI agree with sparse sentiments claiming this album to be underrated and, hopefully, more people will learn to like this album and/or stop avoiding it like it's the evil troll under the bridge.\n",
        "\nThe beginning of modern progressive metal lies in Images & Words. Although Queensryche, Fates Warning, and good ol' Crimson Glory were the first to \"take hold of the flame\" and marry Black Sabbath with Rush, Dream Theater took it to the next level with this release. Really, it'd be fair to say that all modern prog metal takes it's cues from Images & Words, Cynic's Focus, or Savatage's Streets: A Rock Opera, with the majority going the way of the flying-digits and warm melodies.\n\nAlthough I love Images & Words, it is a somewhat flawed record. First, the lyrical content is very much in the power metal vein, with lots of the fantastical imagery and simplified emotions that power draws upon. Bands like Symphony X and Stratovarius would take this to heart, but Dream Theater would shirk these for the most part on their masterpiece Awake, and become a better band for it. It's also a bit uneven, the good songs being literally some of the best ever, and the weak songs being just sort of there. It's also true that there is a LOT of soloing, between the frankly ridiculously proficient Moore and Petrucci they swallow up literally half of a song on occasion, and Myung gets a few cool bass runs to play with on top.\n\n\"Another Day\" seems a little too laid-back sometimes, although subsequent live versions would add force that the song requires to build to its substantial climax. In its defence though, James LaBrie is absolutely brilliant and those powerful vibrato-filled vocal solos are literally inimitable. Petrucci is in his element, particularly with the opening jazz-style solo and semi-duel with the guest saxophone player. On a trivia note, this was actually the first single and they shot a video for it, but it failed to break out and when \"Pull Me Under\" was released on a lark and became a hit, the band was as shocked as anyone.\n\nI've never particularly been a fan of \"Under a Glass Moon\" despite the truly crazy solo, as the song simply seems to not work on a certain level and never really get started. Dream Theater's music is very emotional, and this seems to lack that, Petrucci's poetic lyrics falling flat in a way that Myung's never seem to. Still, nothing really wrong with it, just lacking any edge and anything to really make it great, and I like the way it just builds and builds to the climax. Check out the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdswing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd version called \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdFly Me to the Glass Moon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for a real laugh.\n\nOkay, criticism over, time for raving.\n\n\"Take the Time\" is arguably the best song in Dream Theater's catalogue. Hell, I argue it myself, but time and time again this song is the only one that remains as constantly fresh as the Awake material. There is just so much energy! From the opening groovy bassline and ascending solo's, the first a fiercely metallic guitar storm and the second a truly formidable sounding keyboard solo onward, this song is so chockfull of invention and incredibly inspired hooks, riffs, solos, lyrics, and overall performances that it's almost inhuman. I love the opening sound-bites that Moore effortlessly layers until they achieve a rap-styled rhythm that James follows with his usual confidence and precision. People bitched about \"Honour Thy Father\", but they were doing it even back on this record. Of course, it was followed by an effortlessly mighty \"chaaaaaaaaaaaaaange\" that I'm sure even they'll forgive him. \n\nWe then counter the rapped lyrics with a metallic construct of considerable density before changing yet again into a thoughtful and sparkly pause before the chorus which features some more very memorable words. The chorus churns and really hits the sky, and the lyrical message is actually rather profound in a way. Plus, it's interesting to hear the band not going the usual way as far as the vocal melody goes. They elect not to do a measured progression and have the first \"take the time\" be very high and the second very low. I realize that I'll be here forever if I try to describe all the myriad twists and turns of this epic, so I'll just quietly point out the perfection of the false ending ride-out solo, the stark Wings-y perfection of the piano alerting you to the fact that it just isn't over, and the final triumphant charge to the endzone that marks a total contrast to the abrupt ending of \"Pull Me Under\". And all that in a little over eight minutes, as they manage to pack more into single digits than the entire 20 minute \"A Change of Seasons\"(not that I don't love that one too).\n\nI love \"Pull Me Under\" of course, which is really an unabashed rocker at heart. I love the stuttered intro, repeating over and over and actually foreshadowing the ending. That kind of narrative in music is hard to come by. Kevin Moore really restrains himself to a pulsing squawk that cruises over the chunky main riff, leaving the floor to LaBrie and his shamelessly dramatic interpretation of Moore's lyrics, up until the iconic chorus that really affirms everything that is good about metal, relentlessly anthemic and earthshakingly heavy. The solo is brilliant, a brethren to the \"Take the Time\" solo that actually manages to get better as it ends, a sublime little tag that lasts maybe five seconds before hitting that chorus again. And the quick cut-off? Brilliant and almost unprecedented. I've certainly never heard the like.\n\nI think Dream Theater's most famous song is probably \"Metropolis\", and with good reason. This is the most squarely metal song on the disc (call it a draw with \"Pull Me Under\"), and it's truly unbelievable solo blitzkrieg around four minutes in is insane. I repeat insane. Awesome guitar solo, awesome keyboard solo, awesome guitar and key run, BASS SOLO, more guitar and keys before cruising back in for the weighty finale. I skipped the opening of the song, which manages to be great on the strength of a recurring riff rather than simply blindsiding you with stupefying power like a \"Raining Blood\" or an \"Iron Man\". It leads to some tastefully crazy drum work from Portnoy and an understated yet complex riff/solo from Petrucci followed by one of James LaBrie's all time stand-out performances. \"There's no more freeeeedom...\" I have a slight problem with some of the wonky vocal melodies, but the rest of it is so damned good and so damned epic that I feel ashamed of complaining.\n\n\"Surrounded\" is catchy as hell, particularly the syrupy and infectious keys and perfect vocals. Kevin Moore always wrote very musically when it came to lyrics, and he achieved a real flow, particularly the \"light to dark dark to light etc.\" parts. I am sometimes a little bored with the intro to the song as well as the outro, but the glorious and joyful middle is more than compensation.\n\nThe final song, John Myung's \"Learning to Live\" really encompasses the rest of the album in a way. The bass runs in this song are genius, particularly the higher tone on the \"droopy\" bass licks in the first verse and towards the end. I love the way the thing segues from \"Wait for Sleep\" too, into that tricky drum beat and awesome keyboard run. The song is possessed by a very powerful chorus too, especially when James just takes flight followed by the truly unique guitar and key weaving that apes the intro keys. And man, that \"listening to the city\" part is serious doom and gloom \"Metropolis\"-style, with some very cool dark lyrics and crunchy riff. Skip past some awesome choruses and we reach a sublime ride-out, with some classical-styled keyboard and guitar solo's ending things over a gradually increasing sea of voices singing the main melody.\n\nI docked it points because it isn't something I can listen to all the time, but when I'm in the mood for it and I'm listening to the best parts of it... this is pure magic.\n\nStand-Outs: \"Take the Time\", \"Metropolis\", \"Surrounded\"\n",
        "\nLike Train of Thought, Scenes From a Memory is a double-edged sword, although it's much more tolerable than ToT because there are no mallcore elements here. The culprit on this album is Labrie's vocal delivery as it pertains to the different characters of this story. This is a concept album, but I'm not totally understanding the concept of it and I just don't like the way it sounds. It's just really fucking annoying for Labrie to be lamenting about Victoria, and for the narrator to say \"Open your eyes, Nicholas\" on the last song Finally Free, and so on and so forth. Who the hell are these people? If the band isn't going to make it clear to the listeners who these people are, then they should refrain from using their names in the songs, and/or just do away with listing the names in the sleeve altogether. It just makes it really cheesy. If they want to talk about Victoria, they should just refer to her in the third person.\n\nMuch of the time, the band just sounds so enthusiastic and \nserious about this story, but they don't make me feel it. Also, the excessive soloing detracts from the feeling of the music as well. Yeah, those guitar solos on Fatal Tragedy and Beyond This Life are great if you just isolate them in your mind and don't think it about how it's affecting the overall concept and emotion of the album. It's like saying \" Hey, let's sing about this girl who got murdered on Echoes Hill.....oh, nevermind, I'd rather go dancing at the Scottish festival down the street\". Three words: Pain of...(You know the last word if you know anything about prog metal)\n\nI will say, however, that the two ballads here are extraordinary and blow away any of the ballads on Falling Into Infinity. Through this Life and The Spirit Carries On are both incredibly emotional without being overdone and cheesy, and they should be on O'Sheaman's list of The Top Ten Prog Metal Songs of All Time if he ever were to create one.\n\nOverall, this album is worth picking up. It's really not all that bad. It's just overrated and a little cheesy, that's all. No Dream Theater album is unlistenable. You should never have to walk down the \"remedy lane to the garbage can\"(Thanks, stickyShooz. That was funny.) for any of Dream Theater's albums.\n",
        "\nOk, Dream Theater's 1994 successor to Images & Words actually exceeds it in quality, IMO. Whereas I & W has much more of an 'adult contemporary' feel(seriously, listen to Surrounded and tell me it wouldn't sound good on the radio), Awake is unabashedly metal. My dad said that it sounds like Journey and is not as emotional as other Dream Theater releases, but he has probably confused Dream Theater with Vanden Plas, Pain of Salvation, and others on numerous occasions, so I'm not taking him seriously. I'm not familiar with Journey, but this record IS certainly emotional. It's just overflowing with emotion, and not of the cheesy kind a la Scenes From a Memory.(You thought only power metal bands could be cheesy, didn't you?)\n\nThe lyrics on this album are Dream Theater's best if you ask me. They have a sort of tangible realism that is unmatched. \"The Silent Man\", especially, has some especially great lyrics...\"A question well-served. Is silence like a fever? A voice never heard or a message with no receiver?\" Ha, I love figurative language and riddles.\n\nThe music itself, though not the norm for Dream Theater, is their best. Every song is precise and concise for the most part and overall, this has some of the bands' best performances. John Petrucci is especially noteworthy because his guitar tone is absolutely lethal here. You don't have to be a death metal guitarist to have a lethal guitar sound.\n\nEvery song on here is classic material, whether it be the poppy Innocence Faded or the neoclassical instrumental Erotomania(which I find to be their best, though I haven't heard the instrumental Eve from the Silent Man single, which someone on the Pain of Salvation message board claimed to be their best instrumental). Though I suppose it can drag just a little, Awake is Dream Theater's most solid release yet. Even nu-metal aficionados and prog haters should love this.\n",
        "\nWhat an amazing piece of progressive metal! Some people say that Images & Words is their best album, but I think this is their best. This is their best because the album is full of variety, and features some great instrumental genius. Just imagine if you were given sheet music from guitarist John Petrucci as a novice guitarist yourself, you would never be able to figure out all the different song structures. Plus the drumming and bass playing is also top-notch. Overall, this is just a top notch album.\n\n\"6:00\" greets us first, and the drumwork in the beginning of the song is just amazing. And vocalist James LaBrie, while not necessarily possessing great range, hits every note on this song crystal clear. The tempo is upbeat, and it's a great upbeat feeling that continues into the next songs, \"Caught In A Web\" and \"Innocence Faded\". These two songs are very melodic and have really good solo work from John Petrucci, plus some nice fill work from drummer Mike Portnoy. \"Erotonamia\" is an instrumental that features many time changes and many interesting parts, and is one of the few metal songs I can say where I love the keyboard work. \"Voices\" is of the slower variety and clocks in at over 9 minutes, but it is a very nice listen, because it features some of James Labrie's most emotional singing - a definte strong point.\n\nNext is \"The Silent Man\", an acoustic-based ballad where you feel like you are in the studio with the band. James LaBrie's vocals shine again, as do the backing vocal harmonizing on this. \"The Mirror\" and \"Lie\", I didn't care for at first, because I thought that John Petrucci was trying to steal from Dimebag Darrell's riffset, but both songs have grown on me, because they are both headbanging, thrashy, and pretty good in the prog and songwriting category as well. \"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream\" is another great mellow song from DT, with more emotional-style vocals from LaBrie, and very well-written lyrics. \"Scarred\" is the only weak track on this song in my opinion, because little seems to change during the song, it just seems like DT meanders on and on for the 11 or so minutes of its length, beating the same parts to death. But that is a small complaint, because the album ends with the excellent \"Space Dye Vest\", which begins with a piano interlude and works into a very futuristic setting for almost the rest of the song, and it shows the tremendous variety and diversity that this band has.\n\nOverall, there are highlights nearly nonstop for this disc. This album is a can't miss for fans of power and progressive metal, and for metal fans in general. If you're a fan of intricate musicianship and songwriting - don't delay - pick up this album today!\n",
        "\nDream Theater's latest release Train of Thought, expands on the previous heaviness on tracks like The Glass Prison but maintains a more metallic, riff intense feel throughout most of the album complete with trademark Dream Theater sound. This album is sure to alienate a fair amount of their fanbase seeing as the compromised some of their progressive elements for a crunchy distorted feel with less guitar melodies. Simply put, its by far their most metallic release today. \n\nJames Labrie does an excellent complimenting the heavy sound of Dream Theater. Perhaps not his shining moment on vocals in this album, he needed to expand his vocal horizons with the bands newfound change into a metallic direction. Lyrically, Dream Theater are as good as ever I think! Most naysayers will just look out how this once extremely progressive uses heavy metal guitars as a basis for their sound. Mike Portnoy is smashing the drums excellently once again although his role on this album seems somewhat limited.\n\nJohn Petrucci is still writing some ultra-technical virtuoso leads that only the truly elite musicians can play but at times they are too technical. I am not totally agreeing with people who say that his solo's on Train of Thought lacked any sort of feel but I still think at times his solo's went overboard. Still very memorable guitar solo's on this album. One thing that was kind of disappointing was the lack of usage of Dream Theater keyboardist on this album. They hadn't disappeared but werent used very much. It seems a crime not mention John Myung who writes some pretty good bass lines although for the most part he is washed out like most of their studio efforts.\n\n\nThis Dying Soul, one of the better tracks starts off with this heavy chugging riff and long yet very memorable guitar solo from John Petrucci. I'd say the end of the first solo is one of his best moments on this album. The metallic onslaught cools down on the verse and follows by an excellent dual guitar harmony and graceful vocals on the chorus of This Dying Soul. This song has continues with heavy chugging guitar riffs, memorable leads and excellent keyboard work.\n\nEndless Sacrifice starts off with a great acoustic intro/verse reminiscent of A Change of Seasons with a nice intro guitar lead and builds in incredible soothing atmosphere complete with keyboards into a heavy, yet incredibly catchy chorus which I consider to be one of the better on the album. Continues with an excellent contrast of soothing soft verses, memorable chorus and then is followed by a heavier, more metallic interlude with flourishes of excellent keyboard work. \n\nHonor Thy Father has James Labrie almost rapping in a verse, which actually turns out better than expected. Not the best track on this album but still very good. A little light on guitar leads but still filled with more heavy guitar interludes, catchy choruses, tasteful keyboards but manages to differentiate itself quite well from the previous songs on this album. Vacant is a short little interlude piano driven melody with Labrie's more passionate vocals on the album with some excellent cello fills included. Easily the most beautiful track on here and worth a listen. Stream of Consciousness is a well-crafted piece of instrumental work. It takes you on a progressive journey of excellence even more than the other tracks on this album. The contrast to a groovy bass in the middle is just awesome like the rest of the song. In The Name of God is an excellent way to end the album. The chorus and the closing of the song/album are definetly highlights of Train of Thought. By now you would have recognized DT\u2019s new flare for tight metallic riffs accompanied with timely keyboards, amazing leads with an uncanny ability to create memorable moments in music. All in all, I expect this album to alienate some fans but I applaud Dream Theater for taking a new direction. Showing once again, they are masters at creating progressive music and not being afraid to take chances in the process.\n\nFavorites : This Dying Soul, Endless Sacrifice, In The Name of God\n",
        "\nLike a Borg cube, the \"modern\" sound of reliance on distortion and detuning instead of content, the acceptance of elements of grunge rock, mallcore, and pseudo-rap, and other nuances, have gone through the musical galaxy assimilating all kinds of things into its horrific, mechanical meaninglessness. Even Dream Theater, one of the shining stars of those who worship musical wankery -- which isn't necessarily bad -- has been infected.\n\nFor the most part, this is pretty much Dream Theater, and it hasn' degenerated into St. Anger or Opeth or anything. Their songs are still based on prog rock structures that extend well over 10 minutes, filled with timing changes, tons of solos from all instruments, soft interludes with keyboards, a few surprises, and what not. There's still plenty of wankery, but Dream Theater generally does it well. The lyrics are angsty, yet still reliant on Christian themes and aren't written in ebonics. \n\nHowever, they've added a ton of \"modern\" elements into the mix. Train of Thought is believed to be \"heavier\" than other Dream Theater albums, but that's mostly because of the chunky mallcore guitar tone and other crap. Most of the songs are beyond repair. The first song borrows from maybe Alice in Chains and Load-era Metallica, and is mediocre at best. This Dying Soul is horrible, and is full of blatant chugga-chugga \"get crunk\" mallcore. In addition, there's rapping into crappy distorted vocals inbetween Petrucci's blazing solos other standard Dream Theater fare, which strike me as out of place. Come to think of it, it does sound like Maynard with the \"I want to feel your body breaking\" chorus. \n\nEndless Sacrifice has plenty of shitty detuned groove, too but isn't as bad. Honor Thy Father goes from bad to worse with many of the same flaws prevalent throughout the other songs, including pseudo-rapping, and it sounds like something Korn would write if they ever got into prog-rock. Stream of Consciousness and In the Name of God are the only half-decent songs on here, but they're not much to write home about. When combined with the fact that most of these songs are really long, this album gets very grating.\n\nI'm sorry, Dream Theater, but you're not angsty mallcore kids, you're 30-40 year Berklee graduates and a bunch of Christian pussies, to boot. Get back to what you do best and be yourselves, or be sentenced to death -- by guillotine!\n",
        "\nI don't really know what Dream Theater was thinking with Train of Thought. They seemed to abandon their progressive metal influences and make an album laden with distorted, almost nu-metal like riffs. The songs for the most part are horribly long, and don't really need to be. The band more than likely could have cut down the length of each of the songs just a bit and squeezed a couple of more songs that they did instead of settling on only seven tracks.\n\nAs I Am, I don't see why this isn't a hit, its full of angst, distortion, and everything that nu-metal embodies, without really that much melody in LaBrie's vocals. I still really like this song, but I will probably become bored with it after consecutive listens, because there isn't really all the much special about it, except for the fact that at the end, Portnoy's drumming speed and signature time changes seem to have returned to form.\n\nThis Dying Soul is very promising. It could be a very nice song, except for one thing, Rapping from James LaBrie!! The chorus is pretty catchy and at times, the high range of LaBrie's voice sounds pretty nice. The guitar riff to this is rather progressive, until it gets to the rapping, then all of a sudden, it is a pure \"chugga-chugga riff\".\n\nEndless Sacrifice, exactly the same as This Dying Soul, could be very promising, except for the fact that the guitar riffing is rather simplisitic. This in my opinion is actually one of the best song on this album though.\n\nIn The Name of God, a mediocre song that is stretched into 15 minutes. If it were only about 7 or 8, you'd still have the same effect.\n\nStream of Consciousness is an extremely catchy instrumental, and was probably written for Liquid Tension Experiement, because of its extreme length. If this song had lyrics, it would be the best on the album. There is very little distortion here, and a lot of guitar and bass complexity like Dream Theater has been known for in the past.\n\nHonor Thy Father has mallcore written all over it. Just like the Great Debate, from the previous album, LaBrie's vocals begin to sound like Maynard's from Tool's, which is not exactly a good thing in my book, considering I rather enjoy LaBrie's high notes and falsetto. I usually just skip this track.\n\nVacant is a decent ballad, but also can get boring, and I usually skip this one too.\n\nThe reason that this album gets such a high rating is because hearing them live can help one appreciate them slighty more than if you were to just hear the album by itself. I believe that the last two Dream Theater albums have put them into a bit of a slump, and as paraphrased from the song As I Am, I hope they are still running up hill, and swimming against the current, and I wish that they won't be so fucked with future releases.\n",
        "\nI was a bit reluctant to buy this DVD at first since it's a bit more expensive than other concert DVDs (about $22 most places). Anyway, after finally getting it I was very pleased. Seeing A Change of Seasons alone makes the DVD worth buying. It's incredible. My only complaint for the concert overall is the cheesy effects frequently used in some of the songs (effects include the Dream Theater logo used in a variety of ways, camera tricks like mirror image view with Jordan on piano, etc). It detracts from the concert feel and it's a bit annoying at times. However, this certainly should not stop you from getting this! I particularly enjoy some of the video clips played along with the performance since they provide a visual representation of the story behind the album. Some of the extras aren't all the special, but the extra concert clips (in addition to the SfaM album live) are definately worthy of watching a few times.\n\nI definately suggest checking this out. The only negative comment I can make is the effects, and overall, this is really just a minor problem.\n",
        "\nDream Theater's sophomore album Images & Words is especially noteworthy because it marks the first album without WDaDU(When Dream and Day Unite) vocalist Charles Dominici, who, in my opinion, was vastly inferior to James Labrie and much more generic sounding. It's also noteworthy because it's the first and most likely only album of theirs that went gold(500,000 + albums sold). I've checked the sales of most if not all of their albums on metalsludge.com and none of them have come close to matching Images & Words as far as sales go.\n\nI guess the prog listeners all around the world(at least in The United States) were just overwhelmed with relief that James Labrie took over vocal duties and this album in particular is very restrained without having too much of a commercial sound. In other words, it's like Falling Into Infinity in its discrete use of soloing but is very similar to Awake and Six Degrees in its overall scope. There is plenty of great soloing to be found on this record, but it doesn't go all over the place like it does on Scenes From a Memory.\n\nImages & Words opens with the classic prog epic Pull Me Under, which UltraBoris even likes. I suppose there is sort of a power metal feel to it because of a very speedy interlude, but overall, it's just a great progressive metal song. Dream Theater has never done a song that just blatantly screams power metal, at least in my opinion. Nice song---long length, but it doesn't get boring. Lots of emotion and nice outro.\n\nThe second song, Another Day, is a short and sweet ballad that really wouldn't sound too out of place on a light rock station alongside the likes of Phil Collins, etc. It's a little under five minutes and it just sounds great. Also very emotional.\n\nFollowing this is the jazzy song Take the Time. This song has a lot of gritty attitude from Labrie and reminds me much of Lie from Awake. There's some really nice keyboard work here. Very flamboyant. \n\nSurrounded is next, and though many people don't like it much, I love it. It has an especially dreamy, nursery-rhyme type atmosphere that's very conducive to reflection and even napping. There's a very fast guitar solo on this song, but it doesn't have much of a foreground presence to it. It's hard to explain, but basically there are a series of very quickly plucked notes that happen over and over again for a minute or two. It's like a hurricane that sucks you into the emotional vortex of the song.\n\nMetropolis Part I- The Miracle and the Sleeper comes next and it is VERY impressive musically without getting on my fucking nerves. It begins with a smoky keyboard intro that is used often, to my surprise, at the beginning of certain professional basketball games to boost morale. I suppose it's just really damn catchy and inspiring. \n\nIn my opinion, to use that intro, even though it may be flattering to Dream Theater fans and Dream Theater themselves, it's almost blasphemic because I doubt most of the players on that court and even the vast majority of the people in the stadium could care less about the band and probably haven't even heard of them. Eh, it's just a little bothersome. I love the soloing on this song. Part of it reminds me of Sonic the Hedghog and then later there's this huge syncopated interlude that just bludgeons you in the head with its overall drive and it also stops and starts a lot until finally it winds down to a very abrupt couple of notes that give way to the calm atmosphere preceding it. The theme of this song would be revisited once again in Metropolis Pt. II- Scenes From a Memory, obviously, though I have no idea who \"The Miracle and the Sleeper\" are.\n\nUnder a Glass Moon is a very nicely paced song that's equal parts regular and epic. Much interesting guitar work is to be found here...some of it sounding suspiciously similar to Steve Vai. This is not as impressive as Metropolis Pt. I, but it's still excellent. \n\nWait For Sleep is Dream Theater's shortest song ever, clocking in at 2:31, and it's very emotional and nicely done. I'm glad that it wasn't some technical instrumental or anything, because technicality should be spread out over a longer duration in my opinion. Otherwise, there's often not enough time for interesting transitional moments and such. This song has very moving piano-playing.\n\nLearning to Live is a nice closer that utilizes the melody from Wait to Sleep to help drive the concept of the album home. This is the only instance of the reusable riff phenomenon on this album. Whereas on Awake, it appeared several times, it only happens once on this album, and I respect that. I don't recall this song being particularly technical, but it has quite a lot of drive and it fits the album well.\n\nThis isn't my favorite Dream Theater record(that honor goes to Awake), but I do like it quite a lot because of its tasteful use of soloing and emotion. It's a little hard to get into because it's so mellow though. I know all of Dream Theater's stuff, generally, is mellow, but this album is especially mellow and probably will appeal more to the baby-boomer generation who grew up with bands like Yes, Be Bop Deluxe, King Crimson, etc. Unfortunately, though, it seems as though older people mostly are the ones who like Dream Theater and are highly familiar with them. I consider it a duty of mine to spread the word about Dream Theater and progressive metal, currently my favorite genre of music.\n",
        "\nAfter firmly establishing their niche in the progressive metal genre with 1992\u2019s \u201cImages & Words\u201d, Dream Theater released this somewhat ambitious follow-up. Fortunately, they succeed more often than not. The overall length of the album may turn off some interested listeners, but fear not; on no occasion did I find myself overly bored with any section of \u201cAwake\u201d.\n\nThe opening few tracks, \"Caught in a Web\" in particular, don\u2019t tread very much new ground, reminding everyone of the consistency that DT has retained over their career. Around fifteen minutes into the album, however, the excellent \u201cErotomania\u201d kicks the album into high gear. Great work all around, especially on the part of John Petrucci. Instrumentals are always a safe bet with Dream Theater. The remainder of the \u201cA Mind Beside Itself\u201d trilogy (Voices and The Silent Man) demonstrate a solid song writing ability, something that is occasionally overlooked when one listens to DT. \n\nNext up, \u201cThe Mirror\u201d is a great example of how the band gets criticism for recycling riffs too much. An excellent set of riffs, mind you, but a bit repetitive. \u201cLie\u201d busts out with some unexpected attitude from James (I know that sounds a bit cheesy) on vocals, and of course, a great Petrucci solo. Also, one can\u2019t leave out mention of the best lyric of all time, \u201cNever been much of a Doubting Thomas\u201d. \u201cLifting Shadows off a Dream\u201d, besides having an annoyingly long title, is one of the more forgettable tracks on the album. \u201cScarred\u201d reveals that John Myung is as capable a bass player on the slow songs as he is on the fatser ones. Finally, the keyboard dominant \u201cSpace-Dye Vest\u201d wraps thing up. If I\u2019m correct, the band refers to this as \u201cKevin\u2019s song\u201d, so they don\u2019t play it live anymore. That may be a good thing because the samples ruin a lot of the promise of this song.\n\nIn closing, it takes a while to fully appreciate this album, but the rewards are by no means far and few between. Seek out \u201cImages & Words\u201d, \u201cA Change of Seasons\u201d, or maybe even \"When Dream & Day Unite\" first if you\u2019re a new listener, then proceed to uncover the band\u2019s best attributes without too much filler on this diverse work.\n",
        "\nDebut albums are always eccentric and primitive(almost always), and WDaDU is no exception. What we have here is a totally different manifestation than what Dream Theater is widely known for. I say this because the band does not yet have the controversial James Labrie to tackle singing duties. Charles Dominici is the vocalist on this album and he's living proof as to the drastic effect a vocalist can have on a band and/or album and why they are held in such high regard and called 'frontmen'. \n\nDominici is remarkably inferior to Labrie, in my opinion. He's not as resonant, doesn't have as much conviction, and can't nail high notes as effectively. He would be more effectual if he tried a different genre of metal or music, such as pop or alt rock because he doesn't have the depth and chutzpah to pull this off.If Dominici had remained Dream Theater's vocalist throughout their career, it only leaves me to wonder if DT would have been as successful and popular as they are today. Sure, guitarists, drummers, bassists, and keyboardists are essential, but when the vocalist isn't adept, it's very grating and makes everything else happening in the music a nonentity. That's why SO many otherwise excellent albums on this website have lost points---it's because of the sub-par/terrible vocals; Dominici sounds like your average clean power or traditional metal vocalist. There's nothing distinguishing him from the vast crop of other singers out there in the progressive genre and in metal in general. \n\nUnfortunately, WDaDU is somewhat sub-par musically speaking as well. The overall tone of the guitars is somewhat muffled and soft, unlike on later albums where each instrument booms with confidence and charisma, burying itself in your subconscious. On a similar token, the riffing is quite competent, but not the soloing. Everything is presented in a much more primitive, compact package here, which is stifling for listeners thoroughly acquainted with the band's later work.. Also, the keyboards play a far lesser role here and don't have that squealing, spacey tone we're all accustomed to.\n\nOne of the few highlights is the instrumental Ytse Jam, a tune that has gained a peculiar amount of fame in the Dream Theater universe, even spawning a website bearing its name. It's not their greatest work, but it's very aggressive. In keeping with the overall songwriting layout of the album, it cuts straight to the chase, not opting to enthrall the listener with unwarranted grandeur. A bit of a Malmsteen/shred metal type romp with dynamic drumming.\n\nBasically, what we have here is the groundwork for much classier, more opulent offerings from a band who is continually evolving and adapting, yet trying to keep their sound and image intact. Often I wonder if all players involved with this intentionally held back to pique fans' suspense as to what comes next and to totally blindside everyone with Images & Words. Ability is never and has never been something that people question about Dream Theater, but how exactly is the band choosing to present its ideas to listeners? What are they cutting and pasting?\n\nPotential for excellence is written all over the instruments on this record and DT has impeccable consistency, but we'll never know if the band could have pulled off something more defining. That sense of wonder in itself is enough reason to buy this album. Personally, at least, I find all the 'what-ifs' of the world to be very gratifying.\n",
        "\nA Change of Seasons is often thought of as a prog metal masterpiece or even the greatest prog metal song ever, and although it's not my favorite Dream Theater song by any means, it's still very good. After reading the track length for the title track, I thought this would be a total wankfest, but I was sadly mistaken. All the parts of this song fit together like hamburgers and french fries. It begins with an instrumental that gives way to all the other parts of the songs, each one having it's own identity. \n\nThe lyrics deal with personal growth, life, and the arrival of the next generation and they are some of DT's best. I also enjoy how the first part is called The Crimson Sunrise and the last section is called The Crimson Sunset. How appropriate!\n\nAfter this, it's just a bunch of covers, covering everyone from Elton John to Queen. The only one I'm really interested in is the Led Zeppelin medley, which has the songs The Rover, Achilles Last Stand, and The Song Remains the Same. They don't do such a bad job on it. In fact, I think Labrie tackled the vocals pretty well, especially for The Song Remains the Same. The guitars are a little heavier on all songs of the medley, but nothing can beat the originals. I just wish they would've played some Zep songs that were a little more popular, such as Stairway to Heaven or The Ocean. \n\nThe only real part of The Big Medley that I look forward to listening to is the part covering Carry On Wayward Son by Kansas. They play the guitar parts almost flawlessly, but I'm very disappointed that Labrie didn't sing it. He could've pulled it off. :shakes head:\n\nWell, this has some killer music for an EP. I certainly have never heard of an EP having a 20+ minute song, much less one that is considered a masterpiece. Hell, chronologically, this is a full album. Man, Dream Theater never ceases to impress me. Are they capable of putting out a bad album? :ponders:\n",
        "\nAfter the critically-acclaimed, yet overly sappy and indulgent Scenes From a Memory, Dream Theater got their shit together and released their most ambitious album yet, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. I don't know how they came up with the title of this album, but I must admit that it is turbulent. This isn't a bad thing, though.\n\nThis is a 2-disc album, with Disc 1 being dedicated strictly to straightforward progressive metal songs(oxymoron, eh?) and Disc 2 consisting of the 42:04 title track, which is divided into 8 parts.\n\nThe first disc begins with The Glass Prison, which tackles the topic of alcohol addiction. It doesn't get much better than this folks. This is Dream Theater's heaviest, most ass-kicking song ever and stretches out for almost 14 minutes. The guitars rage at a malicious, almost thrashy speed and the vocals give a nod to Rush at times. Complaints I have about this song are the static at the beginning and the grunted vocals during choice verses in section 2 of the song. Overall, this is a DT classic and is bound to be on the next fan club best of/compilation CD.\n\nFollowing this song, we have Blind Faith, which compromises speed for a calm, sleep-inducing tempo. One of the catchiest choruses to be found is on this song and the guitar solo near the end is totally heavenly. Misunderstood is the first ballad-like song of the album and it again flows at a very tranquil speed. Much notable keyboard work is on this song and the guitar interlude later in the song is absolutely WICKED. Man, I've never heard DT or any band in recent memory use the guitar tone that surfaces later in that song. It reminds me of an anime horror film or something of that ilk. Simply spellbinding.\n\nOk, enough time chatting about ONE RIFF. Haha. The next song is The Great Debate, which is slightly shorter than The Glass Prison and not nearly as speedy. This song deals with stem-cell research and presents both sides of the argument without forcing one view or the other upon the listener. I'm glad that's it like that. Otherwise, Labrie and Co. could've had some tough legal shit to deal with. This song is very brooding and is initially reminiscent of Red Harvest in the overall atmosphere. Nice apocalyptic-sounding guitar work near the end as well. \n\nFinally, we have the last song of the first disc, Disappear. What a spooky, grim song this is. It's the only average-length song on the first disc and has a VERY creepy guitar tone. This song may disturb your tranquillity if you're already on the edge. This song is arguably more depressing than Space-Dye Vest. Both are beautiful songs, but sometimes it's a bummer to hear such a downer of a song at the end of an album.\n\nOk, if you were listening to this entire album in one sitting, you obviously wouldn't stop after Disappear, so next you would listen to Disc 2, the title track. This is DT's most grandiose song/disc yet and sure kicks the hell out of Scenes From a Memory, IMO.\n\nIt begins with Overture, which has a distinct march-like sound that often sounds like Pomp and Circumstance. Next is About to Crash, which has an excellent, uplifting guitar melody that soon gives way to War Inside My Head. This is some really heavy, caustic stuff here, almost as much as The Glass Prison. Gotta love that thrash-riffing again. \n\nNext is The Test That Stumped Them All, which again has some killer thrash-riffing and the first cuss word on the album(shit). The only detriment to this song is the narrative, talkative-styled verses that deal with loved ones of a mentally ill boy discussing treatment options. The vocals are just incredibly silly and annoying.\n\nOtherwise, this is a good song, though. Following TTTSTA comes the fifth song, Goodnight Kiss. This sounds like a nursery-rhyme and is very dreamy. I think it would be neat if Dream Theater made an album consisting solely of songs like Goodnight Kiss. It's that unique and calming. \n\nThis is merely a short interlude to Solitary Shell, which again tackles the subject of mental illness, dealing with a boy who is possibly autistic and spends too much time to himself, not interacting with others. Musically, this song is stellar, the piano-playing amazingly fresh and crisp and the acoustic guitars like a Celtic hymn or shanty. This song has the most memorable chorus from the whole album and is one of DT's catchiest songs ever.\n\nAfter that comes the reprisal of About to Crash, which again has those godly, Rush-inspired riffs, played with more fervor. The best part of the song is the climactic guitar thumping with the abrupt piano interlude. Great neoclassical-sounding stuff right there.\n\nFinally, we have the last song of the entire album, Losing Time/Grand Finale. There's not much musically to speak of in this song. It's just a closer, and it's achingly pretty.(I would've said 'achingly beautiful', but I didn't want it to seem like I was copying Paradox in her review of \"Space Dye Vest\") I love the way the vocals gradually build up to the ending of the album, gaining and losing volume continually.\n\nWell, that's it folks. At the end of this album, it is clearly the end. It's not like Scenes From a Memory where it has this little symphonic reprisal with some dude on the news talking or anything like that. After the last word of the song, there's nothing left to look forward to. Anyway, this isn't my favorite DT release, but I feel inclined to give it a 100% out of my deep respect for it. You see, if it wasn't for this album, I may not have gotten introduced to the many other excellent bands that I listen to and I would not have the knowledge of metal that I now have. Someone recommended Dream Theater to me one summer during summer school, so I decided to order SDOIT from Columbia House. I've had metal CDs before buying SDOIT, such as Metallica's Master of Puppets and Fear Factory's Obsolete, but SDOIT was the catalyst for me to become a metalhead, and that's what I consider myself now. What a blissful state of metallic wealth I'm in today just because of this one album.\n",
        "\nNOTE: I am reviewing a pirated version of the album. I am positive that this is the real thing and I fully intend to purchase the album when it is released tomorrow, as I advise you to do as well.\n\nWell, here we are: the newest release from Dream Theater! Like many, Iwas eagerly awaiting its release for many months, and finally, here it is. I was so excited to hear it, that the second I burned it I retreated to my room and blasted it at full volume.\n\n\"What the FUCK is this?! RAPPING?!!\" was my initial reaction. And indeed, a horrible revelation was bestowed unto me: our favorite prog vocalist, James LaBrie, actually RAPS at one point on the album. No, I am not kidding. Believe me, I wish to God I was. But it's true. And not only that, the first song, As I Am, is, in fact, PSEUDO-MALLCORE. Jesus Christ, what has happened to this band?\n\nAs I soon found out, they are still alive and well. Despite the brief moments of St. Anger influence, we find that there is much influence drawn from earlier albums like Awake. The technicality and instrumentation is still as good as ever. The lyrical content is questionable and (in the case of As I Am at least) shitty, but, really, there's nothing new there. As for the songs themselves, they are some of the longest and most improvised songs the band have ever released, but also some of the most accessible. They sound similar to The Glass Prison (which gets reprised here), or The Mirror.\n\nAs I Am kicks us off with the characteristic single, and I will be the first to tell you: this song sucks. It isn't total garbage, it's just kind of mediocre. The lyrics are atrocious and mallcore, and the keyboards are nonexistant. That's one thing about this album: Jordan Rudess hardly does anything on this album. The song continues with a catchy chorus and James' James Hetfield imitation (!), and then the first uttering of the word 'fuck' on any DT album. Yes, that's odd. Well, this isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst song on here.\n\nWe continue with This Dying Soul. This is the song with the aforementioned rapping. LaBrie goes into a wild Linkin Park impersonation here and raps. I am not joking-he sounds just like the guy from Linkin Park. Son of a bitch, that makes me mad. Well, other than that, the song is very nice, with a nice SFAM-style lead. This is a continuation of The Glass Prison, which is why thy lyrics are split into parts IV and V. The song gets reprised here as well. Excellent song, except for the rapping.\n\nThe next song is Endless Sacrifice. What we have here is a decent ballad (a rarity!) with A Change of Seasons-style leads and emotional vocals. The chorus is pretty good. This song reminds me very much of Voices off of Awake. A gigantic instrumental 'Dance Of Eternity' freakout ends what is probably my second-favorite song on the album.\n\nHonor Thy Father is next. The song opens with a drum solo that sounds suspiciously like the opening to Painkiller, and it goes on to be a nice midpaced, heavy song with nice riffage and pretty good vocals. LaBrie raps here as well, which makes the song worse than it has to be. Not bad, just kinda mediocre.\n\nAfter a short interlude in the form of Vacant, we are taken to the best song on the album: Stream Of Conciousness. This song owns in every way imaginable, especially the wild improvisation. One of the bands best instrumentals yet, this is definitely going to be a Dream Theater classic and is recommended to everyone!\n\nIn The Name Of God is our closer, and it is the longest single track on any Dream Theater full-length album. This isn't the best song on here, but it is a great little number with excellent guitars and drums. There have been a good number of 'freakout' sections in these songs, and this one is no different, going all over the place in its engrossing solos.\n\nThat's it, the album is over, and it sure was a great ride. There were some pretty bad moments (I still can't get over the rapping), but overall, this one's a keeper. If you are remotely interested in Dream Theater or prog metal at all, I would highly recommend giving this a try.\n\nHell, even nu-metal fans might love this.\n",
        "\nWhat can I say, this is a masterpiece! John Petrucci and the guys released in 1999 what would be called the best prog metal concept album since Operation Mindcrime, and it is well deserving of the title. Scenes From A Memory tells the story of a man named Nicholas who is haunted by the spirit of a young woman who was murdered in 1928. He goes to a hypnotherapist to discover what it means, and discovers a disturbing secret. I won't go into the plot too much here, but it is pretty much impossible to follow without reading the lyrics as you listen. \n\nNow, the music. Each and every member of Dream Theater is a virtuoso at what they do, and on SFAM they really shine. Portnoy's mind-blowing drums and Petrucci's solos lead the album as LaBrie tells the tale. Songs like Overture 1928, Home, and Finally Free make for instant DT classics, while others, like Strange Deja Vu and The Dance Of Eternity (lots of Metropolis Pt. 1 references, as that song was the prequel to this album) are solid songs that can take you away or pump you up, depending on how you listen. Dream Theater doesn't make headbanging music, not many prog bands do. But when all is said and done, you'll probably start singing along.\n",
        "\nAfter initially listening to this album with the expectation of another \"Awake\" or maybe even \"Scenes from a Memory\", I came away disappointed. It seemed that Dream Theater was slowly but surely starting to move away from the epic tendencies that previously defined them. However, I recently took it upon myself to get rid of any prejudices, and simply listen to this as if it were from a different band. My, how that paid off. I came to the realization that this album is definitely strengthened by the power of its individual songs (well, the first disc at least), and that the pretentiousness of trying to create a masterpiece was left out for a good reason.\n\nWhile certainly integrating different aspects of music into their sound, nothing sounds like it clashes or forces a sense of uneasiness onto the listener. The band's technical proficiency is up to par as always. James Labrie seems to stick to a style of singing that doesn't rely on high notes, which may be attributed to his slowly deteriorating voice. No worry, as he doesn't take the spotlight nearly as much as in the past, and avoiding over the top performances is a good thing. Jordan Rudess is undoubtedly cementing his place in the band, with a display that could easily rival that of \"SFAM\". The first disc displays the experimental side of the band more so than the second, which contains an epic in the style of \"A Change of Seasons\". This easily rekindles fond memories of the DT of past years, but not so much as to seem unoriginal or lacking in ideas.\n\nHighlights are the album-opener \"The Glass Prison\", \"Blind Faith\", and to some extent, the first half of \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\". While not as mesmerizing as one would expect, this album rewards patient listeners who are willing to evolve with the band, and expect the unexpected on occasion.\n",
        "\nA Change of Seasons is one of the greatest songs ever made. Dream Theater shall never ever top it. Ever. Now that I got that out of the way, this EP (if you want to call it that, it's as long as many full length albums) shows one good thing and one bad thing.\n\nThe good thing: The title track. Holy shit, I died and went to heaven listening to this. The song does not get boring at all, despite it's hefty (23 minute) length. There are several different segments. The song begins and ends with an acoustic guitar. There are heavier parts, and these are the ones that make this song shine for me. Around the 2-5 minute area is my favourite part of the song because of the different melodies used and how they fit so perfectly with one another. The whole song fucking rules though, and I know for sure that this band will not top this (at least in my opinion).\n\nThe bad thing: The covers. What the fuck. These are a waste of time. Zeppelin was great, no need to bastardize them by performing a bad cover. Queen sucks. Fuck them. The covers are really pointless and not very well done.\n\nThe diagnosis: Buy this album, listen to the title track and turn it off. Repeat daily.\n",
        "\nOne thought: is this album too close to heaven?\n\nI know, sometimes Dream Theater try to hard, but most of the time they keep it on the edge and manages to pull everything off just right. When they succeed, sure the world keeps spinning, but to an ordinary human - time stops!\n\nAnd this time they nearly pulled a 100% and remade (according to my opinion of course) Images & Words. Most of this albums is so tight, so excellent and the riffs and beats are created with so much skill and experience that they live their own lives and tell their own stories.\n\nMost of the songs on both discs are great, especially pieces like: \"My Glass Prison\", \"Misunderstood\", \"The Great Debate\" - \"Solitary Shell\" & \"The Test That Stumped Them All\". But there are some things I personally think they could have done better - like the intro on the first disc, its just noisy static! I mean sure, nice sequel to \"Metropolis Pt. II\" where the albums ends with the same static, but its relly just annoying... \n\nAnd Im just going to pick a little on the beginning on the second disc too: the first song / the first songs: Whats this \"March-band\" feeling I get? These \"war\"-drums and Rudesess' prodigious whirlwindishlike clinking on the keyboard? By erasing this part, the seconds disc could have been perfect.\n\nSix Degrees of Inner Turbulence contains great material and really great lyrics (although they might imply a little too much about the USA and their religion). But no matter - this is a great album!\n",
        "\nThis is simply an incredible album. Easily the best Dream Theater album I\u2019ve heard, and easily one of the best albums ever too! After Metropolis Pt. 1: The Miracle And The Sleeper back on Images And Words, fans started when part 2 would come around. The answer is this album. And what and album it is!\n\nOn the musical front, there simply isn\u2019t a single finger to put on this album. Everything good from previous Dream Theater albums is here. From Petruccis incredible guitar playing, to Myungs merciless bass shredding, to Rudess\u2019 perfect keyboards, to Portnoy brilliant drumming is here. James LaBrie still isn\u2019t the greatest singer the world has ever seen (heard, really), but his performance on Scenes From A Memory is one of his better ones, and his voice really does fit the music quite well. The lyrics could be a chapter of their own; the story of Scenes From A Memory is well worth figuring out, as it adds further to the depth of the album.\n\nNow, this album has wankery. And lots of it. So if that\u2019s not your sort of thing, this probably isn\u2019t the album for you. Petruccis riffs are amazing, and licks like the ones at 2:10 and 2:14 of \u201cFatal Tragedy\u201d are simply jawdropping. The chemistry between the guitar and Rudess\u2019 keyboard are amazing to listen to, and incredible trade-offs between the two instruments are blasted out in abundance in almost every song. The endless solos on this album are all catchy as fuck, plus the sheer speed of many of them is most impressive. The bass supports the keyboards and guitar very well, and even has some incredible solo moments, like in \u201cThe Dance Of Eternity\u201d.\n\nIn conclusion, if you don't have this album, you're only doing yourself a huge favor by running out and buying it as fast as humanly possible. For it is one of the most enjoyable albums to be released in newer times. Simply a must for any fan of music.\n",
        "\nA Change of Seasons is absolutely godlike. Pure and simple. It only has one good song, but that doesn't matter, as it's the GREATEST PROG METAL SONG ever made.\n\nA Change of Seasons, the song mentioned earlier, is 23 minutes long. It has everything from godly guitar playing, to phenomenal bass playing, to fantastic drumming, to epic keyboard playing, to powerful vocals. This is an epic, technical song that almost sounds orchestraic, and any fan of prog metal, and indeed, any genre, will find this to be purely amazing. It starts out with a slow, atmospheric guitar melody, then blossoms into a technical warzone, with wild improvisational sections that lead you on one track at one time, then does something completely different every time you yhink you've heard it all, and it never faisl to keep you interested. LaBrie's vocals on it are top-notch and fit the song well, with his high-notes adding feeling and emotion to the song. And of course John Petrucci leads with his soaring licks and dead-on precision.\n\nThe rest of the album is a bunch of covers. They suck, but no one is forcing you to listen to them, now, are they? A Change of Seasons is a sensational album well worth it for the title track alone. If you don't have it, go out and buy it right now. I'm serious. I can't explain to you the goodness of this album unless you hear it yourself.\n",
        "\nDream Theater have always made good live albums, but with this release they somehow managed to top even Once In A LIVEtime. This three-disc live set is a Dream Theater fan's Holy Grail. The band's musicianship is as virtuositic (is that even a word?) as ever, and new keyboardist Jordan Rudess proves himself as a more than competent replacement for Derek Sherinian.\n\nThe first disc contains nearly all of Scenes From A Memory (!!) and a solo by John Petrucci and Theresa Thompson. The performance of SFAM is great, and is sometimes preferable to the studio versions of the songs. The second disc contains the rest of SFAM, Metropolis Part I, The Mirror, Just Let Me Breathe, a bastardized version of Acid Rain, Caught In A New Millenium (a weird hybrid mix of Caught In A Web and New Millenium), Another Day and a keyboard solo by Jordan Rudess. The band keeps with their fantastic performance throughout the disc, especially in the songs The Spirit Carries On, Finally Free and Metropolis Part I. Finally, disc three contains the A Mind Beside Itself trilogy (Erotomania, Voices, The Silent Man), Learning To Live, and, of course that old Dream Theater classic, A Change of Seasons.\n\nI only have a couple of problems with this album. For one thing, they didn't play Pull Me Under, Ytse Jam or Take The Time. Another thing is that James LaBrie's voice cracks a few times (but this is really too insignificant to be a problem). The awesome setlist and the all-out awesomeness more than make up for this though. If you don't own this album, go out and buy it right now. You won't be dissapointed.\n",
        "\nI'm going to ignore the 2nd half of this album and get straight to the important part: the title track. A Change of Seasons (or ACOS for short) is an impressive and complex piece of work from this talented prog-metal quintet, and clocking in at twenty-five minutes, it's fairly easy to see that a bit of thought went into this. There are seven distinct parts to this song, and each one is significantly different than the last, which helps to hold one's interest through this incredible journey. I greatly prefer the instrumental sections over those including James Labrie, who, impressive range aside, sounds a bit unsure of his vocal ability. \n\nAnyone who has serious doubts concerning DT's right to be called a metal outfit will realize just how heavy they can play, while at the same time, avoiding repetitive riffs and boring compositions that plague more than a few contemporary metal bands. I'm constantly amazed by the production of this album, with each instrument sounding crystal clear, and the atmospheric effects actually adding atmosphere, as opposed to taking up a void in the background. \n\nWhat else is there to say about Dream Theater that hasn't already been said? Talented? Sure. Innovative? Without question. Finished? Satisfied with their already astounding discography? I think not. I can't wait for future releases from a band that so willingly embraces a dying genre.\n",
        "\nDream Theater has long been recognized as progressive metal's favorite whipping boy (now sharing the spot with Opeth..), yet rarely was the band actually guilty to the extent of what they were charged by the critics.... up until this album. \n\nUnlike most of their previous work, a good deal of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance is the embodiment of everything DT's detractors despise: overlong compositions with too much fat on them, uncomfortable vocal moments, good ideas that never come to full fruition. Being a 2-CD album, with lyrical concepts dealing with mental illness/struggle, Dream Theater had the potential to create a rich, expertly sculped album that could draw in the listener to dive deeply within in it and revel in it's expression. Instead, many parts of Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance tend to be a chore to listen to, and this hinderance seems to grossly compete with the great points of the album for attention. Rather then meshing layers of smooth oil paints together in a complex and beautiful sonic swirl - as can be found on their best work - Dream Theater now has more messy watercolor then ever before, occasionally even straying way off the canvas sloppily onto the wall.\nThat's not to say the good points of the album are completely overshadowed. On Six Degrees, DT has finally progressed their sound somewhat, integrating longer and more experimental song structures, balancing out their heavy and light elements better, and adding some more varied keys, programming, and orchestration to the mix. There are great moments throughout both discs, and moments of brilliance. However, in almost every song with great moments there are also awkward, forced sounding, and generally bad parts that spoil or come close to spoiling the song, and this can make for a hard listen.\n\nThe Glass Prison opens the album with promise, turning from a classic sounding keyboard/guitar harmony intro into a fast double bass assault shifting into cruise control when James LaBrie's computerized vocals enter from opposing sides of the speakers. Very nice, and more then a sign of creative life. Unfortunately, the first hint of things to come is contained later in the track, as the band is not able to pull off all 11 minutes while retaining the same quality and unity throughout. The chorus-like lines in the song, for the most part, have a very positive and uplifting melody to them, which wouldn't be bad in itself but the problem is that The Glass Prison is a song based around the struggles of alcoholism. The victory over addiction only comes at the end of the song, and so there are a good deal of odd sounding parts beforehand that don't fit the lyrics whatsoever. Blind Faith is next, and is excellent for the most part, with airy programming and instrumentation that brings almost mountain/canyon like imagery to mind. The different passages that pop up repeatedly show a great amount of chemistry within in the band and keeps the music richly layered and interesting. The chorus is another matter however, being much too hard rock sounding to fit in well at all with the rest of the atmosphere, but the band makes it a focal point. Misunderstood is another good piece lyrically, dealing with the misconceptions of an outsider's view of fame, and the isolation of the person being misunderstood. Again, unfortunately the music - while being competant on it's own - does not fit well with the subject matter, sounding instead like some lazy ballad in poetic contentment. The vocal melodies, like others on the album, sound uninspired and thrown together. Next comes The Great Debate, and this is where everything comes together for Dream Theater. A 13 minute analysis and summarization of the controversial stem cell research issue, the song manages to be haunting, rocking, and intense at once, with John Petrucci's lyrics exploring both sides of the debate and simply presenting the facts. There is a little Tool-esque sound to parts of the song, but the band retains it's own vision well and fuses their ideas perfectly to make The Great Debate the best song on Six Degrees. The verses are almost sinister, the sampling of various people's comments on both sides of the issue emerging from different speakers is engaging, and all the lyrics are presented in a contemplative, yet heavy context. The band also flexes it's instrumental muscles well between the lyrics, the bass and guitar lines creating a good base atmosphere to work off of and take the song to places justifying the length. The last song on the first disc, Disappear, is also good, one of the darkest songs on the album lyrically and musically. The keyboards and guitar are spacey and filled with misery, Jordan Rudess's keyboard work being the driving element of the song and carrying LaBrie's sad lyrics about the loss of a loved one very well.\n\nWhile the first disc of the album is good though annoyingly inconsistent throughout the songs, the second disc is somewhat of a disaster. The 42 minute title track of the album takes up the entire second disc and is divided into 8 smaller songs. Very obviously, this is quite an ambitious effort, but unfortunately also the kind that usually ends up a masterpiece, or a complete pain to listen to thanks to excess filler within. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance is, for the most part, of the latter group.\n\nOverture starts the disc, and when looking at the dark subject matter - which includes the effects of war on the mind and antisocial helplessness - of the other 7 songs that make up the title track, the song makes little to no sense. Instead of the song sounding like a prelude to various explorations of hard mental struggles, it has an almost Disney-esque motif to it despite the more seriously theatrical feel, and in some plain goofy parts I keep expecting a lounge singer to croon a bit about the joys of a good martini. After 6 minutes of the laid back, semi classical instrumentation going absolutely nowhere, About to Crash comes in, betraying it's title and lyrics by sounding at times like sugary pop-rock - and the extra sugar on LaBrie's voice here may help prevent a calm stomach. War Inside My Heard and The Test That Stumped Them All thankfully darken the mood a bit - though the former is much less interesting then the latter, which features some good acting by LaBrie as different characters, and some of the catchiest music to be found on the second disc. Unfortunately, by the time the heartfelt, somewhat disturbing ballad Goodnight Kiss rolls around it becomes completely apparent that the title track, when treated as one track, is incredibly weak and poor in structure - sounding as if the band recorded 8 mostly different songs and taped them together with a thin adhesive of instrumental excess. Fortunately the situation improves as the end draws near, with Solitary Shell easily being the strongest section of the piece, featuring excellent lyrics and great, atmospheric guitarwork. The final two tracks that make up the title song vary from mediocre to pretty good, the first being a reprise of About to Crash that is not too much better from the original, and the second, Losing Time/Grand Finale manages to close the second disc with more well written lyrics and a tasteful amount of climatics, eventually fading out gently with Jordan Rudess' soft synth.\n\n\nSix Degrees of Inner Turbulance is not a terrible album, but it came much closer to being so then it did to being as good as it could have been, especially being a 2-CD album. Way too much left of the middle here, in way too many places.\n",
        "\nThe band didn't want to follow up their great conceptual opus with merely another run of the mill (for DT anyway) studio. They felt the need to do something more and I'm glad they felt that way.\n\nSome long time hard core DT fans don't like the new direction this album took. Bands change with time and so does their sound. If you can't deal with that then you should just shut up and listen to the old releases you do like.\n\nThe first disc would make a great album all on its own. \"The Glass Prison\" epitomizes the new, more aggressive direction the band is taking. \"Blind Faith\" is so-so, but nothing to scoff at. \"Misunderstood\" is good except for the last three minutes or so. All the electronics and weird effects really aren't necesary. \"The Great Debate\" is simply superb. Musically it is awesome, but I think the lyrical accomplishment is even more impressive. Both sides of the stem cell argument are presented without actually stating which they as a band or as an individual song writer stand on the issue. If an opinion would have been stated it would perhaps alienate people of opposing views from enjoying the song. \"Disappear\" is a very nice slower song reminiscient of \"Space-Dye Vest.\"\n\nThe second disc doesn't appeal to me as much as the first, but a 42 minute long composition is impressive nonetheless. The high points for me are \"About to Crash\" and the reprise. I also greatly enjoy the juxtapostion of the light-hearted sound of the acoustic guitar as compared to the dark lyrics of \"Solitary Shell.\"\n\n. . . and why a gong? I suppose it is probably a \"why not have a gong?\" sort of thing, but it works no matter how unexpected it might be.\n",
        "\nThis DVD is a must have for all Dream Theater fans. It is simply amazing. They play their conceptual opus to near perfection. What an awesome concert that must have been to see in person. A twenty four minute marathon of a song . . . AS AN ENCORE!!!\n\nI have only a few complaints about this disc. (1) I think they should have included the whole entire concert. The additional songs are great, but the whole thing would have been superb. I understand if that would have required two discs and the record company just didn't want to go for that, but I can dream can't I? (2) James's vocals suffer in a few places, primarily in \"Finally Free.\" I understand the rigors of preforming a two hour+ set every night, but it is a bit disappointing. (3) The behind the scenes stuff sucked. The interviews with some of the fans were cool, but I think that disc space would have been better spent on additional songs from the concert. (4) Some of the effects are kinda cheesey. Specifically the flipping John Myung up-side-down effect. (5) You can't hear John Petrucci on the commentary. Apparently he sat too far away from the microphone. John Myung hardly ever speaks so you essentially only get three out of five members of the band in the commentary. I also think they should have recorded commentary for the bonus tracks as well.\n\nDespite these short comings this is still a great DVD.\n",
        "\nWhen you think of Dream Theater's music most think of there much revered (perhaps overly so) break out success \"Images & Words,\" or their concept album opus \"Scence From a Memory,\" or the single 42 minute long musical composition \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.\" Few mention \"Awake\" right off. No one will say this isn't a solid album, but usually it is overshadowed by DT's more ambitious projects. \"Awake\" is, in my opinion, their best album. It is definitely there most underrated and perhaps their most complete. It has everything from the epitome of progressive metal \"6:00,\" to one of their heaviest songs \"The Mirror\" and \"Lie,\" to an example of the marathon \"wankathons\" they are known for (and their critics loathe them for) in \"A Mind Beside Itself.\"\n\nPerhaps one of the reasons I like this album is because of the way it flows from one song to another without there being a blatant segue. The tempos of the songs rise and fall over the course of the album while the \"reuseable riff phenonmenon\" ties it all together. \"6:00,\" \"Caught in a Web,\" and \"Innocence Faded\" are all pretty similar in tempo. \"A Mind Beside Itself\" encapsulates another tempo wave, building through \"Erotomania\" and \"Voices\" and then settles down into a nice acoustic number \"The Silent Man.\" \"The Mirror\" and \"Lie\" take things to a new level of heaviness. \"Lifting Shadows off a Dream,\" \"Scarred,\" and \"Space-Dye Vest\" gradually bring the tempo down to a close.\n\nI. \"6:00\" / \"Caught in a Web\" / \"Innocence Faded\"\n----------\n\"6:00\" to me is the epitome of what prog rock/metal is. Extremely melodic and technically demanding. These are all three great songs. They can either be very deep and difficult or easy to listen to depending on one's mood. I think James gives some of his best vocal performances right here.\n\nII. \"A Mind Beside Itself\"\n----------\nPerhaps the best DT instrumental and the best, most introspective lyrics all rolled into one. \"Erotomania\" might seem like an over glorified scale, but it works. The solo near the end definitely showcases John Petrucci's talent. \"Voices\" has some of my favorite lyrics ever. They are so very introspective and really put the writer's heart and mind right out in front of everyone. Perhaps why I like them most is because they don't have an answer to the problems the writer faces. Many musicians think they have an answer to everything, but this shows that they are just as human and just as confused about life as everyone else. The fact that I generally skip \"The Silent Man\" when listening to this song in no way makes it a bad song. I think maybe it is just something of a let down after the greatness of \"Erotomania\" and \"Voices.\"\n\nIII. \"The Mirror\" / \"Lie\"\n----------\nTwo great heavy songs. Musically they seem to be one longer composition, lyrically divided in two. I particularly like the bass riff at the end of \"The Mirror.\"\n\nIV. \"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\" / \"Scarred\" / \"Space-Dye Vest\"\n----------\n\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream,\" while it isn't bad, it isn't anything spectacular either. I think \"Scarred\" is DT's most underrated song (appropriately coming from their most underrated album). At first it was just \"another\" 10 minute DT song, but it gradually grew on me until it has become one of my favorites. I especially like the outro. \"Space-Dye Vest\" is simply beautiful. What else is there to say about it?\n",
        "\nThis must be one of the greatest live albums of all time! Dream Theater is one of the few bands I know that sounded just as good if not better live. I was sceptical about this album after I listened to Once In a Livetime which was released a few years earlier. LaBrie's voice seemed to give out rather easily and the song selection was sub-par, but here, he hits all of the notes that he had been able to hit for the earlier albums, especially the two tracks from Images and Words. I wouldn't have been surprised if this was disappointing, but DT doesn't fail too often. The instrumentation of John Myung and John Petrucci is always dead on. Portnoy improvises a bit, but he's seem to have mastered the art.\n\nSince Scenes From a Memory happens to be one of my personal favorite albums, I thought I'd give this a shot. Not only do all of the tracks sound close to replicas of the originals with James put a new twist on some of the vocals.\n\nThrough Her Eyes is probably the real standout from the first cd. It sounds a bit sappy in the studio, but adding drums to the end of the track made it one of the premier ballads of progressive metal.\n\nMetropolis Pt. 1 has always been one of the bands heaviest songs, and although some of their recent music has gone in a different direction, they still kick maximum ass at performing this old favorite. Myung's bass playing here is phenomenal!\n\nThe Mirror is probably the single heaviest Dream Theater track. I was really surprised that LaBrie could still hit some of the notes to this song. Fans of any type of metal are sure to love this one.\n\nAcid Rain is a Liquid Tension Experiment track. Why shouldn't DT do it? The only member missing is Tony Levin, and I believe Myung is great enough to fill his shoes. Although its only an instrumental, it remains one of the heaviest tracks recorded by DT members.\n\nAnother Day is absolutely brillant on this album. I loved it before, and I think I might like it better on here. Some may think that saxophone doesn't make for a good metal song, but DT prove that they obviously don't care, giving the saxophonist free reign to add more of the instrument and more virtuosity to the song.\n\nJordan Rudess' keyboard solo doesn't need much said about it. Its proof here that he is more than likely Dream Theater's best keyboardist, slightly ahead of Kevin Moore.\n\nDon't have Change of Seasons? No need to worry about it now unless you want the covers. On Live Scenes, the band does the entire track flawlessly! Its a pure masterpiece!\n\nThere is no way that any fan of the genre could not appreciate this album, especially since its over 3 hours of music. If you like DT even remotely, buy this immediately.\n",
        "\nThis album is considered to be a waste of money by most fans, but it is probably tied with Images and Words as my favorite Dream Theater album. Some of it does sound slightly commercial, but when you are a progressive metal band, there really isn't such a thing as being commercial. Most people's problem here is that the album is nearly half ballads. IMO these are some of the bands most spiritual and enjoyable songs.\n\nNew Millenium starts the album off on the right foot. A very up-tempo track with an extremely catchy feel to it throughout. This is one of the few heavier tracks on the album, but captures the power that James LaBrie is capable of singing with.\n\nYou Not Me is sort of one of the bands heavier ballad type songs. Probably my favorite off of the album. Containing very harmonic vocals and backing vocals, along with excellent lyrics makes it an all around great song.\n\nPeruvian Skies is a bit of a disappointment. I've never really been able to get into this song. It does have some nice bass work, but it just seems to lack emotion. IMO the worst song on the album.\n\nI am confused as to why Dream Theater made a video for this song. It is a very heart-felt song, but sounds kind of sappy at times. Pretty nice lyrics, but doesn't sound like something the band should make a habit out of doing. Its a pretty decent song, but hearing modified versions of it won't make me or too many other Dream Theater fans happy.\n\nBurning My Soul is where Dream Theater gets back to their basic ass-kicking formula of old. Without a doubt, the absolute heaviest song on this album. Very doomy, has a sound unsimilar to any other of the bands songs, but it I would be very please to hear songs this damn good in the future from these guys.\n\nHell's Kitchen is the basic Dream Theater instrumental. Has a bit of an Erotomania feel. Not a bad song, but they have better instrumentals than this. I am glad that they decided not to drag this on though for any longer than they have to. Dream Theater, as UltraBoris puts it, has been known to wanker for the sake of wankering at times, and luckily they don't do it here.\n\nLines in the Sand is probably the bands longest song ever that doesn't show any really exceptional musicianship. Most of the lyrics here are sang by King's X's Doug Pinnick. This sounds more like a King's X song than one for Dream Theater, so I'm not really too big of a fan of it. Its just too long, and rather uneventful.\n\nTake Away My Pain IMO is by far the band's greatest ballad. Its amazingly emotional, and beautifully written. I believe its supposed to be about the death of John Petrucci's father, and it inspired him to write some magnificent lyrics. My only complaint here is that the guitar solo isn't long enough, it's absolutely amazing, it just ends way too soon.\n\nJust Let Me Breathe is a bit of a corporate song. It contains all of the anti-MTV elements of alot of bands and the fact that they even acknowledge the existence of MTV and the deaths of Shannon Hoon and Kurt Cobain make this song worse than it already is. Not bad musically, but not much lyrically at all.\n\nAnna Lee sounds rather popish, but I still rather like it. IMO it sounds like something that Pink Floyd would have done. The way that LaBrie sings on this track reminds me much of Floyd. Once again another song that is very uncharacteristic of Dream Theater. This song however is rather nice lyrically, but lacks really any musicianship.\n\nTrial of Tears honestly does not seem like a 13 minute song. This track probably displays James LaBrie's voice at its best. Its a pretty nice way to end the album.\n\nMy mainly complaint about this album, like many others is the restricted drumming of Mike Portnoy, he is not really allowed to do what he is capable of here. All of the other Dream Theater elements are still here though, and I still believe that this is an album worth having.\n",
        "\nThis would be one of the worst albums of Dream Theater if it were a full lenght album, but this is not a full length album, its just an Ep, and for an ep is has some damn good tracks on it. A change of seasons is one of dreams theaters greatest songs ever, it manages to be 23 minutes long and not repetive. The intro and outro acoustic guitars set a great mood, very dark and creepy. The riffs in the song are very metallic, and the singing is dream theater at its best. A great track which can be listened to over and over again. \nAnother track that stands out is the Led Zeppelin cover track, Dream Theater did a great job covering these three songs. They stuck true to the origonals but added a different feel to the tracks. Overall the tracks are heavyier and more electric than the led zep origonals.\nThe last track has only one flaw, they didn't sing the chorus from carry on my wayward son by kansas. I was really hoping they would sing this chorus rather than just playing the instrumentals. But other than that the song is great. Overall this is pretty good for an EP, I wish it would of had one or two more origonals on it. The music on it is great, definatly worth a listen. This album is also better than Falling Into Infinity and Images and Words.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, I would like to say that this album is called Once in a Livetime. In some areas, such as John Petrucci's guitar playing ability, this album shows improvements from the studio. Another high point of this album is how the band chooses to show their talents by dedicating tracks to solos for Petrucci, Portnoy, and Sherinian. One of the flaws of the album is the voice of James LaBrie. He has an excellent voice, but on this album it kind of gets away from him at times to where what he is saying cannot really be interpreted if you have never heard the song before. I was also slightly disappointed in the track selection. They have most of their best songs on here, such as Lie, Pull Me Under, and The Mirror(which are all done amazingly), but they felt that they had to include the majority of the often criticized album A Change of Seasons. Its kind of strange though how at the end of Take the Time, they play the guitar solo to Free Bird(IMO way better than the original) and in another song, they play the opening riff to Enter Sandman. Unless you are a diehard Dream Theater fan, I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this 2-cd set, but its a pretty good deal if you can find it for about the price of a used cd.\n",
        "\nSome may complain that this cd isn't the typical 70 minutes that Dream Theater usually throws out, but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. The production of David Prater, as some would say, \"is just as good if not better than that of Kevin Shirley\". Images and Words is an even more technically extreme album than nearly all other Dream Theater albums. It possibly contains the three best songs to begin an album ever.\n\nThe album begins with Dream Theater's signature song Pull Me Under. It is possibly one of the greatest progressive metal songs of all time. Even Ultraboris loves this song, and that is really saying something. It is one of the bands few heavier songs that doesn't really do that much technical \"wankering\" as it is referred to by some. A beautifully written song which makes a great introduction for Images and Words.\n\nAnother Day is usually criticized because of the use of the saxophone. The band thought this song would be their biggest hit instead of Pull Me Under since it sounded rather charateristic of the music of that time period. It is personally one of my favorite songs of all time and without a doubt my favorite ballad by Dream Theater. It is just very soothing to hear Kevin Moore's brilliant keyboarding mixed with the saxophone.\n\nTake the Time goes back to the band's forte, extreme technicality. Its pretty hard to distinguish the keyboards from the guitar on this track, simply because they sound similar, but nonetheless it is an all around excellent upbeat effort by the band. This song contains some of LaBrie's best vocal work and also shows many people why John Myung is considered one of the best bassists in progressive metal.\n\nSurrounded is just a bit of a sleeper compared to the first three tracks, but is still rather enjoyable. This is another track where extreme technicality is not blatantly practiced. This is sort of a midpaced song that is more focused on lyrics and the voice of James LaBrie than anything else. Not musically one the best, but lyrically it is rather exceptional.\n\nMetropolis is another one of the premier tracks on this album. It contains a fantasic intro that amazing is occasionally used at the beginning of Los Angeles Lakers basketball games, it is that inspiring! This track focuses more or Mike Portnoy than anything. The drumming on this is track is technical enough to make Neil Peart proud. Although nearly a ten minute song, I don't think its possible to get bored with the song.\n\nUnder a Glass Moon is not one of my personal favorites, as it just seems awkward on this album. It has a bit of an ancient asian civilization feel to it, just doesn't sound very metal-like. All in all not a bad song, just not really a good Dream Theater song.\n\nThere is only one reason that I am disappointed with Wait for Sleep and that is because it is too short at under three minutes. This is also one of the premier ballads of the band and once again displays some beautiful keyboarding from Kevin Moore. A very relaxing song that is once again lyrically beautiful.\n\nLearning to Live is the typical ten minute plus song of Dream Theater. There are times on this song where they just seem to drift into a different song, something that Ultraboris likes to call \"wankering for the sake of wankering\". I enjoy the bands more technical work, but not even I can really understand this one.\n\nIf you are looking for something different, but something that won't make you want to go skeet shooting with the cd, i recommend checking this one out. If you really liked Awake or When Dream and Day Unite, you'll probably want to make this a part of your cd collection that recieves regular play.\n",
        "\nFor those who like Dream Theater's heavier work should be able to enjoy this album. Its not often that a debut album can be this good. Although Charlie Dominnici's vocals may not be as enjoyable as James LaBrie's, this album all in all should be taken more seriously. Some may agree that some of the bands best songs are on this album.\n\nA Fortune in Lies is perhaps one of Dream Theater's heaviest songs, with an amazingly powerful intro, with the usual amazing musicianship for the band. Lyrically it isn't one of the better songs, but in terms of most enjoyable, it ranks towards the top.\n\nStatus Seeker does not sound like anything that the band would do. Very well written and very catchy, almost textbook 80s metal, but certainly not one of Dream Theater's best musical perfomances.\n\nThe Ytse Jam is still a concert staple for the band today. Perhaps the heaviest instrumentals ever recorded my any of the members. This is textbook Dream Theater here, extreme technicality.\n\nThe Killing Hand's intro makes the song seem like a very soothing acoustical ballad, but after about 30 seconds, it changes into what sounds like the typical power ballad of the 80s. Pretty well written song, but not really that interesting.\n\nLight Fuse and Get Away is probably the worst title for a song that the band could think of, but cetainly is not a bad song. John Petrucci's warp speed playing on this song makes it one of the best on the album. Its also one of the best vocal perfomances by Dominnici.\n\nAfterlife IMO is the best song ever written by Dream Theater. Not only is it well written lyrically, but it displays some of what each member of the band does best, and that is play there instruments. Without a doubt this is one of the best solos ever for John Petrucci. With such impeccable time changes this song couldn't possibly be hated.\n\nThe Ones Who Help to Set the Sun is a bit disappointing. It takes nearly 2 minutes to get to even instrument playing. A rather annoying siren sounds thoughout the beginning of the song turning most listers off of it before the song really kicks in. It is a shame too, because, this would be a rather enjoyable song if it cut down on its time. Dream Theater has quite a few long songs, but this one doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose eventhough it isn't anywhere near the bands longest.\n\nOnly a Matter of Time is once again an amazing song, probably about 3rd best after Afterlife and Fortune in Lies. Once again it is very well written and performed magnificently. The lyrics to this show the intelligence of the band as it is truely inspiring, yet also kind of depressing, as it shows you how easily power can be obtained, yet how it can debilitate.\n\nDon't be fooled by the pictures inside of the booklet, this album can rival images and words and awake in terms of heaviness. When Dream and Day Unite is a must have for any fan of progressive metal. It is possibly Dream Theater's most complete album.\n",
        "\nFalling Into Infinity is said by most, to be the worst Dream Theater Album... Though I admit that it is below average for Dream Theater, it still is a very good album...\n\nIt does seem quite obvious that the record company strived for popularity in some of the songs, but most are still masterpieces. In the end, FII is probobally the least accessable of all of DT's albums...\n\nThe album stats with New Millenium, which I find to be very catchy, and I really do like the intro... It then moves on to \"You Not Me,\" which to me seems like an obvious attempt at accessability. It's an alright song, but below average for DT. Next in line is Peruvian Skies, which is a masterpiece. I found Holllow Years to be slightly boring. Burning my Soul is a great song. Next in line is Hell's Kitchen, and I can honestly say that this song makes the album worthwhile by itself.\n\nHell's Kitchen is a fantastic instrumental piece that shows incredible emotion in Petrucci's playing.\n\nHells Kitchen fades into \"Lines in the Sand\" which is a catchy, and good song.\n\nFrom here on, the rest of the album gets slightly boring...\n\nOverall, FII is still a brilliant album, it supports some of the best DT songs (Peruvian Skies, Hells Kitchen etc.) but it has it's bad spots. I can see why people may not like it, but I really dont think it deserves to be called a bad album in ANY way...\n",
        "\nOkay I know hearing Dream Theater on studio albums is godly. Now here's something you wouldn't expect: watching this DVD is even more. The deal is that they play the entire Scenes from a memory live, and to make sure the viewer follows the story there's some film clips along with it, and they even got a person on stage playing the hypnotherapist.\n\nI can say that it's a out of this world-experience to watch these guys go off on stage, especially in my fave tracks Beyond this life, Fatal tragedy and Dance of eternity. James sings like a god and the rest.. well you can imagine.\n\nThere's also bonus tracks, including the whole A change of seasons and A mind beside itself.\n\nThe only thing I found not as interesting was the \"behind the scenes\" and the photo gallery.\n\nBuy this fucking thing right now if you call yourself a Dream Theater fan.\n",
        "\nI recently read a review that said this album is just a show-off of the musicians' talents, and had no feeling at all (although that is a common critic line on Dream Theater). That reviewer could not have been more wrong..\n\nI think he was incapable of understanding how it actually would sound, if this was the case. It would be lots lots LOTS of solos melted together with no structure, I would enjoy to personally spit this reviewer-person in the face just to let him know how stupid he is.\n\nFocusing on the actual album though, it is some over-the-top-and-more playing by some of the greatest musicians in my eyes - however as I said this is NOT an \"exhibition\" there's loads of structured riffs and leads here which still manages to sound like nothing else you've heard - if you're not a long-time Dream Theater fan that is - cause there are some riffs and words taken from \"Metropolis pt. 1\" off the 'Images and words' album, but don't think this is some cheap trick - the purpose is to give \"flashbacks\" to that song since this entire album is the sequel.\n\nWhat else is there to say, this is one of the most wonderful albums I've heard, and Dream Theater's best to date I think. (although Six degrees.. struck me like a bolt of lightning)\n",
        "\n From the very beginning of Awake, the listener can tell that they're in for a different experience. Though the prog elements are mostly retained from Images & Words, this does not sound as much like a traditional neo-prog album. There is a definite metal atmosphere in this one.\n\nThe previously mentioned opener, \"6:00\" is an excellent way to start off, though it's a bit of a jarring experience. To some, it is a perfect example of how Dream Theater forsakes structure and melody for instrumental wanking. For me, it's a great SONG. The solos and time changes never get in the way of a clear melody and hook. Both \"Innocence Faded\" and \"Caught in a Web\" are solid, catchy tunes with well-defined hooks. Something even an anti-progger could get into.\n\nBoth of the epics on this album are great, though \"Scarred\" is a little too long for it's own good. The heavier songs are awesome and the instrumental, \"Erotomania\" is both technical AND entertaining. Kick-ass! And the album closer is just achingly-beautiful. LaBrie's overbearing, operatic vocals actually fit this track, though they probably have no right to.\n\nAll in all, this is a classic album showcasing Dream Theater at their best. Well worth the money. Even the lyrics have improved.\n",
        "\nThere seems to be something missing from this album: something that got lost in the technicality - the actual songwriting! Only two songs on here manage to be catchy and coherent, and the rest are a complete muddle. An attempt at prog-rock goes horribly awry as song structure is deemed meaningless in favour of fucking around on instruments, simply because they can.\n\nThe two decent songs are \"Burning My Soul\" and \"Peruvian Skies\". The rest is completely horrible. \"Burning My Soul\" actually suckered me into getting this album (gotta love being totally disappointed). Dream Theater can be funny like that - they have one absolutely amazing song (\"Pull me Under\" from Images and Words) and the rest of the time, they are a completely different band.\n\nIf you really like to listen to people that can play technically brilliant music with the approximate feeling of a doorknob, this is the album for you.\n"
