        "\nOf all of the albums I've been wanting to review in like forever, none of them have made me rewrite it and delay it more than At the Gates's fourth studio album \"Slaughter of the Soul\". I mean, it's on my personal Top 10 Favorite Metal Albums of All Time for a reason. I've been listening to it back to back since the first time I've heard it, and I even have a lyric from the album as part of my signature on the MA forums. But there are two reasons why this took me forever to write a review for it. One is, similar to other albums, it was hard putting in the right words on how much I loved it. And another is, I'd had to explain its influence on the metalcore scene, and whether or not that should affect the enjoyment of this album. We'll get into all of that in a bit, but first, I need to set the scene here.\n\nMelodic death metal is exactly what you'd think. It's death metal, but going on a more melodic route in the sound and composition, as well as taking major influences from traditional heavy metal. Dismember was the first to lay the groundworks of it with their debut \"Like an Ever Flowing Stream\", and Carcass was the first to go all-out with this new style in their fourth album \"Heartwork\". During this time, ATG had already released two albums that technically were melodeath, but still had some OSDM influences in them. Beginning in \"Terminal Spirit Disease\", however, is where things take a turn with the band. TSD is noticeably more melodic and harmonized than the previous two records, and though it isn't perfect, there was something about that sound that the band knew they could tap into even further. And this is where we get to 1995, with the release of their fourth studio album \"Slaughter of the Soul\".\n\nThe album opens up with the track \"Blinded by Fear\". The track starts off with some industrial noise that creates a low-tuned and tensed atmosphere, which is pushed even further with some banging. This goes on for 30 seconds before we hear a man talk about being blinded by the worlds within us, and it is at that point where the rest of the instruments kick in. The guitar riffs do sound similar to that of the previous album, in which they sound heavy, but also melodic in style. However, it is rather apparent that the melodic portion of the riff is more strongly executed and firm than in TSD, so the death metal style composition of the riff is less threatening and more easy-going in its sound. The drumming is also intense, but weakens itself a bit as a way to let the melodic riff lead in. While the blastbeats aren't the most threatening, the beat patterns are still played well enough to lead off the instruments. The bass is also great, as the bass play is perfect at mixing following along the guitars with laying a thick foundation. And this melodic-orientated sound in the opening track is presented in much of the first half of the album. The tracks \"Slaughter of the Soul\" and especially \"Under a Serpent Sun\" are the clear highlights, as the perfect mix of heaviness and melody make them not only the best songs in ATG's discography, but also the best songs in melodic death metal period. The second half of the album is noticeably more heavier and leans more towards that tradition death metal style, but is still melodic in sound, particularly in the tracks \"Suicide Nation\", \"World of Lies\", and \"Need\". And that's not even including that beautiful acoustic track \"Into the Dead Sky\", which is right up there with Lord Belial's \"Forlorn in Silence\" in terms of my favorite acoustic songs. SOTS not only has some revolutionary instrumentals in the melodic death metal genre, but they also officially bring At the Gates up from a good death metal band to an official leader in the melodic death metal genre along with In Flames and Dark Tranquillity.\n\nBut that's just one element on this album. Tomas Lindberg also does the vocals on this album, and they're a bit more controversial. Tomas's vocals nowadays aren't that good, and bring the new ATG albums down quality-wise. And even in his prime time, some people weren't really on board with his yelping vocal delivery. However, in a strange way, I feel like there really is no other vocal delivery that can enhance the tracks more than Tomas's style of vocals. To see what I mean, let's take a look at the album's magnum opus \"Under a Serpent Sun\". This track pretty much has everything I love about melodic death metal with its mix of heavy riffs and melodic melodies, and Tomas's vocals are perfect for it. The yelping brings in more pain in the more heavy riffs, whereas the emotional yells in his voice make the more melodic riffs more powerful. And let's be real here: We've all got a bit teary when Tomas shouted \"Under a serpent sun... we shall all live as one!\" for the first time. And that's just one song. In the rest of the tracks, Tomas's unique vocals bring in more emotion and power in the instrumentals, and make the melodic parts even better. And that makes his deteriorating vocals today all the more tragic, because if his vocals sounded this good back in 1995, then one could only imagine how they would've sounded like had his vocal performance got better.\n\nNow, unlike most reviews I've done, I don't really have a whole lot to say about the lyrics. It's songwriting is simple, but also descriptive and worded well enough to tell good stories, and the melodic riffs and yelping vocals only further enhance these stories. Instead, I guess I will use this paragraph to talk about SOTS's influence in metalcore. Since the genre's inception, a lot of metalcore bands have taken much of their influence from At the Gates and especially this album. Hell, Bring Me the Horizon in particular had their album \"Count Your Blessings\" be half SOTS-inspired riffs and half breakdowns. However, a lot of people argue that this only affects the likeness of the album, as knowing it led to the creation of many core bands that many in metal scene don't like, that makes it bad. I would have to disagree. I mean, it's like arguing the Beatles's song \"Helter Skelter\" is bad for being an influence on Charles Manson's heinous beliefs. At the Gates didn't had the foresight of the metalcore scene in 1995, since at that point, the genre was still at its infant stage and was still mainly rooted in punk. And even if they did, I don't really think that would've mattered in the bigger picture, as the main intention was to be even bigger and better than TSD at the end of the day. It's future influences might be problematic for some, but for me personally, I don't think it affects the overall quality of the album in of itself.\n\nSo yeah, when you get down to it, At the Gates's \"Slaughter of the Soul\" was revolutionary in many ways. Not only would it perfect the melodic death metal sound that it, along with many other bands, tried to perfect, but it would be a kickstarter for the melodic death metal craze that lasted through the rest of the 90s as well as a good portion of the 2000s. Dark Tranquillity even released The Gallery nearly two weeks after SOTS, so the genre was basically destined to be huge. While there are many melodeath metal records I love, there is none that I love more than \"Slaughter of the Soul\".\n",
        "\nLovers on one side, haters on the other, Slaughter of the Soul became one of the quintessentially most controversial albums. First of all, because of the change in the sound of the band, which, after all, is a bit radical considering the compositions of the legendary Alf Svensson, since in Slaughter of the Soul the guitar riffs are characterized by melodic hooks and catchy rhythms, unlike the chaotic, strange and slightly dramatic sound of albums like The Red in the Sky Is Ours or With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness.\n\nI'm not going to deny that At the Gates with this album is responsible for creating the metalcore cliche, because it's the same as defending the indefensible. Many, if not all, metalcore bands of the early 2000s took the Slaughter of the Soul formula along with their influences from little-known metalcore bands of the 90s to create a sound characterized by being at times extremely melodic. It is not bad that the sound is melodic, the problem is when it is overexploited to the point of exhaustion. If we judge from this point of view, even The Jester Race by In Flames is also partly to blame, but at least that album has something more of its own in its style, ironically In Flames would later allow itself to be absorbed with that style to the point that they would become an exaggeratedly melodic band.\n\nReturning with At the Gates, they are a band that when I discovered it left me speechless. To this day I am still a devoted fan of The Red in the Sky Is Ours, not only because it is a timeless album, an undeniable masterpiece, but because it really broke the mold not only in terms of composition, but also in creating something unique in its style and that would influence many bands in the future. It is an album with a podium as high as you can imagine. With Slaughter of the Soul that doesn't happen.\n\nOf the entire album I only highlight three songs, \"Blinded by Fear\" is an immediate and undisputed classic, the guitar work is memorable. \"Under a Serpent Sun\" is also an excellent and unforgettable song, where the guitars also stand out and the drums give it an extra edge, making the song even epic. And the last one to stand out is \"Need\" which is probably the most brutal song, so to speak. The drums are incredible and the rhythm sections stand out a lot, plus their closing gives it a different touch and complements well with the last song. But the other songs sound too similar to each other, as if they were filler. The least interesting song is the instrumental \"Into the Dead Sky\" which doesn't really offer anything great, it doesn't give me an emotional or melancholic feeling, it seems to me to be a piece composed almost at random and that they included at the last moment, on the other hand \" The Flames of the End\" if it has more reason to be, for its melancholic sound and for witnessing the end of the album and at that time, of the band.\n\nI don't side with either of the two sides, it's not an excellent album and it's not a terrible album either, it's an album that stands alone as something enjoyable, almost bordering on mediocrity but it's At the Gates, I don't let to be fond of them for this album, which in the end is not terrible, but it borders on disappointment.\n",
        "\nMan, the number of times I've decided to review this album and then not gone through with it is crazy. On the one hand, At War with Reality can surely be defined as the most interesting At The Gates reunion album, not only because the others have been pretty boring but also due to a few tactful changes to the former methods of the Swedes. Then again, the interesting elements of this 2014 effort might not be seen as so fascinating by every fan, particularly not those wishing for some return to the earlier death-oriented climes of the first 2 albums. You see, I consider the themes on At War with Reality more alluring than the music itself, and that's saying a lot for a line-up that contains 3 fifths of one of my favourite bands of all time, namely The Haunted. Not to mention Tomas Lindberg, THE melodic death metal vocalist. And...er, Martin Larsson, who has been important to At The Gates but not too much else.\n\nOkay, I'll divulge my interest in the themes right away: South American writers, especially Jorge Luis Borges. Borges wrote mostly a kind of magical realism spliced with science fiction, twisting the fabric of our world with sly tricks of pen and tongue rather than actually outlandish concepts, so that one began to doubt the truth of reality within just a few pages of his extremely slim stories. Lindberg acknowledged the importance of these ideas to this album in interviews, but the song titles 'Death and the Labyrinth', 'The Circular Ruins', and 'The Book of Sand (The Abomination)' already stood out to me, as they are titles (either exact or mildly altered) of Borges stories. Tropes like labyrinths, recurrence, mirroring, and unknowability return in these works, here supplemented by parts from On Heroes and Tombs by Ernesto Sabato, a quote from which makes up the rather arresting spoken Spanish introduction to the album. The lyrics might well pass you by if you haven't read the narratives, but I gather the overarching point of At War with Reality was to point out how language can alter our reality, how truths are often multiple, and how the superficiality of the modern world threatens to drown out its meaning.\n\nThe modern At The Gates sound, however, is singular, and may be called superficial if you are feeling mean. I'm not one of those people who hates Slaughter of the Soul, even if I agree that we didn't need 1000 bands ripping it off for the following 2 decades, yet I guess that At The Gates stopped being a band that progresses when they reformed and made another album with an approximately similar style and a mildly different character. Conciseness is one thing that remained quite clearly over the 20 years the quintet was away, evident from the song lengths since only a couple exceed 4 minutes and also tangible in the velocity of the faster parts, which intersect with quite bouncy melodeath parts that you cannot fail to have heard on 'Suicide Nation' or 'Cold'. More peaceful moments exist alongside the rush of 'Death and the Labyrinth' and 'The Conspiracy of the Blind', with the rather soothing intros of cuts like 'Heroes and Tombs' and 'Order from Chaos' feeling like a new feature. Indeed, the album as a whole feels lusher than Slaughter of the Soul attempted to be (and probably lusher than it could have been regarding recording quality), employing a few strings and alternative tones to the beefy riffing mode of the guitarists, something which the band would expand on the following album. 'City of Mirrors' quite pointedly exists as a band-constructed interlude, utilizing the twin guitars to build up a melodic soundscape, not like the rather separate instrumental tracks from Slaughter, which I couldn't imagine At The Gates playing live.\n\nDespite the minor innovations going on with theme and musical style, these veteran musicians cannot make At War with Reality a powerful listen. In fact, I feel the album loses out twofold, firstly because much of the content ceased to be startling many years before its creation and secondly because the listen possesses none of the urgency that made this an initially startling formula. Lindberg, although bringing more to the table lyrically than before, can't really translate his incensed yells to these theoretical topics, while the rest of the band offer up obviously competent ideas but fall short on memorability and any vestige of wow factor. The attacking style mostly exhibited here requires the musicians to be absolutely clinical - not much problem there - and also to get stuck in your head very quickly. I've listened to this album enough to know that nothing remains after I take my earphones out, even if it seems decent while I'm actually listening. That Anders Bj\u00f6rler quit not just At The Gates but also playing metal more generally a couple of years later does not surprise me when reflecting on the compositions here, which he and his brother Jonas jointly wrote. Maybe playing together in At The Gates felt inspiring, but the writing sessions surely ran short on magic.\n\nThus, At War with Reality seems rather like a failure to me, not in the sense that it's redundant as a listen nor that it's essentially poor, more that in the context of At The Gates' career it didn't achieve very much. If you could imagine that this line-up had been a new band in 2014 and had shopped around labels trying to get signed, I reckon their biggest selling point would not have been overriding quality but instead their similarity to At The Gates. The concept could have provided pretty effective window dressing for a consistent and slightly more nuanced sound than the average Scandinavian melodic death album, though no one would have seen past the real reason for the existence of At War with Reality: a release for people who missed At The Gates.\n",
        "\n\u201cThe Red In The Sky Is Ours\u201d was more structured than \u201cGardens Of Grief\u201d, yet was still an experimental record in some respects. When we recorded it, we had been together for just a year. The production is weird and very weak, Kerrang! Magazine described it the best: \u201cThe guitars sound like wet cucumbers\u201d. In terms of songwriting, we began getting to know each other musically. This was despite the fact I felt some of Alf's ideas were over the top, and that it was very strange music. What you hear on the album is \u201cAlf Light\u201d. I can't really remember our specific thoughts, or strategies at that time. Sometimes, though, I think we tried too hard to impress people with too many riffs and weird songwriting.\n\n-Anders Bj\u00f6rler, 2007 (\u201cThe Flames of the End\u201d? - Guitarist Anders Bj\u00f6rler wishes to pen the final chapter in the glorious history of Swedish legends At the Gates).\n\nThe first couple of months of rehearsing was surrounded by a very creative atmosphere. We tried all new ideas with open minds. Everything was possible. Since Alf was older than us and had the most extreme and twisted ideas, we felt there was total creative freedom.\n\n-Tomas Linderg, 2010 (Under a Serpent Sun: The Story of At the Gates).\n\nI must admit that I\u2019ve struggled with the task of elaborating this review for quite some time. Not solely due to my lack of expertise in the field of writing about music, but also because of the complexity and eccentricities the album in question presents, as well as the mood that conveys and the feelings/impressions that manages to cause the listener. I\u2019ve stumbled upon reviews and comments that described it as \"a descent into madness and chaos\", referring to its desperate and gloomy ambience. This isn\u2019t the typical Swedish death metal effort, neither death metal in general, and dare I say metal as a whole, and it can be difficult to explain its features through mere text.\n\nDespite existing more technical and/or \u201cavant-garde\u201d extreme bands (e.g. Atheist, Cynic, Gorguts, The Chasm, Demilich or Ved Buens Ende), \u201cThe Red in the Sky is Ours\u201d still accomplishes to stand aside. What we have here is a unique piece that, nearly 30 years after its publishing, hasn\u2019t been emulated by other acts (thankfully!).\n\nNow, concerning Anders\u2019 words, I have to say he\u2019s right \u2013 but only partially so. I state this because the group indeed crafted a one-of-a-kind work, yet not in the way he claims, as if the rarities to be found here implied negative connotations, when in reality is just the opposite. Said oddities mark the difference. He evidently deserves recognition too, for he\u2019s credited as a composer in multiple tracks, but in all honesty, his expressions seem like an attempt to discredit the major responsible for this opus. \n\nAs asserted in the quotes, Svensson\u2019s influence predominates in the more ambitious songs, which includes a wide array of influences that not only come from death and black metal, but also Swedish folk music. His unique perspective delves into intense, progressive, experimental and non-linear structures, almost antithetical of the simple and straight-forward approach adopted after his departure. If you heard Grotesque's EP \"Incantation\", you know what you\u2019re in for: lots of phenomenal riffs and lead sections, although with fewer solos. The essence of the guitar work resides in the contrasting, polyphonic melodies, in addition to the recurrent tempo changes \u2013 surely a product of his unorthodox technique of reversing tapes and trying to mimic with his guitar what was being played. \n\nJonas Bj\u00f6rler\u2019s bass replicates most of what the guitars are playing with tight accuracy, but also shines through in certain brief moments (for example, in \u201cClaws of Laughter Dead\u201d, \u201cNeverwhere\u201d or \u201cCity of Screaming Statues\u201d).\n\nAdrian Erlandsson\u2019s drumming characterizes for being precise, efficient and sober. If I had to compare his style to another drummer\u2019s within the genre, that\u2019d be Ken Owen. Unlike others, they don\u2019t blast and throw fills mindlessly throughout the song for the sake of it \u2013 instead, they proceed to do it when it\u2019s needed in order to emphasize certain sections and/or to catch the listener off-guard. The album opener, as well as \u201cWithin\u201d or the aforementioned \u201cClaws of Laughter Dead\u201d, \u201cNeverwhere\u201d and \u201cCity of Screaming Statues\u201d are fine examples of his outstanding performance.\n\nTomas Lindberg is no slouch. Albeit I consider he improved significantly by the band\u2019s third and fourth endeavor, here he delivers high-pitched, heart-rending vocals that go hand-in-hand with the dark, nihilistic and introspective lyrics. Check the tortuous screams in the beginning of the first, second, fourth and seventh track, just to mention a few.\n\nThe review wouldn\u2019t be complete without mentioning Jesper Jarold\u2019s concise yet crucial contributions. The violin lines definitely incorporate distinction and variety, and its tendency to appear unforeseeably and sporadically reinforces its impact.\n\nThe only aspect one could, in the slightest, perceive as a weakness, actually benefits the record\u2019s lugubrious atmosphere. The production, which does in fact sound considerably weak and thin (take, for instance, the muddy guitar tone, the fragile drums and the overall discreet bass), implies a step-back from \u201cGardens of Grief\u201d. Nonetheless, it\u2019s one of the key factors in achieving such a peculiar sound, to the point I wouldn\u2019t imagine it with a different mix.\n\nIn fine, this is the absolute and premature pinnacle of At the Gates career and, as such, constitutes one of the greatest death metal releases of all time and a mandatory listening experience to anyone that deems themselves as a connoisseur of the genre. Several tries might be required, but it\u2019ll be well worth it. I suggest you to listen to it while laying on bed, with your eyes closed and the lights off.\n\nFavorite tracks: all of them are extraordinary, but my selection includes \u201cKingdom Gone\u201d, \u201cWithin\u201d, \u201cNeverwhere\u201d, \u201cThrough Gardens of Grief\u201d, \u201cWindows\u201d.\n",
        "\nI am a late comer to the At the Gates appreciation club, having paid attention to the Swedish icons only since their 2018 album To Drink from the Night Itself. Therefore, when their new record, The Nightmare of Being, was released earlier this year, I finally decided to purchase the CD to properly check it out. The reason why the last two records caught my attention is probably also the reason why some oldtime supporters are giving the band a hard time in specialized webzines and review sites: slowly but surely, the Swedes have started weaving conspicuous progressive rock/metal into their sound, noticeably bastardizing the melodic death metal style they once contributed to create.\n\nThe Nightmare of Being brings together three different strands of musical influences. The core of the music is still melodic death metal, built on a foundation of fast guitar riffs that are both razor-sharp and exquisitely melodic, pounding and hyper-tight drumrolls (Adrian Erlandsson puts in a massive performance behind the drumkit), and Tomas Lindberg\u2019s unhinged, high-pitched growls. While in a few songs At the Gates seem happy to not stray too far from the style that made them famous (most evidently in the initial three songs of the record), elsewhere they enrich the melodeath assault with hints of 1970s hard prog as well as dark wave and gothic rock, conjuring up a hybrid sonic world that it is hard not to find enthralling. \n\nThe prog rock influences hark back to the sound of the darkest end of the spectrum of 1970s bands, such as King Crimson and Van der Graaf Generator. This is conveyed through the use of the mellotron and other eerie keyboard sounds, as well as sombre real strings and woodwinds arrangements (\u201cTouched by the White Hands of Death\u201d, \u201cThe Fall into Time\u201d, \u201cThe Abstract Enthroned\u201d). Meanwhile, \u201cGarden of Cyrus\u201d introduces a jazzy saxophone lead, which again brings to mind King Crimson (and particularly their Red album). It should be said that At the Gates are not the only nor the first extreme metal band to look back at the dark progressive rock of the 1970s for inspiration. Ihsahn, Enslaved, and Opeth are three prominent examples of bands that have followed the same path several years ahead of the Swedes. Moreover, these bands have definitely pushed the prog rock influences much more prominently into their sound compared to At the Gates, which instead use the 1970s heritage only to add hints of a new dimension to their artform rather than as a way to completely revolutionize it, like Opeth have done for instance. It is nevertheless fascinating to hear violins, flutes and clarinets weaving in and out of aggressive death metal riffs, especially in tracks like \u201cThe Fall into Time\u201d where the band have truly challenged themselves to write music that stretches well beyond the classic melodeath canon. Elsewhere, At the Gates make a more vanilla use of the barrage of classical instrumentation they have at their disposal, essentially as an atmospheric prelude or interlude to their more conventional death metal style. Tracks like \u201cTouched by the White Hands of Death\u201d and \u201cThe Abstract Enthroned\u201d are slightly underwhelming in this respect, and they do not strike me as neither very original nor particularly accomplished. \n\nThe other element that emerges through the 10 tracks of The Nightmare of Being is an evident penchant for dark wave and gothic rock. This is most apparent on the oppressive yet groovy \u201cCosmic Pessimism\u201d, a track that builds on a bouncy clean guitar riff apparently inspired to krautrock and bands like Neu! and Tangerine Dream, for what is one of the standout moments of the whole album. Elsewhere, the gothic undertones surface through the use of clean guitar breaks and especially Tomas Lindberg\u2019s half-spoken vocal croon, a style he uses quite often on this record, reminding me at times of Dark Tranquillity\u2019s Mikael Stanne.\n\nWith all these disparate ingredients thrown into the mix, The Nightmare of Being makes for a varied and engaging listening experience. Not everything on the album is gold, and in fact there are more than a couple of episodes that feel a tad too run-of-the-mill and unremarkable (\u201cThe Paradox\u201d, the title-track, \u201cTouched by the White Hands of Death\u201d \u201cEternal Winter of Reason\u201d). However, when inspiration strikes them, At the Gates manage to give us some striking pieces of music, perfectly balanced between raw aggression and sophisticated melancholy. \u201cGarden of Cyrus\u201d, \u201cThe Fall into Time\u201d, \u201cCult of Salvation\u201d and \u201cCosmic Pessimism\u201d are all little gems of modern melodic death metal that cleverly push the boundaries of the genre without straying too far from its core essence. The Nightmare of Being is a bit too patchy to be heralded as a contemporary masterpiece, but it nevertheless shows that there is still creative blood running in the icy veins of the Swedish combo, and it will certainly be interesting to see where they will decide to bring this creativity next.\n",
        "\nAt The Gates are pretty well known in the metal scene, as they are one of three commonly cited bands (alongside Dark Tranquillity and In Flames) to have pioneered the melodic death metal sound in Gothenburg in the 90s.\n\nTheir older releases are the most celebrated, and it\u2019s easy to see why. ATG's more recent releases seem to lack some of the contagious energy present on the debut and Slaughter of the Soul. Their previous record, To Drink from the Night Itself, had a decent sound that was hurt greatly by its unusual production. You can tell on that record that vocalist Tomas Lindberg's vocals have changed over time, sounding much more strained and drier than they do on previous releases.\n\nOn The Nightmare of Being, the change, and arguably, deterioration of Lindberg's vocals is put on full display. Whereas the strange production on the previous album masked the vocals somewhat, this record's relatively clean production really shows them off. The strained, and dry vocals are impossible to miss. I'm not sure if he's trying something different with the vocals or if his voice has been damaged, but they often sound extremely grating, lacking the ferocious and aggressive qualities present before.\n\nOf course, vocals are not everything, and there is some good instrumentation on display here. The riffs and guitar melodies continue to be high quality, and I don't really have any gripes with them. Something new ATG did with this record is adding progressive metal into their sound; progressive elements can fit very well into melodeath, but they fit into this album extremely poorly. They decided to add saxophone to one of the songs, and I can't see any reason why. This song has a really long saxophone solo that doesn't connect to any of the music before or after it, and just feels very inserted rather than an actual part of the album. The progressive touches that continue through the latter half of the album are very cliche and do not explore anything beyond a basic idea of prog metal; the latter half of the record is also interspersed with several atmospheric sections that do not mesh well with ATG's general sound nor the songs they're found in and really don't flow with the music at all. There are also some spoken word type vocals that feel extremely out of place and once again make the album feel like a forced attempt at a progressive sound, with no substantial work to incorporate the progressive elements into the actual sound.\n\nThe first few songs are where the best content is, which is really bad for a full-length album. The latter half plods on through its progressive and atmospheric sections with no real direction, climax, or anything. If you can get past the vocals, the first few tracks are actually pretty good, but after that, there's really nothing interesting or exciting to be found in this record. While the attempt at a more progressive sound is bold and unexpected for a band like At the Gates, the attempt ultimately fails pretty massively and just creates a boring record without much real creativity or energy.\n",
        "\nA 5-piece still and I'd say a way overrated album I don't care what Decibel said about this. It has the roots in melodic death metal, but none of the riffs really struck me as awe-inspiring. They were pretty generic and a good portion of clean tone guitar-work. The vocals aren't that swift and I really think that they're not hacking it anymore. 'At War With Reality' wasn't that great either. I prefer 'Slaughter of the Soul' and they've had gaps in their remaining together or not. I think that they should just hang it up. There was nothing on here that took me aback as to saying \"wow, what a milestone.\" Nothing of that sort.\n\nI guess I just feel that they lack the intensity and originality of the old. Really, I though this was a mountain of poor musicianship. I'm not hearing tints of the old, I'm hearing generic of the new. They're not hacking it and I think that pretty much none of the riffs hold weight in my brain. The intensity is not there nor is the songwriting capabilities. I thought that maybe the vocals would've been good as well but they just lacked balls on the whole of this LP. I was hopeful when I bought this given that Decibel had a hold on this then looking at the scores that I madly disagreed with wholeheartedly. \n\nThe production was decent, but to a shadowing cloud of dismay and dismantling. The fire is gone, I'm not hearing it. It should be among the realm of melodic rock 'n roll. They seem to not be really metal at all, just gearing more of what Opeth did with their career. Not as bad here though but that's the direction that they seem to be. What a letdown. I wasn't overzealous when I played this in my car the whole way home. I had to put Deicide back on because ATG made me disturbed with their latest creation.. It is just piss-poor of a release and a disenchanting, disheartening platter of melodic crap.\n\nDraw your own conclusion to this release. Maybe listen on Spotify or YouTube and see if this is for you. If you're thinking ATG of the old, think again. It's really nothing of what the critics are saying such as \"best album of the year\" or thereabouts. I wish I could've said nice things about the release but the music was just pitiful. If you're asking why would I think that well it lacks intensity of the old and weaves in the generic of the new. Way way overrated album it's nothing like what's been described even to the ones who think that they're giving it a chance in the metal world. Caveat Emptor!\n",
        "\nI ought to start this review with a disclaimer: I got into At The Gates through their post-reunion output, more specifically To Drink From the Night Itself, which in turn prompted me to look into their past works. Sacrilege, I know. That being said, I did quite enjoy those albums, and their influence can\u2019t be understated. Slaughter of the Soul specifically proved to be a template for the hundreds of melodic metalcore bands that came to be in the 2000s. Since their reunion though, At The Gates has been trying to recapture that album's essence, to varying degrees of success. When The Nightmare of Being was announced, I was cautiously optimistic, since the leadup singles to it were actually able to pique my interest in the album. Turns out, the band had other plans in store. \n\nThis album is inconsistent to high hell. For every good and energetic track there was at least one that just left me scratching my head in confusion. I did read that the band experimented with some new things on the album, but I did not expect a damned saxophone to show up at \u201cGarden of Cyrus\u201d. It was one of the many moments that had me checking my music player to see if I was still listening to the same album. The band has obviously used non-metal instruments in the past, and they still do, but its inclusion here and nowhere else on the album makes it stick out like a sore thumb and gives the impression of \u201chey, this sounds neat, let\u2019s add it\u201d. There are plenty of orchestral additions sprinkled throughout the album which are far more successful, like choir vocals and the violin that any fan of The Red in the Sky is Ours will appreciate, no doubt.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that some songs end abruptly, as if the band just decided to stop playing with nary a crescendo to be found. Tracks like \u201cThe Paradox'' and \u201cGarden of Cyrus\u201d (yeah I\u2019ve a bone to pick with this one) just kind of stop, the latter in particular spending most of its runtime feeling like it's building up to something that never comes. It\u2019s just stuff like that that gives me the impression that the album needed some more time in the oven.\n\nThat being said, there are plenty of strong tracks here, full of catchy melodies that stand out and leave a good impression. \u201cSpectre of Extinction\u201d is an extremely strong opener, and the tremolo riff used throughout brings to mind melodic black metal, which was a pleasant surprise. There are also tracks that bring to mind the Slaughter... era, with rapid fire riffing that gives way to some great chugs like on \u201cTouched by the White Hands of Death\u201d and \u201cThe Abstract Enthroned\u201d, the latter of which has one of the best riffs on the album.\n\nThe production is also excellent, as expected of a band of At The Gates\u2019 caliber and with the backing of a label like Century Media. Everything sounds crisp and clean without being powerless, while the mixing also helps bring out the most out of every instrument, particularly the bass, which actually gets plenty of moments throughout the album.\n\nLyrically the band tackles social malaise, with themes of hopelessness and the futility of human existence permeating the entire album. All that is delivered by Tomas yet again, whose voice seems to have lost some of the power it used to have. His growl has always been one of the band\u2019s defining characteristics and to hear him sound as strained as he does here is saddening.\n\nThe Nightmare of Being shows us an old band trying its best to keep up. It feels like an attempt at expanding towards new horizons with a lot of experiments, not all of which are successful. It\u2019s an album that could be considered one that showcases growing pains in the future, if we ever end up getting one that expands on what\u2019s heard here. As it stands, it\u2019s probably their weakest effort so far, barring Terminal Spirit Disease. One can only hope this was merely a misstep and that we\u2019ll be treated to another quality album in the future.\n\nHighlights: Spectre of Extinction, Touched by the White Hands of Death, The Abstract Enthroned, Eternal Winter of Reason\n",
        "\nBy \"At War With Reality\" and \"To Drink From The Night Itself\" I recognized the return of At The Gates quite nice and generally consistent, but...not very engaging and a bit devoid of ingenuity - of course comparing it with the times before their reactivation. With the content of \"The Nightmare Of Being\"...such paradoxical conclusions do not come to mind! It only comes to mind that the Swedes from At The Gates finally decided to extend the previous formula with a large amount of meaningful novelties, and that they can positively surprise. As a result, on \"The Nightmare...\" an interesting mix was created between old patents and those refreshing their style. \n\nHowever, at the very beginning the Swedes suffered a monstrous suicide - or at least something that could effectively discourage them from listening to the whole cd. Well, the \"Spectre Of Extinction\" is like a cheap copy of (weaker) tracks from \"To Drink...\" and a thing...that has a really terrible chorus! There is nothing interesting or addictive in it (maybe apart from a fragment with a solo), but you can hear a rather mediocre attempt to jump into the worst sort of mainstream. Fortunately, the quintet later only get better. Where the band focused on their traditional side, for example in \"The Abstract Enthroned\", \"Touched By The White Hands Of Death\", \"Cult Of Salvation\" or \"The Paradox\", the Swedes proposed very good songs, well-balanced between melodiousness and heavy sound, and at the same time quite diverse in terms of climate (they cannot be confused with each other). \n\nThe best that \"The Nightmare Of Being\" has to do with...what is not too like At The Gates style! In many tracks, the band sometimes turns into areas of progressive metal, as if the Swedes had listened to some of Opeth's albums or Ihsahn's solo project and decided to come it to themselves. The effect was excellent, because a lot of combining and playing with \"clean\" guitars or with keyboard inserts (e.g. in the title track, \"The Fall Into Time\" or \"Cosmic Pessimism\") gave an even more varied character to the music of At The Gates and meaningfully refreshed it - a bit already aging - formula. But, but, the biggest highlight of \"The Nightmare Of Being\" is \"Garden Of Cyrus\" - a calm, progressive track with...saxophone solos! \n\nIn this way, the Swedes erased my rather indifferent impressions from the two previous albums. On \"The Nightmare Of Being\" they decided to really collect their older patents and extend them with new, slightly less obvious ones - keeping moderation in the latter. It came out naturally, meaningfully and with good proportions, which is the style I missed before.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/07/at-gates-nightmare-of-being-2021.html\n",
        "\nIt is evident from the first few seconds of acoustic guitar that this, not At War With Reality or To Drink from the Night Itself is At the Gates' long-awaited comeback album. \n\nThat's no knock to its predecessors - they were perfectly enjoyable, if somewhat less compelling, rehashes of the Slaughter of the Soul sound. But The Nightmare of Being? Man, this is something else. The driving, sorrowful Gothenburg sound does form the basis of the music, but the style has been pushed forward in a heretofore-unheard direction, rife with progressive flourishes and a sonic arc that carries through the entire album rather than just individual tracks. \n\nNaysayers, of course, will denounce all the palm-muting and pedal tones, and they're not entirely wrong; a lot of the riffs here do feel like stock At the Gates. The upshot is that it actually sounds like At the Gates, where the other post-reunion albums have sounded more At the Gates-influenced. This is particularly surprising given that it's the band's first album without Anders Bj\u00f6rler, whose vision had defined the band's sound for almost its entire lifespan. Yet the acoustic passages in particular reclaim the frigid melancholy of the band's 90s output in a way that their other recent albums simply haven't. \n\nNew guitarists do mean new sounds, though, and cuts like \"The Fall Into Time\" and \"Cosmic Pessimism\" deftly blend old and new sounds into something that feels both familiar and fresh. Nowhere is this more apparent than on \"Garden of Cyrus\", whose midtempo groove and jazz-inflected instrumental break entirely new ground for the band. It's very rare to hear saxophone implemented in an extreme metal context so beautifully (Enslaved's album E comes to mind) but here it doesn't even register as out of the ordinary. Strangely, though, this is one of the few tracks that actually suffers from Tomas Lindberg's contribution. The vocals don't even appear until the song nears its end, and spoken word dominates until the very end. That's hardly a problem on its own, but the song's instrumental is so compelling that I'd have much preferred to hear its themes developed rather than a simple rehash of the non-chorus with some lazy speech and screams sat atop it. \n\nThis underwhelming ending is not alone - several of the tracks end disappointingly, either because of ill-advised stylistic choices or because their final moments were simply underdeveloped. Tracks 2, 3 and 5 in particular leave a very bitter taste in my mouth. I'm mostly compelled by the songs - minus the bizarre orchestral introduction to \"Touched by the White Hands of Death\" - but all three end suddenly enough to be jarring. \n\nI mention that orchestral introduction deliberately, as the increased introduction of quasi-classical sounds has been perhaps my least favorite development in At the Gates' sound. Ironically, the strings are one of my favorite aspects of their legendary debut The Red in the Sky is Ours; since the band's reunion, though, I've felt that their ambition has too often outweighed their ability to assess the aptness of a part's placement within a song. Part of what made Slaughter of the Soul so memorable was the choice to relegate those classical influences to guitars; this grounded the style within a death metal context without sacrificing the harmonic language the band sought. Here, I'm often left wondering how much more focused the album could have sounded without the gratuitous usage of string orchestras. \n\nIt feels strange to spend so much time needling the album for its faults when, overall, I loved it. This, I suppose, is just further testament to its quality - I feel like I can spend more time focusing on weaknesses because the disc's strengths speak for themselves from the moment the album begins. To hear such a multifaceted, sincerely experimental album from a group of middle-aged men who've made straightforward melodeath their bread and butter for over 20 years is astonishing. Hell, the fact that I enjoy every single song from a new album by a band whose heyday was several years before my birth is wild. But The Nightmare of Being is nothing if not surprising - it's a powerful statement of intent from a band determined to prove that they are still very much in their prime. I, for one, am fully convinced.\n",
        "\nPhrases like meteoric rise and from out of nowhere tend to be thrown around a bit too often of late in reference to consequential moments in metal history, but in the case of Gothenburg death metal pioneers At The Gates, they prove a fitting description. Forming in the early days of Sweden\u2019s entry into the death metal craze, their initial run from 1990 until 1996 would prove short compared to their two fellow Gothenburg trailblazers In Flames and Dark Tranquillity, but also highly impactful as this period would produce four studio LPs that have significantly shaped the melodic death metal style, so much so that two rival camps have endured among the sub-genre\u2019s corresponding fan base regarding whether the more conservative death metal trappings of their first two albums or the forward-looking nature of the latter two are the superior works. \n\nYet since this outfit\u2019s 2010 reformation and subsequent output, it has been quite clear that At The Gates has been singularly focused upon expanding the scope of the sound explored on 1994\u2019s Terminal Spirit Disease and 1995\u2019s Slaughter Of The Soul, and their most recent effort The Nightmare Of Being is no exception. Drawing upon the bleak and cold intellectual musings of modern misanthropic philosophy, this is an album that similarly maintains the classic underpinnings of the original Gothenburg sound, in contrast to the modern groove and metalcore trappings of In Flames. Yet the path taken here is of a more organic character, avoiding the excessive atmospheric keyboard shtick of Dark Tranquillity for something more impact-based, yet shying away from the mostly kinetic thrashing character of Arch Enemy. In short, this is an album that is of a more nuanced character, often compartmentalizing its softer and harsher moments to build a sense of crescendo and release.\n\nBuilding off a similarly gloomy ambient introduction, this is a collection of songs that flows in storybook fashion, complete with the obligatory mixture of twists and turns before hitting the apex point. The opening anthem \u201cSpectre Of Extinction\u201d is of a fairly compact and straightforward character, beginning on a somber acoustic theme that is then transferred to a blaring distorted yet still melodic roar after the mold of Metallica\u2019s \u201cBattery\u201d, and similarly launching into high octane thrashing territory at about a third of the way in and riding the wave all the way to the permafrost steeped shores. Additional offerings that follow a comparable path of swift and aggressive fury include the riveting crusher \u201cThe Paradox\u201d and \u201cThe Abstract Enthroned\u201d, each merging sorrowful yet consonant melodic motives into a frenetic package reminiscent of vocalist Tomas Lindberg\u2019s brief stint in The Crown.\n\nNaturally as hinted earlier, this is not an album that lives by swift death thrashing madness alone, and along for the ride are some interesting interludes into atmospheric territory. The comparatively short title offering \u201cThe Nightmare Of Being\u201d takes on a gloomier, more Gothic-tinged approach, and otherwise primal shouter Lindberg eases off to a more haunting low tone spiel to further accentuate the song\u2019s melancholy ballad-like character. The generally mid-paced and groovy \u201cGarden Of Cyrus\u201d takes on a curiously jazzy twist with some tasteful saxophone interjection into a generally bleak and cold metallic crawl. The quasi-symphonic mini-epic \u201cThe Fall Into Time\u201d is arguably the most atypical offering of the bunch, having something of a Middle Eastern tinge to it at times and otherwise wandering through a semi-progressive array of contrasting sections, including an extended instrumental jam session where bassist Jonas Bjorler and drummer Adrian Erlandsson really step up and break the typical mold of a traditional melodeath arrangement.\n\nThose who took to the more melodically accessible and streamlined approach that became this band\u2019s staple during the mid-90s and upon their 2010 reunion will definitely find another worthy successor to the At The Gates legacy here. Despite decades of punishing his vocal chords on the road during subsequent efforts with such noted acts as Nigthrage, The Crown and Lock Up, front man Tomas Lindberg is still able to belt out those hair-raising barks with the best of them, while the corresponding instrumental performance by all involved is without any slouches. The right blend of smooth melodic transition with an occasional technical edge permeates every moment of this LP, and while both guitarist Martin Larsson and Jonas Stalhammar turn in solid performances, the guest guitar solo by King Diamond axe man Andy LaRocque on \u201cSpectre Of Extinction\u201d ends up stealing the show. This is a slight cut above 2018\u2019s To Drink From The Night Itself, and an overall solid entry by a band that still has much to say after more than 30 years of existence.\n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nPioneers of Gothenburg's melodic death metal scene along with In Flames and Dark Tranquility, At the Gates left an indelible mark on mid-nineties melodeath sound, especially through their fourth full-length release, Slaughter of the Soul, which would not only become a trademark of the genre, but also an influence for the newborn metalcore acts. While some may claim SotS to be the band's most one-dimensional work, its artistic relevance and historical impact are undeniable, making it a one-of-a-kind product of its time. This kind of legacy has a double-edged effect: if on the one hand it immortalizes the collective, on the other it becomes a heavy burden by which all their work is measured. Since their long-awaited studio comeback in 2014, At the Gates have constantly dealt with this comparison with the past, or more specifically, with their 1995\u2019s output. The dilemma between present and yesteryear can to some extent be observed in At War with Reality and To Drink from the Night Itself, which despite their differences remain anchored in the formula developed twenty years ago. This bond, while natural, is something the band intends to shake up in their newest release: The Nightmare of Being.\n\nInspired by philosophical pessimism, The Nightmare of Being orbits existential questions from a dark Lovecraftian perspective. A rather interesting concept, I would say, not only for its intellectual component but also for its negative narrative that fits like a glove to an album that meant to be somber since its inception. The Nightmare of Being is a creature born out of two main ideas, one being abstract and the other of an artistic nature, both aiming for a more progressive outcome. Songs such as 'Garden of Cyrus' or 'Cosmic Pessimism' are the ultimate embodiment of this audacious concept, venturing into uncharted territory. While the former delves into 70s progressive rock, the latter features an unexpected The Cure-ish gothic layer. The cinematic orchestration in 'Touched by the White Hands of Death' also incorporates this bolder approach while adding greater ambiance and grandeur to the music. The band's intent to spread its wings is palpable; there is a sense of purpose behind each song as if they blossom from a root firmly planted in a predefined concept. The narrated segments present in the first two previously mentioned songs and 'Cult of Salvation' are another strand that lends more credibility and intellectual depth to the album, thus further shuddering At the Gates' established canons.\n\nNow, the question that matters is whether At the Gates' boldness, despite its welcomed creative audacity, is enough to catapult them into a higher artistic dimension. It is up to each of us to assess the outcome since the answer will always depend on the variables we include in our equation. As far as I am concerned, I believe the band has enriched its portfolio without necessarily bringing anything new to the genre. In this sense, The Nightmare of Being guarantees more three-dimensionality within the band's creative boundaries, which in other words means that a step forward isn't necessarily synonymous with artistic relevance. It's like replacing your old black t-shirt with a colored one, but of the same model and material. If that makes any sense.\n\nDespite all the above, hardcore fans can rest assured as The Nightmare of Being still delivers some bangers like 'Spectre of Extinction', 'The Paradox' or 'The Abstract Enthroned' that ensure a bridge with the band's more straightforward side. The former even includes an interesting solo by the one and only Andy LaRocque, who is also the man in charge of recording the guitars and bass. Therefore, there's a willingness not to let this new venture stray out of orbit, keeping an open channel with the band's foundations. This balance reaches its peak in the closing track, 'Eternal Winter of Reason', which somehow merges the best of both worlds, thus mirroring the album's most inspired moment.\n\nPessimistically adventurous, yet predictably familiar, The Nightmare of Being explores new territory without ever straying too far from the band's DNA. In doing so, At the Gates ensures a creative paradox that lends a sense of identity and continuity to this bold new venture, while adding greater three-dimensionality to their songwriting formula. It's a step forward, I would say; an aesthetic breakthrough that unveils not only new grounds but also a willingness to evolve. And even though The Nightmare of Being doesn't gather all the necessary ingredients to establish itself as a masterpiece of the genre, it is most certainly a worthy and surprisingly contrasting addition to the band's discography.\n\nOriginally written for www.sputnikmusic.com\n",
        "\nWhile going through melodic death metal essentials, which is a genre I'm alien to, I came across this album. Seeing its rating on this site, I built some extremely high expectations for it. Seemingly, a powerful, emotional record, released as death metal was approaching its commercial peak, and was culturally at its zenith. From the band that released \"Slaughter of the Soul.\"\n\nSome four minutes later, as the violin mesmerizingly played away its notes in \"The Season to Come,\" I was at the peak of my disappointment. But surely, the rest of the album couldn't be like this, right? Right? No, this first track was just some bunch of random \"melodies\" tremolo'ed away, accompanied with a cliche, shit drum beats and blasts, with a horrible mix and an extremely weak and sterile guitar tone. Kingdom Gone is going to be better, right? RIGHT?!\n\nFive more minutes elapsed. And so was that, Kingdom fucking Gone. It was nothing different. After this, I came to the conclusion that this wasn't going to be any better. And I stopped paying attention afterwards. Just let it flow as the opening track's permutations vehemently attacked my ears.\n\nAs I said, this album was released during the cultural peak of death metal, and was very crucial to the development of what we know today as melodic death. While I'm a fresh fan of the genre myself, I can say that this seed of it that was yet to grow into a full plant is unfortunately nothing more than subpar death metal, with some technical gimmicks and progressive song structure elements. However, I'm very glad they took this sound and made it a million times more meaningful, and overall better, with their second album \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness.\"\n\nInstrumentally, it's \"eh.\" My description of the opening track describes the riffing and the drumming well enough. While everything is played competently, the writing is a disaster. The formula they had for this album really did have great potential, but they just didn't do a good job in the writing of the supposed melodies. It sounds more like a compilation of dissonant, random guitar playing accompanied with drums blasting to hell, rather than some actual meaningful, powerful music. The violin and the vocals are the real highlight here. The vocals are good, and get better with the following albums, not much to say about those. But the violin. Instruments other than the classic guitar-drum-bass trio are very rare in metal, and violin was something never seen in metal before at the time this album was released. The revolutionary usage of the violin here makes everything better. I just wish it was more prevalent.\n\nI often talk about the otherwise notable songs of the album after going over the instruments, but there's not much to talk about here. If anything, it's quite repetitive, a problem much more prevalent in the group's later albums. The opening track is weak, the violin solo that follows is a breath of fresh air, then everything that comes after is the same. The prevalence of the violin in \"Through Gardens of Grief\" and \"Windows,\" and the overall musicality of those songs makes them stand out though. After those tracks though, it's, as I said, more of the same. It ends unimpressively with \"Night Comes, Blood Black.\"\n\nOverall, just skip to \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness.\" This album isn't worth your time.\n\nHighlights: Through Gardens of Grief & Windows.\n",
        "\nI have the impression that the musicians of At The Gates after reactivation (too) liked \"Slaughter Of The Soul\". First, the band served the return of \"At War With Reality\" in these climates, 4 years later, the discussed \"To Drink From The Night Itself\". And there would be nothing wrong with that, because this is the style of this band, except that all the elements that previously did the job are somehow...ordinary here. Here it's necessary to come back to what I mentioned while reviewing \"At War...\", namely not to develop much and being too sentimental. Previously, the quintet had it downhill, it was enough to record something in the old style for them and everyone was happy, for \"To Drink...\", in turn, it's not so beautiful, the material can irritate with its redundancy. \n\nWell, the whole \"To Drink...\" imitatingly repeats well-known patents, the band offers a similar feeling of playing, well-known melodies, characteristic Tomas vocals, guitar sound, even the arrangement of songs and shortcomings. The production is different here, or a detail such as the proportion between melodies and faster play, but in fact these are just trifles that do not do a drastically different perception of the disc compared to its predecessor. Well, it can be sculpted in a well-known style in a rather interesting way, but with At The Gates A.D. 2018 lacks interesting ideas for developing well-known themes. \n\nThe problem is even bigger that the songs themselves are not weak. The biggest problem with this album is the surprisingly large amount of flimsy patents mixed in with the awesome ones. And so there are cool \"A Stare Bound In Stone\", \"In Death They Shall Burn\", title track, and the slower ones like \"In Nameless Sleep\" or \"The Colors Of The Beast\", but on the other hand, promising \"The Chasm\", \"A Labyrinth Of Tombs\", \"Palace Of Lepers\" fell into boring patterns or had average melodies. You can clearly hear the professional level of workmanship and a lot of effort in terms of material differentiation, but something like life and passion in this playing is missing. \n\nThe conclusions are therefore simple. It seems to me that after a band with such experience, you should require more than the well-known things. Despite the fact that \"To Drink From The Night Itself\" does not sound bad, well!, it is quite nice to listen to, but it does not captivate like \"At War With Reality\", not to mention the classics. I am glad that the album was written shortly and it was not delayed, like for example Carcass records, but \"To Drink...\" seems to me to be a worse version of \"At War...\". A pretty decent one, but mostly disappointing.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2019/09/at-gates-to-drink-from-night-itself-2018.html\n",
        "\nOnly 19 years after the release of \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" the reactivation of At The Gates was confirmed with the album. This should already be a big encouragement to check \"At War With Reality\", after all, the band did not want to record new music at first! In the case of this group, however, it was a good move, because the Swedes had a lot of time to refine the songs and carve them on the basis of more specific patents (and not, as in In Flames, based on newly-fashionable experiments). \n\nOf course, there is no question of a great revelation or any breakthrough here, but it's difficult for me to call \"At War With Reality\" something totally unnecessary. The music contained on this disc is At The Gates in an edition directly aimed at fans of the long's, the whole thing is not surprising, and at the same time does not sound like a random cluster of their most famous patents. \n\nIn terms of composition, it's different here, sometimes it lacks the old flair, other times it is ravishingly like the old times. First, the old-school \"Death And The Labyrinth\" stands out with a bizarre intro, then a very typical for them title track and the best on the tracklist \"The Book Of Sand (The Abomination)\". The calmer \"Order From Chaos\", the faster and more melodic \"The Circular Ruins\", the (again) slower \"The Night Eternal\" or the most reminiscent of the fourth longplay of the group \"The Conspiracy Of The Blind\" also perform well in this combination. The musicians themselves also maintained the form from before the reactivation, although you can attach a bit to the vocals of Tomas Lindberg, because you can hear that the peasant's years are behind him, they are not fatal or unacceptable - they just fare weaker compared to those from \"Slaughter Of The Soul\". The most important changes to \"At War...\", however, are limited to production. In general, they dealt with it quite well here, it has not been changed in any direction, everything sounds clear, and at the same time it does not bring to mind modern, overloaded productions. \n\nThe review may suggest that the album is average at best. It is not so. I am glad that the return of At The Gates was reflected on the album, the music turned out to be quite good for them, it does not only use proven patents and - above all - can stay for longer. Obviously, this is not the same level as it used to be, but looking at all kinds of returns of some top players, the Swedes were surprisingly positive on this.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2019/09/at-gates-at-war-with-reality-2014.html\n",
        "\nThe most famous production in the output of At The Gates is a thing directly aimed at fans of Gothenburg sounds, according to the opinions that can be found on the Internet (and not only), it's one of their best albums that the quintet managed to create, extremely influential in this trend, etc. etc...Okay, I'll be honest, at the beginning it was so on my way with \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" it was not as it seems after the evaluation that was at the bottom, but with time I liked this album a lot (though not as much as \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\"). So many memories from \"once there\", now general info about music. \n\nCompared to \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness\" or \"Terminal Spirit Disease\", the music on \"Slaughter...\" has become a bit lighter, has a slightly different feeling, a much better sound (you will catch every detail) and it seems to be more consistent. There are also many more melodies and simpler music here than on previous releases, although...it does not disturb the high level of the music in any way. The whole thing offers a piece of excellent melo-death, which is neither boring nor overwhelming with melodies, it's made with common sense - and in such playing it is a real rarity. \n\nThe vast majority of works here revolve around the patents already known to them, but they develop the ideas from their predecessors in a more interesting way. Songs such as \"World Of Lies\", \"Legion\", \"Blinded By Fear\", the title track, \"Nausea\" or \"Cold\" can suit even those who do not listen to this music; the songs are simple, easily digestible, fairly quick (this time without blasts), with a bang and are instantly memorable. A lot of work (if not the biggest) is also done by the aforementioned production. It can be assumed that with a different sound, the disc would not kick as hard. In any case, the band managed to achieve a fairly sterile and pampered production, and a much more convincing release than some other melo-death bands later on. \n\nBut I don't quite like \"Slaughter...\" any softer or acoustic fragments. There are not too many of them and it does not take the edge off the music, but...even in such tiny doses it's difficult not to get the impression that it spoils more than makes sense (check for example \"Unto Others\"). To make matters \"worse\", we still have two not bringing anything clogging (\"The Flames Of The End\", \"Into The Dead Sky\"), although these can of course be clicked through without regret - both have a marginal influence on the rest of the album. To sum up, the general impressions of the \"Slaughter...\" are really good, the music is awesome and even any inaccuracies do not affect its reception weaker. After all, it was said to be one of the best At The Gates.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2019/08/at-gates-slaughter-of-soul-1995.html\n",
        "\nIt's very difficult for me to clearly rate \"Terminal Spirit Disease\". On the one hand, there are only 6 tracks + 3 live recordings, which is definitely too short, on the other hand, material that paradoxically does not differ much from \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness\" (except for the cover). Unfortunately, \"Terminal Spirit Disease\" loses a lot of the fact that it is not an ep, one gets the impression that it was made in a hurry, calculated under a contract binding the band (which was true...) and based solely on known patents. Totally contradicting the syndrome of the third album. \n\nBut even despite the shit-formula invented by the media, a little over 20 minutes of premiere music is terribly small, especially for a band that previously had two solid \"awesome\" albums up its sleeve. At The Gates offered here a continuation of the patents known from the aforementioned \"With Fear...\" and basically not much else. Interestingly, occasionally the violin in the style of \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\" appears here, although this is also nothing new, only a small reference to the debut. \n\nTherefore, the album includes only standard songs for this style, including \"Forever Blind\", \"The Fevered Circle\", \"The Swarm\", \"The Beautiful Wound\" and the title track. Fortunately, these songs have nothing to do with the trashy In Flames or other equally cheerful musicians, they are made with power and without embarrassing ideas, where there must be some sweet melody all the time. In each of them we have a lot of delicious riffs, fast tempos, nice melodies and a lot of Lindberg's screams - that is generally At The Gates in a nutshell. Although the material is expanded with an acoustic instrumental (\"And The World Returned\"), it's a song to skip, not too thrilling and rather filling here.\n\nLater on, the band included live tracks, \"Kingdom Gone\" from their debut, \"All Life Ends\" from the demo \"Gardens Of Grief\" and \"The Burning Darkness\" from \"With Fear...\". It may be a good choice, but in their place I would rather hear the premiere material than the already known one. As I mentioned in the introduction, the most difficult thing is to unequivocally assess the content of \"Terminal Spirit Disease\". The new songs are surprising on average, and the old ones served alive seem to be completely redundant here. I know that there will be some supporters of this album, but purely objectively (sic!), At The Gates both earlier and later managed to produce much better music. The discussed one can only be listened out of curiosity.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2019/08/at-gates-terminal-spirit-disease-1994.html\n",
        "\nI still remember exactly when, on a dark November day in 1995, a buddy brought me my ordered \"Slaughter of the Soul\" CD and I listened to it for the first time. The intro alone with the spoken words and the following inferno \"Blinded by Fear\" completely blew me away back then and even today this album casts its spell over me and has lost nothing of its effect.Compared to the first two albums, \"Slaughter of the Soul\" is an unbelievable increase (although those two weren't bad either) and more than just a logical continuation of \"Terminal Spirit Disease\" (just listen to the solo on \"Under the Serpent Sun\"). \n\nThe incredibly varied and catchy melodies, which are accompanied by the wonderfully venomous vocals of Tompa, are unsurpassed in my opinion. The compositions always seem completely thought out and are great structured, everything seems like from one cast. Despite the consistently high tempo, the songs remain comprehensible and accessible to the listener at all times. Each song on the album is unique, although the last two (\"Nausea\" and \"Need\") lose some quality. The rage with which Tompa screams the songs out of his soul is so palpable that you would like to roar along. Maybe to slaughter your soul.\n\nParticularly cool songs in my eyes are \"Under the Sperpent Sun\" because of its incredibly accessible song structures, which, as already said, is underlined with felted out melodies, also the chorus is a \"roar along\" and the spoken words with the re-entering voice of Tompa is great composed; \"Suidice Nation\" started with an awesome scream and again very accessible melodies, partly the song is composed in minor, if I'm completely wrong, which creates an additional drama of the piece. \"Blinded by Fear\" of course can't be ignored, alone the force with which the track rolls over you and pulls you under its spell is remarkable. Oh, and \"Unto Others\" has such wonderful melodic passages that still give me goosebumps even after 25 years, simply an indescribably brilliant song.\n\n\"Slaughter of the Soul\" is next to the first two In Flames albums (\"Lunar Strain\" and \"Subterranean\") and \"The Gallery\" by Dark Tranquillity the melodic death album that I would blindly recommend to everyone. After that, in my eyes, there was nothing that even came close to the class. However, there are a few points deducted for the two already mentioned pieces, which then fall a bit behind. \n\nUnfortunately, At The Gates have disbanded on their zenith, as is well known, I often wonder what else could have come, if this had not happened. The previous albums that came after the reunion, however, do not convince me nearly as much as their first four longplayers. Too bad.\n",
        "\nOn their second release, the Swedes from At The Gates fucked up, lost their originality and went into a melodic shit...with this opinion I have heard once. None of these things, because although the band actually changed and decided to go into pure melodic death metal, they did not record a bad music on \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness\" - and this is said by a person who also appreciates their debut the most. Besides, At The Gates is one of the pioneers of this style. \n\nA year after the release of \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\", the quintet from At The Gates decided to record much simpler, more transparent material without any major additions (eg. the violin disappeared). Therefore, many more melodies appeared in the music, but also fragments that were not too complicated/easier to digest. And despite the fact that the previous styling offered more and was more unique, the \"new version\" of At The Gates also fared similarly well. The music has a different feeling here compared to \"The Red...\"; it's more catchy and without any clear combinations. Even where the band speeds up over 4 minutes (\"Primal Breath\", \"The Break Of Autumn\", \"Ever-Opening Flower\", \"Blood Of The Sunsets\", \"Non-Divine\" - generally quite often), the band serve a lot of melodies, without any sweetening, a la In Flames. The latter alone should be a sufficient guarantee of the excellence of this material. \n\nOf the most specific songs that fit into the new At The Gates style, it's worth mentioning the opening longplay \"Beyond Good And Evil\", followed by \"Raped By The Light Of Christ\" and the closing song \"Through The Red\", surprisingly direct and without melody death clich\u00e9. \"Stardrowned\" also looks interesting, strongly \"chopped\" and in the style of the first album, nicely diversifying the simpler playing. The longer songs should also be mentioned, among others \"Primal Breath\" and \"Non-Divine\", just as good and quite concrete despite their length, and at the same more extensive. However, I am not entirely convinced in this set by the hidden cover of Discharge (\"The Nightmare Continues\"), which - apart from the instruments - does not offer anything interesting (unless someone likes noise vocals). It exists as if in isolation from the rest of the songs. \n\nWell, as you can see, it is better than good, the album is listened to with interest and it does not reject the flood of melo-death patents that have replaced the more extreme ones. Although \"The Red...\" is a year older than the discussed \"With Fear...\", the latter can also be kept for a long time, despite some simplifications.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2019/08/at-gates-with-fear-i-kiss-burning.html\n",
        "\nIt just so happens that of all At The Gates albums, I like to return to the debut album \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\" most often. I am aware that on the next albums the Swedes gained more popularity and \"influence\" (especially due to \"Slaughter Of The Soul\"), but what can I do? That's my taste in music. The effect turned out to be really amazing.\n\nOn \"The Red...\" we get a very unusual and unconventional death metal, different from what bands like In Flames or Dark Tranquility played on their first albums! At The Gates just stood out perfectly; on the one hand, they served music clearly stronger than the \"competition\" from the local scene, on the other hand, they could come into an atmospheric violin playing or serve some more progressive/technical patterns close to...Atheist! In the music itself - fortunately - you don't feel as much stylistic as my description might suggest.\n\nYou can find here a lot of classically good death metal (\"Kingdom Gone\", \"Through Gardens Of Grief\", \"City Of Screaming Statues\", the title song, \"Claws Of Laughter Dead\"), in similar amounts slower patterns (also the tracks above I mentioned), but also with progressive inserts (eg. in \"Neverwhere\", \"Night Comes, Blood Black\"). I mentioned the violin, and yes, it plays quite an important role on the album (guest recording by Jesper Jarold). In such songs as \"Within\", \"Windows\" or \"Neverwhere\" you can perfectly hear how At The Gates was able to operate them efficiently in their playing (the only weaker moment here is \"The Season To Come\" - but you can still get over it), almost like another guitar (there are even solos).\n\nYou do not have to look far for other advantages. Tomas' vocal (probably the most \"possessed\" that appeared on At The Gates albums), great guitar riffs, expressive basses or interesting drumming by Adrian Erlandsson are noteworthy here. So I think that \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\" should also appeal to those who do not deal with At The Gates or generally Swedish melo death. On their debut, however, it is \"something\".\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2019/08/at-gates-red-in-sky-is-ours-1992.html\n",
        "\nI rarely check EPs, let alone demos - it's a very special moment! However, in the case of At The Gates it would be a big mistake to omit their \"Gardens Of Grief\" (which, surprisingly, I also dealyed a bit), especially since - like later on \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\" - the Swedes surprised here with something less common on the Gothenburg scene. The At The Gates demo is also something a little different even in the context of an \"exceptional\" debut. \n\nThe quintet at that time was still dosing on the melodies, technical twists (although something like this appeared in \"All Life Ends\") and playing with the violin (instead, occasionally with keyboards); the band put the emphasis on simpler, more primitive and darker death metal. However, this doesen't mean that \"Gardens...\" is not original. On the contrary, the At The Gates demo is - almost the same as \"The Red...\" - something absolutely unique. The only two things that are losing out on this record is that it doesen't reach that much into progressive stuff like \"The Red...\" and...there are not too many of these songs (three or four more and there would be an LP!). \n\nApart from these trifles, \"Gardens...\" is a piece of quite ambitious, death metal music, which quickly catches quite specific and unlike other bands feeling. This can be heard after the opening \"Souls Of The Evil Departed\", but in fact...after each of the four tracks contained here. \n\nThe first one is distinguished by its fast pace, the next \"At The Gates\" and \"All Life Ends\" by overwhelming climate and considerable diversity, and \"City Of Screaming Statues\" by the greatest melody (not without reason, it was the only one that appeared later on the debut). The production also deepens the good impression, so in general the whole is relatively easy and pleasant to listen to. Well, since the subsequent, proper debut of At The Gates can unsatisified you (that they changed their style so quickly, of course! - there is no question of quality), \"Gardens Of Grief\" works quite well as a foretaste to this album. Maybe a bit short and slighty different stylistically, but still.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2020/06/at-gates-gardens-of-grief-1991.html\n",
        "\nFrom the moment the guitars come crashing in on \"Blinded By Fear\", At the Gates are on a mission to make two worlds collide. The darkness and aggression of underground death and thrash metal (unrelenting fury and speed)..... and the structure of standard rock/punk music (short, melodic songs built around hooks).\n\nAstonishingly, the Swedes managed to mold these constituent elements together so well that it sounded like something completely new itself. As with most innovators, they inspired many imitators who tried to emulate the formula (looking at you, American metalcore scene) with this album. But, to this day, I'm not sure I've heard another work that is as catchy - yet also as thunderously heavy and seething with anger - as Slaughter of the Soul.\n\nIt's amazing to hear the contrast. All of the songs are only 2 or 3-something minutes in length, and they just keep hitting - one after the other - of precise, catchy as hell, yet sinister, riffs, leads and delightfully memorable scream-along vocal refrains. Are you even a metalhead if you haven't screamed \"THE FACE OF ALL YOUR FEEEAAARS!\" or \"SICK AND NUMB, BY FEAR I FALL!\" or \"I FEEL MY SOUL GO COOOLD!\"??? In this way, it feels like a pop album because the songs are all so short, refined and catchy. But it's laid on top of a foundation of Anders Bj\u00f6rler's guitar melodies, often tinged with haunting notes of sorrow and despair, which create a spine-chilling contrast with Tomas Lindberg's vocals, which are pure fire-spitting fury. There's no room for other emotions than these. It's pure adrenaline, rocket-fuel for catharsis via mosh pit.\n\nThus, I suppose Slaughter of the Soul can be seen as Melodic Death Metal's Reign in Blood. It is an album with a singular mentality and compact songs that are criticized as \"repetitive\" or \"filler\" by people who just aren't as impacted by the visceral feeling unique to the album. Personally, I love both.\n\nI also love At the Gates' earlier work, particularly The Red in the Sky Is Ours, which is very different with its more unpolished, artsy and avant-garde approach to Death Metal, but you almost have to view this At the Gates as a completely different band from that At the Gates. Don't ignore this album because of any elitists who tell you that it's a sold-out or dumbed-down version of At the Gates. The band never sounded tighter or more aggressive than they do here, and simplifying their already-stellar songwriting down to only the most impactful components made for a historic and memorable album that will never be replicated.\n\nFavorite songs: Blinded By Fear, Slaughter of the Soul, Cold, Under a Serpent Sun, Unto Others\n",
        "\nWhen discussing The Red in the Sky is Ours, I feel that the majority of people either completely love or hate it; either describing it as a Swedish death metal classic that is one of a kind or a disorganized and pretentious effort. I\u2019m tempted to go with the latter here, but only partially so - At The Gates were certainly creative at this point in their career, but their debut certainly doesn\u2019t rank up there with the Swedish death metal classics (Left Hand Path being the crown jewel of them all as far as I'm concerned). \n\nObviously, the real brilliance of The Red in the Sky is Ours has to do with Alf Svensson. His guitar playing is very flexible; allowing high-flying riffs to appear by surprise (sometimes harmonized, but this is seldom happening), yet unlike Liers in Wait compositions are still highly memorable and surprisingly emotionally intense despite their unorthodox nature. The fastest sections feeling claustrophobic; quickly notable on the title track with its second riff being a played back variant of the opening and once the emphasis lies on a repeated riff pattern, a strange aura of melancholy evokes - presented by weepy tremolo attack of \u2018\u2019Windows\u2019\u2019 or the final stage of \u2018\u2019Within\u2019\u2019, where a violin passage joins for dramatic effects. Indeed, The Red in the Sky is Ours has deals more with psychological suspense than brute force and if that wasn\u2019t enough yet, Tomas Lindberg\u2019s vocals are contributive in the best way possible; dramatic shrieks howl through these labyrinthine compositions that resemble a man who has been taken prisoner and will be until the end of times. Certainly, this album is undeniably ambitious and twisted it could drain one mentally thanks to the emotional baggage it carries along.\n\nBut does The Red in the Sky is Ours ever become too ambitious for its own good? To a certain degree it does. Allowing the violins to completely take over on the second half of the title track while the guitars vanish into oblivion certainly isn\u2019t an advantage and \u2018\u2019Night Comes, Blood Back\u2019\u2019 just misses the mark as it moves too rapidly from one segment to another, preventing anything to really stick. Then there are the violins, which truth to be told, I\u2019m not even that fond of either. Often they hover around briefly; on the faster bits rather chaotic and pointlessly, while on the slower passages slightly more efficiently. The aforementioned ending of \u2018\u2019Within\u2019\u2019 is a great example as it allows the violins to match the slower, dramatic waves of riffs without a rush.\n\nEven if The Red in the Sky is Ours features a so-so opener and ends on a weak note, the numbers that appear in between are all pretty enjoyable \u2013 \u2018\u2019Within\u2019\u2019 being my absolutely favorite. Given its length, it expresses itself slightly more as an epic number than anything else; firstly opening up with a sinister crawling passage that recalls a black widow preparing her web to trap its prey before the voyage into madness begins. Indeed, what follows after is an emotional roller-coaster of dour riffing, tormented cries so powerful you can\u2019t get around them anymore and an acrobatic drum performance; all complementing each other in the best way possible during the countless amount of tempo changes. \n\nI\u2019d have liked to see At The Gates improve themselves as time went on, but sadly that was not to be. With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness would be the last album to feature Alf Svensson but already lacked in certain areas and the later records of this band are just something very different. While The Red in the Sky is Ours is no classic in my book, it is nonetheless an interesting piece of work that\u2019s very much worth checking out. Just beware...this is not for the faint hearted.\n",
        "\nWhen this album came out, it was a welcome and refreshing thing. But only compared to their earlier releases and the pathetic state death metal in general was in around 1995. I had 'The Red in the Sky Is Ours' and 'with Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness' on tape because during the first half of the nineties I collected all death metal I could get my hands on. But At The Gates - to be quite honest - was troubled by messy unbalanced songwriting and possibly the worst death metal vocalist one could imagine. 'Kingdom Gone' was one of the worst death metal songs in 1992 with ditto dumb video on MTV. If there ever was one guy who could scream in the most monotone possible way without any nuance, it has to be Tomas Lindberg.\n\nSo yeah, At The Gates were a very, very mediocre band at the most distant rear end of death metal. 'Terminal Spirit Disease' was at least a slight step up but not on all its songs. And then it was 1995. At The Gates decided to oversimplify their style (a wise decision to be honest) and release a short album filled with a few songs, all high paced (mostly) and oversaturated with a load of interchangeable 6/8 measure riffs. Honestly, Reign In Blood & Speak English Or Die are immensely varied albums compared to this. This was surely a cut-and-paste Ikea album. Just put on your umpta umpta drums and insert any random 6/8 riff from the bag.\n\nThe reason I liked this album (well, claimed to) back in 1995 was actually opener 'Blinded by Fear'. It worked and for once I could somewhat stomach the vocals. But in all honesty, I mostly ONLY played 'Blinded by Fear' over the years until I also got bored with that one. Listening back to the album now, as a whole, it is just boring. And that is because of two things:\n1- Those 6/8 riffs all the time. It gets so bloody tedious.\n2- The vocals. Yup, he still sucks. Metalcore screams all the time. The music already couldn't breath because of the lack of variation but the constantly screaming Lindberg dude makes it even impossible.\n\nSure, we have the laid back intermezzo 'Into the Dead Sky' or the \"Entombed Called And Want Their Wolverine Blues Riffs Back\" intro to 'Suicide Nation'. 'World of Lies' starts promising with the Hell Awaits drums but the fun - seriously - only lasts for 32 seconds! Because then again it's umptadrums with 6/8 riff fest again. And that on earth is that Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!  chorus (\"For we are enslaved, forever enslaved\") in the song 'Need'? Seriously?\n\nWhy did I bother to listen to the album again? Well, I went to see them live. To see/hear which songs I'd like to see live. Pfff. No, just no. I am giving away my original copy because I don't want to own this crap anymore. Still, one song I liked 25 years ago, so 10 points for that one.\n",
        "\nDeath metal isn't often thought of as a particularly melody driven form of music compared to say, black metal and even with the emergence of \"melodic death metal\" that didn't change very much. After all, its most famous progenitors were typically American bands who had savagery and sometimes even dissonance in shades but even the relatively less influential Swedish bands, melody was mostly something used to smooth out the edges here and there or occasionally add colour to dense punky bludgeoning. However that would rapidly change in the early 90's as bands as varied as Dark Tranquillity, Phantasm, Atheist, Darkthrone, Carbonized, Timeghoul, Traumatic Voyage, Afflicted, Funcunt, Septic Flesh and others saw fertile new grounds in a genre that had *just* solidified its foundations but hadn't fully codified its norms. Not too long ago, a certain Grotesque had also come to an end and from two of its former members plus a few new musicians would emerge At The Gates.\n\nPicking up where they left off a year ago with Gardens of Grief (which itself continued what was heard on Grotesque's Incantation in 1990... or well, the first three songs on that EP), At The Gates decided to vary up their approach to structure considerably and moved away from more straightforwardly narrative stacking of riffs-after-riffs into a more chaotic and conflicted approach that mirrored to an extent the American death metal of their time. Yet just like on that EP a wide range of harmony, melody, and tonal colour still defined these multifaceted compositions albeit now in far more unusually asymmetrical structures that were considerably harder to follow. The musician improved further to follow this new and highly demanding sound, bearing some parallels to works such as Afterlife's Surreality and Eternal Dirge's Morbus Ascendit in its combination of melody and technicality but with a comparatively far wider tonal palette and less emphasis on raw tenacity or the performance of each musician. In doing so it emphasizes a heavy degree of contrapuntal arrangement broken up by a maze-like structural dialogue of repeated themes clashing in new and and harsh ways, breaking forth at key junctions to allow for new themes to emerge and blossom and in doing so, fill in different chapters of an overarching story connected through individual riffs functioning like conflicting and uniting characters that gradually make sense of how both its melodic and tonal ideas work as a whole.\n\nAlthough the pacing isn't as fast or as frenzied as say, Liers in Wait (which featured three member of At The Gates), the songs can feel nearly as jam packed not necessarily due to having a similar number of riffs (seriously Spiritually Uncontrolled Art has enough riffs to fill up four albums at the least) as much as the constant changing of tempos, riffs, and tonalities present. It seems almost at odds with the moments of sublime beauty in these lengthier exchanges between both songs and the desolate, pained cries of the vocals. In spite of that there's a kind of order that emerges from this self-consuming, fragmenting chaos that's a distinct part of early 90's death metal where what feels like an armed conflict between all these constituent elements makes every riff feel a little more valuable as it is violently overtaken by another only to reappear later, its message and effect changed by new positioning and subsequently, a different part of the structural puzzle revealed and explained. While it is increasingly seen moreso nowadays as an earlier example of melodic death metal (and rightfully so), the band are not afraid to experiment with much less consonant moments almost like some sort of modernist classical inspired nightmare, wedding pure horror and paranoia to melancholy and almost yearning desire. This is a very gloomy album, as gloomy as something like Adramelch's Irae Melanox or Void of Silence's The Sky Over but it is violently tragic in how it explores this whether in its deeply pessimistic lyricism or its harmony-driven cruelties.\n\nEven the production adds to this atmosphere; it sounds kind of diminutive and distant but only because it's a mournful voice trapped in a massive, empty mansion where everything feels so much more distant and aged as if viewed as a lost child wandering where they really shouldn't. Still, I do wish it had a production closer to Gardens of Grief if only because that one was equally evocative while still letting every instrument be heard easily save for the snare drum during many of the blast sections (something this album thankfully didn't suffer for). Personally, I know rougher production jobs aren't for many people but for me, the enjoyment of a lot of early 90's death metal classics benefits from that kind of free for all approach where a production job can be \"wrong\" on paper yet give a release a kind of wild, strange, and entrancing character you won't get even with the upgrades to analog style production modern times have brought.\n\nThis isn't a very easy album to get into regardless; I was lucky I realized that it was basically an album to listen to for the polyphony first and then it immediately made sense to me, allowing me to figure out the structuring later. Still even if you are aware of that, it ignores a lot of the more accessible tropes that occasionally popped into a lot of death metal of its time. There's no FUCK YEAH HEADBANGING TIME 666 segments, no mosh friendly sections, no syncopated crunchy marching parts, no parts where they just \"let loose\" - everything here is anti-fun (thankfully) but it is also mystifying in its depressive atmosphere and its untamed idiosyncrasy. There's not a lot of albums like it (unsurprising given how difficult it would be to replicate a similar idea even with today's tech wizards) but that only makes it stand out more in a genre that today is as much proudly delving into the pure chaos of its past and boldly exploring the various newly opened frontiers of an emergent future. An album to cherish for all times.\n",
        "\nOn paper, this album shouldn't be bad and if anything, quite strong. Even as a complete change of style all the baseline ingredients that comprise it are perfectly fine and some might say they had been hinted at previously even during the Alf Svensson era. The musicians here we know are quite capable and the production at the least is crispy and clear. While calling this death metal would be a stretch, its combination of Slayer/Metallica esque tenacity and crunch with 80's Brit-metal melody a la Maiden and Priest is a perfectly fine idea even if the idea of what is functionally power/thrash wasn't anything new by 1995.\n\nAs the review score makes clear, none of this ends up working in practice.\n\nGenres for all the whining and complaining heaped upon them as limiting constructs are incredibly broad ones that encapsulate a wide variety of sounds but what is important to note is that they evolved in a very specific way in order to make their components work. Death metal vocals for example work because to make it as simple as possible they are a very harsh form of vocalization for an equally harsh form of music.\n\nAs you might have figured that's mostly why this doesn't work at all. At The Gates are basically trying to satisfying both camps here but what they've created suffers from two major flaws.\n\nThe first one is that the component pieces conflict one another inherently and never resolve this.\n\nThe music while highly aggressive in terms of pacing is essentially lukewarm and highly static palm mutes over mechanically rigid drumming in what is functionally just more melodic-than-usual thrash but they try to dress it up in the classic Swedeath guitar tone and put shrieky semi black metal howls over it. The riffing is ultimately too sweet, too smoothed out of any harsh edges (something the tone fails to hide), and just not particularly heavy for all of its ultimately rote chugga chugga widdling but the pounding tempos try but ultimately fail to change this by virtue of having to support a fundamentally broken idea. The vocals then proceed to clash with this; if the guitar work is ultimately too friendly, then the again harsh vocals contradict them; they don't fit against guitar work that's ultimately closer to more aggressive strains of power metal than the kind of extremity Tomas' voice demonstrated it was better suited to, like trying to put deep fried seafood on caramel coated ice cream but somehow thinking it will work.\n\n(This isn't to say that you can never resolve the divide that lead to extreme metal breaking from its relatively more rock adjacent predecessors but it requires highly specific configurations in order to give both sides of the coin the respect they're due. Lunar Shadow and The Chasm are good examples for heavy and death metal respectively and you could argue band like Martyr (Can) demonstrates this idea but for \"extreme prog\" just as well but that's an aside, back to the review.)\n\nThe second one is that even with what it has, it doesn't really pull off any of it in an even halfway convincing manner.\n\nAs someone who can enjoy all kinds of heavy/power/speed/thrash bands, even if you view the album as that instead of death metal, it arguably is even worse in some ways. For all of its vaunted melody, very little of it particularly stands out as much as it comes off as highly stilted, lacking a lot of the more explosive or colourful delivery you need to really make good on the flaunting of its sonic accessibility. While I'm not sure if we can say this is where the dreaded jugga-jugaa-weeee approach to gothen-metal necessarily started this album definitely goes out of your way to make you tired of it fast. A lot of the melodies themselves are mostly tacked onto similarly personality-free interchangeable chug rhythms that somehow make the most tepid of late 80's Bay Area styled thrash sound as spirited as Sadus or Blasphemer (Italy). I guess that's suppose to contrast the melodies and make them stand out more which is fine on paper but on that end, when they decide to show off it doesn't really amount to much either. Think of tiny snippets of the flashier parts of power metal arranged in incredibly stiff blink-and-you-miss-it blips and bleeps that suppress and actively work against any kind of more in depth expression possible.\n\nOccasionally they'll pull out a few leads here and there; maybe a ringing notes with a slower moving voice underneath it or a somewhat catchy if underdeveloped solo here and there, but they're too little and oftentimes too sparse and under-written to really amount to much than the effect of passing by an eye-catching advertisement on a very long, empty stretch of road for a car ride you'd wish would just end already. It's almost as if the only point of them is to remind you that \"oh hey, you thought that was nice? Too bad, back to the chugga.\" Yet even if you just stitched all of these melodies together and removed all the rhythm guitar, it would only be a marginally better album with how ultimately rote all of these patterns are. They're the sort of basic little snippets of fretboard jousting that results in the same kind of sterility as the dialed in riffing, equally stiff and constrained by the need for constant immediate-gratification high-velocity low-weight technique; highly flabby and often just kind of awkwardly hovering under a guitar tone that nearly buries it.\n\nI suppose if you just want some sort of vaguely angry, dramatically melodic background music to put on while you make a Call of Duty montage or you're reading Christopher Hitchens and The Mind Unleashed comment sections in your room because your parents grounded you for swearing in high school then this album might work as background music. Otherwise, there are an absurdly high number of quality albums in either more traditional metal domains or the extreme ones that do all of the things that comprise this album better than it every will, whether they're contemporaries to it, its predecessors, or from far after its unfortunate rise to prominence as the chief icon of 90's Swede-metal's failures.\n",
        "\nIn a time where the concept of melodic death metal had yet to be fully conceived, Gothenburg-based At the Gates came out with one of the most impenetrable melodic death metal albums ever made. Following a debut that drew attention for its experimental take on death metal, the band was looking to build a tighter and more aggressive sound. The result of their efforts was the intriguing With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness. No less shrouded in darkness and insanity than their previous material yet so much more fierce in its assault.\n\nOften regarded as one of At the Gates' weaker releases, With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness was deemed an ambitious but directionless album. The songwriting was often described as aimless and disjointed, supposedly resulting from the band trying to cram as many ideas as possible into each song. At the same time, however, the abstruse nature of With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkess is one of its most potent qualities.\n\nLargely written by Alf Svensson, the complex compositions are frantic and schizophrenic, displaying a level of technicality that would not make it unthinkable to count With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness among early technical death metal albums. Svensson's unusual method of occasionally reverse-engineering riffs from playing demos backwards resulted in songs that challenged the contemporary death metal sound.\n\nAs was the case with their debut, the drumming once again linked At the Gates to grindcore, to the point of the band being labeled \"swedish grind masters\" in a promotional vinyl pressing for the album. At the same time At the Gates further contributed to the formation of melodic death metal as the previously warring guitars started to sound more harmonic, forming a basic melodic core at the center of the dark inferno.\n\nShowing their progressive side on songs like Stardrowned and The Burning Darkness, At the Gates once more pushed the boundaries of death metal. The progressive bass playing during the intro to Stardrowned makes for an especially memorable moment due to its out-of-left-field effect. Centerpiece Primal Breath on the other hand comes closest to what can be considered a full-fledged melodic death metal song on this album.\n\nAs the longest song At the Gates have released to date, Primal Breath is a seven minute epic of picturesque lyrics and grand, wistful melodies. Slowly winding towards its climax similar melodic sensibilities can only be found in the racing, fiery guitars on Non-Divine or the disturbingly evil outro to Blood of the Sunsets.\n\nAt the front of the vicious and razorsharp instrumentation, Tomas Lindberg howls, bellows and roars, making more extensive use of the higher end of his register. As one of the most distinctive voices in 90s death metal, Lindberg's screams really drive home the insane and blasphemous imagery in his lyrics.\n\nAs something that is often neglected in metal, the lyrics for With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness are especially worth noting as they constitute one of the most fascinating aspects of the album. After the introspective The Red In The Sky Is Ours that put a heavy focus on themes of insanity, At the Gates now turned towards christianity and anti-religious themes. Mirroring the often counter-intuitive songwriting, the lyrics are cryptic, utilizing chromatics as well as cosmic and biblical symbolism.\n\nOn With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness Lindberg's lyricism once again paints vivid yet abstract images. Whereas songs like Primal Breath and The Break Of Autumn are remarkably pictorial, pieces like Blood of the Sunsets and Raped By The Light Of Christ bring back the surreal visuals of The Red In The Sky Is Ours.\n\nSimilarly to the instrumentation, however, it is never quite evident if any meaning found in Lindberg's lyrics is truly intentional. In this sense, the cover art for With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness perfectly captures the music on the album. The painting made by \u00c5ke Hodell titled \"220 Volt Buddha\" is a minimalistic piece. It can be assumed that a stained glass window can be seen from inside a building at nighttime. Bright moonlight floods in through the window, carrying a reflection of the motif on the glass. Below the window appears to be a small table on which a selection of flasks or similar containers can be seen. Tomas Lindberg recalls chancing upon the piece in an artbook and being struck by its sexual and religious symbolism as well as the beautiful colors.\n\nFor those receptive to it an ominous but irresistably alluring maze of unfathomable darkness will unfold on With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness, whereas more pragmatic listeners may find an album that lost itself somewhere along the way in a rush of ambition. Nevertheless, and if only for this contrast, With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness remains an enigmatic piece of death metal history.\n\nAttribution: https://www.noisevortex.com/articles/looking-back-at-the-gates-with-fear-i-kiss-the-burning-darkness/\n",
        "\n\"Gardens of Grief\" is my favourite At the Gates recording. There's no other release from this band, which I would like so much. But this EP is really great and definitely belongs to the best early 90\u2019s death metal materials from Sweden. I remember that I did have to take some time to convince myself to it, but once it all clicked, \"Gardens...\u201d blew my head off. Why such problems with getting into this music? Well, \"Gardens of Grief\" is not the typical Swedish death metal effort - if typical Swedish death metal means stuff from Entombed, Dismember, Unleashed or Grave. At the Gates went a different path and came up with their more complex song structures, unique and frequent tempo changes within every song and quite technical, almost thrashing riffs. Stylistically it really stands aside to everything! Of corpse there were some other more technical and bizarre sounding bands, like Afflicted, Carbonized, Therion for instance, even early In Flames... but At the Gates were living in their own weird world. \n\n\"Gardens of Grief\", unlike the future At the Gates material, isn't really so much melodic. It focuses more on twisted, sick, mindblowing riffs - just listen to what\u2019s going on there, it is just fantastic cacophonous death metal, which can sound aggressive and vicious, dark and evil. And as such, it's just a natural follow up to Grotesque's final recording, which was \"Incantation\" MLP. Sure, there are some sort of melodic parts here and there, but their feeling is rather uncanny and eerie. Complex song structure and arrangements create a bit difficult and not easy music, it\u2019s hard to memorize (check the song \"At the Gates\" especially). This is why I think it really requires time to get into all these. But it turns out that it's the strongest aspect of \"Gardens of Grief\" - that bizarre feel combined with truly dark, morbid aura. It just sounds awesome, I love all these broken rhythms, sonic attack from both guitarist and Tompa\u2019s furious screams. I love how the band sounds here, how unique At the Gates were at the time of this EP. They had crazy ideas and enough freakin\u2019 talent to transform them into killer music. \n\nAll in all, these are some impressive and very important twenty minutes of death metal. For me it's the best At the Gates release. I got the recent vinyl version from Hammerheart and I have to say it's a solid reissue. I like that it's just one sided vinyl, so I don't have to flip sides after two songs. And the sound is damn good also! Very recommended if you don\u2019t want to spend too much money on the old pressing. \n\nStandout track: \"All Life Ends\" \n\nVerdict: 95/100\n",
        "\n\"Gardens of Grief\" is the best thing At the Gates ever did. These four songs show Tomas Lindberg and Alf Svensson building on the style they developed with Grotesque. Svensson dominates the song-writing here in ways he never could with Grotesque (where Necrolord was at the helm). His style is unique, disjointed, dense and sometimes nonsensical. His approach to song-writing involves developing tapestries of riffs, twisting each riff beyond breaking point, then weaving melody into the few remaining gaps. \n\nAnyone familiar with the debut At the Gates album (\"The Red in the Sky is Ours\") will know what to expect from this. Still, there are key differences between the two recordings. \"Gardens of Grief\" is gloomier, slower, more measured, has fewer speed passages and less melody. Lindberg's vocals are deeper and more varied (with a deranged, narrative quality). The biggest difference is the production. Their debut album was self-produced and suffered from a pissweak guitar tone. \"Gardens of Grief\" was recorded at Studio Sunlight. It has a proper 'death metal' production, the best they ever achieved. Play this at low volumes and it still sounds amazing.\n\nSong-wise, early At the Gates is an acquired taste. This is almost the antithesis of the lean, thrashy approach taken on \"Slaughter of the Soul\". The listener must attune themselves to Svensson's unique death metal vision. \"Souls of the Evil Departed\" is a horrifying opener, contorted to the edge of musical acceptability. Every idea rubs against the next and the friction is unbearable. The song \"At the Gates\" offers a series of tortured grooves and tremolo-picked melodies, with glimpses of the earliest Gothenburg melo-death sound (the riff at around 1:56 perhaps). The band's approach borders on the avant-garde at times, but they maintain a death metal heaviness they never matched on subsequent recordings. \n\nThe second half is better still. \"All Life Ends\" is a legitimate At the Gates classic. It begins with lyrics paraphrased from Mad Max 2, then rushes into a series of impenetrable phrases, collisions and breakdowns. A lifeline appears at around 2:50, following the densest, most savage part of the song. An extended note mutates into a groove with some single notes played over the top. This moment releases the tension and provides a 'hook', then everything descends into madness again. The final track \"City of Screaming Statues\" is my personal favourite. This is a throbbing, wobbling, slithering masterpiece of chaos and resolution. At the Gates re-recorded this song on their debut album. Play the two versions back to back and see which one you think is superior. There is no comparison. \n\n\"Gardens of Grief\" is the place to end your At the Gates journey. This is one of the key death metal recordings of all time and could be the greatest death metal demo of the lot. Essential.\n",
        "\nTo Drink from the Night Itself is the sixth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band At the Gates who are made up by Tomas Lindberg on vocals, Adrian Erlandsson on the drums, Jonas Bj\u00f6rler on bass, Martin Larsson on rhythm guitar, Jonas St\u00e5lhammar on lead guitar who replaced long time member and co-founder Anders Bj\u00f6rler, who had departed from the band in March 2017. To Drink From The Night Itself was released on 18 May 2018 through Century Media. The album is the first to feature guitarist Jonas St\u00e5lhammar and the first without co-founder Anders Bj\u00f6rler.\n\nAt The Gates biggest blessing but also their biggest curse is that with every album the expectations for them are ridiculously high due to the fact they continue to release phenomenal albums. To Drink From The Night Itself is no different from any other album in the fact that it is a great album, however unlike their latest albums Slaughter Of The Soul and At War With Reality it does have far more flaws.\n\nMy biggest concern with To Drink From The Night Itself was the pacing issues, the album stats off incredibly slow for an At The Gates album. This failed to immediately grab my attention which in turn made it harder for me to remain focused on the album. Which for new listeners could be all it takes for them to pack their bags and hit the road. Another issue I had were the endings of some of the songs. Certain tracks ended with violins or with quiet church like chants that intended to feel eerie ended up failing to build up the tempo and keep the flow into the next track. However thank god I decided to give it a chance because the album does get really good later on.\n\nYou will know when you get to the real At The Gates album you were expecting once you reach the title track, and trust me you better hang on to your seat because At The Gates are about to bring the heat straight from Satan himself. This is the At The Gates of old we have come to expect. We are hit with classic screams that will make your neighbours look at you with fear, guitars that will burn down your house and deadly drums that will wake the entire block up. It may have taken At The Gates longer than usual to convince me they are the best melodic death metal band of all time, but the later half of this album assured me that i wasn't wrong with saying that. This album review is a little different in the fact that I will not be listing the albums standout tracks due to the fact the first half isn't very strong.\n\nSo there you have it, another Metal All The Time review and another At The Gates review. I was hoping I could give this album 90% or a 100% but as I have said before the album just starts to slow for my personal enjoyment when listening to a metal album. Now it could be due to the fact they have injected a new guitarist into the mix for the first time and they are still figuring out the new chemistry with the band. But in the end I could only give the band an 85% on this album sadly.\n",
        "\n\"To Drink from the Night Itself\" is a worthy successor to \"At War With Reality.\" Let me be clear: I only say that due to its exploitation of a sound long since spoiled and the sheer lack of depth the first At The Gates reunion album so elegantly captured. The only thing to see here is this once-great tribe faltering beneath the \"Slaughter of the Soul\" mold and the instrumental misgivings of The Haunted providing what is essentially 'Round 2' of the At The Gates reunion. I've always been a fan of letting stuff that is dead stay dead. Call me crazy, but I'm all for keeping legacies intact and not squandering them. Guess what I thought about At The Gates releasing new material. Guess what I think about this.\u00a0\n\nThe gentlemen of At The Gates, all capable and worthy of the respect they've earned, have no need to answer to a semi-alcoholic asshat such as myself or take my criticisms to heart. After all, an album like \"To Drink from the Night Itself\" has an audience, and I'm sure plenty of people enjoy it. I just happen not to be one of them due to a myriad of grievances. Normally I wouldn't have bothered with this, but it's been a boring day at the office and I don't have shit to do, so fuck it. And no, I'm not in league with those swiveling manbabies who insist \"Slaughter of the Soul\" put At The Gates in the gutter/they were only good before \"Slaughter of the Soul\"/there hasn't been a good metal album since 1993/streaming is, like, bad for metal, because, it's, like, bad, maaaaaan.\n\nI like \"Slaughter of the Soul\" for what it is. It has its flaws, but it's a renowned album and has made its case to be among the classics, which I can't refute. I'm more fond of \"With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness\" and \"The Red in the Sky is Ours\" (which is one of my all-time favorites), although At The Gates was fine afterwards. Funny as it may be, At The Gates was the only group to nail the \"Slaughter of the Soul\" sound correctly. That may seem like a redundant/stupid statement given they pretty much created the identity, but its short shelf-life was written on the wall right from the jump. The simple riffs and structures did the trick. That's when it should have ended. Fast forward several years, everyone and their brother has tried to retrace the album in every which way. Hell, there was a time where these acts were around every corner. Where are they now? Disbanded and erased from memory. Why? Because the \"Slaughter of the Soul\" identity is gravely limited to a few gags that get real old, real quick.\u00a0\n\nAt The Gates is one of my favorite bands, and that's not going to change, but this sure isn't helping. The reunion stuff has been abysmal. I saw them live for the first time a few years ago and couldn't be arsed to care about anything, watching a former titan sleepwalk through all their newer drivel and obligatory \"Slaughter of the Soul\" cuts. No love for anything else. I honestly felt more inclined to avoid this altogether. I disliked \"At War With Reality\" and thought At The Gates was running on empty. What was left to experience? We all knew exactly how this was going to sound. No one can convince me otherwise, and anyone who wants to think this would have been some grand creative endeavor is kidding themselves. If \"At War With Reality\" made one core point, it's that the mystery and wonder of At The Gates have been absorbed by the familiar and safe. If the group's first four albums were fresh and exploratory, then consider \"To Drink from the Night Itself\" the cheap caricature of those lucrative days.\u00a0\n\nI don't need to describe the record all that much. It starts where the last album left off - there are several parallels - and runs in circles for forty-five minutes. Bland riffs and other banalities courtesy of The Haunted have carried over. The riffs are stuck emulating the simplistic style At The Gates created without the bark or bite of their seminal breakthrough. All the predictable, dull riffs are glazed over that up-tempo drum beat they use ad nauseam, or they occasionally switch to one of the other limited this-or-that tempos the band falls back on when its time to stop doing the same damn thing over and over again, and Tomas Lindberg barks over everything. I've always liked his vocals, so they get a pass. The first few songs, however, bleed with the realization that even At The Gates, the architect of this sound, has nowhere left to go. The one song with enough spine to try something beyond the mold is \"The Mirror Black,\" and although it's not too enticing itself, at least its somber tone and violins are a nice change-up. The guitar solos are semi-captivating as well - a carryover from the last album, and one of its few redeeming qualities. I think that's it. Better than nothing, I guess.\u00a0\n\nThe label or At The Gates themselves implied (or maybe they didn't, my memory gets a little fuzzy these days due to age, booze, Korsakoff's setting in, etc.) this would have hints of weirdness \u00e0 la the older albums. That, I'm afraid, is a bunch of malarkey. \"The Chasm\" has a different drum pattern compared to the other songs, which all use the limited other drum patterns that are echoed and retraced pointlessly throughout this and the last crappy album they did. Maybe there's an unusual clean guitar or some change in tone here and there? That's about it. This is a rare example where even something stupid would have added a little zest. Hey, At The Gates, throw in a banjo or something - just spice up this trash. I'm not saying At The Gates would have earned more props if they did, but this is just so goddamn boring. I'd take a risk that blows up in their face than another one of those \"Slaughter of the Soul\" knockoffs. And you exactly how they sound. Even if you're scoffing at this review and think I'm a big dumb meaniehead because you think this is the 'most tightest stuff ever,' you can't deny anyone can mentally conjure up a replication of a \"Slaughter of the Soul\" riff or song with little to no thought. It's that easy to do, the consequences are clear as day, and that's why this style stinks. Remember detailed, contorting numbers like \"The Architects,\" or \"Through Gardens of Grief,\" or \"And the World Returned,\" or something that at least didn't bore you to tears?\u00a0\n\nI've read my fair share of positive reviews of this and \"At War With Reality,\" and a semi-consistent argument I've seen is that they are both excellent/good because At The Gates is a legendary act, as though that is some form of valid reasoning? Give me a break. This would have been torn to bits had it been released by one of the dime-a-dozen knockoffs emulating \"Slaughter of the Soul\" to...do what exactly? Is this really a sound that needs further exploration? Better question: is this sound capable of exploration? Betterer question: did it ever need to be replicated or worshiped? Shouldn't \"Slaughter of the Soul\" have been a one-and-done deal? Well, give \"To Drink from the Night Itself\" a spin and make your assessment. You are entitled to think this is a quality direction for any band to take, of course. But you'd be wrong, because my opinion is right: this sound is dated and played-out. It's just a shame to see a group once flowing with a boundless creativity reduced to mere remains of its former self. I said it once, and I'll say it again: Stay dead, please.\u00a0\n",
        "\nIn 1995, At the Gates released their magnum opus Slaughter of the Soul to the world. It was an album that influenced numerous melodic death metal bands as well as a bunch of cookie cutter metalcore bands. But due to the sheer influence it had on many bands, one could ask as to why this album is widely praised. For starters, every song is among At the Gates' most well known tracks. All songs on Slaughter of the Soul are killer cuts with no skipping required.\n\n\"Blinded by Fear\" starts Slaughter of the Soul which is a strong example of At the Gates' thrashy brand of melodic death metal. It is widely considered At the Gates' signature song and also a defining anthem of Gothenburg metal. \"Cold\" is another noteworthy highlight containing some of the coolest riffs on the album in addition to having a neoclassical guitar solo provided by Andy Larocque of King Diamond fame. \"Into the Dead Sky\" is a really well written acoustic instrumental which showcases At the Gates' versatility. A notable late album highlight is \"Nausea\" which is probably the fastest song on Slaughter of the Soul and has a wicked guitar solo to boot.\n\nAt the Gates knew at the time it was difficult to balance speed with melody but they made it happen. Tomas Lindberg's screams are as vicious and angry as the lyrics he wrote on Slaughter of the Soul. Anders Bj\u00f6rler and Martin Larsson are probably one of the best guitar tag teams in death metal and they play some really wicked solos such as on \"Under a Serpent Sun\" and the title track. Jonas Bj\u00f6rler's bass playing is also fantastic as songs like \"Cold\" and \"Need\" display some of the best atmosphere on Slaughter of the Soul. Adrian Erlandsson's drumming takes more cues from old-school death metal and annihilates the listener on tracks such as \"Blinded by Fear\" and \"Nausea\".\n\nAlthough At the Gates began as an old-school death metal band, they truly developed their sound with Slaughter of the Soul. This album is nowadays considered the band's signature album and one of the best metal albums of all time. Slaughter of the Soul defined melodic death metal along with The Gallery and The Jester Race and is generally considered the best album within this subgenre of death metal. Heck, I could listen to this album a million times and it would never get old. This is coming from a guy who likes death metal. If you're looking to get into melodic death metal, whether you're a metalcore kid or a OSDM fanatic, this is a fantastic album for beginners.\n",
        "\nThe Red in the Sky is Ours, in my humble opinion, is possibly the greatest metal album of all time. I truly mean this. I have listened to metal for over 15 years, and this album has remained my number one since I first listened to it 10 years ago. After waiting for so long, I decided to write a review for it, in order to argue why it can be considered as the GOAT of heavy metal. \n\nThis album pushes all aspects of metal music to its limits, and somewhat ironically, transcends the genre itself by doing so. The music in this album is so extreme in terms of the dissonance, tempo changes, and song structures, that it barely resembles any traditional heavy metal music. For instance, besides a few key notes, The Red in the Sky is Ours has few similarities with Black Sabbath, the creators of the metal genre. Yes, this album does contain riffs, which is a defining feature of the metal genre, but they are just a backdrop of the music, rarely emphasized. Compare that to this album\u2019s closest relatives, like the early works of Entombed and Dismember, who not only promote riffs but glorify them. \n\nNonetheless, The Red in the Sky is Ours remains loyal to metal. Every sound is created by the fundamentals of extreme metal: heavily distorted guitars, a bass, fast drums, and harsh vocals. The Red in the Sky is Ours, in this sense, embodies the purest form of metal. This may seem like a trivial point, but it is one of the primary factors that makes this album so unique. With traditional metal instruments alone, it succeeds in becoming abrasive, extreme, and abnormal. There are no gimmicks, no special atmospheres, avante-garde effects, or unique instruments (besides an occasional violin, but more on that later). There are no stylistic gimmicks either, such as the fusion of different genres. Even the production, being treble-heavy, emphasizes the instruments rather than obfuscating them. You can hear the raw talent in every note produced by each musician. Guitarists Anders Bjorler and Alf Svensson play mind blowing riffs made of lightning-speed tremolo picking, sometimes finding harmony, sometimes eerily diverging into polyphonic sounds. Then, there is bassist Jonas Bjorler, who infuses elements of jazz into the mix with his groovy bass lines, sometimes even taking control of the riffs himself. Drummer Adrian Erlandsson plays with god-like technique and taste, using blast-beats sparingly while relying more on his creativity. And of course, vocalist Tomas Lindberg unleashes unrivaled passion and energy, sounding somewhere between death metal growls and black metal shrieks. Overall, The Red in the Sky is Ours rests on each member\u2019s creativity in the forms of aggression, technical skills, and songwriting. \n\nHaving said all that, I think one musician in particular played a far greater role than the others: Alf Svensson. Anders Bjorler claimed that it was Svensson who brought the \u201cover the top\u201d and \u201cstrange\u201d guitarwork into the album. Perhaps the contrasting styles of the two guitarists could explain why the album was able to find such balance between melody and dissonance. It\u2019s also no wonder the band devolved as soon as Svensson left. So I think it\u2019s important to give credit to Svensson, who arguably made the most significant contributions to this album.\n\nThe album, however, isn\u2019t just the sum of its parts. As a whole, it\u2019s something much greater, with a narrative and purpose. The Red in the Sky is Ours\u2019 release is an act of moving as far from the conventional, \u201cacceptable\u201d forms of music as possible. As a result, it symbolizes a form of anarchy, resisting capitalist consumerism. It is the metal community\u2019s best answer to the corporate music industry. Even compared to its extreme metal brethren, The Red in the Sky is Ours is alien, abrasive, dissonant, and chaotic. Take the title track, for example, which opens with some of the most bizarre riffs metal has ever heard, even to this day. There are also strong elements of progressive death metal, perhaps most resembling Atheist, but with far less pandering to the typical metalhead, let alone the average music listener. The shock continues as the track unleashes a flurry of dissonant riffs, ceaselessly jarring the listener, until finishing with the violin piece. Even the violin syncs with the purpose of the album. It sounds eerie, bleak, and maybe a little \u201coff.\u201d It\u2019s a reminder that even an instrument as \u201cgraceful\u201d as the violin, a classical instrument meant for pleasant sounds, is not sacred. The violin\u2019s introduction at the end of the title track also serves as a foreshadow of what is to come. As such, it\u2019s less of a gimmick and more as an icon. \n\nThe narrative of the album is my favorite part of it. It follows no formulas, whether it is traditional verse-chorus-verse forms or just churning an endless assembly line of riffs. Instead, the riffs evolve and build on themes that carry over into later tracks. The mid-album trio consisting of Windows, Claws of Laughter Dead, and Neverwhere are a good example of that how some of the major themes develop. The transitions between these three tracks are so seamless that they feel like a single continuous track, creating a level of immersion only a classical symphony could produce. In the larger context, this trio represents a rise in tension, leading to a climax. Take the riffs in Windows, for example, which are tight, tremolo-packed, and melodic. Before the tension is released, a new act takes over in Claws of Laughter Dead, which is even more packed with epic riffs, pushing the album into an even more claustrophobic space. Again, this track ends without ever releasing the tension, and without even a warning. That\u2019s when Neverwhere begins, which consists of some of the most genius riffing in the entire album. Suddenly, the disorienting tempo-changes and unpredictable progressions are united with the highly melodic sections of past tracks. Even the violin finds its way in. Lindberg screams, \u201cLife doesn\u2019t belong here!\u201d as if acknowledging the album\u2019s nihilistic deconstruction of everything that was released before it. \n\nWe enter Neverwhere. Or, perhaps, we are trapped in it.\n\nTo me, Neverwhere is the heart of the album, because it\u2019s the climax of the story of The Red in the Sky is Ours. It offers a strange sense of self-aware nihilism, revealing how this moment was destined to occur. It should not come as a surprise that Svensson wrote the lyrics to this track. Maybe he is offering some insight into the story:\n\n\u201cNow awaited, the circle to close\nWe wait for the call - Lazaraus come out\nWe wait in the shadows of Neverwhere\u201d\n\nAfter Neverwhere ends, the album moves into the resolution. The Scar is a beautiful moment of self-reflection, especially in the aftermath of Neverwhere. It is one of those perfectly placed breathers that balances the intensity of the chaos at just the right time. \n\nAt The Gates could have ended the album right there. But, come on. This is The Red in the Sky is Ours. There\u2019s nothing predictable about this album. The onslaught brought forth by Night Comes, Blood Black and City of Screaming Statues remind me of Neverwhere, as if I was trapped inside a nightmare within a nightmare all along. Resolution doesn\u2019t really \u201cresolve\u201d anything. The night still comes, and the city\u2019s statues are scream. \n\nThis brings me to an important point I make earlier. The Red in the Sky is Ours is an album that is metal in style, but something more in substance. It feels as though the boundaries of metal are blurred, as At the Gates consistently ignore (or neglect) all genre traditions. If anything, it feels more like a symphony, reminding me of classical composers such as Beethoven and Shostakovich. Even in the design of the melodies, and the way tremolo picking is utilized, a sense of grandness is invoked. The way those melodies are blended with the chaos, too, is unparalleled. It\u2019s how melodic death metal should be, unlike the later melodeath scene saturated with trite formulas. \n\nTo conclude, The Red in the Sky is Ours is a revolutionary album. As of 2019, it has been nearly 30 years since it was released, and I haven\u2019t listened to an album as challenging and satisfying as this one. If I listen to something better, I guarantee I will resubmit this review with a different score. But until then, 100% it is.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates. The legendary Gothenburg metallers, considered among the fathers of melodic death metal, the innovators of the European extreme music scene, thanks to some really classic works of art, such as their immortal fourth opus. Indeed, few albums have had an impact as wide and resounding on the world of extreme music as At the Gates' \"Slaughter of the Soul\", and I'll tell you this: although it's certainly true that, at times, being an influential record doesn't justify certain albums being claimed as \"legendary masterpieces\", this isn't the case when talking about \"Slaughter of the Soul\".\n\nIn a CD of less more than just 34 minutes of duration, At the Gates deliver an unrelenting, yet catchy and melodic, musical assault, one to be praised and revered by all the future generations to come. The magic in here is plain for everyone to see: be it the inspired songwriting, the originality (at least, for the era the album was born in) of the compositions, the incredible atmosphere of the record, Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m's legendary production, the fantastic performances of all the band's members: each element perfectly complements the others, being exalted and contributing to the perfection of the mix.\n\nThe songs are the perfect example of what melodic death metal is meant to be: the band abandons the canons of traditional death metal, to venture forth and push towards new boundaries. As a result, the drumming is less technical and abandons some typical death metal beats, such as the blast beats; the songs' structures are simpler, with the tracks being simpler, shorter and more hook-laden. The guitars are tuned down to B standard, with their riffing being extremely melodic, rather than focusing on technicality, which is also true and clearly evident when talking about the solos, that aren't even present in all the songs. \n\nThere's a wider use of samples, of synth effects here and there, to create the atmosphere, thanks also to some excellent arpeggiated sessions; the most complex scales, such as, say, the arab scales, are abandoned, as well as chromatic scales and chromaticism. The whole approach tends to be simpler, to catch the attention of the listener thanks to the fantastic contrast between melodic, catchy guitar work and Tomas Lindberg's legendary harsh screams. A special mention goes to the frontman's trademark vocals, that prove to be really excellent and unique, a fundamental key to the success of the album.\n\nLegendary producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m did one hell of a job with this record: the guitars sound heavy, a bit raw and fuzzy, their tone is full and powerful, but not overwhelming; the mix is just perfect, and really matches the dark and grievous atmosphere of the album and of Lindberg's wonderful, well-studied and pessimistic lyrics, dealing with themes of inner struggle, social issues, death, resulting much more introspective and self-related than traditional death metal lyrics.\n\nThe tracks are all top notch, starting with the legendary three-punch combo of \"Blinded by Fear\", the title track and \"Cold\", each one featuring absolutely memorable, diversified riffing and instantly unforgettable choruses; \"Under a Serpent Sun\" is distinguished by a gloomy tremolo-picked intro, while \"Suicide Nation\" and \"Need\" include some of the most beautiful melodies, the first one being probably the most aggressive song of the lot, thanks to the pounding drums, the aggressive riffing and the tempo changes, the second being absolutely melancholic, perfect to end the album. There are also two short instrumentals, serving as calmer and atmospheric moments that enhance the whole listening experience.\n\nWhat else should I say? \"Slaughter of the Soul\" is a legendary record, whose wide impact and influence in the world of metal is matched only by its outstanding quality and replayability value. A must for any music lover, especially for fans of extreme music and melodic death metal in particular.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates is an institution in heavy metal and, alongside In Flames, a crucial yardstick for melodic death metal. After initially reforming for some high profile shows, the group announced that they would reverse their decision not to write more songs, releasing At War with Reality in 2014 to mixed reactions. Continuing the trend on their sixth full-length, At the Gates seems a band unsure how to handle their own legacy.\n\nThe sound pioneered by the Swedes on the seminal Slaughter of the Soul has been ripped off and rehashed countless times since, and the most damning criticism of To Drink from the Night Itself is to say that At the Gates have become their own imitators. Old stage guitarist Martin Larsson and new partner Jonas St\u00e5lhammar (also of Bombs of Hades) seem content to throw out several familiar riffs per song, often kicking off each composition with the momentum of an energetic but generic mid-paced idea, while Adrian Erlandsson keeps time around it with a fraction of his considerable skill. Opening \u2018Daggers of Black Haze\u2019 with a steal of their own \u2018Primal Breath\u2019 proves that inspiration ran low during recording, nor is that the only direct reference to the past. Jonas Bj\u00f6rler, as he has learned to do, mostly hides, exposing a disappointing vocal performance by Tomas Lindberg. At least the lyrics remain intriguing, Lindberg continuing his obsession with the themes of Jorge Luis Borges (labyrinths and implausible realities), the band also attempting to generate variety by the use of strings and acoustic guitars on several tracks, not least the opener and closer.\n\nThough largely redundant, To Drink from the Night Itself certainly sounds good and will doubtless inspire the devotion of some old fans. Russ Russell has done a fine job tweaking the knobs to give some polish and depth to the band\u2019s ideas, while \u2018The Chasm\u2019 and \u2018Palace of Lepers\u2019 offer excitement and interest when the five sterling musicians gel even slightly. Objectively, therefore, the latest At the Gates album cannot be described as poor; simply, given the context of the band that created it, To Drink from the Night Itself must be called a disappointment. More\u2019s the pity.\n\n\nOriginally written for Metalegion #4 - www.metalegion.com\n",
        "\nAt The Gates is very straightforward melodic death metal and one of the first bands in the genre. Undeniably an important name, however I'm sad to say that this album doesn't support that claim. For one of the very first bands to take this direction which has by now become pretty much a classic style and having nearly 30 years of activity behind them, their latest release is quite a disappointment.\n\nI'll be honest, this sort of very direct songwriting style with just verses, choruses, guitar solos and all songs staying in the 3 to 4 minutes area isn't exactly my cup of tea. But that is not the reason why I find this to be a let down. I've seen a lot of bands do it right. A simple song can either be catchy and engaging or just boring. I'm afraid the latter is quite abundant here. Apart from a few enjoyable songs like \"Daggers of Black Haze\" or the title track, the rest just feels like fill-in material.\n\nI haven't listened to this band before and now that I have, I'm a bit bummed that I started out with this album. I'm quite certain they must have done it better in the past but after hearing this album I'm not exactly inclined to hear more. Their songwriting is very basic melodic death metal. You get 4/4 time signatures pretty much all the time and they have a few catchy and enjoyable riffs and melodies. But that's really all they have to offer. The drums are really not that impressive and just keep the structure and bass is barely audible. Upon this, the harsh vocals that should usually bring the force in melo-death are tired and inexpressive. The vocals are probably the most disappointing aspect of the whole thing. \n\nBeyond this rather mediocre execution, the album has even more problems. The production for one, just doesn't work. I'm not looking for perfect hi-fi sound like you'd find in modern progressive or tech-death bands but is it so much to ask to hear the bass and make some sense of the cymbals or get a little depth? Also it's critically redundant. You have a decent intro, a few inspired melodies, the piano intro for \"Daggers of Black Haze\" and the strings in the end of the last song. And that's the diversity for you. The rest is bland and boring copy/paste riffing that feels completely flat. A few guitar solos make up for it but those aren't exactly brilliant either. All the songs start straight into it, end suddenly and have absolutely no change in pace, energy or sound throughout. Some clean guitars and the previously mentioned solos are all that's used to break the monotony and they fail quite miserably. I never thought death metal could be so benign.\n\nI'll admit, it's not all bad. In fact, \"bad\" isn't really the word for it. There's nothing in the album that I dislike as such. But they just don't cut it. Everything the album is made of has been done before and it has been done better. It is slightly enjoyable and has a few highlights but overall, it's completely irrelevant and just not worth its run time. I don't know if they lack inspiration or just got bored and tired and didn't even try but this album just isn't going anywhere. It's the embodiment of mediocrity. I can see these songs working live but a full listen of the studio album is just a waste of time. If melodic death is by far your favorite genre then maybe you'l enjoy it but even in that case there's a lot of stuff you should rather be listening to.\n",
        "\nAt The Gates are another OG metal band bringing out a new LP in 2018, making it an exciting year across all the genres. They were one of the major pioneers of the Gothenburg death metal sound but we\u2019re here to see if they did anything with that sound beyond helping to create it. A thing with ancient bands is that they usually try to stick to the older styles that inspired them to form a band, and then the styles of their peers that helped continue to shape the scene around them. They pretty much ignore the developing trends and genre combinations that are so popular right now. This is can good and bad\u2026 or it can just be a big bland in between. \n\nTo Drink From The Night Itself doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of changes to the formula but it doesn\u2019t waste their time or ours by putting out a bad product either. It just doesn\u2019t inspire much. It\u2019s death metal for when you just broke up with your girlfriend and so you\u2019re drinking beers with a friend you don\u2019t hang with unless you\u2019re feeling destructive. On one hand it\u2019s a necessary kind of music to have exist, on the other hand it doesn\u2019t feel animated, like I don\u2019t particularly want to move to it. \n\nThere\u2019s a bit of repetition with the riffs \u2013 a lot of the time it\u2019s very similar riffs throughout with variations on it played throughout. I swear \u201cDer Widerstand\u201d and \u201cPalace of Lepers\u201d use the same base riff, like the exact same riff. If you can get into the sound, then there is a lot of it here. I can give them that, they have a style and theme and then they stick with it consistently. Which is a long time to maintain that because this album has a ballsack worth of tracks. 17 tracks for a little over an hour worth of At The Gates\u2019 brand of metal (for the deluxe version, otherwise 13 original tracks). Value for money if you\u2019re a fan or even just liked some of their other stuff.\n\nThe highlights of the album are the guitars. Everything else kind of melds into the background and barely asks for any notice until key moments in a song. The guitars have a lot of moments to show off their high-pitched solos and clean guitar compositions. These are the times my ears usually perk up but beyond that there honestly isn\u2019t much to actually listen to, you mostly just put it on and hear it happening between intervals of getting distracted by the internet. The vocals are by no means bad, they\u2019re perfectly suitable for the music. Really, really suitable. \n\nI would put this in the above-average category for the genre but not an essential part of it. At The Gates do have a unique sound but you\u2019ll find better examples of it being implemented in their previous releases. In all honesty I think they are a talented band with some good ideas \u2013 It\u2019s just the genre of melodic death metal that\u2019s the real problem. It\u2019s a genre based on big climatic and often emotional moments but the biggest chunk of the songs is tediously leading up to that moment. At The Gates definitely do a better job at keeping the lead ups aggressive at least. \nTwenty \u2013 Or even ten years ago this would have been on all the top ten lists and essential metal recommendations. Since then A LOT of stuff has happened to metal, possibly in death metal more than any other genre. So many variations and fusions. The common presence of \u2018core\u2019 elements used and modern recording specifications. I\u2019m not saying these are essential to the genre now but they would benefit from a sound mix that allows headphone wearers to be able to hear every little detail in the playing. The current mix is a bit muddled up on the back-line and the vocals only sound a little louder than that.\n\nDespite the problems mentioned above this is still a confident release from the band, they haven\u2019t completely shit the bed or anything like that. It is awesome, they just repeat that awesome too much instead of making room for additional units of awesome. \n\nAt the very least they have one unit so it\u2019s all good.\n",
        "\nMy personal favorite At the Gates album is Terminal Spirit Disease. The way the orchestration blends into the metal on \"The Swarm\" left a mark I'll never forget. Then they returned with At War with Reality. I was really digging it and was patiently waiting a follow-up. The album art is amazing and right up my alley, so maybe I started hyping it up too much.\n\nLike I mentioned in the title, the songs sound a bit average. The band is operating at capacity but there's not much to really catch your attention other than a few great moments, like the unique guitar play on \"Palace of Lepers\", or the powerful chorus on \"Daggers of Black Haze\" and \"The Chasm\". There isn't a song I didn't enjoy on it but nothing that I loved or that will keep me coming back for much more. Their unique sound is obvious on every track and would be a reason for me to return if I want to scratch that itch. Granted, they have better albums to satiate that urge. There's also some enjoyably unique riffage on \"Seas of Starvation\" so I know they have the ability to write some unique material, just aren't doing it often enough here.\n\nAnders Bjorler had left the band but apparently had written all his lead guitar work, but the new guitarist just came in and recorded it. I would like to see what the new blood would bring to the writing on their next release. He seems to be able to proficiently fill the shoes of Anders. The drums are great at keeping time but never experiment enough to devote a whole listen-through to just them. The vocals have some nice stand out moments and they never once falter from evoking a melancholic rage. Tomas Lindberg has perfected his voice over the years but he just needs some better material on which he can use it. At times I got a little tired of it because of the sameness. This is like on most of their records but usually the music can override and still make something interesting out of it.\n\nFavorite tracks:\n--Palace of Lepers\n--A Labyrinth of Tombs\n--Daggers of Black Haze\n\nTechnical skill: 52% Originality: 60% Production: 76% Song writing: 42% Accessibility: 59%\n",
        "\nRehash from the \"Slaughter of the Soul\" days, this fresh new release is ATG's finest in years. With a \"raw\" production sound, these melodic death metal freaks pound out some serious melodic death. Still have the fire after all these years, amazing their still kicking ass with their signature sound. Total Gothenburg type quintet and they did a great job here. Happy that I found this album at the record store, I wasn't aware that they are still active and touring for the new release. They hit home with me. The music is flashback to \"Slaughter...\" with a modern form of melodic death. And the vocals haven't really changed either. Still high pitched voice and heavy down tuned guitars.\n\nThese guys have nothing but good things to contribute to the metal community. Not everyone is pleased with the sound of melodic death, but I am. They really don't have many leads (if any) it's mostly rhythm guitars. That's fine by me, I was never really a fan of theirs in the lead department. The music is dark and it's probably the most dark release I've heard more so than their predecessor. This album does justice in the metal community it just has so much to offer. Every song is unique and awesome. I've found that they really are stuck to their roots and that's what made the most difference in their album.\n\nThe tempos aren't very fast just the guitars set the tone for each song. The vocals match well with the music. They're really a talented band and never dying out. It seems like they're going to do more writing. Let's hope. The album is about 45 minutes long and only has a few bits of non-distortion guitars. The intro to the album is actually acoustic and the outro has (I think) a violin. There are small piano bits too, but not for an extensive period of time. The guitars are mostly the tone to the album. I like how it's raw because it makes the music more dark and depressing. Something I think that they're good at.\n\nI actually found the album before I knew it was on Spotify. I was happy to get a physical copy to this release. It's a great album and the musicianship is appalling. They truly know how to make their music to people's liking. I've found them to be a band that truly is a milestone in the community of metal. I would suggest that people into any genre of metal buy this album and show the band support for creating excellent music and keep on keeping on as they age. The fire is still alive in them and maybe that'll be for an eternity till they're no more. Do yourself a favor and check this one out. If you liked \"Slaughter of the Soul\", I'm sure this will hit home with you.\n",
        "\nIn the vacant and easily forgotten world of television the most compelling trope is by far when a program \u2018jumps the shark\u2019. This involves making an attempt to re-frame the long-running popularity of a series with modern tonality and hails the coming decline of quality. The most clear example is The Simpsons. This is applicable to just about any form of media where continuity is expected, and no greater thirst for continuity exists than in the world of heavy metal where the divide between critical reception and sales is often surprising. What sells best is obvious, brand familiarity, and second is the band\u2019s ability to create hooks and emotional connection. Where familiarity (read: nostalgia) collides with emotional connection is when the expected becomes self-parody and the songwriter is no longer sure where to make a connection with their expectant, tedious audience.\n\nI believe this was the great mountain to climb in the early talks of resurrecting unanimously hailed Swedish melodic death metal progenitors At the Gates. If you came to virility in the 90\u2019s and remain rooted in those sensibilities, avoiding trend and cliches further, it might not completely sink in that At the Gates played a serious role in shaping the world\u2019s approach to playing the guitar with as much influence as Jeff Hanneman or Tony Iommi condensed into fewer decades. \u2018Slaughter of the Soul\u2019 in particular is the culprit that expanded the minds of musicians responsible for wave after wave of melodic death metal, melodic black metal, melodic metalcore, modern thrash metal, and served as the ultimate punctuation for their career. The dead artist appears most profound and legendary for the discovery-bound listener and At the Gates\u2018 end elevated their status.\n\nWith fifteen years off amidst nigh constant pleas for more, despite much greater success in other projects, the band reformed with intent to record an album around 2010. It was an exceptional album that saw Anders Bj\u00f6rler reclaim his guitar god status with songwriting that avoided parody on an almost self-conscious level with some of his most expressive and monstrous guitar work to date. Of course it was the band\u2019s return but Bj\u00f6rler\u2018s writing is what carried the thread from \u2018Slaughter of the Soul\u2019 into a modern melodic death metal record that still sounded like At the Gates but did not pander it\u2019s references into parody. I would strongly suggest that without Anders\u2019 careful ear the guitar work on \u2018To Drink From the Night Itself\u2019 is so self-referential throughout that parody has unfortunately been achieved despite divergent song structure.\n\nLike so many others who thrived and developed within the extreme metal cacophony of the 90\u2019s At the Gates wasn\u2019t an eventual buzzword for a teenage MySpace profile but rather an important shock-wave in the Swedish metal scene that helped popularized an underground extreme metal movement on the level of the NWOBHM. So, with decades to explore, re-evaluate, and analyze the band\u2019s output across five years and six major releases the consensus in hindsight is quite publically that \u2018Terminal Spirit Disease\u2019 was an impetus for the more grand explosion of melodic death metal. Whether or not you agree with that statement, it was a major label release that garnered ridiculous amount of praise and likewise it was a point of regret for the musicians involved in terms of artistry and being funneled down the record industry grinder.\n\nThe great pandering disturbance of \u2018To Drink From the Night Itself\u2019 comes with the first three notes of the title track. If you don\u2019t recognize that riff they\u2019ve already published by all means return to the greater joy, heaviness, and refinement of their previous discography. In place of intelligent structure are collages of \u2018filler\u2019 guitar work draped over re-imagined riffs of the past. \u2018To Drink From the Night Itself\u2019 isn\u2019t necessarily a greatest hits rehashed but Jonas Bj\u00f6rler\u2018s writing always benefits strongly from his brother\u2019s input. All is not lost without Anders but there is a certain lack of detail and structure that is a huge part of At the Gates signature beyond their sound. The sound is a no-brainer and something that only this band can nail despite so many imitations existing. In this sense the album sounds perfectly like At the Gates but has sixty percent of the substantive elegance.\n\nThe production and performances are some amount of savoir for the lacking guitar compositions, though. Each member, old and new, comes with a resume a mile long and a concurrent project of equal interest. Even if \u201cDaggers of a Black Haze\u201d, \u201cIn Death They Shall Burn\u201d and the title track too closely revisit old songwriting the experience is appropriate in it\u2019s regal, melodramatic sourness that only the Swedish can achieve with such convincing performance. The riffs are huge, dramatic, and have some of the same chaos magic that made \u2018At War With Reality\u2019 a special record in 2014. In mulling over \u2018To Drink From the Night Itself\u2019 I found myself twisted within mental gymnastics of optimism, disgust, adoration, and ultimately defeat. For every positive, nourishing drop I can squeeze from the turnip it is still a drink of slightly bitter vegetable juice. Though I enjoyed the full listen several times, and I\u2019m generally impressed with the experience, it is too self-referential. I think it is pronounced in a way that might have worked for Mot\u00f6rhead because of constant iteration but doesn\u2019t work for such a calculated discography.\n\nI think longtime fans will be pleased with some casual absorption of this record. Nostalgia is bristling and fun initially but I think if you were impressed with the differentiating aspects of \u2018At War With Reality\u2019 this will feel like an odd shift in focus towards crowd-pleasing art rather than a greater vision beyond reputation. The greater oeuvre and detail of the hallowed discography is missing and I guarantee you will feel it once the adrenaline wears off. With more time to bake and perhaps some greater chances taken \u2018To Drink From the Night Itself\u2019 could have been an interesting and weird entry, instead At the Gates merely microwaves the freezer-burnt leftovers from \u2018Terminal Spirit Disease\u2019. The only connection it can hope to make is nostalgia. \n\nAttribution: https://grizzlybutts.com/2018/05/23/at-the-gates-to-drink-from-the-night-itself-2018-review/\n",
        "\nIt's been about 25 years since the epic 'Slaughter of the Soul' was released. I discovered this great record in 2008, so for me it's more of a 10th anniversary. Nonetheless, every record At The Gates has or will ever release will ultimately be compared to SOTS, for many such as I.\n\nThat is the reference point from which I write this review. The band has changed and evolved since SOTS. Tomas's voice is rougher and darker now than the enunciated shouting style used in the 90's. The lyrics and themes are now much more symbolic and poetic than the direct style used before. Thus, At the Gates has a different style and approach than they had used in their heyday.\n\nI did like At War With Reality, but at the same time it had a mechanical feel to it that disappointed me a little. That feeling is gone with 'To Drink', because it is a better spiritual heir to SOTS. The despair-laden tone and melody is present again in a big way. And I love the usage of classical music to open and close the record. The closing track 'The Mirror Black' somewhat abruptly drifts into dark melodic classical playing and it's a great ending. It kind of uncovers the recipe of current At The Gates music - that the dark, well-constructed melodies are the cornerstone of their music. Tomas' style fits this purpose wonderfully, and the drumming perfectly frames the dark orchestral achievement created by the dual guitars and ominous bass tones.\n\nThis could get a higher score if I did not hold SOTS in such high regard - even to this day it pains me if real life requires me to interrupt the music and hit the pause button. That's not quite the case with this record - but you won't be hitting the skip button either, it's a consistent record.\n",
        "\nAfter four years of waiting, At The Gates gives us they're sequence to At War With Reality. With absolute astonishing playing, singing \u2013 I mean screaming \u2013, songwriting and producing, To Drink from the Night Itself shows a band that has grown as individual musicians and as a whole group as well. 12 epic songs made this album one of they're best and, of course, made worth those four years of waiting.\n\nThe intro track, so epic, warns you that what's coming on next will push you off the chair, and that's so damn right! The second track brings a hellmade powerful as could be melodeath beat and riffage in the typical At The Gates' style. As it goes, you notice that the album sounds similar to it's previous, At War With Reality, due to it's melodeath oriented guitar playing and arrangements, which is a great because that album is an incredible piece too!\n\nThe album goes on, bringing perfect balance between the brutal and the melodic. Each musician has they're own singular show of talent! Bass sounds deep and elevates the band's heaviness to absurd levels. Drums sound perfect, and with \"perfect\" I mean \"FUCKING PERFECT\"! Adrian's snare sounds like a rifle, I mean I never heard nothing so perfect coming from a drumkit!\n\nIn this album we have some guitar solos, which are not much common on At The Gates' songs, and I wanna make a special praise to the one from the song \"Daggers of Black Haze\": the groove beat asked for a melodic solo, and that's what was delivered to us! With few notes and soulful phrasing, with no shredding bullshit, that's a freaking beautiful guitar solo indeed!\n\nWith it's almost psychedelic atmosphere and tons of metal, this album brings comfort and rage sensations at the same time, a true evidence that fine art is not opposed to violent music. For sure it's my favourite album by them ever! Thank you, At The Gates, for this great work!\n",
        "\nI never was a fan of At The Gates; I frequently caught ear of their name throughout the years by many people but I never bothered to give their material a chance. I was gifted a promo of To Drink from The Night Itself  and thought to myself \u2018why not?\u2019. I needed to take a break from the barbarism of the upcoming Temple Nightside album (in which I'm addicted to at the moment) so this served as a sedative. \n\nTo Drink from The Night Itself  is a well compact album that spans 44 minutes in length. It has moments that feel thrashy and aggressive, whilst some sound melancholic/despondent. The self-titled track is an awesome starter, its main riff is catchy and supported by fast thrash metal drumming. It's one of the more candid tracks on the album when addressing the structure. There is something I picked up on quickly during my time spent headbanging to and examining the music; the first 3 songs sound almost identical to each other, they seemed to be builds of the primary riff of the self-titled track. Its as if they were initially 1 track that was designed based on 1 conceptual guitar riff. That riff raises its head during the beginning of each of the songs then passively submerges itself below the melody. \u201cDaggers of Black Haze\u201d has a saddening tone which I hated. That melancholy continuous into the following 3 tracks. They definitely have that \u201cdsbm\u201d guitar vibe, but there's also an aggressive side showcased in the verses which I was happy for. The tone is shifted more towards anger when \u201cLabyrinth of Tombs\u201d makes its appearance. The guitars sound more foreboding and seem to be borrowing influences of blackened melodic death metal for the solo and lead riff. \n\nAll of the songs featured on To Drink from The Night Itself  are moderately fast and rarely go past the 4-minute mark. The best highlights for me are \u201cIn Death They Shall Burn\u201d and \u201cTo Drink From The Night Itself\u201d. For those interested in the production; it sounds clear enough but has a bit of a haze over it. The volume seemed to have fluctuated on one instance but remained well leveled prior to and after the encounter. These negative properties of the production dissipate as the music plays on therefore becoming less of an issue due to the enjoyable tunes. \n\nTo Drink from The Night Itself  is a conventional album throughout its spin. I still have the melody of the self-titled stuck in my mind. If I enjoyed it despite the grieving moments, then I suppose fans of the band and genre will too.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates is a melodic death metal band based out of Gothenburg, Sweden. Consisting of Tomas Lindberg (Vocals), Anders Bjoler (Guitar), Martin Larsson (Guitar), Jonas Bjoler (Bass), Adrian Erlandsson (Drums). \n\nAt the Gates make a triumphant return to the melodic death metal scene with a follow up to the band's massively successful 1995 Slaughter of The Soul. However heavy and masterfully written it may be, it fails to capture the magic and pure melodic death metal sounds of its predecessor. \n\nAt War with Reality starts off excellent with the title track, it sounds as if the band has found their sound they left with, before they went on a hiatus. The guitars shred your face off, The drumming is constantly pounding in your head, Put that alongside Tomas\u2019s vocals and you have one hell of a metal track. Other stand out tracks include Order from Chaos and The Head of The Hydra. Overall the tracks work well with flow of the album and manage to capture that raw rage that At The Gates is well known for, Also working in the bands favour is the fact that the lyrics are very well written and add that extra layer that manages to create something truly memorable. However great the album is, It does have a few tracks such as Heroes and Tombs and City of Mirrors that fail to live up to the expectation. These songs just don\u2019t feel as if they fit in with At War With Reality's ebb and flow. I found the speed of the guitarists doesn't always match the fast tempo set by the drums. Therefore, throwing off the vocals and knocking the album down a peg. \n\nEven with those tracks, At War with Reality is still a classic Gothenburg metal album, Which is great thing if you know the bands that come out of Gothenburg, if not I will give you a few examples. Dark Tranquility, In Flames, The Haunted, Arch Enemy and Amon Amarth. In conclusion, At War with Reality proves that At the Gates can still play heavy, hard and angry. The old dudes still got it. I would recommend this album to any old At The Gates fan, as well as to any fan that enjoys metal.\n",

Consisting of Tomas Lindberg(Vocals), Anders Bjoler(Guitar), Martin Larsson(Guitar), Jonas Bjoler(Bass), Adrian Erlandsson(Drums). \n\nSlaughter of the Soul is masterfully crafted in design, both technically and lyrically, And through sheer talent At The Gates managed to create, or at least contribute to a new genre of music, melodic metal core. A hybrid of melodic death metal fused with elements of metal core, Without this album, bands such as Avenged Sevenfold, Killswitch Engage as well as Unearth and many more simply would not exist today if not for Slaughter of the Soul. \n\nSlaughter Of The Soul is fantastic from start to finish and does not let off the throttle.

Blinded By Fear, Slaughter Of The Soul, Under A Serpent Sun and Cold are some of the stand out tracks from the album. The album has also managed to stand the test of time and is amazing even in to date. Without giving too much of the album away I do wish to tell you about two of the tracks off this album, Blinded By Fear and the title track Slaughter Of The Soul. \n\nBlinded By Fear starts off incredibly fast and doesn\u2019t slow down. Anders Bjoler and Martin Larssons work on the guitars make it impossible for you to not bang your head to. With the blistering fast pace tempo they set, It is quite impressive that Adrian Erlandsson is able to keep up the pace and blast away. Last but not least you have to admire how remarkable Tomas Lindberg\u2019s screaming is, He makes you feel the rage in his voice and makes you want to scream alongside him, while making it sound majestic as hell. Slaughter Of The Soul is a whole other beast to tackle. While the track does have a similar style to Blinded By Fear it varies enough to make it truly remarkable and stand out, which is exactly what you expect from the title track. Unlike Blinded By Fear where you feel synonymous with the fast paced drumming and the rhythm of the guitarists it\u2019s the vocals that truly stand out. The screaming is at another level, Its so raw and anger filled, yet at the same time its graceful and poetic. It\u2019s a hard feeling to explain, which is why I recommend you listen to it yourself. \n\nAt the end of the day Slaughter Of The Soul has everything a metal fan could desire. Amazing riffs, blistering solos, Pounding drums as well as screams to scare everyone on your block. If you have been living under a rock and haven\u2019t heard this album I desperately urge you to give it a listen. It is widely regarded as one of the best albums out of any genre of music ever produced, It deserves that honor because every track is perfect. All in all, I would highly suggest listening to Slaughter Of The Soul.\n",
        "\nThe first single released from their new album, from which this is the title track, \"To Drink From The Night Itself\" marks the return of At The Gates! Not nearly as long as a wait than what we've endured previously, but a wait nonetheless! \n\nThe intro/chorus riff is quite similar to \"Blinded By Fear,\" off of their seminal release, \"Slaughter of The Soul.\" I wouldn't call it a complete rip-off, but it's eerily close. Still, very catchy and very heavy (much like Blinded By Fear). I'm especially fond of the riff that's directly after that, which kicks in firstly at 25 seconds; extremely chunky. There's a nice little drum solo at a minute and 30 seconds, which provides for a nice transition. The slower, double bass drum beat during the outro is a good rhythm change-up, and a fine way to wrap up the song. I would have welcomed a guitar solo, but the song doesn't suffer hugely without one. I feel the production could be improved, as it sounds much too roomy. Not quite the punch I expect, production-wise, from a legendary band like ATG. I haven't been able to find any official lyrics, so I think we'll have to wait for the album release to see what's to offer on that front. Overall, a very straightforward, but solid, song. Nothing groundbreaking, nor mundane. I hope to see a bit more experimentation throughout the entirety of the album (which we've already gotten a taste of with the 3rd single, \"Daggers of Black Haze\"). If you like At the Gates, and especially Slaughter of Soul, then you'll enjoy this song; much like I did!\n",
        "\nThe most common criticism that I hear levied against \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" is that it is too simplistic, and that At The Gates had shed the progressive tendencies of their previous albums and trimmed the fat to produce a leaner, tighter album. And while it is true that it is certainly a simplified effort, it pays off wonderfully, and proves to be an exercise in precision and brutality.\n\nIt's tempting to lump \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" in with other seminal Gothenburg albums like In Flames' \"The Jester Race\" and Dark Tranquility's \"The Gallery\", but \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" is a wholly different beast. Instead of the elegant guitar harmonies of In Flames or the progressive tendencies of Dark Tranquility, At The Gates opts for a straightforward, thrashy onslaught, which proves brutally effective, with a fast, heavy riffing style. Tracks like \"Blinded By Fear\" and the title track display the band's aggressive energy at it's best, combining aggressive triplet riffs, melodic harmonized solos, and Tomas Lindberg's tormented shriek. Lindberg sounds like a man possessed, with his frantic howl bringing a sense of desperation and agony to the album, bringing the lyrics to life. The melodic ferocity of the album continues on tracks like the jagged, Slayer-esque \"Unto Others,\" and the crushing \"Cold,\" featuring a gorgeous guitar solo from King Diamond guitarist Andy Larocque.\n\nClean interludes within the songs come frequently, such as the spoken word section in the eerie, foreboding \"Under A Serpent Sun,\" and the aforementioned \"Unto Others.\" The songs tend to be fairly short, with none of the songs breaking the 4 minute mark. This formula largely holds up throughout the rest of the album, with several short interlude tracks, \"Into The Dead Sky\" and \"Flames Of The End,\" which provide a bit of respite when needed. The album boasts sharp, clear, production, with crushing guitar tone that lends itself to the breakneck speed and aggression of tracks like \"Suicide Nation\" and \"Nausea.\" The bass is...there, I think. It has very few moments of glory, such as the beginning of the third verse of \"Cold.\"\n\nIf you're looking for a concise, no-frills blast of melodeath, \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" is the album for you. It's an album that I always find myself coming back to, and one that changed the landscape of metal.\n",
        "\nEasily my favorite At The Gates release, Gardens/Embrace is a grainy, snuffy snapshot of the days when Tompa drew logos for death metal bands that would turn into black metal bands. Before he'd go plum nuts and slaughter all souls with terminal spirit disease (I'd love to say At The Gates as a whole but between the two bands only one member is shared). Re-listening to these for my review, I realized that I really want both a time machine and a cloning machine, so I can go back in time and clone Tomas Lindberg so he can do both of them at the same time. Heheh hey Butthead, you said do both of them at the same time. \n\nGardens of Grief is the more sophisticated of the two, eschewing the satanist approach for, well, whatever it is At The Gates were talking about on those first couple of At The Gates albums. Which isn't to say this is anything clean sounding at all. We are still worlds (within us) away from the custom Bjoler cabinet riffage to come. If you loved the production of The Red In The Sky is Ours, you'll love this. The songwriting as well, the band's namesake song is a wonderful suite of tremolo riffs and even a sense of melodic advancement beyond what Entombed, Tiamat and Paradise Lost were unleashing. Perhaps this what the early fans of so called melodic death metal raved about with the genre. Granted they'd still be wrong, but I can clearly see a difference in the riffing style here and say, Cause of Death. I will say there is a little bit of difficulty on Adrian's part when it comes to hitting the snare on the super-fast blast beats. It sounds like fast kick drum intro rather than a blistering death metal massacre.\n\nThe main attraction of Gardens of Grief is old staple All Life Ends. Very much like the song At The Gates, this song is a salad of riffs and tempo changes, almost too many of them. The thing about these old songs is they will not get instantly stuck in your head like the Slaughter of the Soul songs. It may take several listens before you figure out which song is which. I won't go so far as to say the songs feel interchangeable, but it's leaning that way. \n\nThen we have In The Embrace of Evil, that mysterious basement filled with human bones about ankle high. There is blackened death metal, and then there is Grotesque. For a bunch of pimply faced teenagers these guys were super ahead of their time. Not to mention the fact that most so called blackened death metal bands got the idea completely wrong and were never able to come close to this. What's particularly impressive is even the \"reunion\" songs, Ripped From the Cross and Church of the Pentagram remain true to the band's original spirit. Say what you will about Tomas going for a more simplistic approach with Slaughter of the Soul, coming back to this, he and the other remaining members still remembered what made Grotesque tick and didn't infuse any outside influences to it. Tomas understands death metal, or at what Grotesque's role in it should be. The production is just a pinch slicker, but it still sounds like Leprosy compared to Sound of Perseverance.\n\nIf you're a fan of Swedish death metal, there's no reason for you not to pick this split up. Whatever format you find it on, if it has both releases on the plastic its pressed into, get it!\n",
        "\nLet me just put it out there that I hate melodic death metal. This album, Heartwork and The Final Chapter were the only albums of this subgenre that were ever any good. I asked a music teacher what exactly defines \"melodic\" and his response was that a melody is just a series of notes, nothing more, nothing less. So the opening riff of Beneath The Remains is just as much a melody as the breakdown in Master of Puppets. One just might be considerably less singable than the other.\n\nStrictly as a death metal album, Slaughter of the Soul is a failure. The lyrics are devoid of anything to do with death or morbidity, choosing to go for a more punk rock Van Morrison approach to lyricism. Granted, At The Gates' lyrics were always like this, but I can at least see where The Red/Burning Darkness fans were coming from when they say the band was a death-to-black metal transition waiting to happen. I also understand that like fellow 90s \"revolutionaries\" Pantera, this album would influence metal in all exactly the wrong ways, from the butchered Maiden harmonics to the puzzling drops in intensity to ballad like moments ala Master of Puppets. Even the vocals, which are mere hardcore/thrash raspy screeches, feel like they're subliminally telling weaker minded listeners to don basketball jerseys, get tribal tattoos and try to pass of fisticuffs as a form of dancing. Not to mention all the idiots who misinterpreted this album's thrash sensibilities (and yes they are there) as the way of the future. Killswitch Engange, The Haunted, Trivium and a whole hoist of other melodic paint chip fiends are the toxic waste mutant children of this album.\n\nWith all that being said, I can't call this album anything less than a classic. The songs are just too fucking good. Blinded By Fear, Need, World of Lies, Suicide Nation and the suicidal final art that is the anthemic title track are all brilliant slams of short and sweet punk-fused heavy fucking metal. Plus that production; that immense killer guitar tone. Like Slayer before them, the songs from the first two ATG albums might be better, but if they sounded this good and threw whatever atmospheric sensibilities to the wind those albums would be much more popular among extreme metal fans.\n\nThe flaws on this album are mostly what you've already heard. The interludes are pointless and slow the album's momentum down in it's tracks, and the riffs start to bleed together near the album's short running time. Plus, did we really that silly alternative breakdown in the middle of Cold, especially before a brilliant guest guitar solo from Andy LaRoque? For shame.\n\nThe best way to approach this album is not as death metal, or thrash, but crossover. I mean Lord knows it's practically what the Bjolers were trying to accomplish anyway, and it certainly succeeded in that goal considering the surprisingly wide appeal Slaughter of the Soul has gained over its two-decades-plus lifespan. Newcomers to death metal should definitely hold off on this one until they have a firmer grasp on the sub-genre and it's functional components, but if you want a kickass jogging mixtape, give it a whirl under the serpent sun.\n",
        "\nPeople either love or hate this At the Gates album, I feel that it is greatly underrated and often blamed for the fact that the band broke up. They split up because they believed that they had reached their peak and wanted to leave on a high note. I believe that they were right in doing so because this is their high note. It is an amazing album. A lot of people say: \"Well, even if they were at their peak why would they break up?\" This is kind of a stupid question, in my opinion. It is just like sports idols who quit playing when they reach their peak so they can end their career with a good reputation. Often, that works, but unfortunately for At the Gates this approach completely backfired in some ways.\n\nSome people agree that they broke up at their peak, while others think that they turned mainstream. Just because an album is popular does not mean it is bad. There are so many bands that have popular albums that are good. Many complaints about this album is the lyrical content and that it is either too depressing or boring. Life is depressing and most of the best music is fueled by pain. In the song \"Cold\" one phrase is \"Only the dead are smiling\" and \"To rid the earth of filth.\" The lyrics for the whole album, although they deal with dark topics like suicide and death, are clever and meaningful.\n\nThe riffs are catchy as hell and will leave you with the incessant urge to mosh long after the album is finished. A criticism that many people have is that none of the songs are over four minutes long. I definitely can see where they are coming from and for someone's favorite track it might be nice to be a little longer, but it doesn't really bug me that much. Even though the songs are shorter than normal for a metal band, listening to this album is a journey with changing emotional tones and topics. \"Into the Dead Sky\" is a great example of an emotional switch in this album even though it is an instrumental. It does not feel like a filler song. The guitars are haunting and it, in general, is a sorrowful song. You can get a lot of meaning from it even with no lyrics. I know there are more instrumentals like that out there, but most of the time tracks like that seem to be greatly lacking. Just from the title \"Into the Dead Sky\" you could interpret it different ways. Like how when you die people say you go to the afterlife, but what if it is just into the dead sky? \n\nMy two favorite tracks on this album definitely have to be \"Cold\" and \"World of Lies.\" The instruments in these songs work together beautifully and compliment the vocals, as well as the lyrical topics being dark, yet important. You can get a lot of meaning out of just a song title before you even get the chance to listen to it. As I have said before, people either love or hate this album. It should be approached with an open mind and if you do hate it write a review why. The worst is when people say they hate something just because. If someone writes a review stating why they aren't a fan of it for more reasons than just, well after it was released the band broke up, I'm sure many people would like to hear it. If you haven't heard it I definitely recommend checking it out.\n",
        "\nI used to stretch my brain as far as I could to try and imagine, even in the vaguest sense, what a \"perfect\" metal album would sound like. I did this off and on ever since I started listening to metal. It was normally an exercise in futility. When I first listened to this album, it actually confused me. As naive as I was, it seemed to impress me in a way that I couldn't digest. But even with such indigestion, I never stopped listening to the most infectious tracks, which for me were \"Within\" and \"Neverwhere\". It didn't take much aging for me to fully grasp how incredible this album was, and I only owe the perplexion to having not heard anything of the like at the time, other than early In Flames and Sacramentum.\n\nThe whole concept of melodeath is lost on many people. I believe this is because some of its progenitors, and much of its mimicry, had a common denominator of dry, uninspired scale-mongering. Not that this approach always had mediocre results, but more often than not, it seems to. This release takes that concept, and amalgamates melody and harmony with dissonance and free-form chaotic expression.\n\nI chose to mention \"Within\" because, out of all the tracks, it seems to be the most well orchestrated, as well as the most raw and unforgiving whirlwind of terror that could ever befall your ears. All the parts tell a story untold, until your most wicked imagination tells the story for you. Every revisit to that song introduces me to parts of my psyche I had recently overlooked.\n\n\"Neverwhere\" stood out to me due to the unrelentingly cold riff patterns. It seems to me that when people try as hard as they can to reach the next extreme of extreme music, they fail to notice that there is still uncharted terrain in Western scales and ways to manipulate them with typical rock instruments. Metal seems to get more diverse all the time, but such disturbingly menacing riffs get less common as it diversifies.\n\nThe entire album is a journey that you get something out of every time you listen to it, and I will always consider this the definitive metal album that is equally as crushing as it is mellifluous. An album that uses the buzzsaw tone to its full potential. If you've heard bands like In Flames, Soilwork, Opeth, and even bands like Necrophagist, Obscura, and Beyond Creation, but have yet to hear this album, you have truly \"missed the point,\" and need to hear how torrential and maddening death metal's more eloquent side can get.\n",
        "\nHating this album because of what came after is a bit like hating Hitler's mum for reproducing - a little stupid when one regards the implications of that statement. How were At the Gates to know what 'Slaughter of the Soul' would spark? Did At the Gates plan a grand sabotage of heavy metal with this album? Of course not, because 'Slaughter of the Soul' was the album that broke At the Gates up. This album killed the band because it was popular, there was a resultant demand for the Swedes to tour and release more quality material, which our man Anders Bj\u00f6rler decided was too much to handle, fissuring the group and leading to their demise.\n\nWhat remains for us to do is listen to this album and enjoy it. I say enjoy it, since there is almost no doubt that a lover of heavy metal should find something to enjoy on this album, and many metal lovers should also be utterly taken by what they hear. There are all kinds of ridiculous comments in the reviews below about MacDonalds and Coca Cola and being a \"bad influence\", but what makes this all of those things is simply that it exudes the sense of being the finished product, of achieving brand image before anyone else. And if you're still struggling for a word to use for something like that, it's \"classic\". This is a classic melodeath album, and a classic metal album, regardless of what people claim about the legacy due to the fact that it is more or less the blueprint of the genre. It may not be the first, it may not be the best, but this is the one you point to when someone asks you the question, \"What is melodic death metal?\" This is melodic death metal.\n\nThe second thing I would like to address is that this is a good melodeath album, perhaps even a great one. Yeah, 'Slaughter of the Soul' has really short, compact songs that play a little like pop singles if you're inclined to think of it that way, but, my fucking word, isn't it also a fantastic exercise in songwriting economy and precision playing? Stripped of the bloated grandeur and wayward ambition of the occasionally farcical classic metal or power metal or even thrash metal, At the Gates managed to capture death metal's spirit here because they allowed absolutely nothing to dilute the focus and strength of their brew - this is a razorblade held to the throat for a capacious 34 minutes. Not only the speed and fury of the songs, but also the viciousness of the guitar tone and the rattle and pound of the drums, make this as direct a route to musical release as you are ever likely to hear, the necessary wanderings of the instrumentals 'Into the Dead Sky' and 'The Flames of the End' the only exceptions, where we hypnotically contemplate the slow progress of a blood drop from the razor's edge.\n\nThe riffs are so streamlined and insistent that one looks not to death metal for their attack, but also to speed metal and thrash, while the hooks in the likes of 'World of Lies' (the opening riff, that huge chorus line) are brand new and nod to the groove scene so hard, it's a bonafide headbang. So rarely do we receive groove whiplash, it's worth taking note when we do. Nor is this merely an exercise in speed and fury and hooks, there are instances of every instrument contributing something worthwhile the mix, whether that be Adrian Erlandsson's astounding battery behind the kit or Anders Bj\u00f6rler's vital lead guitar that sears most of the songs despite being limited to 20 seconds apiece. Another guy who quite clearly shovelled his soul into this record is Tomas Lindberg, who sounds mad and twisted and straining for escape not only on the likes of the classic \"The face of all your fears\" from the now ubiquitous 'Blinded by Fear', but on most of the lyrics on this album. At times, the band moves as one, as with the quiet interlude of 'Cold', the monumental swell into the blazing solo, then the drop out of the guitars to leave just Jonas Bj\u00f6rler's bass gurgling on the blood in Lindberg's throat as he tears the line \"22 years of pain/And I can feel it closing in\" out of his body. And really, honestly, that's not the best song.\n\nHowever, there is a mild criticism one could level at 'Slaughter of the Soul', which is that it seems a little limited or narrow in its scope. In the context, one could go either way regarding this, since there is less divergence here than on the other Swedish melodeath releases of a similar time, though compared to the bands that 'Slaughter of the Soul' supposedly influenced, there is a marked effort not to become predictable or stagnant both within songs and over the album as a whole. The first and most important point on this score must be the song length and album length, since discounting the two instrumental tracks, this release does not even total half an hour, which is certainly not long enough to become stale. Besides that, the versatility of the instrumentalists in a song like 'Under a Serpent Sun' is remarkable: the opening glowering of guitar in the background could come from a Primordial album or an atmospheric black metal project; then the trademark hooky riffs and brutish drumming cut in; following the restrained lead, the guitars cut two separate shapes, quick and sharp plus deep and looming; finally, the unnerving clean section and tense outro are a fine example of how to slow a song without releasing any tension. That's the thing really: the whole album is performed with outstanding tension and intensity, except for the necessary interludes. Not predictable, not cliched, not the end of the line. Still a landmark.\n",
        "\nIf At the Gates' sophomore album were personified, it\u2019s would be feeling one thing and one thing only: an intense hatred for its elder brother, The Red in the Sky Is Ours. This thing was always going to be a scrutinised and troubled album, due to the endless comparisons that would arise from being that album's successor. The fact that this isn't trying to be something different altogether, with inherently different objectives (like Terminal Spirit Disease) doesn't help. This is clearly meant to be an album in the vein of their debut, and hence shall be measured as such. And I am pleased to say that this pretty much lives up to their fantastic debut.\n\nDo bear in mind that since The Red In the Sky Is Ours was perfect, that is quite the achievement. This isn't quite the same beast as their 1992 album, though the resemblance is clear, since the musical style is pretty much exactly the same: a Stockholm-informed variety of death metal, but with a notable shot of melody thrown into the proceedings. It is a more old-school take on the melodeath sound, especially in comparison to the likes of Skydancer or In Flames' 1993 demo tape. Those familiar with the more commercially notable and (in)famous albums of the style will probably find this a tad too abrasive and atonal, but those who like the classic Swedish sound will find much to like here.\n\nOne thing that this album possesses in spades is excellent performances, all around. Like I said about their debut, At the Gates were clearly a band that put the effort in (and look where it got them!), and this album is no exception. For one, Adrian Erlandsson is a fucking monster behind the kit! Like last time, he gives an incredibly varied, technically accomplished and frantic performance. Strings of double bass and more simple beats are interspersed with the tasteful usage of the blast beat and many, many fills. He has once again done what he mastered on the debut - used technicality as something to accentuate and bend an idea (making a fill *that* more complex), not take over the whole performance and become his only idea (endless wanking). He can blast with the best of them, but also keep a straight timekeeping beat when needed, and can vary the intensity to fit the atmosphere of that part of the song.\n\nAnd let us never forget the mastermind of these songs, the twisted geniuses that are Alf Svennson and Anders Bj\u00f6rler. Once again, their riffs are in plentiful supply, and also, pretty much all of them are an absolute pinnacle of the genre. They are a tad less sophisticated than what was present on the debut, but are more primal and aggressive as a result. The melodies here sound far darker and even more twisted than what was present before. Due to this, the album takes on a decidedly more unfriendly and stripped back tone, and despite being simplified, is far from conventional in the way Slaughter of the Soul is. Hell, even the bass has its moments. While it follows the guitars most of the time, doing a great job of providing a pronounced low end to the album, this album does have a few more bass breaks than its predecessor. That doesn't sound like a lot, and indeed Jonas' bass lines are nothing overly complex, but I am a sucker for an isolated bass guitar, hence more bass breaks is always a good thing (within reason).\n\nI am not sure what is more frantic and savage on this album, the riffs, the beats or those vocals. Holy shit, Tompa fuckin' outdid himself here! He continues with his slit-throat, savage death growls, only now they have taken on a 'shriek-y' quality. He genuinely sounds psychotic on this album, even more so than the tortured shouts/growls of The Red in the Sky is Ours. He also expands what he does somewhat, to mixed results. On the one hand, the distortion effects are kind of 'coreish' and unnecessary, but stuff like that dialogue and his shrieks in 'Ever-Opening Flower' are absolutely superb. This insane vocal style fits the twisted misanthropic lyrics very well, and really completes the album.\n\nSo far, this has largely been a rehash of what I said about The Red in the Sky is Ours. The band was clearly on their 'A' game with this one. However, differences start to arise with the song structures, and that is where the true appeal of this album for me (as well as one of its most off-putting characteristics) lies. Though these songs are exceptionally varied, to the point where it can match their debut, they are also extremely fragmented. The change-ups from section to section are far more jarring and stilted, lacking the natural, flowing grace of the debut. This leads to songs that are labyrinthine in nature, but also feel completely disorganised and chaotic.\n\nThere are other characteristics to this album that are questionable. One is that rather than having sections defined by little ideas, like juxtaposition of melody and atonality, or changing the atmosphere altogether, the songs are interspersed with random fills and short, squeaky solos, in an extremely haphazard fashion. They don't noodle for that long, but the continuity of the songs is completely thrown off because of it. Another aspect the album has lost is its subtlety and its dynamics. Barring short acoustic passages here and there (which are inserted at random into the songs too), this album is pretty much all guns blazing at mid to high tempo. There isn't really anything here like 'The Scar' or 'The Season to Come', only short, disorganised deathrashers like 'Beyond Good and Evil', 'The Architects' and 'Through the Red'. It is a far more primal and brutal album, trimmed of any real atmospherics or nuance.\n\nAnd as one last thing to put off any potential listeners, the production is really quite odd. The drums are fine (though the bass drums could be a bit louder) and the bass can be heard well. The mixing is good, nothing drowns anything else out, while giving a slight edge to the vocals. The guitar tone though... really is something else. It is really goddamn trebly, to the point where this album can get painful to listen to if played at a high volume. It is something that you must become accustomed to, else this album will not sit with you at all.\n\nAt this point, you may be asking yourself: 'So why the 100? It is all technicality and no actual substance, you hate that'. Well, you may have noticed that at no point while talking about the structure and the other sonic aspects of the album did I call any of it bad. This is because this album is literally one of the most insane, chaotic and disorganised things I have ever come across. Every song here is an anthem to cacophony, the sound of death metal at its combustion point of sheer rage and lunacy. These songs are murderous. The chaotic, stilted structures mean that you are always in suspense; you never see a change coming. You have no idea what comes next, and you want more. And as for the production? Eh, this thing gets you headbanging so hard with numbers like... all of them, with their maddeningly quick changes of pace and stripped down simplistic rawness that you just don't care about little things like bleeding ears.\n\nIf I may return to my personification analogy at the beginning, if this album and its predecessor came to life, then The Red in the Sky is Ours is teetering on insanity and the edge of reality. This album is on a sharp descent off of it, taking you down with it into its maze of torment. Listening to this may as well be worshiping at an altar to madness. I highly recommend this to any and all fans of death metal.\n",
        "\nNow, At the Gates have been discussed almost to death, but a lot of people still don't really know what to do with this album. Is it a dark cult gateway like their debut album? Is it a speed-hungry, stripped-down trip through hooks and riffs like their infamous 'Slaughter of the Soul'? The answer to both questions is \"certainly not\", though we are somewhat closer to the pure death and extreme influences of the earlier work. What puzzles me slightly is that there aren't a great deal of bands who have imitated this sound, despite the hundreds who have pilfered from the other releases. 'With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness' remains an oddity, a piece of the jigsaw that doesn't quite fit.\n\nFor me, that usually draws me towards music rather than pushing me away. I've had this album for a long time, perhaps 6 or 7 years, and I still don't feel like I've penetrated to its core and extracted all that it has to offer. The common complaint of this release seems to be that the songwriting is often messy and occasionally incoherent, which I agree with at least in part, since there aren't any of the popular song structures displayed on 'Slaughter of the Soul' and a lot of parts never repeat and are even prevented from developing by the swift changes thrown in. The melodic riffing style, created by the twin guitars of Anders Bj\u00f6rler and Alf Svensson, provides a lot of \"juice\", never drying out the album by dull plodding or furiously bland riffs, though they rarely prolong any particular section to memorable lengths, other than in the sombre trawl through 'Primal Breath'. What that means is that hooks and technicality must be meshed together into one chimera, which is notoriously tricky. While I don't think that At the Gates succeed with that here, we do end up with an album that throws constant surprises at the listener from start to finish, using a progressive approach to expand on the dark beauty of the previous album, even at the risk of that glowering power possessed by 'The Red in the Sky Is Ours'. 'With Fear...' ends up less instinctively brilliant, though equally as compelling and at least as dark, since the obscurity of some of the twists and turns in its songs create great gloomy gulphs and sinister precipices from which Tomas Lindberg ably torments the listener.\n\nThe production and mixing of the album are both major factors in its overall sound. The guitars are frighteningly trebly at times, meaning that listening at high volume for any length of time is a painful experience, even if it accentuates the dazzling light of the melodies and the sharp edge of the riffs. The guitars thus always remain in focus, with the percussion battling valiantly in competition for a similar space in the mix. Adrian Erlandsson gives a terrifically nuanced performance on the drums, playing not only the more traditional death parts with furious aplomb, but also mastering the head-spinning time changes in 'The Architects' and ensuring that the stop/start nature of the song doesn't wear too thin. The bottom end of the sound is surprisingly full for all that, including a gut-level punch from the dueling guitars, although Jonas Bj\u00f6rler doesn't peer through the mud too often. With all these busy elements fighting for prominence, Lindberg does well to fit his vocals into the gaps in the songs, especially since there are many odd shapes between riffs and brisk shifts between sections that could result in hazard. His scream is visceral and brutal, yet never descends lower than the guitars, actually roaring at a higher pitch than almost any death metal vocalist you would care to mention from 1993, which gives the songs a more desperate quality than sinister, so that when he screams out in 'The Break of Autumn' \"silent explosions in my universe of pain\", one doesn't dare question its sincerity or poetry. The lyrics, too, are anything but straightforward, dipping a toe into the natural pool of Amorphis while imbuing those peaceful images with a sense of chaos and unrest.\n\nListening to this album as a whole is admittedly quite a tiring experience, since the sharpness of the guitars, the harshness of Lindberg's voice, and the jagged song structures all take concentration and endurance to follow for 45 minutes. That said, the quality doesn't drop a great deal during the album's length, resulting in few disappointments in individual songs. 'The Architects' doesn't totally satisfy, largely because it gets a little trapped in its own technical web, while 'Blood of the Sunsets' doesn't quite have the atmosphere or the riffs to equal the other efforts. 'Ever-Opening Flower', despite an oddly hopeful name, dwells in complete darkness, especially the venomous howls and doom-laden riff that splatter over the area between 1:30 and 2:00; 'The Break of Autumn' is similarly intense and dominated by a labyrinth of riffs; the real centrepiece, however, must be 'Primal Breath', which trills, chugs, and slashes through 7 minutes in a dominant display of non-lead melody and ingenious guitar interplay, also proving among the most memorable moments here. Nevertheless, for the full terrifying ride, it's best to hit play and see what happens to your mind. I wish you good luck.\n",
        "\nEarly At the Gates is a bit of a surprise to those familiar with the classic melodeath sound. In addition to representing an older take on the melodic death metal style, that being death metal with an undercurrent of melody (rather than the formula of \u2018Iron Maiden with growls\u2019) it defies the formulaic conventions of the genre that were hammered into place by the mid '90s works of the Gothenburg trinity. Rather than being an unabashedly linear affair, this is an absolute masterpiece of composition and songwriting, as well as possessing measured technicality and excellent performances all around.\n\nFor one, this is a band that clearly was not one to rest on their laurels. Every member here puts in a good to absolutely incredible performance here. Everyone concerned is clearly more than adept at their respective instrument, and they unleash their full potential here. Take for instance, the fucking maniacal tortured screams of Tomas Lindberg. He sounds like a complete lunatic, and their highly frantic and aggressive nature, in both the rapid fire delivery and sound, fits the bleak, nihilistic lyrics and the chaos of the instruments going on behind him perfectly. This chaos is not without merit either; Adrian Erlandsson is a monster behind the kit here. He realises the point of a blast beat - much like an explosion during a film. It is meant to be used in short bursts to emphasize that particular scene/part of the song, not used throughout the entire track (with few exceptions). He mixes up the usual death metal technique of blasting with several technically accomplished fills and unusual rhythms that never fail to add to the songs and give them a very odd feel.\n\nTruly though, the main reason for this album\u2019s success is the warped genius of Alf Svensson and Anders Bj\u00f6rler. In addition to the former's songwriting, their riffs are an absolute pinnacle of the genre. They are fairly orthodox and old school death metal riffs that have a very potent and unusual sense of melody, but techniques such as playing them backwards are also employed here. Songs stuffed to the gills with them, to the point where there is almost no repetition of riffs at all on this album, and they truly evoke a feeling of insanity; if music could be personified, this would literally be someone on the very edge of reality and sanity. It is difficult to convey into text, you just have to hear them to believe it - a good example is that high end riff four minutes into 'Night Comes, Blood Black'. Anders' twin brother and bassist Jonas has his moments, though he mostly follows the guitars and gives them some much needed low end.\n\nAnother critical aspect of this album is how measured the technicality is. Riffs may not be repeated all that much, but songs never lose focus or compromise atmosphere and flow in the name of cramming 50 riffs into every song. The drummer is technical, frantic and varied, but never once throws the arrangement and timing of the song off-kilter by sacrificing his most basic role as a time keeper, or works against the overall 'movement' of the songs or the riffs. This is a difficult balance to pull off when the songs are long, so when they are (relatively) short, some competent performers shoehorn in as many gratuitous solos and other ideas that don\u2019t fit as possible, but At the Gates here manage to avoid that pitfall. The album is so much better for it, and showcases a lot of musical maturity for such a new band; a vague pointer towards their future success.\n\nAlso of note is the number of musical devices the band has to hand here, and how effectively they are used to create differing sections within songs and used alongside each other in the same section to create contrast or an amplified effect. Take for instance, the droning riff at the beginning of 'Through Gardens of Grief' being juxtaposed with melodic passages that it alternates with. Another example is the sombre and calm violin that creates haunting and eerie melodies under the guitars at times, and its isolation in 'The Season to Come' to serve as contrast to the title track. The album possesses leagues of little ideas and patterns like this, and trying to list one fifth of them would quickly throw off this review. These small ideas define whole sections of songs, and create a set of highly labyrinthine and yet smoothly flowing compositions, a difficult balance to achieve.\n\nThe songs that are produced from this mastery of balance, songwriting and instrumentation are all classics. Whether it be the destructive, fleeting intensity of the title track, the more progressive and varied 7 minute 'Within', the lethal re-recording of 'City of Screaming Statues' from their less melodic (but equally incredible) Gardens of Grief demo or the deathly duo of 'Windows'/Claws of Laughter Dead', every song here is an absolute masterpiece in every respect. Never have I heard songs that are laced with such varied atmospheres, so much attention to construction and an overall sense of focus on the details as well as the big picture. \n\nAs stated at the beginning of the review, this is a particularly technical, progressive and yet primitive form of old school death metal, and a far cry from the melodic deathrash of Slaughter of the Soul. It possesses far more intelligence in its construction and execution, as well as a strictly non-linear approach to songwriting. It also has a sense of variety in its atmosphere. Using quiet sections like 'The Season to Come' or 'The Scar', the album invokes a particularly doom-laden atmosphere, along with droning and slower passages like those found in 'Windows' or 'Kingdom Gone'. This sense of nuance and finesse in peppering the album with atmospheric and sonic change-ups helps to separate it from its comparatively boring successors as a truly one of a kind beast, and essential listening to any fan of death metal.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates and Voivod are not really two bands I'd associate with one another whatsoever beyond the fact that they are both successful, both longstanding (more so in the case of the latter, who never took the near decade hiatus), and both able to tour much of the waking world and inspire much fan obsession. Speaking of which, when it comes to the Canadian half of this equation, I am guilty as fucking charged. At the Gates is a band I enjoyed through much of the 90s, but not to the rabid level that a lot of local New England metalcore aspirants and devotees ended up making entire careers out of thanks to a single groove and an exclamation of \"Go!\". Their reunion record, At War With Reality, was one I found to deserve neither the heavy accolades it got amongst some of the slavish press, nor the incessant negativity it inspired among those who seem to hate just about any band that ever made a name for itself among that terrifying crowd of Others beyond their Inner Circles. Like clockwork, people, I can't even make this shit up. At any rate, that disc just sounded to me like a band who wanted to play it relatively close to the hip, while exploring a fraction of the polish and maturity that might have transpired had they gone major label after Slaughter of the Soul; and to that extent, it was fine, I listened to it a few times and shelved it right next to Surgical Steel.\n\nTheir contribution to this split is unfortunately not exclusive. \"Language of the Dead\" is available on the bonus disc to At War With Reality, and it serves as a fairly loyal representation of their classic melodic Swedeath sound, hints of Dark Tranquility's morose melodic sensibility embodied in some pure Slaughter of the Soul pickings, the harmonies strong enough in listening but not very resonant once the smoke clears. Lindberg's vocals still have some bite to them, but they seem a little more phoned in, too 'level', lacking the uncouth emotional punch he once possessed in the band's heyday and thus occasionally smothered in the guitars. Though this is a solid tune, I can see why it was not part of the final selection for the full-length. The drums sound fine, the acoustic segue seems almost inevitable and doesn't really add much to the song except to reinforce the contrast such parts always created on their older recordings. The main issue for me is that it is ENTIRELY OUTCLASSED by its companion here...\n\nI can assume \"We Are Connected\" will not remain a staple of this 7\" either, likely to be released as a part of Voivod's forthcoming new full-length, but it is a fucking fantastic, upbeat track, with intricate Piggy-esque licks proving once again that Daniel Mongrain was the 'right guy for this job', adjoined to pumping bass-lines. Seriously, I was shocked to shit when I realized this wasn't actually Blacky playing the bass, but the Canadians' latest acquisition, countryman Dominique 'Rocky' Laroche, who is as much a mirror for his predecessor as Mongrain. This guy was hiding in a blues band? Welcome, my friend, come and drink the nano-water and stay a part of this well-oiled machinery forever, or at least until Blacky's next nostalgia trip. Say what you will about the album's title being a callback to the robotic voice in \"Killing Technology\", but this tune truly captures the essence of classics like Dimension Hatross and Nothingface in the contemporary flesh of Target Earth, and if it's a true indicator for the coming material then I am beyond stoked...fell in love with it the first time I heard it, and the courtship is still thriving.\n\nNow, as for the 'value' of this Century Media split on the whole...I can't really say. Once \"We Are Connected\" appears on a proper full-length, then this is almost entirely worthless spare the cool black & white artwork, which was done for both bands in the Voivod style. In fact, I almost wish At the Gates had written a new tune for this with a slightly more dissonant, outlandish Voivod influence, now that would have been something to make this special, especially if the Canadians had an exclusive original too. \"Language of the Dead\" just seems like a lazy choice, probably a label choice, and it just has nothing in common with apart from, you know, it being metal on the same label. So ultimately, I'm feeling really neutral on this, apart from the artwork, and can't really recommend that anyone do anything more than sample the songs online and acquire the respective full-length albums at your convenience if you enjoyed what you hear. But Side B Side A, all night, and all day.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI approached this album the same way (I assume) At the Gates approached writing it: with a little bit of caution. And mistrust as well. \n\nNot that I wasn't hopeful, excited or hyped. AtG have been one of my favorite bands for years now, and they blew me away when I saw them live for my first time during their reunion tour. Actually this is probably the main ground on which I based my initial reluctance: a band with such a history, that contributed to the establishment of one of the most recognizable and eclectic genres in metal, coming back with a new record after a long hiatus, and almost twenty years after their previous output, the groundbreaking, excellent Slaughter of the Soul. We've all witnessed too many half-assed, worthless comebacks by historic bands that decided to take a dump on their past relics, leaving us all with a mixed feeling of contempt and disillusion, not to be concerned about At War with Reality.\n\nRarely have I been happier to say that my misgivings were all utterly, undeservedly placed. At War with Reality is excellent. It won't establish new untrodden paths in the landscape of melodic death metal, it may not be as sensational and pioneering as The Red in the Sky is Ours, but let's give Caesar what belongs to Caesar and praise this album, because it deserves praise beyond all doubt.\n\nThe sound and the songwriting pick up exactly where the band left off with Slaughter of the Soul. A heavy sound, enhanced by a top notch production, welcomes us after a interesting intro track. In fact, At War with Reality kicks off with a blast, delivering a strong and fast-paced riff with one of the strongest tunes here, \"Death and the Labyrinth\". The band's sense for melody isn't missing either, with this track as well as the others incorporating amazing melodic intermezzos, as well as some quasi-contemplative and calm sections, that give a little respite from the full-blown and stone-crushing violence of the heavier passages. This shifts in style, however, are presented in a perfectly blended and balanced mixture, never sounding artificial or out of place. A lot like Yin and Yang, it seems as if one couldn't be without the other, and that a drop of calmness must at all times be comprised in the ocean of overwhelming power, while on the other side of the coin, the stillness of the calmer bits always carries the foreboding of more violence to come. \n\nThe songwriting is seriously impressive. Changes in tempo are frequent and well played, the songs are never repetitive, each having a distinct feeling. This is accomplished in good part thanks to Lindberg's performance, which is amazing. He truly is a fantastic singer, and the feelings of anguish, fear and depression are transmitted in a bare, crude way, with an unprecedented level of conveyance. He manages to make you feel what the excellent lyrics he himself wrote really mean. I just got goosebumps by thinking of this right now, I'm not kidding. The musicianship of the Bj\u00f6rler twins as well as the other performers involved is great as we all remember it from the glory days of the band. In fact, it may have gotten better. Erlandsson's drumming is powerful and distinctive, Anders Bj\u00f6rler's playing is great, and his solos are melodic and tasteful as they've ever been.\n\nAnyone who likes melodic death metal should definitely buy this record. It shines new light on a band that seemed forever lost, and I now find myself hoping for more records in the future. After seeing them live a couple of months back I definitely can tell that these guys are bursting with energy and liveliness, as this very album is, but only time will tell what will happen, and if they'll get down to writing once more. For now I content myself with the glorious At War with Reality, and my now half restored faith in comebacks.\n\n\"We are a burning darkness\nSwamped by a thousand seas\nMute from fear, hollow and eternal\nWe sleep forever\nThe end goes on...\"\n",
        "\nMany reactivated legendary groups had members beating around the bush for years with projects that borrowed copious amounts of influence from their then-defunct bands\u2014Luc Lemay of Gorguts sticking to Gorguts-like music with that Negativa group he was a part of, or the Autopsy dudes screwing around in a number of similar death metal bands, for instance. There was a semblance of unfinished business; it made sense to have certain bands return. Others shouldn\u2019t have kicked the sleeping dog in the ribs, but hindsight is never 20/20. It all makes sense on paper: band X is excellent, so why not make a new album after Y amount of years? But suddenly that new album becomes a brown log floating among pristine rivers, and while some insist the turd-infested waters are certainly not turd-infested, you can\u2019t help but see them cringe. They know that buoyant tube is no Babe Ruth.\n\nTake, for instance, the tale of Duke Nukem Forever. Stuck in developmental hell for years, the fourth installment of the much-loved series was mired by updates and speculations that were aimless. Zero Punctuation mastermind Ben Croshaw created a wildly facetious video review of the game before its release to underscore the problems of Duke Nukem Forever seeing the light of day. He hilariously attested the game would fail to live up to expectations and subsequently poop the bath among its fan base due to the evolution of the gaming world\u2019s industry and technology. Long story short, he predicted Duke Nukem Forever to be like telling a kid with BPD to find a drum of gasoline and kill a few hours. As foretold, results weren\u2019t too hot. \n\nAt The Gates embodies the spirit of the ultimate sacred cow. From \u201cThe Red in the Sky is Ours\u201d to \u201cSlaughter of the Soul,\u201d each and every release they created holds prodigious worth to specific schools of thought within death metal. Purists consider \u201cThe Red in the Sky is Ours\u201d and \u201cWith Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness\u201d to be two of the few compositional zeniths of the sound (myself included), while \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d and \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d were pivotal in molding the melodic death metal identity, and helped inspire a new generation of bands. How many groups have had that degree of influence on such a vast magnitude? Very few come to mind. \n\nWhen At The Gates started touring again, the guys constantly shot down the idea of making a new album; they were cognizant of their legacy, and had no intention to tarnish it. The preserve-the-legacy thing was something to admire, really. One of my favorite bands, taking the high road; a clean slate, never to be ruined by that brown log floating in their pristine little pond. Much like the release of Duke Nukem Forever, I\u2019m left wondering why \u201cAt War with Reality\u201d exists. What else did At The Gates have left to prove, other than to make a new album just for the sake of making a new album? The whole idea just seemed redundant.\n\nFor one, the influence of \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d has been violated and bastardized by hundreds of bands since 1996. Any criteria At The Gates used from their most renowned album would come up lacking and bare; the well had been tapped long ago. The odd rhythms and complex structures of Alf Svensson\u2019s work in the band (jokingly referred to as \u2018Alf the Gates\u2019) were out of question, because (a) Svensson was not involved in At The Gates\u2019 resurgence, and (b) the other members wrote off most of his work, often calling his twisting compositions of the group\u2019s early era \u2018pretentious.\u2019 Also, members of At The Gates went on to form The Haunted, so there\u2019s strike number three. It smelled like they were doomed from the start to unleash a product of mediocrity, nothing close to their former glories. \n\nOn the other hand, if they released an album that kicked ass, I would have gladly ate my words. But it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case, because \u201cAt War with Reality\u201d is dull. Not a colossal turd, but it fails to conjure the sense of innovation and mastery that At The Gates\u2019 prior efforts captured effortlessly. It falls mostly under the blanket of The Haunted\u2019s straightforward style of melodic death metal with some parts that might have had a place on a trimmed version of \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d or \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease.\u201d As exciting as The Haunted, as insipid as The Haunted, and packed with a special fragrance that smells like The Haunted.\n\nMaybe an album like this would have worked back in the late 1990s when this sound was still developing. The melodic death metal identity has long since been ravished by countless projects, but \u201cAt War with Reality\u201d never got the memo; it kicks down the door to the party ten years too late. The integration of candid death/thrash metal riffs stripped out of The Haunted\u2019s modus operandi makes a startling amount of these tunes uneventful from start to finish. The fact that these straightforward, predictable sequences are not just plentiful but the spine of the album shows the creative ingenuity of prior At The Gates opuses squandered for a corner-cutting songwriting template of little interest. They don\u2019t bother to heave out a frenetic melodic death lashing like \u201cSuicide Nation\u201d or even a by-the-numbers replication of older days, but instead stick to bland mid-paced sections with bits of At The Gates-styled riffs and parts thrown in here and there. \u201cAt War with Reality\u201d shows this once-great band playing armchair quarterback. Woefully humdrum and creatively bankrupt.\n\nThe biggest letdown is that few sections appear that actually sound like At The Gates, oddly. Tomas Lindberg\u2019s barks, which thankfully have not changed one bit, appear to be the only part of At The Gates not to have its costs cut. \u201cDeath and the Labyrinth\u201d and the title track act as the leadoff tunes by setting the stage, but they completely fail to make an impression. The aggressive use of melodic death metal to kick things off is like a street magician pulling a quarter out of a middle-aged man\u2019s ear and expecting him to be amazed; these are second-rate copies of \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d glued to The Haunted\u2019s straightforward banality. I\u2019m being generous by calling them mediocre.\n\nThe whole record is almost entirely devoid of memorable riffs, save for a few up-tempo bits (especially \u201cEater of Gods\u201d) and a handful of mid-paced parts. I can\u2019t recall a fragment of \u201cThe Circular Ruins\u201d through \u201cOrder from Chaos\u201d without hearing the songs themselves; they have no gripping power whatsoever. The second half is a little more tolerable, because some of these tunes finally begin to wake up and shake off the cobwebs. \u201cEater of Gods,\u201d as mentioned, is a much-needed pocket of fire, and \u201cThe Book of Sand (The Abomination)\u201d sticks more to the melodic elements of prior At The Gates works than most of \u201cAt War with Reality.\u201d Sad part is, these songs are fine, not exceptional. The rest ranges from forgettable to boring with a common theme of the group sleepwalking through it all. \n\nBig publications may continue to brown-nose the band and the label, and apologists will call this turd they munch on through grimaces a Snickers bar, yet there is no denying \u201cAt War with Reality\u201d is nowhere near the prominence of the At The Gates moniker. I can\u2019t think of a worse fate \u201cAt War with Reality\u201d could have suffered than this phoned-in, lackluster snapshot of a legendary band clocking in and punching out as if this were a faceless day at the office. The world of melodic death metal the guys of At The Gates helped create has moved on. Only now, with the return of its master, they\u2019ve shown up a day late and a dollar short; this makes the harsh reality of reunions infinitely more convincing. A note to future legends: you have nothing left to prove. Stay dead, for Christ\u2019s sake.\n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\nThe return of formidable melodeath masters At the Gates was not without both fanfare and unsure demeanors. To be honest I was at first curious to know the how, why, and wherewithal that came with this sudden revival, but then the bitter reality of how big it all went down with some folks out there came to be and, therefore, new material to placate the desire for more Gatesian antics as well came to be. But whether or not this can be seen as a real return to form or a simple product to continue their latest upward trend of attention-seekingness is truly up to the listener's sense of cynicism or positivity.\n\nEvidently taking the years-long lessons of mid-paced pounding mixed with dark harmonies of their ashes-rising heir apparents The Haunted, \"At War with Reality\" offers a bit more than the subsequent revival act in terms of a more varied arrangement scheme and increase in melody and atmosphere yet retaining that same middle-of-the-road pacing, simpler variety and a rather milquetoast level of performance. Easily taking more cues from the straightforward thrashing of \"Slaughter of the Soul\" versus the unearthly delights of \"The Red in the Sky...\", there are occasions where the whole of the music sounds honed and more inspired than the rest of the song(s)/album itself, whether it be the tingly harmonies (\"City of Mirrors\"), thick-as-jungle-fog riffwork (\"The Book of Sand\") or occasional clean guitar sections that prove to be worth more weight than the heavier moments (\"Order from Chaos\" had that down as well as AtG could ever hope to achieve). These moments aren't as numerous as I feel they should have been, but even their minute amount was able to keep \"At War with Reality\" from being a complete bore. As well, the grungy production and unpolished guitar tone keeps this from being too modernized and product-like for its own good, thereby resulting in the band sounding like a real act versus a studio hack-job overediting every single track and bringing about a little more appreciation on my end, for rarely do you hear a post-millennial recording actually sound like a fucking album over something so post-produced perfect as to be unable to be replicated on stage. DragonForce this sure as shit ain't...\n\nBut that's not to say that this is, by any major stretch, the comeback album to outdo all other comeback albums. The main bulk of the album doesn't stray from the same mid-level tempo, rendering the material and performance sounding more fatigued than it really should; there are moments where it almost feels like each respective member recorded their parts after a late work shift and just didn't have the energy the songs desperately need(ed) to make them spectacular instead of \"meh\" (I found myself tapping my fingers more than a few times during \"Heroes and Tombs\", a track that really felt twice as long as it really is). I place most of the blame on that on the halfway-inspired songwriting and phoned-in drumming (which is a serious bummer seeing as I know how well Mr. Erlandsson can devastate the kit). And as iffy as I found the vocals (not quite sure whatto think of them, to be honest...), I did find them to be the most genuine of all the At the Gates folks by way of the amount of energy that went into the otherwise off-putting shouts/screams/what have you. If ever the album needed a real saving grace, that would have to be it, which certainly doesn't do the whole affair any major favors in the least. You want to be able to absorb the whole damn thing versus just one or two elements, which clearly did not happen here. But hey, too many years apart will do that to a band, I fear...\n\nIn the end \"At War...\" is, at best, 30% interesting ideas and 70% tired and dull plodding. Those expecting the second coming of \"Red Sky...\" or even \"With Fear...\" will walk away plenty disappointed, maybe even a bit pissed, so try not to place this on so high a pedestal. It's not completely worthless, but also not really a necessary listen given the talent involved. Worth a single listen, then you can judge it for its own merits afterwards.\n",
        "\nThey're back! That's right, after years of waiting, we finally have At The Gates' newest release: At War With Reality. Right off the bat, let me just say that every single year we've waited for this album was definitely worthwhile! The amount of brutal and melodic tracks on this installment definitely blew my hair back. At War With Reality definitely signifies the return of the melodic death metal pioneers without a doubt. It's clearly shown through perfect songwriting, beautiful solos, unforgettable riffs and that AtG feel we all know and love. Everything you've ever wanted out of this album is definitely all packed in here. Without further ado, let's dive in:\n\nYou'll notice immediately that the guitar work is on point. The quality is crisp and clean, high quality without a doubt. If you loved them on \"Slaughter of the Soul\" you'll definitely enjoy the ones being heard here. The solos are beautiful, melodic and fast when the time is right. When it comes to the riffs, they're heavy, way heavier than their previous releases. The drums match the rest of the band pretty well, they haven't really changed in terms of quality, speed and brutality which is an extremely good thing and also a relief. The biggest problem with most metal bands nowadays is that they tend to focus too much on experimentation rather than quality of the music to the point where the tunes get way too obscure for anyone to listen to. At The Gates did some experimentation here but in all the right places. They didn't fuck up like In Flames did with their new album called \"Siren Charms\" where the experimentation and new directions in style literally ruined the brutality and everything metal about the release. AtG basically decided to make their album a mixed bag, there's a good portion of both fast and slow songs which is something they normally don't do. They usually do one or the other, most of the time it's usually fast paced. Here, they did the best of both worlds and it shows that they're fully capable of pursuing new directions without messing it up. \n\nOn top of that, the lyrics are classic AtG and I'm really glad they didn't abandon that as well. I feel like they're the only death metal band that don't stick to the same schtick that most bands do, lyrically. Bands like Amon Amarth and Aborted stick to certain subjects and it gets tiring really fast whereas AtG write about various things and that makes every single song refreshing. The vocals are a bit dry and aged but honestly that makes no difference, they still sound good. It's pretty obvious that Tomas Lindberg has aged but that's all in the name of rock n' roll. Some would say this album is \"Slaughter Part II\" but honestly I feel like it's \"Slaughter\" with more power, more skill and they definitely put a lot of thought into this installment. Which means they weren't lazing around all these years.\n\nThis album is, without a doubt, album of the year 2014 in my books. At The Gates managed to stay with their roots while also experimenting with their sound without damaging the goods too much. They're the only band this year that has truly made an album that satisfied me to the fullest. They've succeeded where many bands failed to bring to the table, which is something new and innovative. I feel like I could listen to this album all the way through compared to releases by other bands where I get bored after a few tracks. You should definitely consider listening to this album, don't hesitate to do so either. Believe the hype, it's definitely all true. An Instant favourite.\n",
        "\nAfter an eleven year absence the melodic death metal greats At the Gates reformed in 2007 to play select festivals, but said that this reunion wouldn\u2019t result in a new album. But fast forward seven years and due to the response they\u2019ve gotten and the overwhelming demand, here we are with their fifth full length album At War With Reality. With a nineteen year gap since Slaughter of the Soul, and with the band members other releases in the intervening time having been of dubious quality at best, it was hard to get excited even from a band such as At the Gates. But any worries about how a new album would sound after nearly two decades were quickly allayed \u2013 this is classic At the Gates and it\u2019s as if they never left, combining all the sounds of their previous albums in one into another quality effort from the Swedes\n\nA spoken word intro in Spanish quickly gives way to the first proper track Death and the Labyrinth, and it\u2019s instantly recognizable as At the Gates. Those melancholic melodic riffs are reminiscent of their d\u00e9but, while the guitar tone seems to come from Slaughter of the Soul with the warm production of Terminal Spirit Disease all for good measure. Melodic riffs, aggressively harsh rasped screams and a great mid paced drum barrage, it really is as if they never left and it\u2019s a great one that could have gone on any of the albums before it. Each track on the album has it\u2019s own feel to it, with the title track\u2019s sound walking the tightrope between sombre and epic, with those minor scales reeking of despair, but the emotional guitar solos sound powerfully exciting. Melodic death metal often sounds far too sugary with a tame production, especially when it comes to solos, but At The Gates get it right, the solos here are always well crafted and energetic, rather than sounding like saccharine attempts to show off (as Arch Enemy do these days.)\n\nHeroes and Tombs shows great interplay between the two guitarists, with one playing deep murky riffs, the other dishing out the melody in a cleaner tone and both combining excellently with more vicious vocals from Tomas \u2013 I can\u2019t get over how great he sounds on this album, he\u2019s at this pissed off best. Those slow, murky riffs sound like filth and it\u2019s a good offset to the melodic approach of the other guitar. The Conspiracy of the Blind sounds like it could have come straight from Slaughter of the Soul with a thick caustic guitar sound and fast simple riffs amongst the memorable melodic touches and catchy vocals, while the exotic sounding intro to Order from Chaos opens up one of the more interesting tracks on the album, with acoustic guitar melodies combining well with more mid paced heavy riffage. Closer The Night Eternal is the album\u2019s longest, and the atmosphere generated through the sombre riffs and the effortless passages from one section to the next, especially the way it flows into that stunning solo at the end, make it a joy to listen to.\n\nThe best track of the bunch though is Circular Ruins, with Tomas sounding particularly vicious, screaming his lungs out intensely against a backdrop of ugly riffs with a deep rumbling guitar tone, with brilliant solos snaking their way around the fretboard and sticking in the mind. And there aren\u2019t any bad tracks on At War With Reality, each one having it\u2019s own identity, with memorable riffs, vocal lines and interesting ideas. That said, they come out strong, with the first three tracks being the best on the album, but the rest are by no means slouches and would each fit on any of the old At the Gates album with ease, but it does just feel perhaps a little too front loaded \u2013 but that\u2019s the only bad point on a great comeback.\n\nIn At War With Reality what At The Gates have done is not only produce an album that more than lives up to the name in a great release, they\u2019ve released one of the best albums in many years in a stagnant melodic death metal scene and it\u2019s a lesson to all the bands around them \u2013 this is how it\u2019s done!\n\nOriginally written for swirlsofnoise.com\n",
        "\nHere we finally have it, 19 years and we can wipe clean the dusty cobwebs of Slaughter of the Soul. At War With Reality showcases a band playing to their strengths of their whole career. I get both the feeling of nostalgia and a breath of fresh air with this album.\n\nI remember receiving a promo from a friend in '91 of the song \"At the Gates\" from the Gardens of Grief EP (only titled a promo at the time). Few songs have changed my views on music as much as that song. It obvious to say I was floored by what I heard. I waited with baited breath to hear more from this new band. I was fortunate to find a cassette copy of \"The Red in the Sky is Ours\" when it was licensed by Grindcore records to the United States in '92. The album has had a major role in my life and I feel I relate to that album more than the other At the Gates releases. The Red in the Sky is Ours is even one of my favorite productions even though most people and the band itself find it awful.\n\nFast forward twenty plus years and I am a bit hesitant to what I would hear from At the Gates in 2014. I felt like they could play it safe and go down the path of the more streamlined approach of Slaughter of the Soul. Well, I was dead wrong. I love Slaughter of the Soul but I really didn't want to hear it rehashed all over again. It is with great relief that they released a fantastic, fresh, and varied At the Gates album. \n\nThe production is top notch and the guitars razor sharp crunch is perfect for the mood here. For the first time Jonas' bass playing shines through the mix and plays a prominent role in the overall sound. Listen to the chorus on \"Death and the Labyrinth\" for some slithering bass lines. Back in the fold are the double guitar melodies tremolo picked at various speeds and paced to create that majestic signature At the Gates sound. The album both thrashes and creates a ominous wall of atmosphere. The drumless instrumental, \"City of Mirrors\", is both dark and carries a dense dirge like feeling. \n\nThe drums mostly plod along in the same fashion as Terminal and Slaughter, mostly mid-paced and precisely executed. I prefer the loose, unpredictable, and frantic drumming style of \"The Red in the Sky is Ours\" but that would no doubt sound out of place now. Tompa Lindberg delivers the goods both vocally and lyrically on this album. Easily his best performance since Slaughter. Back is his signature cutting rasp and he seems to fit only in the AtG setting. I don't particularly enjoy his vocals in other bands. On a similar note, I never liked The Haunted much either. The band members are back together where they belong.\n\nThe album version I hold here has two bonus tracks, \"The Language of the Dead\" and \"The Skin of a Fire\", that are placed in the second half of the album at track 9-10. I'm not sure if this is the way the album was initially intended to be released? Regardless, both tracks deserve to be heard as they are excellent and fit into the album as a whole. The approach of \"At War with Reality\" has a fresh sound while hinting and nodding to past releases and musical expressions. After all, this is their own original sound and this is what At the Gates were built on. They have refined their craft and foundation to perfection over these years. This is what I was hoping to hear as a fan of the band. I wasn't confident they had it in them after such a long layoff though. I am ecstatic to be proven wrong.\n",
        "\nI should preface this review with one thing: My feelings on At The Gates previous discography differ from the norm. I\u2019m neither one of the many that consider The Red In The Sky Is Ours their greatest (And sometimes, only good album), nor am I among the crowd that will swear by their would be swan song effort, Slaughter Of The Soul, as their magnum opus. I\u2019ve always found the albums sandwiched between to be the best representation of the iconic Swedish outfit. How is this relevant, you ask? The answer is clear upon a listen to At War With Reality, which plays out as a combination of elements from their preceding works. (In my opinion, the best combination possible) \n\nMelodeath legends At The Gates return after 19 years, with their first album since 1995\u2019s equally celebrated and maligned release, Slaughter Of The Soul. The album that was a landmark in the genre, but gave birth to many clich\u00e9s that some would say have plagued the metal genre for the past nearly two decades in their absence. The question I\u2019ve heard asked many times in regards to this new release is unable to be ignored: Can At The Gates\u2019 sound still come across as interesting or fresh awash in a sea of imitators?\n\nThe answer is a resounding yes. Rather than cash in on the legacy of the album and essentially clone it, ATG have seamlessly blended the hooky, catchiness of that album with the progressive elements on display on Terminal Spirit Disease, with the darkness of With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness, with the guitar work and flashes of aggressiveness reminiscent of The Red In The Sky Is Ours. \n\nThe guitar work is flawless, each riff, each note of every solo, seems as if it was masterfully crafted with attention to every finite detail. There\u2019s an inherent \u201cperfection\u201d on this album, in regards to the production, which, while somewhat taking away from the power of the riffs, allows for each and every carefully forged detail of the music to shine through. And unlike most very cleanly produced albums in the modern metal genre, the drums don\u2019t sound artificial or triggered in the slightest. This is modern production that doesn\u2019t reek of plasticity. \n\nThe most improved part of this album lies in the vocal work of Tomas Lindberg. I\u2019ve always had a love/hate relationship with his screechy, raspy, strangled mid range vocals. While at points they can lend a highly emotional tone to the music, other times they reek of amateurism on the band\u2019s previous releases. On At War With Reality, though, Lindberg is at his best. The rasps are slightly lower, and slightly less strangled, and all around, better. It lends the album much more replay value than previous albums, as it does not ever seem tiring or painful to listen to. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the lyrics being voiced are the best the band has ever done, which seem to be a more mature, thought provoking take on the \u201cExistential depression\u201d concepts on Slaughter Of The Soul. \n\nAll in all, the album is a perfect representation of the band\u2019s sound over the years, and a comeback record that more than holds it\u2019s own weight in the band\u2019s discography. Will it win back fans that have abandoned the band after their debut? Not likely. Will it have the same level of impact and legacy as it\u2019s predecessor? Not likely. But will any At The Gates fan who enjoys a majority of their work find it a solid listening experience? My take on this says yes.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m a bit of fanboy for oldschool melodic death metal bands. Dark Tranquility has been one of my favorite groups since high school. Short history lesson: every gothenburg, melodeath, and even metalcore band you have heard would not exist without At the Gates. These guys pretty much pioneered the style along with a few contemporaries that helped flesh it out after their dissolution. The Haunted carried the torch for a few albums with the remaining members and other groups like DT, In Flames, Soilwork, and Arch Enemy continued to utilize the same punchy alternation of rapid palm muting alternated with quick bursts of melodic hooks. \n\nUnfortunately, as is destined to happen with every new trend, a slew of copycats oversaturated the style, resulting in the creation of metalcore which suffered the same fate. All this to say, before you listen to this and think \u201cThey sound just like so and so,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ve heard this before,\u201d that\u2019s because they created the genre. With that out of the way, I will try my very best to judge this album on its own merits rather than engage in deity worship. \n\nWe begin with an odd little spoken word portion that feels like a nod to the far briefer sample from their seminal album, Slaughter of the Soul. From the get-go I hear an increased focus on melody here, which comes as little surprise given the developments in the style since the band has been out of commission. The production is obviously much cleaner which serves as both pro and con. The pro is that the instruments are well balanced without feeling over-compressed. The con is that it just doesn\u2019t have the same harsh feel as its predecessor. As for my impression of the opening tracks, I think they would have been better served leading with the strong titular track rather than the somewhat dull tremolo fest of \u201cDeath and the Labyrinth.\u201d\n\nAs I continue into the middle of the album, what does catch me off guard is the emphasis of slower tracks. Both At the Gates and The Haunted have always had a pretty high ratio of thrashy, face-melters to slow burners. Not the case here. The approach is almost 50/50, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. While the slower tracks strike me as not being all that memorable, they do serve to augment the impact of the faster tracks. A good example is the transition from \u201cHeroes and Tombs\u201d to \u201cThe Conspiracy of the Blind.\u201d The juxtaposition gets my blood pumping in just the right way. \n\nAnother compliment I have for the album as a whole is that it is brief and to the point. While many bands from the same period have opted to experiment with much longer tracks and implement new elements, ATG sticks to the formula. They give us a handful of songs, averaging around 3 minutes and the longest being 5:37, clocking in at a digestible 45 minutes. This is not to say that longer songs and albums are all bad. It\u2019s just that for this particular style, less tends to be more.\n\nSo, is there anything new happening here? Honestly, not really. If you came looking for innovation, you will be disappointed. However, ATG still does what they do better than any of the imitators. Charlie Chaplin once lost in a Charlie Chaplin lookalike contest. The same would not happen in an At the Gates cover band competition. These guys still write riffs that are killer in that they grab your attention and are pleasing to the ear. There are also several really nice solos that do not feel tacked on or overstay their welcome. Combined with the stellar interplay with the drumming, you will be bobbing your head to several of these tracks. Key offenders for me were the obvious title track as well as \u201cThe Book of Sand,\u201d \u201cUpon Pillars of Dust,\u201d and \u201cThe Head of the Hydra.\u201d The songwriting is kept fairly tight and there was not a moment where I felt bored and wanting to hit skip.\n\nTo sum up, At War with Reality is yet another strong return for a giant of the genre. The result here is similar to what Carcass have done with Surgical Steel. If you are a longtime fan or someone who just enjoys melodeath in general, you will dig this album. However, this album did not grip me from the offset as did some of the other major releases this year. Vader, Behemoth, and Septicflesh have put out albums that absolutely kicked my ass from the first listen. In comparison, this is pretty lukewarm. That being said, if you were thinking about buying the latest album from some fresh-faced imitator, please consider buying this instead.\n",
        "\nI interned at a college radio station in high school and it had a huge impact on my musical life because I got access to the station's musical archive as well as their discard bin. Into the discard bin went most of the extreme music promos as the station had no dedicated underground hardcore/punk/metal show at the time and I pilfered from that bin big time. One item I distinctly remember picking up was this Napalm Death/At The Gates split promo. I was already a big fan of Napalm Death but At The Gates were entirely new to me. At the time, this split had a big impact on me but that impact has lessened considerably with age. The distance of time and perpetual re-releasing of material by both bands has rendered most of the material on here inert.\n\nNapalm Death promo two songs off their Diatribes album coupled to two rarer b-sides. Like most of the music from this era in ND's history, the b-side material is far superior to the album cuts. \"Cursed To Crawl\" is one of the worst songs in N.D. history and an unfortunate choice to start things off here. I distinctly remember being unimpressed the first time I heard N.D. try and emulate bands like Helmet and Prong, complete with start-stop staccato riffing and slightly-filtered clean vocals. \"Take The Strain\" isn't much better, the Helmet influence is even more pronounced in the riffing, though Barney's gruff vocals are thankfully back out front cuz without them, you'd be hard pressed to even guess this is Napalm Death. \"Food Chains\" and \"Politics Of Common Sense\" are so much better. Both songs have that sickening lurch of the F.E.D. recordings complete with ugly guitar tone and harsh double-bass grooves more akin to Obituary. These songs definitely feel like pre-Diatribes recordings and were super-rare until the Noise For Music's Sake comp came out.\n\nAs for At The Gates, they were completely new to me at the time and my opinions coming out of my initial listens were totally uninformed, though I still think that gut reaction is credible. Not knowing the band's history, I felt like I was listening to an unfortunate Heartwork style Carcass clone. Tomas Lindberg's screeching scream-shouts did not appeal to me at all (and I still don't like his ATG style nearly as much as when he fronts grind or crust) and the slicker-than-slick production really turned me off. The two tracks from Slaughter Of The Soul had elements I could dig, particularly in the riffs, but mostly I was turned off by the vocals, very stock drums, and cheesy production. As with N.D., I much preferred the b-sides: \"Legion\" pummels more like Deicide and showcased deeper vox and more varied drumming. \"The Dying\" too is monstrous in the riff department but again I am turned off by the vocals and drums. ATG just didn't click with me and in the years since that has remained the case personally.\n\nI held on to this split for a long time but stopped playing it aside from those rare N.D. tracks. Now the disc is worthless as everything once exclusive to it has surfaced elsewhere. Had ATG really struck me, I might still be grateful for the introduction and in some ways I am given I have since enjoyed vocal work by Tomas Lindberg for Lock-Up and Skitsystem. \n\nNapalm Death: 56%\nAt The Gates: 43%\nOverall: 49.5% (rounded up)\n",
        "\nAt The Gates fans tend to fall into two categories: those who prefer their earlier, more progressive works exemplified by The Red In The Sky Is Ours, and those who prefer the simplistic, locked in groove of Slaughter of the Soul. Personally, I think both sides have their drawbacks although I generally prefer the earlier works. Although they are inconsistent and not well produced, it's better than the predictable verse-chorus stylings and teen angst lyrics on Slaughter of the Soul. \n\nTerminal Spirit Disease exists in a twilight between two polarizing eras - lacking the adventurous song structures of the Alf era, or the overt mainstream style of SoTS. Instead, we get songs that are longer and more complex than SoTS, but still in the same basic verse/chorus format. Although this guarantees that purists in both camps will find something to dislike about Terminal Spirit Disease (hence the generally low score), this is actually a fucking killer little album that does not get due recognition. \n\nThe album opens up with \"The Swarm\", a classic track that is a staple of ATG's live set even today. It seamlessly transitions from a melancholic cello introduction into a fluid guitar melody, then into a choppy verse and swinging chorus section. The guitar solo is nothing special - it's easy to see why At The Gates never really did much in this realm - but it's mercifully brief and doesn't really hurt the song's momentum too much.\n\nThe highlight of the album is \"Forever Blind\", a compact mini-epic where beautifully somber three guitar harmonies build into a searing, apocalyptic chorus section - accompanied by one of Tomas' strongest vocal performances. Even though the song is fairly conventional in structure, it conveys a feeling of violent, epic majesty like the best works from the Alf era, only simpler in scope. This song showcases the album's best overall feature; guitar melodies that simultaneously convey a feeling of sorrow and tense, urgent aggression. It's like the best moments of the first side of \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness\" condensed into a more easily digestible format.\n\nIt's not a perfect album - \"The Fevered Circle\" is a bit lazy, and the interlude is pretty but not overly substantial. The album ends on a high note with \"The Beautiful Wound\" though, with more of those gloomy yet raging guitar melodies.\nTacked on to the end are some live tracks that should please fans of the earlier Alf era - they are basically unchanged except for beefier guitar sound and a slightly faster tempo. I actually prefer \"The Burning Darkness\" to the album version - it's good to hear such a classic track unmarred by the bad guitar tone of that album.\n\nLike with most of the early At The Gates releases, the lyrics are among the best in metal; thoughtful and reflective, but with a healthy dose of pessimism. Besides, when was the last time you heard a death metal band reference Kahlil Gilbran (\"What is evil, but good...\")? It's nice to hear bands depart from the usual Nietszche, Lovecraft etc, even if the work cited is of a much more optimistic spirit than the bands' actual lyrics. \n\nOverall, if you have a tolerance for somewhat accessible metal but stop short of fully mainstream crossover music, you'll find much to appreciate here. Even if you aren't really a fan of At The Gates, this album might provide the perfect fix that both their main eras lacked for you. Although I love The Red In The Sky and With Fear..., I actually find myself spinning this album more than either of them. Despite how overlooked it is, it's an underrated classic that at least deserves a listen from any discerning metal fan.\n",
        "\nWhen I was starting to get into melodic death metal at first, I practically looked up some good bands. At The Gates was a band that kept popping up, so finally I decided to check them out. Terminal Spirit Disease is arguably the album that got me into melodic death metal. I loved this bands music but had never gone back and listened to this, their debut. So I finally decided to. And to be frankly honest with you, I absolutely HATED it. I thought the music was unorganized, bad, and Tomas Lindberg sounded worse than ever. Finally about a month ago, I decided it was time that I should listen to some old At The Gates. By this point, I was much better acquainted with the genre, and by this point, I was liking a lot more death metal than before. I played the first song, the title track, and was absolutely blown away. It WAS absolutely terrible organized, and I DID think Lindberg sounded like shit. However, this is what I've come to love about this album and the music on it.\n\nI have found only one word fit to describe this album: absolute total chaos. This album is chaotic in every sense, and when I say that I mean it is PHENOMENALLY chaotic. No, it isn't like Slaughter Of The Soul, where every take of every instrument is perfectly mixed, and every take is absolutely perfect. That is where this album differs, this is At The Gates minus the OCD of their later releases. While I do love an album like Slaughter, I find this album to be more brutal take and here's why: The disorganization, and overall youth of the musicians. They couldn't produce a good, perfect album. With their later work, they were doing simple guitar solos, Slayer style riffs on the guitars rhythm parts, and simplicity. Still good, but very simple. This album is not a simple take on melodic death metal, it is anything but that. Violins pop in out of nowhere, and while they seem useless and out of tune upon first listen, they add to the heaviness and overall somberness of this album. Influences not even from metal but from classical music, in particular from Dimitri Shostakovitch's fifth symphony, appear on the guitar solo to the song Kingdom Gone (which is a pretty fucking amazing song by the way). All this craziness is what makes me say \"wow\" after listening to it every time. \n\nTo compare this album with other melodic death metal, this album would be hard to equal. Probably the only comparable album would be, In Flames' Lunar Strain. Both these albums showcase all of these bands trying to find their footing, trying to impress with complicated riffs, and never using the same riff more than 2 times in a song. Basically, they all throw tons of riffs into 1 song, and still manage to have it be a song. But this album, still stands above all the other album for me, because of the pure chaos which is not really as prevalent on the other album, and the overall power this manages to convey. The guitars on this album also sound really different, compared to the Peavey 5150s used on In Flames' Lunar Strain. This is a weird, really fucking weird album, however, it is that weirdness that makes it the best. Standout tracks are the title opener, Kingdom Gone, and Neverwhere. My only 1 complaint with this album is with the mix, where the bass guitar is relatively trebley, making it more difficult to hear along with the guitars, and not adding as much low end power as I would like in such a song as \"Kingdom Gone,\" where they throw in loads of power and bass live.\n",
        "\nThis void of passion in media product form represents a complete deterioration in composition and concept for this band: an obvious over-simplification to pander to the lowest common denominator. The \"sell-out\" album in a nutshell. The fact that the lead single \"Blinded by Fear\" was completely finished in a half hour during a rehearsal (according to the band) just goes to show how much effort was put into this recording, a far cry from their earlier Alf Svensson (ex-guitarist) spearheaded recordings. Gone are the progressive compositions that felt like reflections of scenes from a story in the form of sound, replaced by commercial metal techniques held in a radio song format. The fact that the promo pic used for this album shows the band sitting around a table drinking beer further shows this was nothing more than the byproduct of jaded alcoholics scheming to make quick cash on what was trendy at the time (the commercially successful routes Carcass and Entombed traveled with their vapidity might have influenced this decision).\n\nDespite what the artwork might suggest, there is no grand scheme here as lyrics have taken a turn for the worst - sounding like a meme reiterated multiple different ways than a story. Shouting incessantly in a raspy voice about social ills, religion, and depression delivered through an angsty \"Life Sucks!\" manner. It's not unlike the ones Machine Head would later popularize with the song title being shouted ad nauseum for the chorus. The cliff-notes version to most of this would read something like: \"life sucks - suicide, religion is bad - suicide, it's like nothing is really real man - suicide, suicide suicide, suicide, suicide suicide\". Whereas their old lyrics had a place in the narrative of that albums concept, here they read like they took one idea and regurgitated it 9 different ways to \"get it over with\". I suppose these lyrics serve the function of this album well considering the drive-thru fast food restaurant television commercial jingle like nature of the music.\n\nEverything has devolved. Nothing here isn't something that wasn't already done by more successful bands. The music has been reduced to bouncy and mechanical rhythm riffs with cheesy melodies. Warmed over \"happy\" rock harmony 101 generic heavy metal fodder is interrupted by staccato chugging patterns on the bottom end string as a tide over for the next recombination of notes from the same typical heavy metal scales. The only difference here from other bands that use similar techniques is the down tuning and guitar tone having a typical \"Swedish\" tone (which, despite having recorded a demo and album at Sunlight Studios, was something this band never had - another commercial move perhaps?). The way this music was written recalls Metallica's Blackened with added Iron Maiden inspiration appearing in the \"catchy harmonies\" and galloping riffs.\n\nEverything is done in a verse-chorus format to the point of nauseating repetition. Here, it's obvious how this album influenced metalcore. \"Mad at the world\" verses, \"sad at things\" choruses, and happy \"raise your fists in the air! HEY! HEY!\" bridges with bluesy heavy metal solos show the same ideas being assembled into the same structural format. It's a formula that gets tiresome by the 3rd track, which features a guest solo by Andy Laroque that adds nothing to the song that the band themselves weren't already doing on the previous tracks. The only variation comes in the form of a few Pantera-esque mall grooves like those in World of Lies, Suicide Nation, and the end of the title track (band claims it was a Trouble influence); a heavy metal-ized parody of an early Dismember riff (Under a Serpent Sun) and a clean guitar break (Unto Others), but these are quickly thrown out for the same mindlessly formulaic repetition. A couple instrumentals also appear, one sounding like a hippie camp fire song (I was half expecting a drunken voice to yell out \"HEY-E-EE-YEAH! UNFORGIVE-E-IN!\") and another which sounds like a castoff from the Duke Nukem 3D soundtrack with it's repeating drone of midi synthesizer chords.\n\nThis is not even a good gateway album because the droning repetition, mechanical assembly line manufactured riff craft, and faked emotional appeals would make metal seem boring to the curious. There is no emotion wrapping itself around the riffs to fit the theme of songs (like how even the vapid Terminal Spirit Disease had), just mechanical processes toward mainstream recognizable \"aggression\" (like the shouting of \"Go!\" in the title track which recalls a Pantera level doofus mentality) and \"bittersweetness\". Here it is obvious that without the imagination of former guitarist Alf Svensson, At the Gates is a very typical band that makes very typical music dressed up in a way that would appear \"unique\" to the Machine Head fans who wouldn't know anything about death metal and has thus, been falsely declared a classic (Kerrang readers loved this album because of the marginal increase in quality over their typical Chaos AD listening habits). This media product is just that - a product, and a vapid one at that. No higher function than \"get down and boogie/raise your fists\" and thus no different from the wigger/dance culture mentality of music like Machine Head or Britney Spears in pandering to the lowest common denominator with their doofus mentality noise.\n\nI strongly recommend seeking out their first demo/ep Gardens of Grief and The Red in the Sky is Ours album and steering clear of this album. A depressing display of wasted talent that is analogous to the vacuity found in everyday modern life and culture (done before Iphones and Facebook no less). Avoid this Necrolord cover (made stupid with the awful re-imagined logo that looks stolen from a Sega Genesis box cover) adorned platter of sonic diarrhea like the garbage it is. Hopelessly vapid.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates' fourth album, Slaughter of the Soul, is often lauded as one of the best metal albums of the 90s. It would the album that is responsible for their expansive fan base. The album certainly has quite a legacy, practically spawning melodic death metal. So, does the music live up to the legacy? Well, I can confidently say this is a good album; however, I don't see it as the masterpiece that many claim it to be.\n\nThe primary reason for their large following could most likely be attributed to their simplicity and toned down brutality. As stated in the review title, \"What You See is What You Get\". This is an extremely straightforward record, offering little in terms of depth and atmosphere. Every song has a similar structure with little deviation being present. This can be especially seen in the rhythm section as the bass (which is not that audible to begin with) follows the guitars and the drumming mainly consists of standard thrash and heavy metal beats with minimal fills. These serve as the backbone to compliment the vocals and melodic guitar riffs. In addition, Slaughter of the Soul does not have the intensity of your average death metal album. The album is abnormally clean in terms of production for a death metal band and the riffs have a heavier emphasis on melody and harmony rather than brutality.\n\nThe vocals are a major highlight of this album. Tomas Lindberg pioneered this vocal style, which is now commonplace in melodeath and he is arguably one of the best vocalist in the genre. Rather than using the bellowing growls of regular death metal Lindberg employs an abrasive, almost black metal-like scream. What makes Lindberg's screams so effective are undeniably his power behind them. He literally sounds as if he has been stabbed in the stomach with a hunting knife and is spitting out blood as he screams. They definitely help in emotionally investing the listener.\n\nThe guitar work is the centerpiece of the album and the riffs had a huge influence on melodic death metal. I'm not that old and, therefore, wasn't around when death metal was in its prime; however, I could imagine hearing the first riff on \"Blinded by Fear\" and thinking, \"Well, this is something new.\" During that time death metal wasn't known for its melody and few bands in the genre were experimenting with melodic ideas (Carcass is the only one that comes to mind). It must have been odd for a death metaller to hear a death metal album with such an emphasis on melodic riffs and guitar harmonies.The riffs are rather simple in terms of structure, but are extremely catchy. They are, in essence, extremely melodic thrash metal riffs. Despite their simplicity they work quite well, creating catchy and fun songs.\n\nI cannot say that that there are any standout tracks since they all sound very similar. They are all fun and catchy, but offer little more than what they present at face value. Ultimately, Slaughter of the Souls is a consistently good album, but never rises above that consistent level. The simplicity and straightforwardness hurts the album, somewhat, making it one-dimensional in certain respects. If there were more layers, substance, and experimentation then this album would definitely be a masterpiece. This is not the case though. I recommend this for anyone who is new to extreme metal since its a decent starting point before moving on to heavier and more substantive metal.\n",
        "\nThere is nothing more but a continuous aura of melodic death metal that's flawless to me and also way underrated from my contention. If you respect this genre of metal, then I'd say that this is a monumental release that should've really impacted this genre collectively speaking. Not only do you get aggression, thick B-tuned guitar outputs, continuous spewing forward of shrieking vocal hatred and just a great ensemble of songs that are just original with awe-inspiring fury. It's one of those albums that you can play countless times and it never gets old. That's my absolute best way to sum up this release-monumental melodic death played perfectly.\n\nThe riffs are highly original and just plain brutal, but the vocals augment the music perfectly. The production quality, mixing, originality, atmosphere, aggression with utmost intensity-it's just all there. Nothing bad to say about this album, only respecting true melodic death metal and hoping that fans of this genre feel the same way about this release. It's one that stands on it's own in one of metal's melodic death metal hall of fame (if there was one). Faults are absent as the guitars are in unison with chunky riffing that just owns you. The whole experience of this album has you encompassed with revarity.\n\nMusically speaking, the guitars are just loud, heavy, melodic, tremolo picked frenzies, gallops galore, and leads that shriek. The production is a bit raw, but like I said, it is well mixed with everything fitting together reigning this world in infiry intensity. There is a track on here without having an alore of riffing that just stays in your brain. The lead guitar work is a little bit absent, but not entirely. There are some outputs of fast tremolo picked frenzies in that department accompanied by heavy use of the whammy bar. The riffs are the main focal points here which is what I think that ATG wanted to stick with making the album most memorable by way of it's euphoric impact on the metal world.\n\nTracks that stand out to me the most if you're eager and haven't gotten this album by now are \"Blinded By Fear\", \"Suicide Nation\" and \"World of Lies.\" However, the whole album is noteworthy and full of innovation. The riffs are done like no other release that I know of being into metal for almost 25 years now (my interest that is). Listen to the songs that I mentioned and if you're not convinced that there was a huge impact on the metal world when this came out. It's simply just amazing guitar work and metal music that you have heard like no other. Get it if you haven't already because it's just an onslaught of empowerment!\n",
        "\nPrepare yourself, this isn't the watered down filler fest that is the overpraised Slaughter of the Soul. But this-- this is true melodic death metal hailing from Sweden. Combining melodic tremolo picking from hell, mixed with a healthy dosing of complex song structures and then followed by godly drumming with just a dash of sloppy vocals of torment and despair and you get what is one of death metals most overwhelmingly complex and finest offerings (with a a slight violin aftertaste).\n\nTomas Lindberg supplies the vocals on this record and summons the souls of the tortured to lead a hand. Lindberg's vocals is truly devious, sounding like he is in constant pain while getting his jugular ripped out over and over again. It's a great effect for the album and his sloppy demented screams fill your ears with constant pleasure. The title track has a great opening scream that really shows Lindberg's might and power has a vocalist. \"Claws of Laughter Dead\" is another great display of this vocals with some great screams and vocal lines that will haunt any of those listening. Another track with some great singing is the monstrous \"Kingdom Gone\". This track has a powerful chorus and opening that sucks you right into the intensity of the music. Lindberg was a masterful singer at this period in his career and his voice on this album is superb. Sadly, he wouldn't keep this style long, but be glad it was shown on at least a proper album.\n\nGuitarists Anders Bj\u00f6rler and Alf Svensson do an amazing job on this album creating complex and progressive death metal through the extensive use of tremolo picking. Every song is roughly 99% tremolo picking and surprisingly, they are able to keep it interesting and fresh. Track like \"Windows\" and \"Neverwhere\" show their ability to do so. Other tracks like the intro to \"Within\" and \"Night Comes, Blood Black\" show the most different riffing variations with influences of doom (Within) and thrash (Night Comes, Blood Black). The guitar playing is very complex with tracks like \"Within\", \"Claws of Laughter Dead\", and \"Neverwhere\" that show a progressive side that I really adore. The duel guitars also play competing melodies at times, like on \"Windows\" and \"The Scar\" which make the depth of the album even deeper. Guitar solos are pretty absent on this album except the track \"Claws of Laughter Dead\" which in actuality is a rather weak solo but then again it doesn't really bother me now after hearing it so much. \"The Scar\" is radically different from the rest of the tracks featuring only clean guitar and whispered vocals. This is a great track that really sets the mood for the following track. Overall the guitar work is very good, full of interesting riffs and song structures that are backed by a killer tone that makes this album really great.\n\nThe bass work on this album is also very good. Jonas Bj\u00f6rler has some nice diminished bass breaks on tracks such as \"Kingdom Gone\" and \"Claws of Laughter Dead\" that drive the overwhelming music to even further limits. The bass follows the tremolo picking fest that is brought by the guitar and can be heard strumming fiercely on \"Within\". The tone is rather good and very clean which is refreshing to hear when the bass peaks its head above the tormenting screams and pounding drums.\n\nThe real star of the show is Adrian Erlandsson on drums. This is hands down some of the best drumming in death metal. Erlandsson takes the conventional 'blast beating through the whole song' style of death metal and throws it out the window. Erlandsson does show off some blast beats but shows he can do so much more on tracks like \"Through Gardens of Grief\" and \"Within\". Other than complex beats and rhythms that makes this album so great, the fills are even more enticing. \"Neverwhere\" and \"Claws of Laughter Dead\" have amazing drum breaks that are so good you couldn't help but showing off your air drumming skills. The drum tone is very nice and clear for death metal that usually consists of horrid tones and production, but thankfully this album does not follow those stereotypes. Overall the drumming is phenomenal and shows Erlandsson's skill in the best fashion available.\n\nOther than traditional death metal instruments there is also a healthy dose of violin present on this record. As heard on \"The Red in the Sky Is Ours\", \"Through Gardens of Grief\" and \"Within\" most prominently, the violin actually fits well within the tremolo picking filled music. The violin certainly gives the songs a more sophisticated feeling to the tracks when in reality, they are not. But none the less, the violin is a nice touch to the music and makes for some great \"WTF IS THAT!?!?\" moments for first time listeners.\n\nIn the end, this is At The Gates one and only masterpiece before slowly dumbing down their music down to conventional and acceptable standards. Made great with disgustingly amazing vocals, interesting tremolo picking and godly drumming this album deserves to be heard. Definitely check this album out for some great and complex melodic death metal, or if you're a fan of out of the ordinary death metal.\n",
        "\nA good number of so-called classic albums don't fully reach such a state until long after their time, achieving a kind of cult classic status at first that eventually blossoms into an army of reminiscing minds of better days gone by. Some classics, however, achieve near instant success and become a genre staple right in the midst of things, and sometimes the band literally never recovers from it for some reason. These are the sort of albums that, regardless of the intent of the band, spawn a whole legion of imitators in fairly short order and brings about a genre revolution of sorts, and in the case of \"Slaughter Of The Soul\", this would be the signature sound that defined the Gothenburg scene and all its international imitators in the late 90s and so forth. And while imitation is said to be the ultimate form of flattery, it is also the key ingredient in market saturation that will eventually inspire a backlash in certain quarters, as can be gleaned from the healthy number of critics that this album has earned since the close of the 90s.\n\nWhile most trend setting albums stand on a varying level of artistic merit, there is usually an over-emphasis on accessibility that will go with such a collection of songs that makes it vulnerable to heavy emulation, as well as shorten its shelf life. In the case of this album, the primary symptoms of this tendency are the usual down play of complexity and flash in favor of predictable song structures, along with a combination of brevity and repetition that makes for quick digestion. Apart from a few outliers, most albums will tend to employ a few shorter, catchy songs in order to wet the appetite before leading the listener down a maze of intricacy. But this album is more of a straight and wide path, albeit one that is nicely ornamented with a few beautiful melodic interludes and guitar shred breaks, like the occasional tree or shrub amid an endless landscape of tall grass. This isn't to say that the album is boring or lacking in passion, but it definitely wants for a little more than the occasional acoustic interlude gimmick or a few scattered sampled atmospheric sections to break up the limited array of riffs and progressions.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that really deviates from the predictability of the arrangement is the vocals of Tomas Lindberg, which are loaded with rage and fury. His vocal style is a good bit more agonized than guttural, almost like a upper mid-ranged hardcore shout that has been painted over with a greater degree of darkness and intensity that gives it a superhuman character. Just about every American metalcore band that has tried to employ this style of toneless shouts usually ends up sounding comical or even gimp-like, and even this band's own home town compatriots In Flames' vocalist Anders Frid\u00e9n struggled to really get this style down to the point that it sounded convincing, let alone exemplary. Yet at the same time, there is a bittersweet reminder of the deliberate limitation present on this album as generally mundane, thrash-infused anthems such as \"Blinded By Fear\" and \"Under A Serpent Sun\" are given that little nudge over the hurdle by the intense bombardment of emotion and anger coming from Lindberg's pipes.\n\nIn spite of the mix of grandeur and mundaneness, this album is pretty much worthy of the level of emulation that came after it, though obviously not every band that came after toting the \"Slaughter Of The Soul\" stylistic banner was really worthy of what they were carrying. Ultimately this approach to album construction standardized the melodeath style to the point that more multifaceted albums like \"Skydancer\" and \"With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness\" became a rarity, and latter 90s efforts out of Dark Tranquillity and In Flames would follow a similar model to this, all but to the point of continuing At The Gates' studio career since the band never recorded any new material since. At the same time, the level of exposure this album and the style it influenced reflect its vassal nature in regard to what happened in the style previously, including the band's own older efforts. Perhaps its unfair to wholly judge this album based on the excessive output of knockoffs, but hindsight is definitely a factor for anyone who has listened to anything in this style since 1996. It's a good album, and definitely a fun one, but it lacks the amount of depth to have a lasting level of staying power, which pretty well explains why there's always hunger for more albums of this sort.\n",
        "\n'Gardens of Grief' isn't just a four-song EP. It is the beginning to the career of one of the most widely hailed melodic death metal acts of all time, and also a shining example of that band's talent throughout the grunge-dominated 90's. Of course, any of you reading this review will know that this band is definitively At the Gates-a band that, not without the everlasting success of their stunningly talented effort 'Slaughter of the Soul', released their first EP after just four months of practicing music together. \n\nUnfortunately, At the Gates' earlier work, especially 'Gardens of Grief, is often overlooked by those who were introduced via 'Slaughter of the Soul' or even 'Terminal Spirit Disease'. So just why is it that significant to the band's career, apart from being their first actual release? Musically, it naturally doesn't differ that much from the band's debut album 'The Red in the Sky is ours', itself serving as a widened divide between fans of the band, as to whether it really is good or not. However, lyrically, At the Gates couldn't be further from the stereotypical features that recur within the genre of melodic death metal itself. As opposed to suffering, misery and torture of all kinds possible, everything seems to be in touch with the human soul and mindset. The content still refers back to every bit of darkness, death and destruction that can be found, but here At the Gates excel in giving off truly insightful meaning with their lyrics alone. Here's a few examples:\n\n\"...floating away within dreams/from a thousand worlds/my soul has left the spheres of man/ for all time...\" (from the opening track 'Souls of the Evil departed').\n\n\"It is cold out here/and lonely is my journey/I walk the trail of broken souls/the darkest path through infinity ...\"(from the band's self titled track, 'At the Gates').\n\nI could go on in analyzing how brilliantly written these lyrics are, but this is a music review. I mentioned earlier how the music isn't that dissimilar to the band's debut album, but that doesn't mean to say the band don't have their outstanding moments. 'Souls of the Evil departed' starts very melancholic indeed, with a briefly dull tone in the background, and then hits the listener predictably enough with its scything guitar work against a horribly raw production. I say 'horribly' raw, because it just doesn't do the guitar work justice. This leads to another slight problem with 'Gardens of Grief': The vocals themselves. Of course, Lindberg's vocals would become much more refined on later releases by the band, namely the 'Terminal Spirit Disease' album and so on, but on the band's earlier work, they don't prove to have much of an effect. It's a shame because, notwithstanding the fact that the band had barely played together for longer than four months upon the release of this EP, the lyrical content is extremely well thought out.\n\nHowever, what is also outstandingly good is the band's actual performance, regarding in particular the extremely well executed guitar work. Both Bj\u00f6rler and Svensson rip and tear their way through every one of 'Gardens of Grief''s songs, making each and every one also stand out. On the band's self titled anthem 'At the Gates', itself developing a uniquely mysterious and epic sound with every passing second, the twin guitar leads prove to be a musical success, even at times embracing a slight influence of the second wave of black metal into its sound. It isn't just the guitars that stand out however, but also the drum work, which have one hell of a vitally important presence within At the Gates' sound. Yes, Erlandsson is well renowned for his excitingly and staggeringly technical drum work, but since At the Gates was his second band proper, it proves to be yet another highlight for 'Gardens of Grief'.\n\nYou may have heard the band's most successful effort 'Slaughter of the Soul'. You may have been introduced to their talent via 'Terminal Spirit Disease'. You may even have listened to everyone of their studio albums, including the well structured 'The Red in the Sky is ours' and equally as menacing 'With Fear I kiss the burning Darkness', but if you haven't so much as listened to 'Gardens as Grief', you will be missing out on a lot-because, whether you disagree with the following statement or not, 'Gardens of Grief' is a prime example of just how incredible At the Gates were to become.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates are one of those Swedish bands that doesn't really need an introduction for anybody really eager enough to dig as deep as their first demo, Gardens of Grief, which was released in 1991. Being one of the more distinct sounding bands from the whole original Swedish death metal scene, they have managed to spit out a couple of really great albums in the 90s, the pinnacle of their career being 1995's \"Slaughter of the Soul\", which was not only copied by bazillions of uninspired \"metal\"core bands later on, but was that album with which At the Gates went out with a bang soon afterwards.\n\nPeople listening to At the Gates, as far as I know, mostly know their 1995 album, yet fail to comprehend that while that may be a pretty good album to slowly introduce someone to this kind of harsh sound, this band had a lot more musical and artistic output to flaunt with before that specific album. Hardcore At the Gates fans will know what I'm talking about when I say that this band has released some of the more twisted, desperate and aggressive sounding stuff beginning with their first album \"The Red in the Sky is Ours\". However, one little release is often missing in this grand collection of pure destructive music, namely their 1991 demo entitled \"Gardens of Grief\". Now not only is the front cover of the later release of this demo (see Gardens of Grief / In the Embrace of Evil split with Grotesque) intriguing, but the music also. What we have here lads is a chaotic mix between great song composition, one of metal's best vocalists (in my humble opinion) screaming his shit out and pure maniacal death metal the way its supposed to be played. Right from the start of the first track you will get nothing less than a punch in your face, to the groin and to the balls. Tempo changes along with the massive output of riffs used work perfectly to create a unique atmosphere that sends you right to hell. This is one of those birth moments of a band that further defined the typical \"Swedish sound\" that most of us know as being a kind of mix between crunch and white noise. Every song on this tape has a very mature approach towards composition, not sounding very melodic, but dark, vicious and awestruck. There are no moments where the music stops for some silly interlude and every bridge or change in structure adds to the overall monument that is the music. This is fierce, ruthless death metal played by people who had a spark in them and wanted to play crazy music. For a demo tape, the mix is good, not sounding too ripe but not too shabby, just the way I like it.\n\nThis demo is a very good example of how a rough start can prophesy a band's great career with no absolute low point whatsoever and be a marker for good things to come. If you like this bands later material, the Swedish sound in general, or just want to hear something great and fierce, give this demo a go, since its still better and cooler than most of the \"modern\" stuff nowadays.\n",
        "\nMy perception of this album has been constantly changing. The first time I listened to it I felt it to be a very soft and elegant. But as I listened to it more often, I picked up on its subtleties, such as the blend of the dark and sinister sounds of Stockholm death metal and Norwegian black metal, the classical use of counterpoint, and the haphazard song progression. \n\nNow part of what makes this album unique is the overall sound. I have yet to find an album with such rough production that has this kind of grace and beauty. Tompa's black metal influenced shrieks sound like a more refined version of Varg. Ferocious and powerful, yet not overbearing to the point where it's down right excessive like Varg's voice on the early Burzum records. The bass is somewhat buried under the flurry of drums and guitars, but sticks through sometimes and makes the floorboards shake with sub-sonic breaks. The guitars sound like graceful saws digging into flesh and bone, sounding like a half-way point between quiet, lo-fi, and fuzzy black metal and sludgy, gritty entombed style death metal. Adrian's kit is a bit shaky here and there, sometimes sounding clear through the mix, sometimes being buried underneath the mass of writhing guitars.\n\nThe lyrics are obtuse and pretty hard to decipher. With The Red... it's easy to tell that most of the songs had to with blasphemy and insanity, but with this album I just can't really tell what they're trying to say. The only song I can figure out is \"raped by the light of christ\", which I can assume is saying take control of your own destiny and don't surrender your will to blind faith. \n\nThis is something I'd definitely recommend to a fan of black metal and the more classical influenced melo-death (like the early Dark tranquility releases). Despite some flaws (mostly the tendency to recycle some riffs into other songs), this is a fairly enjoyable listen that might appeal to some death metal fans (like myself).\n",
        "\nAh, Sweden. A home to a wide array of extreme music sub genres. Some well recognized, other fairly overlooked. Everything from black metal to grindcore to crust punk has taken up residence there. But only one genre can call it home, and that is the double edged sword of melodic death metal. A genre that took extreme music into territories of effervescing grace and beauty, but also served as the template for the abomination known as metalcore. But this isn't the Iron Maiden worship found on albums like The Jester Race or Slaughter of the Soul. This is something much darker and foreboding. It's as if Entombed had a baby with early Norwegian black metal. The frantic structure, raw production, melodic interludes, and bleak atmosphere combine into a very strange and unique album. \n\nStarting with the production. It sounds like a blend of what you'd hear on Leprosy, Soulside Journey, and Left Hand Path. Some tracks are very clear and cut through the mix (drums, vocals), while others get muffled underneath everything else (extra guitars, bass, violins), but this only enhances the quality of the album, as it adds to the overall atmosphere. \n\nTompa's vocals are raw as hell on this album, sounding more like Martin van Drunen than himself on the following albums. He uses a technique that sounds like a mix of yelling and shrieking, while being strangled. The guitar work is very strange. It almost borders on experimental on how it flows from chaotic and dissonant to melodic and graceful. The blend of death/thrash and black metal elements is almost dizzying. It's absolutely mind blowing how the band as a whole is able to hold down all the unconventional time signatures and tempo shifts. There's some sloppiness in Adrian's drumming, but on the whole his drumming works in the context of the album and adds to chaotic atmosphere. As I previously mentioned, the bass kind of takes a back seat, but still provides a nice bottom end to the whole. \n\nThe only drawback to this album is how some of the tracks blur together, but this is a small flaw as most of the album has enough variety to maintain my interest. If I had to pick standout songs I would choose Kingdom Gone, Within, Windows, Neverwhere, and The Scar. Kingdom Gone is a prime example of how blackened death metal should sound. Raw, gritty, and frantic, not overproduced and bland like newer Behemoth. Within is a ballad of a journey through the human psyche, starting off slow and ominous and picking up tempo with chaotic blast beats and frantic tremolo riffs and a few melodic touches towards the end. Windows has a very melodic intro, and then drops into straight death metal with some melodic fills throughout. Neverwhere is my all time favorite At the Gates track. All change ups are insane and are fairly memorable. The Scar is the most unique song, being devoid of any bass and drums, and instead of yelling/shrieking, Lindberg whispers the lyrics.\n\nIf you like death metal and early black metal, then this will definitely be your cup of tea. With elements from albums like Human, Leprosy, Left Hand Path, Clandestine, and Deathcrush, this is sure to please any old school fan.\n",
        "\nThis is one of those albums where you either blindly praise it and take its popularity and importance far too much into consideration or you despise it with every fiber of your being just because everyone else like it. OR you can do what I did and think for yourself and bring yourself to objectively say \"I like this,\" or \" I don't like this.\" Seriously though, if you really think about it, you should like this. Slaughter of the Soul is a fantastic album!\n\n*Army of haters closes the page*\n\nFor those of you still with me, I'd like to point out that when you really think about it, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE GOTHENBURG SOUND!! Be honest, how many melodeath bands from Gothenburg are there let alone bands that people know or care about?! First three that come up, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates... and uhm... Dimension Zero, oh wait, that's Jesper Stromland and Glenn Lungstrom (pretty much In Flames). Uhm... Gardenian? Wait, not many people know or care about them. So, the three left that matter... they all sound completely different. In Flames had a lot of melody and those folksy acoustic guitrars, DT had a lot of really technical riffs, and At the Gates had the anti-religious, misanthropic brutality. Yet for some reason people seem to group these bands and pretty much any band that decides to abandon some of the death in death metal for melody (*sarcasm* How could they?!?!) into a category they consider \"stereotypical Gothenburg bullshit.\" I sigh at these people. Onto the music.\n\nAs the band states themselves in the lyric book (in the DVD bonus rerelease version at least), they wanted to open this up with a really catchy thrasher. \"Blinded by Fear\" more than succeeds. The song is intense througout, has one creepy part, then explodes into one of the catchiest and to the point leads I've heard in a while. Plus, it's worth mentioning that the lyrics are incredibly memorable and flow very well.\n\nThis sort of thing happens throughout the whole album. The songs all have intensity, catchiness and well thought out riffs. Though, I will say that I think the intro riff to \"World of Lies\" is kinda stupid. Other than that, riffage is all good and each song is distinctly different than the others. On top of that, the leads are fantastic. Notable mentions other than the one mentioned earlier are \"Cold\" and the title track in the lead department. \n\nVocally, Lindberg is going all out here. Unfortunately, I think the vocals feel very produced. I know how great the vocals are out of the studio, and I think the extra production was unnecessary. So, basically the vocals are great, but thehy could have been just as good without the production. \n\nThe rhythm department is tight here. Drumming keeps a thrashtastic rhythm going and doesn't obnoxiously show off, which I feel far too many drummers do. And the bass manages to keep the guitars going strong while not trying way too hard to be in the front. Though, I must complain about the fact that it feels like bass doesn't add much to the composition of the music and stays as support more than it should.\n\nThe two instrumentals on the album are fanfreakingtastic. \"Into the Dead Sky\" is a perfect breather song and has some of the most beautiful acoustic work I've heard outside of Opeth songs. When the other instruments come into the mix, it comes together perfectly! And the closing track is creepy. Creepy in an atmospheric way. It's simple, yet it's meant to be! Quite possibly the best closer they could have come up with. I feel that it would be the perfect background music to watching the entire world crumble. Perfect moment that just makes me stare blankly at my hand thinking, \"Whoah...\"\n\nSeriously though, this is probably At the Gates' weakest effort BY FAR. I don't blindly love this album, and no one should. But I don't blindly hate it because it's actually good! Seriously haters, get your heads out of your asses.\n\nGet the bonus tracks version if you can. It's kind of a short album and the extras are awesome.\n",
        "\nThis was around the point At the Gates started to get a little less interesting, whilst some of the factors that made their debut such a cool affair were still used to good effect, the inclusion of a certain degree of the more pugilistic riffing style that dominates Slaughter of the Soul dilutes Terminal Spirit Disease \n\nAlso is the fact that while this album bridges the old and new, you may as well listen to The Red in the Sky is Ours for their creepy, sprawling style of true melodic death metal, and obviously Slaughter for the articulate Gothenburg riffing. Both of which do it better as opposed to ever so slightly unfocused blend of the two. \n\nStill Terminal Spirit Disease isn't without its own merit, and at just over half an hour this is a fairly digestible slice of music, ideal for bus rides and shorter walks, or even something to spin while getting ready to go out. As I said earlier this is a little less interesting, but it is far from bad. The riffs are quite good, and are certainly well articulated, the acoustic guitars are handled nicely and its nice to see the violin still being used (sparingly though). \n\nThe production is, as with their debut a little rough around the edges, especially when compared with the follow up, but still it has its charm and I suppose it will ease the passing of the album for the more \"true\" fans. The melodic guitar parts are really nice, and are utilized in true Swedish fashion, maybe not as interesting as with the debut but still good.\n\nThe worst thing about this release is that it is passed of as a full-length, even though a third of the tracks are bloody live, so really this is just a fairly generous EP. Still hardly a massive niggle, but it does hurt the final scoring a little.\n\nTracks such as \"Forever Blind\" and the title track are amongst the best of the bunch, \"The Beautiful Wound\" is also pretty sweet, and has some cool melodic guitars around the start. Overall this isn't an album I'd pay premium for, but would serve as a small treasure from the bargain bin. A solid addition to a death metal collection, although purists should probably proceed with caution as I'm sure you will tell me this is when they started to get \"gay\"\n",
        "\nAt the Gates shouldn't need an introduction, pretty much any metal head knows this band and obviously a certain album they released in 1995. This here is the bands debut album, and arguably their finest. For my money I'd say The Red in the Sky is Ours is the bands finest, and here I'll explain why. \n\nAt first I actually dismissed this as budget Swedish death metal, but on further inspection I found this a lot more noteworthy than I had first imagined. For one this was 1992 and a lot of the Swedish death metal bands were just starting to find their feet and/or were crawling out of the woodwork. Whilst acts such as Necrophobic and Unanimated would come to do this style a lot better, for the time this was pretty damn cool and even original.\n\nThe inclusion of violins in places was a particularly interesting move, and really helped separate At the Gates from their peers. It also added a particularly creepy edge to the bands sprawling, twisting death metal. Their use of more melodic guitar harmonies worked particularly well too, and I'm sure acts as diverse as Edge of Sanity and Opeth would have took note, as well as some of the Swedish black metal acts. \n\nEven the guitar riffs have a unique edge to them, and the album just generally boasts a cool obscure feel that was far away from what they would later become renowned for. Whilst the production is a little rough around the edges it adds more to the charm than anything, the guitar tone is punchy, and the drums sound natural, the bass sounds pretty good too. As for performances, I've mentioned the guitar work a couple of times, but its really well done. Anders and Alf definitely had something to say, and they said it in spades with their guitar work. Tomas Lindberg's vocals are also worthy of note, firmly routed in the Swedish school of shouting manical vocals as opposed to the US \"cookie monster\" style, Lindberg's vocals were exactly what the doctor ordered here.\n\nNaming standouts isn't necessary, the album has a wonderful flow, as melodic as it is schizo, The Red in the Sky is Ours is a quality release and ultimately stands as At The Gates' finest. This is a mandatory addition to any Swedish death metal collection, and shows what the Gothenburg scene could have shaped up like given different circumstance.\n",
        "\nFolks, what we have here is arguably one of the most significant albums in all of metal, regardless of whether you love it or hate it. At the Gates\u2019 swansong effort, Slaughter of the Soul, has been the introduction (and sometimes even the gold standard) for death metal for countless fans, while also being the inspiration and direct influence on much of the popular modern metal music scene as we know it. While setting the blueprint for what melodeath was supposed to be, this also influenced everything from metalcore, to deathcore, to modern thrash, and has had a smaller effect on most other subgenres as well. The thing is, Slaughter of the Soul not only popularized a certain sound, but as an album, it was one of the first extreme metal albums to really embrace the glossy, polished sound that has seemingly become a staple of popular metal as we know it, for better or worse.\n\nI just spent an entire paragraph trying to sound unbiased. Be happy, because now I\u2019m going to let the haterade flow! As anyone who knows my taste in metal might expect, I despise this album. This album not only had a huge influence in destroying the future of metal, but also sounds like mindless fodder for children on its own. It\u2019s obvious how this album became the one that new fans of metal (particularly mainstream metal) latched onto immediately\u2013it basically has the qualities of a pop album. This is a shallow, downright juvenile album that is the equivalent of over-sugared candy in the diets of metal fans everywhere. Sure, this album has the hooks, the catchy riffs, the melodic solos, and all of that nonsense, but in the end, it lacks substance. Simply put, Slaughter of the Soul has no depth at all, and ended up being the final blow to pure metal as we knew it.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some of the songs here. \u2018Blinded by Fear\u2019 is the first track, as well as the single from the album. The mere fact that this album had a legitimate single should be the first warning flag. With this song, we\u2019re presented with the basic formula of a catchy riff over a blastbeat. Sometimes the riff changes, sometimes the drumming switches to double bass plodding. Also, there\u2019s a melodic, short, unadventurous solo. Of course, that\u2019s pretty much the formula for this entire album. Don\u2019t get me wrong, this song is quite catchy, but it\u2019s so utterly one-dimensional that it makes me sick to my stomach.\n\n\u2018Slaughter of the Soul\u2019 continues the formula, except this time having a really boring riff behind the vocals during the verse. This is another common trend on the album, leading me to believe that this is literally a pop album. Everything here is either incredibly guitar-centric or vocal-centric depending on the part of the song that it\u2019s insulting. Of course, this is metal, so being guitar-centric should be good, except the guitar parts are utterly boring. We either have a stale riff, a wimpy lead melody, or a solo. How fun. There is no intricacy whatsoever, nor is there anything remotely interesting. The riffs are headbang-able, though, so if you want some mindless music to stupidly wave your hair to, then go for it.\n\nIf the tracks don\u2019t start to blend together by now, then god (satan?) bless you. The main problem here is that everything is interchangeable. There is simply no cohesion going on, and that at any given moment, you could feasible trade out any riff here and put in another riff from the album. This is a significant problem in that it shows that nothing really builds off anything. There is no cohesive whole entity with which to listen to and understand the development of. Instead, this is pop drivel. Poppy, generic, melodeath drivel.\n\nI\u2019d like to give special mention to another track that simply bothers me, \u2018Into the Dead Sky,\u2019 an acoustic instrumental piece. As odd as it may seem, this track is the one that most exemplifies my gripes with Slaughter of the Soul as a whole. On its own, this is a nice little piece. There is nothing offensive about it in any way. However, it also doesn\u2019t really do anything at all, feeling completely out of place, while also not adding anything to the atmosphere of the album (which is completely not-existent, by the way). I\u2019d like to compare this to \u2018The Scar,\u2019 from their debut album, The Red in the Sky is Ours. \u2018The Scar,\u2019 even with its shit-tastic production value, does an excellent job of evoking a sense of emotion through simple layering and counterpoint, with melodies contrasting each other to create a very tense feeling throughout. There is nothing complicated about it, but it has its slight changes throughout, while also serving as an excellent gap between the last two songs.  In addition, it maintains the air of bleakness that The Red in the Sky is Ours had.\n\nIn the end, this seems to be the main problem. At the Gates showed a great degree of creativity with their debut, crafting an interesting, decently complex, emotive album that had its own special kind of atmosphere, despite its utterly shit production. That album had character! Slaughter of the Soul dropped all of that in favor of some dolled up, plastic, dumbed-down version of that. Instead of winding song structures, we now have some of the most predictable metal you can find, complete with a sterile sound and utterly unconvincing performances from anyone, especially Tomas Lindberg, whose vocals were phenomenally charismatic on their debut (\u201cKINGDOM! FUCKING! GONE!\u201d), now sounding empty and purposeless.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just that transition to sterility that makes this such a hated album in more purist circles. It\u2019s more the fact that this is the album that has had the influence on so much modern music as we know it. If anything, The Red in the Sky is Ours had some interesting ideas that could have really been great for other death metal bands to work with (the violins, no matter how haphazardly placed they were on the album, were an original touch that could have been greatly expanded on in future works). Slaughter of the Soul is, if anything, a direct contrast to this creativity in favor of an incredibly streamlined and palatable sound to appeal to the masses. Well, it certainly did appeal to the masses, and metal suffered as a whole from it.\n\nWritten for http://thenumberoftheblog.com/\n",
        "\nThis album is one of the first (if not, the first) melodic DM releases. Born from the ashes of Grotesque and Infestation, At the Gates went on to define the genre and inspired an entire scene, along with a slew of knockoffs. What they accomplished on this album is nothing short of legendary. From the chaotic opening track, through the melodic wonderland of \"Windows\" and beyond, this album is how melodic death metal should have stayed (sadly, it didn't).\n\nWhat sets the album apart is the guitar work. Alf Svensson's ability to craft such elegant, yet evil melodies and riffs is unparalleled. Regrettably, the band was never quite the same after he left. The vocals aren't quite what one would expect from a death metal band. Lindberg's vocals on this album are more reminiscent of black metal vocals than in his later vocal performances. However, I find they fit perfectly with the material here. His wails add more desperation to the atmosphere. The drumming is quite good, however it is sloppy in some bits. The bass is barely audible except in a few bits of the songs (ie: \"Within\"). The violin definitely adds a nice touch to the songs in which it is featured.\n\nThe production overall is lacking, and according to an interview, the band thought so too at the time. But overall this album is the start of a whole new world of death metal. At the time, it was a completely new style and I would have loved to been able to appreciate it back then. TRITSIO still holds up extremely well and should be used as the standard by which all melodic death metal should be judged by on a musical level. its only issue is the production, but considering the level of high quality music, one can easily look past the flaw and view this album for what it truly is; a masterpiece.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates needs to appear in every book written about the history of metal. Not only are they influential in the development of the melodic death metal, but their music isn't overrated. Sadly, they even get a lot of undeserved bashing done by the narrow-minded death metal elitists who can't understand why they've progressed. I'm not a great fan of the genre either, but i don't have preconceptions: This is a great album! Your typical melo-death judging by song structure, but the quality is not quite average...\n\n\"Terminal Spirit Disease\" is always aggressive, always melodic and always rough, but a lot of other records could be called the same. Some have harsh vocals as good as the ones of Tomas Lindberg that are expressing hate so well, some have drummers that do a decent forevermore blast-beating-job like Adrian Erlandsson, but almost none have solemn melodies so incredibly harmonious. \n\nBasically this is music for people that want to \"please\" the ear and release the anger at the same time. The almost omnipresent demented death growls are emotionally bound to the music and sound the same all throughout the album (just like on \"Slaughter of the Soul\"). The lyrics are misanthropic and abstract, thus everyone can interpret them in many ways and relate to them. As you can deduct from what I've said, the down-tuned medium-distorted guitars are the main artisans of the album. The riffs are repetitive at times, but not in an exaggerated manner. The guitar solos are all very good and most of the tracks have them. You can hear the bass lines only by paying much attention. \n\nUnconventional instruments (cello and viola) and the sounds of a storm can be heard at the beginning of the opener, \"The Swarm\", which also has the best guitar solo of the album. In addition, \"Terminal Spirit Disease\" has a nice \"Malmsteen-ish\" shred guitar solo. The only other song with atypical instruments is the melancholic song \"And the World Returned\" which only features the acoustic guitar+cello duo. Unique is also \"The Fevered Circle\". It has doom metal influenced riffs, though there is still a fast tempo like in all of the other songs except the instrumental. Now about the three live tracks... They are pointless: no crowd atmosphere, no new musical elements, but at least the quality of the recording is good. I really don't understand why At the Gates didn't compose something new, as they clearly have no problems in creating good music. Some of the similar albums are: Arch Enemy's \"Black Earth\", Sacramentum's \"The Coming Of Chaos\", Dawn's \"Slaughtersun (Crown of the Triarchy)\" and At the Gates' \"Slaughter of the Soul\" (of course).\n\n\"In a dreaming utopia - dead on dope\" \n\"The sun shall never greet my eyes again\" \n\"Your beauty rages through my veins\" \n\"I've lost all sense of what is real\"\n\"No goddamn sun, no goddamn pain\" \n\nIf you are a fan of Gothenburg metal, this is a must! If not, sincerely, you should still try it!\n",
        "\nOh yeah cause I thought it kicked ass. Well, it\u2019s certainly better than the previous album, but I think it\u2019s a step down from Slaughter Of The Soul. For one, the drumming is incredibly weak, and I don\u2019t really want to complain too much since it\u2019s an Erlandsson sitting behind the battery. The double bass sounds like they have pillows in the way, the toms cymbal crashing sounds too far away, and the hat shouldn\u2019t have been touched since it\u2019s a clattering twitch of a noise that you can barely hear anyway. His style is blast beats solely, but he does like to mix it up a bit with the riffs \u2013 still solidifies the fact that a great drummer can\u2019t fix a shitty drum sound.\n\nLindberg sounds like a maniac on the mic - pure growling with a cut-up throat. He doesn\u2019t really scream as much as he growls in an incredibly throaty way \u2013 raspy at its very core. Call it screaming, whatever, but his voice is dicey either way. At the time of this recording, he sounded more psychotic than Anders Frid\u00e9n and more controlled than Mikael Stanne.\n\nOverall, the riffs are melodic in a very classical way, whereas In Flames\u2019 The Jester Race was very power / heavy metal oriented. Therefore, the riffs can be seen as more intricate and deep, but if you wanted to hear even more elaborate and meaningful then I\u2019d recommend you Desultory, Immortalis, or Morpheus. Hell, even their peers Without Grief and Arch Enemy played Gothenburg pretty damn well (on their first couple of albums in the Arch Enemy\u2019s case), so go check them out instead \u2013 much more engaging riffs and a darker tone. The ones here range from murky, to sinister, to drawn-out, but at least listening to this isn\u2019t as trivial as At The Gates Spin-offs like Mors Principium Est or Naildown.\n\nIf you want to pay attention even more, then try to find out if the bass is useful at all. A lot of times it can stick to just following the simple rhythm, but here it\u2019s hard to make it and even so doesn\u2019t do any justice. Riffs I can compliment on something, but bass is just there for kicks. Oh yeah, and the live tracks are terrible \u2013 I admit that they\u2019re live tracks so a grainy sound will exist, but did you really have to add these to the album? They don\u2019t really add anything special to help the cause and the songs themselves are boring. If you wanted to hear those songs, you\u2019d go to their respective albums to hear them, not stick around to hear the ones with poor quality.\n\nSo, I\u2019m not a huge fan of At The Gates, but I\u2019ll take the more focused Slaughter Of The Soul over this one \u2013 even though that album isn\u2019t exactly the \u201cbe all / end all\u201d of Gothenburg either. Oh yeah, and the instrumental didn\u2019t really do anything for me \u2013 sounds like something that you\u2019d hear in a Persian rug market.\n",
        "\nEverything about this album blows me away every time I listen to it. Tomas Lindberg's tortured screams are some of the best metal vocals ever, nailing the perfect growling scream that is nearly impossible to imitate. The riffing on this album is all over the place and completely phenomenal. There are definitely some traditional \"evil\" melodic elements in the riffing, but the riffs break all the rules of traditional music and melody.\n\nThe riffing on this album is really what sets early ATG apart from every other melodic death metal band ever. They manage to weave melody that is incompatible with classical musical structures but still extremely pleasing to the ear into their music. They also manage to form those melodies in some of the most mournful ways possible. Listening to the guitar riffs alone can inspire a feeling of sorrow.\n\nWhen one adds Tomas Lindberg's amazing screams to the mournful melodic riffing, the end result is a work of amazing pure evil atmosphere. The guitars and basses are of course down-tuned and heavy as possible throughout. The drums are fairly straightforward, and pretty much exist to offer a backdrop for the two duelling guitars.\n\nThe two guitars' working together create great effects on this album. Usually during slower melodic parts (for example, near the end of \"Kingdom Gone\") one guitar will play a low, heavy riff while the other plays a high harmonic variation on the same riff. The same goes for the main riffs played during the vocals throughout the album. Even if the guitars are playing in the same register, their parts are varied just enough to create amazing harmonies that sound great but can't be explained using traditional theory.\n\nThe album is very rhythmic and stays true to its heavy, death metal foundation, but ventures into an atmosphere of total darkness and evil, borrowing some early black metal elements and implementing them into the riffing. The album also features many great clean acoustic and violin breaks which fit perfectly into the overall atmosphere. Every song is unique and amazing in its own way. The album is incomparable to any other melodic death metal release. This is what melodic death metal should sound like.\n",
        "\nEveryone knows At the Gates, Gothenburg metal, and more importantly Slaughter of the Soul; so I won\u2019t go into a long winded journey into the back history of such and just get on with why I think this is such an amazing album. Honestly, when I first heard this I wasn\u2019t aware of the movement called \u201cGothenburg melodeath\u201d and I wasn\u2019t aware of all those wannabe bands, all those legendary bands selling out (In Flames) and those straying into odd territory (Dark Tranquillity), but I was aware when I first heard this\u2026 that something amazing had been concieved. This one one of my first extreme metal albums I remember hearing few years ago with much enthusiasm I remember enjoying this straight from the get go. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve become more educated and knowledgeable towards metal and the scene I understand how split the community has become towards this. Slaughter of the Soul has some of the best melodeath riffs, melodic harmonies that perfectly fit in with the atmosphere of misanthropy brought in by the ridiculously amazing vocals of Tomas Lindberg. Those who know me, know I\u2019m a gigantic Lindberg fanboy, loving his performances especially in Nightrage and At the Gates, he\u2019s by far the best harsh vocalist out there. Songs like Under a Serpent Sun, Cold and the stand out title track all stick out to be some of the coolest vocal performances ever. From the opening riffs to Under a Serpent Sun to the twisted yell into distorted Gothenburg riffing the song erupts into probably the highlight of the album with one of the catchiest choruses on here. \n\nEverything about this makes this something special, from the stellar musicianship, the aforementioned vocals, to the slickened production all makes this highly memorable. The production gets a lot of slack I\u2019ve seen here from being too clean, too crisp or something that is frowned upon by morons who need it to be a cheap production for it to be decent or something. I think the cleanliness and heightened production only aid to the memorability of the songs, which is what Slaughter of the Soul runs on. The songs here, every fucking one of them, are highly memorable. For days, I\u2019ll have the riff to the title track playing in my head or importantly the awesome catchy as hell choruses and how it\u2019s possible to sing along to every song on here; Tomas Lindberg once again makes it just something above what it should be by delivering the goods with raspy goodness that is harsh as shit but still clearly understandable. \n\nThe songs on here are all highlights, even the melancholic instrumentals that meander throughout the album being somewhat skipworthy, are still enjoyable. The solos here are just as good as it should expect, even though they aren\u2019t especially out there or some sort of shred fest, they stick out like the solo in Cold, where the sweet effects or something build up the tension before spewing forth awesome shredding notes that are so melodic and fast that they go flowing in and out of the wind like free flowing rivers. Cold also has my favorite lyric/line from Slaughter of the Soul with the convoluted vocals of Lindberg ripping out, \u201cOnly the dead are smiling! Ohhhhh!\u201d Blinded by Fear is the perfect opener, starting from the strange and eerie opening nosies and spoken word intro, to the blasting riff and once again, awesome vocals. I dare you not to be singing along, \u201cTHE FACE OFALL YOU FEAAAARRSSS!\u201d, it\u2019s so fucking awesome. Then right off the bat it leads into another highlight, the title track with the sweet low riff and the pause and the infamous\u2026 \u201cGO!\u201d the chaos ensues with riffer and headbanging madness. It\u2019s so energetic and wonderfully brutal that it makes for such fun. There\u2019s another song to sing along to, being probably the second best chorus to sing along to as well as the best main riff, at 1:23 mark. Yeah, try not to headbang motherfuckers.\n\nI think Slaughter of the Soul is a monumental album in At the Gates career and the best Gothenburg release to date, finding it hard to discover a better, more energetic and powerful, and especially more catchy and memorable release. Everything about this is just simply awe-striking and it blows my mind how music can be so catchy and memorable sometimes. The performances here are just beyond all expectation, major props to Tomas Lindberg for being one of the best extreme metal vocalists out there and having such presence in every work he does. This is definitely essential to extreme metal fans, melodeath fans and more importantly, metal fans. Everything about this sums up what I enjoy in melodic death metal, it\u2019s hard to find songs that are just so downright memorable in their own individual right, short or not\u2026 my only complaint is I wish this album wouldn\u2019t end so quickly, but that\u2019s nit-picking, so I suggest ignoring the haters and buying this album.\n",
        "\nI dont understand the average rating of 75% for this album. For me this stands as ATG's best album. Ive only been into them for a few months, and at first couldnt particularly get into them after just trying their first album \"The Red In The Sky Is Ours\" but now i love At The Gates, and cannot wait for them at bloodstock.\n\nThis album is one which makes me look at a band like Arch Enemy and wonder why it is classed as melodic death metal? Most modern \"melodeath\" bands seem to have more in common with a blend of power and thrash metal than melodic death metal. For me this album is the complete culimnation of melodic death metal, hell it even sounds pretty close to black metal (a good thing by my book) just with the guitar playing more complex and melodic lines.\n\nAs for the music, At The Gates paint vivid images within my mind, with a very complex album with a vast number of riffs all flowing from one another. The guitars interact incredibly well with variatoins on riffs hich makes listening through headphones a greatly enjoyable experience. The guitars mainly play riffs which are quite high and almost all tremolo picked, it doesnt feature a great deal of heaviness or bombast but the songs are nonetheless definately beautiful.\n\nThe vocals are very similar to those in black metal and fit in very well with the overall sound. Some fans of brutal death metal could possibly see this album rooted to high in treble regions, but it allows for bass work to be distinguished easily and creates atmosphere.\n\nOverall it is a stunning album with no weak songs. It is unlikely most things i have ever heard and possibly the quintessential melodic death metal album. Try finding the song \"Raped By Christ\" and if you like that you will love the rest of the album. It's all down to taste at the end of the day, but out of all of ATG's albums this has more feeling and more interesting riffs than The Red In The Sky Is Ours, but still retains a mysticism and underground metal feeling that Terminal Spirit Disease and Slaughter Of The Soul do not (despite still being very good albums). If you're a fan of only latter day ATG this might seem raw as those albums are very produced, strucutred and finished, but this is a beautiful and epic gem with real feeling.\n",
        "\nThere are bands that have changed a lot their musical style during their career. Most of Swedish melodic death metal cult bands are among those and At The Gates is probably one of the best examples. They were the precursor of a musical orientation that exploded a couple of years later through Dark Tranquillity or In Flames. As these two disciples and plenty of others, they began playing melodic death metal and moved progressively to a more hard core/metal core oriented music.\n\nGranted that Slaughter of the Soul is their last release before they split up, this album is the one that has the most metal core roots. Although I generally don't stand this kind of music, I must admit that it's in the case of At The Gates really well done. They are an exception and improved themselves as the best band in this musical evolution. At the opposite of some of their compatriots who have just lost their soul by playing an annoying noisy piece of shit without variation or interesting riffs, they crush our ears and blow our minds with this Slaughter of the Soul and its extremely recommended captivating violence.\n\nThe instrument that is the less audible is, as often in this style, the bass. However, that doesn't affect at all the quality of the cd and the bass is just enough present to reinforce the power and atmosphere created by the guitars, whose riffs are all excellent and whose cohesion is undeniable. The drums are pretty good too, perfectly alternating quick parts and heavier ones. The vocals are very harsh, maybe even a bit harsher than on the previous album Terminal Spirit Disease. In spite of this vocal and musical intensity, At The Gates did not just seek to play the most violent music they could do, there is really a melodic research and the quality of most of the choruses is incredible. If you have the opportunity to listen to this stuff, you'll understand how unforgettable are the choruses of songs like Unto Others, World of Lies, Suicide Nation or Blinded by Fear. \n\nI first had the normal version of this cd, that means without the bonus tracks (there were 11 titles instead of the current version with 17 titles that is now the one we mostly find). The first edition length of 34 minutes would have been too short for a symphonic black metal or for a gothic/doom metal album, but it was just ok for the kind of music on Slaughter of the Soul. The six bonus tracks are, as often, less interesting than the rest of the cd and probably just a good way to make quick money. However, they remain quite good, before all the demo version of the excellent Unto Others, and they definitely don't reduce the quality of the album. Anyway, if you really consider them as worst than the rest, nobody obliges you to listen to them; so that they can only be positive. \n\nTo conclude, if there is one cd that marks an exception in all the albums of former melodic death metal bands who have integrated metal core influences in their later releases, it's Slaughter of the Soul. At The Gates was one of the best bands I've ever heard and this album is absolutely fantastic and shouldn't be compared to the mass of current shitty albums that are half way between melodic death and metal core. At The Gates were masters and they remained it until the end. The main difference between this album and the vast majority of so called similar releases results in the band's ability of creating a various music with crushing riffs and incredible choruses. Don't miss this masterpiece, it would be a sin.\n",
        "\nIf with their following albums, At The Gates would have helped to create the \u201cmelodic death metal\u201d, the very first beginning is quite different and not melodic. They were influenced by the old school generation of the death metal players from their mother country and, being very young, they played more or less like them with a sort of black metal touch in the guitars riffs.\n\nThe atmosphere is really gloom and the band sounds always quite fast and compact without being melodic at all. Since the opener \u201cSouls Of The Evil Departed\u201d we can really taste the group\u2019s essence made of obscurity and heaviness. Good some more progressive touches in the guitars lines by players, that despite the young age, already show a mature approach towards this genre. \n\nThe title track is weird in that sense with odd guitars parts and good tempos changes. Always inspired the drum work too, passing easily between a variety of tempos. The vocals are a bit common but quite powerful too, taking inspiration by the classic Swedish death metal with some good screams. Very good the fast bass drum parts where the group is less \u201cprogressive\u201d and more \nthrash/death.\n\nIn a song like \u201cAll Life Ends\u201d is inevitable the comparison with old Entombed: very good and raw. Dark the mid paced riffs with schizophrenic vocals and some keys sounds. The last \u201cCity Of Screaming Statues\u201d is quite famous amongst the At The Gates songs and, without being stunning, is a quite good example of a more complex way of playing death metal. Overall, a quite good beginning, a bit musically distant from the future releases and recommended to death fans.\n",
        "\nAt The Gates was a band I always thought were just okay, only having heard \"Slaughter of the Soul\" before this. While the album was a decent attempt at melo-death, it lacked substance and was far too repetitious for its own good. My curiosity of the band's earlier work was growing, and namely for this release having read other reviews on it being a more focused SotS. It was a relatively good decision.\n\nThe album has been one of the only things to rotate this often in my CD player for a long time. All six studio tracks are extremely well executed. They do stick to the same formula as \"Slaughter of the Soul\", however they don't begin thrashing for no reason or being brutal just for the sake of creating fast riffs and earning more brainless fans. While the guitar riffs are a bit upbeat, there is a lot of melody mixed in to tracks like \"The Swarm\", \"Forever Blind\" and \"The Beautiful Wound\". There is more melody to be found here than on SotS for sure. My one complaint is that some of the riffs are repetitious at times, and lose focus for where the song direction is headed. Naming off a good example is \"Forever Blind\". The introduction of the song starts with melodies and later breaks into a shred fest for a few seconds.\n\nAs for the other instruments: they're alright as well. The drum work is your average melo-death drumming, without the annoying \"TIC TIC TIC BLASTBEAT\" aspect. For this At The Gates get my complete respect because I don't get a headache listening to this as opposed to some new acts (that would be you in particular Mors Principium Est). There are the occasional tribal beats, namely on \"The Fevered Circle\" which suit is perfectly. Never is there a moment where the drums have filler moments on the album. As for the bass, well, the fact that it can be heard alone is a good thing. Bass lines can be heard by paying attention to the album closely. As for vocals\u2026 if you've \"Slaughter of the Soul\", they're nothing new. Screams and that's pretty much it. Perfectly suits the music here, and I couldn't imagine deep growls fitting this.\n\nThe release also has three live tracks: \"All Life Ends\", \"The Burning Darkness\" and \"Kingdom Gone\". These tracks alone made me want to see At The Gates this year at Wacken despite the distance. All three tracks sound like studio tracks since the production is really well done, and pack a large amount of energy. These same three tracks also made my curiosity rise in their death metal period. These three tracks are among my favorite songs I've heard from a live set in a long time.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who likes good melo-death.\n\nHighlights: \"The Swarm\", \"Forever Blind\", \"The Beautiful Wound\", \"All Life Ends (Live)\" & \"Kingdom Gone (Live)\".\n",
        "\nI've been an At the Gates fan for nearly 10 years now. Like most of their fans, I was introduced to them through Slaughter of the Soul. For a long time, as I tracked down their harder to find other releases, I held that final album of theirs to be untouchable, and indeed, I went through a long Gothenburg phase as I was finishing high school, and entering college. It was with the added maturity that comes in one's 20's that I was able to realize how banal the \"Gothenburg\" sound was, and how unlike the originators, namely At the Gates, the new pretenders to the throne had become. It was also not until I heard Terminal Spirit Disease, and Gardens of Grief that I would realize how overrated Slaughter of the Soul was. Now, after familiarizing myself with them, and having put some rather serious life experience under my belt, that last record of theirs has been pushed to the bottom of my list in favor of their second full length.\n\nWith Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness was the last At the Gates album that I heard, and at first, I was not impressed. I admit, the first listen was confusing, and sounded chaotic to me. It took me years before I finally \"got it.\" And this is an album that is not for every one, you really do have to \"get it,\" there is a moment when it clicks, and the whole thing makes perfect sense. It was their most lyrically mature and adventurous record, and their most musically adventurous. Everything after would strive for catchiness, which I have to say, in my opinion, is a bid toward the lowest common denominator, those folks who are uneasy when lyrics don't rhyme, and riffs are not straightforward. \n\nWith that off my chest, I can explain what it is about this record that has put it into my top ten of all time. I could go song by song, and explain why each song is so memorable, but that would take hours, and no one would read the 3,000 letter essay I could type on the subject, so instead I will go for primarily a general review. I'll start witht he riffs. They are indeed chaotic, and they shift in tempo, timing, and mood constantly. But that is the brilliance of them. Songs start mellow and introspective, then creep into something violent and furious. The acoustic passages are melancholy, lending a feeling of utter solitude to the record, which seems like a theme that overrides everything you hear. There are moments when the music swells into almost epic passages where one gets the feeling of being invincible in their complete aloneness. And other passages break through that make one feel completely alone and despondent. The melodies are there, and the attentive ear can hear how distinct they are. The changes in mood are most effective in some songs \"Raped by the Light of Christ\" builds slowly and bursts into a defiant rage. \"The Break of Autumn\" has a melodic creshendo that puts most so called Melo-Death bands of today to shame, while escaping being over the top the way every one seems to be now. \"Primal Breath\" ebbs and flows for those patient enough to listen. \"With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness\" seems simple at first, but when a careful listen is given, one can hear that it is actually an experiement in subtlely building melodies, and shows great restraint even in constant variation. Few times are there Death Metal riffs that can be fast, and brutal, but at the same time somber. This album is full of such riffs. \n\nWhat I love most about this record is the lyrics. Some of the best they penned, and perhaps some of the best that I've seen in Death Metal altogether. At the same time that every one else was making songs about opening up rib cages and eating the maggots inside, dissecting teenage virgins, or cutting up their next door neighbor in the name of satan, At the Gates was making songs about nature, love, passion, and the place that the human soul held in the face of eternity. These are not topics that excite 15 year olds eager to scare their parents and the cheerleaders that sit in front of them in math class, these are topics for people who have life experience and who think about things outside of themselves. Solitude is a big concept here, but never is it self pitying, rather, it is expressed as a necesity of life, as a part of being human. Songs like \"The Break of Autumn,\" and \"Raped by the Light of Christ\" best exemplifiy this. The idea of passion and love come up frequently, but not in the usual metal way of frustration at unattainable girls and such. Instead we see the idea the attachment can both submerge the self, and at the same time, be desperately desired. \"Stardrowned\" and \"Non-Devine\" use effective metaphors to convey this. Even better, there are several attacks on christianity, but they are done in a mature manner. No simple \"I hate god, satan is my master, I worship him at midnight in the forest\" garbage here, instead, we are given a sensible, and restrained expression of how oppressive organized religion is on the human soul and on human nature, with out being fed cartoonish fluff and Alice Cooper theatrics. Perhaps it is how rife this record is with metaphors that makes it so powerful. I am not spoon fed thoughts, instead, the lyrics make me think, and perplex me, even as they can be ambiguous at times, they are very satisfying, because what I take them to mean fits me perfectly. Its Death Metal for the thinking man, and thus, the brilliance of this record is lost on most people.\n\nIf you are tired of simplistic music, check this one out. Give it a few listens and listen to it carefully. It is meant to be experienced more than heard, and every time I play it, I hear something new, feel something new. The reason that this one is the most burried in all their catalogue, is that it was a record that required the listener to think, and sadly, even metal heads can be sheep sometimes.\n",
        "\nMaybe not, but without Alf, ATG really starts becoming what they are most known for. This is the sound that they would perfect on Slaughter of the Soul, and eventually influence a hell of a lot of bands, including the shitty mallcore scene. \n\nWhen the first riff from \"The Swarm\" shows up, you can immidiately tell that this is the At the Gates that most people know and love. Even the production resembles Slaughter of the Soul. I personally enjoy that album quite a bit, but it's far from their best work for me.\n\nThe structures are very linear on here. It's not like the previous two releases, where you have no idea where you are going. Riffs are catchier, and Tomas seems a bit more sane. You've got the obligatory acoustic diddy, \"And the World Returned,\" which doesn't really add much and seems kind of out of place and happy. Sorry, I'll take \"The Scar\" to that any day, as that piece really matched its context. \n\nIt almost makes me miss With Fear I Kiss the Burning Darkness, even though that's my least favourite ATG album. I felt that album had some strong elements, but tried WAAAAY to hard to be overly technical. On here, I feel as though they oversimplified everything. While this is what ATG are known for, it just doesn't match the sickness of the first two albums. It makes me wish there could have been a little more compromise between the two styles.\n\nAlf Svensson was a true madman of sick, disturbing riffing, and without him, ATG becomes something very palatable. Whether this is good or bad, it's ultimately up to the listener to decide, but I know where I stand.\n",
        "\nBetween the sublime greatness that is The Red In the Sky Is Ours, and their \"breakthrough,\" Slaughter of the Soul, ATG put out this album. While it is clearly a step forward as far as musicianship, it's really lacking in the sound and songwriting area. While I enjoy both of the aforementioned albums, their debut has to be one of the most original death metal albums ever. This one took a really, really long time to grow on me, and I almost gave up on it due to the sound.\n\nWhereas the first album had really disturbing material that took you on a journey through dark psychosis, and Slaughter of the Soul has linear structures, this has technicality and jarring structures that sometimes lead you nowhere. Kind of like leading you into a maze and then abandoning you. And it's really a shame, because Adrian gives his best drum performance EVER here, and the guitars are both doing a lot more unparralleled work, but there's just too much going on all the time. Tomas...well, he still sounds quite visciously deranged.\n\n\"The Break of Autumn\" is a prime example of the faults of this album, as well as my favourite song on here. Just when you start to really enjoy a certain riff, they throw something else in, completely throwing you off guard. You can hear Anders Bjorler really starting to have an influence on this album with the more logical melodic riffs, and this is probably the best writing that At the Gates ever had, but not enough work with the song structures themselves. \n\nIt might be the production too, that disrupts me. It's really trebly, which makes it feel grating. I once listened to this and thought \"wow, I wish that they could have just gotten the Sunlight sound with Tomas Skogsberg,\" but it is actually Tomas at Sunlight who recorded this. And Fred Estby. Goddamn, how could that trinity of elements fail to make this sound even at least palatable? One of the strengths of the debut was that gooey low end on the guitars that seemed to strangle you and pull you into the maelstrom of riffs. Now it just seems kind of hollow and without real punch. You can hear most of what Adrian is doing, luckily, but more emphasis on the double bass work would have been really nice. There seems to be no low end, so crushing riffs like on \"Blood of the Sunsets\" just glance over you. There is a lot of variation in the guitar work, allowing both Anders and Alf to shine simulaneously, but it's just torture on your ears to listen to. \n\nFor the parts of this album that work, they work really will, and I dare say that some of the ideas are better than the debut. Obviously, the flipside is that there are equally uselessly technical parts that do nothing but disrupt the listening experience. I'd really like to give this a higher score, but sadly...I cannot.\n",
        "\nThis is one hell of a hard album to really describe, as I've really never heard anything like it. It could certainly be called \"melodic death metal,\" but there sure as hell aren't any happy riffs here, or any of the catchy melodies that would characterize ATG's most renowned work. This definately leans more towards death metal, with a very strong doom vibe throughout and a definate touch of psychotic brutality.\n\nTempos range from fast to crawling, and I'd have to say that here ATG really shines when staying in the slower sections. Just the opening riff of \"Within\" twists around your neck and drags you down into the suffocating layers of the song. \"Through Gardens of Grief\" starts off with a grinding riff, then out come those nasty, strangling riffs, and a twisted violin melody at the end. \n\n\"Windows\" is probably the closest that they come to sounding like their best known work, Slaughter of the Soul, but there is still quite that odd feeling to the riffing between Anders Bjorler and Alf Svensson. This isn't like Sacramentum's Far Away from the Sun, where the counterpoint riffing and unparallell harmonies created something strange and beautiful, these riffs just sound sick. Sure, a lot of times, the guitars grind away in a typical Slayer fashion, but when they don't...they give you a really uneasy feeling. It's as if they are taking the songs somewhere unknown, usually to the bowels of some Lovecraftian nightmare.\n\nWhereas Tomas sounds possessed on here, and the guitar tone sort of wet and swampy, what really sounds strange on here is the violin. At times it provides a bizarre, floating melody, whereas on \"The Season To Come,\" it is rather an afterthought. \n\nThis certainly is not an album for a casual fan, as it does demand repeated listens to full grasp what is going on. You're likely to wonder what just happened after listening to it the first time, and even on repeated listens its kind of hard to expereince in pieces. One thing can be sure: this is not the product of sane people.\n",
        "\nThere has been much already said about this album in previous reviews, and since I only review for this website, this review will not be particularly expansive. After reading the positive reviews for this album, I feel compelled to state that there are always at least three primary ways in which to rate an album. First, one can review the album on its own merits, as objectively as possible, such as on the basis of its musicianship, its production values, its lyrical content, the quality of composition, and so forth. Secondly, one can relate the album to other albums created by the same artist, so as to determine whether the artist is progressing or regressing. Thirdly, one can relate the album to the entire musical genre to which it belongs, to assess where in the overall scheme of things the album belongs. It seems that many people reviewing Slaughter of the Soul rate this album on the first criterion, while blissfully ignoring the latter two - and even then, there is a lot that can be detracted from the \"own merits\" criterion.\n\nCertainly, the album is slickly produced, and the musical talents of At the Gates are on full display (though not nearly as impressive on earlier, more technical and ambitious outings), though lyrical content is bordering on what today would be known as \"emo\" and is hardly inspirational or thought-inspiring, while the quality of composition is highly suspect, given the pop song, verse-chorus-versus structure of every single track on the album. There is plenty of melody present, and every track is easily digestible, but much like bubble gum pop music, the allure fades away after a few listens. The only song that seems to hearken back to earlier times of grander composition is the opener, Blinded By Fear, and even this song could only be considered \"average\" by the standards of any previous work by At the Gates. \n\nPart of what made At the Gates so appealing over the course of their career between Gardens of Grief and Terminal Spirit Disease was their originality (after all, the style developed on Gardens of Grief and The Red in the Sky is Ours had an influence on the rest of death metal) and the reasonably chaotic song structures that adorned every album in this period. Melodies were beautiful yet palpably unrestrained, and song structures, while clearly premeditated, seemed to flow with an organic energy characteristic of an untamed beast that was aware of its start and end point but chose to be completely wild in the execution of its journey. \n\nOn Slaughter of the Soul, the beast has been tamed, if not outright slain, and every song has a predictable and neat quality about it, very much like a lot of the nu-metal and pop metal that followed the album. That is to say, the listener could become quite familiar with the album by about the second track, and comfortably enjoy the rest of the album with a sense of expectation that was not likely to be challenged. The other major problem with Slaughter of the Soul is that there are moments on the album, including in the seemingly thematically sombre title track, where the mood is notably upbeat, thus belying the alleged spiritual intent of the album. There are perhaps hundreds of albums in death and black metal that purport to address the issue of suicide and death in general, and they create a mood that is significantly more appropriate to the topic than is to be found on Slaughter of the Soul. All of these factors contribute to the inescapable conclusion that At the Gates did not put forth all of their creative energies in the execution of this album, which in the final analysis remains an unfortunate swan song to one of the most important and most talented death metal bands to ever have existed.\n\nListeners of this album should listen to every other album by At the Gates - not only will you be pleasantly surprised by what is on display, but you will also be privy to some of the best of what the death metal genre has had to offer.\n",
        "\nSlaughter of the Soul is an outrageous blasphemy against metal. It has more in common with a stale pop record than it does with an honest metal album. Why do people insist on holding this album in such high regard? What is it that they find here that is of such high quality? Nothing, but I bet the believers were fooled by the catchy hooks, ultra recursive songwriting and the absolutely laughable displays of \u201cemotion\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s most aggravating is that there are certain peoples whom honestly believe this is At the Gates best effort! Such persons should be laughed at, ridiculed, embarrassed, humiliated and de-trousered in public. At the Gates themselves should undergo similar punishments for betraying what they originally accomplished.\n\nPrior to this sub-mediocre record, At the Gates pursued musical excellence. They didn\u2019t settle for streamlined rock \u2018n\u2019 roll songs. They wrote what can be considered the most compositionally ambitious batch of songs in the history of death metal. Not only that, they were also artistically relevant. On Slaughter of the Soul, they apparently \u201cmatured\u201d; meaning they figured that the best way to attract a metal audience is to write ultra-simple, easy to understand collection of songs. Gone are the complex compositions of old and along with any integrity. Gone is the ambitious attitude behind the beautifully chaotic masterwork: The Red in the Sky is Ours. In its place now stands the anti-metal position of \u201cOh, let\u2019s just make music that every metal head can enjoy!\u201d\n\nBearing that train of thought in mind, At the Gates crafted an absolutely mediocre album. It\u2019s impossible to see why the hell people praise this crap. The band members are not particularly adept at their instruments, the songwriting is half assed, and the riffs are watered down thrash riffs. So what the hell is there worth praising?\n\nThere is only \u201ccatchy and \u201cmemorable\u201d melodies; the same type that permeate many a pop band to be found here. Technicality-wise, the work featured here is not all that impressive. The guitar riffs are nothing more than straight thrashing that require nigh average ability. The riffs themselves consist of tremolo picking with basic melodies. Perhaps these riffs would be interesting if the notes chosen created some viable contrast, but that is not the case. Instead, each melody is awash in sappy sentimentality and cutesy stabs at novelty that it is difficult to take seriously. The drums and bass follow suit; absolutely average 1+2+1+2 rhythms played right behind the guitars. Maybe the musicianship would be more impressive if this was released twelve years before. Obviously, that is not the case. By around, or even before 1995, there were already many bands displaying a level of musicianship far greater than Slaughter of the Soul. Including, but not limited to, Atheist, Morbid Angel, Cryptopsy, Suffocation and earlier At the Gates (That\u2019s Right!).\n\nPerhaps the musicianship shouldn\u2019t be taken so seriously. After all, many artists proved themselves worthy by overcoming instrumental deficiencies with powerful songwriting. Unfortunately, no such powerful songwriting is present anywhere on this album. The listener is instead treated to unspectacular rock \u2018n\u2019 roll arrangements that do little to deviate from traditional verse/chorus/repeat/bridge/verse/chorus structures, and much less innovate. The songwriting contains nothing more than catchy melodies carried by predictable, cyclical arrangements. This is also the same formula utilized by pop artists. Needless to say, there were plenty of bands at the time that dabbled in more complex compositions; including, but not limited to, Emperor, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Darkthrone, and Early At the Gates (That\u2019s right!).\n\nSlaughter of the Soul is a completely watered down version of At the Gates. Avoid it at all costs. There are far much better creations in the realm of metal. It is clear that At the Gates created this for the sole purpose of making safe, accessible, and inoffensive metal in order to garner more fans from the scene. Call it \u2018light\u2019 metal if you will. Or how about, At the Gates in light flavor! It\u2019s At the Gates with all the distortion and aggression, but none of the challenging thinking required to comprehend it! Whatever you want to call it, I call it \u2018Crap in the middle of the road.\u201d\n",
        "\nIn 1996, one of the worst moments in Metal history occurred: the juggernaut Melodic Death Metal band At the Gates disbanded. After 5 tours in one year, irreconcilable differences caused the members to pick up their instruments and go their own way. If I knew who they were then (I was only 8 at the time), I would\u2019ve cried. \n\nKnown for creating the \u201cNew Wave of Swedish Death Metal\u201d scene (or typically known as \u201cGothenburg Death Metal\u201d), At the Gates pioneered the sound by mixing the brutal tones of thrash with the melody that was found in the death metal scene of Gothenburg, Sweden. Hence, they created \u201cGothenburg Death Metal\u201d: A heavy blend of ferocious riffs that had the calming of melody intertwined within them. \n\nAfter an EP and two albums which gained them little attention (they were still homing in on their trademark sound), they sent shockwaves throughout the Metal scene with \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d, which showed the band on the brink of something truly astounding, revolutionary, and inspiring. And while they certainly achieved that on their follow-up \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d, that doesn\u2019t mean that \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d should just be considered a warm-up. It\u2019s a bit more technical, and just as brutal and melodic as its successor.\n\nHaunting, bone-chilling, and irresistibly beautiful - those are the words that come to mind from opening notes of \u201cThe Swarm\u201d. A cello/violin duo creates a sea of melancholy, in which the listener is forced to dive into. It\u2019s only a matter of seconds before the first riff lands a solid right into your jaw, and slams you into the ground. Here you get the first taste of the rabid vocalist Tomas Lindberg, whose frothing voice is a legend among the Metal community. He puts so much emotion into his work that it sounds as if every vein in his depraved body is about to erupt. And combine that with the infatuating duel between serenity and discord that the guitarists Bj\u00f6rler and Larsson create, and your mind will be overdriven with emotion. This whole act is carried on throughout the rest of the album. The deranged title track is throttled forward by Lindberg\u2019s malicious voice and death-embracing riffs, while others like \u201cForever Blind\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Wound\u201d will leave you shaking from the coexistence of aggression and equanimity. And passing up on the gorgeous and unexpected acoustic/cello themed \u201cAnd the World Returned\u201d should be punishable by death.\n\n\u201cA dead nation under one dead god\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not so much that you\u2019ll be immersed into a new world of Gothenburg, but it\u2019s the fact that these artists are nearly flawless in everything that they do. Lindberg is one of the most mesmerizing vocalists one will ever come across. While he doesn\u2019t have much variation in his vocal works, he doesn\u2019t need to. He perfectly suits the guitars throughout the whole album, and by the time a song is finished, you\u2019d believe he literally has nothing else to give. His vocal efforts on \u201cForever Blind\u201d are like watching a man fight for his very own existence, knowing that if he doesn\u2019t put it all out now, he never will. Listening to him snarl \u201cWe have lost our faith in our own creativity. What is evil, but good, Tortured by its own hunger and thirst?\u201d will provoke your mind. He seems to have the attitude that every song he does is his last performance ever, and he strains his body to unmatchable limits. Such passion is rare, but it\u2019s even mirrored by Bj\u00f6rler and Larsson. This classic duo flicks out some of the most creative riffs the Metal community has ever, and will ever see. \u201cThe Beautiful Wound\u201d and \u201cThe Swarm\u201d are stunning achievements no matter how you look at them. And not only can they write riffs, but they can solo as if their life depended on it. \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d easily walks away with the most impressive solo on the album, as Bj\u00f6rler rips through melodic note after note. \n\nIf anything were to hamper the dark experience presented by this album, it would be the actual amount of songs. You\u2019re given a meager 6 tracks, and then 3 live tracks. While all three lives tracks are astonishing (\u201cAll Life Ends\u201d, \u201cThe Burning Darkness\u201d, and \u201cKingdom Gone\u201d), you\u2019ll be so busy devouring the actual tracks that you\u2019ll never pay attention to them. I'll stand firm with my belief that if this just had 4 more tracks, it would stand equal to \"Slaughter of the Soul\". But also, out of the 6 real tracks you are given, \u201cThe Fevered Circle\u201d lacks any replay value. While it\u2019s certainly not a horrible track, the other 5 are so sensational that it will just leave you disappointed.\n\nIf ever there was a band that I wished would come back, it would be At the Gates. And while \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d might not be as ground breaking as \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d, it still deserves more than your respect. With 5 songs of pure bliss, and one mediocre one, this demands to be in every Metal fans album collection. For these musicians are true masters of their craft, and \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d stands as monument to them.\n\nOverall \u2013 4/5 (80)\n\nRecommended Tracks\nThe Swarm\nTerminal Spirit Disease\nForever Blind\n",
        "\nWhen was the last time you could recall staring at the face of hostility, only to be perplexed by the beauty surrounding it? It\u2019s hard really to even conceive such a thought, since those two hardly go hand in hand. But maybe some of us have never been in a situation like that before, and therefore can\u2019t comprehend it as well as another might. For instance, my father, who served in Vietnam, told me about a time that his base was under mortar fire. In-between the mortar rounds and explosions, he claimed that smoke mixed with the morning Vietnamese sun to create an inexplicable surrounding.\n\nBut At the Gates seemed to master this effect flawlessly.\n\n\u201cWe are blind to the world within us\u2026waiting to be born\u201d\n\nAfter 32 seconds of industrial noise and effects, those chilling words are passionately and calmly spoken on \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d before you\u2019re taken down the path of lunacy and depravity. This deranged portrait of life is known as \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d, and you\u2019re stepping square into its asylum. Tomas Lindberg\u2019s seething vocals mixed with Larsson and Bj\u00f6rler\u2019s vindictive riffs are enough to make you collapse to the floor. However, with every lyric sung, every riff that is played, there is an undisputed presence of touching melody. The wonderful euphony of \u201cUnder a Serpent Sun\u201d is more than a confession to the power of melody that these musicians posses. It\u2019s no question that brutality and grace exist in harmony here, but it\u2019s the brutal aspect that could be the selling points at critical moments. The title track is one of the most rip-roaring tracks on this album, complete with frothing vocals and searing guitars. And composing of one of the most ingenious audio clips ever used, \u201cSuicide Nation\u201d will send a chilling message within the first second as the sound of a shotgun being loaded is blasted into the speakers, only to be followed by maliciously crunched riffs. \n\n\u201cChildren born of sin, tear your soul apart!\u201d\n\nOn past albums, Lindberg had a bit more of \u201cDeath Growl\u201d, and was certainly deeper. On here, however, his voice is a bit more rasped and stretched, making him seem even more desperate. And when Lindberg snarls, you know his giving it his all. He aims to leave his body void of all energy after every song, and it\u2019s a wonder he got through a whole album with death by the cause of exhaustion. After listening to him put his body to the test on \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d, he continues on his impressive performance throughout the whole album, notably again on \u201cCold\u201d and \u201cWorld of Lies\u201d. Listening to him bark out \u201cSuicide - jaws locked around your spine\u201d on \"Suicide Nation\" will leave the vision of a man stripped of all hope. \n\nCombine Lindberg with the experience of the guitar work, and a whole new world is opened. From the unrelenting \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d to the acoustic based \u201cInto the Dead Sky\u201d, Larsson and Bj\u00f6rler effortlessly put forth one of the most stunningly unique Metal albums. While the riffs they fire off on this album are a bit simpler and straight-forward than their past releases, they feel more completely written and thought out. And their solos, while short, are nicotine to the ear. \u201cCold\u201d features a striking use of effects blended in with raw talent to envelop the listener and stamp its mark on the song. \n\nWhile the work here is truly breathtaking, there are a few blemishes. For starters, since this isn\u2019t as technical as their past releases, some of these songs border on being ripped off one another. This surely isn\u2019t a problem in the beginning with the first 7 songs being completely distinguishable, but the last few, like \u201cNausea\u201d and \u201cUnto Others\u201d, are hard to tell apart. And that being said, \u201cNausea\u201d is probably the blandest track on here, as it becomes borderline hardcore punk with its overly simple riff base. And besides a shining moment on \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d, the bass is still virtually non-existent. However, to cancel that out, Adrian Erlandsson does a phenomenal job on his drum parts. While it\u2019s not anything that will drop your jaw, it\u2019s more than solid. Adrian performs with pin-point precession, and never misses a beat. \n\nThis was the last album by At the Gates, and what a way to leave. The compassionate mix of brutality and melody that they created on \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d has still yet to be matched within the Gothenburg genre. And besides a few hiccups here and there, this is their masterpiece. If you call yourself any kind of a metal head, I can\u2019t stress to you enough how much you need this album.\n\nOverall \u2013 4.5/5 (92)\n\nRecommended Tracks\nBlinded by Fear\nSlaughter of the Soul\nUnder a Serpent Sun\nSuicide Nation\n\n*For a better summary than the last real paragraph above, please obtain the track \"Suicide Nation\" and listen to the first second. Thank you.\n",
        "\nThe seminal masters of melodic death metal return on their second album with a dark and dynamic portrayal of the soul that goes beyond good and evil to find only pain and sufferign, but derives a sense of beauty from it. This is a graphic journey that can rouse the most apathetic. \nA rebellious yet thoughtful restlessness dictates the flow of the music according to the focus of each song - the emotion and dynamic of each passage - subjecting it to constant change. \nMelodies bounce off subordinate riffs that shape the eclectic yet logical structure of each song, varying in strength of tone and rhythm to highlight the melodic phrasing with greater emotional depth. \n\nThis interaction between guitars is very free and expressive, yet still tightly bound as the percussion and bass support the general mood and motion of the riffs. \n\nPreviously, this slow-witted listener found himself lost within a perpetual change of riffs that seemed incoherent and disparate, but patience revealed that the more experimental edge that pervades this album underscores every change of riff, tone and tempo with the emotional unease that finally made it such a poignant work. \n\nAt the same time, it's a death metal album that sounds the closest to classical music yet, and it is to the great credit of the artists that they seem to have left no combination unexplored in the persuit of an atmosphere that immerses the listener in the richness of their poetry.\n",
        "\nAt the Gates is a band that started with a typical death metal sound but then they moved forward to a new kind of death metal that sounded more melodic, therefore plenty of people hated them and many others loved them. Most of the people who enjoyed this new version of death metal were actually melodic metal fans, in contrast to the extreme old school death metal audience that disliked this new style. \n\nWith this said I will just have to mention that \u201cTerminal Spirit Disease\u201d is in the middle of both styles, showing songs of the new era of the band but also showing live songs of their old sound. People who enjoyed both, old and new era of At the Gates, are usually satisfied about this album, and it actually sounds like a prelude of their later album \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of the album are the vocals\u2026 nothing more than high toned grunts and screams of pain and desperation, they are kinda in the way of Children of Bodom\u2019s vocals. The guitar riffs are actually interesting, they seem to switch between death metal figures to harmonized riffs and melodic chords. The drumming also has this switching, they use blast beat but suddenly the drums use a standard double bass riff that doesn\u2019t sound tough or aggressive.\n\nThe first song \u201cThe Swarm\u201d has quite an atmospheric intro that includes string classical instruments, after a few seconds you realize that is only an intro and that the band is a blast. The first guitar riff is quite harmonized but for the verse changes to a deathish figure and the chorus has catchy music, except for the voice. As a melodic death metal fan I recommend this song and also \u201cForever Blind\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Wound\u201d. There\u00b4s also an instrumental acoustic intermission \u201cAnd the World Returned\u201d, this kind of instrumentals are typical in melodic death metal albums, bands like In Flames and Dark Tranquillity included this kind of instrumentals in their own albums as a direct influence of At the Gates.\n\nAs for the three live songs included in the album, they don\u2019t sound melodic, as I mentioned before but the quality of the recording is quite good and it gives you the opportunity to realize how At the Gates sounded before evolving to the melodic sound. I recommend this album mainly to the people who enjoyed \u201cSlaughter of the Soul\u201d.\n",
        "\nThere is an obvious dividing line in the opinions about At The Gates' classic album 'Slaughter Of The Soul'. Many people hail it as one of the few Swedish melodic Death Metal classics, but many At The Gates fans consider this album as an attempt to be too accessible. Let me point out, before I get to my own opinion, that both groups are right. 'Slaughter Of The Soul' is in deed much more melodic and accessible than anything At The Gates has ever done before, but that is exactly why I like this album so much. The debut album 'The Red In The Sky Is Ours' is just too noisy for me. That is the strongest division between \"old\" At The Gates and this album: the older albums are really melodic Death Metal, while 'Slaughter Of The Soul' has a lot of influences from the Thrash field and the likes of Iron Maiden. And those Thrash influences make this album an enjoyable one for me. Almost every riff you hear could, in a slightly less melodic form, have been on a Slayer album.\n\nSo what do we have here? The album starts out in the right way with 'Blinded By Fear'. The video to that song was basically my first introduction to At The Gates (forgive me, I was born in 1986) and I liked it right away. As much as I despise grunts and screams, Tomas Lindberg had something different, a more versatile grunt, which gave this song the right atmosphere. Things I loved right away as well were the guitar sound and the drumming. Plus, that main riff to 'Blinded By Fear' is just amazing!\n\nThe album continues in the same vein with the title track, which might just be even better and the same line is continued throughout most of the songs, which is my only complaint about the album; it could have used a little more variation.\n\nPersonal highlights include 'Blinded By Fear', the title track, the absolutely amazing 'Suicide Nation', the \"slower\" (which in case of At The Gates means moderately fast) 'World Of Lies' and that nifty opening riff to 'Under A Serpent Sun'. Another nice thing on the album is Andy LaRoque's guest guitar solo on the track 'Cold'. While not being one of Andy's best, it's definitely the most memorable solo on the album. It fits the song quite well; 'Cold' is one of the more melodic tracks on the album and really breathes a desperate atmosphere.\n\n'Into The Dead Sky' is one of the few non-Metal moments on the album. It's a tranquil instrumental and I've always quite liked those. Especially on albums of Swedish bands. There's something with the way Swedes play the acoustic guitar...maybe it's just their musical tradition, but somehow, there's always wonderful melodies coming out of an acoustic guitar played by a Swede... The other non-Metal track is the closing instrumental 'Flames Of The End', which is a really, really strange one. It's an experimental, soundtrack-ish mood that sets the tension for something which is never to come. It sets a climax for something that just isn't there. Even though it is a good track quality wise, I think it's in the wrong place on the album.\n\nAfter that, if you have the remastered version, there is a handful of completely useless bonus tracks. Among those, there are demos of two album tracks ('Unto Others' and 'Suicide Nation') which are vastly inferior to the album versions, if only because the tuning is different. The cover songs aren't that good as well, but something I have to note with that is that I hate cover tracks, so maybe some of you will like them.\n\n'Slaughter Of The Soul' is an amazing Thrash album with just the right amounts of melody and aggression. I never cared much for terms as \"classics\" or \"milestones\", but when it was up to me, both would fit this album very well. Not one of the musicians did anything better before or after the album.\n",
        "\nThis is the album responsible for inciting a musical movement called The New Wave of Swedish Death Metal a.k.a. Melodeath, more so than The Gallery, Jester Race, or any other album out there. The melodic, yet crushing sound have become the signature of Gothenburg bands. The album has reached its influences into broad areas of rock/metal music, especially with American bands like Shadows Fall, Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, etc. etc.\n\nHowever, on the other end of the spectrum, this album is vilified and scorned by metal purists, claiming that the band has sold out from its original sound to create this pop-structured album. This album single-handedly produced a stream of copycats that has diluted the metal scene, which eventually destroyed the movement the band once owned.\n\nNow, everybody has their own opinion about this album. But as far as I\u2019m concerned, Slaughter of the Soul is simply one of the better albums released in the 90\u2019s, one of the best guitar-oriented Metal albums ever, and easily one of the most influential albums in the current wave of Metal music. At the same time, Slaughter of the Soul is a flawed album that shows flashes of brilliance, only to leave listeners ultimately unsatisfied.\n\nThe songs are typified by an in-your-face attack, heralded by the sterling guitar work, a mix between brutal Death Metal and the vigor of Power Metal, and tight, active rhythm section. The vocals are a mix of Hardcore shouts and Black Metal screams. The album is appropriately produced by Fredrik Nordstrom, notable for his guitar-heavy recordings.\n\nThe guitars really stand out in this album, production-wise, as well as song-wise. Slaughter of the Soul boasts some of the most visceral riffs in metal music. \u2018Cold\u2019, \u2018Suicide Nation\u2019, and \u2018World of Lies\u2019 contain creative and powerful guitar lines with loads of melody that makes the music whistle-able, ala Heartwork.\n\nIn \u2018Cold\u2019, At the Gates has crafted a timeless Metal classic that will surely stand the test of time. The crushing intro which leads to the lurching mid-tempo riff is the stuff made for headbanging. The off-kilter bridge riff and the serene acoustic part, leading back to the bridge with an overlaying short, but sweet lead is excellent. And the chorus is damn infectious. A must hear for any Metal fans.\n\nHowever, the problem with the album is that most of the songs follow a verse-chorus-lead formula that becomes predictable as the album wears on, which renders them easily digestible. The songs have the tendency to be powerful and memorable at one point, but after repeated listens, they lose their luster and impact. Another gripe with the album is that the band recycles chord progressions heard on previous songs. Nevertheless, this doesn\u2019t discount the songs from its greatness, since all of them are performed with venomous intensity and urgency.\n\nOverall, despite its shortcomings, Slaughter of the Soul is still highly recommended. My suggestion: buy the album, and make your opinion about it.\n",
        "\nWhen one thinks about the creation and evolution of the melodic death metal sound, it really comes down to three bands: Carcass, At the Gates, and In Flames. Sure, in the early 90\u2019s Entombed set the stage with their pioneering death & roll landmark Wolverine Blues, and Sepultura was busy reshaping death in its own proudly South American image, but these bands only opened the door; they never stepped through. Carcass brought the big hooks and the basic concept, At the Gates presented us with a new and exciting guitar tuning and the roots of the melodeath style, and In Flames\u2026 well, they really really liked Iron Maiden.\n\nSlaughter of the Soul is really the first fully realized expression of melodic death metal\u2019s potential, Heartwork for all its innovation still being defiantly underground at heart. This is the first death metal record where you get a sense of this potentially being mainstream, this sensation that this could become a new brand name in metal. I mean, previous to this only Cannibal Corpse and a handful of other Floridian mooks had made inroads on commercial success, but they were still creating too much of a racket with their Jurassic-era spoo. At the Gates, on the other hand, have some of what made Def Leppard stand out from the NWOBHM or Metallica from the rest of the thrashers, this sort of verve and confidence, an eye cocked toward the prize. Starting from this point, they became a separate entity from their shaggy, frostbitten contemporaries like Dark Tranquillity and Dissection and (after their break-up) began collecting the dues and boos that all innovators receive.\n\nThe really fun thing about picking up a record like this is that you get to hear both the ideas everybody and their bearded sun-fearing mothers cribbed and the ideas that were left behind, other paths that remain unexplored (see Priest\u2019s first five records for tons of these). It seems a rule of thumb that almost all innovative bands are composed of players who refuse to sit still and play their music straight. Sometimes that means that their derivatives will reap the success, and other times it means that the watershed record will forever be held up as a superior piece of art. ATG falls somewhere in the middle of this range.\n\nSlaughter of the Soul\u2019s stunning guitar tone and garbled but intelligible caws are undoubtedly at the foundation of the modern sound, but the really cool thing is how much more variance you\u2019ll find here than in the average Darkane record. The music is based much more strongly upon speed and thrash metal than death metal (truth be told, there\u2019s hardly any death to speak of), with all sorts of black and Soundgarden and Pantera stuff overtop. The highly distorted guitars add the mechanized crunch that\u2019s become so familiar through the works of Hypocrisy and The Crown, while the slightly more shrieky than usual vocals point towards the likes of Children of Bodom and Old Man\u2019s Child. It\u2019s a perfect example of how the initial influences of a form of music are slowly strained out with each successive imitation, the highly apparent Reign in Blood song structures and claustrophobic riffing disappearing in the successive generation just as Diamond Head\u2019s overt Zeppelin affection was so mercilessly purged by Metallica and Megadeth.\n\nThe songs here are for the most part very short and to the point, four songs (if you subtract the long-ish intro to \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d) clocking in at under three minutes. With the exception of the two instrumentals, each song seems calculated to get the pit moshing hard but smooth, the band wisely scraping away the more complex elements of thrash and glaring with a laser-eyed focus on the straight-forward \u2018bang thy head\u2019 riffery with an occasional Carcassian swinging hook to mix things up, dangling like a booger before the band sneezes out a compact flurry of riffage to segue back into the main thrust of the song.\n\nThe main problem with this is that many of the songs (particularly in the first half of the record) tend to blur together in one\u2019s mind if they aren\u2019t the \u2018hits\u2019 like \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d or \u201cSuicide Nation\u201d. The album is also far too angsty for its own good, too much \u2018nobody cares about meeeeee\u2019 too little of the supposed philosophy the liners ramble about. Also, Tomas Lindberg may have discovered a new vocal style on this LP, but he also discovers the greatest weakness it has: it sounds like crap when it doesn\u2019t have riffs under it. In \u201cCold\u201d there is a break where he basically sits there screaming about how nobody loves him and, while I refuse to use the analogy most any other reviewer here would use, once you hear it described as such you can\u2019t help but think of Tomas gargling back some of the white stuff while getting his angst on. Furthermore, the acoustic instrumental is beyond basic and the MIDI-sounding \u201cThe Flames of the End\u201d wouldn\u2019t sound out of place on the next Shadow of Death demo.\n\nStill, the album is saved from the terrifying fate of the OVERRATED stamp by the nastier backwash that awaits on the latter half of the album, At the Gates apparently having satisfied their commercial jones and ready to show off the ugly, harsh side of their new baby boy, \u201cWorld of Lies\u201d kicking off a four-song blitzkrieg of neo-thrash with enough vitriol to strip the paint off of the walls. Three of the four are total Slayer worship, \u201cUnto Others\u201d in particular being a really mean piece of business, the sound of angry robots playing Tormentor while \u201cNeed\u201d beats absolutely everyone to the \u2018gothic Gothenburg\u2019 punch.\n\nOverall, I recommend this record to anyone who likes the less ornate Gothenburg bands out there, and for those thrash-heads who don\u2019t mind that the tuning is slightly different and can tolerate the vocals of bands like Children of Bodom. I also have to say, in the strongest words possible, that anyone with a \u2018scholarly\u2019 interest in the evolution of heavy metal must hear this record at least five or six times in order to understand melodic death. For the rest of you out there, you won\u2019t find many easier headbangs.\n\nA word about the reissue: it adds six fine tracks including extremely intense covers of Slaughterlord and Slayer and a ballsy unreleased cut called \u201cThe Dying\u201d. Some of this stuff is actually better than what you\u2019ll find on the album proper. \n\nStand-Out Tracks: \u201cUnto Others\u201d, \u201cBlinded by Fear\u201d, \u201cNausea\u201d\n",
        "\nMore often than not, when someone hears the name At the Gates, the first thing they think of is \"Slaughter of the Soul!!!!\". So large was that album's impact on the current melodic death and metalcore scenes that it often seems the rest of the At The Gates discography is totally ignored. Thankfully, more seasoned metal fans recognize the brilliance of the works that came before.\n\nWhen I first purchased \"The Red in the Sky Is Ours\" over a year ago, I was expecting a fairly controlled melodic death attack, not too far off from SotS, just a tad more complex and not as cleanly produced. What I received was a whirlwind of seemingly disorganized drumming,oddly harmonized but well composed guitar work, a powerful but harsh sounding production, and song structures that could change dramatically every 20 seconds. I was also surprised to hear a violin pop up every now and then. A nice touch, but definitely not what a person who had only heard Slaughter of the Soul would expect. Surprisingly, I was not immediately put off by this album, but instead intrigued. I listened many more times in attempt to understand the intricacies and beauty underneath a fairly oppressive surface.\n\nEventually, all the songs here began to make complete sense, despite all the rhythmic and thematic changes. Although I would typically find the random use of violins to be gimmicky, it is used so sparingly here, usually to accent one of the more controlled melodic sections, such as the ending of \"Within\". Still, one could see this as unnecessary.\n\nWhat The Red in the Sky Is Ours gives us is a look at what melodic death metal should be. Make no mistake, the melodic qualities present on Slaughter of the Soul are also here, only constructed in a much more progressive (as opposed to circular) manner. Rhythmically, it is heavy enough to still be called death metal, as opposed to \"Iron Maiden with laryngitis\".\n\nThere are no real standout tracks, as nearly all songs except \"The Scar\" are in the same vein. My favorites include the concert favorite \"Kingdom Gone\", the melodic \"Within\" and \"Windows\", and the sheer ferocity of the closing track, \"City of Screaming Statues\".\n\nSo why not 100%? The musicianship, while very impressive overall, can sometimes be hit or miss as far as timing goes (such as a drum fill that goes on for a second too long), but as long as you don't have a metronome branded in your brain, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Some parts within songs just seem like they had more effort put into them than others. Some may find issue with the production, but as long as you're not obsessed with overglossed Killswitch Engage styled recording, it shouldn't be an issue. To the untrained ear, The Red in the Sky is Ours can also be off-putting, which may explain why this album (and its counterpart, the subsequent With Fear I Kiss The Burning Darkness) are mostly ignored.\n\nIf you are interested in hearing melodic death metal played the right way, progressive, complex, and heavy, I highly recommend this album as a starting point. An underrated classic without a doubt.\n",
        "\nUpon hearing the first bits of The Red in the Sky is Ours, you know this album is going to completely annihilate your sorry ass. It's classic death metal, you listen to it and you know this wasn't a fluke of a band. Their albums got steadily less brutal, but were great releases on their own merit.\n\nAs for the songs on this album, what can I say? The title track just completely blew me away, and the violin parts just adds that odd contrast that many Swedish bands love to do (and I love to hear). The other songs that really stood out to me (which means, made me stop and look at the song number and name) were Kingdom Gone, Within (godly GODLY intro), and The Scar. The rest of the songs were very well made on their own right. Tomas' vocals are great, some of the best death metal vocals I've heard in a long time, and like said before, Jesper's violin is just great. Adrian's drumming is godly, they drive the songs on very well. \n\nThe digipack came with two live tracks and a demo, and those are worthwhile as well. Ever-Opening Flower was just great, and I had to keep listening to it because it just sounds amazing. If you hate the 'Gothenburg' scene, I guarantee you that this is an album for you, because it's death metal all the way.\n",
        "\nThis is very different from what At the Gates would become, but you can still tell that its the same band. I really love this record, even though its only four songs. Its definately worth getting. What is different about this EP is that the band's black metal roots are more obvious, along with a slight doom influence as well. The vocals are their most brutal in my opinion, as they are growls instead of high pitched screems. The guitars are not as melodic as they would one day become, but they are still really good. The druming is pretty much the same as later material. What stands out most to me is that this release is much darker and more evil sounding than any of their later records. I dont quite know how to describe it, but the vocals, lyrics and riffing are really dark and mysterious. The lyrics are really philosophical on this record and the vocals match them some how. The guitars add are really evil atmosphere and so do the keyboards, which appear only to create a mysterious vibe at the begining of some songs. I really love old death metal, and this is certainly death metal, but really unique, nothing else sounds like this.\n",
        "\nApparently At the Gates \u201cgot bored\u201d with their formerly complex and technical style of death metal, or they \u201cprogressed beyond\u201d writing structurally difficult music, or they finally figured out that \u201cthe most powerful songs are the most direct ones\u201d. You know the drill; you\u2019ve heard it from other bands. As of this album (their final one) they just want to rock out and play some catchy music, and hey, who can blame them? They paid their dues, and I\u2019m sure they had bills to worry about; who are we to judge them\u2026 uh, right? \n\nAnyway, what we have here is the sound of older Swedish death metal crossbreeding itself back into rock music \u2013 franticly fast, hard rock-influenced riffing and scream-a-long vocals over basic thrash drumming. Fast, aggressive ear candy, basically. Indeed, when a death metal band's vocalist starts interjecting \"yeah\" and \"do it\" into songs, you might as well say farewell. If you\u2019ve heard pretty much any heavily hyped release by a Swedish band to come out in the past several years, very little description should be necessary, because this thing\u2019s fingerprints are all over what\u2019s currently passed off as \u201cmelodic death metal\u201d. \n\nNone of this is really brilliant, but now and again it\u2019s at least as catchy and memorable as it\u2019s trying to be, like on the first two tracks and \u201cWorld of Lies\u201d. Most of the rest of the album is kind of a blur, though, and as a whole it's woefully unambitious and not really worth the time it takes to sit through, not when there\u2019s so much really good metal out there.\n\nNice guitar tone, though.\n",
        "\nThis was the first At The Gates album I bought. When I first bought this album, I almost listened to the entire CD the first day. This album features some melodic guitar work, which I think is really good. I also like the straight forward riffs as well. The intro of The Swarm is pretty cool. Not every death metal uses a violin in their songs. I think what At The Gates did was original. If you make someone listen to this song without knowing who the band is, they make think it's just some violin piece or whatever. They will be really surprised to listen what comes after that. \n\nThe title track is the best one in my opinion. Tomas Lindberg is a really powerful vocalist. He uses his vocals really well on this song. I like that scream he does around the 1:40 mark of the song. The drumming from Adrian Erlandsson is excellent on that song as well.\n\nAnd The World Returned is a pretty interesting instrumental track. It sounds a little eerie, but that's what makes it good.\n\nAs for the rest of the songs, they got their good points. I really like the fact that they put live tracks on this album. The quality of these live tracks are really excellent, in my opinion. Kingdom Gone sounds extremely good live. It is the longest track on the whole album. All of the live songs are classic At The Gate songs, especially All Life Ends and The Burning Darkness. They sound better live than in the studio.\n",
        "\nSo imagine if The Haunted actually threw in more than one thrash riff per career, and didn't have that idiot of a hardcore barker doing vocals... well, you'd get this album. This is pretty much staple Gothenburg death metal, with some decent riffage every once in a while... unfortunately every once in a while it succumbs to the absolute wretched dynamic excesses that make Dark Tranquillity and the other mainstays of the genre so unlistenable. These two cardinal sins are: a) Drop the guitars and make the vocals the main point of the song, and 2) lots of overlong noodling without real riff intensity. \n\nThe first two songs are straightforward and solid, with even a nice thrash riff in Blinded by Fear popping up - then Cold is where the album reveals its true \"melodic\" character... there's the silly acoustic passage around 1.45 and then the solo over the really fucking boring midpaced riff right after that. Then, the end of Under a Serpent Sun has the vocals interlude. Yeah, if you like Gothenburg, you'll like this one. \n\nThen there's the dumb interlude \"Into a Dead Sky\", which then returns us to the \"usual\" sound of fast not-quite-thrash riffage of Suicide Nation. The Haunted fans, listen up... this is your album right here. The song gets better as it goes on, but it is still very repetitive. Suicide, suicide, suicide.... great.\n\nThe good parts of the album - decent solos and when they have fast riffs underneath they are quite enjoyable, it is the midpaced wankery that really sucks, and man these guys are good at that too - apparently to graduate from Gothenburg University you have to take a degree in that. Even the fast songs kinda blend into each other - the verse sections are completely interchangeable.\n\nBut hey, it's a massive step up over previous At the Gates, which was just absurdly bad.\n",
        "\nThis really sums up the modern metal ethic of \"so many ideas, so little time\". There is hardly any room for coherent riffage when one throws in a billion drum passages and a thousand mood changes without letting any of them really sink in. Add to that the fact that the album is fundamentally BORING, and we have some major problems.\n\nJust listen to the first song - Beyond Good and Evil... there is one basic death-metal riff to start things off, and under that, the drummer can't really decide what he is doing, but it ends up distracting from the music. Then, around 0.37 there is a different riff, which also just lacks catchiness and any sense of groove - it's too hard to headbang when half the notes seem to be out of time. \n\nThe rest... for the most part that sums it up - Raped by the Light has some okay groove riffs, except then there is the annoying habit of the main guitar to cut out and then only the left-channel guitar to continue - very disconcerting. The album has lots of silly stop-breaks like that. Stop, then continue. The Break of Autumn has just about the only memorable riff of the album, and it sounds like a Pantera reject riff... it occurs around 2.36 and stays for about 11 seconds before disintegrating in a flurry of misplaced drum hits.\n\nFor the most part, it sounds like they're playing the same riff a lot of the time - it's some high-pitched fast riffing that lacks a solid headbanging basis. It sounds more like a bit of a solo picked out and repeated, and not an actual riff. Tony Iommi is not pleased. \n\nStar Drowned has a decent intro, though the guitars sound slightly out of sync, and the problem is heightened when the drums come in. Then the song disintegrates completely into the same old crap as before.\n\nIt's hard to describe what this album is... imagine one basic death-metal riff, pitch-shifted up an octave, given about 80 trivial permutations, and then scattered about for 40 minutes. That's the guitar characteristic of the album. Then throw in some over-prominent drumming, some annoying distorted vocals at times, and in general this doesn't hold my attention for longer than 3 seconds at a time. When they very rarely catch on to a decent idea, they immediately let it go. It's fascinating, how the album macroscopically sounds the same over 40 minutes, but there isn't 15 consecutive seconds that follow any discernable pattern. \n\nOh yeah, throw in just about the worst guitar tone ever - very weak, again as I said it sounds pitch-shifted. No memorable riffs. Man this makes In Flames sound brilliant, and that's saying much.\n",
        "\nIt's always a shame to see a band break up, and it's even more a shame when the band that breaks up is so damn good. Sadly, nothing can get At The Gates back together, but that didn't stop the Earache label from rereleasing the band's swansong, Slaughter of the Soul with some new tracks and unreleased material that makes one of the best melodic death metal albums even better.\n\nSlaughter of the Soul finds the band at their peak form; guitarists Anders Bjoler and Martin Larsson trading off brutal riffs and excellent rhythm guitar, drummer Adrian Erlandsson showing off some excellent alternating patterns (that he still uses in Cradle of Filth), and vocalist Tomas Lindberg providing some excellent growling that is heavy, but clear enough that you can hear the rather excellent lyrics.\n\nThe re-release comes with liner notes by Tomas Lindberg, and although he offers a lot of interesting comments, it's clear that he dislikes some of the material on the album, and for the most part the tracks he dislikes aren't quite as original, or even as good as some of the standout tracks on the album. And like many melo-death albums, the potential for repetition does begin to set in after a short while, as a lot of the songs are structured similarly.\n\nBut Slaughter of the Soul is the best At the Gates album for a reason; everything is crisp, the production isn't too overblown, and the lyrics are quite good. There are a few bits of extremely original, almost Opeth-like breakdowns and mini-sections trying to get out during certain songs, but it's clear that the musical polish is when delivering the extremely refined melo-death sound. Under a Serpent Sun begins with some simple 4/4 riffing that shows holds for around twenty seconds before changing ever so slightly, a change that leads into an almost complete rhythm change as the song gets underway, alternating between these two sections with complete ease - and when the song breaks down into a brief spoken section underlined by some softer instrumentals, it really becomes apparent that the band knows what they're doing. Further proof of this is in the more concise title track, Slaughter of the Soul, which has a similar song structure but works with more efficiency at harmonizing guitar riffs, particularly during the guitar solo towards the end of the song. And anyone who hasn't heard the band's cover of Slayer's Captor of Sin needs to stop reading this review and download it immediately, as the band is talented enough with their rhythm guitar and overall speed to keep the thrash feel of original song while adding in their own subtle touch.\n\nSlaughter of the Soul is one of the best melo-death albums from one of the best melo-death bands in the genre's history, and although much of the new material on the re-release is cheap filler, there are at least a dozen jaw-dropping moments that display such chemistry, you'll wonder why At the Gates ever disbanded.\n"
