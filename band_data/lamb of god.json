        "\n'Ashes of the wake' made this band but 'As the palaces burn' officially put them on the map. This is where they found their identity, with any of the past material explorative at best. It's easy now to look back at this with snobby eyes, as about twenty years have gone by and plenty enough to be weary and then weary again, and again, by the obviousness of such a work. It needs to be said that when this came out, it was an exciting time for plenty of enthusiasts of the old thrash school of riffing as there was finally, at very least blooming from its premises, a second wave incarnation of that distinct Slayer style of razor-sharp, abrasive riffing based on chromatic patterns. This would be perfected on the following 'Ashes'; clearly Slayer-inspired, but not nearly like some common copycat, as they rather incorporated it into their own framework, into their own brand. There was real invention and a fresh stream of novelty spontaneously thrusting at the back of those tracks. There's undeniably also a strong Pantera influence in this, notably through the drum sound, the southern taint on the guitars and possibly some of the high-pitched screams pulled off here - although not on the inhale screaming (!).\n\nWhether this is one's cup of tea or not, it does contain deservedly iconic tracks 'Ruin', 'As the palaces burn', '11th hour' all sharing room in one same album. This arguably works against it though, in that it casts a shadow over the rest of the album and exposes its inconsistent quality distribution. 'For your malice' for example more or less serving as another iteration of '11th hour' if one takes it apart step by step. Is the rest of the album forgettable formulaic material ? Probably harsh, but not without some sense to it. 'A Devil In God's Country' would be a retort to that critique: here's a track later on the album with its own flavor, and a groove towards the end of it that was powerfully well contagious in 2003. But generally there are only so many combinations a guitarist could come up with using Slayeresque composition - although this is achieved in a much more balanced and memorable way throughout the whole of the following release.\n\nHere's a question to entertain: should Lamb of God be castigated for daring to blend an old school thrash base into a modern core-ish overall character and sound ? Those saying nay would bring up the positives of evolution in sound, and the intriguing innovations brought about. Those saying yea should likely point to the degradation of the artistic project that was originally carried out in the first wave, true to its endeavor of making provocative music to initiate a vivid reaction. Slayer were heavier for the 1980's than LOG were for 2003, right ? They sounded daring and revolutionary for music altogether. Not this album. Despite the effort to write intricate songs with fresh and new designs, an album like this may contribute to the general problem of the domestication of the wild metal beast. \n\nIts obvious willingness to be aggressive sounding, from a purely sound engineering standpoint: those sharp high mids on the guitars, that snappy snare, a bass guitar with lots of bite that weighs a ton (and that you can actually hear); also the band's choice to have a vocalist that screams almost all the time, so that constant attention requested by the ever-present, higher pitched voice; all this combines to shape a sound, a personality that might reveal itself to rely too much on its exterior edge, and less so in its center where most of the soul ought to come out from. There's a little bit of a victory of style over content here. Undeniably, however original at the time, this one can't compare to its successor that would right most of the wrongs palpable here: the epic 'Ashes of the wake', a full leap ahead in maturity, marvelous in its own unique way.\n",
        "\nThere are two huge elephants and one burning question in the room right now, so I'm gonna just tackle all three of them right off the bat, Lawrence Taylor style. \n\nELEPHANT #1: Chris Adler has been replaced by Art Cruz. This was actually the impetus of the previous seven reviews. It felt like the end of an era so I figured it was high time to revisit that era. Lamb of God was notable for having a rock solid lineup for over twenty years, something basically unheard of in metal, so Chris's departure was a huge shock to people who weren't paying attention. I say this because if you've paid attention to any interviews or behind-the-scenes material over the years you could tell he was clearly miserable and really felt constrained. I've been prophesying a breakup ever since Sacrament. It's been common knowledge for eons that Chris was the most talented member of the band as it was (like I've said before it's pretty rare in metal to find a drummer with an instantly recognizable style) and his frustration with the band's ever-safening songwriting was thinly veiled at best. So last year, he finally had enough and walked away before being replaced by Cruz (who I swore was previously the drummer in All Shall Perish until this very sentence when I double checked and realized it was actually my perennial punching bag Winds of Plague). So with all the background aside, the big question here is whether or not he holds up to Adler's dominant kit mastery. The answer is... yeah, actually. He was either playing way the fuck below his level in Winds of Plague or he's the Bruno Mars of metal and has a superhuman knack for replicating other peoples' signatures. If I hadn't known beforehand that Chris had left, I never would've known he wasn't on this album. His laser precision and ineffable groove is replicated with 100% authenticity here and I'm much more impressed than I expected to be.\n\nELEPHANT #2: They're on their eighth album and just now decided to roll with a self titled album. A lot of people feel the need to point this out it seems, simply because it's odd for a band to do this at any point after their debut, but to me this was actually a fucking huge red flag. Again reaching back to behind-the-scenes footage that I used to gobble up in high school, I distinctly remember that there was a disagreement between band members about what to name their upcoming album, and they were down to two choices: Sacrament or self titled. I could be misremembering because this is like a fifteen year old memory at this point but I recall Chris being the most vocally against a self titled album because he felt like it was a cop out and a sign that a band had run out of ideas. Considering the fact that I heard this exact same story for basically every following album, it's really not a surprise that they finally went and did it once he was unable to veto it. They've been rewriting Ashes of the Wake for ages now, even when the external circumstance of Randy's stint in prison gave them the perfect inspiration to branch out, so yeah I absolutely feel Chris's apprehension that the band feels like they've run out of ideas at this point. I know most bands who do this do it to either signal a reinvention of their sound or to declare that this is their definitive statement, but this simply isn't the band to be doing either of those things since pattern recognition tells me this next album might as well be Ashes of the Wake 4: Ash Free or Wake Hard. \n\nTHE BURNING QUESTION: Is Lamb of God any good? Do those two elephants stink up the joint as much as I and many fans expect them to?\n\n...No? I think? I'm still kinda reeling because everything signaled yet another mediocre snorefest and then somehow they spat out their best album since Wrath.\n\nThe weird thing is that this absolutely feels like yet another rehash of Ashes, but the majority of the songs just fuckin' bang this time around. I mentioned Cruz wound up being the perfect replacement for Adler, and honestly that makes me wonder if his mere presence reignited the rest of the guys' imagination. It's not like this drum performance would be any different with Adler. I've seen a lot of fans and reviews mention how Cruz is much more loose with his playing, but honestly I'm gonna make a sweeping claim and say that nearly everybody who says that is just taking Mark Morton at his word and aren't analyzing for themselves too closely. Yeah Mark told the media that he's a refreshing change because Chris played to a click track while Art doesn't so they feel more free on stage, but this has somehow morphed into \"Art is creative while Chris was a metronome\", which is both flatly untrue and totally irrelevant since he replicates his predecessor's style so perfectly. This is exactly as dialed-in and fully torqued as it always has been. \n\nThe reason Lamb of God succeeds while the last handful of albums failed despite essentially being the exact same idea is simply because most of these tracks take have the fire and energy of \"Laid to Rest\" and \"Desolation\" instead of their usual shtick of constantly rewriting \"11th Hour\" at varying speeds with increasingly diminishing returns. For the first time in a long while, they maintain whatever new ideas they have for the duration of the album instead of cramming them all into one song. \"Reality Bath\" opens with the first prominent bass part in their career, \"Routes\" is basically pure thrash metal (something they've always flirted with for a riff or two each album but never really went whole hog with it), \"Resurrection Man\" is basically a misplaced Slipknot song featuring Randy's best Architects impression with the opening BLEGH, throughout the entire runtime there are more solos and overt melody than they've ever really done, there are just tons of little touches of the creativity I thought they'd been fresh out of for a decade. Not all of these ideas hit bullseye (\"Resurrection Man\" is actually one of the worst tracks of the bunch) but it's nice to hear them branching out for a change.\n\nHowever, their previously crippling filler problem is still here to some extent. Lamb of God has always been a \"hit single\" type of band with only a couple of albums featuring any real deep cuts beyond the ones they play live constantly, and the self titled is the first to really break from that mold by having the singles be some of the weakest. \"Checkmate\" is exactly what I was afraid this album would be full of. It's a very LoG-by-numbers track that elicits exactly zero excitement in somebody like me who has been following them for almost their entire career and has grown very tired of them rehashing the same ideas over and over again. \"Gears\" suffers mostly the same problem, and it's hard to really describe because its biggest problem is simply that it's the type of song they've already written like fifty times. The breakdown riff would've been awesome if they didn't already use it in \"Contractor\", ya know? The lone outlier in this regard is the opener, \"Memento Mori\". I actually kinda hate the clean/spoken intro, but once the song picks up into familiar territory it plays out like any generic Lamb of God song would play out, but they... I dunno man they feel it this time. That's basically how I can describe any track here. They're still rewriting Ashes of the Wake over and over again but for the first time they've managed to do it in a way where it sounds lethal instead of focus tested. \"Reality Bath\" is basically \"The Faded Line\" by way of Slipknot but it sounds like they're really putting their hearts into it. \"On the Hook\" is \"Beating on Death's Door\" again but \"Beating on Death's Door\" is probably their most underappreciated track so hearing that type of high octane brutality again is a massive breath of fresh air. I mentioned that the previous album's guest vocalists felt like pointless gimmicks, and somehow the two this time are paradoxically more transparently gimmicky but also work a hell of a lot better. Jamey Jasta and Chuck Billy show up on \"Poison Dream\" and \"Routes\" respectively, and the former song morphs into a Hatebreed track when Jasta shows up and the latter sounds like late-career Testament. Come on that should be cynical to so blatantly cater to these guys' original bands, but it turns out Lamb of God is surprisingly really good at ripping them off. It takes what should be lazy and turns it into everybody simply playing to their strengths.\n\nThis is hard to write about, honestly. This series was fun at the start because their first five albums are all actually very different from each other but this current era of the band is generally much less creative. Basically all I can say is \"read my reviews for the last album but pretend they're good.\" I know how cheap and unhelpful that is, but it's true. If Resolution maintained the momentum of \"Desolation\" the entire time it'd probably sound fairly similar to Lamb of God. It's got all the fire and energy of that track with some pronounced influence from nu metal in spots and a renewed love of breakdowns that have been absent since 2006, which I'm sure is a turnoff for most of you but I maintain that the breakdowns were never the problem and if you're going to spike the nu metal influence, you could do a whole hell of a lot worse than Slipknot when it comes to inspiration. The biggest flaw of the album is simply the track ordering, because putting the three most generic songs right at the start is a big fuckin' thonk. The album picks up a ton of steam after \"Gears\" and it's refreshing to hear this much propulsion out of these old bones.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nThere\u2019s a peculiar practice that has been becoming popular of late where veteran metal acts opt to release an eponymous album after well after a decade of output. To be fair, Lamb Of God\u2019s recent decision to slap their band\u2019s name on an LP is likely related to this being their first studio excursion without original drumming extraordinaire Chris Adler. But whatever the case may be, it\u2019s a foregone conclusion that these New Wave of American Heavy Metal mainstays have something to prove on this album, and recently recruited kit man Arturo Cruz, of Winds Of Plague fame, proves to be an apt replacement. All the usual groove metal trappings that were in this band\u2019s arsenal since their rebranding following a brief stint under the Burn The Priest moniker are on full display, offering a full course of mid-90s Pantera trappings to go along with their more recently adopted metalcore template.\n\nWith the passage of time has come a greater arsenal of ideas for this band, and what was once a fairly contrived formula has become more and more engaging. Greater degrees of modern thrash additives and a greater penchant for cutting loose from the mid-paced chugging serves this album quite well at multiple points, though this band\u2019s greatest strength has continued to be the massive production that they\u2019ve acquired due to the long time services of Josh Wilbur. Though he originally cut his teeth as an assistant engineer working with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, his handiwork has graced this band\u2019s albums since their 2006 offering Sacrament, and newcomers to this outfit\u2019s music might recognize his handiwork on such consequential albums as Megadeth\u2019s Dystopia and Soulfly\u2019s latest offering Ritual. Suffice it to say, modern groove and thrash metal are this producer\u2019s bread and butter, and he delivers up a truly colossal production job here.\n\nIf there is a looming Persian flaw in what is otherwise a solid presentation here, it is that the songs tend to run together a bit, though this outfit carries it well by keeping things compact and to the point. The longest song of the bunch is actually the opening number \u201cMemento Mori\u201d, largely due to an extended atmospheric intro with a dreary backdrop of droning guitars backing up what can be best described as a gloomy baritone croon out of Randy Blythe, serving as a sort of prelude to the coming auditory violence that dominates the album. The rest of the song cycles through an impressive assortment of chugging grooves and modernized thrash riffs, while Blythe proceeds to be the missing link between Phil Anselmo\u2019s semi-tonal shouts and Chris Barnes\u2019 danker barks during the early days of Six Feet Under. It\u2019s not the pinnacle of what this album has to offer, but it does set the tone for what is to come quite nicely.\n\nAs things progress, this album gets more refined and effective at laying down a sonic ass-whooping, showcasing some of the better work that Lamb Of God has put forward in the past decade. The mid-paced chugging machine \u201cCheckmate\u201d stands out a fair bit by throwing in a sort of bluesy novelty intro before laying down the hammer, while pulsing speeders like \u201cGears\u201d and \u201cPoison Dream\u201d work even better by laying in some killer Bay Area inspired thrashing moments and a pair of solid, shred happy guitar solos to cut into the repetition a bit. But the absolute zenith of what this album has to offer is the blazing speed machine \u201cRoutes\u201d, which also sees the some lethal guest vocals enter the equation courtesy of Testament\u2019s own Chuck Billy. This song could basically be a banger off of one of said band\u2019s recent LPs, and also features some of the most impressive guitar gymnastics ever heard out of this band.\n\nCollectively speaking, this is one of the better groove-oriented metal albums to come down the pike since Soulfly\u2019s Ritual, but it does get maybe a tad formulaic from one song to the next and loses some steam when listened to all the way through from beginning to end. Barring the two songs that feature prominent guest vocal slots and maybe some of the material at the tail end of the album that features some occasional clean sung metalcore moments, the cumulative sound accomplished here is a fairly monolithic one. If nothing else, it\u2019s a safe yet effective pivot for a band that has some minds to set at ease given the recent shift in their otherwise 100% stable lineup. All that said, this is definitely a solid listen that is certain to play extremely well with old school Pantera fans and modern As I Lay Dying fans alike, and it\u2019s a notable cut above what a of the older groove/thrash outfits have been up to lately. \n\nOriginally written for Sonic Perspectives (www.sonicperspectives.com)\n",
        "\nAs of now, this is the most current chapter in Lamb of God's ongoing story, and for once we actually have a fairly interesting story behind it. The short version is that back in 2010, while in the Czech Republic, a 19 year old fan had jumped onstage, apparently something Randy Blythe was decidedly not cool with, and subsequently pushed him off the stage. This fan unfortunately landed on his head and shortly thereafter found himself in a coma before eventually passing away. Two years later, when the band returned to Prague on another tour, Randy was arrested for manslaughter. After spending five weeks in prison, he was released on bail and allowed to return to the states. Blythe is an international touring artist and needed to keep his name clear so he complied with everything he needed to, returning for his trial and eventually being found morally responsible since he's the one who tossed the guy off the stage, but ultimately not criminally liable since the promoter and venue didn't have adequate security.\n\nSo for once, there was some very real drama going on in the public light. The entire future of the band was in limbo and their public face and founding member was facing a future behind bars for the death of a fan. Once the dust had settled, the band had obviously undergone some serious trials in the public eye on a scale they had never experienced before. This aggressive music has always (somewhat paradoxically to the outside observer, admittedly) been something of a safe haven and a place where people can be themselves without judgment, a place to release this pent up frustration in a healthy way, and now the performance of this cathartic release of negativity directly resulted in the death of a fan. That's actually a very morally and philosophically difficult thing to face, and one that should've led to some serious introspection and an interesting examination of what metal even is in the first place. There should've been some tough questions to face. Am I just a naturally dangerous person if I could (however accidentally) kill somebody who looked up to me? Is what I do as harmless as I had always thought? Am I blameless and this dead teenager really just a recipient of a stupid prize? Can I really absolve myself of the blame for what happened? What does this mean for the scene, the band, the fans, and myself?\n\nWhat we got was Ashes of the Wake for a third time with one super boring Alice in Chains knockoff added in.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there is indeed some introspection and remorse to be found in the lyrics of Sturm und Drang, because Randy is a human being with emotions and not a meatheaded dumbass like he may seem when in performance mode, but musically almost nothing at all has changed since the lazy trash of Resolution. Almost all ten tracks here (with the notable exception of \"Overlord\") are just paint-by-numbers Lamb of God that might as well just be D-sides from their most popular album. I'm sure I would've found this album to be boring as hell even without the manslaughter trial, but it's extra disappointing to see that the band just returned to business as usual when they finally had an external reason to break from their chains a bit. If nothing else, if the band was going to continue after this, you think they'd be inspired. But no, instead we once again get another lazy cash-in with startlingly few real ideas.\n\nI'll just get the interesting parts out of the way first. \"Overlord\" is a huge departure for the band, ostensibly being an Alice in Chains style grungy ballad rife with hitherto unheard clean vocals and massive heaps of melody. The problem is that \"Overlord\" is much more of an interesting track than a good one. This is really the only risk they bothered taking on Sturm und Drang, and every other slightly left of center idea like the brief talkbox guitar on \"Erase This\" and the vocal cameos of Chino Moreno (from Deftones) and Greg Puciato (from Dillinger Escape Plan) on \"Embers\" and \"Torches\" respectively come off as meaningless gimmicks. Otherwise this is just the same as the previous album: Ashes of the Wake without the breakdowns. I need to make it abundantly clear that Ashes was the worst album of the classic era and the breakdowns weren't the fucking problem, it was the intensely boring songs themselves. If this was an album full of \"Laid to Rest\" level songs I wouldn't care at all, because that was the one song that truly worked on that album and laid the groundwork for how good the following two albums would be, but instead this is just \"One Gun\" and \"Omerta\" nine times but slightly faster and with \"Rooster\" randomly shoehorned in the middle. If anything it's even more disappointing because some tracks start off really well, with \"Delusion Pandemic\" kicking the thrash up to the highest levels they've been in years before falling into the rut of mediocrity that plagues the album, and \"Still Echoes\" does the same except with some honest to god death metal influence instead.\n\nThere isn't really a good place to put this since the lyrics are just kind of not worth mentioning in the first place, but I'll do my due diligence and point out that \"512\" is the one track explicitly about his experience in prison, and lyrically it does finally touch on those questions of introspective guilt I asked in the preamble, and while the song itself is boring as shit and the vocal performance doesn't really relay any of the emotions in the words apart from the \"My hands are painted red\" in the outro, I do commend them for at least addressing the elephant in the room. However, man am I the only one that finds \"Footprints\" to be in super bad taste? Maybe I'm just reading too much into it, but it really does feel tone deaf to have a generic song about kicking ass including lines about screaming \"get the fuck out\" to an unknown figure and defiantly asking \"how did you think this would end?!\" on an album directly following a high profile instance of you accidentally killing a guy for being in the wrong place while half of your knuckle dragging fans pinned all of the blame on the victim in the first place. Randy is a very well spoken and intelligent person, but man he's got to be the dumbest smart guy on the planet.\n\n(Also, another random aside, but has anybody else noticed that they frequently seem to reference feet in their song titles (\"Footprints\", \"Foot to the Throat\", \"Boot Scraper\") and every last one of those Footsongs ends up being meaningless filler? I dunno, just something funny I noticed.)\n\nMaybe I just want this to be something that it's not, and I mean duh, I want every bad album to be good instead, but Sturm und Drang is just a gargantuan disappointment. Even with the context of the imprisonment and trial being stripped away, this is a clear filler album just put out as an excuse to hit the road again. I feel like the band was constantly on the cusp of something truly exceptional here, because the good moments are genuinely promising, but they've really brought back their old problem of every song starting much better than it ends, except now the good parts only last for twenty seconds at the beginning of each song instead of at least managing a full two thirds of the runtime before getting dull. Maybe their formula just doesn't work anymore, but I think the entire point of this series was to show how creative and willing to take risks they used to be before just kicking their feet up and coasting on their established popularity. They put the legwork in early and then just quit giving a shit, and albums like Sturm und Drang are the end result of that. The new ideas used to form the entire identity of the albums themselves, now they're just superficial coats of paint slapped on to old ideas they seemingly have no intention of updating.\n\nMaybe the new album that will inevitably be announced on the day this review is posted because I have awful timing will prove me wrong, but as of now, the band has been on autopilot for nearly a decade, and I'm just done caring.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nHey hey hey, remember way back in the review for As the Palaces Burn when I told y'all to put a pin in a particular line from \"Ruin\"? Well here's the payoff to that particularly insufferable brick joke.\n\n\"This is the resolution / The end of all progress\"\n\nNine years before Resolution dropped, Lamb of God accidentally prophecized their own downfall, because it should be pretty clear that each album up to this point has been incredibly distinct. Wrath was the fast one, As the Palaces Burn was the one that laid the foundation for their iconic riffing style, Sacrament was the one with the atmospheric songs, etc. Resolution here is the first one without a single new idea and instead is just a wholesale rehash of Ashes of the Wake, which was already their worst album anyway. All of that lazy midpaced trash that sounded like it was written in an afternoon is back here with a vengeance, and even the three good tracks can't save this album from the trash bin.\n\nI don't even have much to say about this album simply because I've already gone over how phoned-in Ashes of the Wake was and this album is pretty much that exact same album a second time. There are a few good moments here and there, but it's not enough to save it. \"Desolation\" sounds like the second coming of \"Beating on Death's Door\" and as such is a total fucking banger with memorable riffs galore (seriously that chorus riff is one of the more simplistic ones they've ever written but holy shit is it lethal), \"Guilty\" takes their Pantera-esque groove and injects it with some honest to god death metal influence (parts of it sound like Anata (specifically the main riff sounds like \"Shackled to Guilt\") and now that I've pointed it out you won't be able to unhear it, you're welcome), and \"The Undertow\" isn't quite as inspired as the other two but at least sounds like a good version of one of the weak songs on Ashes of the Wake combined with some of Adler's most inventive drumming. But that's it, those three songs start the album off on one hell of a high note and then we're treated to nine fucking straight up filler tracks. The previous two albums really made me think they had managed to keep the songwriting consistent enough to avoid their previously crippling filler problem, but no, they were flukes.\n\nI don't even want to keep writing about this, and that's a shame because I chose to highlight this band in a series partially because each album is so different and has such a different mood. I was dreading this album simply because it's not different at all, and the fact that it's four-fucking-teen tracks long and features a stretch of nine in a row to close the album on total uninspired mediocrity is just icing on the cake. The sad thing is I'm not even entirely sure that I believe myself when I say it's just a rehash of Ashes, because it starts off with a two and a half minute dirge that's so deep and brutal that it just sounds like straight up doom metal with \"Straight for the Sun\" (which is actually pretty ballsy considering how fast and aggressive the previous album was), and it's not like \"King Me\" doesn't at least try to be super epic, \"Insurrection\" isn't their first and only track to truly flirt with nu metal, and \"Barbarosa\" isn't a full on acoustic interlude, but all of these new ideas are just so completely drowned by the total groove metal mediocrity of \"Visitation\", \"Invictus\", \"To the End\", \"Ghost Walking\", \"Terminally Unique\", etc. You'd think this would be a total banger since it's front loaded with all the best songs in the first handful of tracks but then it just flops around like a fish out of water with no real identity for the next hour and a half. The only song that's even half alright in that stretch of lameness is \"Cheated\" and even then it's only because it's the fastest one.\n\nThis is going to be the shortest one in the series because holy shit I just don't care about it. \"Desolation\" is a classic track worthy of any setlist but the rest of it (even the other good songs) are just totally skippable and not worth your time. I'm gonna get lazy and just stop now. Fuck this nothing-album.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nI remember when Wrath first dropped in 2009, I actually kind of hated it. I thought the vocals were a huge step down from the previous albums with the introduction of weird tuneless yelling in addition to the usually great roars and shrieks and thought most of the album just kinda flew in one ear and out the other. Nowadays I only hate it because it broke my titling gimmick in this review series.\n\nYeah, Wrath is actually one hell of an unappreciated highlight in Lamb of God's oeuvre. I'm gonna find myself inadvertently paraphrasing MutantClannfear's review a lot because he really nails it, but to distill it down to one sentence: This is the most legitimately pissed off the band has potentially ever sounded and pretty much every song represents the most extreme edges of groove metal with fuckloads of unhinged intensity. A common criticism of groove metal in general is that the groove riffs never feel earned, like they need to be used to break up fast sections instead of just grooving the whole time because then they lose their punch. Discounting the fact that this argument kind of accidentally writes off 80% of doom metal wholesale, Lamb of God takes that criticism and smashes it against the wall by making the grooves themselves the fast parts of the album. This motherfucker rarely slows down, and pretty much every second is crammed full of riffs, more riffs, a surprising amount of melody and solos considering the band we're talking about here, and a few more riffs for good measure.\n\nI'm probably overselling it a bit, but that's because I feel like I have to overcompensate with this album for reasons I'll get to later, but at the same time I don't think I'm wrong about anything I've said in the preceding paragraph. Tracks like \"Set to Fail\", \"Contractor\", and moments of \"Dead Seeds\" are absolutely fucking batshit in how fast they are (say what you will about Lamb of God, they were never a particularly \"fast\" band until this moment apart from a few scattered tracks). \"Choke Sermon\" actually sounds like a fucking Megadeth song and if you're mentally raising your hand to tell me that's insane, I'd ask you to shove that hand back up the ass it came from. I think I finally understand why people insisted on calling groove metal \"half-thrash\" for so many years, because it turns out that simply speeding it up by 50bpm turns it into fuckin' \"Ashes in Your Mouth\" and that's fucking rad. This speed also lays to rest that criticism from before, because holy shit does Lamb of God earn the breakdowns and more mid-paced groove sections this time around. This is exactly what groove metal is supposed to be, and it's good to know that Sacrament was on the right path by finally eschewing the last of the metalcore influences because they've pretty definitively proved that they know how to make straight up groove metal work here.\n\nWrath is also deceptively dynamic. At the time I thought it felt kind of stilted, but now, especially after listening to their discography chronologically, the bits like the acoustic intro track, the gorgeous harmonized guitar solo on \"Grace\", the stuttery stereo-flipping breakdown of followed by the dissonantly atmospheric outro of \"Reclamation\", the damn near full on extreme metal of \"Everything to Nothing\", the bludgeoning beatdown in \"Fake Messiah\", just... everything sounds like the logical conclusion of the creativity they'd been toying with on the previous album. There're a lot of different ideas here, and they all sound natural (as opposed to the focus-tested calculation of Ashes of the Wake). Even those vocals on \"In Your Words\" that I hated ten years ago sound like a daring experiment more than a boneheaded bad idea this time around.\n\nI just want to take a moment here to highlight precisely how awesome \"Contractor\" is. This track got a lot of flak from the cliched \"true metal\" crowd here and such when it came out, and now that the dust has been settled for the better part of a decade, it's almost hilarious how badly everyone misjudged this track. There were all sorts of criticisms thrown at it for the opening whoop-holler and the lyrics being dumbass bro-sturbation about blowing shit up. But while everybody was busy scratching their heads and pretending not to know what it was about, they all seemed to completely overlook the fact that it was a pretty scathing condemnation of private military forces populated by maladjusted bullies who peaked in high school gleefully turning Iraqi children into paste. Blackwater even gets fucking mentioned by name I mean holy shit how do you miss the point that hard? Lamb of God has come a long way from defending the Confederate flag on As the Palaces Burn. Beyond the lyrics, \"Contractor\" is one of the tightest and most well written tracks they've ever penned, running in three distinct movements: the opening salvo of aggression and pretty much non-stop machine gun riffing, the exceedingly slow middle section that crushes harder than Giles Corey, and punctuated by the final act of abrupt chaos led in by one of Randy's all time best screams. Again, maybe it's just the Pantera fan in me, but \"Contractor\" is almost a beat-by-beat reimagining of \"Strength Beyond Strength\", aka The Best God Damned Song Pantera Ever Wrote. If namedropping Pantera just turned you off, I don't know what to tell you. Grow up, I guess.\n\nAs much as I obviously like Wrath, I'll freely admit it isn't perfect. \"Fake Messiah\" and \"Broken Hands\" absolutely repeat way too much and tend to drag, and they'd pretty much instantly ruin the flow of the album if they weren't separated by the astoundingly good \"Grace\", and \"Set to Fail\" is really disappointing in starting off with blast beats and a shitload of aggression before morphing into a decent b-side from Ashes of the Wake. But really these are just nitpicks. In the grand scheme of things this is a pretty fucking excellent album. Every single member (barring bassist John Campbell, who from day one has always been an almost hilariously inconsequential non-entity when it comes to their sound) is on top of their game and all but a few songs are total knockouts. I love Wrath and you should too, this is everything that \"open minded\" metal fans claim groove metal should be.\n\nI want to close by scratching an itch here, and that's that you might've noticed several reviews voicing bewilderment/curiosity at this album's comparatively low score here compared to everything else they'd done (it's been balanced somewhat over time but the reviews stay forever). For those of you who weren't here ten years ago, you may have missed the total flogging that the \"Contractor\" single got, and almost every criticism against it was bad faith nonsense from people who had no intention of giving the thing a critical listen in the first place. I don't like to flat out accuse my compatriots of acting in bad faith, but when every single review feels it important to point out the squeal in the intro and constantly refer to that first riff as \"chugging\" or \"mallcore\" or \"just fast palm muted chugging punctuated by random powerchords\" which is exactly what a thrash riff is by the way then I just can't help but hop on my soapbox and yell about the flagrant misrepresentation. Hyper fast palm mutes have never in the history of metal been referred to as \"chugging\" until that moment, and it was entirely because Lamb of God used a shitload of chug riffs on the albums leading up to this one. So yeah, between the review-bombing and the vocal hatred on the forums, it became a weird fad to rip on that track, and when the album dropped in full, a lot of that misrepresented vitriol just kinda carried over onto Wrath itself. I get it, Lamb of God isn't for everybody, but if you're curious about this album and would rather read some reviews before listening for yourself, I feel confident in saying you should disregard everything up until like 2011 when shit finally blew over.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nFor a long time, I had considered Sacrament to be my unequivocal favorite Lamb of God album. Time has softened it somewhat, but I'll spoil the ending a bit and say that this is probably the only album besides the debut where the non-single tracks feel less like filler and more like deep cuts, and that alone puts this a few pedestals higher than the snorefest that was Ashes of the Wake.\n\nI think the thing that stands out the most about Sacrament is that this actually marked a pretty daring departure from the last two albums. As the Palaces Burn and Ashes of the Wake were very similar albums, and while Sacrament certainly sticks close to a proven formula on certain tracks, they really did branch out and try a lot of new things with this one. For example, for a band that had made it a habit to always open on something explosive and hard hitting, it was actually pretty ballsy to kick this album off with \"Walk with Me in Hell\", a starkly atmospheric and relatively slow track that even throws some subtle synths in the intro. And then to follow it up with \"Again We Rise\", an oddly anthemic song that works so much better as a live singalong than the fucking embarrassment that was \"Now You've Got Something to Die For\", that tells me that they were making a statement with this record, and dammit I think they made it quite well. They weren't going to stick with the formula like they did last time, and that's an ethos they stick with throughout the entire album.\n\nThat's not to say they never go back to the previous sound, because they definitely do on tracks like \"Pathetic\", \"Foot to the Throat\", and \"More Time to Kill\", and it's probably not a coincidence that the latter two songs there are two of the only true filler songs (the other being \"Requiem\", which takes the slightly more atmsopheric bent of \"Again We Rise\" but is simply less good). This is probably the album where Lamb of God took the most risks while at the same time being the most accessible they'll ever be. This is because at this point the metalcore element of their sound is almost totally gone apart from the odd breakdown here and there, instead replaced entirely with Pantera-esque groove. I know that's a turnoff for a lot of metal fans, but I happen to think Pantera is great and as a result I think this album is pretty good as well. \"Redneck\" is probably the best example of this, being the big \"hit single\" from this album and sounding like a lost session from The Great Southern Trendkill. It's simultaneously very fast and groovy as hell, and turns into an extremely catchy song that's easy enough to be found on the radio but heavy enough to scare off most non-metal fans. It's probably the weakest non-filler song on the album but it's still a lot of fun to caveman out to. Pure knuckle dragging idiocy that I can't help but adore in its sincerity.\n\nIt's been a while since I've seen it, but certain editions of this album came with a bonus DVD detailing the making of this album, and due to that I've actually been waiting for the band to finally break up for a long time. I know the Killadelphia DVD is more infamous for it showing how volatile the band was behind the scenes, with the unforgettable sequence of Randy Blythe picking a fight with Mark Morton while drunk off his ass and promptly getting his lights punched out, but the making of DVD included with Sacrament showed a much sadder side of the band. After the infamous beatdown, Randy actually swore off alcohol and to my knowledge has been sober ever since (this is actually the lyrical subject of \"Pathetic\", if you were curious), and his newfound sobriety seemed to hang something of a dark cloud over the band, where absolutely nobody seemed interested in the recording process of this one. The way the band wrote albums (at least back then) was for everybody to write a handful of songs on their own and then bring them into the studio already finished, where the rest of the guys would learn them and they'd collectively choose the best ones for the album. This led to an environment where seemingly nobody was engaged with the whole process and turned a naturally organic process like songwriting into an individual exercise to later be culled via a band vote. I recall them not being particularly receptive to Mark's contributions, because he's the guy who listens to the most non-metal when he's not working with the band and it apparently leaked into his songwriting. There was some intense debate over whether or not to include one of his songs because they claimed it was a rock song and nobody wanted to hear a rock song plopped in the middle of a metal album. Ultimately the song was included, and I can't remember which song it was. It was either \"Descending\" or \"Blacken the Cursed Sun\" and both of them follow the lead of \"Walk with Me in Hell\" so I really have no idea what it is they objected to so much. The guys were so focused on picking each others nits that they started to say bizarre nonsense that threatened to undermine the very creativity that makes this album so enjoyable.\n\nFor better or worse (better, at this point), the band trucked through these disagreements and delivered a solid album with way more ideas than your average Lamb of God album. From the atmospheric elements of \"Walk with Me in Hell\" and \"Blacken the Cursed Sun\", to the new inclusion of several booming clean vocals, to the pure Pantera worship of \"Redneck\", to the high speed thrash influence of \"Forgotten (Lost Angels)\" and \"Beating on Death's Door\", to returning to the old formula and basically writing \"The Faded Line\" but actually good this time with \"Pathetic\", there's a lot to like here and I'm very impressed with what they were willing to experiment with here. Even if the core sound is largely unchanged apart from fewer breakdowns and melodeath riffs, there are a lot of peripheral risks that make this one of their most interesting albums. Despite being their most varied album, Sacrament is actually pretty hard to talk about because all I can think to do is point to a random track and say what different thing they tried to do, and I've exhausted that avenue already, so I'll just wrap this up now.\n\nSacrament is good, and easily the best of their \"classic\" trilogy that encompasses this and the previous two albums. \"Beating on Death's Door\" is easily their most underappreciated song and \"Lost Angels\" isn't too far behind. It was never their bread and butter, but when they just kick the tempo into high gear and border on thrash as much as they can, they can really strike gold. \"Foot to the Throat\", \"Requiem\" and \"More Time to Kill\" are the token filler tracks, but that just means this album has nine good songs instead of two, and I'd say that's a pretty fucking huge improvement from its predecessor.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nI can remember the exact moment the curtain was peeled back on Lamb of God for me. It was during the brief period I was in a real band when I was in high school, sometime around 2006. We decided we should learn a cover or two in addition to writing originals just to kind of help us gel as players together, and we decided on Lamb of God's \"Hourglass\" among a few others. We all went home to learn our respective parts, and at the next band practice we all announced pretty much in unison \"Man, did anyone else not realize before how fucking boring that song is?\" Yeah it turns out that once you strip the drums away (which are always the most impressive part of any given Lamb of God track), the riffs themselves are just fucking dull as hell and completely mind numbing to play, and \"Hourglass\" is a great representative for such a phenomenon. I think we all decided on that song initially because that riff about one minute into the song is fucking devastating, but after that glorious twenty seconds, the guitars and bass basically just play straight eighth notes at one tempo for the next three solid minutes and not a single one of us ever wanted to play it again.\n\nNow, obviously I still liked Lamb of God after this moment (as you'll see as the series continues), but it really does highlight one of the biggest problems with Ashes of the Wake. While it may be their most popular album by a pretty huge margin and is considered a high watermark for the scene, it is boring as shit once you pay attention medium-hard. In fact this is the one I'm probably most dreading writing about simply because I fucking hate listening to it.\n\nThe band was already well popular by this point, but this really sees the band on autopilot, which might sound odd considering it's their most iconic album and features their most popular song, but it's true. That inspired ferocity of New American Gospel is pretty much entirely gone at this point, replaced with a very calculated sense of obligation. Almost all of these riffs sound focus tested to an extreme degree. Whenever it sounds like they're about to really break out into some sort of unhinged aggression, it steps back and starts plodding with super pedestrian groove riffs. \"The Faded Line\" is a great example of this, with that neat zippy guitar line right before the chorus barges in and starts stinking up the joint with an uninspired In Flames knockoff riff. The title track does this as well, with that pure thrash riff that starts up about a minute into the song (what is up with this album and the good riffs starting at the one minute mark and never showing up again?) is absolutely fucking explosive but finds itself bookended by phoned-in nonsense and a really piddly atmospheric section. \"Ashes of the Wake\" has potential to be the best song in general since it's loaded with solos (something the band tends to eschew) and contains the best riff on the album, but as it stands its really bloated and faffs about with no real direction far too often, especially in the slower middle section.\n\nIt's hard to really describe the problems with the album outside of just calling it phoned-in or half-assed, because that's really all it is. It's the exact same type of riff structure and songwriting flow that made the good songs on As the Palaces Burn work so well, but apart from a few scattered tracks they all just sound like they were written in an afternoon in a quick attempt to cash in on the success of the previous album (it did come out a mere 15 months later, and it's not like they didn't tour in support of that previous album). I mean holy shit listen to \"Omerta\", it's a five minute track that feels like fifteen because it's just mid paced plodding that never gets to the god damned point. It's also one of the oddly several tracks with spoken word segments, which always feel like pointless add-ons that Randy couldn't be bothered to growl properly. The opening of \"Omerta\" is the most egregious since it's completely a capella and even structures the words themselves in such a way that they rob themselves of dramatic tension. That's such a weird thing to call out, but there's a reason he flips the \"If I live, I will kill you, if I die, you are forgiven\" part when they play this song live.\n\nThe good songs are easy to point out, because there's only really two of them. I'll give a little bit of credit to \"Blood of the Scribe\" for having a good amount of adrenaline in it for a few moments, but it mostly falls into the same trap as \"Hourglass\" where it starts off way better than it ends (the exact opposite problem of what they suffered on the previous album), but it's really not a contest when it comes to what the best songs are. \"Break You\" and \"Laid to Rest\" absolutely tear the rest of this album to shreds, without fucking question. The former sounds like a lost session from As the Palaces Burn with how frenetic it is, and it's such a welcome feature for pretty much every aspect to shift as often as it does since the rest of the album is so pedestrian and samey. The tempo is constantly fluctuating up to some of the album's highest speeds, the riffs are positively thrashy at times (this isn't usually their strength, but on this album almost all of the best riffs sound like lost thrash riffs) and Randy utilizes his higher register much more often on this one than any other track.\n\nBut really, I'm dancing around the elephant in the room here. \"Laid to Rest\" is the band's signature song, the one that found itself on Guitar Hero II, the one they are guaranteed to play at every single show (I saw them like eight times between 2006-2010 and they opened with it every damn time), and holy shit did it earn that distinction. You'd think Ashes of the Wake was going to be this massive fucking statement based on how monstrously huge the opening track is, because god damn is \"Laid to Rest\" a fucking statement. Every single riff is pulverizing, the song is built in such a way that it just keeps pummeling you over and over again, the chorus is gorgeously destructive, even the \"SEE WHO GIVES A FUCK\" part is so corny that it loops around to being endearing. Even the breakdown fucking kills, which is impressive because this album is so loaded with lazy-ass open-string chug breakdowns that feel thrown in as an obligation. And when it ends and the chorus riff comes charging back in underneath a fifteen second scream? Just god damn I break my oath to the Volcel Police every time. The whole song is fucking excellent and is pretty much the anthem for this nebulous \"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\" that was sweeping the nation at the time. This is the song that every God Forbid and Shadows Fall wished they had written.\n\nAgain, there's really no place to put this, but it's worth mentioning that they definitely got the production right on this one. Instead of the mix being a muddy slush of excess gain that sounds like it was recorded on a cell phone, Ashes of the Wake is exactly as tight and heavy as the songs themselves. As far as I'm concerned this album has two true claims to fame despite all of the lazy bullshit on it: \"Laid to Rest\" is an awesome song and at least they got the production right this time. I'm never going to bring up the production again because every single album from here on out sounds exactly like this one.\n\nAnd yet, Ashes of the Wake drops the ball super quickly afterwards because it's almost nothing but lameass filler from the second track until the end. I didn't even point out how much \"Now You've Got Something to Die For\" sucks, but it really needs to be mentioned that it truly does suck. What a lazy and uninspired excuse for a crowd singalong. The day they retire it from the setlist is the day I'll consider paying money to see them live again. The few scattered moments of excellence that pop up in \"Blood of the Scribe\" and the title track plus the lone other good-the-whole-time track, \"Break You\", just can't overcome the lazy weakness of the rest of the album. Lamb of God cemented their legacy on this album, but it's a shame because god damn this is their first truly bad one.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nBefore I say anything else, can I just say that \"Ruin\", despite being one of the band's better songs, is a really shitty opening track? Man it just doesn't give off the feeling of an opening track. Sure it sets the tone for the album, but it starts off with its weakest riff, neither easing the listener into the experience nor smashing them in the face at full force. It just immediately smacks you with a really lazy and mediocre riff and that's just a terrible way to start things off, even if the song gets continually better as it goes, featuring one of their extremely rare (at the time) guitar solos and one of the fastest breakdowns in the genre. And hey, the \"chorus\" section is startlingly catchy as well. Keep an eye out for that part and specifically the line \"This is the resolution / The end of all progress\". Put a pin in those nine words, they're going to be very important later.\n\nAnyway, As the Palaces Burn is Lamb of God's second album, and is very clearly the album where they found their niche. I love New American Gospel, but I'd never pinpoint it as a starting point for somebody who wants to understand what the band is all about. Their debut is a mess of sloppy noise that accidentally coalesced into a devastating monument to modern brutality, but it was As the Palaces Burn where everything truly came into form. This is the album where the Pantera-isms came to the forefront, where their own distinctive riffing style blossomed, where the songwriting started becoming more \"normal\" and less of a winding stream of consciousness, where Randy's vocals took on that deeper register they're most known for, it all truly started here. What makes this special as opposed to \"just another Lamb of God album\" isn't necessarily that it all started here, it's that it's just unrefined enough to still sound like a young band coming into their own. There's a sort of charm to that.\n\nI struggle to explain exactly what I mean when I mention their distinctive riffing style, simply because I'm not a guitar player and I don't understand music theory beyond the most basic idea of what an accidental is, but there's a very specific key or scale that they seem to always use. It's very prevalent in the opening riff to \"11th Hour\". In fact, almost the entire remainder of their career is foreshadowed in \"11th Hour\". Anybody who understands what the fuck a diminished phyrgian locrian hullabaloobian scale means, please tell me what the fuck it is that Lamb of God is always playing in. They seem to have a very specific scale that is instantly recognizable but I lack the technical term for it and it's been driving me crazy for decades.\n\nOne of the most notable flaws of the band that truly begins here, that will (spoilers) absolutely become their achilles heel in the future, is that they very quickly morphed into a \"hit single\" type band. That manic consistency of the debut is wholly gone here. I don't know exactly how calculated it is, but from here on out it becomes very clear that each album will have two or three excellent standouts and then a bunch of filler. As the Palaces Burn tends to fare a bit better than some of their future works, but there's no denying that half of this album is a total bore, and those five meaningless tracks are all right in a row. \"Ruin\" opens the album on something of a whimper but it picks up a hell of a lot of kinetic energy, establishes their talent for hooks, and culminates with an absolutely devastating breakdown that seems to fly past at 200+bpm. It's followed up by the title track and \"Purified\", two of their most underappreciated songs. The former is a total barnburner, wasting zero time with intros or buildup and opening with a hockey stick to the teeth, and \"Purified\" stands as their thrashiest song without a doubt (it even has a guest solo courtesy of Chris Poland). That verse riff still decimates me, and the intensity is maintained throughout. \"11th Hour\" is the worst of the good songs, but it's still solid enough. It's very much in line with what The Haunted was doing at the time, with a very meaty dose of Pantera-esque groove. Chris keeps the intensity high with his frantic drumming, but this is the track that knocks the tempo down a few pegs from the blistering triad at the start and it never really recovers. This is clearly meant to be a more atmospheric and melodic take on that pissed off early 2000s metalcore that they championed on the first few tracks, and while it never goes into the overtly theatrical shit that Killswitch Engage did, they're obviously doing something very different here. The track is saved from the weak chorus with the dumb *dweeuhnuh DWEAOWHNUH* guitar line by the back half which brings back some of that cataclsymic heaviness showcased in the back half of \"Ruin\".\n\nThen the next five tracks happen. From \"For Your Malice\" to \"Blood Junkie\", you just get \"11th Hour\" five more times and it gets real tiring real fast. I've been a fan of this album for like fifteen years and I still can't differentiate any of those songs between each other. There's a reason the only tracks that get trotted out live are the first handful and the closer, because this entire middle stretch is just filler in its most cynical form. I can only imagine that the guys wrote \"11th Hour\" first and then decided that they really liked it, probably got a good reaction when they played it to friends or at shows before the album was done or something, and just figured it'd be safe to keep doing that song forever. Even the fast moments on \"Boot Scraper\" and such feel mid paced and sluggish, not even Adler's spastic drumming can keep them interesting as a whole (instead he's the only interesting component of them). I can say this is probably the first time the lyrics themselves are worth noting though. I haven't really brought them up before because they're kinda inconsequential and just an excuse for Randy to make crazy mouth sounds since he still wasn't really enunciating his words at this point, but in a desperate search to find anything cool about this stretch of boredom I did discover that \"In Defense of Our Good Name\" contains some weirdly icky shit about southern pride and how slavery was bad but we should probably stop holding it against the people who for some odd reason can't seem to let go of the Confederacy. Nah, I know you guys are from Virginia and all, but don't be proud of that particular part of your heritage. Keep singing about how humanity is shit and the church is a lie, leave the socially conscious lyrics elsewhere. You really suck at picking your targets apparently.\n\nI did a quasi-track by track thing up there because it's really worth noting how quickly the album dips after the fourth track, but it's not a total split. I mentioned the closer up there for good reason. \"Vigil\" is, potentially, their best song throughout their discography. They (probably not coincidentally) closed their first two albums with their slowest tracks, showcasing riffs that landed on some middle ground between Sabbath and Obituary, and of the tracks that take this approach, \"Vigil\" is clearly the better one. The acoustic intro is a new thing for them, and it's capable of tearing the roof off any establishment once that monstrous doom riff (and yeah, it's a legitimately punishing doom riff instead of simply slower metalcore like they often are in the slower sections) smashes in. I'm sure you've probably noticed that I've been praising \"the back half\" of songs pretty often, and that's no accident. At this point in time, Lamb of God was very good at picking up steam as they went, with each new riff building upon a previous one until the resulting katamari steamrolled the listener with alarming lethality. \"Vigil\" becomes positively fucking feral in final two minutes, throwing back to the total chaos of New American Gospel.\n\nThere really wasn't a good place to put this other than as a tacked on addendum at the end here, but As the Palaces Burn has another glaring flaw apart from the five track stretch of mediocrity, and that's that the production is bafflingly terrible. Between this and Metallica, 2003 really must've just been the year of bewilderingly bad production jobs from people that absolutely should've known better. This was produced by Devin Townsend of all people, somebody who clearly knows how to make metal sound good, but for whatever reason, either at his behest or the band's, As the Palaces Burn sounds like a low quality secondhand dub. I can only assume what they were going for here was a sound that could be described as \"raw\", but man there's a really clear difference between the raw sound on New American Gospel where it was coupled with raw and unsifted songs, and the much more calculated and finely tuned riffwork here being completely butchered by talented people trying to make it sound shitty on purpose. This is one of the few modern metal albums where I really think it's worthwhile to just skip the original product and get the remastered version they released for the 10th anniversary, it's at least a thousand times better considering the tightness of the songs themselves.\n\nAt the end of the day, As the Palaces Burn is a mixed bag. It has some bona fide scorchers with tracks like \"Purified\" and \"Ruin\" and even some genuine outside-the-box creativity for the band in \"Vigil\". But the atrocious mix and at least five and a half songs of indisputable filler on a ten track album makes it a bit of a hard sell. It still ends with a positive score because the good tracks are definitely worth listening to (the good half of the album are all live staples for a reason) and it's noteworthy for being the album where Lamb of God truly started forging their own identity in the burgeoning metalcore scene, but I'd be lying through my teeth if I said it wasn't massively flawed.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nLamb of God first broke onto the scene in 2000 with this, New American Gospel, an arguably ambitious title because whether they knew it or not, they were right on the cusp of ushering in an entirely new era of heavy music for the country. Despite that, New American Gospel is really unique in their discography because, unless this is your first exposure to the band, this is clearly very different from the sound they'd become known for in the near future. In essence, this album pulls double duty being both the first Lamb of God album and effectively the second Burn the Priest album.\n\nAt this point in time, Lamb of God was still a very chaotic band. That's not to say this is really spazzy and technical, because it's not, but this is by far the most anarchic and least structured album of their career. At almost no point does the band sound like they really know what they're doing, and frankly that's the entire appeal to me. This is the sound of a relatively young band (though everybody barring Willie Adler, the \"baby\" of the band being a few years younger than the rest, were all in their late 20s at the time) just flying by the seat of their pants and figuring shit out as they went. There are obviously moments of well crafted songwriting like the iconic buildup in \"Black Label\" or the intro of \"The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion\", but on tracks like \"A Warning\", \"In the Absence of the Sacred\", and especially \"Confessional\" they sound absolutely fucking unhinged. There is a shitload of hardcore influence on here, and I don't mean the same kind of hardcore influence that many of their contemporaries in the As I Lay Dying or Killswitch Engage camps were showcasing. This is less about calculated dropped-string open chugs and more about sheer chaotic noise. It would be misleading to say that specific type of chuggy breakdown never appears here, it's pretty common actually, but the songs aren't built around them. Instead everything feels like it happens by accident. This is a very organic album that drowns itself in agony and frustration, with the drums lashing out in violent tantrums at seemingly random times underneath discordant and damn near unlistenable wailing riffs.\n\nThat might sound like I'm knocking the album, but I'm really not. This is going to be an insane comparison, but bear with me: I view New American Gospel similarly to how I view Ulver's Nattens Madrigal. I know they're very different albums, but they have a common thread between them in that they're nigh unlistenable masterpieces. This album is, objectively speaking, a fucking mess. It's a structureless mishmash of disconnected riffs and drums that are far more technical than any of the other instruments, which seem content to take quasi Pantera-esque groove and inject them with massive doses of speed and dissonance. The typical verse-chorus structure is nowhere to be found here, with each song instead ebbing and flowing with its own self contained energy. This is said with the benefit of hindsight, but considering where the band would go from here, this became an excellent monument to weirdness within their discography pretty quickly. This is a very loose album, for sure. The one thing holding everything together is Chris Adler's drum performance, which is comparatively extremely tight and paradoxically technical. He throws in little triplet fills all over the place and manages to tie the room together despite being one of the most chaotic elements of the band in a vacuum. I'm sure if you could hear isolated drum tracks somehow, it'd be almost impossible to tell which track you're listening to, he's all over the god damned place.\n\nBut really, there's an elephant in the room here, and it's time to address it. Randy Blythe's vocals on this are wildly different from what he'd rise to prominence with... and they're actually the best part of the album. Whereas every album after this he'd feature a very deep roar/shout (more in line with his almost hilariously bassy speaking voice, seriously he talks like fucking Xerxes from 300) on the debut here he features a piercing shriek almost exclusively. Even when he goes deep, he sounds like he's wailing and/or vomiting. It's almost black metal-esque in approach, though it's probably more accurate to compare it to the more emotionally brutal hardcore bands of the 90s. He sounds like a mix of a choking leopard and Chewbacca trying to lose weight for the prom. This vocal performance is really what I think makes New American Gospel so special, because it recontextualizes all of the nasty riffage into something positively ugly. Despite the nearly endless praise I've given this album, it's honestly really hard to listen to, and Randy is a big reason why. Everything is so painful and raw, like he's tearing his own heart out and bleeding all over the floor with each line. It's well known that he was a bona fide semi-functioning alcoholic for most of the band's early era, and it's also well known that he was absolutely fucking hammered when recording this album. From what I understand, he recorded all of his vocal tracks in one day, drunk off his gourd, with no breaks. \"Black Label\" is famous for having only four real words followed by a bunch of random scat noises that they tried to fit lyrics to afterwards. \"Letter to the Unborn\" is also pretty infamous for the lyrics being unknown apart from fan guesses thanks to the band refusing to publish them since they were so personal (though it's known that it's about Randy and his wife at the time suffering a miscarriage). It adds so much to that aforementioned raw ugliness of the record, Randy being pissed to his eyes during recording and just being super broken and vulnerable at the time. You don't get that sort of open passion every day, and they never managed to recreate it.\n\nOverall, despite being a tough listen featuring ten tracks of seemingly random screeching noises, I'd actually almost be willing to lay my chips down as this being my favorite Lamb of God album based solely on its consistency. There are no real dips in quality here apart from maaaaybe \"Pariah\" and \"The Black Dahlia\" being kinda inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, though the former has an absolutely blistering climax. The groove element that would soon become their bread and butter is here, but it's somewhat hidden underneath layers and layers of screaming madness. \"Black Label\" has it in spades and \"O.D.H.G.A.B.F.E\" is presented as an almost Sabbathy dirge of doom riffs, but upon further examination it's just slower groove riffs. Either way, New American Gospel is the biggest black sheep in their discography, in part because it's stylistically closer to their Burn the Priest era than anything else, and ergo is indisputably their most intense record, replete with thrashy discordant hardcore and arguably grindcore influenced blasts of ferocity. It's admittedly a hard listen, with an aversion to catchiness and a severely undercooked production underneath a wailing vocal performance. Honestly though? I wouldn't change a single thing about this album. It's an accidental masterpiece, pure lightning in a bottle that they never came close to recapturing.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nLamb of God has been having a remarkable progression and is generally considered the leader of the American metal of the 2000s. Drawing influences from Pantera, Slayer and the Swedish melodeath scene.\n\nVII: Sturm und Drang came out after lead vocalist Randy Blythe's manslaughter case. As an album it is not breaking any new ground in terms of songwriting or tonal innovations. Predictable songwriting, easy to digest riffs, vocals that lack projection and lowest common denominator choices. As a positive aspect, the technique is of high standards and the song structures are well thought out. However the album is completely lacking the ferociousness and bite you would expect from an extreme metal band. Most of the choruses contain an 'In Flames' melodic progression and the clean/\"creepy\" lead lines also seem to be influenced from the Swedish fathers of metalcore. That's the keyword actually Metalcore. No matter how much they try, in the end they're not too different to Killswitch Engage and this album is the proof.\n\nIf you let VII: Sturm und Drang play in the background while you are doing other things, you won't even notice it. Nothing would bother you but more importantly nothing will grab your attention either. Everything is done by the book, the band performance feels normalised to sub-optimal levels and the production is the safest you can think of.\n\nWhat I can never get over though is Randy Blythe's uninspired vocal delivery. You can hear that that the Melissa Cross vocal courses have resulted in him adding zero projection to his performance. That technique is great when you're out on tour and you want to preserve your voice, but when you're recording an album you need to put your whole soul into it. He definitely doesn't and every time I hear him sing I feel getting ripped off.\n\nIf you are into metalcore, this is a good example of the genre. If you're after proper metal, that is evil and daring, look elsewhere.\n",
        "\nThere isn't much that needs to be said about Lamb of God in the year 2019, they play a hybrid of groove metal and metalcore, they got pretty popular for awhile and they seem to be the opening act for every leg of Slayer's final (or so they say) world tour, they won a grammy at some point and used to get some play on MTV. Needless to say, if you're a fan of metal, regardless what kind, then you probably have some familiarity with Lamb of God.\n\nNot every notable metal band has a good start though, and Lamb of God's is one of the ones that didn't. Pairing bad production that makes the drums sound clicky and plastic with some really annoying inhale screams this album is questionable from the second it starts. Half the time Randy sounds like a competent vocalist, at other parts it sounds like he's too hung over to even remember that music has keys. Sometimes the leads are cool like right before the breakdown in the opening track, breakdown starts about 1 minute and 40 seconds in if you want to hear that lead, sometimes the leads are buried under neath clicky drums and a chugging rhythm guitar, one thing all the leads have in common though is sounding like Dimebag trying to make a melody out of three notes, and generally the same three notes. Riff wise the album brings a sort of thrashing chug sound that revolves around shifting time signatures to prevent it from getting stagnant, Pariah for example has an exceptionally chuggy riff sounding a bit like \"nyuhnyuhnyuh dun dun nyuhnyuhnyuh dun dun dun dun\" that sort has that crunchy fast pace sound you would expect from thrash but stripping the whole thing down to just a single finger muted note. The order of the mixing places inhales on top, click drums second, chuggy riffs third, lead guitar fourth and bass underneath the rest, accentuating all of the album's worst musical traits and burying all the redeemable ones. Its supposed to sound raw I suppose, some people like it, I don't.\n\nAnyways, the overall styling leaves a weird album that doesn't really go anywhere. New American Gospel is first and foremost intended to be a hard hitting album, it achieves this, but the secondary stylings don't really work. The precision created by the combined efforts of the drumming and rhythm guitar work is sort of lost due to Randy being utterly unintelligible and seeming to have little voice control. The atmospheric touches the of the lead guitar are buried.\n",
        "\nLamb of God redeemed themselves when they released As The Palaces Burn, an excellent album with great songwriting and the like, but could they keep up the traction with their next release? Ashes Of The Wake not only says yes, it exceeded my expectations. I was thinking of a weak third entry as they, in my eyes, spent a lot of creativity on As The Palaces Burn, but they were able to muster together this kick-ass album, one that they haven't been able to top. \n\nGood God Randy is a mean vocalist. He proved that he could change his style to fit the tone of the band, but on this record he damn near perfects it. His style didn't change much from the last record, but it was just enough to keep it interesting. He does a lot of talking on this record, of which I do not like at all. It gives an air of vanity to Randy, kind of saying that he doesn't need to scream in order to sound badass. That goes for any vocalist really. It sounds so stupid. Anyways, his low growls have improved, cementing his sound within Lamb of God. Even though future records wouldn't be all to good, Randy's vocals became something I look forward to on future Lamb of God records. Randy does bring back the old high scream on \"Break You,\" and it has improved vastly.\n\nUnlike the last two albums, I got very few punk vibes this time around. I am unsure as how to feel about it, as it gave the last two that grimy edge that this one doesn't have. Instead, Ashes Of The Wake is cold, mechanical, and very dark. Mark and Willie really went out for a much colder feel for this record, and is works very well. Their riffage is not all too complex for the most part, but when songs like the title track play, that being, \"Ashes Of The Wake,\" a five minute instrumental, they go all out and don't hold back. Another perfect example is \"Blood of the Scribe,\" a kicker with a fast intro, blasting double kicks provided so graciously by Chris, of whom really proves himself. John doesn't hold back all to much either, providing an excellent backing to the guitars and drums. Some of the lyrics kind of feel reused, but not to the point that it is overtly obvious. Back to the drums, Chris really went for the death metal vibe instead of the punk-death infusion that I've previously harped on. It really doesn't matter, as he is able to keep up the drumming, giving that cold death metal feel for the entirety of the record. \n\nThis time around, the production of this record is pretty damn swell. Nothing seems to take up to much space. They really went for the death metal mix, having the guitars be very fuzzy and middy. John's bass is too quiet for me this time around. I can really only hear it on \"What I've Become\" and \"Blood Of The Scribe.\" If I were in the control room, I would have made it somewhat louder, but that is my personal preference only. Chris' drum kit is mixed very well, like last time. The bass drum is very pronounced, the cymbals sound excellent, and the rest of the kit is great. Randy's vocals are not quiet this time around and sound crisp. Nothing clashes, fitting all together very nicely.\n\nIf this band were a group of politicians, this album would be their collective manifesto. Heavy anti-war messages permeate from Ashes Of The Wake, as it was written during the very beginning of the Iraq Conflict. The title track, despite being an instrumental, has an account of a solider from Iraq talking about what happened, saying that any car that came within their perimeter, that they would \"light 'em up.\" Besides that account, everything else is from the band and fits very well with the tone of the album. The rest is the classic \"fuck humanity,\" \"our government sucks,\" and \"I'm going to kill you and everyone else\" that Lamb of God has become known for. Overall, this is an excellent album\n",
        "\nAs The Palaces Burn is a huge improvement from New American Gospel, of which is one of the weakest in Lamb of God's career, besides their \"The Duke\" EP, of which really falls into that cookie-cutter metalcore sound. Anyways, this album really shows off the talent that Lamb of God has in store. \n\nWhen Randy's first scream hit me, I knew that this was going to be a much better record than New American Gospel. The first thing that hit me about his vocals that they were in a completely new style. Instead of a punk-esque scream that fades and gets weaker with every song, Randy's new low growl sustains itself throughout the entire record, possibly even getting better. I am unsure if Randy got a vocal coach or he was able to train himself since the band's first release three years previous, but he is able to add to this albums overall listening value, instead of subtracting from it. \n\nOverall song writing and structure has increased as well. Instead of fitting into the metalcore mold that so many people put this band in, Chris, Mark, Willie, John, and Randy go for a death metal sound infused with punk, and it works very well this time. The more punk aspects come out with songs like \"As The Palaces Burn,\" being fast and unrelenting, almost reminding me of \"Bloodletting\" from BTP. The entire album is not forceful face-blasting, as it ends off on more of a melodic note with \"Vigil,\" not necessarily melodic as it kicks you straight in the chest after Randy recites the first line of the Our Father. \"Vigil\" doesn't go for the punk attitude that the band likes to keep, going for more of a doom and gloom sound with a death metal backing to it. The riffage by Willie and Mark has gotten a lot better, with more variation in overall song structure. John does what John does and provides excellent backing throughout the tracks, having some flair here and there, but is a little lack luster on \"Vigil.\" Chris is fucking amazing throughout the entire album, keeping up the punk-infused death metal flair. \n\nProduction is average, but that doesn't mean that it is bad. It is far superior to New American Gospel, but it doesn't instantly stand out. Guitars are mixed very well, feeling more death metal than anything, giving me an early deathcore feel, but not to the degree that it makes me want to make myself go deaf. John's bass is mixed better and has less of a spring sound to it and sounds chunkier for sure, but is a little to quiet for my taste. Chris' drum set is better, but still needs work. It sounds muffled, but I can forgive as they gave it much more body on future records. The snare doesn't give me St. Anger flashbacks, of which is always great in my books. Nothing really clashes, and the instruments compliment each other nicely. Randy's vocals are mixed kind of quietly, but I can forgive.\n\nLyrics are very good, as most Lamb of God lyrics are written very well. \"Blood Junkie\" is a good example, remarking someone as a weak, self-centered individual that portrays themselves as the biggest thing, a possible jab at the Bush Administration with the Iraq conflict. Due to Randy's vocal improvements, what is being said in the songs can actually be understood. Instead of needing a lyric booklet, you can mostly understand what he is saying. Overall, a huge improvement from the last album.\n",
        "\nNew American Gospel is a very, very odd album in my eyes. Instrumentation, vocals, and composition pretty much collide with each other. It sounds as if they were still deciding whether or not to be punk or the abomination that is metalcore. But we end up with an album that is half punk, half metalcore, and a listening experience that is very confusing to try and take in. \n\nTo start off, the vocals are very poorly executed by Randy. Throughout the album you can hear his vocals get weaker. Normally vocals get weak over years of touring and album writing, but this is unprecedented. Randy is a strong vocalist and can hold his screams. His previous endeavors with Burn The Priest show his prowess at screaming, and are really well executed. On this album, however, they sound as if he is trying to do a mid-high, if that makes any sense. A good example is Black Label. At the very start of the song, Randy's vocals are held up pretty well, but near the very end his screams become strained, as if Randy had ran out of breath or something to that effect. Thankfully, he was able to ditch the highs that saw him through Burn The Priest for the most part and move onto a better suited mid-range for the rest of his career.\n\nThe instrumentation through this album is more or less lackluster. The riffs have tendency to sound like every other band that came out around this time, and this is a huge problem that I have with the record. Some of the songs have a slow intro, some 8th or 16th notes for the main riff, drum fills here and there, and a quick end or a fade out. The drum fills I have no problem with, as Chris Adler is an excellent drummer. Mark and Willie really scraped the bottom of the barrel on this record though. I'll give Willie a break as it really was his first time writing a record, but I've heard much better from Mark. John does a nice job at providing a kind of kick behind the guitars.\n\nThe production of this record is alright, but John's bass is mixed in a way that makes it sound a bit springy. The guitars are mixed well and give a really dirty atmosphere that, despite the records lack luster attempt, keeps me hooked for the majority of the record. Despite Randy's poor execution, his vocals are mixed well and don't take up too much space. The drums get me though, and in the wrong way. Chris' snare gives me a really bad St. Anger vibe and puts off the total listening experience. The rest of the drum kit sounds decent, but a little to quiet for my taste. But, as I said earlier, all of these factors clash with each other. The vocals sound and style, that being very punk, clash with the metalcore sounding guitars. The bass compliments the guitars and drums, as it should, but the drums do not compliment the guitars at all. The drumming goes for a very death feel and sounds odd with the metalcore guitars. \n\nThe lyrics are definitely one of the pluses on this album, but that really isn't saying much when it's harder to decipher than most other metal acts. Randy's \"decipherability\" is not bad with his more recent works, but with New American Gospel it is atrocious. That more or less falls back to vocals, not with lyric content. The lyrics on this record are very demeaning of humans, and possibly himself. On track two, \"A Warning,\" the lyricism describes someone, in the first person, as destructive towards people, and for people to stay away from him. It gives a good insight on this person's mentality, and all the songs portray a good scope of the band's mentality. It's such a shame that they were written for such a bad album.\n",
        "\nThis album is undeniably one of Lamb of God's best works. Good music tends to come from rough times, what with Randy Blythe, his charges of manslaughter and getting locked up. The majority of people believed that that would be the end of Lamb of God, but in 2015 they released VII: Sturm und Drang with goes to show that being accused of murder and going through hell won't stop them. \"512\" become a Lamb of God classic about Randy's time in prison, with hard hammering lyrics.\n\nThis was my welcoming into the wonderful world of metal, although I had no idea about the whole accidentally killing a fan situation until later. Being the youngin that I was, I saw a classmate who was almost always wearing the same Lamb of God shirt. Naturally, I got curious and eventually looked them up, it was the most intense music I have ever heard. Granted, Lamb of God is not the heaviest thing out there in the world of metal, but when you grow up listening to indie rock it is quite shocking. At first, I didn't really know how to feel about it as I had never heard vocals like that. I was drawn to it all the same. The vocals are discernible and angry, varying in volume depending on the song like the volume switches in \"Still Echoes.\" Overall, the vocals are good and don't sound too forced. Nothing is worse than the sound of a vocalist nearly silent wheezing in a record or having to take huge breaths that can be clearly heard. It feels as if Randy is pushing himself to do different things with his voice without it sounding too experimental and out of his comfort zone.\n\nWhat surprised me as a clueless future metalhead was how good the production quality for such loud music. The vocals don't blend into the instruments, but at the same time don't stand out too much either. You can clearly hear the notes of the guitars with no muddy blending of the music. The drums shine through as very well written but under control. Chris Adler did a great job on this album, creating great headbangers like \"Erase This\" and \"Engage the Fear Machine\". Overall, it seems like the communication and relationships between the different sounds and musicians seem very well executed. The guitars complement the drums and vocals very nicely which I feel like they had a lacking is some of their previous albums. My favorite song on this album is most definitely \"Embers.\" I especially like how Randy changes up his vocal style throughout the song. It truly seems to give it new layers as far as quality goes.\n\nLamb of God's VII: Sturm und Drang includes newer lyrical experimentation by Randy Blythe, great drum work by Chris Adler and such a great heavy hitting sound. This is such a good album to be for my welcoming in the world of metal. Nothing could stop Lamb of God from writing a great album fueled by grief, anger, and pain. The passion expressed through this album is just incredible.\n",
        "\nThis album is near perfect. Where at the time bands were often going for a ripoff melodic death metal sound or metalcore or a core-something sound of sorts, Lamb of God was anchored in traditional American metal while incorporating elements of the contemporary scene with just as much measure. This album is absolute balance, first and foremost. It's clearly strongly Slayer-influenced, it's indeed got breakdowns... but it utilizes those influences rather than abuses them, and how much a riff on this album may bring to mind Slayer it'll still be distinct and original all the while. Every song is fresh, totally distinct. Within the songs, there are no fillers, every section is just as exciting as the previous, as the next. Each song has identity, drive, and life. It's authentic stuff with true spirit. Each song is filled with just enough material that it's well beyond the ordinary verse/chorus/verse/chorus format but never ventures into untidy experimental territory at any point, the music is made to bear a certain complexity while feeling purely catchy, never a headache. The songs and entire album are totally under control and it's obvious the song-writers were on top of their craft here when it comes to management and pacing. Just excellently \"directed\". They give you a glimpse of all the different facets and ideas of the Ashes of the Wakes sound, but never rehash or repeat or heavily emphasize any of it. This is no self-indulgent album, it's a real treat.\n\nMusically this album contains the obvious backbone traditional thrash metal foundation, but beyond the other 'core-ish' elements there's some really unique work going on as far as surprisingly smooth alternative guitar parts ('Break You' verse) or even a taste for industrial: the brilliant ending to 'One Gun' depicts a dark bleak spiraling descent and they went through the trouble of using processed drums, or the occasional bass boom added for effect. 'Break You' also contains a section that is closer to a kind of thrashy black metal, while 'Omerta' is strongly doom-metal tainted. There's thought put into each section, every inch of the album is looked at closely and the arrangements are a key-part of this masterpiece.\n\nThe riffs vary from potent power-chord rides to the sinister Slayeresque iconic riffs, to the much sludgier southern tones, from fast to slow, to some of the weirdest riffs (the infamous \"vomit riff\" on 'Hourglass' or that insane verse riff on 'The Faded Line', or a couple of riffs off the incredible Ashes of the Wakes instrumental), to exotic sounding leads (Faded Line breakdown), to easier/catchier riffage as on the bouncy and fun opener Laid to Rest. The vocals are absolutely superb and somehow fit the music despite their rare quality, the drums are absolutely legendary in sound, precision and writing - the guitar tone is crunchy and the production just fits the sonic spirit of the album just right: abrasive, polished but not overproduced. Raw but nice simultaneously.\n\nOne of the best metal albums ever, all subgenres together.\n",
        "\nAmerican Lamb of God is a band that is seen as one of the best metal bands in the world by a big part of the heavy music scene. Any release by these masters of groove and progressiveness is looked forward to with a lot of anticipation by many. So a lot of people were excited about the release of their EP The Duke. On the album we get served 2 new tracks and 3 live recordings of songs from their last full release VII: Sturm und Drang. \u201cOnly 2?\u201d I hear you wonder. Well, considering this is not just any little filler EP to not be completely quiet in between full releases might help you get over that fact. This album shows just how fucking great these guys are, cause this is a remembrance piece for a recently deceased friend and meant to raise awareness about leukaemia and for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (LLS) and BeTheMatch.\n\nNow the music itself\u2026 as I said already, this EP is dedicated to their fan and friend and more particular the first song The Duke. Randy Blythe about the track:\n\n \u201cA little while ago I became friends with a fan named Wayne Ford \u2014 he was terminal \u2014 leukemia. I talked with him often, even video chatted him into the studio. He was very calm about his impending death, and we discussed it very openly. I learned a lot from him. This song is for him.\u201c\n\nBlythe already surprised us on Sturm und Drang with the clean vocals on Overlord and if you found the sound pleasing back then, get ready for this one. In my humble opinion the clean vocals that he\u2019s putting down here, are a thousand fold stronger than before. A very somber song (\u201cNo one lives forever\u2026\u201d) with an incredibly pleasing and soothing vibe, I could put it on repeat for quite a few times. As a completely a-typical Lamb Of God song a great, still groovy and rather catchy hard rock/heavy metal creation with Blythe pulling out a higher pitched scream when promising to never die. Near the end of the song they pull out some heavy riffs and a solo to burst into a more Lamb Of God bridge. I\u2019m really looking forward to see if they might attempt more music in this direction.\n\nCulling goes back to a more classic Lamb Of God sound in which they crank up the thrash metal and usual old school groove metal they\u2019re so damn good at. It\u2019s a heavy hitter and feels like a track that could get a crowd wild at one of their gigs. Simply great work we can\u2019t get enough of! The live tracks are decent enough too, they bring across the burning hot epicness that is a show by these masters of groove metal, the energy is almost tangible.\n\nLamb Of God silences our hunger a little bit by some new work and at the same time raises awareness for an illness that struck one of their fans and a personal friend. Besides all of that The Duke brings a promise of further greatness to be in the future. These guys are everything that is right in this world and I urge you to support them and if possible the cause they\u2019re trying to put your attention to.\n\noriginally published on www.grimmgent.com\n",
        "\nSacrament is Lamb of God's big leap to popularity, and it's easy to see why with this album. The songs are better organized, hit harder, and drag far less. The riffs are more fully formed and downright engaging and groovy. The music as a whole is more memorable and concise than before with some songs being scaled back to three minutes to make the album run more smoothly. LOG was already pretty well known here in Virginia, but this helped them get to new heights of popularity. They made an album that distills their groovy aggression into songs that pull no punches and make you remember the hits you took and the hooks you heard.\n\nThis album sounds bigger, grander, and more varied than the albums preceding it. This is especially evident on \"Walk With Me in Hell\" which is a gigantic, anthems song that could Herald the coming of the apocalypse with its tsunami-high builds and stomping groove riffs akin to a fast march. It's truly a massive song. The next three songs opt for a catchier delivery and more emphasis on riffage, especially on the rumbling brawler \"Redneck\" and the massive and spiteful \u201cAgain We Rise\" with its low-pitched and explosive choir vocals. These three songs also have a large amount of lyrical bile to dispense, as well as the next one. This album takes aim at common arrogance and bashes down hard against people who are very proud but have hardly anything to be proud of. If you\u2019re from the south you know these kinds of people, the posers who act like rednecks when they're well off, or the folks who try to play the freedom-loving rebel, but fellate conformity and tradition. These songs take aim at that proud-yet-impotent mindset, with \"Again We Rise\" being bitterly sarcastic in its reference to the phrase \"The South shall rise again\" spouted off by so many so-called \u201crebels\u201d who Blythe puts down in the song\u2019s lyrics. They attack the concept of excess, useless pride in other forms as well with agile riffing going underneath Blythe's bile-filled lyrics. Many of the groovier and catchier songs also have a lot of their bile being self-directed, lest somebody in this band gets too full of themselves or ends up hopelessly strung out. Almost every song has a bone to pick with somebody, and the swift, swinging riffing lets you know that fierce punch is coming your way. With the amount of sheer guitar muscle behind all of this using large-sounding, skillful grooves that hammer with massive blunt force.\n\nMusic-wise this is Lamb of God\u2019s lunge towards a much more accessible, yet massive sound. While easy to get into and understand, the songs all have either much more punch or much more variance than seen on their older albums. Large, impressive rhythms and grand, anthemic songs fill the album and give it such strength. They have far more dynamic to them than before and as a result, the songs don't get boring with more concise and less winding song structures and tempo shifts that are executed pretty smoothly. Songs like \"Blacken the Cursed Sun\" and \"Descending\" employ doom elements with large, imposing atmosphere and a low, rumbling sound that really builds the tension to a high point. Each song has its catchy riffing and a nuke's worth of punch, the rousing choir choruses add strength and make you feel as though you are staring down an army poised to charge. The ways that many of these songs introduce themselves are just fiery and get you pumped for the rest of the song with a good sense of momentum and tension. Sacrament is the album where Lamb of God\u2019s strengths are brought to the forefront with tighter songs and grander sounds. It's an album that where the Adler brothers, Campbell, Blythe, and Morton give us their all with a groove metal album that goes for catchiness, massive sound, and a fierce punch.\n\nThis feels like a super-sized Pantera-styled groove album with the kind of grandiosity you'd see in later Machine Head albums. (I wonder if this album influenced The Blackening?) It's got the ferocity of their previous albums with more catchiness and a greater variety of tones and tempos to make this feel thrilling and complete. This is a damn fine album and makes me extremely happy of what my fellow Virginians have pulled off. This album will energize you and rip you to pieces. Every song has something to offer and I can't pick out any filler. This is one of the strongest groove metal pieces of the mid-2000\u2019s. It's big, it's catchy, it's energized, it's vicious, and it balances strong, imposing composition out with simple, swinging groove attitude.\n",
        "\nLamb of God's third album, Ashes of the Wake is an album that focuses on war and the not-so-noble things done during it. LOG have been mixing Pantera groove with death metal-tinged metalcore since they began and here you see a very even mixture of these influences result in some cool songs, even if the album as a whole feels rather monotonous. Honestly, if the tones and tempos would change up more from song to song, we'd have something that feels more even and engaging.\n\nIf there is something these guys do well, it's blending groove riffs with thrash rhythms. Many of the songs sit between marching and swinging to emphasize the martial themes of this album. Some downright nasty riffing, destructive atmosphere and breakdowns on \"Hourglass\", \"Now You've Got Something to Die For\", and \"The Faded Line\", all of which are swinging and destructive songs with plenty of winding riffs. The songs themselves all over the album feel pretty winding, but this can wear on someone listening to this from beginning to end. There are songs that go wrong with this and just feel repetitive, like the plodding \"Omerta\" where it just feels like the same thing over and over for almost 5 minutes. Much of the later album feels less energized because they use a similar tone all throughout and tend to use the same chugging riff for a minute straight, really wearing them out. Rowdier songs like \"Remorse is for the Dead\", especially with its still, soft build and explosive release of fast pummeling riffs, bring the energy back and make the Adlers' playing feel like their putting their energy into these, brutish march-like rhythms. Blythe gets the job done as far as vocals come, but like the Adlers, he does best when he varies his tones and tempos (especially going faster/higher) but like the two brothers, he's stuck in mid-pace mode for much of this album without much change. The album opens on several good songs and ends with a good one, but lacks for variety in the middle. The chugga-chugga can only keep me going for so long, man. I need some more grooves!\n\nThis album has some quality slug-out tunes on it, but otherwise is at a loss for variation. Tonal shifts are rare and this can make this album feel plodding and laborious. Some shifts in tone and tempo would've helped tremendously and made this a much more satisfying listen. Ashes of the Wake is an album that does fine some of the time, but just really needs to shake things up every now and again due to tonal monotony. I'd still recommend this based on \"The Faded Line\" and several other tracks that warrant a few replays. They really are pretty gnarly.\n",
        "\nThere are some that believe that great art requires hardship and suffering. And those of us following the saga involving Lamb Of God's singer Randy Blythe's manslaughter cases, the question arose what sort, and if any, music the band would come up with after the ordeal had finished. True to form, the band's new album VII: Sturm Und Drang's album seems to adhere to the adage that art needs pain. \n\nLet's face it, while Resolution and Wrath were good albums, in many ways they were safe and comfortable. The band seemed to be heading down the same path of cut and paste albums that plague a lot of the big players these days.\n\nVII: Sturm Und Drang sees Lamb Of God at their most inspired for a long time. For the first time since Sacrament they throw in new elements including a new willingness to tone it down occasionally (toned down by Lamb Of God standards that is!). \"Overlord\" channels Alice In Chains with its vocal harmonies whilst Chino Moreno (Deftones) is tastefully incorporated on \"Embers.\" \n\nThe classic Lamb Of God groove metal numbers with their massive riffs are still here, even in the mellower tunes. The songs are less conventional and thrashy than Resolution and in many cases go back to Sacrament's Southern style groove or the more hardcore tinged As The Palaces Burn. The result is some of the most instantly memorable melodies since Sacrament.\n\nAnd the band literally sound like a fire's been lit under their collective derrieres. The delivery is sharp, precise, and intense. Randy in particular and he sounds like a man with something to prove, especially on \"512\", a song about his time in a Czech prison. As such, even more standard Lamb of God numbers like \"Engage The Fear Machine\" sound revitalized.\n\nWhilst this album won't blow the metal world away like their early works, it's certainly a great addition to their catalogue. It's refreshing to see a band willing to go out of their comfort zone and pull off some new sounds. And it's equally great to see an established band such as Lamb Of God get back that passion that attracted the fans to them in the first place.\n",
        "\nJust for a moment (and it's a really good moment), you think that you've accidentally been sold a new Crowbar album in place of the Lamb of God one you thought you were getting. It's not Kirk Windstein on vocals, that much is clear, but it's a beast who you don't recognize as Randy Blythe either. And...then the signature Chris Adler drum fill bursts in followed by the signature Lamb of God guitar riff and you realize that it was just a ploy to wake you up before the main course of 'Resolution' arrived on your table.\n\nI don't know about the rest of you guys, but hearing 'Straight for the Sun' open up a LoG album was akin to being jumped on and pinned to the floor by a 45 kilogram wrestler wearing nothing except her bra and knickers - totally surprising and more than a little titillating. What happens during the rest of 'Resolution' is that we slowly start to recover from the initial shock and discover that the assailant - while not quite possessed of a hairy lip and a pair of crossed eyes - is aggressive, energetic, and entirely unsure what to do with her position of power. The sad thing about an album like this is that LoG really tried to do everything in their power to make their formula fresh, including acoustic guitars, clean singing, punchy solos, and that doom introduction to steer away from the predictable course on which their ship was headed. Some of those experiments are really welcome and add a much-needed blast of energy to the album, but looking at 'Resolution' as a whole, we see 14 songs spread over 56 minutes and sigh heavily at how easy it is to guess where this is going.\n\nWhat I consider LoG's biggest problem (and it's been a problem since 'Sacrament' came out in 2006) is that their thrashy/groovy metalcore has lacked danger for the most part and fails to inspire a strong reaction beyond mild approval from someone seasoned in heavy metal's salty waters. What this album attempted was a stab at changing the formula on a few songs and an effort to hype up the typical band sound on the other songs. There's more natural aggression on songs like 'Cheated', 'The Undertow', and 'Desolation' than either of the two preceding albums achieved, while the production keeps just a bit of dirt under the fingernails to ensure the scrambling riffs and thundering drums aren't missing the point. This means that the anger and energy sound a bit more legitimate this time around, convincing me about 60% that LoG really mean it (it's still not exactly the same level of pissed off as Deicide, nor even quite there with The Haunted or Chimaira), even if the vocals have had too much studio time spent on them to feel like the real thing. The guitars do almost nothing new to what occurred in the past, except for a more visceral quality to the soloing, which does sound like the real thing, adding streaks of fire to the likes of 'Ghost Walking', 'Invictus', and 'The Undertow'. Chris Adler is quite probably the most frustrating drummer in metal, since he has a lot of skill and can play both in classic styles and his own unique one but is so stuck in LoG-world that he doesn't come up with much new from one album to the next. It's also my own theory that John Campbell was shot and stuffed nearly 10 years ago, because his bass has practically failed to appear on any album since 'Ashes of the Wake'.\n\n'Resolution' is still worth your time, however, because there are probably LoG's best songs clattering about roomily in this overlong album. Cutting at least two or three songs would have been advisable ('Guilty', 'The Number Six', and 'Visitation' are unremarkable and thus would be my picks), so that the quality could shine through more clearly and the experiments would remain interesting even when - as with the closing 'King Me' - they aren't fully successful. What I love about the opening song and the closing streak from 'Insurrection' onwards is that there are small risks taken and copious rewards harvested, such as in the clear highlight 'To the End', which injects a sense of incredible fun and energy into a song about uncelebrated death, or 'Insurrection', which manages to tower up more threateningly on Blythe's clean vocals and ringing clean guitar than all of the screaming and pace of the other songs. Just as Chimaira managed with 'The Age of Hell', LoG found that they could turn a stock formula back into a fascinating one by tinkering with the pieces and I wish they had done so even more, because those are easily the most memorable parts of the album and perhaps even their career. With 'Resolution', these guys almost got it right and gave themselves a whole new playing field, but it seems LoG were just too cautious to commit to the possibilities that they hinted at here.\n",
        "\nSome things never change right? In Lamb of God's world, Randy Blythe is unjustly imprisoned for more than a year, he comes out, they record an album, some of the songs are about his incarceration, and yet a song like '512' sounds materially and emotionally the same as everything they have ever recorded. What the hell? You can't exactly argue with the sincerity of the lyrics, because the guy's been there and done that, but the sincerity of the performances sound utterly uniform and arguably less intense than anything previous to this album.\n\n'512', as a Lamb of God song, contains exactly zero surprises. It has a vaguely dissonant chugging breakdown that opens the song and reappears partway through, a drawling voiceover, a rolling groove riff, a chuggy riff with drums playing round the simple guitars, a scream that leads into a roared out chorus, and a solo that sounds a bit like a long spastic Southern blues fill, though it doesn't exactly put any wind in the band's sails. The production is so flat and slick that I'm not even sure guitars should be that round without simply becoming marbles. Everything here is done with none of the lessons learned from that difficult time, just a mere repetition of their old sound, which has gradually been becoming less and less dangerous since 'Sacrament'.\n\nI really hope the album 'Sturm and Drang' is better than this, because '512' is not worth bothering with. Boo.\n",
        "\nLamb of God have been around for a long time now and there are some things that have solidified about the band. One of those things is that they are never going to alter their musical style by any significant margin, even if they may have slid ever further towards commercial markets since 'Sacrament' upped the level of polish and precision in 2006. 'As the Palaces Burn' stands as perhaps the band's heaviest album, building on the violent and sludgy tendencies of their debut with a more focused, thrashy assault. I really don't have a lot of good words to say about the poorly-produced 'New American Gospel', though this is a lot more successful at seizing the listener complicitly, rather than some kind of ugly ear rape, with its thick grooves and sharp riffs. However, nowadays it shows its age.\n\nThat's the first place I'm going to take you - back to 2003 to examine how things have changed. At the beginning of the century, this kind of music was fresh and different, giving a monstrously modern makeover to Slayer's thrash and At the Gates' melodeath, including a new focus on rhythm and groove, which necessarily cut the pace of the former and the classic leads of the latter to forge a more muscular (and arguably less pure) sound. What surprises, 12 years on, is that modern Lamb of God still have a lot of the same features. Those scrambling palm-muted riffs in '11th Hour' would fit comfortably on any of the later albums, and the metalcore tendencies were also firmly developed, as can be heard towards the end of that song. The reason that 'As the Palaces Burn' remains a little more interesting than those later albums is that it presents those features with an energy and danger that has largely disappeared from the band's well-rehearsed sound. When 'For Your Malice' escalates suddenly from mid-paced chug to a flurry of death metal, I'm still surprised after all this time, which I could never imagine myself saying of 'Redneck' or 'Ghost Walking'. This album's unpredictability is its strongest feature, since we can still hear the sound developing as the album progresses and we are witness to the inspiration that these five guys had.\n\nSomething that puzzles me about 'As the Palaces Burn' is that it was produced by Devin Townsend. The erstwhile Strapping Young Lad mastermind has never made any music that sounds as groovy or as concentrated as this, nor does the face-to-concrete style particularly sound like he was involved. The washes of sound and deep texturing that he made a feature of his own albums are miles away from this brutal and simplistic sound: one can hear every element of Lamb of God as though they are playing through the wall, certainly nothing is processed as much as it would eventually become, and there's a rawness about the band too that was too pronounced on the debut and too distant later. The beginning of 'A Devil in God's Country' is a great example of this, with Chris Adler giving a lightning fill before the serrated guitars crash over in a choppy thrashcore surge of riffs, John Campbell's bass all the while growling threateningly behind them. Randy Blythe is much, much better than on 'New American Gospel', having sorted out most of the problems with his diction, his sloppy roars, and - some rather preachy lyrics aside - is in control of every song.\n\nThis production gives the band a lot of energy and means they have to play skilfully and to the point in order to succeed, which thankfully happens. At 38 minutes, 'As the Palaces Burn' is by no means a long album, but the busy playing makes everything fly past in a blur, never dwelling on any riff or section for too long and Chris Adler hurrying everyone along with a furious performance behind the kit. The best songs are at the beginning and in the middle part of the album, with 'A Devil in God's Country' and 'Boot Scraper' especially taking my fancy, alongside the already classic 'Ruin'. We are mostly here for riffs and those songs deliver the best with a creative fury that few other modern bands understood quite as well as Lamb of God in 2003. The closing 'Vigil' also has one hell of a doom/sludge riff and a raging blast of energy that closes the album in great style. There are several parts of songs that tend towards purer metalcore and even the kind of rhythmic fuckery that The Dillinger Escape Plan indulge in (I'm looking at 'Blood Junkie' here), plus the Pantera groove influence is pronounced at times, actually dragging these songs down because they lose all momentum and direction. As such, 'Blood Junkie' falls lowest on my list of recommendations, as do the title track and '11th Hour', which don't deliver the hooks present in the other songs.\n\n'As the Palaces Burn' isn't the most beautiful of metal albums, but it satisfies a need for chuggy thuggery and hooky anger, plus it took several of the new century's genres a few steps further. As a brief smash and grab effort, it pays off, though more time spent in this style might wear thin quickly. Arguably, we see a band who are here still developing, and, while this kind of release has been left behind by the modern metal scene, it still maintains an important place at its origins.\n",
        "\nFor the past three and a half years, Virginia's Lamb of God has gone through some really fucked up shit overseas in Europe. With Randy Blythe getting locked-up and accused for murdering a fan some years ago, most fans probably thought that was the end for Lamb of God in 2012. Now, three years after Randy's ultimately brief incarceration and freeing, Lamb of God are back with probably their most anticipated album ever. Everyone including myself waited a long time for this album to hit the shelves, just to hear the result of the band's recent struggles. On top of it, their last album Resolution was a bit mediocre, so this album also had to prove that Lamb still is in the game.\n\nDuring this past spring, Lamb fans around the world have been fed with as much as five different tracks from the album before its release. Yes, that is half of the actual album. Personally I criticized whoever was responsible for that because that kind of took away a lot of the anticipation, not to mention the first-time-listening experience being a bit ruined. Anyway, these five tracks showed great progress for the band and were all of high quality. I was really strung-up on the eerie and emotional \"512\" (named after Randy's prison cell number) and the inventive \"Overlord\", which rocks an Alice in Chains-vibe with Randy doing real, clean vocals. The rest of album is a bit experimental at times as well, and I really get a feeling that Lamb is intentionally moving on towards a more \"mature\" sound. This is evident in most tracks which are more chugging-heavy rather than blast-heavy, like their previous album Wrath was for instance.\n\nThe production job is clean and heavy. The band's now long-time producer Josh Wilbur once again handled this album, and I'm really satisfied with his work on every Lamb album so far. To me, his work with Lamb is so essential that I'm ready to call him a sixth \"ghost member\" of the band, and this album is his best production work yet. This album is certainly not as over-produced as Ashes Of The Wake or Sacrament were (both of them were produced by Machine), but it's cleaner than Wrath and better mastered than Resolution, which had some annoying digital clipping.\n\nIn the end I am very satisfied with this album. The band really brings out the best of themselves this time around, both playing-wise and in writing/arrangements. The band apparently wrote the stuff together this time around instead of individually, which I welcome as a successful outcome. Chris Adler and Randy Blythe kind of feel like the shining stars of this album, however, with Chris taking his awesome drum work further, and Randy really pushing himself to become more than just a screamer. This album is ultimately a very strong effort that feels like an actual band product, rather than a cocktail with a bit of everyone here and there, like the last album.\n\nTo my ears, Lamb of God has really topped itself this time, and Sturm Und Drang really is one of their finest efforts. The only album I would possibly prefer over this one would be Wrath, but that one is much more one-dimensional on the other hand. I guess I'll let my mood decide whenever I feel for some Lamb of God. And be sure to get the digipak edition - the bonus tracks are worth it!\n\nCheck-outs: Erase This, 512, Embers, Overlord, Delusion Pandemic.\n",
        "\nDo you feel Lamb of God have lost a lot of edge over the past decade? Like the fire just isn't there anymore and that they now sound a bit too comfortable and smug at their craft? Well, this album might just be what you \u2013 like me \u2013 have long been yearning for. If you've never warmed to the Virginians' brand of coarse, somewhat dryly delivered metalcore/groove metal before, Sturm und Drang (how's that for a title by an American major label act?) won't sway you even a little bit. But for fans, served up here is quite simply the strongest set of songs they've put out since Ashes of the Wake. Especially after the creative nadir and real dud that was their previous album, I can't say I expected this kind of quality from them ever again. \n\nAside from the half-ballad curveball track \u201cOverlord\u201d, really nothing here is changed about the band's highly recognizable, bluntly \u201crawr-rawr\u201d southern-ass style, almost like the Pantera of our time. However, vocalist Randy Blythe going through legal trouble, imprisonment and basically hell since the last album (in turn putting the whole band's future in jeopardy) I guess was bound to leave some sort of mark, and the one positive outcome for everyone involved is the sense of a knife to the throat effect here, as if spurring on the band to write and perform with their livelihood threatened if they can't bounce back from things (the title sure seems to reflect this). Actually, on one hand, in terms of musical direction the album doesn't distinguish itself much from the rest of their discography, not unlike 2012's crappy Resolution. This doesn't have the more atmospheric and melodic approach of Sacrament, or the consistently aggressive directness of Wrath \u2013 this is just a very general, \u201cvanilla\u201d Lamb of God sound at its core. But the added sense of urgency and emotional turmoil is definitely there, resulting in songs like the bleak, haunting \u201c512\u201d \u2013 the soundtrack to your psyche being slowly torn to shreds right there, and a newborn LoG classic. Among the more straightforward stuff, \u201cErase This\u201d is simply rousing, with riffage both highly melodic and razor sharp, recalling the group's masterwork As the Palaces Burn in its intensity. The distinctly Wrath sounding \u201cStill Echoes\u201d at first appeared to me as rather standard fare for a choice of first single, but subsequent listens have revealed a genuineness and drive to it, again one that hasn't quite been present over the past few releases. What I'm saying is, they now play it like they fucking mean it and have not put out another album just to have a career. Because I'm such a big fan, I have to pour some love over Chris Adler; ever Lamb of God's instrumental highlight and an essential component, his drumming impresses as always on the album. Those double kicks still flow like pouring water and for head-bobbing groove there's probably no one with better instincts. The incredibly strong material he is utilized for this time around makes you notice and appreciate his work that much more. \n\nI'd be lying if I said I didn't miss some of the especially primal, uncompromising bluntness of the first three albums (under the LoG moniker), which did make up a lot of the band's charm for me. Of course, with age and maturity comes a delivery that is not quite as brash and more on par with what you'd expect from one of metal's most mainstream acts. But with songwriting this strong and a newly injected spirit to the proceedings (albeit under tragic circumstances), I'm really the last to complain and hey, it's not like they've gotten soft on us or anything. After a close call like that, it's amazing to have them back in such fine form. For your fill of stomping, American goddamn metal, look no further.\n",
        "\nYou have heard of Lamb of God. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re a diehard death metal fan or if you\u2019re a prog person, we\u2019re all in agreement that Lamb of God have made the step up to be one of those artists that everyone knows and mostly everyone enjoys. It\u2019s been well earned too: a string of successful albums have led them to big headline tours across the globe as well as headlining festivals among the likes of Slayer. Everything was going so well for them until the cataclysmic event that nearly bankrupted the band and had their singer imprisoned. In 2010 a fan rushed the stage during a show in Prague, Czech Republic and was reportedly pushed offstage by singer, Randy Blythe and later succumbed to brain injuries. 2 years later the band returned for another tour and left without Randy. 5 weeks in custody, 2 bails and numerous days of trial led to Randall. D. Blythe being found not guilty to the unfortunate death of one of his fans. What an ordeal. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve all exhaled our long sigh of relief we can celebrate the new intake of breath with Lamb of God\u2019s new album since Randy\u2019s acquittal. Lyrically, Randy raises the bar on his vocal capabilities than on previous albums. Quite simply, he sounds thoroughly pissed off in Strum Und Drang. This is resonated both via the typical Lamb Of God shrieks in vicious tracks such as 512, which describes the cell number and the effect imprisonment has on you. Affronting songs such as Erase This and Footprints heighten the fury that only a former prisoner could summon. However his anger can still be sparked in tentative moments of Strum Und Drang. The fatiguing Overlord begins with some new genuine clean vocals but against the dark, bluesy melodies of his band members an aura of solemnity is echoed. Perhaps this suggests the implication of sombreness that Randy feels towards the Czech family who have lost their son while the sudden rushes of strident grooves represent the anger of unavoidable responsibility he feels for the tragedy towards the end of the song.\n\nRandy plays such a focused part of Strum Und Drang that at times you forget the talent of the other 4 members. Delusion Pandemic brings out the thrash side in Lamb Of God and also fixes the spotlight upon Chris Adler\u2019s ballistic drumming abilities while Still Echoes enhances their unique and recognised sound. The latter sounds like a continuation of their previous album, Resolution, as Willie Adler and Mark Morton\u2019s harmonics swerve around the vicious vocals. Even John Campbell\u2019s brooding bass makes a significant appearance in Embers which is prominent in delivering the ominous end to the song.\n\nEmbers also happens to emphasize Lamb Of God\u2019s experimental capabilities. The strange inclusion of Chino Moreno (Deftones) adds a lofty dimension to the music. His vocals reflect the shining guitars yet are contradictory to Randy\u2019s usual screams. This is a similar effect in Torches which features Greg Puciato (The Dillinger Escape Plan). Both vocalists are renowned for their raging approach on singing but here we see their lethargic natures. It\u2019s a nice touch but most fans have become too attuned to the typical angry spikes in Lamb of God\u2019s singing to fully appreciate the uneasy vocal shifts.\n",
        "\nIt would be fair to expect big changes in the Lamb of God camp - after all, main man Randy Blythe has been through a hell of a lot in recent years (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you probably shouldn't be reading this review). After a spell in prison and a 3-year hiatus, most bands would certainly return to the fold with either a matured or ruined sound. From the recent reviews I've read about Lamb of God's brand new \"Sturm Und Drang\" (A German art movement in case you were wondering...), it was looking as if they might have fallen into the latter category. Then I decided to check out the new single \"Overlord\" - where I started to agree with many of the critics, though not to such a strong extent. THEN I heard the rest of the album...\n\nDid the skeptics only hear that infamous single?! Because, aside from \"Overlord\" and the middle-8 of \"Embers\" - this is just solid, galloping, hard-hitting Lamb of God straight out of \"Ashes of the Wake\" territory! The drums still retain their metallic clang, the guitar/bass combo still crank out vicious riff after riff - though this time slightly more complex in their melodic structure (see \"Delusion Pandemic\"), and Randy's voice...well, the man's a beast, we're all aware of this. The production quality highlights all of these elements and the album is mixed superbly.\n\nThe only signs of gradual progression lie in the previously mentioned moments. There's a lot of divided opinion regarding the single \"Overlord\" and it's obvious why. The verses sound like an odd Danzig/Alice In Chains hybrid, and Randy's vocal style is very out-of-character. But man the fuck up, accept the difference, and take this track for what it is: a sprawling, moody ode with a furious, classic LOG middle section, and the greatest breakdown the band has ever written. That's right, even better than \"Now You've Got Something To Die For\". The second half of \"Embers\" is admittedly a little odd. The guest vocals from Chino (yeah, Deftones!) sound uncomfortable, and it's an anti-climactic ending to an otherwise blazing track.\n\nLyrically, this may not be any big departure from the usual fare. A bit of political gripe here, a bit of misanthropy there. But the dark horse on \"Sturm Und Drang\" is clearly track 3, \"512\". Blythe's experience in a Czech prison is released through some very poetic lyricism in a, surprisingly, non-violent way. This mood is reflected in the music too, bearing striking resemblance to \"Walk With Me In Hell\". \n\nThough the whole affair may come across as being a little too brief, it's important to remember that it's not making an impactful statement - \"Sturm Und Drang\" should just be regarded as a continuation of the classic LOG sound that we've grown so attached to. From the slicing opening riff of \"Still Echoes\", through the anthemic \"Footprints\", right to the heralding finale of \"Torches\" - Adler and co. are not trying to make a grand entrance, or reinvent the metal wheel. They just want to record some goddamn true American heavy metal and fuck everyone else. \n\nOkay, I confess. There's one more un-LOG-esque segment of this album, and now I feel I've justified the main offenders - I'll move on to it... The epic closer \"Torches\" is brooding and menacing, but never reaches full-on metal mayhem. It's just the perfect way to keep listener's tongues salivating for more! As Blythe bellows in the chorus of \"Footprints\": How the fuck did you think this would end?!\n\n\"It's business as usual,\nWe're bringing you disaster in high-def!\"\n",
        "\nThe opening riff of 'In Your Words' is going to hit you one of two ways. Either you are going to believe that you have found the gates of Paradise/Hell (there's no accounting for taste) and are plummeting through them at the fastest speed, like, ever; or you are going to believe that Lamb of God is being led to the slaughter, from which we will eat delicious lamb chops later tonight. As per usual, my answer must be somewhere between the two, because when I bought this album I was not the same metal fan that I am now, and I basically loved it, whereas now I don't. Perhaps it's true that a meeting place like the Metal Archives has soured me somewhat towards bands like LoG, whose presentation in the mainstream metal world is of a band with a lot of skill in a rightfully lofty position, while on this kind of \"true\" metal forum (true gets scaremarks because it's so subjective), that skill and position is ridiculed because the band are modern, often generic, and sometimes hamfisted. What it is now my job to remember is whether I actually enjoy this music, regardless of the many views of its consumers.\n\nAs such, I need to work out which bits of LoG are tasty young lamb and which bits are chewy old mutton. This album has a lot of that swinging, rumbling kind of groove that works very nicely at higher tempos and very poorly at lower tempos. The loping chorus riff of 'Fake Messiah' is a prominent example; it crops up in 'Grace' and 'Choke Sermon' and 'Broken Hands', and so on until I've named every song on the album barring the instrumental opener and the mildly dfferent closer. I kind of like it, even if I'm not a big fan of the metalcore chug-chug-chug-big fill riff, because LoG are actually pretty good at it and create a decent momentum that is good for moshpit and bedroom alike. Then there's another part that is the scrambling, lots-of-notes riff that is supposed to be brutal because it's (kind of) fast and sounds heavy at first, but actually I could make two or three of them up on guitar now and I haven't played for a couple of years. There are bad ones of those, like the main riff to 'Grace', which is just too many notes repeated too many times, and there are better ones, like at the end of 'Contractor', which actually rages and mercifully isn't milked for the entire song. On the other hand, there is maybe one clunky, chug and thump riff per song: I guess these are there to show the technicality of the band and to display their awesome rhythm section, but this is exactly what a band with an awesome rhythm section doesn't need to do, since they can make normal riffs sound interesting if they try. These are redundant and I really dislike the sound of Chris Adler's kit, which might well be disintegrating as he records his parts on 'Wrath'.\n\nSo, the general style of rhythm playing is decidely mixed and fairly repetitive, while the guitar tone easily outdoes that of drums and bass (once again, John Campbell is rather a passenger for most of the album) with an aggressive, crunchy tone that just avoids sounding too processed. However, the performance of the lead players is also mixed. There is a more concerted effort to use solos for flavour on this album than in the past, where they did not appear in every song: here, the guitar leads feature on almost all the tracks and are melodic for the most part, bringing songs not to a higher level of intensity but to a moment of release. This release is necessary as Randy Blythe doesn't actually provide enough drama and contrast to give the album flow or emotional dynamics. He never sings clean, which is fine, though he also sings with the continued intention of giving everything to every line and pushes his power onto the listener in such a way that I've mostly stopped listening to him by the end of the fourth song. There just isn't any change up in his style, as if he worried so much about being brutal and taking his lyrics seriously that he left part of his performance behind. Only the slower closing track, which demands some changes in approach, shows a more varied side to his role.\n\nThe songs on 'Wrath' thus have a slight problem of sounding similar. The same kind of groove runs through a large part of the album, meaning that I become a little confused about the distinction between tracks 6-9, though they do have some differences in approach. The band may have made a slight error in running order by putting the noticeably different songs at the beginning and end of the record, so that the middle section stays at a level intensity for a long time, until the acoustics kick in for 'Reclamation'. As such, the first tracks have the greatest impact, and it is probably the four opening songs (not including the instrumental) that get my nod, along with the sprightly and catchy 'Choke Sermon' that is the most gratifying song for repeated listens. 'Choke Sermon' succeeds because it remains brisk throughout, doesn't include any needless rhythmic demonstrations and contains memorable vocal and riff hooks, plus a decent solo.\n\n'Wrath' isn't really an album to listen to with too much attention, since the output can be samey and lack careful planning, but it is suitable for general listening, when the energetic songs and swinging grooves can be absorbed at medium focus. There are some good songs, though many could be made better by removing some generic ideas and including more detail and subtlety in the riff and vocal departments. Nothing offensive, just nothing too exciting either.\n",
        "\nAh, Lamb of God. Has anyone ever approached Lamb of God with anything resembling calmness? Fanboys and haters everywhere: surely a band who polarise opinion in such a way should be very special indeed? A band who have an utterly unique and innovative style? Well, those bands tend to be ignored by most people. Lamb of God are no such thing, neither truly unique or innovative, but perhaps, just perhaps, 'Ashes of the Wake' was an important contribution to the heavy metal encyclopaedia, and perhaps there is a reason why this band's entry is so well thumbed.\n\nThe first LoG album was shit and had awful production, while the second was a vast improvement and had a medium-good production. This album finally gives the band a sound that plays to their strengths and doesn't leave the guitars feeling lifeless and over-polished, like on the following 'Sacrament'. They sound heavier and more in-your-face here than anywhere else and they do have some decent songs to back them up. There are some bad and uninspired riffs (I'm currently listening to 'Now You've Got Something to Die For' and the first good riff is 2 minutes in) which don't help things very much, since I'm not a big fan of breakdowns or plain, \"listen to the heaviness\" riffs, but the sound helps those poor moments more than on any other LoG album and lets every band member shine through.\n\nHowever, there are a fair number of riffs on the album and some of them are pretty good. My tolerance for chug and fill riffs is high and LoG really do excel at this sort of thing, with at least one decent example in each song. The guitarists palm-mute a lot, so they sound quite groovy, yet the fluidity of the fills (tone aside) is reminiscent of a more interesting classic/modern synthesis that should appeal to many different metalheads. There aren't many straight-ahead lead moments on 'Ashes of the Wake', with just a few songs containing solos, including the largely instrumental title track which includes Chris Poland's (ex-Megadeth) contribution. The leads are played well and with some technical skill: I like them a lot, though that might be due to their rarity and the relief they bring from what is otherwise a barrage of slightly samey riffs. The atmospheric leads on 'The Faded Line' are actually the most unusual thing here, especially the flattened tone of that weird melody that crops up. It sounds almost like a wind instrument (I'm thinking didgeridoo) or a drone aircraft or very persistent flatulence - whatever it is, it's a little creepy and cool, although that part never comes to much.\n\nI spent so long talking about the guitarists because they do dominate the album, regardless of Chris Adler's presence on drums. He is, and has been recognised as, a very skilled drummer, yet he doesn't make such a big impact on 'Ashes of the Wake' because the rhythms are actually laid down by the guitars and he can't alter those repetitive patterns with too much of his own creativity. I mean, his fills and beats and general assault are great, but he just doesn't have the flexibility to stand out for long - LoG don't provide those kind of opportunities. The bass also isn't allowed many of its own manoeuvres, since it takes a lot of effort just to keep the guitars in check; however, John Campbell isn't as pointless a presence as he would later become. I leave Randy Blythe for last because I don't know about him. He's got a fairly brutal voice that always sounds somewhat overdriven and in fact does the album both a big favour and a minor disservice by singing with the rhythms and not grabbing all the attention. On that first head, his style is too uniform to warrant being at the forefront of the songs, especially since he has a lot of lyrics for each song; on the second point, because he doesn't create any new patterns, and certainly no new melodies, the music can become rather plain at times if the riffs fail to deliver.\n\nThe songs don't leave a lot to choose between them, except for the title track, which is more lead-oriented and unfocused than the others, and 'Now You've Got Something to Die For', which is shitter than the others. I'm a fan of those curious moments on 'The Faded Line' and the dynamics of 'Break You', while the two opening tracks are also worth your time. Perhaps 'Omerta' is too sluggish and chuggy, with a lot of time spent on breakdowns, plus the closer disappoints on the riff front, despite some nice clean moments.\n\nLamb of God have never done anything hugely revolutionary for metal, though 'Ashes of the Wake' (and arguably the preceding 'As the Palaces Burn') are two solid groove metal albums that pack in the riffs and maintain a high intensity without pandering overtly to the mainstream. Maybe this isn't the most exciting or interesting album to listen to, but it is very satisfying and deserves repeated listens. Sometimes, you know, I'm just hungry for meat and potatoes.\n",
        "\nDo you like how heavy and hard Pantera is? Do you like catchy simple guitar work? Do ideas like substance and technicality seem absurd to you? Are you just looking for something heavy? If the answer to all these questions is yes, then boy you might just enjoy this from front to back, but for those of us with expectations this falls short in MANY ways.\n\nIt shares a few of the same issues I generally have, repetition and lack of substance. Its like a Pantera album, they most likely ran out of ideas about halfway through and relied heavily on metal cliches. At least with Pantera though you could tell Dimebag was passionate in his solos and Phil sounded like he wanted to be in that studio. There is absolutely no inspiration in Lamb of God's sound and it sounds like they only had one idea and tried to make a musical blueprint out of it. There is no energy, you can almost hear how bored and emotionally disconnected they all are from it and every track sounds like a big loop. Some guys got together and decided they wanted to make some money making music but they didn't put any emotion, feeling or energy into it and they decided they had better things to do than write songs. You could listen to any generic half groove half metalcore band and get better then this, Hatebreed, Throwdown, take your pick.\n\nRandy Blythe is a terrible vocalist, imagine Phil Anselmo's screams mixed with metalcore pseudo growls and you have an exact recreation of what he's trying to do and it just sounds god awful. Now mix that with the fact that he's so drunk that he's usually noodling around hoping to stumble across the correct key by pure chance. As if that wasn't lousy enough there is no way I could have understood a single word coming out of his mouth, when matching it with a lyric booklet it still doesn't add up. Not that the lyrics matter, its generic 'fight the power, authority=bad' kind of stuff, you've heard it before and you've heard it in much better words from much better vocalists.\n\nBesides absolute tedium that is as bad as performances get, everything else; bass, guitars and drums, are set on grooving, the bass didn't stand out and was probably mixed out. The drums were mostly mid tempo and simple basic rock beats occasionally speeding up to sound 'br00tal'. One guitar played grooves, the kind of stuff Dimebag would come up with in 3 seconds and throw away because he felt they were insipid or the guys from Meshuggah would scrap because it wasn't bhao whao whao whao enough for them. The other guitar sticks to one note chugging. Chugga chugga chugga... if you are expecting a choo choo you'll never get one. Occasionally they try to throw together three notes to sound like a melody but if becomes blatantly clear they give up before the melody even comes forth. Add some generic breakdowns and you have the gist of every track.\n\nThe worst part though is that even in comparison to lower grade groove metal it still falls short. The guitar work is not catchy at all, hell its not even slightly memorable. By the time your done the whole thing will have felt like a wall of chugging and trying to remember a single riff that stood out will prove challenging. It literally cannot even fill the most basic goals and expectations of the genre. \n\nIt could have one redeeming factor though, which is pure force and heaviness. Keyword is could though because whoever mastered the production decided to strip it of any rawness and power. Good job, you took what would have already been a divisive and controversial metal release and made it into something that even the most simple minded metalheads who drool at the mere idea of a heavy groove will poke at with a stick before listening (I really don't mean to bag on the fan base at all).\n",
        "\nLamb of God are one of those bands that get lapped up by a lot of regular folk, but are mostly loathed by the purists. Why, though, is anyone's guess. Their popularity makes them prime targets for hatred and negativity, while their musical style is largely inoffensive. They aren't quite metalcore enough to warrant abuse on that front, because the breakdowns are not disgustingly overused and the vocals aren't screamy/whiny, though not exactly perfect. Really, the appropriate response is probably a casually amiable shrug - \"they're fine, I guess\".\n\nAnd that's LoG's strength, but it's also a downfall. They never make me really excited, but they never especially let me down. That's why your Regular Joe likes them, because for him, they're really heavy; your seasoned metalhead, on the other hand, sees the workmanlike attitude of the band and is surprised by neither heaviness or originality. That said, Sacrament was a big step for a band who had wallowed in shit (debut album) and made technically challenging but rather unsatisfactory albums (As the Palaces Burn and Ashes of the Wake). The general elements that the band are using here is not vastly different, but the effect aimed for has shifted a good few degrees.\n\nRandy Blythe is singing much more clearly (his diction made his vocals insufferable early in the band's career) and less overtly about Afghanistan and Iraq, which is a fucking relief, plus the vocal hooks are much more pronounced without losing the heaviness from the delivery. One-line hooks like the title of 'Walk With Me in Hell' or the closing rally cry on 'Blacken the Cursed Son' give individual songs definition, while the guitarists have also created more memorable riffs: the attention-grabbing 'Redneck', the bounding groove that kicks off 'Requiem', or the (actually rather poor) motif of 'Descending', which - if you hadn't guessed - is a descending riff. The tone doesn't quite go for that \"we must make everything sound heavy even though it isn't really\" vibe that a lot of popular modern bands have gone with: it's actually much smoother, which makes the chug-and-fill formula palatable, while the more adventurous riffs stick out as parts of a song instead of pit fodder. Solos are less frequent than I would like, although the few opportunities aren't squandered. I know, I know that Chris Adler on drums is busy and skilled, though his approach of loading fills and frequently changing parts doesn't really complement the catchier direction the band were pursuing here. Fuck knows what happened to the bass - I certainly haven't been listening to it.\n\nSacrament partly achieves the goal of being memorable and helping the band cross over to the mainstream, but it certainly doesn't do so with flying colours. 'Walk With Me in Hell' and 'Redneck' stand out for their unwavering vision and do represent the most immediately appealing material here. 'Redneck' is reminiscent of Pantera's 'I'm Broken', which is naturally a problem for some metalheads who do not approve of the groovy meathead direction, but I'm not really fussed. 'Foot to the Throat' and 'Pathetic' get the blood flowing a little faster and are generally heavier than the other songs; again, they don't truly explode and the album ends up feeling short of gas. The band don't play fast very often, they don't sound mean enough when they play slow, and they don't nail the hooks with enough regularity to make Sacrament a truly fun romp. It's not bad, it's just not great.\n",
        "\nLamb of God is always a band that I've thought of as fairly solid, even if I did find a lot of their work pretty samey. So I was really surprised to see that this single was rated as an average of 11% after 8 reviews. I mean, that's a really, really harsh score guys, isn't it? In thinking this I did fear that I'd made the same mistake as I did with Waking the Cadaver, but in all honesty this is a masterpiece in comparison to that band.\n\nNow, first things first: just because I said it was a masterpiece compared to that piece of shit doesn't mean that it's great. Because really, it's not. And I'm not saying that because it isn't the genre of music I'd expect from LoG (although that is also true), it generally isn't a song that has much to it. It's deathcore, but deathcore done far, far worse than it could be. I don't know why they decided to add some of that to their groove metal style of music, but they did and it's not going anywhere. It can't be forgotten or anything, it's too late for that.\n\nAnyway, to business: as I said, it's deathcore. Not too much else to say about that one. A weird \"Weeeee\" noise to begin with, and then the blast beats come pounding in and the guitars are just completely drowned out. Even the vocals aren't what I'd expect of the band. I don't know why, because normally Randy is pretty solid when it comes to growling, but they don't really sound right here. I don't really care too much for lyrics, but if I did I might take some more marks off. They're a bit lame to say the least. And as for the bass (when you hear it for about ten seconds when nothing else is making any noise), well, it seems to be played by someone who only has one hand. It's incredibly slow and sounds as if every note is spread ridiculously far apart. Thank god it can't be heard elsewhere.\n\nThe best part of the song is without a doubt the bit with the breakdowns. That's never a good sign. But hey, they're bearable. Most of the rest of it is just a random mesh of noise that doesn't have any real value. Oh dear god, I can suddenly understand all the poor ratings. Really, I should stop thinking that everyone on the archives doesn't know what they're on about. 0%? No. But certainly nowhere near being half decent either.\n\nOkay, in future I'm going to try not to let my curiosity get the better of me. I don't know what to make of this, but it seems like it's the worst song on the album. I listened to a few others (although I don't care enough to write an entire review on it) and they all far outclass this track. Good thing too, because otherwise this band might well have gone completely over the edge in terms of good bands turned bad. Monotonous chugs and breakdowns with blast beats in-between are definitely not Lamb of God's style, and I really, sincerely hope that these reviews are a lesson for them. Honestly, go back to making groove metal that at least has some good things about it.\n",
        "\nAfter the somewhat experimental, uneven Sacrament and phoned-in blandness of Wrath, Lamb of God return with a vengeance on Resolution. Listening to this is like erasing the past 8 years and picking up right where the excellent Ashes of the Wake left off. \n\nFrom the first dirty, southern guitar chords to the Randy\u2019s shriek, I am back in high school again. The production is crystal clear, but not washed out. \u201cWalk with Me in Hell,\u201d though a great song, sounded like it was recorded in a tin can, and Wrath in general was so compressed it felt like a SNES soundtrack. This is a return to the riff machine that made these guys top dogs to begin with. The guitar-work is fast, tight, and just plain fun. If you were one of the people who went racing for tabs after hearing \u201cLaid to Rest\u201d the first time, this is the album for you. There are too many moments to name, but the intro transition on \u201cGhost Walking,\u201d and the relentless \"Terminally Unique\" stick out in my mind at the moment.\n\nBack on Randy: he hasn\u2019t sounded this monstrous in a long time. He had virtually discarded the remnants of his death metal roots on \u201cSacrament,\u201d but here they return to a point. He still has that Anselmo-esque inflection he added, but the high pitched shrieks and crunching lows are back to add variety and hopefully scare away some of the core kids. The lyrics, if a bit contrived, get me going. I think the best example of the guitars, vocal delivery, and lyrics combining to just make you murderous is \u201cVisitation.\u201d \u201cMy blood is boiling! I can't feel my own skin!\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s go time.\n\nAs far as innovation goes, there are a few successful experiments here that still manage to fit nicely into the overall aesthetic. \u201cInsurrection\u201d has some clean singing on it that holds up okay. It\u2019s nothing special, but the track itself turns out to be quite good. \u201cBarbarosa\u201d is a cool, very sad, Southern-sounding instrumental. Most notably, \"King Me\" incorporates strings. I was skeptical about how this would fit, but it manages to make this a truly epic closer to the album. The best way I can describe it is to take the riff from \u201cWalk with Me in Hell,\u201d slow it down, build the volume and intensity in the drums and vocals, turn it into another thrash-fest, then break just a moment before returning to the main hook, but this time on a full string arrangement. There are also some choir vocals to add to the ambience. Some may hate on this track, I think it\u2019s spectacular.\n\nI have only one minor gripe with this album. \u201cInvictus\u201d and \u201cCheated\u201d don\u2019t hold up quite as well as the other tracks. I didn\u2019t find myself wanting to hit skip, but they felt more like outtakes to me. With this album being their longest (14 tracks at just under an hour), I feel cutting these two might have brought the length down to something a bit more open to regular repeat listening. That being said, I never found myself feeling bored over the course of play.\n\nThat pretty much does it. There are very few bands that rose up during my younger days that I would still recommend new albums for, but this one succeeds. With Randy writing the next album from prison, I am interested to see how it turns out.\n",
        "\nLamb of God is a band that I find you can't help but like some of their work, but there always seems to be something to dislike about them. 'Ashes of the Wake' is a prime example of this, an album that features several likable qualities yet fails to deliver anything spectacular.\n\n'Laid to Rest' is easily the best song on the album, featuring some really neat hooks from Mark and Willie and epic drumming from Chris. Randy's vocals are - as ever - awesome too, and the whole song just gives that great feeling of being the perfect blend of heavy and melodic. I don't know how anyone can dislike this song, it's simply too good for anyone to think otherwise.\n\nUnfortunately though, not every song is as good as 'Laid to Rest'. And when most of the songs sound pretty similar to each other, that's not a good thing at all. Listening through the album, every song seems to start in the same way, and the only songs that don't sound like they're just ripping off the other works are 'Laid to Rest', 'Remorse Is for the Dead' and the title track. The worst bit about that is that even they do sound a little similar to the others in places.\n\nPretty much the further you listen through the record, the more you realise that every song either features similar drumming or similar guitar riffs. This is no clearer than when you hear 'Faded Line' and 'Hourglass' next to each other, the former sounding just like the former but taken up a tempo on the guitars. If the drums weren't different, I'd swear it were the same song. Aside from this, the riffs do seem to be recycled across the album and the drumming (although fantastic) does seem quite similar in places and you can swear that you've heard it before.\n\nThe title track is one that deviates from this, almost entirely consisting of an epic guitar duel. The drums that play in the background are as good as they are throughout, but because it's an instrumental Randy's voice is missing from the action. Unfortunately that means that it's not as good as 'Laid to Rest', simply because it isn't LoG without Randy. Other than that it's good, but it's missing an important part of the puzzle out.\n\nSo overall, there are some likable songs on this album, but for the most part it just sounds a bit too repetitive and samey to be considered a great groove metal album. It's nowhere near the quality of Chimaira's 'The Impossibility of Reason', despite the tracks on that album having obvious similarities to each other as well, and that's really a bit disappointing. I might consider listening to some of their other stuff, but I think I'll turn to Chimaira first if I want quality groove metal.\n",
        "\nI have a philosophy that might strike some as being petty, but it's something I rigidly adhere to: whoever owns the keys to the car or the keys to the house has veto power of the music. Such a philosophy lead me to be listening to Lamb of God's supposedly most \"death metal\" album whilst sitting in the passenger's seat of a friend of mine. However, I attempted to like it. That's kind of the second part of that philosophy: whoever is in the passenger's seat or a guest will try to enjoy whatever is being played. So I tried my best to enjoy New American Gospel, preparing myself for brutal breakdowns, vicious drums, cutting guitars, and barked vocals. \n\nI didn't get what I had hoped for, and then some; I have not, in a long while, heard a more monotonous affair than New American Gospel. I don't know if the rest of Lamb of God's material is equally bland, but let me describe what this album has in store for the potential listener. I found drums that seemed to vary from mid-paced idling on the double bass with that ever so cliche' tuned-ever-so-high snare drum occasionally joining in, to slow narcolepsy-inducing breakdown section, with nothing that pushes the engine even past 3000 rpm. The guitars try their hardest, though, to deliver a fit of aggression deserving of the half angsty/half tuff guy lyrics, but by golly they seem to just get mired in this morass of chugging and tritones, delivering one soulless and meandering riff after another. They try, sweating and plunking away at the strings, oh these guitarists try, but the riffs never seem to rise above the level of mildly perturbed, much less pissed off or raging. I mean, even considering that this is half groove metal/half metalcore with a tinge of grindcore influence, and adjusting my expectations accordingly, it still can't help but seem like these folks are acting like a third-tier band at best. These riffs literally annoy and frustrate me with their level of retardation and tedium, and even if it's just the sluggishness of the drums rubbing off, it still makes listening to this album hard.\n\nDon't rely on Blythe's vocals to redeem this mess, because he delivers probably the most monotonous, droll, and useless performance here out of all the members, \"rawr rawr rawr\"-ing (I mean that in the worst way possible) his way through the songs without changing up his rhythm or pitch, because no, that would mean deviating from this tough guy act he has going. I mean I guess it fits in with the whole \"let's be super repetitive\" thing this band has going, but god his voice gets annoying after a couple minutes. It's like Blythe feels he has discovered the perfect vocal rhythm and delivery style, just as the guitarists feel they have discovered the perfect riff, and is committed to writing only variations and permutations on that one rhythm or that one riff. Same goes for the drums, except he uses 3 basic types of beats, which is better, I guess, than Blythe, who uses only one style. Either way, there are hardly enough ideas on this album for an EP, let alone a full length album. Leave this album to the newbs and 14 year olds who think they're super badass, seeing as there is so much better out there, even in the creativity-starved world of -core.\n",
        "\nLamb of God have the distinction of arguably being the first indisputably metal band that the seasoned metalhead will feel comfortable with habitually disliking. As one becomes familiarized with the more extreme edges of metal, they almost invariably become jaded to its more mainstream, somewhat \"watered-down\" forms, and a lot of times this means dissociating from the sorts of Pantera-esque groove metal bands who introduced them to the craft in the first place. Lamb of God are the perfect poster child for demonizing this particular breed of heathen metal: they lack the back catalog in a totally different genre that contrarians can cling to like they do with Pantera, nor are they the groovified evolution of a famous band that started as pure thrash. They play dumb music for brain-dead morons, some of whom include - *gasp* - people who have no interest in metal music aside from Lamb of God. Clearly we are dealing with a band who are downright harmful to the integrity of high art as a legitimate form of expression. Then again, as long as the band keep making music like this, I wholly support that endeavor.\n\nTo get something out of the way early on: I am not a huge Lamb of God fan in general, despite the fact that it's partially due to their influence on my music tastes that I'm presently listening to metal and writing any reviews on this website at all. I've been into metal for something like four or five years now and I've subsequently done a lot of spring cleaning for my pet nostalgic bands. To date, I haven't heard LOG's first two albums, but Ashes of the Wake has most certainly not aged gracefully, and while Sacrament hasn't undergone reexamination yet, I'm skeptical of its ability to pass as well based on what I remember of it. All of this is irrelevant, though, as Wrath was my favorite of the trio even back then and even if I grew out of this album the day after tomorrow, I don't think I'd be able to deny its strength, especially in light of the norms in the genre around it.\n\nWhat Demolition Hammer represents to thrash metal, Wrath represents to groove metal. I don't mean to suggest that the two sound even remotely similar to one another, but I think both represent a sort of ideal in their respective genres: nonstop, unmitigated, punishing pummeling. What distinguishes this cleanly and definitively from the other two Lamb of God albums I'm familiar with is the sheer intensity on display. Ashes of the Wake functions as if Lamb of God were on cruise control, going through the motions and making sure each album met a predefined breakdown quota and each riff was in the designated key; I don't remember Sacrament faring much better. Wrath, on the other hand, is ridiculously unhinged for the genre: anything even vaguely resembling angst is apportioned to the bookends of the tracklist, and all nine songs in between are just unfiltered, legitimately-conveyed rage. It's almost like its two predecessors are simply dummy albums, displaying the vague framework the band will use for the real deal once it comes time to make it; and that real deal is this album.\n\nThe guitar tone on this album is absolutely huge, and the band make the best use of it by making sure the breakdowns this time around are downright lethal. Wrath-era Lamb of God have effectively kept the breakdowns from sounding like meandering, pointless slow sections, which was a really big problem on Ashes of the Wake. Here, the band only use them after they've earned them through a section of speed that seems almost blistering in comparison, which makes the band's process of stripping away the drums and slowing the riff down surprisingly lethal. Essentially, they have become about as heavy as breakdowns possibly can in this genre without becoming a different beast entirely. There are still a couple that aren't exactly great, which I imagine is something this band are damned to do eternally, but on the other hand you get devastating moments like the outro of \"Fake Messiah\" or the sheer bludgeoning single-note chug assaults used multiple times throughout the length of \"Broken Hands\". Minimal pseudo-southern twangs that sound like caricatures of country licks, and minimal breakdowns that sound content to just plod around and say \"HURR I AM BREKDOWN\". Nothing that'll remind you that you're listening to something that's generally thought of as Metal Lite. Just massive, heavy grooves.\n\nI think a large chunk of this album's qualitative success can be attributed to the comparatively large amount of influences from death metal and thrash metal. Of course, this doesn't sound like groove metal plus Deceased or anything, but the relatively high amount of speed involved in most of the songs brings thrash metal more readily to mind than your average groove metal band, and most of the groovy riffs are brutal enough for one to say that they have \"death metal influences\" without raising any eyebrows. The band's flirtation with these elements pays off, and immediately so. The faster sections in songs like \"Contractor\" and \"Everything to Nothing\" don't whiz past you, they just blow you over and proceed to initiate a stampede on your body right there; when they slow things to breakdown tempos, there isn't any momentum at all lost in transitioning - the same unmistakable energy drives both, and neither has the obvious advantage. This isn't an extreme metal album, but there are plenty of thrash metal/death metal albums that don't come even close to Wrath in terms of intensity. Mind you, you've still got the goofy \"atmospheric\" leads that pop up over the songs from time to time, but I actually don't really feel like they're a detriment to the band's overall goals here. They fit pretty seamlessly on top of the band's more mid-paced groove metal riffs, and simply give the next breakdown or thrash/groove hybrid riff that much more power.\n\nMy memory might be betraying me here, but I think Lamb of God's vocals here are more intense than they've ever been on the other albums I'm familiar with. Randy Blythe's shrieks sound less dry and more vicious, but the real star of the vocal show here is his lower-register performance. His growls aren't exactly objectively great as far as vocals go or anything (they're rather noticeably strained at times), but they compensate by being as charismatic and emotional as possible. Vocals on past Lamb of God albums (or at least the ones I've heard) generally consist of dry, underwhelming pseudo-growling, but Wrath is decidedly a turn for the better. It's almost as if he was shown the instrumental performance, from its thick and pummeling guitars to its absolutely massive and crushing drum beats, and then dared to create something of equal value. It's something along the lines of an extremely drunk redneck trying to yell at you, which probably sounds awful in writing but works surprisingly well in execution. Actually, I think that might be the best way to sum up the album in general: \"sounds awful in writing but works surprisingly well in execution\".\n\nIf you've disowned Lamb of God based on a handful of songs, whether you will like Wrath or not hinges entirely on what exactly you dislike about them. Hate the concept of groove metal in general? Does the concept of stompy breakdowns and downtuned, slightly slower thrash metal make you want to gag? Okay, fair enough, this isn't your thing. But if you've ever felt like Lamb of God had the potential to be good deep down and merely hampered themselves with various flaws, then you need to give this a shot. This is just about every good idea the band have ever had with nearly all the undesirable aspects excised; in other words, it's the entire band's performance brought extremely close to its maximum potential. Why this seems to be the most maligned Lamb of God album is a total mystery to me - to me, this is an obvious refinement, an improvement in every regard, and one of maybe three albums groove metal can use to justify its existence as a genre. I really, really like this.\n",
        "\nFor those in the metal scene that are unaware as to Lamb Of God's existence, they really are not missing anything great. Aside from a few great tracks, their pre-Sacrament material was monotonous and boring, drilling the same riffs into your head a thousand times until one gets so sick of them they vow never to listen again. Ashes Of The Wake is the only album they have put out before Sacrament that one could find real merit in, and even that was dragged down by filler songs such as Omerta that chugged along and bored the life out of the listener. Sacrament was the 2006 installment in their discography and, whilst still being monotonous and boring, it is somehow a cut above the albums released prior to this and is a more than listenable release.\n\nThe guilty party is comprised of guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler on guitar, Chris Adler behind the drum kit, Randy Blythe screaming his lungs out and John Campbell on the completely inaudible bass guitar. The album was released to great praise and remains one of the highest selling bands the album has put out to date. Lamb Of God have often been compared to Pantera for their groove metal style and whilst such comparisons wouldn't be entirely unfounded, Sacrament remains one of their least groove-oriented albums. Instead this is more of a thrash album with pounding drums, fast paced guitar riffs and Randy Blythe screeching like the world was about to end around him. The lyrical topics on this album focus on hypocrisy in personality, the government and other political issues and various homages to the apocalypse.\n\nThe musicianship on this album is of a very high standard with various fast-paced riffs that fly past and hit you so hard you barely have time to get your breath back. However many of the songs are absolutely indistinguishable from each other as the band clearly focused on playing fast without creating too many memorable moments. The intro to Walk With Me In Hell has a sound akin to that of the world ending around the listener, and it very much fits the lyrical content and serves to build a solid atmosphere for the song. Grammy award nominated single Redneck also stands out as being very catchy and the riffs, whilst chugging along as is expected of Lamb Of God, still manage to stick in your head. Redneck also has a highly enjoyable chorus that one will be screaming along to. However, this song is also guilty of having some of the worst lyricism out there, with lines such as \"This is a mother fuckin' invitation\" that really detract from the song itself. The band are clearly talented and this only take away from the sound.\n\nThe most talented member of the band is drummer Chris Adler, who lays down some varied and exciting drum beats that are consistently great and highly varied. He is often singled out as the best member of the band and his performance on here is flawless, with some fast double bass sections but also some great use of cymbals on songs such as Redneck and Requiem. Aside from the drumming however, Requiem is a boring song that fails to do anything new and feels like the band was just going through the motions to create a song that just chugs along and gets the listener from A to B. The lyrics on here are also highly immature with frequent usage of the F-word which is completely unnecessary in the context of the song. Swearing in music is not so much a problem when done tastefully but Randy Blythe is guilty of using it at the wrong times. Also another complaint that can be made about the lyrics is the lack of relevancy to them-many of the songs have political statements directed at George Bush, and therefore this was more an album of its time instead of now.\n\nThe songs themselves are mainly fast paced thrashers with Randy Blythe unfortunately not carrying them forward very well with his frequently samey vocal patterns and unusually small range. His performances on Ashes Of The Wake and later on Wrath and Resolution showed off that he has a decent enough range for a screamed vocalist so on here his two tones really do get annoying, and his Phil Anselmo tough-guy shouting is a cause for alarm. Without him they may be a little more tolerable but unfortunately, Randy only drags this album down. None of the songs are particularly TERRIBLE but many feel as though the band is just re-hashing things they have already done five times on this release already. For the best songs, check out Walk With Me In Hell, Redneck and Descending (which boasts some fantastic drumming and riffs that are actually more than memorable whilst being crushingly heavy). Stay away from songs like Pathetic and Requiem however as they are nothing more than chug-fests that your time is better served elsewhere. This is a solid enough album that just has too many flaws to be anything more than a great release that is listenable enough but only in small doses.\n",
        "\nDuring the nearly 3 year gap between Lamb Of God\u2019s sloppy and poorly conceived debut and \u201cAs The Palaces Burn\u201d is arguably where the band truly found their identity. But the question becomes, what exactly changed between 2000 and 2003 that would account for a dramatic shift in any modern metal band hailing for the U.S.? The answer is the popularized fusion of American hardcore with Gothenburg melodeath ala At The Gates and In Flames. To be fair, this band didn\u2019t quite go out on a melodeath plagiarizing scheme with only a subtle helping of old fashioned American tough guy posturing, but rather utilized the melodic contour of the Swedish sound to temper what would otherwise be little more than 2nd rate Pantera worship with an occasional rhythmic gimmick or NYDM inspired chaotic section.\n\nIn some respects, this is still largely the same band that butchered a hybrid of tried and true styles a few years prior. The guitar sound is still as meaty as a fully stocked slaughter house, the drums are still cymbal heavy and possessed of a gimpy, shallow sounding snare hit, and vocalist Randy Blythe is still hell bent on puking his vocal chords onto the microphone with every single syllable. But the riff work has taken on a much more technical character, throwing in those signature tremolo harmony bursts that were littered all over \u201cSlaughter Of The Soul\u201d, alongside some more conventional melodic ideas during the slower sections reminiscent of \u201cThe Jester Race\u201d. Granted, this is only a single device employed over a template of rhythmic slams and stomps that is different from the early 90s Gothenburg sound, but a few spots on \u201cRuin\u201d and \u201cAs The Palaces Burn\u201d definitely make no secret of those influences, and \u201cFor Your Malice\u201d all but sounds like it was lifted right off of In Flames\u2019 \u201cColony\u201d at its inception.\n\nWhile the formula at play here serves this band much better than their previous one, as a whole this album comes off as a little monotonous, as if they found a new toy and are determined to literally play the thing to death. There are a few really bright spots such as \u201cPurified\u201d which features some impressive riff work reminiscent of Slayer mixed with a bit of Suffocation, and although it starts off sounding like a painfully stagnant nod to the plodding grooves of Meshuggah, \u201cBoot Scraper\u201d mixes things up pretty well and avoids sounding too much like an outright nod to either Pantera or At The Gates. But for the most part this album goes to the same well hoping to draw a slightly different bucket of water, and it never quite materializes into much else than a mechanical rehash of something that was much more organic and impassioned circa 1995, though the band manages to keep things tight and together while exploring some technical ideas.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why this album is highly regarded by fans of 2000s metalcore, as it embodies a lot of the clich\u00e9 musical elements without being overly obvious of its Gothenburg elements and whiny in its vocal approach (\u201ccough\u201d Trivium). Most who are really into the work of God Forbid or Nevermore will definitely find a winner here, though it embodies most of what I personally consider the less than stellar but all too common trappings of modern American metal. For those drawn to the purer version of melodeath from the Scandinavian region, this is a bit too watered down for such tastes and should probably be either avoided or approached at the bargain bin.\n",
        "\nLamb Of God tends to be a popular subject of discussion amongst younger fans of metal, or at least that has been my experience. Constant references to them as being drawn from a death metal sound, particularly with regards to their earliest material kept coming up, thus prompting both a sense of skepticism and curiosity in me for what was actually going on with this band back in 2000. Upon learning that the band used to go by the name Burn The Priest (a more appropriate title for the alleged sub-genre affiliation), and also finding out that there was some grindcore influences going on in their 90s material, it became clear where the death metal comparisons were coming from.\n\nMany laud this band\u2019s debut \u201cNew American Gospel\u201d as being their most intense, but many more seem to disown it as a botched first attempt, and in a sense both parties have the right idea. This is an album that is defined literally by how heavy it tries to be, pulling out a veritable arsenal of Pantera, early Machine Head, Meshuggah and trace amounts of NYDM influences here and there, mostly in the instrumental department. The riff work gets a bit busy in a thrashing, chaotic fashion on parts of \u201cLetter To The Unborn\u201d that is mildly reminiscent of Malevolent Creation, while the closing long song \u201cO.D.H.G.A.B.F.E.\u201d throws in a bluesy sounding Black Sabbath-styled riff with a strong dose of Southern attitude ala Pantera. However, most of what is heard on here guitar-wise tends to stagnate in moderately intricate chug groove territory, getting monotonous after the first couple songs, and relies heavily on the drums (which are pretty dry and flat sounding) to keep things interesting.\n\nWhile mostly a straight-forward groove album with a few extreme twists here and there, this thing really crashes and burns in the vocal department. Its common knowledge that vocalist Randy Blythe was hitting the bottle to the point of feeling no pain during the recording sessions for this album, and boy does he showcase what happens when someone can\u2019t hold their liquor. Right from the beginning of \u201cBlack Label\u201d (named for Blythe\u2019s favorite brand of daddy\u2019s cough medicine) the random barks and shrieks that are largely remnants from the death/grind aspects of Burning The Priest\u201d are amounting to little more than unintelligible gibberish. Normally this wouldn\u2019t be an issue for a grind-infused offering, but the rhythmic precision that should always come with a non-discernible series of gurgles and shouts is not to be found here, rendering an otherwise fairly tight musical arrangement into a garbled mess.\n\nPerhaps the biggest mistake I made in approaching this band was going to the very beginning, and most who are generally drawn towards the modern, metalcore-like character of this band\u2019s later offerings should steer clear of this album, along with anyone who might be receptive to the band\u2019s more extreme past prior to taking the LOG moniker. In spite of all the clich\u00e9 Pantera trappings lifted right off \u201cFar Beyond Driven\u201d and occasional references to the goofy atmospherics of \u201cBurn My Eyes\u201d, this is a style that can be pulled off reasonably well. But it definitely didn\u2019t happen here.\n",
        "\nNow here is one to get the fists of wannabe gangsters and trying-to-hard tough guys pumping everywhere. Devoid of anything vaguely resembling value, this is a complete waste of time - I actually feel dumber after listening to it. From the irritating \"look how tough I am\" vocals to the inane lyrics and lifeless riffs, be sure a garbage can is in close proximity. Meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator, there is zero integrity to be found here. And seriously, does anyone actually expect a song that uses the word \"guaran-fucking-teed\" over five times to actually be good?\n\nThe stagnant ever-present palm-muted chugging and recycled metalcore riffs provides a musical backdrop that has neither any real energy or anything interesting. I call it a backdrop because the main attraction is obviously supposed to be the vocals. The vocals are harsh, but every word is easy to make out. It is blatantly obvious the vocalist is trying his absolute hardest to sound like a tough guy. Am I buying it? Not a chance. Not even the drums are doing anything remotely interesting here.\n\nIt gets worse. These are some of, if not the most, weak and shamelessly gimmicky lyrics I have ever heard. Although I somewhat agree with the political message, these are the worst. They are fIlled with vapid attempts at one-liners, stupid analogies and metaphors, as well as the mandatory testosterone driven attempts at appearing tough. Instead of rambling on about how god-awful these lyrics are, I'll let them speak for themselves:\n\n\"Yeah motherfucker, let's take a ride\nWe're rolling route Irish, someone has got to die\nTrick or treat, it's IEDs\nSo roll the dice as we leave\nCause it's 8 miles of pure luck\nWith more bang for Sam's buck\nGuaran-fucking-teed, someone will bleed\nGuaran-fucking-teed, someone will bleed\"\n\nAlthough I feel most of their songs are filler, I'm not denying that Lamb of God do have some pretty good songs. This, however, is miles below filler. This is pure garbage, with no redeeming qualities. The guitar playing is rehashed chug-laden metalcore, the drummer is doing nothing special, and the vocalist really needs to shut up. This is probably just an attempt to cash in, and quite possibly an attempt to bring their political message to a larger audience by dumbing down their music for the average mallcore teenager. Whatever, there is no excuse for this trash. Next.\n\nOriginally Posted at:\nhttp://ifthisishellthenimlucky.blogspot.ca/\n",
        "\nAfter 'Ashes of the Wake' people started having huge expectations of the Virginian post-thrash metal band. Along with Machine Head and some others they were considered the saviors of the metal scene. Lamb of God probably took the chance to surprise the people who were waiting for an \"Ashes of the Wake pt. 2\", and released a rather over-produced album instead. Not that I have anything against massive studio albums, but I do have something against a raw metal band like Lamb of God trying to sound like fucking Epica. Yet, this album has really fucking great moments. The riffs and songwriting overall make up for a lot of the wannabe 'epic metal' stuff they pulled off.\n\n\nAs the album kicks off we directly hear choirs chanting along with 'Walk With Me in Hell' and guitars and a snare drum reverbing as if they were recorded in the St. Peter's church. Randy Blythe breathes in and out closely to his mic with a shitload of reverb and delay processing his voice into a weird demonic echoing sound. What the fuck is going on here?! This isn't the same band that smashed you right in the face with the first riff of the album! ('Ruin' on 'As the Palaces Burn' and 'Laid to Rest' on 'Ashes of the Wake') That's what I wanted to hear! Well, the tone was set. It was quite a shock to hear them doing this kind of stuff.\n\n\nLater on I started to find out that the album actually also has it's great moments. Mid-paced headbang-track 'Descending' is one of those moments. Randy Blythe sings about his alcohol addiction and puts it into words like a true poet (\"This God that I worship, this demon I hate, conspired as one, it's exactly the same). Overall I wasn't disappointed by his lyrics. Eventually I also grew into the other tracks. 'Redneck' pretty much became a classic of course. It just annoyed me to hear how polished their sound had become. The real hardcore Lamb of God fans will probably be able to forgive the band that they released an overproduced album and some retards will actually praise it of course. \n\n\nBut fact is that Lamb of God shows once again that they have created their own signature style. Their riffs and vocals sound pretty different than other bands these days which is a thing I absolutely admire about them. It's good to know that there are still bands out there with an unique sound (a lot of those deathcore bands lately all sound the same in my opinion). Music-wise I'd recommend this album to any Lamb of God fan, but get ready for a seriously unfitting production. Oh, and if you don't believe me about the choir stuff, just get the producer edition of Sacrament and check out the 'FX' track of 'Walk With Me in Hell'.\n\n\nHighlights:\n- Pathetic\n- Redneck\n- Descending\n",
        "\nLamb of God is back with a new studio album after a huge tour in support of their previous album \u201cWrath\u201d. Whereas the previous album was rather rough sounding with some thrashy edges, this new album sees Lamb of God returning to the sound that made them well known in the first place. On this new release you'll find tracks that will surely remind you of \u201cAs The Palaces Burn\u201d, \u201cAshes of the Wake\u201d, and \u201cSacrament\u201d. Nevertheless, 2012's \u201cResolution\u201d also sees the Richmond-based metal formation explore new territories of heavy music.\n\nLet's start of with the experimental edge of Resolution. Probably one of the best examples of Lamb of God's experimentation is unleashed upon us as soon as we start listening to this cd. The first track starts off with frontman Randy Blythe taking a deep breath and unleashing his roaring voice over an extremely filthy, slow sludge riff, which is something we are not very used to from Lamb of God. Of course, they've had slow-paced songs in the past (such as 2003's \u201cVigil\u201d and 2004's \u201cOmerta\u201d), but none of these tracks were as sludge-like as album opener \u201cStraight for the Sun\u201d, which is almost good enough to be compared with sludge titans such as Crowbar and Eyehategod. I was blown away by this extremely heavy opening track since I love it when a band successfully tries something different.\n\nOther experiments include Randy's clean vocals on \u201cInsurrection\u201d. As far as I know this is the very first time that Randy Blythe did a clean and melodic kind of vocal for a Lamb of God track. He does this very accurate and the double-tracked vocals (a deep voice and a higher cleaner voice) are mixed very well, which is of course a compliment to producer Josh Wilbur. Besides these two examples, there's also the epic and ambient \u201cKing Me\u201d and silent/heavy contrasting \u201cThe Number Six\u201d. These kinds of tracks might surprise the average Lamb of God fan.\n\nOverall, Resolution sees the groove metal band return to its signature sound. Typical riffs such as the chorus riff of \u201cGhost Walking\u201d shows much similarity to Sacrament's \u201cRedneck\u201d. \u201cThe Undertow\u201d must remind you of \u201cAs The Palaces Burn\u201d-like songwriting. It pleases me to realize that this band actually has a signature sound that made them what they are and I believe they should be given the space to showcase their sound. Unoriginality wouldn't be the right term to describe this for they are just doing what they're good at.\n\nThe album is well-produced. It sounds much more solid than Wrath, but thankfully not as overproduced as Sacrament did. Drums sound solid as usual. Of course the bass drums are triggered as usual. I'm sure a lot of people will have complaints about the fact Chris Adler uses this, but I personally think it fits Lamb of God's polished sound. I don't believe it shows the laziness of the hairy drummer. Sometimes I get the feeling the vocals are a bit low on volume in the mix. Besides these kind of minor details, the album sounds rock solid.\n\nLyric-wise, I am always very impressed by Randy and I was once again not disappointed by the words written by this noisy frontman. The Bible references and political edges to his lyrics have always been great in my opinion, and you shall find his signature kind of lyrics once again on Resolution. The track \u201cInvictus\u201d is lyrically my favorite so far.\n\nTo wrap it up, this album is just kickass. Though I think it won't be a classic like Ashes Of The Wake, it sure as hell is a great addition to Lamb of God's discography. Fans of the Virginian band who are in for some experiments and also love the traditional LoG-sound will surely get what they wished for. I was impressed by this record. Lamb of God remains the same old great band and at the same time they try things they've not played or recorded before and do it with great style. No doubt that this release will end up in a lot of top-metal-album-lists at the end of the year!\n",
        "\nNow probably many people would say for this album that it's the \"same old\" and so on. Well, really they didn't change their sound much, nor did they change their style. They're not completely innovative, nor are they way-over-head-mind-blowing. They're simply a good solid band that does what they're best at and sticks to it \"until the end\".\n\nAs I was saying previously, the band didn't want to change their sound much, yet you still have a pretty good sound and atmospheric variations in each song from 1 to 12 (yes, not counting the \"King Me\" song since it's a total disappointment and the \"Barbarosa\" song), and the vocals are pretty much well worked over. What comes to everyone's surprise, and of course mine, is Randy's \"clear\" singing in the song \"Insurrection\". I don't know what the band and Randy thought they would achieve with this minor change in vocal style, but it's not completely and utterly bad, but still needs improvement though. \n\nWhen it comes to sticking to what you're best at, Lamb of God really knows their stuff. The riffs are solid, classic \"Morton & Willie\" pinching, hammer-ons, and other stuff, varying from sludgey and slow to fast and somewhat insane. A good example of their classic work is the \"To The End\" song. Some would say Pantera-stolen, or some other stuff pretty much related to the \"stealing Pantera's legacy\" stuff, but I think it's bullshit. The song is well worked over in both rhythm and riffage, it's solid, stands it's ground, the atmosphere is good, the drumming is awesome, and vocals are pretty much standard, and even though it does remind of Pantera, and I say this for about thousandth time, it's not Pantera, nor will it ever be. That would be the same as saying that Metallica = Diamond Head, and that's also bullshit.\n\nAs far as drumming parts goes, we can clearly see that Chris improved his drumming abilities way more since the \"Wrath\" album. He works well with riffage and plays his own important part in the whole song creation process, so no complaints there. Bass lines are also pretty much solid, and Campbell seems like he has no real interest in improving his bass abilities to a complex level, but really, he doesn't have to. He's a solid bassist and keeps the bass gap filled.\n\nLyrics are pretty much standard anti-everything messages. The vocals though are a bit more better than on \"Wrath\" with minor...well, minor \"errors in experimenting\", but it can happen to anyone, because, let me remind you, they are still and only human and they're not supposed to be \"perfect\". \n\nAll in all, the album is pretty good, better than \"Wrath\" because it goes back to the \"pre-Sacrament\"-era a bit more, and I give it a solid 75%. Why 75%? Well for starters this album would get more praise if it weren't for 2 minor and 2 major things that bother me. Firstly, two minor things that bother me are: \"Ghostwalking's\" similarity to \"Redneck\" (from the \"Sacrament\" album), and some a bit unnecessary experimenting. Secondly, we have 2 major \"mistakes\" the band has made: the \"Barbarosa\" instrumental and \"King Me\", the closure song for the album. I don't know what the band was thinking when they recorded these two and what their purposes were, but the album could have gotten easily through with only 12 songs, or 13 if you count the newly-issued \"Digital Sands\" song. \n\nSo to close the review up, I recommend this album to all who like a good headbang, somewhat moshy songs, and all in all, good newly-bred music with a hook on late the '90's sound.\n",
        "\nAs I was reading through reviews of this album, I felt obliged to write my own. I'm going to be sincere and say that other reviews are \"painfully boring\" as some other reviewers referred to this album. As my review title says, this isn't the greatest album of all times, but it deserves some praise. Nothing new, \"same old\", as some refer, Is pretty OK with me, I mean look at Mot\u00f6rhead they drive the same sound, same riffs since 1975 and they're still awesome. But let's go on with the review and start off with the vocals on this album.\n\nThe vocals on this album have pretty much improved in quality. Although they don't sound so \"brutal\" or completely non-understandable as Varg Vikernes, I find them, objectively, pretty much OK, they add up to that grim, aggressive and tortured sound lamb of god always had, and I'm glad they stick to it. I'm also glad that the band has songs that vary from melancholic \"Grace\", with a kind off a tortured ring to the vocals, to \"Contractor\" with somewhat aggressive, hardcoreish, thrashy ring to it. Many people refer to Randy's voice as \"bad\" or \"pussy\". What exactly is \"bad\" or \"pussy\" about Randy's voice style? Is there a school for growling and screaming (Maybe there is, anything can happen nowdays)? A handbook on \"How to be truly brutal\"? No I don't think so. It's just hater talk and internet no-lifer music arguments. If you don't like it why bother with it? As far as the lyrics go, they're OK too, standard Lamb of God. Good messages and somewhat poetical expressions are not bad at all, and they most certainly not are \"what people would like to hear, so we can sell ourselves out\" kind of lyrics. They're more or less intellectual and philosophical in a rude, punkish kind of way.I don't consider them brutal, but surely they're worth paying attention to.\n\nAs far as the riffs go, they're pretty much standard, though some varieties in guitar sound occur in different songs, but I'll come to that later. I don't consider that riffs are \"stolen from Pantera\", because they don't have the same composition nor that certain cling to it, but surely they are widely Pantera influenced, and it is completely understandable to me that at certain points they would sound like Pantera, but when you look at it objectively, it's a completely different thing. As far as originality goes, Lamb of God sounds original enough to make me pay attention to their music. As i said before, they have some influences, but that doesn't make them \"not original\", though some of the riffs sound mediocre, but I don't look at it as a completely bad thing. I mean to a rookie ear all death metal sounds the same does that mean that only Death was a true and first death metal band and that anything other after Death is not true? No. Lamb of God has their own way with guitars, their own sound, and that makes them original. The riffs have a dark and grim sound somewhat melancholic harmonics too, they vary from more to less aggressive, which is OK and makes you bang your head. The breaks are OK too, nothing too slow and \"painful for your ears\" as deathcore, just a right combination of upbeat rhythm and slam guitar picking, enough to make you mosh or continue banging. And just to be clear, they are not metalcore because of the breakdowns(which do not even sound close to bands like As I Lay Dying, Parkway Drive etc.), by any definition possible. People need to learn the definition of some words before they use them, and at least some basic music related terms. Lamb of God is simply a technical(more or less) groove metal band with a bit more hardcore and death metal influence, and that's what this album represents. Whether you like it or not it's up to you, but don't spread around pointless hate because it's idiotic.\n\nTo sum it all up, I recommend this album(to whom it is new, of course) to all who like something gloomish, not so extremely brutal, but brutal enough to make your heart pump faster and makes you want to F*@%& the whole world up just because the music slaps your brain with it's drilling sound.\n",
        "\nYour enjoyment of this record will be inversely proportional to your expectations of LoG doing something new and different.\n\nLoG are in the awkward \"fame\" position where they are not held to greatness enough to get away with rehashing old formulas (like Slayer), but at the same time they don't have the reputation for odd innovations and unexpected twists to justify any 180s (like Mastodon). When you get to the top by creating a unique and brandable sound, you become hostage of the situation you've created and LoG are illustrating that perfectly for the third album in a row since they unleashed the close to perfection Ashes of the Wake.\n\nOf course it's not like LoG aren't trying to introduce something alternative here and there. You have the sludgeriffic opening track, various acoustic guitar interludes, a couple of prominent bass lines from John Campbell and a completely out-of-the-blue closing track which I can only describe as symphonic metalcore. But it's the 11 tracks in between these left-fielders (I excluded the instrumental track Barbarosa) that are the backbone of this release and cause so much debate about LoG role on the metal scene.\n\nAnd the other thing is the duration. You make your record close to an hour long only in two cases: either you feel that you have something very important and different to say and you simply must leave all of it in, or you are doing fan service and simply churn out 'more riffs for the same price'. Since there are no new themes or sounds for the majority of Resolution, I believe it is the latter and with that you get the idea, where LoG's priorities are.\n\nhttp://rateyourmusic.com/~rodion_z\n\nAt the end of the day you get same old: Chris Adler is magnificent behind drums, Mark Morton and Willie Adler are a dizzying guitar duet and Randy Blythe will rip out your eardrums. The only problem is - there are only so many times you can get your eardrums ripped before you lose sensitivity to it.\n",
        "\nOriginally posted on my reviews blog as heavymetalspotlight.blogspot.com/\n\nI must admit, I don't listen to as much Lamb of God as I used to, but a new album by a band so well known is enough to draw upon the curiosity of all but those most committed to excommunicating metal's mainstream side, and in all honesty, I am not one of those people. If you count Burn the Priest, \"Desolation\" is the band's seventh studio album, and as many prophesied, is pretty much consistent, as the band have been for a couple of albums now.\n\nAs I see it, Lamb of God released \"New American Gospel\", which sounded like groove-metal in a washing machine, went down an interesting road on \"As the Palaces Burn\", then wrote \"Ashes to the Wake\" and have been doing albums roughly like that ever since. This album is no exception, and aside from the occasional vocal diversification, which began to rear it's head in \"Wrath\", the album is definitely similar enough to be placed in the \"more of the same\" category. Not, might I add, that this is necessarily a bad thing; You can criticise the sameness of their material if you like, but it's also true that they're good at doing what they do. Listening to the album, it seems that the songs are all quite solidly written and don't contain too much throw-away material, something which the band have always managed to an extent. As always, or, perhaps, even more than usual, the band have some monster choruses, which are memorable to the utmost degree, and is definitely something refreshing to listen to on my \"Right, I'm going to listen to something today that's quite accessible\" days. \n\nOverall, the album seems faster than the band's quintessential material, with a stronger thrash influence than that which was minimally present in Wrath, albeit in this album a lot better done. In contrast with the earlier material, there seem to be relatively fewer moments which \"jump out\". I'd say that the songs are just as good in many respects, but seldom did an intro occur to which ensnared me to listen to the song above the others. Making up for this, in a way, the middle of the songs seem to have a lot more going on, and when the mundanity of the intros has passed, most of the songs are very solid. One of the fascinating things on the record is the presence of the occasional experiment, straight out of the left-field; Tracks like \"King Me\" with it's symphonic keyboards really takes the bands sound in an interesting, albeit slightly haphazard sonic direction, and the clean vocals on \"Insurrection\" really do sound cool and interesting, even when in your heart, you know that it sounds rather sellout-esque.\n\nAll in all, for all the shtick that Lamb of God get, the new album definitely isn't too bad. All things considered, I'm quite impressed. It's not going to by my album of the year, and I doubt I'll feel the need to listen to it constantly, but frankly, it was a good listen, and to an extent, it's re-kindled my interest in the band a bit.\n",
        "\nIt's finally here, Lamb of God's \"Resolution\". We had our doubts, our beliefs and now all of our questions will be answered with this album! I must say this is definitely Lamb of God's best thus far, from beginning to end this album starts with a powerful track (\"Straight for the Sun\") and then ends with a powerful, yet melodic, finale (\"King Me\"). I listened to the entire thing at least 3 times since its release and I must admit there's nothing wrong with this album.\n\nFor starters, Lamb of God has stuck with their early-era roots, but somehow managed to change or re-create them in a different way. Everything sounds new and modern, but in a way the \"old school\" vibe of the band lingers and manages to stay there, they just made it sound more clean. Compared to LoG's other releases it's pretty solid and in place. Pick an album like Sacrament or Ashes of the Wake and compare it with Resolution. There's a giant difference in terms of quality and sound, LoG's earlier albums were a but too distorted and messy around the edges that you couldn't distinguish what was being played. Resolution on the other hand was definitely a resolution for the band and they tried to avoid their previous fuck-ups and turn it around with some clean and audible tracks. The guitar solos dominate the tracks, Morton executes these beautiful sweeps and melodies that are just mind blowing, and example of this will be found on almost any song on this album, but you'll hear it most on \"Ghost Walking\". Chris Adler's drum work has always been the best and it still is on this instalment. Blythe's vocals are actually good this time and he can extend them for gratuitous amounts of time. This album is clearly nothing like Wrath and that's a good thing, Wrath wasn't bad but we just don't want a repeat (in other words: we don't need a Wrath II).\n\nThis album blew my mind away and it's definitely LoG's best album they've made thus far, they've come a long way from Burn the Priest to Lamb of God in full form. I absolutely recommend this album to any fan, new or old, and if you've haven't heard of Lamb of God, this album is a good way to start.\n",
        "\nThis is the band's second release, it has a killer track and sound that still gives me chills down my spine. As people always say: \"old is better\", is it not? At first I was a unsure of this album because the first song I heard from LoG was \"Set to Fail\" on their latest album, Wrath. I really liked their new album and thought it was great. I then decided to pop this piece into my stereo and all I can say is, where to start?\n\nFirst off, this is a hell of a lot different than their other albums. In terms of sound it's full of grit that's raw and edgy. Oh, did I forget to mention that the sound quality had a major setback? I did, didn't I? Well, let me tell you that the songs are great and all of the songs sound good, but they are greatly unorganized and sloppy. Some parts in most songs are better off left out rather than kept on the album. For example, the intro to \"Blood Junkie\"...how you hear that weird screech from the guitars, I find it very unattractive and hard to listen to. If I were Mark Morton or Willie Adler, I'd make the tracks sound crisp yet clean with less bullshit on my plate, please. Unless you're a fanatic of Machine Head's \"shitty static\" noises on their album \"The Blackening\", then I think it's safe to say that stuff like that on \"Blood Junkie\" should be left out if they want better feedback. They only feedback I'm getting is from Morton and Adler's amplifiers. Talk about rough.\n\nIf it's not static/strange feedback noises then it's definitely some sloppy riffing. Take Vigil, for example. It sounds great and mighty through the beginning and middle, but when it reaches the end? The tremolo picking was just messy that displays some skill, but is still messy. With everything paused, the guitars bounce in and then Chris Adler jumps in with some sort of beat and then everything starts to unravel from there. Way to ruin the moment, guys. All in all, the guitars sound like a mesh of clean chords mixed with some mediocre distortion, not that I hate it, but it wasn't \"Palaces''\" best feature. Blythe's vocals are fine, good even, but they're not powerful. They don't pack a punch that gets that adrenaline flowing. With a little more practice and some good execution, Randy will be ripping up the stage with vocal power.\n\nBesides the setbacks and \"Anti-LoG\" rants, this album is pretty good. Not that I'd just pop it in and listen to it every day, but it's an album that can be listened to for a short duration. It also lacks power and you can tell after the first few tracks. It's lacking because the distortion is satisfactory and not \"edgy\" enough. This album is fifty-fifty depending on the listener. If you want to listen to it, then go ahead. If it's the opposite, then turn away and don't look back.\n",
        "\nThe very first time I heard this album, I swore it was a completely different band. I had only recently become a LOG fan and was only familiar with Lamb of God post-Ashes of the Wake, and when my ears were exposed to the very first Lamb of God album, I was not a fan of it by any means. The production was paper thin, the drums (even though the playing was phenomenal) sounded like cardboard, the guitars sounded like they were recorded through a wall, and the vocals... well... haha. I flat out hated it. But as time progressed, I began to fall deeply in love with Lamb of God, and so I thought it was time I put all opinions aside and give New American Gospel one last go. My thoughts this time around were much better than before, so lets get this god damned review on the road.\n\nThe album starts off with the absolute crusher of an opener, \"Black Label\", with pounding guitars, drums, and bass. Its definitely a mosh pit favourite. It's also one of the best off the album. The only thing that lets the track down is the horrible roaring coming from vocalist Randy Blythe, apparently recorded the whole way through stone cold drunk. The next two tracks, \"A Warning\" and \"In the Absence of the Sacred\", are absolutely fucking great. \"A Warning\", just like \"Black Label\", explodes out of nowhere and really announces itself. It also features a blast beat, played furiously by drummer Chris Adler. \"In the Absence of the Sacred\" is my personal favourite off the record with the band giving it 100% all the way through and for once I can actually bare Randy's vocals which seem very fitting to the song.\n\nAfter such a solid opening, this is where the album takes a turn for the worst. While not a bad song, \"Letter to the Unborn\" just plods along sounding quite uninspired and just another run-of-the-mill extreme metal song, as do \"The Black Dahlia\" and \"The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion\". Descending further down the trail of mediocrity is \"Terror and Hubris in the House of Frank Pollard\", containing guest vocals from the album's producer, Today is the Day's guitarist/vocalist Steve Austin. To be frank, the vocals are horrible. They're shrill and extremely high pitched, but on the bright side they make Blythe's screaming sound amazing in comparison. \n\nThe last third of the album really ends the album in an extremely positive light. \"Pariah\", a song about a run-in Randy had with his friend (who was a drug addict), is a perfect addition to any Lamb of God concert set. Well performed by the band throughout. \"Confessional\" follows in the same light, rocking hard with the band giving their all. The album closer \"O.D.H.G.A.B.F.E (Officer Dick Head Gets a Black Fucking Eye)\" not only holds the title for best song title ever, but is a fantastic album closer.\n\nLamb of God's 2000 debut album, New American Gospel, starts off fantastically only to be let down by a weak middle and then a great last portion. While not the greatest album, New American Gospel introduced the whole world to Lamb of God, we embraced them, and they embraced us five albums and countless shows later. Lamb of God have proved that they are here to stay. Whether we like it or not.\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\nProduction:\n\nWell, it's pretty damn piss poor, but the band/producer did what they could with the amount of money and the amount of time they had (which wasn't much). The guitars are paper thin and the drums, in particular the snare drum, sound horrible. The bass is inaudible. Randy's vocals are the only part of the album that sounds mildly professionally-recorded. However, this doesn't stop the band from performing brilliantly.\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\nIndividual Performances:\n\nCHRIS ADLER (drums): fantastic from beginning to end and never a dull moment listening to him drum. A hugely important element to Lamb of God's success. \n\n10/10\n\nMARK MORTON/ WILLIE ADLER (guitars): fantastic performance as well from Mark and Willie while some riffs on Gospel... seem to be very stock/run-of-the-mill guitar riffs. They were and still are giving guitarists everywhere a run for their money.\n\n9/10\n\nJOHN CAMPBELL (bass): it's almost impossible to review a bass performance when the instrument is barely audible.\n\n?/10\n\nRANDY BLYTHE (vocals): compared to other LOG releases, his performance here is by far my least favourite. He seems to fail to produce notes. Just simple noise. He has improved greatly over the following albums, and I can see nothing but improvement from here on in.\n\n4/10\n",
        "\nI honestly don't see why people hate this album so much. I really don't get it, it could be because they like the \"old\" LoG or maybe it's because they're not used to the band's different approach and sound. Sure, this is the same Lamb of God that we know and love, but there's something different about this album. There's no constant cookie monster vocals that we get from Randy Blythe, instead he alternates between \"brutal cookie monster\" and \"Cancer Bats\" vocals. Chris Adler's blast beats have gotten faster and are definitely mosh material, the snare drum has changed and it sounds like a trash can when he hits it, but on a serious note, who gives a fuck?\n\nThe guitars have always been the same, nothing different and nothing new. It's basically the same as their last album and the album before that: raw, full of grit and blazing solos with a twist of nice harmonics. The whole band have really stepped-up their game and took it to the next level in which I think is a big and good level, on a scale of 1 to 5 in terms of intensity, I would say it's a solid 4.\n\nSure, it might not be a solid favorite, bit it's definitely something to listen to at least once in a while, there's nothing wrong with this album. Period. You can't hate it, but then again you also can't love it. To make a long story short, I'd say the \"Palaces\" album was better. I think LoG should stop trying to hard and to just let the music flow instead of choking the hell out of it, it's just not their best, but it also isn't their worst.\n",
        "\nLamb of God has a high reputation among the modern metal community being often one of the favorite bands of metalcore kids and after numerous recommendations from different people; I picked this album up for the sake of analyzing the direction of the so called \"new wave of American heavy metal.\" Before explaining the music on this album, I would like to point out how painfully boring it was for me to go over 44:50 minutes of bullshit. Although pretty successful commercial and financially-wise, I just can't help but agree with the old clich\u00e9 of \"business kills good music.\" and here is why.\n\nL.O.G is a mainstream band very popular these days and this album put them on top of sales and charts, However, this is not even a close indicator of success on heavy metal works. This album is not bringing anything new or innovating to the genre, far from that, They are destroying everything that was cool about metal, the songs are boring and very predictable, there is neither anger nor attitude, neither speed nor technicality as fans claim this album to be, In fact, I find this album to be insipid and forgettable at best. \n\nTo describe the music I will start with the riffs. The guitar sounds heavily influenced by Pantera (and I particularly don\u2019t find to be this a good thing)almost rip off in some riffs, the lack of explosion and aggression mixed up with the repetitive and monotonous-lame progressions in some songs like \u201cGrace\u201d or \u201cContractor\u201d tries too hard to sound headbanging fast and aggressive but fails miserably. Some melodies like the bridge and the solo of \u201cSet to fail\u201d are not completely awful bad although totally uninspired. The acoustic passages are just dull and tedious, it seems like they wrote them just for the sake of having acoustic intros because probably they think a cool album \u201cmust include an acoustic guitar somewhere\u201d and I don\u2019t say this because I don\u2019t like acoustic passage myself but because they sound tired and tries too hard to sound impressive. Far from that, they are completely unnecessary fillers for weak-written songs.\n\nNow concerning the band altogether, I have to point out that the structure of the songs are far from impressive, intro, verse, chorus, verse, breakdown. Breakdowns. This is probably what I dislike the most. In songs like \u201cReclamation\u201d I find it extremely boring and pointless of what I call fillers of a song excluding the drummer that I would call at least decent. Just a few songs features a guitar solo, although they are very far from cool solos, at least they occupy a couple of seconds in the song and could be easily the closest you can get of the \u201cenjoyable\u201d part of this record so to speak.\nThe vocals are not guttural death metal-like and are not thrashing evil screams either, the singers sounds like my little sister on her period when she gets mad. It\u2019s far from cool or scary and I personaly can\u2019t stand his voice nor his words. The lyrics are stupid and it seems like they were written by an angry down-syndrome kid, I mean seriously, what the fuck were they thinking when they wrote this.\n\n\u201cYeah motherfucker, let's take a ride \nWe're rolling Route Irish, someone has got to die \nTrick or treat, it's IEDs, \nSo roll the dice as we leave, \ncuz it's eight miles of pure luck \nwith more bang for Sam's buck \nGuaran-fucking-teed, someone will bleed\u201d\n\nI mean: Whats his point? What the fuck was he thinking about when writing the lyrics, I am almost ashamed of reading this. Anyhow I just can\u2019t take them seriously and fail to understand where did the spirit of the old metal. It seems like there is no longer need of balls and good songs to make a famous metal band. In my understanding they are the lowest on the food chain of heavy metal.\n",
        "\nOverall, Lamb of God sucks hard but this album does not. Ignore everything else they've recorded. Don't even go near them. As The Palaces Burn is all you need. I'm not a big fan of groove metal but this is fine stuff if I can say so myself. Guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler know what they're doing here. They put on some displays of Exhorder thrash influence but (relatively) technical groove metal is the aim. Pantera is an influence with the most obvious being Randy Blythe's vocals as with the bass role and riff structure. But Lamb of God on this LP dispense with the false fury and attention deficit disarray of their Southern contemporaries for a more specialized groove laden album. The guys playing on As The Palaces Burn play hungry but it's not an appetite for commercialism kind of hunger (though that's exactly what they ended up doing after all.) It's an ambitious effort to bulldoze you with scalloped thrash riffs. \n\nThe first thing that caught me was the daedal patchwork signatures on Ruin. I thought Willie Adler added great style to accompany these riffs. It always helps when such a skillful drummer is in command like this. He's not a real fast drummer but he is a machine no less. It's almost like the rest of the band is trying to keep up with him. I really don't like that type of breakdown that the song has but his drums kept me interested despite it. The title track sounds very similar towards Ruin at the end. In most cases, that would be lame but this was set down purposefully to keep the pacing consistent with their technical approach. The band is giving out that \"world is burning\" and other fire and brimstone attitude to the repetition. \n\n11th Hour is the gem on the record. The opening of the former is very catchy and doom styled. It mostly keeps at a steady rhythm at first before changing out into faster more melodic package of scales like something you would hear from Dark Tranquillity. Boot Scraper does probably sound like Job For A Cowboy at the outset with a curious knack of transitioning to some very apparent Cowboys From Hell stop-time patterns. And Willie Adler's opening roll on A Devil in God's Country is taken directly from The Art of Shredding. When the track started up, I for a second thought the iTunes player had somehow went random and played that Pantera song. This song though is the heaviest and most intense on the record and Pantera only wished they could be this heavy. Randy Blythe's presence on the song gets lost though. He's fairly decent on the record overall but thankfully the speed, repetition and instrumental heaviness is what keeps him from becoming annoying. On Blood Junkie he starts to wear thin on me and they should have left this track on the cutting room floor. The song stalls compared to the others because it's not exuberant in the guitars and the catchiness is not as plentiful. \n\nMany have already made up their minds about Lamb of God and with it, this record so there isn't much I can persuade with. The people that will be interested in As The Palaces Burn (and who have not heard most of it) are the ones who have seen the band in concert or listeners of Gothenburg. But the album is predominantly groove metal. To those people, I advise you listen closely to the album for the instrumentation. Lamb of God has mostly played metalcore throughout their career but there is not an ounce of that to be found on this record. I cannot emphasize more that this is strictly groove metal. There is some very good stuff to be found from that type of sound and this is an example.\n",
        "\nLamb of God\u2019s music has changed greatly since their Burn the Priest days, let alone since \u201cNew American Gospel\u201d, where breakdowns were a staple then. All these albums though features Randy Blythe\u2019s unique growls, and \u201cWrath\u201d is no exception, though this album makes more use of screams compared to their other works.\n\nThe production is clean and polished, which further conceals the well-ignored bass. Although the music is mainstream-influenced, it still flows nice and smoothly, like their past albums. The drums are perfect. It is always on rhythm and most of all, it doesn\u2019t sound garbage. The guitars are still low-tuned and still capable of good riffs and solos. \n\n\u201cSet to Fail\u201d is the first song here you\u2019ll surely like. The speed of its intro and its impact (since it\u2019s a single) made me like it. \u201cGrace\u201d is melodic, yet rocking. Its solo is quite melodic for groove metal, but yes, I like it. \u201cDead Seeds\u201d definitely reminded me lot of Pantera. It was quite moving and is one of the heaviest songs of the album. \u201cChoke Sermon\u201d is sure to start a mosh pit. It is definitely fast, loud and heavy. Good solos included. I hate \u201cContractor\u201d the most. I hate it that they have to put a slow part and a disgusting breakdown in the middle of the song. Another song is \u201cReclamation\u201d. Listening to it makes me nuts. It sounds out of place, and they should have put something fast and lively instead and breakdown-free too. \u201cFake Messiah\u201d has an annoying ending filled with repeating riffs, making it bad.\n\nOverall, this is a good album. I don\u2019t think LoG haters should be allowed to review this album. It\u2019s good metal even though it\u2019s mainstream, but they should realize that this isn\u2019t a near-perfect album. It has too much metalcore influences, if you ask me. I hope these guys strive more to spread the gospel of metal.\n\nOriginally written for http://mystifymsyerie.blogspot.com\n",
        "\nLamb of God are no strangers to either end of the metal spectrum, as they have become something of popular metal darlings in the last few years. Though \"As the Palaces Burn\" was their gateway into success, it seems to be pushed aside for the more familiar and more polished offerings that superceded it. I find this to be a mistake, given that while \"Sacrament\" and most recently, \"Wrath\" are indeed quite decent, they are nothing I would choose over this one. That said, I doubt very seriously this band could ever pull off anything quite like this one again.\n\nFor all its simplicity and at times, inconsistency, \"As the Palaces Burn\" is a rather fun listen, particularly for a modern American metal band. The fact that they manage to stand out of the Killswitch Engage clone factory of metalcore is a plus that can only work to their advantage. I wouldn't necessarily heap boat loads of praise on this band nor even this album, as seems to be a favorite activity of the mainstream media. Instead, its a sign that not everything churned out of the U.S. in the 21st Century is bad, bland or simply boring. In fact, I actually found myself having a good time to this album, as opposed to the \"meh, its okay\" attitude of subsequent offerings.\n\nThe musicians here are quite competent for what they're challenged with here, with is basically groove metal with a few sparse traces of melodic death and to a lesser extent, thrash. Chris Adler does give a commendable performance behind the kit, and one of the things I've always liked about this band was their drummer. Randy Blythe gives off more of his usual quasi death barks and comes off the weakest member in the band, so its business as usual there. I will tack on here that the production quality is rather raw compared to later efforts, and this forces Blythe to compete with the music instead of overpower it. That right there might be one of the reasons I enjoyed this album so much more than the others. \n\nWe start off with \"Ruin,\" which possesses a few tempo changes but otherwise runs the usual Lamb of God formula. \"Boot Scraper\" also exhibits this to some extent, as does \"Blood Junkie.\" I've found that the better songs off this album are actually the ones that seek to be something other than per usual groove metal. \"11th Hour\" is an example of this, which throws in more changes into the mix but also is one of the catchiest songs Lamb of God have ever put together. I can remember it well, even though I havn't listened to this release now for a few days. \"Vigil\" is a similiar story, with its somber introduction, it seems like more of an experimental number though it then moves into the usual straight-forward metal. Both of these songs work the best on the entire album, and stand easily as highlights. Yet that doesn't mean any of them are truly slouches, either, as both are enjoyable groove with a few energy shifts thrown in to keep it steady. Naturally the repetitive factor comes into play on songs like \"For Your Malice,\" but this is easier to overlook given the better quality of songs here.\n\nAfter having \"As the Palaces Burn\" for a number of years and keeping up with LOG over time, I can say for certain this is the best they have to give. Its not necessarily the \"masterpiece\" I've heard championed as, but it is quite enjoyable for what its worth. Its an unusual take on groove metal, but its groove metal nonetheless with a signature Southern flair that one could trace back to some of Pantera's offerings. Yet taken as a whole, this album is still very fun to listen to and at less than 40 minutes of material, the album does not become repetitive or tedious to withstand, which is a key problem in most American bands today. So quit gawking over the inferior display of subsequent efforts, and reach into the past for \"As the Palaces Burn,\" which was and still remains the best time you can get out of these Virginians.\n",
        "\nI originally had the desire to ignore this album and simply not write a review on it but its seems to be haunting me to get my take on this nonsense. From the already posted reviews, there is a heavy mixture of feelings towards \"Ashes of the Wake\" and Lamb of God in general. The majority of the posts here are all saying things that are legitimate, whether it be positive or negative. The end verdict, at least on my part, is that Lamb of God can be compared to ice cream. Listening to them a little can be enjoyable, but extended listens can induce painful headaches and an urge to stay away from them for a while.\n\nIn my younger years, I loved bands like Pantera and Machine Head, and still do to some extent, so my opinion on Lamb of God closely follows those two bands. All three of these bands (and many others in the groove realm) can write interesting songs so long as they keep the song lengths adequate with the idea pool and stay away from five, six or even seven minute sonic boredom. Pantera got better at this as time went on, though Machine Head never did figure it out before they sank into mediocrity of the lowest degree on \"The Burning Red,\" and Lamb of God seems determined to follow suit. While I did not think \"As the Palaces Burn\" was mind blowing awesome, it was enjoyable for its compact length of just under 40 minutes. The album presented some interesting things going on, and the raw sound quality kept Randy Blythe's interference to a minimum. \"Ashes of the Wake\" is not so fortunate, attempting something memorable but falling down a staircase in the process.\n\nThe music here is not entirely different from before, but with a few missing features. For one, I loved the way \"As the Palaces Burn\" sounded with its sub-standard but not unbearable sound quality. It possessed a sense of raw charm that kept me from selling it a week after I had it. \"Ashes of the Wake\" is cleaner in sound, and simply funnels off the ideas from before. Sure, those ideas worked on the previous album, but on this album, they become stale and simply boring as time moves on. Instead of manifesting any real creative stride here, as any major band should aspire to do at some point, we simply run off a well of mid-tempo energy. The riffs aren't particularly noteworthy, though there are a few exceptions, and Chris Adler does push himself to catch the listener's attention every once in a while. Chris Adler remains my favorite musician in this band, and remains the strongest link in the chain.\n\nA few noteworthy songs to toss out there would be \"Hourglass,\" \"The Faded Line,\" and \"Omerta.\" None of these three are particularly amazing, as they end up becoming above average groove metal. I can tolerate groove metal so long as it presents interesting concepts relative to its song durations, which these three songs do. The spoken word introduction to \"Omerta\" is a nice touch considering its lyrical content but begins to grow unnecessary on repeat listens. \"Reclamation\" also presents a few interesting things going on, including contrasting sections that hold together well enough. This band has always put their best material in the last song, just too bad \"Reclamation\" doesn't have alot of competition in terms of quality.\n\nAside from the instrumental mishaps and stagnation that occurs, the weakest link on this album and in this band is Randy Blythe. Plenty of others have said it but it bears repeating that he is not only monotous in his delivery but also very grating. I have heard a number of annoying vocalists defile my sense of hearing including the singer in Mastodon, but Randy Blythe takes the cake. To dissect what he sounds like, it honestly sounds like the quasi-death growls Phil Anselmo did on \"Far Beyond Driven\" mated with the bark of a coyote who suffers from a bad case of constipation. The wretched spawn of this mating then became Blythe's voice, which he decided to share with the world in his quaint little band. However, even this is not the worst part of this album, which I dive into in the next paragraph.\n\n\"Ashes of the Wake\" was spawned in the year 2004, the year that every musician and his mother decided to voice their political opinions. Naturally, the heated opposition to George W. Bush and his brand of unquestioning Nationalism spawned alot of angst directed in the political realm, but very few bands approached the subject with any iota of intelligence. The best example of this, of course, was Green Day who refined the art of making a jack ass of yourself by approaching politics in a comical and unintelligible way. Lamb of God does this slightly better, but keep in mind the comparison. The band violated Songwriting 101 in that you are not supposed to write songs that are very current, which this album is. Its very anti-Bush and anti-war in its message. Its not so much whether I agree or disagree with their opinions, its that these opinions are shoved down the listener's throat. I absolutely detest bands trying to force their views on the audience, which is practically what 90% of those who voiced their opinions in 2004-2005 ended up doing. Considering most of the lyrical content on this album is obsolete as I'm writing this, it only proves my point. MegaDeth and early Sepultura knew how to write political songs that would be relevant years after its composition, not becoming a relic of a bygone era less than five years after its release. Apparently, Lamb of God did not get that memo.\n\nIn the end, I do not look kindly on \"Ashes of the Wake.\" This band has gotten better as time has marched forward, although their evolution is a painfully slow one. Part of this album's pit falls is the lack of interesting concepts thrown into an album that is trying to be something ambitious. This occurs with most groove metal bands out there at some point, just look to how \"The Blackening\" played out. The other part is the lyrical writings, which seem like they were written out of angst over something very real yet had no real direction and instead tried to make something simple out of something that is very complex. If politics must be included in a recorded music form, they should never be current and/or specific, the two areas this band based their writings on heavily. To potential buyers, I'd simply say leave this album for the vultures as it offers very little that this band has not done better either before or since. If you absolutely must hear this, then seek it out at the bargain bin for $3 and don't even think of going any higher.\n",
        "\nI first got a swing of Lamb of God some years ago when I first heard the songs \"11th Hour\" and \"Vigil\" off \"As the Palaces Burn.\" I bought it, and fairly enjoyed what I heard. I kept my eye on the band for a while, but I was disappointed with their next two releases. \"Ashes of the Wake\" saw the band take a step back in terms of songwriting not to mention the bad idea of writing lyrics about current events and jumping on the \"political statement shoved down your throat\" bandwagon that consumed music in 2004. It wasn't so much that I disagreed with that vehement anti-Bush, anti-Iraq War opinion it stated, but just like Green Day they displayed their opinions in a more unintelligible manner than I could respect. Not to mention, it was extremely current, which meant by the time \"Wrath\" was released, most of the subjects on \"Ashes of the Wake\" were lyrically obsolete.\n\n\"Sacrament\" was slightly better, showing some ideas being manifested instead of an album running off raw emotion and the occasional burst of energy. It still wasn't something that reminded me of why I enjoyed this band in the first place. So when \"Wrath\" was announced, I was cautious but decided to pick it up anyway. I was impressed with the improvements made on this album, even though it suffered from most of the issues of its predecessor.\n\nFor one, we have a few songs off \"Wrath\" worthy of mention but we also have some that are more \"meh\" than \"wow.\" This isn't anything new with Lamb of God, it was even present on \"As the Palaces Burn\" but not to the extent that it was on their previous two. Here, the songs are of better quality and even have some characteristic to them, but in the end, I couldn't remember but a handful of these songs even after three spins. Some of the riffs are even memorable, even if they aren't incredible or intricate. Chris Adler once again is my favorite man in the band, I always liked his drumming style and he gets better here.\n\nThe songs worth mentioning are few in number, but they are some of the better songs this band has done since 2003. \"Set to Fail\" is good, even though its ideas are limited and reminds me a bit of the Southern swing style that \"Redneck\" showcased three years earlier. Maybe its just me, but I detect it ever so slightly. \"Contractor\" is one of the more aggressive songs by Lamb of God, which I'm sure will become a concert favorite. That song there actually pulls itself over anything the last two albums could offer by becoming more than mid-tempo groove and is short enough to stay interesting. I particularly liked \"Grace,\" which funnels in some of the hostile nature \"Contractor\" possessed but not to that degree. Its introduction is similiar to the album opener \"The Passing\" in that its more serene and calming, just the perfect lull into fake security before the riffs open up. The final track in \"Reclamation\" is one of the better ending tracks Lamb of God has done in a long time. I'd put on par with \"Vigil,\" maybe even slightly higher than that one. Lamb of God always put their best songs on the bottom of their albums (which I understand these songs are usually Mark Morton's primary compositional credit) and this one does not disappoint. \n\nThe remaining songs aren't necessarily bad, as \"Dead Seeds\" is fairly memorable even though it basically runs out of steam by the time it ends. \"Everything to Nothing\" is a similiar story, but is slightly better. Overall, \"Wrath\" gave me a spark of interest that \"As the Palaces Burn\" did, but I still can't rank this album on par with that one. \"As the Palaces Burn\" had me enjoying its raw but charming brand of groove metal from start to finish with only a few areas where my mind wondered. \"Wrath\" isn't as fortunate, even though when it picks up, it gets good.\n\nThe biggest problem facing Lamb of God is that while their evolving, its a very slow evolution which means whatever negatives get thrown at them will likely be around next time. The band is learning to craft their songs into better and better outputs, but the charm of \"As the Palaces Burn\" is still not being reclaimed. Maybe it was the raw sound quality that album fed off of, which I personally enjoyed, and probably because Randy Blythe wasn't as \nin-your-face in the mix as he has been since. His vocals are pretty fucking annoying as time moves on, and on repeat listens he's the one band member I try to ignore. Blythe has gotten better over time, adding a little variety here and there but he will never rank as one of my favorite frontmen. Whatever the case, he's the trademark voice for this band and I'm sure he'll be there for some time to come, but Blythe still gets on my nerves at times.\n\nI can't completely throw this album under the bus. Yes, it still persists with some of the problems \"Sacrament\" had, but it packs more of an aggressive nature than the brooding, often watered down groove its predecessor had. I listen to it every once in a while and it is officially my second favorite Lamb of God album. Not being someone who goes ape-shit over them, this isn't saying much, but rabid fans definitely should seek this out. Its an improvement in most ways, but still not as fun as \"As the Palaces Burn.\"\n",
        "\nLive DVDs are rather tricky, they\u2019re either really good, or they completely suck. That is the case with this split DVD Unholy Alliance. Featuring Slayer\u2026and a bunch of talentless side acts like Lamb of God. And let me tell you, this is completely forgettable. \n\nSlayer sounds like a good band to see live don\u2019t they? Maybe not on this DVD but in general yes they would be. Slayer plays only ten songs ranging from good early ere to bad new ere. The worst part about their performance other than some of the songs would be the triggered drums. They just sound so clunky and you can tell that they\u2019re there. Tom\u2019s voice is also not the greatest, but that\u2019s mostly due to age, so you have to deal with that. The crowd is into their performance, every time the camera focuses on someone in the crowd they\u2019re usually flicking off the camera. Some of the songs are actually very good, \u201cAngle of Death\u201d sounds awesome, and \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d also another good one, probably the best song out of the bunch. The green smoke on the stage during the songs also is pretty cool. The new songs still suck even life however, \u201cCult\u201d is horrible, easily their worst song. I found it kind of weird how \u201cReign in Blood\u201d wasn\u2019t on here, after all that is probably the most famous Slayer song. Still Slayer gives the best performance on this DVD and they\u2019re the only reason why anyone should even get this. \n\nAfter the Slayer performance we have Mastodon, and they\u2019re the second best act on here, but that\u2019s only because their competition would include Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, and some act that you probably never heard of. I just don\u2019t get their style, like what exactly are they? They have a lot of groove in their bass, yet a lot of mindless guitar leads with their guitarist. Generally the songs are simple, with basic bass work and a simple rhythm, them some random solo comes out of nowhere. These guys in general are nothing more than a hard rock band with a few interesting solos here and there. The most interesting thing about their performance is that \u201cCapillarian Crest\u201d has an interesting audio clip in the beginning of the song. \n\nNow we come to what is the worst song on the DVD, and it\u2019s by no one other than Lamb of God. We all know these guys suck on album, but holy shit there are unlistenable live. They play \u201cVigil\u201d which I guess is their best song, but like all Lamb of God songs; it sounds like every other Lamb of God song. Basically groove chugging riffs, lame solo, breakdown, another chugging riff, and songs over. Halfway through the song he spends about a minute trying to get the crowd to form a circle pit, but what\u2019s annoying about it is that he is still using his annoying singing voice. Apparently this guys normal talking voice is the exact same as his singing voice. After hearing this song I\u2019m just glad their on stage for only five minutes.\n\nChildren of Bodom would be next, and I\u2019ve never really cared for these guys, mostly because they\u2019re so boring. \u201cAngles Don\u2019t Cry\u201d is dull, sounds uninspired as if they didn\u2019t want to perform it in the first place. Alexi still can\u2019t sing. He\u2019s basically doing hardcore shouts for the whole performance. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d starts off with chugging riffs and an annoying keyboard lead. Alexi still uses hardcore screams, only he\u2019s even more emotionless. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d is just one of those modern teenage oriented metalcore songs, basically the lyrical content of the song is \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck motherfucker\u201d over and over in the chorus. Just like Lamb of God, they\u2019re forgettable.\n\nThe final band is Thine Eyes Bleed, who I never heard of until I heard them on this DVD. I can see why now too, they\u2019re basically modern melodic death, so they got some metalcore influences. Worst thing about their performance is hands down their vocalist. Basically he is your typical monotone singer that consists of hardcore shouts, and ear bleeding shrieks, much like the vocals from Blythe on Lamb of God. Slower groove passages, a weak solo, and ends with a chugging breakdown is how this song goes. Drumming is also annoying due to the fact that the drums are triggered. Triggers are annoying especially when there used with nonstop blast beats. This is just a terrible way to end the DVD, although considering how almost every performance is mediocre to horrible; I guess it makes sense to end it this way. \n\nSo this DVD has gotten a dubbed production job. You know the one where the songs have that semi live feel to them. Every performance has triggered drums; everything has been worked on to sound sharper, crisper guitar sound, more audible bass and what not. But that takes away the whole live feeling of it all. There\u2019s also no intermission or switch to the next song. After every song the screen cuts black, then the band name and the name of the song they will play appears, then it kicks right into the song, there\u2019s literally no interaction with the crowd whatsoever except for the quick Lamb of God bit. \n\nWell considering how only Slayer is worth hearing, and considering how only about half their songs are also worth hearing, this is just a really bad DVD. The guest acts\u2026well all suck really, playing generic metalcore songs at best by all of them. Slayer is the highlight of this album and only six of their ten songs are worth hearing. So if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now you can completely ignore this DVD.\n",
        "\nLamb of God continues to remind me why I despise most mainstream music (In Flames still holds a place in my heart). Generic formulas and repetitive musicianship to please the masses. Wrath is nothing more than a rehash of all their previous albums. They haven't progressed since their first album and they never will. They just keep perpetuating the same music under a different name so all the br00tal kids have something new to slam dance to every few years. If you've ever heard a Lamb of God song, you've heard them all. Wrath is no different.\n\nThe album kicks off with an acoustic guitar doing something you'd hear in a melodic break or an outro. Despite being out of place in the song structure, it gets 2 points for sounding decent. Then all the tranquility is shattered by some really generic melodies and a simple 4/4 drum beat. You know, the guitar melodies where they hold contrasting notes for a few seconds each? Great. The mainstream formula/song writing/musicianship is already in play and I already know I'm going to hate this album. As the song ends, I say to myself, \"Holy shit! That song was instrumental!\" 2 more points. A half-assed melodic instrumental intro gets 4 points. And those are the only points this putrid shit gets. The next song kicks off with the same bullshit all their other 3 minute songs do. Annoying pseudo-thrash riffs (a half-assed attempt to sound like Pantera), fills and breakdowns at every turn (not to mention the kit sounds like a bunch of tin cans) and inaudible bass (as usual). \n\nIn retrospect, Lamb of God have a hard time utilizing and understanding competent songwriting. A breakdown is supposed to be a break in the music. You cannot have a fucking breakdown at the beginning of the song! In Your Words follows a formula of breakdown-fill-breakdown-fill for at least 2 minutes. If you think that's bad, it only gets worse: every song on Wrath has it. Perfect for the mallcore kids! It's also perfect criteria for being removed from my music library. \n\nThere's only one more piece to the puzzle: Randy fucking Blythe. Easily one of the worst vocalists in music today. He attempts to fuse growls and screams, but it comes out like someone gurgling salt water. To make matters significantly worse, he never shuts up! A common trait of -core music. Lamb of God is metalcore with thrash influences (although their thrash sound is almost nonexistent). Myth debunked! If this guy would stop barking and drowning out every instrument, they wouldn't be a total shit stain. \n\nWhat does make this album slightly different from their other indistinguishable records is the 7 minute track (technically 6 due to the unnecessary silence). I was hoping for progression with this song, but my hopes were nothing more than a quixotic fantasy. It's exactly like their 3 minute songs, but double in length. What LoG should have done is split the song in half and made 2 new songs. That way people who are hoping for a step in the right direction aren't deceived. This album is truly an uninspired, auditory nightmare. What seemed like hours was only 44 minutes. I could not wait to turn this shit off.\n\nUntil Lamb of God use their brains, I'll be passing on all future endeavors. I have serious respect for anyone who can listen to this let alone like it. If hell existed, this is what it would sound like.\n",
        "\nI got motivated to listen to Wrath because of the single \"Set to Fail.\" While it wasn't brilliant in any way, it was a nice song worth a listen, and I liked the small shift in their sound. So I headed over to Myspace for the free streaming of their new album...\n\nMy first thought: \"What the hell?\"\nMy second thought: \"Oh... nevermind.\"\n\nBasically, the opening track caught me off guard, and even got me excited. One of the biggest criticism for Lamb of God that I have is that their music writing tend to be really stagnant, and \"The Passing\" seemed as if it totally blew off that predictability. But then you hear the next track come in, and you realize your first impression was totally wrong.\n\nWell, my first impression was not completely wrong. To me this record was more interesting than Ashes of the Wake and definitely more than the stuff I heard off of Sacrament or As the Palaces Burn. Tidbits here and there, like graceful intro for \"Grace\" (no pun intended, it really is graceful) and thought-provoking intro/outro of \"Reclamation\" provides nice dynamic contrast to their signature thunderous, clear, and mechanical riffs and detailed drumming. There are some really cool ornamentation too, like the non-western melody dancing around in the background towards the end of \"Fake Messiah.\" With Lamb of God, you KNOW you are getting chunks of nice riffs - that's vital if you are a metal band, and LOG's got it down. \n\nElsewhere, the first few tracks also feature Randy Blythe actually singing (but still harshly) as opposed to throat-tearing screams, though he goes back to the same ol' from there on. The lyrics are \"meh\" as well. In later tracks, guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler starts to blend more primitive riffs in place of machine-gun rhythm riffs, although thankfully, they wisely steer clear of alternative/nu-metal type of riffs that Dimebag Darrell indulged in with Damageplan. The overall sound seems lighter than before too, though not necessarily \"softer.\" That doesn't really matter after you go through a few songs though, because it starts to sound equally heavy anyway.\n\nSadly enough, these changes and qualities weren't enough to impress me. To be fair, it was actually a satisfying listen - everything good about this band are still served hot and plentiful, and new condiments are welcome. Hell, if I find a used copy of this in Japan (with bonus tracks), I might even end up purchasing one. But I cannot help but to feel that they still remained predictable, and individual songs were not very memorable. Some songs even sounded like you've heard a million times before (\"Contractor,\" \"Demon Seeds,\" \"Broken Hands.\"). Earlier albums like Ashes of the Wake were flawed but impressive. The songs from those albums were not unforgettable individually, but their overall style of sound definitely was, because it's subtly unique. By contrast, Wrath is more consistent than their previous efforts as an album - it's not as monotonous and not as singular in its songwriting approach. But somehow it fails to make a big impact. \n\nDon't hesitate to listen to it though if you are curious - i'ts not a life-changing experience but is not a failed album either. If I was a fan of the band, I might have given them 80% to 90% score on a merit that it's faithful to their formula and delivers stuff that fans would want and expect. But I'm not really a fan, and this album did not make me want to call myself a fan. Hence the score as set above.\n\nIt's about time Lamb of God does something different, even if it's just a little. But then again, maybe they are trapped in their own little world where they can only impress and gain praise from their existing fans, but unable to expand their audience or remain fresh and relevant. And maybe it's too late to alter that status quo.\n",
        "\nThree years later and Lamb of God follow up on 2006's brilliant Sacrament. It's now pressure time, can Lamb of God surpass themselves or simply flop? \nChris Adler said in an interview about the upcoming album \n\"This album is going to surprise a lot of people.\" Which to LOG diehards would almost sound like an atomic bomb going off, were LOG writing an accessible radio friendly album? Would Randy really be dropping his trademark bark to croon on a song or two? Thankfully the answer to both of those questions is no, however the answer to the aformentioned question, they have neither flopped, nor surpassed themselves. \n\nThey very rarely step outside their comfort zone, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but when they do Lamb of God can be very interesting. The two biggest examples being Grace and Reclamation, the former implying some very melodious guitar work with the latter being a grueling trudge through heavy slow riffing hell. Wonderful. \n\nOf course there are tracks that speak post-thrash pantera groove vibes. Contractor, Broken Hands and In Your Words being prime examples. Then there is a slight shift in Mark Morton and Willie Addler's guitar work, swapping from a chugging groove to thrashy Bay Area '80's riffing on tracks like Set to Fail and Everything to Nothing. \n\nOn Wrath Lamb of God in places are just as raw as they were when they recorded As the Palaces Burn, whilst keeping the intensity of Ashes of the Wake and the heavy chugging grooves that made Sacrament such a monster. Every contributor doing their job brilliantly, Chris Adler adding more credentials to being one of the great modern drummers, whilst Randy Blythe's primal bark is just as evil as ever. \n\nNot exactly reinventing the wheel, but damn this is still pretty good. \n\nRecommended: Set to Fail, Grace, Broken Hands and Reclamation. \nNegatives: Dead Seeds and the fact the album doesnt seem as complete as Sacrament.\n",
        "\nThe main question for me when first listening to this album was: does this measure up to past Lamb of God albums? Unfortunately, I don't think that the album does quite measure up. In particular, the riffs aren't as catchy as they were on previous releases, especially Sacrament. The riffs on Wrath aren't exactly bad, they just feel somehow less inspired. But they're certainly as technical as, say, anything written by Hetfield (including on RTL and MOP), so I don't really understand the complaints that the band can't play. It's just that as far as memorability goes, there's not enough here to make this a truly outstanding album. It's merely a good album. I do have to say in Lamb of God's defense that the acoustic guitar and clean bits (The Passing, Grace, Reclamation) are all enjoyable, and are a nice step forward by the band.\n\nThe bass doesn't really come through all that much through most of the album. To double check this I skipped around the music at random on my computer, and I couldn't hear the bass in any of the places I listened at. I do remember hearing the bass a couple times when the guitars were transitioning from one riff to another, but overall it's pretty buried in the mix. The drumming is as it's always been on a Lamb of God album: I guess some will consider that a good thing, and some will consider that a bad thing.\n\nI've never been a huge fan of the lyrics of Lamb of God, and this album hasn't changed that for me. It's not that the lyrics are completely horrible, they just don't really keep me that interested in what's being said. As far as the vocals go, they do indeed sound somewhat like Phil Anselmo. That's just the way things are with Lamb of God. If that's a turn-off for you, then you probably aren't a Lamb of God fan to begin with. The main problem I had with the vocals on this album is actually that there was at times too much variety in too short a time. Sometimes Randy went from talk/singing to a deep growl to a scream, all within a short time span. There was also the tendency to start a line with one vocal delivery, and finish with a completely different vocal delivery. Sometimes that can work, I guess, but it doesn't seem to work when he tried it on this record. However, I do generally like Randy's deeper growls, and I do give him credit for trying some new things in the vocal department.\n\nA couple times while listening to the record I was strongly reminded of another band's music. This happened the first time at the beginning of the second song, when the riff sounds similar to a riff on the Kreator album Hordes of Chaos. The same riff also sounds like the opening riff on the second song of the As I Lay Dying album An Ocean Between Us (which album also, coincidentally, started with a short instrumental). The second time I was reminded of another band's music was during the song Choke Sermon (at about the 1:42 mark), where they play a riff that sounds like it's from the Megadeth song Set the World Afire. The second similarity in particular makes sense, as Megadeth has been described as one of the main influences for Lamb of God (something that was said on the Walk With Me In Hell DVD).\n\nIn the end, as I already said, this album doesn't quite meet the high expectations I had after Sacrament. It's by no means a bad album, and the band is showing growth by incorporating some new elements into the music. I just think it's a small step backwards in some other respects. But if you're into metalcore, or are a Lamb of God fan--I know, not likely on this site--then there's no reason not to get this album.\n",
        "\nFar from anything remotely catchy or attention grabbing, the three minute songs here will bore you before they\u2019re even half way through. I\u2019m not disappointed because this album sucks, but because it\u2019s no joking matter anymore. While I could use this stuff when I\u2019m in the need of a good laugh, I would still prefer if it never came into existence. \n\nThe riffs present here either consist of random bends and pinch harmonics on the 6th string, or basic melodies copied from some melodic death band. Some moments in here are so bland and ridiculous that even a bunch of 14 year olds won\u2019t do something like it while jamming with their newly formed amateurish band. Coming to the variety, I\u2019d say Adam Sandler\u2019s movies vary way more than the songs on this album. You just won\u2019t be able to figure out the difference, thanks to a vocal performance almost admirably narrow and one dimensional. How one is able to sound exactly the same in every song is a talent in its own way. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing new about this release, it is typical Lamb of God, with its signature trash can drumming, uncreative riffs and flat tyre bass. The only little thing that surprised me was the fact that one song here was 7 minutes long. Usually, one would introduce some complex progressions and transitions in a track as long as this, but not LOG. The song is just silent for the first 20 seconds and then starts with some chord picking. After that, we are again back to typical LOG, just another 3 minute song dragged for five-six minutes. And oh, the last 20 seconds are totally silent as well, so technically, the song is not more than six minutes long. \n\nHardly three or four songs have solos, which shows how limited their musical abilities are. They are all based on the same formula of three crappy riffs and two groovy fills, as far as the guitar goes. You know which one I think is the best? It\u2019s the opening track, The Passing. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t have any vocals, the melodies are not bad, there are no lame attempts to sound \u2018out of the box\u2019 by the drummer and at 2 minutes long it\u2019s the only track which doesn\u2019t overstay it\u2019s welcome. \n\nI loathe this band\u2019s and its fans\u2019 dyslexic approach to music and they are a skid mark in the face of true metal. The only thing they can do successfully is delude people and ruin the genre\u2019s name. Utterly devoid, bankrupt & bereft of any artistry whatsoever, they go on playing rakishly and are surprisingly able to create countless more boneheads who are ready follow them on the path of buffoonery and downright stupidity. The mere pungent whiff of their despicable success makes me nauseous; if only there was someone to halt this pestilence.\n",
        "\nLamb of God releases their fifth album today and Wrath is the successor to the hugely successful Sacrament. I thought that last album was alright and had a couple of genuinely kick ass songs so I approached this new album with a fair amount of anticipation.\n\nWrath starts off with a typical slow melodic instrumental intro before the first proper song In Your Words kicks off with an opening riff that is reminiscent of the first song on the new Kreator. Not the same riff at all but just reminded me of it. Then as I was sitting through the opening song I realized something. There were no metal core breakdowns happening and the song was melodic and even had a slowed down part without sounding like the band had gone to Gothenburg. In fact the feel of this album is decidedly old school. The production is warm and not the plastic over produced sound that the band has been peddling, the drums seem trigger free and even when the inevitable breakdowns happen they are not as mired in clich\u00e9 as they used to be. Pantera still seems to be the main influence though and Blythe still sounds a lot like Anselmo but coming from me, that\u2019s not really a complaint.\n\nMost of the songs on this album sound like an extension of Walk with Me in Hell and Redneck from the last album but with a much more old school feel. Contractor\u2019s thrash reminds me of Exhorder but the slowed down part is all Pantera and Anselmo, Fake Messiah also has some good thrash vibes and is a pretty good song while Dead Seeds is some more Pantera worship.The best song on the album is the opener In Your Words with its thrash groove going head to head with a slowed down melodic section.\n\nWhile this is definitely the best album by the band that I\u2019ve heard there still isn\u2019t a lot to recommend here. Sure, the songs are alright but the band is very heavily indebted to Pantera and like with Sacrament these songs are not going to hold up too well. I got this feeling that I\u2019d heard all of these songs before and halfway through the album it just becomes background music except for when I went, \u201chey, this sounds like Pantera, that sounds like Exhorder and was that an Exodus part there?\u201d\n\nThe album starts off well but ultimately promises a lot more than it ends up delivering. I\u2019m sure the fanboys will love this and they should because this is the band\u2019s best album yet. Unfortunately, that\u2019s still not saying a lot.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nNow this song is apparently receiving lots of negative feedback from certain people and I can understand why, since Contractor wasn't that great of a song after all. What's to say about the band in general, I can't call myself a bigger groove metal fan or anything but Lamb Of God does indeed stand out from many of the repetitive Exhorder/Pantera follower bands. The technical guitar riffing of Mark Morton and Willie Adler, Chris' talented and original drum work and Randy's aggressive vocals have always kept me interested in this band. Records like As The Palaces Burn, Ashes Of The Wake and Sacrament were all awesome but this song is not like that. I could compare Contractor to the Sacrament single \"Redneck\" as they both have at least one thing in common: being first single and the worst song off the album same time. Yes people I did manage to hear the entire Wrath album (a friend of mine downloaded it and sent me the songs) and I can tell this is the worst.\n\nNow this song starts right off with a \"WEEEEEEEEEEE\" yell then comes couple cymbal hits (or maybe hi-hat, I'm not sure) and the song starts flowing with some Lars Ulrich-speed beat, double bass, fast palm muted chug riffing and vocals. This goes about 13 seconds and then the palm muted riffing goes bit higher and you'll get some gang shouts among Randy's growling. The song slows down in the chorus to introduce some groove riffing and Randy growling something among the lines of \"Guaran-fuckin-teed, someone will bleed\" but at least it's not really a breakdown. After the chorus you'll get the beginning riff again and the same pattern to the chorus is repeated again. \n\nIn the middle of the song the instruments suddenly stop and guitars fade to silence with a long chord and a small bass solo starts. Not really an interesting bass solos, just couple notes in a groovy pattern. Then you'll get Randy yelling \"someone has got to die!\" and the guitars kick in with a similar groovy pattern as that bass solo just a moment ago. The drum beat is yet again slowed down for the groove. After this little groove section ends you'll get out of nowhere starting a fast kick-ass riff and soon fast drums will kick in again among this riff and Randy also does a long scream on the top of it all. Right when Randy's scream ends you'll get loads of double bass from Chris Adler and then the chorus appears one more time and the song ends.\n\nRiffs here are mostly palm mutes and grooving chords. There's not a single guitar solo in this song which is of course a bad thing and that disappointed me quite a lot in Contractor. Bass is almost inaudible apart from the short bass solo in the middle of the song. Now drumming isn't that special in this song since there's hardly any fills and the drum beats are quite predictable but the double bass section at 2:32 was pretty damn good. Chris Adler can do much better than this but for a song like this I think he did ok job. Randy's vocals however sound quite annoying here, he sounds pretty tired and and cracky and he just can't reach the aggression he had on Ashes Of The Wake and As The Palaces Burn. But at least he still has the wider range he represented in Sacrament.\n\nNow I'd say this song does indeed have its moments but honestly an entire album full of this would equal crap.\n",
        "\nAs a precursor to this review, when I first heard \"Laid to Rest\" on my TV, I hated it, but slowly and surely, I realized why Lamb of God is hailed so highly in the metal world, and this is truly the record that started their ascent. \n\nAs \"Ruin\" erupts from whatever speakers you're listening to, it's plain to see that Lamb of God deserve to be described as pure american metal. They have a more original tone and playing style than one is used to, and has a southern tinge to it as well. I have listened to many a death metal band; At the Gates, In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, etc, and I can honestly say that I hear influences, but not the degradation of their recycled riffs. The production on this album isn't the best, but I believe Devin Townsend was going for a fittingly raw sound for a raw band. It is true that the bass isn't that present, but it does its job adding to the devastatingly heavy parts or breakdowns in the songs. The drums are phenomenal, with accents that aren't typically used in most metal bands. The guitar tones are sometimes a bit lacking, but come off more unique than your typical cookie-cutter metal band stuff. \n\n\"Ruin\" at first may sound boring, but once Randy's razor screams enter the mix, one knows that Lamb of God is here to stay. His sound has evolved greatly from New American Gospel, which just made him sound like a novice behind the microphone. His timing of delivery is perfect and combined with the riffs of Mark and Willie, they paint a picture of destruction and chaos. At first listen, I thought Lamb of God was a Middle-Eastern metal band due to the less popularly structured riffs, but this simply adds to their originality. As \"Ruin\" ends, it bleeds life into \"As the Palaces Burn\" which just has a groovin' chorus that's instantly catchy. Randy' lyrics are a perfict fit for the song, which can be interpreted as being about the war in Iraq. The short length is done tastefully, as it acts as a closer to the opening of \"Ruin.\" \n\n\"Purified\" keeps evolving as you listen to it, and makes you look like an idiot when you first try to go with the flow of the first major breakdown. The solo here has an odd tone, as it is drowned in the mix but cuts through just enough for you to know its there. \"11th Hour\"'s sound truly lives up to its name. The brutal composition gives soundtrack to the approaching apocalypse, internal or not. From the drumming, to the fast-as-hell palm muting, to the well delivered vocals and thought out lyrics, \"11th Hour\" is a serious standout. \"For Your Malice\" displays the unconventional chord structures that has helped garner LoG's respect and popularity in the underground. Randy begins with a spoken word piece, and bursts into his typical rage. The atmospheric guitars compliment the thrashy rhythm and disappear in time to emphasize the main riff. \n\n\"Boot Scraper\" seems like LoG studied Messhugah for a while and came up with this dizzying intro. The rest of the song is their standard stuff, with a cool solo and alright ending. \"A Devil In God's Country\" takes a standard metal riff, adds some odd timing to it, and hooks you in with a catchy chorus. It also seems like Mark and Willie decided to add some more Messhugah with the song's solo, which shares some main characteristics with the Swedish math metallers (being the elongated notes that don't sound like it's coming from a guitar and instead a synth, the doom-like feel to the tone, and the lack of movement within the solo itself). \"In Defense of Our Good Name\" has a badass beginning and is followed by the standard good stuff. It has a decent vocal chorus that's also kind of catchy, and Chris shows what he's got on his rolls and double bass afterwords. \n\n\"Blood Junkie,\" to me, seems to be the weakest part of the album, not being able to stand out moreso than the previous tracks. The beginning sounds like a dissonant metalcore riff, followed by a spoken word piece that is near indecipherable, due to its low volume. The rest of the song isn't bad, it's just not phenomenal. \"Vigil,' however turns the last song on its head as it begins with an odd clean-toned riff, backed by an ever descending bass riff, that invokes sadness at first and sinks so low, you just want to take a shower you feel so dirty. Randy blasts through the soft stuff with a religious-like slew of verses. The playing isn't as fast in the beginning, creating a doom metal quality that is very refreshing. And just when you think the song will end, it grows wings and takes off to a blistering speed that ends the album perfectly with an excellent climax and descending action, and just a brutal outro by all members.\n",
        "\nSo this is one of Lamb of God\u2019s best songs I believe. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like them and have heard only a handful of their songs; but this is their most talked about song along side Laid To Rest (which didn\u2019t impress me either) so I gave it a try yesterday. You know, when I come across bands like this I just for some reason become curious to know whether all their songs are this bad or they actually have a couple of decent ones. Well, this one certainly hasn\u2019t changed my opinion on this talent less band one bit so I\u2019d say, no. \n\nFrom Randy\u2019s one dimensional vocals to the same repetitive guitar riff, this song sucks just like any other by them. It starts with some Children of Bodom-ish riff which is played for almost 40 seconds until we have the next riff which actually surprisingly goes well with the first one. But oh, as soon as the vocals come I am reminded of the fact that I\u2019m listen to Metalcore, something worse than melodic death or power metal with harsh vocals. There\u2019s really no riff during the verse, it just in infamous and irritating chugga chugga. At about three and a half minutes we have a solo; almost 30 seconds long, this is by far the best, or let\u2019s says, the only good moment in the song. The last 70 seconds of the song are just comprised of the main riff and Randy telling us to walk with him in hell. That\u2019s it folks, this is the best they can do.\n",
        "\nJust like the line I mentioned above, this track makes no sense whatever as you must have figured out. I have never been a big fan of Metalcore but Lamb of God always stood a step ahead and a class apart from all other bands in their genre because of their last two albums, which were decent and had a few cool tracks.\n\nThis new single is, well crap. It sounds a lot like the work they did in their earlier days, which was useless to the very \u201ccore\u201d for \u201cmetal\u201d. Ah, so that\u2019s how they came up with the name of this genre - \u201cMetalcore\u201d?\n\nNow, as for the song, pretty much everything about this song is amateurish and bad. The vocals are possibly the worst thing here. They sound like a kid trying his first attempt at growling. The production is equally bad because the bass is completely lost in the mix. The only guy who has a truckload of talent and is very good is Chris Adler, the drummer and he, like a pack of cards has fallen along with the band.\n\nThe song structuring is pretty bad too. The band tries to change their tempo time to time and instead of falling in place they band just falls apart. A perfect example of this would be when the song suddenly stops all of a sudden mid track to give way to a bass riff (though it\u2019s actually pretty much just a sound made off of a bass guitar) and is the only time you can hear the bass. Before I forget, the track starts off with Randy screaming like a little child shouting \u201cWEEE\u201d. Hell, this entire track sounds as if it was made by a bunch of kids.\n\n\u201cGuaran-fucking-teed, \nSomeone will bleed. \nGuaran-fucking-teed, \nSomeone will bleed. \n\n(Someone) tries to conceal off the night, \nBig Business is booming, life's here to force them to lie. \nNo need for all the formalities, Jump the kangaroo corpse, \nand flank beneath the trees. \n\nYeah, motherfucker, lets take a ride, \nRunning red lights in a green zone, \nsomeone has got to die. \n(Pity me?) There\u2019s nothing here to see, \nso throw the dice for me please, and let's \nStore the pint of blood to cash in to refund\u201d.\n\nIf anyone reads this review, my e-mail ID is given in my profile. Please explain to me what this means as soon as you manage to decipher it.\n",
        "\nI'll be the first to show how much I detest poser tripe and stupid mallcore shit, especially bands like As I Lay Dying, Job For A Cowboy, All That Remains, and the list goes on. I absolutely loathe those bands, but for some reason Lamb of God always was a bit of a in between band; I won't lie... Ashes of the Wake was a pretty decent album that had some sweet songs (Laid to Rest, title track) but the rest of their discography was always far hit and miss. Their newer stuff is pure garbage, not pure American metal. It's a lame term as well. \n\nSo at this point in time I only somewhat spin Ashes of the Wake and completely ignore the rest of their discography; when people ask my opinion on the band I'll say if they never recorded said album they'd be 100% worthless and another sheep that's fallen into the big sea of shit. As of now they still are, Ashes of the Wake still isn't anything special but still it has it's moments that I actually enjoy. I wasn't expecting anything worthy with any of their future endeavours and even moreso when I saw the previous reviews, but I listened to it anyway.\n\n...and it's pretty lame for the most part. Starting off the song with a \"weeeee!\" as if they're jumping onto the sybian with buttholes wide open... Contractor starts off surprisingly decent. For at least 25 seconds or so I'm actually enjoying the opening riff and the tempo/speed. Then about 30 seconds hits and it's an utter facepalm moment. Shame it all went to hell so fast, I've listened to the song several times now and am still amazed they let this go to hell. The song continues with utter boring moments and weak attempts to creating some groovy riffing and lead work when it just comes off as simply \"mallcore\". The bassline is just something unnecessary and pointless, as well as the lyrics. I mean c'mon, I'm not expecting vocalist Randy Blythe and co. to be Chuck Schuldiner or whoever in the lyrics department but this is just plain stupid. I've always thought their lyrics were bottom of the barrel lame but it's gone too far now. \n\nRandy Blythe is another point I'd like show up; this guy has got some cool vocals at times... but not here. His vocals have gotten progressively worse since the Ashes of the Wake-era, at least then I found him tolerable; here it's just gotten more and more accessible and mainstream sounding, but it still has the same tone, I just don't get it. Lamb of God is officially worthless (as if you needed more proof) but here it is; their upcoming album Wrath is going to suck as much as the previous. All that wasted talent that could be somewhat discovered on Ashes of the Wake has been pushed aside like Britney Spears' dietrician. Fuck, this band is dumb... there was potential here as well, REAL potential! You could have done something with this jus tlike your career (well at least you'll be making money you cash fiends). Congratulations for being a mainstream band 'cause ya sure don't care about winning over anyone else but the mindless sheep.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s a shame that crappy bands like these have a fan following bigger than xyz. But the fact does not surprise me, after all, what do you expect from a crowd where a majority of people just want distorted guitars, double bass and some moron who can merely howl. It seems like mediocrity is the very foundation of this genre.\n\nThis pathetic little song keeps up the tradition by being utterly devoid of any ounce of feeling or identity whatsoever. It starts with a weird \u201cwheeee\u201d noise like one makes when on a roller coaster, and then SUDDENLY, we have double bass flying over the place and the vocalist starts trying to explain something which human ears cannot decipher. Not to mention, behind all this, we have the constant chugga chugga palm muting sound. \n\nThe song starts losing it\u2019s speed and goes dead at about 1:20, only to be followed by a bass riff which I expect from people who picked up the instrument less than a fortnight back. The whole thing then starts again, repeats itself yet another time, and voila, the excruciating experience is over. \n\nNew Wave of American Heavy Metal, the name is unoriginal and the music is uncreative. Please don\u2019t promote this crap!\n",
        "\nWith the dawn of the new century came a load of new ideas, one of those being in the music idea. The genre being \"metalcore\", as it is called, although being underground in the late 90's, a few groups helped this genre rise up from the underground and become the commercial monster it is today, one of those bands is Lamb of God. \n\nWhen this band first released their album as the title they are under now, they were nothing more than a basic metalcore type band to me, but eventually they grew more and more into the metal realm, being more influenced by heroes of the more popular metal bands of the 90's such as Pantera, and Machine Head. With all the change they were taking, they got signed after their 2nd release (third if you include the Burn the Priest album), and released this album which I believe to be there second best album. This album was important to the whole genre of metalcore itself, having the lead single on Guitar Hero and introducing a whole new legion of people to the somewhat extreme for of music.\n\nBefore talking about the music, I thought i'd talk about the production, which I find solid. The guitar is good in the mix, you can hear the riffs, and solos when played, the drums are quite audible, and the vocals are in the mix well also. The only problem I have is that the bass is a little quiet but whatever. On to the good stuff.\n\nThe album opens up with Laid to Rest, the song which is featured on Guitar Hero 2, and for good purpose, I believe the riffs are excellent, and to be honest, sound awesome (probably why they put it on guitar hero). The drumming in this song, and the album in general is pretty basic metal thrash/groove metal drumming, with the occasional good fill and cool drum lines. Metalcore is often crapped on for using breakdowns alot, which I think is stupid it gets crapped on, the bands that are \"true\" metal also use this, such as old cryptopsy(if you don't believe that just play a few songs on None so Vile), as well as Suffocation. While used on this album, I find that the breakdowns are well placed, and fun to listen to. \n\nSolos on this album are spacious, but sweet, with the biggest highlight for fans of solos being on the title track, with a solo from Chris Poland (Megadeth fame), and Alex Skolnick (Testament fame), as well as a solo from the two guitarists of the band. The guitar playing on this album is fun and creative enough that I can honestly say I think they are the best guitarist of the new genre of metal, while they may not be as awesome as Dave Murray/Adrian Smith, they know their way around the guitar. The main turnoff in the instrumentation is that the drumming is way more simple than the As the Palaces Burn album,which I found to be excellent, but this is probably a showing of the changes to a more groove oriented sound.\n\nMany of the lyrics deal with a anti war stance, and liberal stances in other things, while I do not offhand agree with all the material, I think it was all pretty well thought out stuff, the only exception being the spoken lines in the song \"Ashes of the Wake\", I just found that annoying and the only turnoff on that solid song. \n\nOverall, I found this album to be excellent, and probably could compare it to the Master of Puppets of thrash, or the Altars of Madness of death metal, while not as technical as other releases, it is largely influential on their own respective genre, as this album is to metalcore or possibly future genres of music to be pioneered.\n",
        "\nLamb of God just made one of those albums when you listen to the first song; you're instantly drawn to listen to the rest of the songs. This album is by far better and more challenging for the band than other pieces they have made. The CD itself is probably the best album they have made in the history of Lamb of God\n\nRandy's vocals seem to have improved a lot since \"As The Palaces Burn\". Randy's voice sounds stronger, with more emotion than before. They are on their way to become a very successful band if they keep work like this up. I do ask that Randy never clean sings because it\u2019s just not his thing. I\u2019d say just keep on screaming Randy because he has a pure talent for his high pitched growls. In the song Omerta I loved the beginning of the song. Here is a part from the beginning intro \u201cWhoever appeals against this law is either a fool or a coward\u2026\u201d So and, and so forth it\u2019s a genius thing to do.\n\nThe guitarist in the band has definitely improved as well. They seem to do more complicated rifts than before. Their solos are by far some of the best I\u2019ve heard. In songs \u201cLaid To Rest\u201d, and \u201cOne Gun\u201d Both of their guitarists work and sound well together with very impressive solos. They have a driving force behind their music that makes you want to listen to it again and again. This band is a very unique band, and I can sense that they have a very thrashy kind of feel to the band which makes them very interesting to listen to. \n\nJohn Campbell the bassist for Lamb of God is perfect. Absolutely nothing wrong with how he sounds. It is in perfect sync with Chris Adler AKA Lamb of Gods Drummer. It his toned right and played perfectly, and some of the rifts are actually kind of hard to play for bass. In my opinion he is absolutely perfect for this band.\n\nThe drummer, which in my opinion is one of my favorite drummers of all time, can play almost any style of music. Every beat I hear from him is impressive. I have been drumming for 5 years now and what Chris Adler does is still hard to do. He never sounds off when he plays he is on tempo very time. In the song One Gun his drumming is amazing and perfectly executed with every other member of the band.\n\nAll in all the band is well on their way to becoming very big, being sold in many stores like Target, or Best Buy. Which they deserve it they are a very impressive Thrash/Death band. Everyone in the band has given all they have for this talented band and in my opinion I believe it worked for them. Randy, Willie, John, Chris, and Mark are all talented musicians and they are a very impressive band.\n",
        "\nWell, this is a refreshing improvement. After the atrocious debut hwich boarderlined on hardcore, Lamb of God go for more of a post-thrash sound on this album, and they have thus improved drastically because of it. There's still minor traces of hardcore on this album, but they are thankfully few and far between. This album does indeed sound very Pantera-ish except with totally different vocals. I wouldn't call this album (or the two albums afterwards) metalcore at all. For the most part, this is straight up groove metal. I'm not paticulary the biggets fan of this genre, but the genre is occasionally good, and this album is at least decent.\n\nRandy's vocals improve drastically, he's no longer incoherently screaming into the microphone anymore, and you can actually understand what he's saying. The riffs also improved, and while there isn't a lot of solos on this album, the riffs for the most part carry the songs through.\n\nThe title track, Ruin, and Purified have to be the best songs on the album. All of which have great riffs and can be kind of catchy at times. None of these songs are amazing, but there at least good, and it's the next step towards Sacrament. The rest of the songs range from decent to slightly below average. Nothing else really stands out all that much, but at least this doesn't descend to New American Gospel stupidity.\n\nFor the most part, this album is decent, and is the next step towards their best album, Sacrament. If you like Pantera and groove metal as a whole, you'll like this album. If you like thrash, perhaps you might dig one song here and there, though I wouldn't really recommend getting the album. If you're a Lamb of God fan, you can't go wrong with this album, but for those that are first getting into this band, I'd recommend getting Ashes of the Wake and Sacrament first.\n",
        "\nSo this is where Lamb of God (formally known as Burn the Priest) started out. It actually took me a little while to get into Lamb of God, and once I did, I realized that they're actually pretty good. At the time, I had their new album Sacrament. Shortly, there after. I bought Ashes of the Wake which was also pretty decent. Then, I heard buzz about this album being the best. Knowing that, I deceided to get this album expecting to hear some more great riffs. This album does indeed have riffs, and it's quite heavy as well. However, there's just two little problems thta this album has.\n\n1.Randy fucking sucks on this album! It sounds like he's just screaming randomly during these songs. And his voice gets very annoying, especially after the first couple of songs. I've always wondered why this band has been labled as metalcore, and now I know why. There is a lot of metalcore and hardcore influence on this album. Randy's annoying screaming and the breakdowns make this sound a lot like a metalcore album. Thank god, they would ditch this style by Ashes of the Wake and just go for a straight-up post-thrash sound.\n\n2.The lack of variety, and solos also make this album very unlistenable. Every song is heavy as fuck, but that's all they are. There's no othe qualities that the album has. It's not catchy, it's not very interesting, nor is it even very hard to play. The formula gets very irritating to the point where you want to kill some babies. Hell, Unearth can even do better than this. At least they have melody, and awesome solos for a metalcore band. \n\nHowever, there is one listenable though not very good song on here. That being Black Label. It's nice and heavy, and the riffs fucking slay. Though, the vocals kind of butcher it a little. It's the best song on the album, though that's not saying much considering how the rest of the album is complete utter garbage. If you want to hear some good Lamb of God, get their newer albums, because they've certainly improved their sound drastically since then. Whoever says that this is better than Sacrament or Ashes is a fool. nuff said. Avoid this album at all cost.\n",
        "\nBlack Label be damned. Apparently, the first song on Lamb of God\u2019s \u201cNew American Gospel\u201d was named after vocalist Randy Blythe\u2019s drink of choice, and he was dead drunk when he recorded the vocals. And it\u2019s a damn shame he was, because he almost ruins an otherwise listenable album.\n\nThe songs themselves are decent, but Randy\u2019s indecipherable screaming is just irritating. Some songs you can get past it (\u201cBlack Label\u201d, \u201cIn The Absence of the Sacred\u201d, \u201cPariah\u201d), but the majority of the album is a chore to listen to.\n\nNot just because of the vocals, mind you. The drum sound is atrocious, with the double-bass having the dreaded \u201ccardboard\u201d sound. The drumming itself is fantastic, but the sound transformation it underwent during the producing stage killed it. Pity. The bass is good and audible, but usually doesn\u2019t stand out much, save for the beginning of \u201cConfessional\u201d, which also features impressive drumming from Chris Adler. \n\nWhich brings us to the guitarists. I do not understand modern metal\u2019s problem with solos. Sure, there\u2019s a solo in \u201cLetter to the Unborn\u201d, and some interesting guitarwork in \u201cTerror and Hubris in the House of Frank Pollard\u201d, and \u201cThe Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion\u201d, but really, for a band claiming to be \u201cPure American Metal\u201d, there are simply not enough solos. Sure, the riffs are good, but, as the old saying goes \u201cMan does not live on riff alone\u201d, or something like that. The lack of solos are one reason as to why I would say \u201cNew American Gospel\u201d is more of a hardcore album than a metal album, in addition to the slew of breakdowns and screaming vocals.\n\nOne thing that is outstanding about New American Gospel is the lyrics of Randy Blythe. His unconventional vocabulary makes for a refreshing change from the seemingly-juvenile \u201cI hate everything\u201d lyrics of your typical metalcore/hardcore band. Another positive thing about \"New American Gospel\" is the appearance of Today is the Day\u2019s Steve Austin in \u201cTerror and Hubris on the House of Frank Pollard.\u201d His \u201cduet\u201d with Randy makes for a disturbing atmosphere, and Austin\u2019s vocal delivery makes it possible to follow along with the lyrics printed in the booklet, which is a very appreciated change from Blythe's enigmatic howling.\n\nOverall, Lamb of God miss the mark due to horrible vocals, lack of solos, and atrocious production. If Lamb of God went back and rerecorded \u201cNew American Gospel\u201d, then maybe it would earn a passing grade. In the meantime, I recommend you pick up \u201cAshes of the Wake\u201d, of you want Lamb of God at their peak.\n\nHighlights: Black Label, Pariah, O.D.H.G.A.B.F.E., Letter to the Unborn\n",
        "\nAh what a great album! Don't let the other people who rate this poorly and label it as metalcore get you down, it's really not all that core-y at all and it is by far one of the best albums to come out of the so called New Wave of American Heavy Metal. \n\nFirst off- to refute the \"oh it's too repetitive blah blah they sound the same on every song\" people, check this, they are GROOVE metal. Groove. Metal. That means that they will establish a groove and keep it flowing, kinda like Pantera or other post-thrash bands. If you don't like repetition then I guess this album maybe would rub you the wrong way at first, as it did to me. The first time I listened to this, I wondered what all the hype was about. It took me about five listens all the way through to see exactly what this band has done, and now that I can see it I truly understand how wrong my initial feelings were. \n\nNow to review the actual music:\n\nFirst off the guitar tone is great- it's gritty and fits the low-end riffing perfectly. As each riff progresses and evolves, the music and mood moves with it and the guitarwork here is obviously just outstanding. Yes, there is lots of palm muting but it sounds really great, and plus those solos and sharp, fast, articulate, stuttering riffs are very difficult to perform, palm mute or not. Now that I think about it, the band really sounds like Dream Theater combined with a Death/Thrash band on this album which is really sweet. You might argue that the guitars use the Egyptian-sounding riffs/scales/modes too much, but it fits, since a lot of the music is about the war in Iraq, which is a Middle Eastern country as we all know :) What really makes the riffs great is how they combine that Middle-Eastern sound with normal blues pentatonic riffs to keep it \"rocking\" enough to call it groove metal. All in all, the guitarists are relentless and are quite talented.\n\nBass next- I wouldn't have guessed it, but this guy really can kick it into high gear! I had to see them live to see how he literally DOUBLED the guitars occasionally on some of the fastest parts on the album. Yes, with a pick, on fatter strings, he played twice as fast as the already insanely crazy guitarists. He's nuts. Totally earned me respect. Points off for not punching through enough though! Come on man, if you got it flaunt it!\n\nDrums- Outstanding. Perfect. Remorse is for the dead has by far the best military-style drum part in the intro I've ever heard. This drummer is so creative while obviously being a fast metal player at the same time. His fills are awesome, his addition to the groove is seamless, and he doesn't overdo it ever really. Great, all in all.\n\nVocals- Topnotch black screams. His voice is very good yet original and is instantly recognizable. The bellows, shriek-dives, and etc. are all astounding too. Randy also seems to know exactly when to just use one vocal layer or use many to make it sound like a choir of angry people want you to hate the Iraq war. Wow, he's a great one. I'm also glad that he didn't sing at all, it keeps up the edge all the way through. Points off for the spoken intro to Omerta though, it just sucks. Also the swearing is unnecessarily over-manly and stupid, people take your political opinions less seriously if you use the vocabulary of a high school student. But other than that the lyrics are really cool and have lots of deep metaphors and symbolism to them.\n\nThe overall sound is a great Pantera-inspired groove which etches its way through each song. The vocals, solos, and insane riffs punish your until you can barely take it anymore. The songs on the album flow very smoothly and lead to each other well, especially the title track into Remose is for the Dead. If you are a fan of Pantera, extreme metal, or just heavy metal in general, this album will not disappoint. Fans of power/melodic metal beware though: there is no room for pansy stuff on this very serious and brutal record.\n\nBuy it.\n",
        "\nLamb of God are a juggernaut in the modern heavy metal scene. Although Shadows Fall existed before them, LoG are routinely considered so innovative that they justified the coining of a new subgenre: New Wave of American Heavy Metal, an obvious throwback to that legendary era in British traditional/speed metal. To the unfamiliar, NWOAHM refers to the recent surge of American heavy metal bands that combine elements of thrash/groove metal and hardcore to form this unique blend of heavy music. For anyone that can form a musical opinion not previously spawned on MTV, the term is a glorified misnomer for American metalcore, which is certainly not new. Lamb of God, the genre\u2019s champions, are overrated filth that have gotten famous by utilizing the innovations of others and making them mass marketable. Ashes of the Wake is their third full length and one of their most popular albums, but is nonetheless guilty of every flaw that this band and their genre of clich\u00e9s is capable of.\n\nThis is straight up generic metalcore: the \u201cmetal\u201d being that abominable groove shit of the 90\u2019s that Pantera and Prong were pumping out, while the \u201ccore\u201d comes from that first wave of modern hardcore bands, like Throwdown and Earth Crisis. As with most metalcore bands, the obvious Swedish melodic death metal comparisons are applicable, but to call this stuff death metal is to deliver a kick to the crotch of anyone who\u2019s ever played in a death metal band. Lots of breakdowns reside in these songs, a few up-tempo \u201cthrash\u201d passages, plenty of tough guy screaming, more breakdowns, plenty of pilfered Diabolus-era Slayer riffs, a noticeable lack of actual guitar solos, and more fucking breakdowns. It is quite heavy throughout (there\u2019s one clean riff in the intro to \u201cRemorse is for the Dead\u201d), but that\u2019s a superficial benefit only to those that buy music to mindlessly headbang to. All riffs lead to breakdowns here, so that even when there\u2019s some rad exotic harmony riff or an actual fast fucking riff, it will inevitably descend into a patterned palm-muted purgatory from which few ever return. Many of the breakdowns feature lead melodies over them to hide the fact that they\u2019re generic breakdowns, while others feature one of the few solos of the album and still others don\u2019t even bother to try. Don\u2019t worry about the bass, you probably won\u2019t hear it. Only the drummer of this band is admirable, as he attempts to prog things up occasionally, but too often does he fail to bring the tempo up when need be, resulting in another prolonged groove passage when it could be a thrash one. \n\nAbove all else, it\u2019s the vocalist here who sucks the most. Roaring in a pseudo-death growl when there isn\u2019t some shitty spoken part, Randy Blythe follows thousands before him by failing to intimidate anyone. I\u2019m not sure why everyone prefers these hoarse vocals over melodic ones. Anybody can growl like this prick, but not just anyone can wail like Rob Halford or soar like Russell Allen. Lyrics are typical and repetitive, so expect to hear him roaring about the same things over and over again. \n\n\u201cLaid to Rest\u201d is the fan favorite on here as well as the least repugnant, but I think that\u2019s only because it\u2019s the first song. Every subsequent song follows in its stylistic footsteps, elevating repetitiveness to frustration. Fans of these guys will eat this shit up of course, though if there was one song that sucked worse than the rest it was \u201cOmerta.\u201d This song features a lengthy spoken intro (which is dumb in and of itself, especially when they do it live) before proceeding into some four minutes of grooving that never picks up. \n\nSpeaking of never picking up, don\u2019t pick up this album, unless of course you like below-average metalcore with far more emphasis on the \u201ccore\u201d than on the \u201cmetal.\u201d\n",
        "\nLamb of God is on the verge of becoming one of the biggest metal bands in the world. With the Killadelphia DVD, fans all over the world can find out what it's like being at an LOG show, and how life on the road is for them.\nTheir potential is unlimited and they can become one of the greatest bands of all time.\n\nKilladelphia features a full show at the Trocadero in Philadelphia. Intertwined between the live songs are features of the band members themselves living out their lives on the road. The disc is jampacked with so much content. This is enough to satisfy any fan.\n\nThe live portions cover all of their albums up to that point in time. It features classics such as 11th Hour, Ruin, Laid to Rest, Bloodletting from their Burn the Priest days, and of course Black Label. The set is very wellrounded, and is a great setlist. I guarantee that you will be headbanging your head into oblivion while watching LOG live.\n\nNow on to the on the road portion. There is alot of things on the dvd that will definitely make you laugh your head off. The guys do so many ridiculous and outrageous things. One of the highlights is when all the guys go skydiving off of a plane. Another highlight is when a couple of members of the band have an argument. The argument escalates into a full blown fight between the two. This really shows what they go through while touring on the road. I'm glad that the guys had the guts to put the fight on the dvd. \n\nAnother nice thing is the commentary. All the members of the band do commentary along with the director. They provide some insight as to what is happening while the dvd is playing. They also tell some funny behind the scenes jokes and will definitely make you crack up. There are also some videos by LOG which is a nice little treat. There are also some hidden easter eggs that are really nice as well, especially the one with a hooker involved.\n\nOverall, this is a killer live dvd with a bunch of extras. It is one of the best dvds ever. Killadelphia will not disappoint. This is Lamb of Fucking God at their very best and worst. I suggest that everyone buy this.\n",
        "\nThe 2006 release \u201cSacrament\u201d sees some change in Lamb of God, most notably the vocals. The music is more mainstream oriented but still manages to sound decent, there's even clean vocals thrown in here and there, sadly its nothing great though there is an improvement . But even with all the cons this album has its ups.\n\nThe album starts off with \u201cWalk With Me In Hell\u201d which is my favorite off this album. Has an amazing apocalyptic intro. Theres an interesting breakdown at 2:34, not your typical \u201cchugga chugga\u201d ones. Vocals are pretty good especially at the chorus when Randy goes into a high pitch scream, it should be noted that the vocalist does tend to go overboard which results in annoyance.\n\nAnother interesting track that caught my attention on first listen was \u201cDescending\u201d. Its a kind of track that sounds like it was composed for extensive airplay, yes a typical hit single, but it comes out as being a standout track on this album. I really liked the small segment at 2:23. Although I'm not a big fan of Randy's vocals in general I must admit that his vocals on this track are good. \n\nThe clean vocals are implemented well in \u201cAgain We Will Rise\u201d and \u201cPathetic\u201d. These two tracks are great has some good riffs but manages to get old after a couple of listens. Pathetic got a nice riff on its outro which happens after a short pause followed by a warping sound. Then there is also \u201cRedneck\u201d with its crappy chorus \u201cThis is a motherfucking invitation\u201d, sounds like something Fred Durst would come up with, also this song is supposed to be on George Bush which is really old seeing that Ministry released multiple fucking albums dedicated to it and Randy sounds a lot like Phil Anselmo on this track.\n\n\u201cBlacken the Cursed Sun\u201d and \u201cForgotten\u201d are tracks to look out for too. Forgotten has a nice short solo. \u201cRequiem\u201d and \u201cMore Time To Kill\u201d don't really stand out. The album closes with \u201cBeating on Deaths Door\u201d which includes some fast and intense drum work by Chris Adler. Theres a breakdown where Randy keeps repeating \u201cshes all yours now\u201d and its really brings the song down.\n\nThe biggest downside of this album has to be the vocals, there are times where he's at his best but there are times where he just sounds like hes clowning around. The Drumming is not the best out there but its definably the light of the album. Also due to the over production, the raw sound which was present in As the Palaces Burn and Ashes of the Wake is gone. If you liked LOG's earlier work then you may appreciate this album otherwise try sampling it first before purchase.\n\n\nRecommended: Walk With Me In Hell, Descending, Blacken The Cursed Sun, Beating On Deaths Door.\n",
        "\nWith the success of their heavy hitting debut album New American Gospel (not counting their first album under the name of Burn The Priest) and their classic sophomore album As The Palace Burns, Lamb Of God have established themselves as one of America's most popular death/ thrash bands of the 2000's. The purpose of this DVD, Terror And Hubris, is to allow fans to take a deeper look into the world of Lamb Of God. packed with 54 minutes worth of awesome live performances, music videos for two of Lamb Of God's most popular songs, a very interesting (and amusing) documentary with the band, and other extra goodies, this DVD makes a worthy piece to any Lamb Of God collection.\n\nThe documentary with the band is the main feature of the DVD, running at about 22 minutes. The feature starts off with clips from the live track In The Absence Of The Sacred, which sets the stage for more live track clips and commentaries throughout the documentary. The band also shows off a sense of sick humor, with their special segment called 'The Blair Shit Project', which is (as stated in 'warning' before the segment starts) meant to ensure the humility of person in which Randy Blythe takes the pleasure of humiliating (you'll have to see it to find out who and what they did).\n\nFollowing the segment and another live clip, the band talks about the events in the writing process of both the lyrics and music. There are also several clips of the band goofing off before, after, and during shows. They also have another segment which is a 'Making Of...' the music video for Ruin. After that is another interview with the band on how and why the band formed. As the credits role, you feel somewhat at a misdemeanor, because now, you you were to watch this documentary you would be completely left out in the cold if you consider Lamb Of God's Ashes Of The Wake to be your favorite album.\n\nTerror And Hubris contains several live videos of tracks from Lamb Of God's New American Gospel and As The Palace Burns releases. All the live tracks are typically the same, with Randy Blythe shirtless and sweating with his face blood red and his band mates rocking hard on a small stage with a bunch of fans head banging to their crushing music in some compact room or hallway. The live tracks are Ruin and 11th Hour, both from Lamb Of God's As The Palace Burns, and In The Absence Of The Sacred, The Subtle Arts Of Murder And Persuasion, Pariah, and Black Label all from Lamb Of God's New American Gospel. Although the live tracks are very fun to watch, they're is not a lot of variety in their concert acts and their performances.\n\nThe music video for Ruin, the better of the two, takes place inside a small church room asthe band performs in front of a bunch of despaired people in search of Christ. The band uses a lot of vague imagery to depict the religious aspect of what they stand for and at the same time express the intense emotions that drive the listeners to insanity. The video for Black Label is slightly more choppy then Ruin. In the video, they take a bunch of live performances that share the screen with segments focusing on what looks like a mental patient trying to escape the bondage prison in which he is in.\n\nThe extras include the documentary featured in audio or dolby digital sound, a music video for A Warning performed by a contest winner who submitted the video and won backstage passes to any Lamb Of God concert for life. Also in the extras is a DC commercial that featured Lamb Of God as the background music, and even has a 10 second introduction before the commercial is played. Overall, the DVD is pretty good... if you permanently live back in 2003 or early 2004. When compared to Lamb Of God's new DVD, Killidelphia, this DVD is nothing more then a teaser for fans who were waiting for th real thing.\n\nORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR SPUTNIKMUSIC.COM\n",
        "\nLet me start off by saying that I have tried, quite hard, to like this album. I bought it having had Lamb of God repeatedly recommended to me by a couple of friends, one in particular whose musical tastes I tend to agree with. I had heard a couple of songs by them, such as \u201cLaid to Rest\u201d and \u201cOmerta\u201d from Ashes of the Wake and they seemed pretty good. And so I flushed some cash down the proverbial pooper, by buying the reissue of this now well-known metalcore band\u2019s debut, New American Gospel. Now, I\u2019m not a big metalcore fan by any stretch of the imagination. I find that most metalcore bands have pretty unoriginal leanings in most departments: riffs, drums, vocals, lyrics, etc. But I\u2019ve also never been one to completely discount a genre based on a few bad experiences, and given the fact that this CD came so recommended, I thought I couldn\u2019t really go wrong with this one. Unfortunately for me, this proved not to be true. New American Gospel serves as little more than a dais from which one can vividly witness the malady that has plagued metalcore since its very foundation: mediocrity. \n\nWhen I first planted this CD in my stereo, my initial reaction was, well, satisfied. I wasn\u2019t floored by any means, but the impression I got from the first track, \u201cBlack Label\u201d, was a positive one. The song started off with a heavy riff, backed by some nice drum work. That can, in fact, pretty much sum up this song. I found that Randall Blythe\u2019s indecipherable shrieks didn\u2019t really add much, but they were tolerable (besides, it\u2019s not like the lyrics are well-written enough to be anything I really wanted to hear). I liked the palm-muted heaviness that this track had in spades, and I could easily see myself moshing to it live. It wasn\u2019t a bad start, so I was interested to see what else LOG had in store.\n\nRegrettably, they blew all their ideas on the opening track, because you know what? THE ENTIRE FUCKING ALBUM SOUNDS LIKE THAT. Yeah, that\u2019s right, for 41 minutes and 33 seconds (longer, if you bought the reissue, like me) you\u2019re force-fed the SAME GODDAMN PALM-MUTED RIFFS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. This album is like an exercise in auditory endurance. The CIA probably used this as a form of sonic torment on prisoners, imitating Chinese water-torture but on an aural level. After less than ten minutes you find yourself praying for a solo to save you from the sheer tedium, and one might blissfully appear for a span of two seconds, only to be cruelly snatched away long before you can appreciate it. No wonder Blythe was piss drunk when he recorded this, it was probably the only way he could cope with the intense ennui that this album provokes. As for the rest of the band, they must have been wearing some form of hearing protection or another, I can\u2019t think of any other way for them to have played such an intensely soul-draining exercise in boredom. Perhaps the only minor relief from this bleak expanse of uninspired drivel comes with the song \u201cTerror and Hubris in the House of Frank Pollard\u201d. Really the only thing that makes this track any different from the rest is the fact that it features something of an introductory solo, and that the producer sings, giving a much needed break from Blythe\u2019s insipid growling. Sure, it\u2019s still a pretty shitty track, but when you\u2019re dying of thirst in the Sahara, you take whatever source of moisture you can, be it an effervescent oasis, or a stinking, steaming wet pile of camel dung (sorry for that image, but it\u2019s a fitting metaphor for an album as appalling as this). Goddamn this is awful!\n\nBut hold on, we\u2019ve still yet to go through more cookie-cutter songs, like the \u201ckill me now\u201d agony that is \u201cPariah\u201d and let\u2019s not forget the fifty seconds of repetitive \u201cDUH-DUH-DUH-DUH- TING!\u201d, drumming that starts off \u201cConfessional\u201d before it bursts into another one of those relatively fast, but derivative, \u201chaven\u2019t I heard this before?\u201d riffs. And, of course, who can forget the finale, O.D.H.G.A.B.F.E., which supposedly stands for \u201cOfficer Dick Head Gets A Black Fucking Eye\u201d. Can you feel the creativity at work here? In the words of a million uneducated anti-authoritarian nimrods, \u201cFIGHT THA POWA DOOD!!!\u201d Aside from the pathetic excuse for a title, the song features equally clich\u00e9, pseudo-revolutionist lyrics (not that you\u2019ll be able to understand them, unless you actually go to the trouble of looking them up in the liner notes). And ya gotta love that final line, \u201cAuschwitz Kent State Chi-Town 68 Tiananmen Waco\u201d. Congratulations, Randy! You actually paid attention in history class! Too bad you failed English because you never could get proper grammar, syntax, or basic predicates! But here, I\u2019ll stuff a sucker in your gob if you\u2019ll just agree to close it for five goddamn minutes!\n\nAnd with that, we end this auditory abortion of an album (at least if you have the regular version). If you have the reissue, you might consider listening to the Japanese bonus track, as it possesses some odd, almost indefinable qualities that distinguish it from the rest of this tripe. Or perhaps it\u2019s simply the knowledge that I can comfortably turn my stereo off, knowing that I have endured all the unmitigated excrement that those who bought this album upon its initial release had to suffer through, and that now I can sympathize with those unfortunate people. Either way, it\u2019s over, and we hath endured. Congratulations if you actually managed to sit through the whole 40+ minutes of this garbage. You might find yourself stronger for it. Or traumatized. Whatever. Personally, I\u2019ll be fine knowing that this album will sit, gathering dust in my collection for many a year, perhaps forever, now that I have fulfilled my duty of listening to it one last time so that I might warn the uninitiated. Or perhaps I\u2019ll give it to one of my friends who likes the band. I can pretty much guarantee that they haven\u2019t heard this one, or they\u2019d be off Lamb of God faster than Rosie O\u2019Donnell off a diet.\n\nConclusion: When most people, or rather, those who are uneducated in anything but mainstream bands, talk about Lamb of God, they invariably say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re like, so heavy\u2026\u201d Yeah, they\u2019re heavy all right, but what the hell is that worth without any decent songwriting to back it up? I can write a \u201cheavy\u201d riff in a second, just using some basic palm-muted power chords, and if this album is any indication, this would seem to be the exact way this band writes all of their music. There is little room for originality, creativity, or actual coherence on this record. There is simply that which this band seems to worship above all else: the almighty HEAVINESS, to the exclusion of anything enjoyable. The songs on here might be bearable in small doses, but one cannot reasonably expect to go through an entire sitting of this and be actually engaged by the music. This album does little but fulfill the age-old stereotype that defines metal to the masses: it\u2019s really loud. And so, I can really only give you one simple word of advice, fellow metalhead: AVOID.\n",
        "\nLamb of God is one of those bands that has an era where solid records are made, musically, instrumentally and everything else. As soon as that happens and record companies acknowledge that they can make mainstream music and sell this type of music to the masses, they buy the band. Lamb of God SOLD OUT. Ashes of the Wake was still a solid album, so I thought I might give this a listen (despite having outgrown the Lamb Of God mainstream metal phase I had). \n\nThe first thing that I noticed was that the vocals were more vivid and uniquely thrashy/Pantera-ish. This of course, was NOT a good thing. It made the music softer and more like something you'd hear on MTV in my opinion, softer so that ears of individuals being introduced to metal for the first time can handle it. Another thing about Blythe (vocalist) is that he uses cliche swearing in the most obvious parts, i.e. \"This is a motherfucking invitation\". I think you could think of something better to say for a chorus... And this brings me to another problem, every bit of every lyric on this album is garbage. It's either about politics or hating someone, another perfect way to make money, bash on Bush. We know Bush isn't the brightest crayon in the box, but FUCK it's getting old.\n\nOn a lighter note, the musicianship (although lame and typical) is still solid, and Chris Addler kills the drums with his own unique style. The riffs are the same as the past 100 Lamb of God songs so I daresay it's kind of boring, no matter how technical or melodic they may be. HOWEVER, there is a solo in Walk With Me In Hell, which is something you usually don't see in pathetic Metalcore/Groove Metal bands.\n\nThe band made a video for \"Redneck\", and that was what really got on my nerves moreso than anything. It was a stereotypical MTV-friendly video that would be similar to the likes of any A7X or Bullet For My Valentine video, about a girl's birthday party that \"tuffxguys\" Lamb Of God comes to play at! Of course they have to come in the girl's backyard and crush her blowup pool, because that's what happens in every shitty video like this. All in all it just made me angry how they were on an RV with hot girls, because whatever \"metal\" was left in Lamb of God just got fucking Annihilated.\n\nI recommend this band to all the pussy hot topic kids, and dudes that like to paint their nails black and wear eyeliner, subsequently listening to Slipknot.\n",
        "\nLamb of God has stormed the American Metal Scene in the last few years \u2013 much to metal elitists dislikes. Their interesting blend of thrash, death, and groove has taken most metal fans by shock and lead the band to become one of the most recognizable touring names in the United States. Sacrament is the culmination of their reach to become one of the most sought after metal bands in the world.\n\nSacrament is not the usual Lamb of God that most fans are going to expect. There style that was present on the last album, Ashes of the Wake, is not completely gone but it is definitely more thought out and manipulated. They have really incorporated a variable to the fold, one of a bit of melody and pushing more towards a musical approach to their style rather than a raw energy driven approach. I\u2019m not saying that the music is by any means not fast, heavy, or flat \u2013 but when listening to Sacrament, one can tell they spent a little more time in the composing part of the album process. Mark Morton and Willie Adler add more complexity to the mix along with a focus on the lead guitar as opposed to the focus of rhythm on Ashes of the Wake. The guitars are definitely a dominating force on the album and Chris Adler\u2019s drumming is nonstop professional grade playing. The music is heavy and full of groove \u2013 but Sacrament is also more focused on varying melodies and lead guitar parts. There are even a few songs on the able where parts are almost reminiscent of Pantera (I wouldn\u2019t go as far to say they sound like Pantera). For me, this throwback to As the Palaces Burn is an excellent path for Lamb of God to head down. Now, with a Grammy Nomination, I hope the band continues down this way of thinking for their musical writing.\n\nThe most notable change for Lamb of God as compared to their previous efforts is in fact what I believe to be their weakest link \u2013 the vocals. Where originally the vocals were \u201cpig squeal-esque\u201d and later when they seemed very monotonous, Sacrament presents us with a progressive sound from Randy Blythe. He varies the sound of his guttural presentation to involve a little bit of everything and even a little more (thanks to producer Machine) and it finally adds a layer that Lamb of God have been missing. Blythe whispers screams and even does a pretty descent thrash voice on the last song. Also something I think Blythe did right this time around is to avoid writing the lyrics politically. Nothing dates a song faster than political messages - unless they are cleverly written. The lyrics focus more on personal issues and demons rather than worldly ones. \n\nOverall, Lamb of God have come a long way from being a bar band to being one of the most popular bands. They haven\u2019t reached the potential I believe they have, but Sacrament is getting closer. There is a lot of room for improvement still but if they continue on the road Sacrament is pointing to then they will have earned the right to be one of the most popular metal bands in the United States.\n\nSongs to check out: Walk with Me in Hell, Redneck, Beating on Death\u2019s Door.\n",
        "\nThis album really disappointed me. I bought Sacrament first and thought to myself \"Wow, now I know why Townsend had a go with these guys. This stuff is awesome!\". So, after hearing a hype about this particular album, I picked it up and popped it in the cd player.\n\nThe first song \"Ruin\", sounded like a typical lamb of god song, great start, nice thrashy riff to get into it. Near the end, an awesome thrashy part comes in when everything speeds up. It was at this point that this whole album fell to pieces. After Ruin, everything sounds pretty much exactly the same. Same tempos, same key, same riffs with one or two notes changed slightly, or a random bend in it.\n\nI was confused! Devin Townsend helped produce this album. Devin Townsend LIKES this album. What in gods name is going on!? Dev is famous for his super slick production on his music, from Ocean Machine onward, and I for one am a large fan. But this just takes the piss. I can't even begin to understand why someone so solid and knowledgable in music would decide to shittily produce large, repetetive piles of shit from the earlier staged gaping shithole that was lamb of god.\n\nAfter the first 4 songs, I started skipping songs once I got bored of them. The rest of the album then summed up to about four minutes by doing this. Seriously, if you've heard Sacrament and like it, don't go back from it, this stuff is lamb of god in an era of time where they have no ability to make anything but one song over and over again. It's a large giveaway since most of the songs are in 3/4 and the ones that are in 4/4 sound like they should be in 3/4. People will argue and say \"NOE!1 RUIN IZ IN 12/8 U DUM AZZ!1!!1\" when 12/8 is pretty much 3/4, just with longer bars. It makes no different of it's 6/4, 6/8, 12/4, 3/8 or whatever, it's still the same beat, which - in turn - is repeated throughout the album. Not that I have something against 3/4 time signatures, but when they're used over and over again in the same style that these guys do, it's just tedious.\n\nThe reason I actually gave this album a few marks was for one reason, Chris Adler. If it was a whole drums album, I'd give it better marks. The drums on this album are absolutely superb and sound great. Townsend also gets marks here for this production. The snare power on this is mighty and the kick drums slam away and add some real power to the guitars, even if the guitars have no power and weight on their own. It's Adler that keeps this album partially alive, luckily enough.\n\nThe whole band (except Randy) are pretty talented. I can't argue that Willie Adler isn't a good guitarist. The solo on \"Purified\" is exceptional. I can hear a vague Meshuggah influence in this solo, particularly from Stengah's solo off the Nothing album. A lot of whammy bar usage and legato. The bass is another issue I have with the album though, which I will discuss next.\n\nThe bass is just not there at all. In Ruin, you can hear a nice solid bassline along with the guitars and it makes a good pillar to place the guitars on top of.Come the next track, where's it gone? Has it been pushed back in the mix like the vocals? All I hear are the airy sounding, bad produced guitars that sound as though they were recorded outside on a windy day. Maybe the bass could've saved this album a bit more, but it's left me thinking that the bassist snapped his strings halway through Ruin and didn't have enough time to run to the shop and get some more. The volume of everything is yet again another issue I have with this band. The guitars are far too loud in the mix, and had they been turned down, this album would be so much more listenable as well as the vocals being heard properly and the bass existing.\n\nEither way, I didn't enjoy this album, and if your metal standards are high, then don't bother with this album, it's nothing special, and neither are lamb of gods writing abilites. They're just a band with lots of potential but nothing to do with it.\n",
        "\nI bought this album due to all the hype I heard from various sources. It's even been referred to as \"Death metal\". The problem is that this album isn't what's it's hyped up to be. I bought the 'remastered' version and on the inlay there's a speech about how poor the conditions were in recording this record: Randy was drunk the whole time, they only had a very short time-frame to record, and Randy had to do the vocals in like 1 session. All of this adds up to mostly negatives with very little positives.\n\n\nThe vocals are absolutely terrible. On \"Black Label\" the lead singer [Randy] isn't even saying anything audible except 5 words IF you listen very closely with the lyrics in hand. It doesn't help when isn't even saying the correct words on \"A Warning\": \"I'll suck you down and drag you dry!\", but on the demo he says what the lyrics say; \"I'll drag you down and suck you dry!\" I can see some slurring due to his apparent alchohol consumption, but these lyrics are really bad. Most songs require to have the lyrics close by, and even still you're only gonna make out half of the lyrics IF you're listening intently.\n\n\nThe guitars and drums on here are saves the album from being totally lost. They are pretty heavy, and prove that this album is more crushing then their later Groove metal albums. Unfortunately, 'crushing' isn't enough to salvage this album. The drums sometimes are so loud that they make a popping noise even on low volume levels, and the guitars aren't anything spectacular compared to current-day Metalcore bands. It's basically crushing music, but mediocre at the same time. Strong but normal I suppose. \n\n\nI reccomend this album to anybody who is a really dedicated fan of Lamb of God. Otherwise, steer clear of this one and don't fall into the hype. As most albums go, buy the opposite of what people tell you. If you don't give a shit about lyrics, then maybe you'll enjoy this one, but most of the music just isn't really spectacularly different from any other Metalcore album.\n",
        "\nAlright, what do we have here? The new hope of American heavy metal! Hmm, are they really? Let\u2019s see\u2026\n\nSo there I am at home eager to listen to this album from \u201cLamb of God\u201d, the so frequently cited by magazines and internet websites as the new hope of the genre. And so I spend the next 40 minutes or so for a quality listen. I do the same again and again for the following days. And here\u2019s what I came to after these long listens:\n\nEither there is something wrong with my stereo or this album has no bass frequency what so ever??? What happened to this fellow sitting on the right side of the couch??? (It\u2019s the bassist sitting over there in the band picture in the album). \n\nWhat about that production? They say that Devin Townsend is quite a producer. Really huh? Well, somebody please let me know when he produces another album so that I don\u2019t buy it by mistake! \n\nWhat about song writing someone would reasonably ask? And that\u2019s the right thing to do since the production and sound of the end-result are less important than the actual compositions that sit on an album. \n\nSome of the songs here are killer. Yes they are. But the problem in this case is that there aren\u2019t really 10 songs on this one as one can see on the album back cover. It\u2019s basically one big song here. All the songs are so alike, it\u2019s hard to believe! They share the same type of writing and structure. The riffs are slightly different; few main riffs and many small variations of them. So what? Somebody will say. This isn\u2019t progressive or some shit. Well, I happen to have high standards for my heavy listens and I\u2019m not done with my problem list yet anyway.\n\nThe thing is that there is another problem and this is definitely a \u201clast but not least\u201d kind of situation around this one, because it\u2019s simply huge. This Randy Blythe shouldn\u2019t sing. This guy does not have a voice. He is pretending and we all know that in studio there is nothing that you cannot make happen nowadays. So really now, he does not convince me\u2026 not one bit he doesn\u2019t. You want a death metal voice, try Tardy \u2013 (\u201cObituary\u201d), or Lindberg \u2013 (\u201cAt the Gates\u201d, \u201cNightrage\u201d), or Akerfeldt \u2013 (\u201cOpeth\u201d). Blythe is just a low lever singer.\n\nAll in all, I see no genius here. Hell, I don\u2019t even see above average stuff. I see filler material with few solid songs to make an album. I hear riffs I have heard before. I\u2019m hearing sections and parts that I\u2019m already familiar with without having to listen to these guys. This release is only recommended to the hardcore fans of this band and to none other\u2026 enough said.\n",
        "\nRight from the get-go effectual and eerie inhabitant riffing of Walk With Me In Hell - with its tried and true testament to speed metal, and hatred neck breaking blasts, beating on death's door; directly to the reign in blood junk key drumming and Sacred Reich laid to restless guitar grist, imbalanced by a hostile, vehement vocal entourage - America's #1 thrash metal pioneers prevail, purified with their most passionate sacrificial offering to date. Descending like a cynic who has been bleeding the blood of the scribe, into the depths of death, with more time to kill; again, triumphantly Lamb Of God rise from the ashes of the wake, while watching the pathetic poseurs' palaces burn. \n\nThis sacrament - this oath of allegiance - is technical and riddled with time changes. Drummer driven Chris Adler is phenomenal! He borrows brutally and meticulously from Dave Lombardo, Paul Bostaph, and Gene Hoglan; then expands their subtle intricacies, to create his own manic method. He is definitely the best American drumming flaying skins today. Guitar temerity team Willie Adler, brother to Chris, and metal mastermind Mark Morton, mix blues laden hooks with undulating guitar gripping anthems to create a paradigm and poise, unmatched. Even Chuck Shuldiner would bow in deference, with diligence. This requiem resounds when Randall blithely blears with his gut wrenching vocal vitriol. Overbearing, yet prolific producer, the proto metal - Machine, made Randall really work to achieve a sound unlike any he had previously attained. He even compelled him to run around the block to the point of exhaustion, just to return to the studio and nail that last take. Randall reaps the Phil Anselmo aggressive antics while laying low like Chuck Billy; still his unique foot to the throat threnody vocals are quite discernible, and seldom forgotten. This line-up would not be complete with out the poker faced snare of bucolic bassist - Mr. John Campbell, and his cunning wit.\n\nFor your malice and ruin - each song on this sacred sacrament speaks for itself; showing identity and integrity with probing poignant personality. This time evading any political intrigue, or anti-war protest; the subject matter is more personal and appropriate. Mark Morton is a lyrical lycan, sinking his teeth into the heart of the matter in such delectible diatribes. Randy realizes this anguish and upset, and the audience is drawn right into the pit and pendulum. Cuts like Redneck with it's validation video pan; Black Sun, or Time To Kill create constant apathy; whereas, Forgotten (Lost Angels) conveys their contempt for L.A.; no doubt, eluding to the club who would not book them, solely based on their former namesake - Burn The Priest. Songs like these and other primal pieces evoke such bile and bitter taste.\n\nIt took several revolutions for me to engage in this conflict and struggle. Once I tuned everything out and absorbed the melodies, the music became etched into my gut, and seared into my skull. After reading the lyrics, I was initiated into the last rites and holy disorder. The limited edition CD also comes with a three song live bonus disc; but it is also accompanied by a bonus 90 minute DVD deliniating the rigour and wrangle the band underwent in the studio to create such an act of contrition and communion. They were baptised by the blistering blade of belief. There are also sketches for each members side-projects and personal hobbies. Mark likes to drag race and win; John is a competitive card player; Willie is a wonderful cook and focuses on his wife and son; Randy loves chili cook-offs; and Chris' concern is the band and his drumming destiny. There is also the aforementioned video for Redneck or a studio montage rendition - your choice. Metalheads, it's time to shatter the hourglass and discover the sacred lamb's offering; for now you've got something to strive for!\n\nas originally posted at www.metalcovenant.com\n",
        "\nLamb of God's \"As the Palaces Burn\" is probably their best material so far. I started listening to this album with pretty low expectations, but it really surprised me for the best.\n\n\"As The Palaces Burn\" maybe short, but it does what it's here for. The album is many times drum driven, and many times the guitar simply follows the double bass pedals. But this is just half of the time, and the other half is outstanding riffs which i did not expect from Lamb of God. The riffs are a fine combination of heaviness and melody, and this album is mostly credited for its riffs.\n\nOther than that, several solos are featured, but besides the one in \"Purified\" and \"Blood Junkie\", they are not all that. Bassist John Campbell does a great job in my opinion, and production makes sure it is heard and emphasizes its importance. In more production matters, it sounds too mechanic. Other than the bass, the drums sound too much of a background, and the double bass were given an even lower tone. The guitar lacks a bit groove that goes so well with the drumming.\n\nAs I said, there are a lot of drum driven parts. in fact, most of the songs are written half guitar riffs and half drum riffs, all of which are excellent. You don't always notice the drum-driven ones as such because of the production, but they are there, with both double bass and regular drumming.\n\nAt general view, \"As The Palaces Burn\" is a great album. My personal favorites: \"As The Palaces Burn\", \"11th Hour\", \"A Devil In God's Country\", \"In Defense of Our Good Name\". Excellent riffing and technique. I gave it only 92 for two reasons: The solos and the production. Other than that - go and get it.\n",
        "\nOh Lamb of God, the modern day Pantera some say, the new Slayer others say. The kids love it and I get it, but this is far from being anything innovative or groundbreaking. Sacrament is the band's attempt to mature and grow, and while it may have happened, the result is pretty boring.\n\nThis is a very dark and introspective view of Lamb of God. I don't think they will ever release another album quite like this one. From the music to the lyrical content, the attitude is a very somber one that almost lends atmospheric qualities to the listening experience. So points go to that since they have set a tone for the record.\n\nThe biggest difference is in the vocals, since the rest of the band hasn't changed anything at all. Randy Blythe kind of \"sings\" on this record I guess. He has added a melodic touch to his usual bark. Think of a much less talented Devin Townsend and you'll get the approach.\n\nThe riffs and the overall structure of the songs are exactly the same as Ashes of the Wake, it's just darker. However where Ashes had some good songs that really pounded on occasion, this record has much less of that. Lamb of God added melody to their sound, they just didn't do it very well. So expect a lot of random twists in the riffs, like on Ashes only with more leads and melodic breaks. The bass is once again nonexistent in the mix and Chris Adler delivers a fine performance behind the kit. Once again he is by far the band's strongest member.\n\nOnto the actual songs. I must say the first two tracks are very boring. \"Walk With Me In Hell\" never picks up at all, rather hovers at around 120 bpm during its entirety resulting in Z's all around. \"Again We Will Rise\" is not much better with uninspiring riffs and vocal attacks. However one of my favorites is ''Descending'', a song with a very new flavor to the band. It's slower and Blythe really spills his guts out in the vocal department. ''Blacken the Cursed Sun'' has a jolting rythm section which is perfectly complemented by the vocals. ''Forgotten'' is also a choc-full of riffs with some pretty tech-filled passages, especially in the drum department. \n\nThe album closer also rips. ''Beating On Death's Door'' ends the record in style, and differently than on the last couple of records, where the closer would start of with a clean part. This one just rocks from head to toe and once again showcases Chris Adler's chops on the drumkit. I must give it to Lamb of God, they almost always finish their records on a high point.\n\nSo there you go, an attempt at growing which was stunted by style which is becoming all too predictable and stagnant. This isn't terrible or anything, but it does not deserve incredible praise. Watch the DVD though and you may have an easier time getting into it.\n",
        "\nLamb of god has done a really good job on this album and has been a good improvement for Ashes Of Wake. This time around they went for a more Pantera feel and a stronger groove/thrash metal sound. From the first to last track this album never fails to bore me. First track is \"Walk with me in Hell\" great opening track, the begining of the song the guitars are really erie uplifting kind of sound and sounds pretty awsome, this song has a pretty good riff and feel throughout the song and finally a solo and a quite good one at that, the track aslo has a pretty angry/sad epic kind of feel but a great song. Another song that really caught my attention is redneck, the single for this album and also has a party type good feel, and good vocals. \n\nThe vocals on this album are a highlight where Randall Blythe has nice clean yet screaming vocals and you can pretty well make out wat he is saying throughout most of the songs. The instrumentals in this album I liked very much, the guitars have lots of good riffs and some occuring solos which is a nice touch such as in \"walk with me in hell\" and \"decending\". Also the drumming was very good in this album with lotsa nice beats and good drumming along to the riffs which adds to the whole sound. In all a solid well rounded metal album and good one to headbang your head off to\n\nIf you are a fan of lamb of god you should really pick up this album and give it a listen I garentuee you will enjoy it very much. Even if your not a fan of Lamb of God still give this album a listen, you will probally enjoy it.\n",
        "\nIt's too early to say how this will stand up to LoG's other 3 major releases, because like all of Lamb of God's back catalog, this album has a distinct sound all its own.\n\nLamb of God have never been one to be content with their current sound and keep running with it. The transition from New American Gospel to As the Palaces Burn was a noticable one, and even to Ashes of the Wake there were many different elements incorporated. Sacrament follows this trend and delivers a great and consistent album with a much different approach and vibe than any of their previous releases, but managing to still sound like Lamb of God.\n\nThe first thing you'll think when you pop this in is 'epic,' or 'grandiose.' Layers and layers constitute the lavish production that brings this record to life. The drums sound better, the bass sounds better, and the guitars sound BIGGER. Randy's voice, besides some melodic leanings (I never thought I'd see the day), is pretty much like it was before, although with more reverb/delay/various effects than before. Bottom line, this is the best sounding record Lamb of God has done.\n\nNow, the most important part, the music. Despite what you may have thought about Redneck (it seemed like Lamb of God became a Pantera meets thrash band), forget about it. There's a lot going on in this album that displays LoG at their most experimental yet, and even their fastest yet. \n\nWalk With Me In Hell is purely epic in nature and kicks the album off much like the looming feeling South of Heaven started off a classic Slayer album. And what's that? A solo??? Yes, solos are abound in this album, which is AWESOME in my opinion, because Mark Morton is damn good at it and maybe people will stop talking about Jon Donais all the time, who in my opinion is good but WAY overrated. Again We Rise, along with a great deal of this album, is quite a thrashy number with some killer breakdowns and a spacey guitar line weaving in and out at certain points. Chris Adler is on FIRE on this album, he definitely shows what he's got. Descending mixes it up with a fairly simple riff that leaves a lot of room for Randy's vocals to shine, and becomes one of the more memorable tracks on the album. Blacken the Cursed Sun is another epic in the vein of the opening track with some of the sickest vocals I've ever heard from Randy (Begging on your KNEEEEEES....) towards the end of the song. The closing track sounds old school as FUCK (as a matter of fact, LoG just wanted to write a tune that sonded like old Exodus, and originally the title was called Old School) and is just plain fun violent thrash.\n\nSo...bottom line-best production ever for LoG, everybody in the band stepping it up a notch, more thrash/epicness/variation/SOLOS, slightly more linear song structures. And, quite honestly, I've never heard a record that sounds quite like this before. There's a vibe here that's quite unique.\n\nAs I said before, it's hard to say where this stands in the hierarchy of LoG albums right now, but I would be willing to say that this is a great and logical step in their evolution. At least they didn't puss out like Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage did.\n",
        "\nI'm all for long reviews, but this album doesn't really warrant one. It's pretty straightforward - Lamb of God doing what Lamb of God does (a sort of Pantera-esque groove/half-thrash with some death and metalcore elements), and no matter what you think of them, this album is not going to change your opinion much. Sure there are a few differences, mostly in the vocals (Randy takes the band's Pantera worship up a notch by adding some very Anselmo-like semiclean vocals here and there), but on the whole they haven't moved too far away from the sound of their last two albums.\n\nBottom line is this: Sacament is more of the same from this band. If you like Ashes of the Wake and don't mind hearing the same sort of thing again, go ahead and pick this one up. It's alot of fun, and definitely worth your money. If you're not a fan of this band, or prefer their earliest work, then pass on this because it's not going to win you over. I gave it an 80 because I happen to like this band, and Sacrament does not disappoint.\n",
        "\nOriginally written for The Riff Repository (http://riffrepository.awardspace.com/)\n\nAs of late, Lamb of God have been receiving lots of accolades and have become one of the darling children of the modern extreme metal scene. At first, I thought it was a lot of hype. I didn't particularly care for the raw production and banshee-like screams of Randy Blythe on my casual listens to the New American Gospel. As the Palaces Burn was a slightly better experience, with improved vocal work.\n\nAnd then I listened to Ashes of the Wake.\n\nAlthough they have been dubbed part of the \"New Wave of American Heavy Metal\", which seems to have exclusively metalcore connotations to it, Lamb of God pick up where Pantera left off with a very groove-heavy take on thrash. While many people will claim that Ashes of the Wake offers little from it's predecessor and in fact claim that LoG are showing signs of losing what makes them original, I beg to differ. Metal elitists need to get off of their high horses and admit that just because music becomes more palatable to the ear does not necessarily mean a loss of heaviness or indicate signs of sell-outage. Quite the contrary.\n\nThe first two things that stood out at me about this album from it's predecessors made it single-handedly my favorite Lamb of God album and the album that got me into the band: top-notch production and a considerably more refined vocal style. Unlike on the previous albums, which features a somewhat muddied, soft, and \"tinny\" production, this album is possibly one of the best-produced metal albums this side of prog. metal. Everything is mixed extremely well with the dry, crunchy guitars being hammered in place by the distinctive ride cymbal bell and snare and bass drums. As well, on this record, Randy Blythe really shows evolution as an actual singer. Rather than using an exclusively unintelligible banshee squeal as on the prior works, Bltyhe opts for a more discernable, raspy singing approach. Some of the old shrieks, growls, and screams make cameos, but they now act more effectively as accents.\n\nAnd the music? Fuck, this album never lets up with the infectious, dry, palm-muted riffs of guitarists Willie Adler and Mark Morton. There's little else that can be said other than the riffage on this record never lets up. You can't help but bang your head to the \"chunk-chunk-chunk\" on basically every track. However, while the riffing makes every song extremely solid and consistent, it also does little to distinguish one song from the other. Added to the fact that conventional leads and guitar solos are few and far between, this proves to be Ashes's weakness as well as its strength. Sure, their are standout tracks like \"Laid to Rest\", \"Omerta\" (both of which have spoken-verse intros), and \"The Faded Line\", it sometimes becomes difficult to really remember certain songs. Don't get me wrong; the guitarists of Lamb of God are extremely talented and, like the rest of the band, extremely tight. However, this album would've received an 100% on musicianship if their was a bit more lead-work.\n\nMost of the time, I find metal drummers to be more or less the same. They're all pretty much \"competent\" musicians, but few stand out from the pack to me to the point where I really appreciate their work (Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater comes to mind). Chris Adler is one of those drummers I was talking about - much more than just \"competent\" and actually creative. His work on Ashes (and previous albums) is superb. Yes, the man uses and incredible amount of double bass, but to good effect. Instead of doing the traditional death/thrash patterns or hardcore breakdowns, Adler goes out of his way to mix up the bass drum patterns, adding syncopation and weaving in and around the guitars. At no point is the drumming overbearing - blast beats being an extremely rare occurrence. Chris' playing is incredibly smooth and tight; almost machine-like. If the riffs are like a sheet of metal, Chris' drumming is the nails that hammer it down.\n\nIs this album innovative? No, not particularly. Is this album enjoyable and heavy-as-fuck? Oh yes. The band is extremely tight and remains an extreme metal band, but have taken huge strides in making their music both heavy and catchy at the same time. There are few albums that I can listen to over and over again from start to finish without skipping a track. Can I remember many of the tracks from the rest? No, not especially. Is every track consistent and solid? Most definitely. Ashes of the Wake is an incredibly catchy hybrid of groove and thrashyness. Highly recommended.\n",
        "\nThere are a few things going on about Ashes of the Wake:\nEpic Records released a DualDisc, with the album on one and the DVD with better sound quality and extra songs on the other side. Some Ashes of the Wake albums include a bonus CD with songs from other albums, and there are two versions available of Ashes of the Wake, one clean, one explicit. So you have identical named songs on identical named albums, but they sound different from each other.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard many bands using riffs as chords, and I can\u2019t recall the last time I heard someone play riffs at the speed L.O.G can play. Melody\u2019s are unnecessary, the only thing the guitar players need are the riffs. In that way, they\u2019re very original. And they\u2019re predictable. If you hear a riff once, you can sing it along with the music, but it isn\u2019t nuisant. The riffs are incredibly well-thought and very good played. The fact that they\u2019re predictable, doesn\u2019t spoil the fun of listening to it.\n\nThe songs are well-composed, using small and tiny techniques that make a song very good, but that are not so much heard in other bands/songs. The guitar duals are really good, and the voice of Randall Blythe fits in very well.\n\nThe production is well-balanced. You can hear all the instruments clearly, and the riffs have a good volume. The clean version of the CD has a slight distortion, so that it sounds a bit raw, but still clear. The explicit version differs very much as the distortion is much more present. But it still sounds good. Both of the versions don\u2019t have that pushing: they create a bit of a gap between you and the music.\n\nThe songs are all on-beat. You never have the feeling that the music is slowing down a bit on a difficult riff, or that the music starts too soon after a break, or too late. Lamb of God doesn\u2019t play acoustical parts or parts that meant to be sad or something, on the contrary, the songs all sound aggressive and mean. It definitely fits with the riffs and vocals and stuff.\n\nJust like every album: this album also has some songs/parts that deserve a note:\n-\tHourglass sounds different from the other songs on the album. The alternations are quicker, there are more parts in the song, and they all differ from each other a bit to much. This song definitely needs a while to get used to, but it is acceptable.\n-\tLaid to Rest is a very good opener for the album. This song sounds just meaner than every other song on the album. The riff at the middle of the song is truly fantastic.\n-\tNow You\u2019ve Got Something To Die For has a beautiful intro.\n-\tThe solo\u2019s of One Gun are good\n-\tThe song Ashes of the Wake has a very good intro, and besides some speeches of Blythe, the song\u2019s instrumental.\n-\tRemorse is for the Dead also has a beautiful opening riff.\n\nIf you run across this album: buy it! And if you want the best version, I suggest you\u2019d buy the explicit version (if you can find one, there\u2019s no difference in the cover artwork as far as I know). This is a very good album for the ultimate party moments of your life, headbanging\u2019s guaranteed! The album sounds very, very good. It\u2019s a must have for every riff-fanatic, every explicit-production-fanatic, and everyone who loves mean and aggressive songs.\n",
        "\nThis DVD is probably, along with Killswitch Engage's Set this Worl Ablaze, is the one I've seen so far that really seems to capture the essence of the band. After watching this footage, you feel as though you know the band personally. \n\nThe way the main feature was edited has bits of life on the road between live footage of Lamb of God in Philadelphia, and to me it's the \"behind the scenes\" stuff that is the most interesting. This comprises itself of the viewer following the band on tour in the states and in the UK. There are many highs, such as pranks pulled on the bus as well as the band members interacting with fans and themselves. There are little features about every band member as well as the crew that really have a \"true\" factor to them. This DVD is pretty void of bullshit. \n\nAs for the live footage, it's absolutely killer. The production is very good and the sound is captured extremely well. As for the performance, I've already reviewed the CD and the band absolutely shreds, with Randy Blythe truly showing off his vocal prowess. The band is super tight and the setlist has just about all the fan favorites you could ask for in a headlining show. It's heavy and it's intense. Check out \"Ruin\" and \"Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion\" to really see what their live show is all about. \n\nHowever, as I previously stated, it's getting to know the band as well as you do that really gets me stoked to watch this over and over again. You see the dudes actually fight when they're in Glascow(and I mean an actual fist fight!), and you see them have the time of their lives parachuting and hanging out with the likes of Children of Bodom. The feature also seems to really capture the life on the road, as you their bus break down a couple of times as well as other unfortunate events that happen. \n\nThe live footage kills, the behind the scenes stuff is even better. All in all this video has a lot of content and I for one ind it to be easy to watch repeatedly. If you're a fan of the band ytou should definitely check this out.\n",
        "\nLamb of God have set the bar pretty high for themselves upon the expectations for this release. They had to prove that they were not selling out despite being signed to a major label. I must commend them on the fact that they did not mess around with their sound so much as to alienate fans, however, this is not their best release.\n\nThe production is amazing and it is clear on this record that the band is tighter than ever before and are playing more technical songs than they ever have. Many tracks have very weird and interesting note selections as far as the guitar is concerned. The vocals are absolutely amazing. This is Randy`s best studio performance by a longshot. The drums as usual are technical yet match the guitar work perfectly. What makes this album a little less exciting is the lack of variety within the tracks.\n\nThis album kicks off with some of the band's best material. The first five tracks are amazing.''Laid to Rest'' kicks things off with a bang. Some very cool and strange riffs are accompanied by some fancy drum work courtesy of Chris Adler. '' Hourglass'' is to me the best track on the record. This song has nice tempo variations, very interesting riffs and vocal patterns.''Now You've Got Something to Die For'', ''The Faded Line'' and ''Omerta'' all have their share of moments and would be considered classics by now. \n\nHowever there is a batch of forgettable tunes on this release. ''Blood of the Scribe'',''One Gun'' and ''Break You'' are not bad songs at all, they just don't match the power and the energy of the first four or five tracks. \n\nHowever, as on ASTP, the album closer is well worth the wait.''Remorse is for the Dead'' starts off kind of like ''Vigil'' from the previous record did, with a clean intro until all hell breaks loose and you're caught in a flurry of violent riffs, intense drumming and powerful vocals. The lyrics are also quite good as they deal with a steady amount of violence and describe a hate filled situation of having to destroy your enemy. \n\nThis is not a bad album at all, if you want a straight up dose of heavy riffs with a good backbone and energy, I would recomment this to you. However this is little to nothing experimental or risky here, just a slab of modern day American metal.\n",
        "\nAs the Palaces Burn, the second release from Virginia's Lamb of God is not bad per say, just not very original. \n\nNew American Gospel was quite good, with technical riffing and solid rythm playing and a truly different vocal style from Randy Blythe. This record is basically a watered down version of Gospel. It's still pretty good, but nothing here besides a few tracks will really blow you away.\n\nFor one the guitar playing gets pretty repetitive. Triplets dominate the sonic landscape and groove/Pantera worship parts abound. The tone is quite dry and the bass is inaudible. Randy Blythe also changed his approach. While maybe not as unique as before, he is much clearer and has a more devastating tone to his voice. However respect goes out to Chris Adler who truly does add flavor and diversity to what would otherwise be some rather mundane songs at times. Unfortunately the production is rather lackluster and the band suffers from it.\n\nThat being said there are some very good songs here. \"Ruin\", the opener is a fistful of energy with headbanging material and a killer main riff. However towards the end they slow it down to a snail's pace, luckily not long enough to ruin it (pardon the pun). The title track is also very good, short and sweet. The \"My redemption lies in your demise\" is definitely a noteworthy moment and the band scores points. After that \"11th Hour\" has some catchy bits, but nothing groundbreaking. \"Devil In God's Country\" is also pretty good.\n\nThe band saved their best track for last. \"Vigil\" starts off slow but once you hit the midpoint it unleashes into a true headbanging delight. The rythm section, and specifically Chris Adler's playing, gives the song new life and closes the record out with a bang. \n\nExodus or Dark Angel this is not. But if you want groovy and straight-forward american metal with the odd breakdown, you should be able to enjoy this.\n",
        "\nLamb of God have been gleaming in the spotlight for the last couple of years. Many dismiss them for their popularity, but this is a pretty damn good metal band. They prove it with this live release.\n\nThe obvious difference between this and their studio recordings is the intensity level. Tracks such as Ruin and The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion kick you even harder here than they do on the albums.\n\nRandy Blythe delivers an awesome performance here. His vocal ranges from shrieking highs to death metal growls. His stage persona seems to be quite remarkable as he seems to hold the crowd in the palm of his hand.\n\nMusically, the band is very tight. Some of the starts and stops these guys pull off are quite impressive, and the tempos seem to fluctuate pretty closely to the original versions of these songs. Chris Adler is on top of his game behind the kit as are his brother Willie and Mark Morton at their respective guitar spots. The only flaw may be that we don't hear enough bass in the mix, but the sound is very good nonetheless.\n\n Standout tracks are Laid to Rest and Hourglass from the new record, Pariah also comes out strong along with As the Palaces Burn and Black Label ,the closing track to the setlist.\n\nA very strong and very impressive release to say the least. Live intensity to the max.\n",
        "\nThat is all this album is. 1 song, 11 different titles. \n\nI was intrigued about all the hype about this. People were calling this fast, heavy as hell, and incredibly technical. Unfortunately, when I gave this a listen, I found that this album really isn't any of those. Sure, songs are heavy and moderately fast, but technical? Not at all. These guys can palm mute, and they do it for the entire duration of the album.\n\nThe album kicks off promisingly. In the beginning I was rather impressed with their unique style of playing. Unfortunately, the album went on, and every song sounded identical to the last. Each one was chugging and screaming with no soloing and really no means of variation. The title track is one of the only songs with soloing, and consequently is really the only one that sticks out. All the other songs are a few minutes of the lame \"chugga-chugga\" riffing that we've heard from the five songs before it. It's obvious that these guys have musical talent. Their drummer sounded good, and the guitar was sweet when they decided to actually do something. Unfortunately, they chose not to use it, and opted to stay with one set formula throughout the entire album.\n\nI have no problem with the genre debate over them. These guys are metal, plain and simple, nothing -core about them. What kills me is that this is what is becoming popular in the metal scene. People who don't know much about metal will here this before anything decent and assume that this is what metal is. I must say this frightens me. Metal has so many variations and opportunities it's incredible. Why these guys chose to replicate one song and dub it an album is beyond me. Had they crafted 11 completely different songs, I think I would like this. The first song I hear I like it, the second I like it even more, but by the third I'm just waiting for something new. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver.\n",
        "\nAh, after \u201cAs the Palaces Burn\u201d by Lamb of God, comes Ashes of the Wake. I\u2019ve always been a fan of LOG since I first bought one of their albums, so I was really eager to check this one out. I\u2019m slightly surprised, not as happy as I expected, but I am also really impressed. This is pretty much similar to the shit on ATPB, but in a way, a lot better.\n\nFirst, the production is fucking awesome, same guitar and drum sounds as on their previous album. Vocals are fully audible, and do not block out the other instruments. Now onto the music...\n\nOne thing is for sure on this CD, all the members have improved a decent amount on what they play, especially Randy (vocalist). On \u201cNew American Gospel\u201d, their first CD using their new name Lamb of God, the vocals were very high pitched and leaned a lot more towards hardcore-type style, and at times were low. Those vocals were awesome, but he changed on ATPB, using mostly the semi-guttural ones, and very rarely went high pitched. But on this album, he shines. It\u2019s amazing how much better he got. His low sounds pretty much the same, but there is incredible variation. He screams high pitched a lot, and is very good at it. There are also extended growls that go from low to high, and sound really fucking angry. Vocals are a huge up to AOTW.\n\nGuitars are like they\u2019ve always been-fast, angry, and all over the place. But one thing I like more on this than on ATPB is that the tunes are a lot catchier, and you can really headbang. The riffs even get just a little bit technical at some point in \u201cHourglass\u201d, which by the way is one of the best on the album. Also, LOG was never really into soloing, and there are around 2 or 3 on ATPB the last time I checked. But there are a bit more solos here and there, and there\u2019s even an instrumental with some dialogue. So the guitar work is catchy and kick ass.\n\nDrumming...Chris Adler did a great job on NAG and ATPB, and is once again awesome, with a lot of double bass, and no blast beats :P (though I love blast beats).\n\nSo basically, \u201cAshes of the Wake\u201d is pretty much an extension of ATPB, but just a lot better in my opinion. They get a 93 for making a decently successful album. Though I would like some variation in their next. If you\u2019re a Lamb of God fan, you should definitely buy this...or download it illegally...And by the way, their single \u201cLaid to Rest\u201d is fucking bullshit compared to the rest of the CD, so don\u2019t judge them by their singles.\n",
        "\nI'm a big Lamb of God fan I guess, so I'll be the first to say that this album is good, but dissapointing. It seems they've taken the winning formula from their last album, and simply ran with it for another album with slight changes, but no significant improvements.\n\nWe've still got the face-kicking riffs with technical precision, but somehow the second time I'm hearing this sound doesn't impress as much as the first. I'm still hearing great drumwork from Chris Adler, but his role seems more that of an accompanying rythm instrument than that of a seperate instrument with his own soundniche. It's still top-notch, and there are hidden drum-noodles, but you got to search for the treats. Randy Blythe still screeches like a motherfucker, and is even MORE intelligible this time around, but he's not the Christopher Walken-esque essence of barely held back physical violence like on the last album.\n\nThere's some amazing music on this disc, as for example Hourglass. Old fashionedly good, it starts off very familiar, too familiar, but then after the one and a half minute mark it really kicks off, and builds into a beast of a metal track with instruments layered over eachother so that they enforce eachother untill it explodes into an orgasm of metalness at the end of it.\n\nThen again, by contrast, 'Now You've Got Something To Die For' seems a bit too formulaic for Lamb of God, a bit too anthemic even. And when I say formulaic for Lamb of God, I mean it's pretty amazing music, but I've heard it done before. So the whole album leaves me a bit ambivalent. Nice that I've got more material to feed my LoG fetish, but there's a bit of diminishing returns at work here. It also seems slightly simpler, but that could just be the familiarity kicking in.\n\nOne new element that had me wondering though, was the spoken intro to Omerta about Honor, revealing that this band playing 'American Metal' still has a link to hardcore. But that's just a dumb comment to close this review with.\n",
        "\nDeciding that Cradle of Filth was a bit too much for them, Sony have gone and snapped up Virginia\u2019s Lamb of God for their major label debut \u2018Ashes of the Wake\u2019. For most of us, the dreaded \u2018metal band meets major label\u2019 vibes were instantly apparent once we digested the stunning move that LOG have now made. Metal fans are mighty distrusting of the majors, and any move towards the corporate sector usually means \u2018sellout commercialism\u2019 and \u2018wannabe rock-stardom\u2019. \n\nFortunately, the powers that be at Sony have been wise enough to leave LOG to their own devices. Nope, there\u2019s not a whiff of radio friendly \u2018hits\u2019 on this disc. Aside from a slightly more polished production (which is an improvement), the rest of AOTW sounds like your regular LOG album. In fact, I\u2019d even say the band has become a tad heavier. The only other thing Sony represents for LOG is mass distribution and worldwide media promotion that is guaranteed to have LOG become a household name\u2026well, in the metal world at least.\n\nAOTW is a rather quick follow up to the excellent \u2018As the Palace Burns\u2019 of 2003. No doubt the major label backing and Ozzfest dates have motivated the band to capitalise on the astonishing momentum that they are currently enjoying. As such, it sounds a little rushed in parts with a tad over-repetitiveness creeping into their song writing. However, it is hard to ignore the absolutely stunning musicianship that is laid down here \u2013 those intricate riff passages wield a slightly Meshuggah meets Megadeth technicality, whilst the breakdowns and mammoth grooves employed on \u2018Palace..\u2019 have become even more pronounced.\n\nStylistically, most of what LOG does borrows from some long time metal favorites \u2013 namely Pantera and Slayer. Knowing this, the modern metal meets thrash vibe isn\u2019t that original. And considering the impression that their debut \u2018American Gospel\u2019 and \u2018Palace\u2019 made on the entire American metal scene (including the Metalcore fraternity) \u2013 in that everyone else made a transitional shift in that direction \u2013 we could say that \u2018Ashes\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound as fresh either. Where they had a certain individuality with their first two discs, LOG now tend to blend in with the crowd. Still, \u2018Ashes\u2019 is a powerful, unrelenting statement and filled with lots of intense and menacing rhythms that they are so synonymous with. Only the fickle (such as me) would complain about LOG supposed lack of variation in ideas. \n\nThere are some who think Randy Blythe\u2019s one-dimensional vocals are a major \u2018negative\u2019 for LOG. I tend to disagree, and while I wouldn\u2019t mind a little variation \u2013 there is no way a move toward a \u2018clean-vocal\u2019 sing-a-long chorus is going to happen with this band. That WOULD be their death knell. I\u2019m pleased that Randy continues to bellow and rage with forceful passion and conviction. If you\u2019re an angry man, you should sound like it. And Randy\u2019s angry!!\n\n\u2018AOTW\u2019 is going to cause much discussion in the months to come. Hell, it\u2019s already been hailed as a classic by some and derided by others for it\u2019s apparent \u2018safeness\u2019. I tend to sit somewhere in the middle (weak bastard I know) \u2013 there is no doubt that this is a highly enjoyable ride and it slays 90% of the competition outright - It packs a mighty wallop. However, as leaders of a sound and style, LOG are going to have to branch out on the next album if they wish to stay ahead of the rapidly closing pack.\n",
        "\nLamb of God's third, and latest release on their new label, Epic records...a subsidiary of Sony Music. First, a bit of history on Lamb of God...they toured extensively for their first album, New American Gospel, and gained quite a bit of following among their fellow American fans.\n\nBefore their sophomore effort, As the Palaces Burn, (produced by Devin Townsend of Steve Vai/Strapping Young Lad/Ocean Machine/billion other self-started bands fame) Lamb of God began touring more and more with hard/metal-core scenester bands. On the second album, there were a good deal more breakdowns and easily forgotten bridges which were most likely influenced by their environmental conditioning on tour.\n\nThird time around, after leaving Prosthetic Records, gaining a new producer(nicknamed Machine) for this album, they change their engineered sound once again. Guitar tones remain very similar to the second album, bass gets a higher priority, more clarity. Likewise with the drum mix, bass kick sound receives a huge low end boost and the snare has less of the trademark resonant ring pop from the first album. Cymbals are heavily edited in the mix this time around. This is for the better, since, Chris Adler, while having some of the most impressive double kick control around...relies a great deal on riding the same crash. All in all, this album has a better mix than the last, however, no song really stands out as a huge winner. Don't get me wrong, there are some nice songs, and I'll get to that part.\n\nIn a nutshell, this album has better riffage, better drum mix, (not necessarily better than previous albums) and much better bass clarity. When it comes to the core stuff, eh...similar amount of palm muting + riding the china cymbal breakdowns, as what was seen in the prior two albums. Breakdown shit is basically for fan service at the shows. When it comes to fan service, they still can't beat their first single, \"Black Label,\" regardless of them using it as a catalyst for the \"wall of death,\" ever since New England Metalfest 2003.\n\nNow for a track rundown:\n\n01. Laid to Rest - 08/10\n- Starts off with a guitar slide, bass palm mute, and double kick gallop+snare+crash, then another crash, but hand muted right away. Guitar riff played in right channel, then a single bass kick+crash as bass and second guitar come in on both channels now. Cue drum roll to crash and hand mute. After this little intro, verse comes in with crunchy riffs/double bass accented with snare hits on the harmonic pinches.\n\nCue a little tulilu for Mark Morton while Chris Adler starts up the steady double bass and seems to be riding a small splash with an extremely bright wash sound to it(almost like a splash chime). Also cue spoken word from Randy, which is very \"to each their own.\" On this song, it somewhat works with the instrumental ambience backing his voice. However, the spoken word intro for track 5, Omerta, ...terrible. I'll get to that later.\n\nChorus isn't that great, however, I do like how Chris Adler uses all 4 crashes in a row, rinse and repeat, throughout the chorus so that they each resonate fully on their own until he mutes two at the end.\n\nEnd of the song has some mixed in bottomed-out bass just because they can. It's not as bad as it sounds, but it just seems very gimmicky.\n\n02. Hourglass - 07/10\n- 21 Seconds has the bottomed-out bass hit again ala the end of Laid to Rest to start off the song, 1:03-1:23 is probably the best part of this song. After that, it pretty much slugs along, I could go into more technical detail, but the song's not forgettable, but mediocre.\n\n03. Now You've Got Something to Die For - 03/10\n- Fan service sing-along chorus. Turn off the mic. Forgettable song.\n\n04. The Faded Line - 09/10\n- Very similar to \"11th hour,\" track 4 on \"As Palaces Burn.\" Breakdown at 1:48 is actually good, even though I despise the greater majority of them. Lasts almost 35 seconds until 2:22. Like the end of many Lamb of God songs, pace drastically slows down into a groove.\n\n05. Omerta - 03/10\n- Worst. Spoken. Word. Intro. Ever.\nDoesn't help that Randy has a minor lisp to his speech and there is no ambient sound behind his voice to mask it. Mic also mixed terribly. Listening to this spoken word on monitor headphones through a 24-bit digital receiver and the vox is totally fucked up. Slow song that drudges along with no balls to it. Next.\n\n06. Blood of the Scribe - 07/10\n- Thrash off the bat. Song turns into \"For Your Malice,\" Track 5 of the previous album, at 1:36, until the end. \"For Your Malice\" was a good song, and so this is also good; but I like the old one better. It's consistent from start to finish.\n\n07. One Gun - 07/10\n- 10 seconds has the massive bass again. Solid song, above average. 2:50-3:00 cues massive editing of the snare and bass kick, huge resonance which you will hear more of starting at 3:20 until the end of the song, 3:59. Like I said, gimmicky, but it works.\n\n08. Break You - 05/10\n- Forgettable, save a few decent tom rolls.\n\n09. What I've Become - 09/10\n- Starts off thrash. Snare sounds mixed differently now, with the older, ringier sound. Turns into a groove. Goes generic metal towards the end. Song is done very well, perhaps one of the best songs on the CD.\n\n10. Ashes of the Wake - 06/10\n- Mark and Willie song. All guitar. Cue tulilu from Chris Poland(Megadeth, hope you knew this). American soldier with Iraq commentary strewn without. Theme: no line between good and evil, just chaotic rule.\n\n11. Remorse Is for the Dead - 05/10\n- The first two Lamb of God albums ended the CD with a pretty fucking epic song with some high BPM double bass and fast thrash. This...is just disappointing. Either the production was rushed to release this album or something, because this is no way to end an album. Voice editing at the end of the song to finish off the album is just sad. Lamb of God used to end albums with the best they had.\n\nAverage: 6.9/10 -> 70\n",
        "\nSo far, I'm surprised that there hasn't been any reviews really praising this album. Well, I'm definitely confident enough to rate this album highly. \"As the Palaces Burn\" is a great album, but I find \"Ashes of the wake\" to be much more superior sound wise, lyric wise, and over all brutality wise. \n\nFirst of all, the production on this album (done by Machine) is awesome. I can hear every word Randy is saying (no joke - every word), which is something I can't say about \"Palaces\". I can also hear the drums a lot better. In \"Palaces\" I can barely make out the cymbals in the mix, and the drums sound pretty bland. But in \"Ashes\" the drums sound real in-your-face, and you can hear every little splash, crash, and ping in the cymbals quite clearly... The guitars sound a lot cleaner as well, while still maintaining that heavy crushing sound. I know there are many that are a fan of the real raw sound, but I really prefer to hear every note and instrument, and understand the lyrics...\n\nWhich brings me to my next point: the lyrics. Man, these guys have got a lot to say. These lyrics are some of the most powerful, well thought out, and cryptic messages which I have ever heard. Right from the opening line \"There's blood on the wall, so you'd might as well just forget it!\" I knew this album was going to fuckin blow many of my other CD's out of the water lyric wise. I won't get into the themes here, you'll have to read for yourself. \n\nThis album is just fuckin brutal. The riffs are heavy as shit, and very well written. Lamb of God is just a straight up, no bullshit, metal band. Period. I haven't taken it out of my CD player since I bought it... hell, I'm listening to it now, which is probably my 20th straight listen in a row. I really have no complaints. The artwork is just incredible... Actually, the only complaint i have is the \"Parental Advisory\" sticker on the front. What the fuck is up with that? There is nothing \"explicit\" about this album IMO. Well... maybe to some momma's boy who can't handle the graphic artwork and the powerful lyrics. Other than that, I highly recommend this album. \"As the Palaces Burn\" is great, but this CD is far superior. I really hope these guys don't sell-out at any time... As long as they keep pumping out albums like this, I'll keep buyin.\n",
        "\nTo say that I was hoping this would be a good album is an understatement.\n\nWith their first two albums, 'New American Gospel' and the Devin Townsend produced 'As The Palaces Burn', I'd long come to the conclusion that while Lamb Of God's sound, whilst nothing mind-blowing or strictly original, was exactly that - their own sound, which no other metalcore that I knew of was making at the time... plus they sounded heavy as fuck, with the debut album even sounding intricate on a technical level.\n\nAside from the rather bizarre step of going from having producers with such high reknown as Steve 'Today Is The Day' Austin and Devin Townsend working on their albums, to someone who's name both escapes me and strikes no core of recognition anyway; Lamb Of God have opted for the rather pathetic step of trying to carry on the sound they had going on their previous album, that far from sounding relatively new just makes the album feel stoic and bland, which coupled with the fact that the other parts of the album sound like mediocre Killswitch Engage-tributes makes for a foreboding outcome on the acclaim of this album.\n\nI won't go as far as saying this is strictly a \"BAD\" album, it's just nothing compared to the bands previous material. Also you have to take into account the awe that 'New American Gospel', in particular the track 'Black Label', struck into me when I first heard it, as well as the sense of progression you got when you first heard their next album.\n\nAs much as I lament to say it, Lamb Of God's songs on 'Ashes Of The Wake' blur into one more or less totally monotone and dare I say it, formulaeic brand of bland metalcore that quite frankly doesn't really cut the mustard anymore.\n\nThe band CAN do better, of that I'm not really in doubt, it's just whether they choose to stop kissing up aurally to Killswitch Engage & Shadows Fall long enough to realise that on their day they can be far superior to either band.\n",
        "\nWell...to answer this question, yes and no. This had been my first LOG album, and I was a bit skeptical about them. I had seen the videos of \"11th Hour\", and \"Black Label\", which I really liked, so I decided to check it out.\nLamb of God start you out with \"Ruin\", which is fast with heavy riffs which change in key from time to time, but keeping the same rhythm. It is a great kick-off for the rest of the album. Overall, the majority of the songs, such as the title track, track 3, 4, 5, are somewhat fast-paced and have a kick ass beat to them so you can really headbang. The drummer, Chris Adler, is just plain awesome. Most of it has fast double bass like all good metal albums do, but not any blast beats from what I remember. Though I like them, it suits this album better the way it is. Tempo changes are rare, but happen ONCE in a while. All the songs flow together smoothly with the beats. If you have heard NAG, then you know how screechy they are(which isn't so bad). It's the complete opposite for this. They are very low, and you can actually hear what the fuck Randy is growling this time. I don't really care if I can interpret the words in a song, but it's a nice addition to this. Guitar solos are exceptionally rare, but the few ones they have like in \"Ruin\" are just sweet. \nThe production is really nice on ATPB, unlike on NAG, for one reason because they have a lot more money. The guitars and vocals are solid and audible, and the bass drum has a very smooth sound to it(one letdown of Gospel), not flappy like on NAG. \nThe one reason I personally like NAG more, is because of the angry brutal riffs, that just sound like screams of anger and hate turned into music. This album is much more organized and precise which is better, but you don't get that feel you do from NAG. If you haven't heard them, you should really check them out and buy this CD. It's a solid release from Lamb of God, and I can't wait to hear Ashes of the Wake! :D\n",
        "\nLamb of God has certainly had a history. They're \"just a bunch of rednecks how like to play metal.\" Watch Terror and Hubris, and you'll have new found respect for Lamb of God. This CD has intense riffs and crazy screaming. In Ruin, the first scream lasts for 15 seconds, and rips through two octaves. The crazy brutality that not many other people can meet and the insane riffs that only Lamb of God could have made make this album one of the best ever. \n\nIf this CD isn't on your collection, I'd go buy it today. \n\nRuin - This song starts out with heavy assed guitar and bass, and of course the best scream that I've ever heard. Some people would say that it sounds too scratchy, but a raspy voice suonds kind of cool on this album. The guitar fills in with brutality, and the end of the song where the slow part comes is even really good. \n\nAs the Palaces Burn - We're a generation of pacified fools, and Lamb of God makes that clear t ous through this track. As the Palaces Burn is 2:24 of good lyrics, drums that shred you into pieces, and guitar lines that fit perfectly with the fast paced rythym. \n\nPurified - One of the best songs to headbang to. Yet again this song is brutal, as are all of the songs on this album. I like the way that this songs beggining is written, and the rest of hte song carries your attention through miles of chaos. \n\nEleventh Hour - Bein gthe best song on the CD, it starts with some heavy drums and godlike guitar. It soon brings you into a drum beat that is common, yet awesome. This is the next to perfect song for the moshpit. And only Lamb of God could have the best two. (WALL OF DEATH) The best part of this song is the few seconds of bridge between the first and second half of the song. Its heavy and hard-hitting. (enough said) \n\nFor Your Malice - This song is like the happy break at the end of four pulverizing songs. Although it was meant to be a slower song, the tempo is tsill pretty fast, and the happy part only lasts a few seconds. Its right back to the brutality. I'm not complaining. \n\nBoot Scraper - The intro to this song is heavy and fun. It lasts for all of 32 seconds until the part where this song starts to take off. It gets much better after the begging, and it maintains the heavy part for the rest of the song. Ther could have been better drums parts, and some better riffs, but its a decent song over all. \n\nA Devil in God's Country - Devin Townsend got a little crazy when he helped make this record. If you couldn't tell, this is Devin Townsed, of Strapping Young Lad, singing. He helped make the track, so they let him sing for trhe recording. He's used to a different style of metal, but he swtill sounds good on this, and there are parts where I can't make the disticntion between the two singers. \n\nIn Defense of Our Good Name - This song defends Lamb of God's reputation like nothing else. Its heavy and has good instrumentals. Its back to John singing, but I'm not complaining. Drums have a good sound in this song for some reason not known to me. In the middle when the song starts to wind down, you can tell that there's going to be a nice fast paced and heavy ending to that phrase. \n\nBlood Junkie - This song isn't as heavy as the others are, but it still rocks. Its the downwinding part of the album, and its a damn good song to do it with. It gets you ready for a break from the brutality, and Vigil will help you with that. \n\nVigil - Starting out with the begging it does, you would think that this cd would end on an easy note. But if you know Lamb of God, they can't go a day without a faster and heavier riff. They were just kidding, they wanted you to have good thoughts of this cd, and they did a good job of it. \n\nBuy this if you dont have it. It can just plain murder most metal bands. The happy break is followed by a heavier and beter song, and every time you think they're going to go soft on you, they get better than before. Great album worthy of your music, and better than your everyday metal band.\n",
        "\nWhenever I hear this, or a lot of other metalcore and assorted other things so heavily praised in the FUNderground, I swear that I've already heard it before. It makes me stop and think and say -- oh wait, didn't At the Gates already do most of this with Slaughter of The Soul? However, though it's what it first struck me as, Lamb of God isn't quite an AtG clone. If you put SoS-era AtG, post-hair band Pantera, and maybe a bit of some Converge-style hardcore in a blender and set it to liquefy, you'd get something similar to Lamb of God.\n\nThis is an interesting amalgamation, that may be an attempt to hit the lowest common denominator in what's been the most popular in the metal scene in the late 90s, but it's quite well done for that. A good deal of it alternates between Pantera style groove and the style of At the Gates at Slaughter of the Soul, where they have some really good thrashy riffs interspersed with a heavier Gothenburg style of melodicism. There's also some hardcore elements present, such as breakdowns and the random use of dissonance, but it leans much more towards the metal elements. The guitar tones on this are possibly a bit too thick and muddy, and it makes the album sound a lot more drudging than it really is. As for the vocals, I don't think much of them -- they actually are almost monotonous, consisting of almost nothing but half-growled, Anselmo-style vocals. The occasional solos are decent, but also suffer from the bad tone, as well as the rhythm guitar being seemingly louder in the mix. The drumming isn't bad at all, either.\n\nThere's some good headbanging moments on this album, but it doesn't last more than 30 seconds, and the rest of it makes me visualize flyswatting hardcore kids and pits when I think of what seeing it live would be like -- perhaps that's just me being traumatized, I'm not sure. However, the fact that this is becoming more popular is a good thing -- it's a huge leap over anything else, and beats the living fucking hell out of any mallcore. There's also no bullshit in here like there is in a lot of the mainstream funderground -- no emo lameness, no rapping, no chugga-chugga mallcore, no pointless attempts at trying to be br00thal, or anything like that.\n\nThis is one of those albums that I can't say it really sucks, but I can say it's definitely overrated. Of course, compared to all the other crap people who now listen to this listen to or used to listen to, it probably is amazing, mindblowing stuff, so it's no wonder people have been raving about this for the past year or so. However, I felt like I had heard it all before, and though it's tolerable and occasionally good, it's nothing I'd normally bother listening to.\n",
        "\nAt The Gates . . . you fucking whore. Close your legs and stop giving birth to bands like Lamb of God who add the melo-death element into the mix. After the demise of ATG, countless bands have been highly influenced by the infectious and friendly sounding genre of the Gothenburg scene, Lamb of God is no exception.\n\nFirst thing I notice is that despite the raspy sound of the vocals, it did not bother me at all. It actually fits the \u201cmature\u201d sound of Lamb of God. The \u201cmature\u201d sound LoG creates is unique, unique in a way that it you can probably guess right if one of their songs were played randomly in a playlist among other young modern mainstream bands that incorporate the abundance of Gothenburg riffs. The riffs? Highly unoriginal, it is this that makes this release oh so very bland. \n\nI know it is hard to be original nowadays, but LoG simply do not execute on this release. You start with the first track, \u201cRuin\u201d and think to yourself, \u201cHmm, ok. No pussy intro, aggresive, they go directly into the music with lots of energy and a thick riff you can headbang to. Oh wait, why am I yawning?\u201d But Jesus fucking Christ, it is like being blindfolded, feeling like you are enjoying the best blowjob in town and you open your eyes and find out that the hairy, greasy 50-year old whore down the block is supplying you pleasure with her AIDS ridden mouth. Very misleading. THAT is when you realize the value of this album. After \u201c11th Hour\u201d the rest of the songs are garbage. Totally half-assed, everything, the drumming, bassing and you can not leave out those dull riffs that have been done countless times before. They absolutely seem desperate on the very hardcore sounding \u201cBlood Junkie\u201d, near the end of the song they have some sort of Arabic sounding riff to keep the listener interested, I just laughed.\n\nYes, it got BORING relatively quickly, but I did enjoy a couple of tracks with some surprisingly good drumming. If they cut their playing time for each song to less than 2:30 like \u201cAs The Palaces Burn\u201d, which wasn\u2019t too bad, I think it would keep the listener a bit more interested. Slow songs do not fit into this style of music, and they just rely on Melo-death riffs when they can not think of anything else and just waste playing time. To appeal to the younger crowd they throw in breakdowns, solos and Pantera-ish groove with lots of energy (sometimes). In reality this quintet offer nothing groundbreaking.\n",
        "\nThe one way to summarize an album like this, is to just start headbanging.\n\nBeing one of the bands (and albums) that lead the Metalcore genre today, Lamb of God (and NAG) have outdone themselves here. On a good day I can just listen to this album and say \"Well hell, screw \"True\" metalheads, this owns.\" Others I put it on, put on my game face >:{ and headbang. The album truely has thrashy elements to it, like in the drumming. \n\nThe drumming is more than solid, it's just fucking great. Its fast, powerful, its creative and it even includes fucking double bass riffs. Not that other bands don't build upon their drumming, and make it so the drumming is complex but follows a pattern.. but here it really feels like their drummer is riffing. This guy.. owns.\n\nVocally the album kills, too. Randy was probably my first role model in vocals, and because of the evil strength in his voice. He sings deep, which seems to be something seen rarely in metalcore. Where it is populated with half-growls, we get actual growling vocals. Where the genre includes talking, we get higher pitched screams. Not like screams, but more like metalcore's version of black vox. Its sinister, it really is.\n\nThe riffs are pretty fast, and create a nice, headbangable environment. This shit isn't pure thrash, but it creates a good feel like it. At some spots the speed drops and they go for a heavier atmosphere, but it works just as well. It all comes out sounding really good, especially for metalcore.\n\nBass lines aren't few nor far between. Creating a, yet again, distinctive feel, they hold everything together with deep noises and while not as fast or hard as the guitar riffs, they do their job and create a hold over anything sloppy to make it sound good.\n\nIn my time listening to this album, I've yet to find one problem with it, exept maybe the fact that every one of my friends calls me a \"goth\" for it. That's not a problem wiht the album, though. The only TRUE problems that anyone might care about, is that in spots the songs aren't as clear as they could be, for one reason or another. Maybe a few bits of the main riff of a song dosn't sound perfect, but nothing is.\n\nBottem line: get it. Now.\n",
        "\nI just love bands that keep up previously set high standards, while still innovating their sound.\n\nFans of the previous Lamb of God, New American Gospel, might be dissapointed at first. I know I was. At first it seems as if they don't have the same 'punch' as first. The precisioned kick in the head that was NAG might seem to have been lost in the fattened sound. Similar to their progression from Burn The Priest to NAG, the sound has become even thicker again. If it was still a bit thin on New American Gospel, here the sound is more 'modern'. They can probably thank Devin Townsend for this; the guitar sound occasionally reminds me of Devin's own bands. The drums blend more into the overall sound instead of standing apart.\n\nOne might suspect that LoG's technicality/precision gets lost in the heavier and thicker tones as the edge of the sounds become muddier. But Lamb of God in the end benefits from the thicker guitar and drumsound, as it provides them with a broader base to build their agression on. This is not your father's Lamb of God, the songwriting is different now. I'd say they've used a more holistic approach, where instead of a logical progression of songbuildingblocks, changes are longer in the making. As a result, the songs stand firm, cohesive as a whole. Which means the first few times you hear this album, it won't sound as good as what you're used to from Lamb of God. However, in the end, once you've listened to this album several times over, the album emerges triumphantly. The different approach means the songs grip you in the long run. This time it's not a simple riff that is going to grab you by the balls, these are songs that take you by the throat.\nBecause of this setup, some riffs might seem similar, and some of songs uninspired...at first. My advice: don't worry and give the songs time to grow on you.\n\nThe underlieing emotions are the same as on New American Gospel, even if it has a snuff less encroached paranoia, and a few pinches more in-your-face passive agression.\n\nAnd I almost forgot to mention the vocals. Instead of the razorsharp screech of previous work, it's a low-key gruff version thereof. It's less menacing, but more 'I'm here now, there's no running from me, punk'. And there's added intelligibility.\nThe drums are still done by the awesome Chris Adler, although his skills aren't translated to an awesome presence this time around; there's less fills, he sticks to and interweaves with the songstructures instead of diverging from and expounding on them. Both the drumming and vocals on 'Blood Junkie' are more typical of previous Lamb of God in this respect; compare it to say '11th Hour' if you want to hear what I mean.\n\nIs this album better than the last? I can't say. I must admit this album doesn't have the surprise 'Oh my God'-feeling as the last album had for me, and it doesn't have a standout song like Terror and Hubris. But the album is extremely good as a whole, and since each song grows so much on you, I've become more attached to this release. It's not the straightforward thrill, it's the quality experience that counts here.\n",
        "\nWoa, a band with their own sound. Of course I could say this for their Burn The Priest album as well, but as Lamb of God they've really marked off their own corner in musicland with New American Gospel.\n\nTheir sound has become thicker (less thick than on the later 'As the Palaces Burn'), and also more accurate. No more occasional smudgy buzz-riffs as with BtP, but razorsharp precision riffing, semi-staccato or otherwize, and accompanying drums and vocals. These guys know exactly what they're doing: they're delivering a kick in the face with remarkable self-contained violence.\n\nSpeaking of the drums: Ye Gods! Chris Adler can DRUM! This guy can drum amazingly tight and well-timed. Drum-riffs are actually used as a seperate niche in the sound. Sometimes I'd almost say he was actually converting thrash-metal guitarriffs to polyrythmic drum-patterns. The drumssound isn't meaty at all, it's more 'tock-tock-tik-tock'-esque, but this means the overall sound comes out well instead of being drowned by thumping drums. At any rate, this guy keeps surprising me with the way he drums. Often staccato, and very varied, it really builds out the guitar-sound, sometimes throwing in odd timing signatures.\n\nThen the vocals, razor-sharp high-mid range growly shrieks, often follow the rythm of the music (which is odd for vocals). I can't make out most of the lyrics this way, but Blythe's vocals sound menacing. He doesn't sound angry, or enraged, but violent.\n\nIf I had to list top-songs, I'd be giving a tracklisting minus 'A Warning' and 'Pariah', but I'll list 'The Subtle Arts of Murder and Persuasion' and 'Confessional' as 'personal most favorite'.\n\nThis is an album I intensely enjoy (if that much wasn't obvious from the review), as almost every song has elements I particularly like, and Lamb of God's sound has me in awe. The only possible quip with this album would be that not every song sounds totally different from the others, as there are common elements, but that's minor since the basis is excellent anyway, and I'm sooner thirsting for more than less.\n",
        "\nHey, for being a modern American band, these guys aren't half bad. However at times they stray just a bit too far into the two deathfuck traps of modern music: namely hardcore bullshit and Swedish melodic bullshit. Most of the time they have a recognisable riff going, and most of the time it's a decently enjoyable one.\n\nThis band reminds me superficially of Pantera... there really are some solid thrash riffs to be found here - unfortunately most songs don't really feature them as overtly as they should, especially when we get to the latter part of the album. Most of the time this is a Far Beyond or a Trendkill-like album.\n\n11th Hour sounds the most like some Swedish reject - the melodic riffage and the underlying harmony guitars are definitely there, though there are some decent riffs in there too. A Devil in God's Country just sounds far too much like a hardcore song to me, with the least competent riffage of the entire album. Also, Ruin is pretty fucking weak for an opener, and Vigil just almost floats along on drawn-out, as opposed to choppy, riffage. However, the final riff set is very excellent. \n\nThe highlights now... Purified. Holy crap, this one just smokes. That one's the only song that really would keep my attention. I guess the main problem of this album is that it's too similar-sounding and plods on for too long without a real variety of great songwriting ideas. Also the vocalist has trouble really conveying emotion - he's got that distort-a-growl thing going that just doesn't work - it sounds like Trendkill era Pantera the most. But Boot Scraper also has some pretty decent riffs.\n\nThe vocalist is a bit monotone at times, and that's really what gets on my nerves after a while... that and he is mixed way too loud into the sound. Also at times the drum patterns are a pain in the ass - not a St. Anger klonk klonk, but the snare drum is still pretty loud. \n\nThe one thing that they really must be commended for... no mallcore whiney passages! They do de-emphasise the guitars sometimes, but only to make really grooved stomp riffs, which aren't exactly the greatest thing ever, but at least we're not tempted to assrape the poor guy again just to kill him.\n\nIt's not a great album, and at times it sounds too hardcore to be really good, but it does have the occasional really cool riff. I'm just not sure if I can wade through the bad ones to get to them.\n",
        "\n.... because it kicks more ass than Clubber Lang in a blood frenzy. Yet, As the Palaces Burn is dwarfed by its predecessor, 2000's extreme metal meisterwork, New American Gospel. If NAG was a towering behemoth of reckless intensity, 'Palaces' is a more subdued beast, menacing, but not overtly so. Those true metal purists who can't handle Lamb of God's hardcore leanings will probably embrace their new direction, since the order of the day is less breakdowns, more melody, and a somewhat reserved approach to creating kick ass heavy music. \n\nOf course, Devin Townshend produced, and did a satisfactory job. The guitar tone is suitably heavy handed, and everything else sounds good. I was worried he would botch as bad as \"Natural Born Chaos\"...\n\nOpener Ruin grooves along with a classic Celtic Frost stompin' rhythm, and the first thing you will notice is Mr. Randall Blythe's vocal approach... instead of rabid wolverine screeches, he growls in a lower, almost INTELLIGIBLE register. There are less Meshuggah knock off riffs, although Ruin sports quite a mighty one... it's more of a circle pit song than a flat out killfest (Black Label). \"A Devil in God's Country\" reigns in some serious energy and comes the closest to recapturing New American Gospel's vibe... to be fair, Purified is equally as brutal. \n\nMy favorite songs, though, are 11th Hour and For Your Malice, two uncharachteristic barnburners with MELODIC riffs and what can only be described as infectious choruses. 'Hour''s verse reminds me of an Exodus riff, until that incredible guitar part kicks in... killer stuff. Blythe executes a few Anselmo-isms in FYM (that low mumble thing he does in This Love..), surely lacerating his larynx in the process. \n\nLamb of God put themselves in a tough spot... destroying everybody with a classic debut album and not being able to deliver the same product again. Like, Don't Break the Oath is nowhere near as good as Melissa, but cool nonetheless... Nevermore's Enemies of Reality is great, but no Dead Heart in a Dead World. Fans of heavy music in general need to rally around Lamb of God because they are the genre's great white hope.\n",
        "\nSomewhere on the sonic spectrum between Meshuggah and Pantera (w/ some Malevolent Creation thrown in for good measure), VA's crushing Lamb of God have big things ahead if 2000's New American Gospel is any indicator. Barbed wire guitar riffs, constantly shifting time signatures, and a singer whose voice brings to mind any number of wild animals make NAG one of the heaviest discs I own.\n\nBlack Label kicks off with one of those riffs that makes you go \"oh shit what's gonna happen next\" and ends up being a relentless barrage of intensity (the story of this album). LoG focus more of the rhythmic aspects of the guitars (which are produced as raw as they come), but when leads do appear (Terror/Hubris) they are damn good. There is a strong Meshuggah influence no doubt -- check out that Future Breed Machine riff during In the Absence of the Sacred, but not enough to prevent LoG from forging their own style of brutality.\n\nI must say that Randall Blythe's vocals are the most ridiculous in metal. At times they barely sound HUMAN, and you can hear the force put behind them, always a plus. There are no power ballads in Lamb of God... this is just pure 100% HEAVY FUCKING METAL through and through.\n\nThe only song I couldn't dig on was the last one, a sort of sludge/NOLA groove dirge thing ala Crowbar that stretches on way too long. They should of used the japanese bonus track, Nippon, cos that song FUCKING CRUSHES. So in conclusion, if you like metal heavy and enjoy the modern breed of intense bands, you'll be all over Lamb of God. Now let's cross are fingers and hope Devin Townshend (who's producing their new album) won't destroy their sound like he did with Soilwork.\n"
