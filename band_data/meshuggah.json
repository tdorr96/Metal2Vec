        "\nTimes from \"The Violent Sleep Of Reason\" to \"Immutable\" were not the most favorable. First, more than 4 years have passed, second, over this stretched time, the band went through pandemic and strange line-up inaccuracies. Luckily, all of these adversity managed to put together and stabilize, which ninth longplay of Meshuggah was released without embarrassment and unnecessary complications - which is not difficult in these type of circumstances. What is the strangest, quickly after the album came out, \"Immutable\" sparked surprisingly mixed opinions. In fact...at the stage of releasing the singles!\n\nThere is something in it, unfortunately. Calculations and no new \"editions\" for the first time makes Meshuggah's later album as a reduction of their characterisitc high level. Well, \"Immutable\" often makes impression that songs were composed samey, tiring too much alike mofitis (also these from previous cds)...even within one song! For this reason, a lot of songs blend together into one mass (which is not helped by duration of the album - over an hour), of which not much attract attention apart from djent patterns, mathematic combinations from bar to bar and acompanying to this screaming vocals of Jens Kidman. It's nice indeed \"Light The Shortening Fuse\" (catchy melody of riffs), \"They Move Below\" (expanded instrumental with calm beginning a bit in style of later [!] Cynic), \"Broken Cog\" (song-introduction with a rhythm, which surprisingly brings some associations of Disturbed most famous hit - \"Down With The Sickness\") and \"The Faultless\" (massive groove and psychedelia a'la \"Catch Thirtythree\"), but that's all. Rest of the songs are quite fine, but they fall in one ear, out the other imperceptibly. Not really good impression make also: metalcore-like (?) interjections in \"The Abysmal Eye\" and \"I Am That Thirst\", stop-gaps in the form of completely unnecessary \"Black Cathedral\" and \"Past Tense\" or overall the production of the album itself, which sounds very synthetic. The only thing left to do is to be glad that the heaviness of the 8-string guitars has not completely disappeared.\n\n\"Immutable\" is therefore an album that keeps a fairly correct level, but at the same time, this is an album that does not stand out with anything special and does not go beyond the well-known patterns. Previously, this approach for Meshuggah worked perfectly; on the \"Immutable\" Fredrik Thordendal's band entered the case entitled generic djent.\n\nOriginally on  A bit of subjectivism...in metal \n",
        "\nThe psychologically sounding title and abstract 3D cover may suggest that the content of \"The Violent Sleep Of Reason\" will come as no surprise to the background of \"Koloss\", which...also did not turn Meshuggah's discography upside down. And everything is correct, because Fredrik Thordendal's band does not spit out releases by force, and when something newer comes out of them, it's still a very high level and balanced between their standards and introducing certain differences. The case is no different with the 2016 release.\n\nOn their eighth longplay, Meshuggah totally doesn't reinvent the wheel and plays in a similar regions as on \"Koloss\", although it crushes with the really heavy sound and mathematic rhythms as well as before. Well, with songs such as \"Born In Dissonance\", \"Violent Sleep Of Reason\", \"Clockworks\" or \"Nostrum\" it's clearly audible that the Swedes need no major changes in sound or used patents. Okay, the minor \"editions\" are (more about it later), but not enough to make fans feel completely confused by the content of this album. The quintet from Meshuggah over the years has developed a very characteristic style, so their target is known (i.e. they are not looking for new fans) and they are a point of reference for themselves. However, as I have already mentioned, it makes sense in the case of this band. Tracks in the style of previous albums attract with a groove, and are not based on boorish auto-copying; on the other hand, the exceptions like \"Stifled\" (melancholic atmosphere towards the end) and \"Our Rage Won't Die\" (a more thrashy feeling at the beginning) make this averaging more fresh. The sound is also doing well, as it seems to be more \"compact\" compared to the previous discs (there it was cooler on the previous ones).\n\nSimilarly to the \"Koloss\", \"The Violent Sleep Of Reason\" is an album that roughly rolls out what is known and liked from Meshuggah, fortunately it does it with sensitivity and elegance. Although it's a bit lacking such hits like as on their previous album, but it does not rule out its high form and the general sense of releasing such safer lps. Well, this type of approach in Meshuggah's discography is perfectly reasonable!\n\nOriginally on  A bit of subjectivism...in metal \n",
        "\nAfter the gigantic success related to \"Obzen\", Fredrik Thordendal's band decided to impose a slightly slower system of composing new music and gave up of madness beyond the developed style. In their case, however, it all fits together. The Swedes did not fall into too intrusive publishing and imitative composing of subsequent songs, and despite creating a certain comfort zone, they allowed for some minor changes, so that newer albums could be distinguished from each other. An example is \"Koloss\", which was the first to follow such a theory.\n\nThe seventh longplay of the group from Ume\u00e5 is surprising to a small extent, although it does not mean that it brings a drastic drop in level or a tendency that may describe Meshuggah as a band of one trick. On \"Koloss\" the quintet does not discover anything new, but they do not repeat to a fault the same melodies, rhythms or general atmosphere from the previous albums. Well, with all this \"calculation\", you can quickly see a different idea for the above-mentioned patents. Just take a closer look at such tracks as \"The Hurt That Finds You First\", \"Demiurge\", \"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\" or \"Behind The Sun\", in which there are a lot of impulsive and melancholic (?) atmosphere, what happened on previous albums sporadically or...wasn't completely! Apart from this, the disc includes - of course - djent certainty, which perfectly fit into the well-known standards of this group. Among them, it's worth mentioning, for example, \"Swarm\", \"Marrow\", \"The Demon's Name Is Surveillance\" or \"I Am Colossus\", where everyone in love with the sounds of \"Obzen\" should worship this album (so the author of the review, too). A blot on the landscape here is only the outro-track \"The Last Vigil\" that closes the album, which with its \"muted\" character breaks the somewhat aggressive tone of the whole cd. Fortunately, the other elements of the disc, as the title kind of suggests, turn into equally coherent and colossal (!), djent music.\n\nHence, it's clearly visible that with the release of \"Koloss\", the Swedes did not rest on one\u2019s laurels and knew which way to take their style further. They decided to take as a \"starting point\" the patents from \"Obzen\" and develop ideas around them; so it would be groovy, progressively, but not 1:1 like on previous album. And what's the best, on \"Koloss\" (but not only - about it in next reviews) this approach proved to be excellent.\n\nOriginally on  A bit of subjectivism...in metal \n",
        "\nFrom among the best group in Meshuggah's discography, i.e. \"Nothing\"-\"I\"-\"Catch Thirtyfree\"-\"Obzen\", the last of them is their most sought-after album, largely due to the fact that it quickly gained...meme status. The song \"Bleed\", which began to be called the new equivalent of Slayer 0-0-0-0 (who knows the music theory, knows how reliable this meme is...) and a revelation among guitar youtubers dealing with more modern types of metal, owes everything. Fortunately, it turned out just as quickly that \"Bleed\" is not the only thing that \"Obzen\" has to offer. Well, the sixth longplay of Fredrik Thordendal's band showed that this group, despite a large number of excellent albums (not including the newly recorded \"Nothing\"), is able to create another, excellent album at an equally outstanding level as before.\n\nSo on \"Obzen\" the band abandoned the concept album format and returned to the normal separated songs. The music itself, in turn, does not deviate too drastically from the patents from the three previous albums, although it focuses on an even greater groove and twisted atmosphere (so as to overwhelm the listener with 8-string sound as possible), and to a much lesser extent on weirdness and avant-garde \"jumps\". This move...makes sense here though! \"Obzen\" is one of the most massive and best balanced (in terms of djent and progression) albums in the discography of these Swedes. This means that even if the band presents - in the vast majority - their \"company\" patents, they contain enough minor inserts (like feeling, progressive patterns or atmosphere) to make it impossible to describe this album as repetitive or as a copy from the previous ones. \"Combustion\", \"Dancers To A Discordant System\", title track, \"Bleed\" (sic!) or \"Electric Red\" are just some of the examples in which it's immediately possible to catch this separate character and the ideas to develop their earlier style. Well, at the same time, these Swedes without trying to discover a \"new self\" excessively (after all, they've already managed to do it once), again showed that they can create brilliant, djent songs in their own characteristic way.\n\n\"Obzen\" is therefore one of the most important albums of the late Meshuggah. The Fredrik Thordendal's band managed to keep the ultra-high level of their predecessors on it, and at the same time show that it's possible to improve some aspects within the djent style and do a bit differently. This was also clearly demonstrated by their next albums, which - for the most part - shared a really similar approach to composing.\n\nOriginally on  A bit of subjectivism...in metal \n",
        "\nCircumstances surrounding the release of \"Catch Thirtythree\" were so downhill that Meshuggah already had a fairly well-researched ground of extensive and more experimental forms in its djent style, without risking anything. This does not mean, that this five (with the new bassist Dick L\u00f6vgren - although he has not played on this album yet) decided on it to simply extend themes from \"I\", because - as it turns out - \"Catch...\" is a sequel with a much greater momentum and referring to those themes quite...superficially! The level and character of the music of these Swedes remained completely unchanged, again very high and with new, unique ideas within djent music.\n\n\"Catch Thirtythree\" is a single, 47-minute track divided into 13 smaller parts - more than twice as long as the contents of the 2004 ep. However, this longer total time is fully justified here. Contrary to \"I\", the fifth disc of Meshuggah develops more phased, contains significantly less avant-garde inserts and gives more moments to reverberate the most groovy parts, which in general makes it a bit more accessible and more spacious. But that doesn't mean there's something wrong with that! Well, these changes are petty good and do not take away the power or multidimensionality of the music. Well, \"Catch...\" is filled with amazing patents and a lot of math. At the same time, the whole cd is so cleverly and carefully composed that even the layman listeners will also find a lot for themselves here. The overall heaviness, the post-apo atmosphere, clean guitar insertions, more mechanical drums (they were programmed), a large number of \"concert\" rhythms, twisted solo parts (this is the most similar aspect to the previous ep) or even the simple patent like spoken interlude (I am talking about the vocoder fragment) impress in an extraordinary degree, the most on their all albums. On \"Catch Thirtythree\" a division into the aforementioned 13-part tracks also does not disturb the all perception - a perfect refernece to Fredrik Thordendal's solo album.\n\nThe fifth cd by Meshuggah is another great example of the fact that despite having already a few awesome albums in discography, the band still wanted to develop and improve very high level to another dimensions. The intention was made excellent because \"Catch Thirtythree\" is not inferior to its predecessors (and is better than some) and brings a new quality to Fredrik Thordendal's band.\n\nOriginally on  A bit of subjectivism...in metal \n",
        "\nHere is the second proof after \"None\" that Meshuggah's minor releases are as much noteworthy as their regular albums. Two years after the release of the excellent \"Nothing\", this Swedish group decided to go even more crazy than before, releasing an ep entitled \"I\", on which Fredrik Thordendal's band was tempted to expand their characteristic style with quite a large package of extraordinary solutions for a djent style. Due to such a less typical format, they also showed that they are not afraid of more experimental forms of publishing their music.\n\nThe content of \"I\" consists of one colossal, 21-minute track, the momentum and ingenuity of which exceeds the standards of the previous (!) albums. What's even better, despite the large volume and complexity of the material (which I will tell you about in a moment), this ep is perfectly composed and the individual motifs, even if they contain some leaps, pass between each other meaningfully and know when to give way for the more groovy parts. Take for example playing from eight to twelve minutes, this is one of Meshuggah's most overwhelming passages ever! The leaps mentioned are even more interesting. These are manifested by really crazy ideas for riffs (very dissonant), twisted solos, sudden transitions in \"clean\" style or precise, mathematical drumming by Tomas Haake. And this, in effect, comes into djent chaos, although...made intelligently and without adding any avant-garde accessories earnestly!\n\nSo \"I\" is in no way inferior to full-length albums. Because despite the successes of \"Nothing\" and \"Chaosphere\", this ep shows perfectly well that the Swedes had an idea in which way to lead their music so that it would continue to be djent, and at the same time appropriately different. It turned out so tasty that at any moment an equally successful sequel was created for \"I\" in the form of a next full cd.\n\nOriginally on  A bit of subjectivism...in metal \n",
        "\nMeshuggah's first album, recorded on eight-string guitars, turned out to be a bit cheated, because the \"Nothing\" used...sevens, but with a lowered tuning to imitate the eighth style. Apart from this biting remark, there is still nothing (hehe) that could qualify as a defect, given the level these Swedes have climbed here. Because despite the lack of a bassist in the line-up (these parts were additionally recorded by Fredrik Thordendal), these djent visionaries managed to create in 2002 one of their best albums in their career. And to such an extent that, in fact, no extensive introduction is needed to reflect the fullness of the \"Nothing\" class.\n\nSimilar to \"Chaosphere\", \"Nothing\" doesn't bring big changes, but focuses on polishing its style to perfection. Okay, this time, the nu-metal interjections were eliminated from the whole set-up, but overall, Jens Kidman and the rest of the band decided to mostly stick to pure djent sounds, i.e. decided to increase the heaviness and math madness without breaking the essence of their style. Ironically, however, there is quite a surprise here! Yeees, the sound and technical madness on previous recordings were very massive, but what the Swedes achieved on \"Nothing\" is astonishing that this formula could be developed even further. The sound crumbles the walls here like monster trucks crush passenger cars - that's how ruthless it is. Of course, the production of \"Nothing\" is not that all what this album has to offer. The compositions themselves is another great topic, i.e. full of groove, shredded riffs, \"schizo\" solos, progressive extensions, Jens's screaming vocals and a nervous climate, for example, exemplified by \"Perpetual Black Second\", \"Rational Gaze\", \"Organic Shadows\", \"Closed Eye Visuals\" or \"Glints Collide\", which fall like a knife through butter despite their hermetic character. Needless to say, the level of these songs exceed the compositions from previous albums! The end of the album looks a bit different (i.e. \"Spasm\" and \"Obsidian\"), where there is more place for a twisted atmosphere. Fortunately, it's perceived as well as the other songs, because it does not deviate from the djent areas and sensibly gives a moment of respite...to press the replay!\n\nTherefore, \"Nothing\" perfectly combines the best parts of \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" and \"Chaosphere\", and at the same time offers a different, but equally interesting idea for grooviness and progressive patterns - so that it would not be repetitive. Most interestingly, the evolution of Meshuggah's style did not end there. \"Nothing\" opened the direction to the next progress of this band, which was discussed more in the next reviews.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2022/07/meshuggah-nothing-2002.html\n",
        "\nThe shift from thrash metal to djent vibes made Meshuggah a pioneer of this mathematical style. The Swedish quintet (with the new bassist Gustaf Hielf) decided not to rest on one\u2019s laurels and relatively efficiently, because 3 years later, decided to take this style to the next level, i.e. focsuing at similar sounds to \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" and \"None\", but with the expansion of new ideas. The result of this ingenuity was \"Chaosphere\"; an album that raised the level even higher than previous cd and showed another, very interesting face of Fredrik Thordendal's band.\n\nThe changes on \"Chaosphere\" are not colossal, although they are quickly catchy and quickly indicate that it's not \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" part 2. Compared to its predecessor, \"Chaosphere\" is much more nervous, and additionally, like no other Meshuggah's album, it also has...nu-metal influences. Yes, one of the most hated styles in the mainstream metal! And here it deserves special praise, because these influences were used in moderation and mainly within - literally a few - more noisy guitar patterns and some rap-like vocals of Jens (e.g. in \"Neurotica\", \"The Exquisite Machinery Of Torture\" or \"Corridor Of Chameleons\"). Besides, \"Chaosphere\" is dominated by a djent, i.e very groovy and mathematical metal, as exemplified by \"Concatenation\", \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\", \"Sane\" and \"The Mouth Licking What You've Bled\". At the end there was also a quirk - \"Elastic\". Well, after the normal part of the track is played, this song turns into a hidden track where...all previous songs are superimposed at the same time! An interesting idea, but it's a pity that before you get to it, the listener is forced to break through noise wall. In turn, there is nothing to complain about the other elements of the disc, the production has improved (including the livelier sound of the drums), and a large dose of similarly fragmented rhythms does not bother you here.\n\nAs a whole, \"Chaosphere\" is therefore a must-have when it comes to illustrating the essence of Meshuggah's style. Because despite the small nu-metal inclusions (which, surprisingly, are successful here), the third album of Fredrik Thordendal's band shows perfectly how the djent style should look like. What's most interesting, \"Chaosphere\" is also not the peak of these Swedes!\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2022/07/meshuggah-chaosphere-1998.html\n",
        "\nShortly after the \"None\", just a year later \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" was released and the Swedes from Meshuggah made a lot more hype than last time. However, hype did not come out of nowhere, the mid-90s of the twentieth century was generally abundant in groovy playing in the metal mainstream of that time, in turn what was on the \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" was quite neatly in line with these trends and brought a breath of fresh air. From this album, the band of Fredrik Thordendal in its full glory gained the reputation of pioneers of the djent (which the musicians themselves are surprisingly not very fond of).\n\nThe turning point for the content of \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" is the songs \"Humiliative\", \"Gods Of Rapture\" and \"Sickening\" from \"None\". Fortunately, that doesn't mean that the band decided to extend that mini-cd either without thinking or serving the same patterns in too similar version. Absolutely not! On their second album, the Swedes from Meshuggah - above all - put much more emphasis on math rhythms, groove metal heaviness, bizarrely crazy progression and a highly dehumanized atmosphere. And best of all, all these twisted news came out to the group on \"Destroy...\" really delicious.\n\n\"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" is extremely nervous, heavy and overwhelming, and at the same time very mathematical and with a lot of progressive inserts. A huge contribution of this, of course, to the ingenuity of Fredrik Thordendal and Tomas Haake, but also to the empathy of Jens Kidman, whose screaming vocals (as I jokingly describe it, as an angry James Hetfield) even more cause the overall, futuristic atmosphere of the album. Just take a closer look at \"Terminal Illusions\", \"Sublevels\", \"Burn\", \"Inside What's Within Behind\" or \"Future Breed Machine\" and hear how much the atmosphere of the album is inhuman. A small reference to the debut was found only in \"Transfixion\" and \"Vanished\" (due to a slightly more thrash metal feeling), but the feel of the djent style is the most interesting here. As for the minuses, the \"Acrid Placidity\" interlude was unnecessarily placed here, and the \"squeaky\" ending of \"Beneath\" (but the actual song itself fares really well). There is nothing to complain about the rest of the components, even that the music of this band is extremely hermetic.\n\nBy \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\" Swedish Meshuggah has officially gone into the djent. This move, however, should be strongly praised, because one, they sensibly developed the ideas from \"None\", two, they managed to record an even better, full release from the above-mentioned patterns, three, they managed to carry these patents further, on next discs.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2022/07/meshuggah-destroy-erase-improve-1995.html\n",
        "\nBefore the world got to know the Swedish Meshuggah as one of the most important (if not the most important) in the trend of djenting, Fredrik Thordendal's band decided to enter a new style rather slowly, releasing a smaller release, by ep \"None\". In addition, the group decided to expand the line-up into a quintet, which resulted in Jens Kidman abandoning his guitar duties and fully focusing on vocals, with M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m recruiting as second guitarist. And the only thing that remains...is to applaud such changes! Because all of these new solutions - as I will show in a moment - transferred the music to an even more interesting dimensions.\n\nThe entry into a new style, despite a slightly modest format, took Meshuggah to a different level. In retrospect, this ep is - together with the debut - one of the most unique releases in Meshuggah's career. At the very beginning, however, everything is still quite normal. In \"Humiliative\" and \"Sickening\" the band presents djent in its - as it will turn out later - unique style, i.e. as a mathematical, shredded, crushing metal with a large dose of groove, and at the same time (and paradoxically) abundant in rhythmic \"sawing\" and heaviness.\n\nIt gets weird with the third track - \"Ritual\". Well, this track sounds like a cross between thrash-groove vibes with...Alice In Chains! Fortunately, nothing wrong with that, because it's one of the most atmospheric and inventive moments of this ep. You can perfectly hear the group's considerable ingenuity and an interesting idea for this - it would seem - extreme combination. Later, in \"Gods Of Rapture\" the band mostly returns to the atmosphere from the beginning of the ep, with the difference that with the use of keyboards to add to the slightly \"schizophrenic\" atmosphere. Against the background of what was at the end, \"Gods Of Rapture\" is...like a \"delicate appetizer\" compared to \"Aztec Two-Step\"! Well, in this hidden track, Meshuggah flew away towards industrial or even noise sounds, unlike what you could hear here before. In addition to unnecessary silence, it's also one of the greatest moment in the career of this Swedish band (another thing is that there were a lot of them).\n\nThe cohesion of \"None\" is not the strongest asset, although it's hard to underestimate the compositional courage and imagination of Fredrik Thordendal's band. By this ep, the Swedes from Meshuggah discovered their own, much more unique, style, and \"by the way\", they also experimented a bit with less djent climates - which mostly did not happen later. It came out unique in that none (hehehe) of the songs from \"None\" were repeated on subsequent releases (this ep was only added later in the form of bonuses to \"Contradictions Collapse\"), and the group itself on the following discs turned into a \"pure\" djent. It doesn't mean that the band stopped playing interesting because of \"None\". Absolutely not - this is the beginning of their most interesting period in their career.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2022/06/meshuggah-none-1994.html\n",
        "\nThese crazy Swedes had a surprisingly weird start to what they (later) became famous for. First, a small confusion with the names, of which, of course, Meshuggah endured the most, then the formation of the line-up and recording the music. And...actually, nothing weird or unusual about it! However, as you know, appearances can be deceptive - such a clich\u00e9 to keep the balance of the review. Well, Fredrik Thordendal, Jens Kidman, Peter Nordin and Tomas Haake recorded on their debut \"Contradictions Collapse\" music that exceeded the usual classification.\n\nInterestingly, at the debut stage, Meshuggah's style had little to do with the djent, which later brought them worldwide fame. In 1991, the style of this Swedish band could be described as technical thrash metal with a large dose of progression and...groove metal! For this reason, they simply had to come up with a unique mixture of styles or something less common in general. It also happened. \"Contradictions...\" is abundant in going beyond typical patterns. In addition to the characteristic thrash metal \"sawing\" or occasional, lively groovy elements, there is a lot of mathematical rhythm, twisted solos and elaborate progressive motifs. The best examples of this mix are definitely \"Choirs Of Devastation\", \"Abnegating Cecity\", \"Errorneous Manipulation\" (an extremely stupid text here), \"Cadaverous Mastication\" (bonus track but very nice), \"Qualms Of Reality\" or \"Paralyzing Ignorance\" - which is a lot. The issue of Jens's vocals is also interesting, as his singing resembles the more screaming James Hetfield (there are also spoken and group ones; more melodic, in turn, much less often). On the downside? Personally, these more crossover patents (not much, but they break the coherence of the disc a bit) and the length of the disc (it lasts nearly an hour; cutting 10 minutes would rather not hurt it). Apart from these details, the whole of \"Contradictions...\" looks really interesting.\n\nThe beginning of Meshuggah, although different from what will be next, is an interesting treat from the perspective of bizarre mish-mash in metal music. \"Contradictions Collapse\" is not as good as the next albums, although it also had a lot of solid sound and - most importantly - a lot of extraordinary solutions. Even opponents of djent style may be tempted.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2022/06/meshuggah-contradictions-collapse-1991.html\n",
        "\nIt's a shame that I didn't enjoy this record, because Meshuggah was one of my first exposures to extreme metal, and a lot of their earlier material is great. However, Immutable has been immensely hyped over the last few months, and now that it's finally here, the music itself is very bland, and I believe that the band can do much better. Firstly, this definitely sounds like Meshuggah; right from the opening track Broken Cog, the entire song consists of a downtuned groove and a dissonant melody with awkward semi-clean vocals.\n\nOf course you can't expect Meshuggah to not implement this into their music, since it's their most iconic characteristic and virtually their entire discography is filled with grooves, but this is also what killed the album for me. The music just doesn't feel energetic, and the overuse of monotone, repetitive riffs with irregular strumming patterns gets old very quickly. We get it Meshuggah, you guys can play in odd time signatures, your fanbase knew that before Destroy Erase Improve came out, so why bother trying to mindlessly prove this almost 30 years later, when you are perfectly capable of making truly great, memorable music?\n\nImmutable would be hugely improved if the band had utilised this habit of playing in low tunings and relying on grooves, to be somewhat creative and diversified. No one wants to hear 2 notes being played for 4 minutes, and that presents another huge flaw in this album: the repetition and seemingly seldom use of changes in motifs drag the songs out, until they become unbearable chores that are listenable in the sense that the music itself isn't annoying, but it's mind-numbingly dull, and these aforementioned 4 minute songs consequently feel like 11 minute songs. \n\nI don't understand why Meshuggah feels the need to be this minimalistic, when the music is supposed to be exciting and energetic. Take Phantoms for example, that song opens with 2 notes that alternate with no fixed pattern for 2 and a half minutes. Why? It doesn't achieve anything or build any tension. Almost every song is exclusively mid-tempo with a boring verse-chorus structure that drones endlessly.\n\nNow, this album isn't completely devoid of merit, otherwise it would have a lower score, and there are some very apparent positive factors of Immutable. The vocals are vine, and while Jens almost never varies his vocal style, it fits the music fine. Additionally, the guitar tone is great, and I think the combination of the slow melodies over the groovy riffs is mixed very well, the problem is that this is ubiquitous and is featured in every song until it doesn't sound interesting anymore. The clean guitar intro in They Move Below is admittedly beautiful, and is by far the highlight of the record, sounding similar to Tool. \n\nImmutable isn't a very rewarding experience, the album is way too one-dimensional and formulaic considering its runtime of over an hour, and I would only recommend They Move Below and Armies of the Preposterous, which itself is an example of impactful and strong riffing. However, there isn't enough content in this album, and the content that is there is largely below par for the standard of the band.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah in the 2000s became a center of controversy for hardcore metalheads. As the band moved deeper and deeper into djent territory, many accused them of losing touch of what made them so special in the first place. The bass lines became more potent and the guitar riffs got chunkier, perhaps inspired by the rise of nu metal, Meshuggah simplified their sound and admittedly lost some of their magic in doing so, but their popularity exploded because of it. And it makes sense, their sound is catchy yet intricate, and they were able to sacrifice some of their songwriting credibility for more exposure. But that doesn't mean they \"sold out\" because djent is not really a genre where selling out is possible. They were still incredibly experimental and far ahead of their contemporaries, even with a slightly more commercial sound.\n\n\"Rational Gaze\" is a straight crusher with its heavy riffs and, again, Jens Kidman sounds fantastic with his typical aggressive shouting. The band works in more upbeat drumming and the passages are louder, more explosive, and segue nicely after the frenetic hooks. The guitar playing is business as usual, the riffs are technically solid and although they follow a similar formula, no two Meshuggah riffs sound the same. The solos are slightly more melodic than on the previous few albums but still retain that cold rhythmic delight. They even get vividly groovy on \"Glints Collide,\" a track with some really cool effects while otherwise sticking to the band's bread and butter. \n\nThe standard pauses on \"Organic Shadows\" are nothing new for Meshuggah at this point, so don't be alarmed, but what is new is the band's songwriting takes a few more turns than usual. The difference between technical and progressive metal is usually that technical involves complex time signatures or chord progressions while progressive includes a lot of variation in the song structures and the incorporation of unorthodox influences and ideas. Up until this point, Meshuggah had been primarily a technical metal band, as their song structures were usually nothing crazy. With Nothing, however, this changes, and the band begins cycling through four or five different instrumental passages in between verses or the hook. The solos are more scattered and feel like interjections rather than expected breaks from the riff-focused bits of the songs. This movement towards more varied song structures is a nice twist for Meshuggah.\n\nThe main thing holding this album back from reaching that upper echelon of their career is that it is a bit more one-dimensional than their usual stuff and it does have that slight commercial edge. The band was less (but not by much) focused on their originality and capabilities than they were by hitting the mainstream. So while this doesn't derail the songs completely, tracks like \"Spasm\" might come off a bit weird for Meshuggah because their aim is different. This is a metal band faced with an ultimatum of abandoning their roots in favor of fame, which is a tough decision to make. Thankfully, they found a compromise, and Nothing wasn't quite the train wreck that many people think it was.\n",
        "\nAfter Contradictions Collapse, the band's debut, Meshuggah would go on a roller coaster ride of studio albums with different themes, intensities, and influences, although all of them were of a pretty high quality. Chaosphere is the band's second best album, following the debut, and provides the strongest and most consistent collection of songs the band would put out for the next thirty years. This album is relatively straightforward and concise, technical as ever, and vocalist Jens Kidman sounds absolutely phenomenal.\n\nWhile most djent albums from Meshuggah are usually lumped together as having the same sound, there are subtle differences. Chaosphere, ironically, is actually a bit more methodical and passive in its approach to songwriting. The riffs are extremely technical and are played at strange time signatures, but a track like \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\" showcases that the band doesn't have to turn the aggression all the way up to write compelling material. And as these songs are only four or five minutes in length, the band shuffles through their usual repertoire of ideas in a shorter time frame, building tension as the songs almost reach their breaking point over and over. Frederik Thordendal has some incredible guitar leads and solos on this record, too, putting the icing on the cake for what is an outstanding rhythm performance by M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m. There isn't a bad riff to be found on this album.\n\nProduction-wise, this album also represented a shift towards a much cleaner sound as the band utilized flawless production techniques to get a very mechanical sound. For some bands, this can suck the soul out of a record, but Meshuggah's identity is their technical prowess, so it gives some support to the insane riffs and bass lines played. Gustaf Hielm plays like a madman on this record, especially on the adventurous \"Elastic,\" a brilliantly-written song that spans fifteen minutes to close the album out. In terms of sheer creativity, this album blows Destroy, Erase, Improve out of the water. The robotic soloing over the typical slab of catchy riffs (you can pretty much guarantee this from a Meshuggah album) further adds to that mechanical, overly-technical feel of the album. The band even incorporates some industrial influences like on \"Corridor of Chameleons,\" demonstrating how versatile they are as songwriters.\n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn't be a Meshuggah album without Jens Kidman screaming like a maniac on every song. His vocals seemed to only get better with time; even as he aged he never lost that pure-spirited aggression. This album captures his vocal intensity perhaps better than any, \"The Mouth Licking What You've Bled\" is simply a masterpiece for him, harnessing the chaotic atmosphere of the instrumentation and coming off like a straight villain. Not to mention, although he isn't a major part of the closing \"Elastic,\" his vocals are dynamic enough to be extremely effective when they do pop in. Overall, it's hard to find another album in Meshuggah's career that is as diverse and as technically proficient as Chaosphere, although there are quite a few that come close. This album captures the essence of what makes Meshuggah so great: calculated chaos.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah returned four years after their mechanical and spirited debut with a slower, more methodical and mathematical approach to their groove metal aesthetic. This time around, the band is operating in more of an industrial and progressive vein, and although they seem to have a better grasp on songwriting, the ideas they put forward aren't as fresh as they were on their debut. This is the album where the band began to shift towards the proggy djent sound they'd become ubiquitously known for.\n\nThe songs on this album are generally shorter in length but feel more powerful, likely due to the absence of many of the thrash elements that comprised Meshuggah's debut. This album is purely mid-tempo for the most part, focusing on carefully-constructed riffs and a steady drum beat, along with meticulous bass work from added-member Peter Nordin. The extra love shown to the bass definitely gives the band's sound more power, and with their decision to slow down for the majority of the album, this album feels very well controlled- though still absolutely off the walls in terms of energy.\n\nThe A-side is spectacular: \"Beneath\" and the brutal \"Transfixion\" are unique, powerful, and extremely complex both in terms of structure and riff construction. The demanding instrumental prowess that Meshuggah exhibits on this album only gets more interesting as the record spins on: \"Terminal Illusions\" has both compelling lyrics and a ridiculously intricate riff that runs circles around the odd time signatures from drummer Tomas Haake. Where the band takes some steps back is in the diversity of this album, because the songs do feel grouped together more than on Contradictions Collapse. While they don't fall into the pothole of every song sounding the same like some metal bands, they come close. The riffs are generally stemming from a very similar root, though they are novel and unique to Meshuggah that it doesn't matter too much. Think of it this way: a lot of thrash bands write similar riffs, but as long as it's different bands writing them, it's never a problem. So what's the issue if Meshuggah recycles an idea or two here and there?\n\nThis is a very solid followup to Contradictions Collapse. The debut pointed towards a lot of unexplored territory with Meshuggah's technical style of riffing and complex song structures. Destroy, Erase, Improve seeks to expand on that formula by incorporating a more mechanical influence and by essentially digitizing the drumming (though it was still recorded live). The results are a batch of songs that are still compelling and interesting, but it does feel like Meshuggah punches under their weight for a breath or two. Still, the intensity and theatrics of songs like \"Soul Burn\" and \"Suffer in Truth\" cannot be denied, and this would be a worthy addition to any band's discography.\n",
        "\nSimply put, Meshuggah is the most consistent producer of quality albums in all of metal (of bands still kickin' it today). From their humble beginnings as a groovy thrash band with a technical edge, Meshuggah always had a level of musicianship that made their music very easy to enjoy, and deceptively complex when analyzed. The odd time signatures and staccato riffing would become mainstays for the band's sound, but in 1991 this was still a relatively new idea (there was no Dream Theater or TOOL yet). \n\nThis record is filled with fantastic ideas, propelled mainly by Fredrik Thordendal and Jens Kidman on the guitars writing some of the most technically sound and creative riffs around in the early-'nineties. The band wasn't quite at the djent phase yet, though the primordial pieces are clear as day. The band runs closer to Pantera-meets-Coroner than their 2005 self. And actually, this works wonders for the band. Although Meshuggah has yet to put out a bad album (and only a handful that aren't great), Contradictions Collapse still holds up as their strongest collection of songs. The band sounds hungry, and Kidman sounds completely visceral behind the mic. It isn't quite death metal or grindcore, but something about the low-tone growls just spice this album up loads. Even with the occasional backing vocals adding a juvenile touch, the band still sounds fierce.\n\nAs for the instrumentation, each song on this record manages to fulfill its own identity. The riffing is extremely varied and occupies a wide expanse of tempos, intricacies, and overall tones. The bass work is stellar and extremely sharp- slicing through the mixing with ease and really grounding these songs. Songs like \"Erroneous Manipulation\" and \"Internal Evidence\" are among quite a few that span over six minutes but they hardly feel like it. The band cycles through so many ideas and keeps their wheelhouse spinning on every track that it's honestly hard to notice when one song ends and another begins. The album just blends as a single listening experience. The solos are all complex, diverse, and extremely colorful- whether they're long or short. Some bands seem to have a style that can fit in multiple genres. Think Def Leppard in NWOBHM and pop metal, or Darkthrone in death metal and black metal. It makes you wonder what Meshuggah could have been if they shifted gears back towards groove metal or technical thrash instead of... inventing a genre. Oh well, can you blame the choice they made?\n\nThere's often three metal bands (sometimes four, depending on who you're speaking to) that get thrown around as leaders of modern metal: Mastodon, Gojira, and Meshuggah (occasionally Lamb of God is mentioned). And while I agree with the sentiment that these three bands are the most innovative, talented, and successful metal bands of the twenty-first century, this is not 1A, 1B, and 1C. Meshuggah is leagues ahead of what these other two bands have done, even with Gojira's Fortitude being one of the best metal albums in recent memory. Meshuggah simply has too many layers to their sound that keeps every song interesting. Pair this with sleek production and a never-ending well of vibrant ideas to fill out fifty minute albums like it's nothing, and Meshuggah has a strong case to be considered one of the best metal bands of all time, point blank period.\n\nContradictions Collapse is the start of one of the most impressive runs in music history, with Meshuggah batting 1.000 through nine albums as of early 2022. And although this achievement is decades in the making, the signs of greatness are there if you look for them on this debut album. \"We'll Never See the Day\" has some songwriting tactics that are simply one of a kind, and \"Greed\" is an equally remarkable track with an extremely progressive composition and just marvelous guitar work. The band would have its commercial peak later on, but in 1991, Meshuggah arguably reached the apex of their artistry, although their tank was very far from empty.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard this charade of fart noises that barely resembled a guitar, accompanied by some angry guy screaming, (\"album\") I couldn't believe it was Meshuggah. I had only known them for \"Contradictions Collapse\" back then. But it was. It was Kidman's voice, the logo looked similar, and the drumming was still Haake's drumming. Good God, what went wrong? Why did Thordendal buy that cut cheese pedal?\n\nMeshuggah was on the crossroads right at the moment of its conception. They could've been a new Metallica, (\"Contradictions Collapse\") right after the original one sold its soul. Instead, they went for being the heaviest band out there with their refined seven-string tones. (\"Chaosphere\" and \"Destroy, Erase, Improve\") Which was okay. But the more gimmicky electronic side of Chaosphere also brought Meshuggah a new audience, who reacted very positively to that bullshit which would also be Meshuggah's demise, instead of the traditional groovy Destroy, Erase, Improve. So they just ditched heaviness and went for a new album that was little more than a rhythmic compilation of bowel movement noises. Cheese cuts. Farts. Loud, low-range ones.\n\nThe rhythmic side of Meshuggah would become dominant in their following albums, with the slightly melodic side of them also returning. This, however, is little more than two uncreative assholes chugging a bunch of random notes chaotically on bass strings attached to a surfboard being passed as a \"guitar.\" The bass is in the sub-contrabass range at this point, and inaudible at most times. Tomas has no real bassist to cooperate with, so he just follows the guitars, which also nullifies the drumming here. I still love Kidman's vocals, but they aren't as passionately angry as they get in Destroy Erase Improve, nor as technically impressive as Chaosphere. The man is just shouting. Still, his shouts might as well be the only things making this album worth a few minutes of listening.\n\nWhile I respect all kinds of artistic effort and never give out a 0% rating, Meshuggah really asked for it here. Both for making an album so bad that calling it shit would be an insult to shit, and for killing their old selves and creating a shitty pseudo-metal band that middle-class minnow teens who think they're tough can enjoy.\n\nHighlights: Fuck you, no highlights.\n",
        "\n\u201cNo worries, I found the new Metallica... they\u2019re Swedes; a bit stiffer and more mechanical, but great stuff all around\u201d. The words of a friend spat out in the early days of September 1991 while we, a group of metalheads, were wondering what to make out of The Black Album that had come out a month prior... shall we keep it in our collections due to the couple of songs that we really liked (\u201cWherever I May Roam\u201d, \u201cThrough the Never\u201d); or shall we discard it as a detrimental precursor to a trend that we all could see rising, ready to detonate the foundations of the old school?\n\nBut thanks to this exploring dude here it seems like we should start packing our troubles right away... the guy has found the new Metallica, yahooooo! Yes, he says that this new batch sound a bit stiff and mechanical but hey, who the fuck doesn\u2019t?! It\u2019s metal we\u2019re talking about, after all; some rust sticking out here and there is inevitable... and you\u2019ve got to love the name: it sounds like \u201cmachine\u201d; it sounds like \u201csugar\u201d; it sounds like \u201cbeluga\u201d, my favourite at the time whale species, the all-white one, the Arctic waters dweller... you know it. In other words, \u201cgreatness\u201d was spelt across the sky multiple times; it\u2019s gada be something good. It\u2019s gada...\n\nand, to be perfectly punctual, the new Metallica had actually appeared before the Black product of their idols. In fact, the whole concept was conceived some time in the late-80\u2019s when a sudden switch from the current moniker to the exotic Calipash took place. While the fanbase were searching through the history books to find out more about this Calipash, supposedly a forgotten Swedish/Viking hero, there was this lad who revealed the mystery, from a culinary/recipe book mind you: \u201ccalipash\u201d was the name of a part of the turtle that could be found right underneath the shell; a big delicacy. So I was right about the seafood connection, with this beluga, earlier then... anyway, reportedly, a steadfast diet based on this calipash induces hallucinogenic visions largely involving the Apocalypse, and before you know it our team here were looking at the Four Horsemen, or rather their earthly incarnation, the famed Metallica cohort from the other side of the Atlantis... sorry, Atlantic. \n\nA fairly good demo was swiftly stitched, showing a predilection towards the complex more mechanized sound of \u201c...And Justice for All\u201d. Then came an abandonment of the calipash diet, a very expensive dish by the way, and a subsequent transition to the old Meshuggah moniker. The eating habits of the new horsemen changed but not the musical influence which stayed the same on the demos and the EP which followed suit, naturally leading to the collapse of all contradictions accumulated through these early stages... eating, musical, hallucinatory... on the album reviewed here. With half of the compositions taken from the demos, a change in delivery is out of the question although those, who have sat down to listen to the album with the anticipation of \u201c... And Justice for All 2\u201d, would be a bit alienated by the cold dystopian shredding unleashed on \u201cParalyzing Ignorance\u201d, an admirable futuristic headbanger also showing Thordendal angrier and overall noisier than his peer James Hetfield. The relative immediacy of this opener is cancelled outright by the dispassionate mid-paced juggernaut-like stubbornness of \u201cErroneous Manipulation\u201d, the stiff and the mechanical qualities mentioned by my friend coming to the fore, quickly assembling the dominant robotic skeleton that sounds both peculiar and intriguing, readily allowing more flexible flights of the imagination like \u201cAbnegating Cecity\u201d and the choppy nervy \u201cInternal Evidence\u201d. Blazing stylish leads frequently roam around, these tractates never excessively overlong, either providing a needed balladic respite (\u201cQualms of Reality\u201d) from an array of clinical sterile shreds, or serving as a breezy lubricant to a rigid sterile main frame (\u201cCadaverous Mastication\u201d). \n\nThere are also moments where the album fully embraces the strictly classic canons, like on the excellent dynamic ball of technicality \u201cGreed\u201d, this lively roller-coaster well-deservedly carrying the album-title earlier (initially it was agreed on \u201c(All This Because of) Greed\u201d). However, betting on greed, of all mortal sins, especially when you have already chosen stiffer, more parsimonious ways of expression was a bit misleading and boom, \u201cContradictions Collapse\u201d it became. Besides, that last title more objectively alludes to the musings contained within: the musicians\u2019 retro metal heart was melting, slowly but surely, both under the pressure caused by the insistent metamorphoses already begun on the musical mental plane in the early-90\u2019s; and by the guys\u2019 own seeping creative visions that were stretching beyond the classic regulations, ironically requiring a more limited set of tools but at the same time boldly defying the established musical gravity. \n\nA title that also promised a less disillusioned future: the band were shaking off their aspirations of old school metal grandeur, contradictions were fading, ready to collapse on future instalments, the result of their not very obtrusive presence here by all means on the positive side, compelling if bewildering clinical mathematical prog-thrash that had to preserve some ties to the panting retro metal movement if the guys wanted to inherit the mantle from the other Horsemen. A statement made clear if not particularly very loud: \u201cwe did begin our journey as old school metallers; we acknowledge our influences, we don\u2019t find it necessary to hide them behind a thick bulletproof turtle shell; obviously, we want to take over from our US peers, but this won\u2019t make us blind to the new possibilities that are shining brighter and brighter on the horizon.\u201d \n\nPromises nicely fulfilled, quite shortly after the album here as well, but done through a much more intricate, mind-stimulating perspective, one that made our new Horsemen major players on the 90\u2019s field and beyond. A transformation that I can only compare to the one of a small, barely visible turtle, which believed in itself, and surely and determinedly crawled out of its shell in order to turn into a wholesome white whale... long live the new WWW seafoodhood!\n\nSitting here in Umea, the band\u2019s hometown, at the one and only seafood restaurant I was able to find... what the hell happened?! No wonder the guys have started churning these lethargic monotonous soundscapes recently... their diet has deteriorated. I ask for my favourite beluga fin soup first, but the waiter carefully explains that this dish has long since been crossed off the menu for violent non-sleepy reasons... nah, I don\u2019t have time to listen to those, I\u2019m famished. I ask for the legendary calipash dish; I know it\u2019s been a staple in this town for many years... at least I\u2019ll have a plateful of it. The salivation ensued gets interrupted by the waiter\u2019s hesitation... what the f...! He isn\u2019t sure about this one either, but he\u2019ll go and check with the chef... he withdraws with a guilty look in his eyes. I can hardly believe my ears. I\u2019m that close to going crazy, and when that happens, I often catch myself spitting curses in Hebrew... there was this Jewish guy, who happened to be in that restaurant when I went ballistic one day, that shouted \u201cMeshuggah!\u201d at me. He looked nothing like a metal fan; and I wasn\u2019t wearing a T-shirt of the band... and it was later when I found out what he had actually shouted; \u201cCrazy!\u201d... in his mother tongue. He thought that I would understand him...\n\nyeah... I think I have to get out of here... and of the entire unhealthy year altogether. At least I'm able to say \"Cheers!\" with this sprightly strong virus-killing Swedish aqua... sorry, akvavit. Damn those dreams of water... sea... food...\n",
        "\nI'm pretty much done with Meshuggah at this point. Boring riffage, drum programs, vocals that are going stale, and a production value that makes me wish I never decided to review all the Meshuggah albums. However this album is different. It's monumentally different, it spawned the abortion of a genre known as Djent, one that has become the laughing stock of the metal genre. People who genuinely like this album are the same people who probably listen to circle drum whisper groups from some backstreet alley on the streets of Los Angeles, or some other hippie town along the west coast, and only because it is 'deep and meditative.' This record sucks.\n\nJens, I am done complimenting you at this point. Your vocals have become formulaic within the molding corpse of Meshuggah, and are now starting to show signs of death and decay. I used to enjoy your vocals, and you redeemed yourself with I, also the whole band. I hoped that you could pull it through, even with the release of Catch Thirtythree, but no, no you didn't. You fell back into the Nothing shit-stain, with the dull boring shit that made it impossible to finish. I guess the only thing I can remark on positively is \"Combustion,\" but even then you aren't that good on it. Good job, you suck.\n\nEven with Dick back, the instrumentation department has only stale and moldy bread. I will be completely honest, after I heard the album opener, \"Combustion,\" I was kinda hopeful. It was fast, had creative drumming, a fun bass line, and some actual fun guitar parts, then \"Electric Red\" decided to rear its ugly head. Five minutes of the same boring riff. Marten and Fredrik, an open letter to both of you, stop. Stop trying. You both are creatively drained. It is getting very painful to listen to. I can hear you guys following Dick more than your own riffs. Tomas, you too are starting to become drained, except in certain cases. \"Bleed\" is a damn fine example, and has been after it skyrocketed this band for its batshit insane drumming pattern, becoming the thing of legend within the metal community. I mean the song is okay, I especially like the drumming, but looking at it as a whole, it is not anything to special. The guitars and bass get REALLY fucking boring about three minutes into the song, and Tomas' constant blast beat loses its effect after the third or so listen of that song. The timing isn't even that weird, its actually standard, 4/4 timing. Its just that Tomas is playing stupidly fast. \n\nProduction is, meh to say the least. Bass is audible, guitars are a little too loud, drums are quiet, and Jens vocals are a little too loud as well. Alright, I am fucking done. I hate this god damned piece of shit record. I fucking detest it. I wish I hadn't spent an hour trying to listen to this fucking filth. It's just going to be the same shit over and over again. Bad vocals, bad instrumentation besides Tomas, bad production, 'cryptic and self-exploratory' lyrics, it won't ever end. It is doomed to repeat over and over. These albums disappoint me. Meshuggah dissapoints me. They have so much potential to break out of the shitcaked djent mold, but they never do. They keep on wallowing in their own filth and somehow make money for being just good enough to keep the masses enthralled. On occasion they'll put out a few decent singles/songs, but other than that, it is all the same bull-crap from the get-go. Djent is fucking shit.\n",
        "\nWith the phenomenal release of their EP I unto the masses, everyone at Meshuggah Co. was thinking up of any POSSIBLE way to surpass it. Then, someone said (probably Fredrik) 'What if we did it again, but LONGER?' And thus, this trite was shat out. Now, there are some good segments on this track, but they are so far and few between that it is like looking for a hay in a fucking stack of needles, cause, like Nothing, this album hurt to listen to. Not as much as Nothing, but just enough for me to want to die, not have an overarching necessity to. \n\nGod dammit Jens, you know how to make a bad album somewhat listenable. On this edition of I wish Jens was in a better band, he provides some damn solid vocal work. Great screams, creepy growls, and some questionable choices on how to use a synthesizer. He hasn't changed all too much from the bands last, and somewhat good, endeavor, keeping in tone with his path. Yes, he does unfortunately not deliver in parts I would like him to, but that doesn't mean all of his vocals are bad, besides on Mind's Mirrors. Guess what dumb thing Meshuggah did this time? Auto-tune. Fucking auto-tune. Like come on, I know that you like to be \"experimental\" and all, but that? Really? It was totally out of place on this, or any record by this band. Not a smart idea. \n\nHey, remember Dick? Yeah, he's not on this record. My biggest question is why? He gave the last record something new, made it more exciting I guess. With him playing, he really kept the band from being to reliant on the bottom two strings, as this time, it totally shows. More times than not, I hear more \"chunk chunk\" than playing on higher strings. And, quite questionably, Marten, Fredrik, AND Jens all do bass and guitar. Like come on! Get your act together and hire a bassist! Keep Dick on the fucking recording staff you insufferable shits! Also, on Fredrik's and Marten's part, and I guess Jens too, significant lack of solos. Like droning on higher strings in the background is NOT soloing. Soloing is playing a series of notes in key with the notes being played, albeit one or two octaves higher, not buzzing on one or two fucking strings at a higher god-damned frets. Come the fuck on. Well, at least we have Tomas' drummi- 'Drum programming.' What. The. Fuck. That was the only thing I was looking forward to, Tomas laying down a destructive beat with his monstrous drumming, not a fucking program. Huge letdown. On a different note, there are some parts that were kind of heavy, like \"In Death-Is Life,\" \"Shed,\" \"Dehumanization,\" and \"Sum.\" Those parts have somewhat acceptable writing, other than that, boring playing and repetitive riffage. \n\nMixing is not good. Jens' vocals aren't too loud, but can be kinda quiet in parts. A good example is on the first part, \"Autonomy Lost.\" It is a little quiet, but is sorted out by the second part. The guitars take up way to much space. The bass can barely be heard, which is totally opposite of Meshuggah's last endeavor, I, in which it was totally audible from the first fucking notes. If you want to really listen for a clearly audible bass part on this record, good luck you fuck. Totally disappointing on that aspect. ALSO, the program is way to quiet. It is almost as if they weren't proud of using it, of which they shouldn't be. Use a real kit for fucks sake.\n\nIn all, this record is a huge disappointment. I was a good album. It was creative, genuinely heavy more often than not, had creative writing and playing despite it being '''random''' and wasn't a bad listen overall. This, on the other-hand, was. Repetitive playing, dull and uninspired writing, and it takes over half of the album to get somewhere that is kind of fun to listen to. Again, I forgot about the lyrics. They aren't bad, but could be better. Almost kind of ripping off I. Bad mixing, bad use of instruments, and pretty much a blatant rip-off of I if I'm being perfectly honest. Only listen if you feel like it.\n",
        "\nThis is actually something I like past Meshuggah's shithole that is known as Nothing. It is an awful album with the only redeemable features being Jens and Tomas. This time, though, I kinda like it. It is definitely something else, a 21 minute song compiled from random riffs during practice sessions, at least from what I know and have read about it. It is fast, chaotic, and genuinely heavy at some points without the total reliance of the top two strings. Good production, creative and honestly random solos, superb drumming by Fredrik, this is the Meshuggah that I wish was, but is unfortunately not due to a seemingly endless fixation on the whole \"djent\" thing.\n\nJesus Christ Jens, those are the vocals I like to hear from you, totally harsh and going all over your range with pained screams and growls of the devil. His vocals really shine on this record, giving me a feel of Chaosphere two releases back. His intro scream by far is my most favorite part vocally. He really went all in with the nostalgia factor, keeping me hooked until the next time he let out another of those pained, yet mechanical cries. But, Jens really didn't though, which kinda upset me. I was ready for it, then I got blue-balled. Total let down Jens. \n\nInstrumentation is superior to Nothing in every-way possible. One thing that really surprised me was seeing Dick on this record. At the time, he was only the touring bassist, but it looks like he was accepted into the band at this time, then he wasn't, as after this, he is not credited as being on Catch Thirtythree. But, in all honesty, I believe Dick was able to bring Meshuggah out of the djent hole that the last record was, at least for a little while anyways. We'll get to that point when we need to. Besides that, Fredrik, Marten, and Dick provide amazing riffage throughout the track, really bringing them out of the binary bullshit for a breath of fresh air, even if it was for only a little while. There is still too much reliance on the top two strings, but it is not nearly as bad as Nothing. I know that I am hating on that record a lot, but I detest it. Tomas' drumming is fucking amazing, and provides some insane beats, especially in the first seven minutes of the track, totally pounding the fuck out of his bass drums. \n\nProduction is also quite superior to the last album. The guitars have a perfect mix of mid and treble, while being bassy as all hell. The bass is super apparent and easily heard, kind of reminiscent to Destroy Erase Improve actually. The drums are a little to quiet, especially the cymbals and toms, being quite muffled. The bass drums are still apparent, which is always an improvement. My biggest gripe with the drums is Tomas' snare. It really has a \"tock tock tock\" sound to it that I cannot understand why it was used. At least it isn't St. Anger levels of \"I want to die it's so bad.\" Jens vocals, on the other hand, are mixed to perfection, not being so loud that it is overpowering the instruments, yet not so quiet that they are muffled by the rest of the instruments. Who mixed this recor-.. Fredrik, I owe you an apology. You can be a good mixer. \n\nThe lyrics are damn intriguing. They are very self exploratory, and not of the average person. It is kind of like if a god from Lovecraft's universe became a psychonaut and just secluded itself in its room for all of existence, going down further into itself. I really don't know, I'm no shrink. \n\nSo, overall, the fact that Meshuggah was able to pull themselves together and produce this terrifyingly heavy experiment bewilders me. It went from shitty, slow riffs with monotonous playing, to a non-euclidean travel into the mind, exploring the self. Good vocals by Jens, fun and intriguing playing by Fredrik, Marten, and Dick, with absolutely monstrous playing by Tomas, I is a far cry from what the band became, with overused and simplistic playing, garbage vocals due to age, and the only thing consistent being Tomas' playing. If you want to go down a nostalgia hole, listen to this. I recommend.\n",
        "\nBefore I have a mental breakdown in writing this, I need to say something, I could not finish listening to this record, I really couldn't. I got to the third to last song, then I had to be done. I could not take this piece of shit seriously. I really don't know why the guys at Meshuggah Co. couldn't keep the sound of Chaosphere, but they HaD tO gO dEePeR. This is really one of the reasons why I cannot listen to Meshuggah anymore, because of this shitty ass sound that everyone thinks is great. It is absolute garbage. The only people that really improved with this change is Jens and Tomas, but only Tomas is the one that has kept the momentum up. Jens lost his voice, Fredrik and Marten fell into the downward spiral of binary and random fucking solos, and Dick, well, he is unremarkable. Now, onto the content of this shitty record. \n\nTo begin with, Jens isn't all too bad on this record, and this is the voice he really stuck with after Chaosphere. I will admit, he does somewhat accentuate the albums \"heaviness,\" but with his low range and lack of high screams like on the previous two records, I really can't defend him all to much. It is obviously clear by this point with Meshuggah that they didn't want to change from this shitty fucking sound. It really makes me wish that Jens and Tomas had jumped ship when it started to flood, but here we are, 31 years later and full of stagnation. Maybe they will jump one day. \n\nFuck this record's writing. It is dull, repetitive, and makes me wish I didn't spend a good hour of my life trying to listen to this piece of shit. From the garbage ass solos, to trying to be fast and heavy with songs like \"Straws Pulled At Random,\" of which is the only decent song on the album, and \"Perpetual Black Second,\" everything is absolute garbage. Poor solo work by both Fredrik and Marten with lackluster riffs to accompany the shit flinging, no tracks have something truly good. Tomas is okay on this record, I guess. It isn't anything like the mechanized chaos of Choasphere or Destroy Erase Improve, more reminiscent of Contradictions Collapse. I guess the only tracks he are good on are \"Glints Collide,\" \"Spasm,\" and \"Straws Pulled At Random.\" Also, Fredrik cannot play bass for shit. He fucking sucks, enough said. \n\nI know that I have said that I hate this record, but I especially hate the fucking production. It is absolutely awful, like diarrhea used as frosting on the shit cake that this record is. Hey! Whoever mixed this record, you're a poopy head! Want me to spell it out for you? Y o u a r e a p o o p y h e a d. I think it was Fredrik actually. So, Fredrik, if you are looking at this, refer to the above for my grievances about how shitty of a producer you are. It also doesn't help that the guitars were recorded on a SINGLE FUCKING PROTOTYPE. Or maybe it was two, I don't really know and don't really fucking care. Just a point of reference, if you want to record a record using a new kind of guitar, FUCKING PERFECT IT FIRST YOU INSUFFERABLE CUNTS. Anyways, the guitars are way to bassy (no shit sherlock), the bass cannot be heard for anything, and the drums are super quiet. Also, Fredrik, if you truly mixed this album, make your fucking vocalists vocals not overpower your shitty playing. \n\nLyrics are typical Meshuggah, in writing and execution. Despite this records slow pace, Jens can spit out vocals at quite a good rate. Anyways, I refuse to analyze anymore of this turd than I already have. It's just more corn kernels, pieces of seeds, and some blood. Don't forget the watery diarrhea! I refuse to finish this review in a normal manner. I can't. It is just more of the same shit OVER AND OVER AGAIN! It never ends!\n",
        "\nWith the binary soon to flow like diarrhea out of an orphan, we need to talk about the Swede's last true great record, one that is, in my opinion, the best Meshuggah record. Faster tempo, harsher vocals, heavy without using 8 strings and a new bassist, Chaosphere is the last, and greatest Meshuggah. Truly heavy. \n\nTo begin, I need to talk about Tomas real quick, and just applaud his rise to one of the most technical drummers I have ever heard. He's a very fuckin fast drummer that should be respected. So, as a last note before the binary shitstorm that Meshuggah became with Nothing, he is one of the few things I look forward to whenever I listen to a Meshuggah record. Now, to the actual content of the record.\n\nJens hasn't really changed much since Meshuggah's sophomore record, Destroy Erase Improve. He is a really good vocalist that can scream like a motherfucker. His highs on tracks like \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\" honestly give me chills, as they sound as if a god has entered his body as he let out those screams, and then left to fuck off somewhere else. His midrange, or the growl as I should say, is used throughout the majority of the record. It has a really cool, almost mechanical vibe to it that he unfortunately lost with time, as do all great vocalist. For me, his best performances are on \"Sane,\" \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ,\" and \"Corridor of Chameleons.\"\n\nHey Fredrik, and Marten I guess, thank you guys for taking out some ingredients from the creative department before they went stale! This album is really fun to listen to, and the creative use of solos being overlayed with the main riff is super cool, giving Chaosphere a really cool, almost alien, sound. It has a dreamy quality to it, if the dreams were created by an evil alien machine. The drone to some of the notes really does sound like parts of a super computer searching its files for the best way to exterminate us, and the guitars really do sound like gears and cogs turning at variable speeds, independent of each other. A new bassist means a new style of playing, and Gustaf is quite good, being creative in providing a backing line that helps keep the band together. Again, Tomas is absolutely superb on the record, being a huge driving force throughout, keeping Fredrik, Marten, Gustaf, and Jens on wits end about when the next insane drum part is going to start. Good job Tomas! One thing before I end the songwriting portion, the ending of \"Elastic\" is bewildering and absolutely insane. It really isn't something that can be described. I believe that it is a mashup of all the songs, but I have no fucking clue. It honestly sounds like machinery with multiple gravel gremlins screaming at the top of their lungs about something... I don't know. \n\nThe production of the record is absolutely superb to all that would come, and all that had come. Jens vocals are mixed perfectly and aren't to loud or quiet, taking up as much space as the drums, bass, and guitars. Speaking of which, this album is the last before the djent shitstorm that was to come, and I can smell the metal hipsters with their payloads of \"MeShUgGaH iS tHe HeAvIeSt BaNd EvEr!!!!!1!!!\" With that said, based on the production value, it is unfortunately the tipping point for the band into an awful sound, and they fell HARD. Besides all that, the guitars are very mechanical in tone throughout the record, with the bass being especially chunky, really getting to the djent phase that I am really dreading getting into. But, it works on this record. It is a fast, relentless record with little room for pause, and that really keeps away the djent feel, for now. \n\nNow, with all that being said, Meshuggah's Chaosphere is the last good, and best, of their entire discography, being fast, relentless and heavy at the same time, with few moments of peace only to be interrupted with chaotic solos and, for lack of a better phrase, mechanical guitars that grind away at you. Jens vocals only accentuate the mechanical despair on the record, truly being cold. Creative guitar work and batshit insane solos really keep up the tone of pure chaos. I forgot to talk about the lyrics! A brief synopsis: A human turns itself into a machine and has multiple identity crises. There ya go. Anyways, if you want to listen to something heavy without 'djentahrreah' pouring into your ears, listen to this record.\n",
        "\nBefore the release of this record, Meshuggah wasn't anymore than a proto-extreme technical thrash band, but this record ABSOLUTELTY throws them into true extreme metal. Every cool quirk from the last record was taken and amplified so much that it bewilders me that the guys over here at Meshuggah Co. could produce such a \"heavy\" record without using those 8 strings. My first time listening to this record had me totally blown away, and in listening to it again, I am still blown away by it. Genuinely heavy, improved vocals, better guitar and bass work, and the rise of Tomas Haake, Destroy Erase Improve is a sound and style that should have been kept by the Swedes. \n\nYes Jens, this is a proper metal voice! No more shouting, just a voice full of gravel and psychonautic, mechanized lyrics to spew out to the world. With this, Jens really solidified how he would sound in the future. All that would happen is his voice would get harsher and deeper. For me, his best has to be from the opening song, \"Future Breed Machine.\" It is a br00tal song with some forceful lyric spitting from Jens. His high end scream has improved quite a lot over the five year period, along with his lows. \"Inside What's Within Behind\" also has some great vocals from Jens. Overall, Jens has improved a lot from the last record. I am glad he kept up the improvement. \n\nNow, songwriting is beginning to suffer from relying on low notes, but it isn't to the level that records like Nothing or obZen suffered from, thank god. There is definitely some creative riffage, like on, again, \"Future Breed Machine.\" \"Soul Burn\" has the most apparent use of low notes to create a heavy riff, but I need to remark on the solo, because it is ABSOLUTELY mesmerizing. It shows that Fredrik can be a creative player, with some almost punk-esque feel to the random solo work. Speaking of which, what dumbass thought it was a good idea to leave that solo on the end of \"Beneath?\" It is really bad, and takes away a lot from the song. Marten has some pretty creative guitar work as well, but soon falls, like everyone else, into the binary trap of later Meshuggah. Peter's bass is becoming not as creative, and slowly falling into the binary spiral as well. Now this is the Tomas Haake that I have become used to. He begins to play some cool fills in between riffs like on \"Vanished,\" and some really fast playing like on \"Beneath\" and, again, \"Future Breed Machine.\" It just shows that he is a genuinely good drummer. \n\nThe mixing is totally superior to Contradictions Collapse, the bass not being as loud, the guitars being quite disgusting, and Tomas' kit being damn good. With the last record, the bass was WAY too loud, and I'm a guy who likes a lot of bass. On this record, the bass is still quite audible, but not to the level of the last record. The guitars have a more gritty feel and sound, being quite good. My only gripe is with Tomas' kit, its quite muffled all around. The cymbals and snare are quiet, the toms don't have a lot of bottom to them, and the bass drums are the only thing I can kinda hear clearly. \n\nAgain, Meshuggah has always had a way with words, literally. Besides \"Future Breed Machine,\" the rest of the lyrics off the record are very self exploratory, talking a lot about the mind and exploring how it may or may not work. There are quite the amount, and they are quite cool to read to people saying that metal only talks about the negative. Now that may be true for most bands, but reading a lot of Meshuggah lyrics, you tend to find a lot of metaphors and mental exploration. Let them read some of those lyrics and join the absolute bandwagon of acid poppers that listen to bands like Meshuggah. Yeah I have no clue what I said either.\n\nBesides that stroke I just had, Destroy Erase Improve is an excellent Meshuggah record some may see as the pinnacle of their career before their downward spiral into binary. I don't agree, as I think Chaosphere is their last \"pinnacle\" record. Anyways, this record has some much improved vocals from Jens Kidman, and continuing to improve with time. Tomas also make a MASSIVE improvement from the last record, becoming much more technical and less reserved. Fredrik, Marten, and Peter all have some creative parts on the record but are slowly becoming reliant on the lower strings to become \"HeAvY.\" You can be heavy without needing 8 damn strings or being tuned an octave down. Production is quite good besides Tomas' kit, of which is way to quiet, and the lyrics are just as strong from when they began. Not a bad record.\n",
        "\nAh Meshuggah, the fathers of the abortion known as djent. The only good thing about this genre is it is extremely laughable. I probably laugh more listening to djent than anything else. Having stated that, Contradictions Collapse is not the worst record out there. In fact, for technical thrash, this is actually a pretty fun record to listen to. Some creative solo work, pretty cool lyricism, and genuinely heavy moments without those shitty breakdowns. If you are looking for some genuinely fun thrash from the 90s, try Contradictions Collapse. \n\nTo begin this inevitable downward spiral into 11100101010111000101010, I need to remark on Jens Kidman's vocal style, or lack thereof. If I want to listen to some genuine 'shout metal,' I'll just pull up some Pantera and listen to \"Piss\" over and over again. Yes, that is who Jens reminds me of on this record, Phil Anselmo. Now, it needs to be said that Jens gets so much better over the course of binary spiral, I just wish he had jumped the Meshuggah shit-ship and started a death band. That being said, his vocal style actually accompanies this record's kind of old-school feel. It is like the hate-to-love it thing, it's so obviously bad but it accompanies the record so well. Besides that, he can actually hold up his 'screams' pretty well. On \"Erroneous Manipulation,\" more specifically towards the end, Jens lets out quite the 'scream.' Not bad for shouting. \n\nNow, song writing isn't the worst, yet it isn't the best. It is reminiscent of Sepultura from the Chaos A.D. and Roots era, which is really off putting. However, it is not as blatantly boring as Sepultura from that time period. There is some creative solo work from I assume Fredrik and maybe some from Jens. One of my favorite solos definitely has to be from \"We'll Never See the Day,\" a heavy song with a chaotic solo. \"Cadaverous Mastication\" is also a great track which originally came from their highly underrated self-titled EP. If you want some really early proto extreme metal, listen to that EP. Peter's playing is very, very good, providing a simple, yet effective, backing to the guitars. It is always nice to hear something not to overtly complicated yet not to simplistic. Now, Tomas Haake, the man, the legend. In all honesty, he is just your average drummer on this record, but he does become much more technical with time, of which I can always look forward to, even if it is on some awful records. \n\nThe mixing on this record is so classic of that early extreme metal sound. It is middy and bassy, with not all to much treble. Jens and Fredrik's guitars are honestly amazing. They have a very dirty industrial feel, almost like re bar covered in grease is being played. Peter's bass is mixed very heavily, and is exceptionally loud, almost overpowering the guitars in some spots. Kind of off putting, but it is nice to actually hear the bass loud and clear. Both the guitars and bass have a chug feel to them, not a djent feel, yet. Tomas' kit actually amazing. It has a lot of hollowness to it. The snare and drums fall and echo, the cymbals clash and ring out, and the double bass is absolutely pounding. Jens' vocals take up a little to much space, but it isn't awful. \n\nOne thing I will always give credit to Meshuggah is they are pretty damn good at writing lyrics. This time around, they are quite focused on the self and others, but also somewhat apocalyptic. The only song that has not so good lyrics is the second track, \"Erroneous Manipulation.\" Scratch that, they are absolutely absurd. There is a lot of animal imagery in the lyrics, but it seems really haphazardly written. One especially dumb line is 'Farting magazines are wading in waxed scarecrows.' I know that a lot of Meshuggah songs are metaphors for something, but tell me, in god's name please tell me what the actual fuck that means. Other than that enigma, \"Abnegating Cecity\" has really damn good lyrics. From what I can read, it may or may not be about heroin. I genuinely don't know, but it points more in favor of being about the opiate. \n\nOverall, Meshuggah's first outing with a record is not all to bad. It isn't the downward spiral of 1010101001010101101010 that the band became, but more of a fun trip down a proto extreme metal, technical thrash route that is overall a really fun listening experience. Vocals are not the best on the planet for very obvious reasons, but Jens does improve as time goes on. Songwriting is not the greatest on the planet, but it is kind of fun and genuinely heavy in some parts, like on \"Erroneous Manipulation\" and \"Cadaverous Mastication.\" The solo work by Fredrik and maybe Jens is pretty good, Peter's bass playing is damn good, and Tomas has yet to hit his absolute pinnacle. The mixing is pretty grimy, almost industrial in some aspects. The lyrics are not all to bad either, but they could have used some work. Not a bad record before the binary shitstorm.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah have never been a band to make things easy, either for themselves or their listeners. First of all, there\u2019s the name, taken from the Yiddish language; next, the baffling technical time signatures that have been in their sound since the new millennium; finally, chaotic, morphic songs that deal with curiously rigid - even formal - subjects, as with their latest offering, The Violent Sleep of Reason. This one picks up where 2012's Koloss left off, implementing themes of mechanized technology, the structuralism of the city, and troubling scope into their shuddering grooves. \n\nMusically, this is not a far cry from the Swedes\u2019 previous work, Tomas Haake laying down polyrhythms like some heavy metal Vishnu, the guitarists drowning us in treacle-thick downtuned riffage, while Jens Kidman roars out in his monotonous bark to narrate discomforting truths about our world. Some of these songs tend towards drier, more rhythmic workouts, while others like 'By the Ton' add in plenty of the elastic groove that gave djent bands like Meshuggah a name for their sound. Since this style of music has always been divisive at best, it would be difficult to claim that The Violent Sleep of Reason will persuade any new fans over to the cause, though the technical exhibitionism shown during 'Clockworks' and the title track prove that no one else is threatening Meshuggah's status as leaders in their field. Then again, the album seems to become freer as it goes on, 'Ivory Tower' and 'Stifled' making up a strong mid-album stint of more memorable riffing and an eerie, soothing outro to the latter song.\n\nThe true worth of this album thus depends a lot on whether Meshuggah is a band that you can feel excited by or whether their technicality and abstruseness leaves you cold. On a positive note for The Violent Sleep of Reason, there is atmosphere to be found on certain songs, growing with the use of keyboards on closer 'Into Decay' into part of the album\u2019s legacy. On the other hand, there are moments too when the rhythmic demolition might appear all too soulless, not helped by the single fearsome dimension of Kidman\u2019s voice. Either way, there is plenty of power contained in the hour of music on offer.\n\n\nOriginally written for Metalegion #3 - www.metalegion.com\n",
        "\nIf there's a museum for things that are praised far beyond the level of admiration they deserve, Meshuggah is destined to some day be immortalized there between exhibits about the Black Keys (the first band to ever imbue rock with bluesy characteristics, if you ask their more rabid fans) and Beyonce (who practically everyone in the world seems to view as the second coming of Christ and some kind of feminist superhero rolled into one). There's a weird misconception that this band is revolutionary because of the oddball rhythms it applies to what is essentially groove metal. Not only is this a wrong assertion, but Meshuggah's insistence on loading their own music down with tough guy posturing, provided by the angry caveman providing vocals on Obzen, takes something that was overrated to begin with and makes it genuinely unbearable. \n\nAll the people out there who gush about how progressive Meshuggah\u2019s use of strange time signatures makes the group whilst sprouting a boner at the mere thought of any of their albums need to shut the fuck up because all Meshuggah\u2019s approach to music ever accomplished was making them sound like an off-kilter Pantera. That's right, for all their skill in being able to keep up with their own weird time signatures and polyrhythms, all that work ever amounts to is a bunch of songs that sound like 'A New Level' being played out of its proper sequence. The grooves at the heart of this album are incredibly repetitive and seem to be made of two or three notes each, which makes the monotony horribly obvious no matter how the band tries to cover up this fact by playing them in 9/328.44445 time or positioning them next to some wonky drum patterns. And whether the tempo is slow or fast, you can count on whatever Meshuggah\u2019s rhythm section is playing to sound mechanical and utterly devoid of emotion, contrast (even on the occasional moments where they slow down or attempt to go a bit softer) and inspiration. The band\u2019s goal of taking something heavy, slamming, and primal and reconfiguring it to add a degree of sophistication is admirable and these Swedish bruisers are quite skilled at keeping track of several crazy time signatures at once, but their effort and talent just don't produce anything all that interesting or invigorating. \n\nWhile the sort of groove noodling (groodling?) Meshuggah delivers doesn't exactly hurt to listen to, vocalist Jens Kidman does. Have you ever been to a biker bar in the middle of Arizona, the kind that plays loud rock music and smells like a cigar shop after it fucked a garbage dump filled with sweaty clothes people wore to the gym, and listened to those tattooed, leather-wearing meathead biker dudes get in an argument and scream at each other for a minute before whipping out their brass knuckles and switchblades? Well, Kidman's singing sounds exactly like that sort of yelling. While the same complaint could be leveled at Phil Anselmo, Phil at least always seems interested in working with whatever band he's in, singing in a way that fits with the music his bandmates are playing. Kidman's only goal seems to be overpowering the music by shouting as loudly as he can, except in 'Dancers to a Discordant System', where he frequently makes use of a quieter and more disciplined rasp. He must have been worried that the complicated nature of the grooves and drumbeats might take some of the spotlight away from him so he sought to correct that any way he could. Sadly, this means double doses of aspirin for me, because his approach to singing is just to bludgeon the shit out of everyone, including his bandmates, with all the subtlety and finesse of a wrecking ball.\n\nI could dwell on ObZen\u2019s production, which positions the instruments so they all have prominence without the mix sounding cluttered, but gives Jens a goddamn bullhorn so he can overwhelm the rest of the band whenever he opens his mouth, but when the music is this stale and the vocalist so intent on making his listeners suffer, do you even want me to bother with that? \n\nIn closing (because I really want to get this over with so I can turn this damn album off and forget about it), ObZen is an exercise in masochism. A bad singer doesn't necessarily ruin the band they're in but Kidman's headache-inducing caveman shouting is an inexcusable offense. While I wish the odd grooving patterns the band employs used more notes and had more diversity to them (some of these songs, including the 7-minute 'Bleed', are built mostly on one riff), they aren't awful. An album with an odd idea that gets boring fast was the best case scenario here. Meshuggah, wrongly figuring that infuriating was better than boring, gave Kidman free reign to yell and scream in a fit of artless aggression that flushes away most of this album's value. To use a metaphor as subtle and dignified as Kidman's performance, just imagine that Meshuggah's rhythm section is a decent cake and Kidman is a guy jumping onto the table and dropping his pants to take a shit on it.\n",
        "\nThe Sleep of Reason is an etching by Francisco Goya, Spanish artist of the late 18th / early 19th century. It depicts a man sitting down at a table with his head resting on his arms asleep with bats, owls & other baddies flying above. Meshuggah was formed in '88 and this late into their career they are still trying to dig out of their smudged history. Released in 2016 Violent Sleep of Reason may be a metaphoric title as perhaps a little rest allowed the Swedish stalwarts to rekindle some of their origins by getting rid of some of the bats in the belfry. What I mean is that there's a little less djent aspects and more death/thrash elements. \n\nEver since the invention and subsequent implementation of the infamous 8th guitar string, Meshuggah's sound went from a standard death/thrash tone quality to this massive bassy throbbing dirge. Enter: DJENT. The only song that is stylistically this, in it's entirely, is the mind-numbing downward spiral of dejected diarrhea that is 'Ivory Tower.' Luckily this obligatory slowness is tucked in just past halfway and the rest of the recordings are examples of a Meshuggah somewhat reawakened. Opening track 'Clockworks' begins strong in this aspect and sets the tone for what's left to come on this, their 9th album in 30 years.\n\n'Born in Dissonance' the album's 2nd and shortest track & provides some tight palm-muted chords reaching higher octaves than most songs here and would rank among the best on this opus. It's is helped out by Throdendal's best licks here with the fretboard-wide noodlings that contain his dry, digitally stuttered notes like an orgy of R2D2s on too many little blue pills. 'Nostrum' and 'Our Rage Won't Die' also offer up more energetic and bouncy rhythms, giving pause to listeners wanting more of the old, less of the new. However the latter is very repetitive; the first half of the song continues its fast syncopation ad nauseum and then the remaining two minutes result in a dragged-out djent breakdown with these flickering guitar scrapes similar to the brief tapping exercise at beginning of 'By the Ton' yet offering no help in making the song any better. 'By the Ton', by the way, is more of the same: A six-minute disastrously djent dirge.\n\nHaake is still the mind behind what's within and inside penning (90% of) the lyrics once more. Introverted outside perspectives on man and machine, diatribes against time. There's a few passages about breaking from the grip of modernity and flying free & he even touches on religious topics from an obfuscated distance. Vocally, I regret to inform you that you can expect nothing less than what Jens' been peddling since day one. I guess it works and as the old adage goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Ultimately, I'm not sure what I expected anyway...maybe something more along the lines of 'Sane' or 'Corridor of Chameleons' perhaps. His vocals this time around a not the focal point and are far from impactful.\n\nThey have had an undulating career thus far, starting off as thrash with a ton of experimentation then fell off the rails due to technology. Now they're climbing out from under the pile of circuitry in an attempt to recapture something more abrasive. If you are a devout follower of the Swedes, then by all means, continue your undying love and support. But I am left wanting more.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah have gone in the direction of adding more and more weight to their sounds as of late, This was represented by Koloss going for a much slower, and heavier atmospheric sound. They goes more or less in the same direction with The Violent Sleep of Reason, though this album has significantly more bounce to it than Koloss did. It seems as though Meshuggah were starting to sense that they were dragging more than usual on Koloss and decided to bring some energy back into the mix. What resulted was an album that improves on its predecessor's faults, but not by very much, and only brings a little bit to the table on terms of truly delicious songs. Meshuggah really hasn't changed all that much, but The Violent Sleep of Reason does offer something weighty and roughly in-between the sluggish sounds of Koloss, and the punchier and more aggressive ObZen.\n\nIf you've heard other Meshuggah albums, you likely already know what you're in for. This is a big, loud album full of down-tuned mechanical guitar grooves in odd time signatures with Jens Kidman's growls over them. There's a decent bounce to the music this time around with the grooves pushing more of their weight around. Though, they may be mechanical, they are also, extremely dense and chaotic with a lot of the energy on this album coming from the sheer weight of the grooves. The songs on here have more momentum than on Koloss, but not to an extreme degree. Few are particularly catchy or memorable. Some songs like \"Monstrocity\" and \"Our Rage Won't Die\" kick things off with a real punch from the get-go and stand out as the best pieces on here. The reason they do so is because they get to the point, and give us their best riffs up-front. Other songs like \"Nostrum\" are punishing ragers, but take a long time to really get started up. Buildup is fine, but a lot of it is just simple guitar grooves with the heavy tuning providing tension. Meshuggah had a lot of decent ideas for grooves on this album, but a lot of these ideas are spread out too much, and many songs tend to sit on a riff with rigid momentum, not to the same extent as Koloss, but definitely about as much as Nothing. This album is thick and weighty, but could really be bothered to pick things up, be more dynamic, and take less of it's sweet time building up and actually get to crushing.\n\nAs far as how I feel about this album, I'm of a pretty middling attitude. Meshuggah delivers more of their signature sound, but only goes so far as to make something that's just okay. It's crushing, brutish, and super-dense, but it's also just okay as far as the songs and riffs actually go. It's another bare-bones album, the musical bones are thicker this time around, but they are still laid bare. There's just not enough to enthrall someone when all you have to offer is thick walls of dense guitars where only a few of your riffs really have that \"oomph\" needed to hook you in. There just isn't enough variety in the grooves to fill up the 6 and 7-minute song lengths and make them totally worth it. The songs tend to feel like big, thick bricks of sound and only rely on their weight to keep the momentum going. If you are looking for pure heaviness, and pure heaviness only, this is an album that will work for you. For the rest of us, there's some decent grooves and a lot of really punishing and chaotic atmosphere, but there's also a lot of weight that's not being pushed as hard as it could. In order to have impact, you have to give that weight some momentum, and there is only a bit here.\n\nAs far as Meshuggah albums go, this one doesn't stick out to me as much as the others. It feels a lot like Nothing, but with a bit more added weight. I'm thankful it isn't as plodding as Koloss, and there are some positively destructive songs on here. However, a lot of this album feels like its just they're just re-treading ground they've already covered and aren't really pushing themselves anymore. Am I asking that they go make a fucking rock opera? Hell no. But I would like some more catchy, breakneck songs, with the weight, impact, and groovy punch that made Meshuggah so great. As an album, this is a satisfactory if underwhelming venture. I do give them some props for bringing the bounce back, I just want them to do more with it, maybe make their songs a little less monotone too. There are some good ideas on here, just pack them tighter, and give them more force to improve. This is fine, but Meshuggah should really come with more mania next time.\n",
        "\nWhat happens when you take ObZen, then increase the repetition, and remove a lot of the speed, you get Koloss. Yes, this album is one of the Meshuggah albums I'm not a fan of. It has it's grooves here and there, and they're certainly heavy, they just lack a lot of the force and activity we saw on ObZen. This appears to be Meshuggah trying to go back towards the \"atmospheric\" stylings of their early-mid 2000's material, but with ObZen's song-centric approach. The songs on here are bigger and fatter-sounding than before, but somehow don't do nearly as much to enthuse, or engage. They follow a more \"hypnotic\" method rather than a punchy, violent headbanging method, and that is much harder to get into, or even enjoy due to the fact that a lot of it lacks momentum. Koloss is just disappointing to me.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that all of these songs are very flat in their delivery. Sure, you can easily tell them apart, but the only song that I can remember that had enough punch not to feel boring was \"Marrow\", which is the most spring-loaded song on this album. Everything else ran the gamut from dry and forgettable, to sluggish and droning. I keep thinking the same thing I did with Nothing, but to a greater degree, some increased speed would help this along much more. \"Break Those Bones\" would be so much better if it just went at a faster pace. The subtle progressions are there, but it's too slow and subtle for a song that's almost seven minutes long. Then there's also the problem of many songs which just drone on, using the same groove, and rarely, if ever picking it up and changing their rhythm. The faster songs are even similarly flat and plodding. Some songs don't even pick up at all, just sitting there with none of this album's massive weight doing anything. It just sits on one groove and doesn't go anywhere, like a morbidly obese guy in a broken Wal-mart scooter. The technicality and poly-rhythms can only dazzle me for so long unless you actually do something with them. The anger on here is also much less convincing without some motion to it, it just feels like a cloud of stress sitting over you. This is not an album to look for if you were expecting an ObZen style battering.\n\nThere are passages that feel positively blistering for all of thirty seconds, only to maintain that and never change. That is my biggest problem with this album. There is potential for something good on here, but often it gets so oversimplified and sluggish that I can't bring myself to feel anything while this is going on. There are crushing, bouncy grooves in \"Demiurge\" and \"Do Not Look Down\", but these songs don't have much more to offer than the grooves themselves and are very simple and bare-bones. The monotony makes this feel longer than it should. There are some psychedelic and hypnotic moments that do work for building an atmosphere of thickness and dread more so than motion. I guess this is tolerable for tense and crushing background music, but aside from that, I don't see myself getting much use out of Koloss. I can get better ambiance from an actual ambient album. This is heavy, but also just plodding, underdeveloped, and stale. There were so many things that almost worked that this had good potential, but ultimately it ended up becoming a drag.\n\nThis was not a decent follow-up to ObZen. Where that album gave us some chaotic, obliterating, and punchy songs, this doesn't. They are so much less developed and basic despite having a similar aura of apocalyptic heaviness. It's just that such an aura and a few grooves need energy and a kick if they want to form a decent song. Koloss is sorely lacking in that. There's some decent pieces of these songs on here. Maybe if they had arranged them differently and in a more sporadic and less repetitive fashion, perhaps this could have turned out better, but alas, this was just boring.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah's progression is a curious thing. When they tried to make an album with one massive song consuming the whole thing on Catch Thirtythree, they produced something ambitious, but ultimately agonizing and too monolithic for its own good. The album that they'd follow that up with, ObZen is a return to a faster, chunkier, and more song-focused approach. This is a welcome return to form from these legendary poly-rhythmic punishers who do their job best when that job is pummeling you with grooves that are as weighty and chaotic as getting run over by a speeding tank. They put a lot more aggression into these songs, creating a round of real stompers and neck-breakers for people who like their metal chunky and brutish. This album brings the thrashier and groovier aspects that made their 90's releases so menacing, and gives it a weightier sound and mixes in a bit of their nerve-warping atmospheric tendencies displayed on Nothing to make a potent, pounding blend of precision beatdowns that would prove to be very influential with future djenters and groove-hounds alike, that being ObZen.\n\nThis is an album that takes the more hypnotic and repetitive sounds of old and injects a healthy amount of chaos into it. The main draw of ObZen is simply just how much they take the crushing, weighty, brutish, groovy sounds of old and give them so much more mass and energy this time around. The sounds on this album play out like a battle between massive robots destroying everything around. Not only does this album sound big and destructive, the music inside does a lot to back it up. The odd time signatures make the pulse of ObZen engaging, enraged, and robust. I can also say that while ObZen is angrier than previous albums, it\u2019s also bouncier and punchier. It\u2019s done in an engaging fashion, too. With that being said, ObZen is a hard album to get into, but bringing yourself a step closer to obscene Zen is worth the sweet audial punishment.\n\nObZen is an album full of pulverizing rhythms in low tuning with an aura of thick, brazen anger that uses the guitar like an automatic weapon, unloading massive riff volleys into your ears. I\u2019m thankful for the increased speed on this album, that gives Meshuggah the energy needed to avoid becoming boring. \u201cCombustion\u201d, \u201cBleed\u201d, and \u201cObZen\u201d are the tracks that are the catchiest and crunchiest out of everything on here and are good windows into what the rest of this album holds for you. The title-track does a great job of switching riffs while maintaining its signature mosh-pounding. Kidman\u2019s semi-intelligible roaring, the bendy grooves, and the faint tremolo under the chug riffs in the opening add a truckload of suspense to the robotic pulverizing going on with the rhythm. Songs like that are the golden streaks in Meshuggah\u2019s circuit board, as well as the thrashy and previously-mentioned \u201cCombustion\u201d which bellows like a mechanized monster and mixes the punchiness in with thrash sensibilities. There are slower parts of this album that take more influence from Nothing, but even these are far angrier, bouncier, and groovier than most of the material off that album. As a whole package, there\u2019s enough might on display to make ObZen into a riling, obliterative experience.\n\nIf you thought the heaviness of the early 2000\u2019s Meshuggah had potential, but miss the catchiness and speed of the 90\u2019s Meshuggah, then ObZen is right for you. It puts them together in a way that pounds, punches, and crushes. It\u2019s a satisfying barrage of beatings courtesy of everyone involved in the band. This album is very lively, and it makes its points while beating you senseless with bone-crushing grooves and a very palpable sense of rage and fury. Meshuggah released one of the heaviest albums of their career with this. Granted, there are some songs that don\u2019t do as much as they could, like \u201cPineal Gland Optics\u201d which is just kind of there and doesn\u2019t carry much momentum, but the album as a whole, and so many individual tracks off of it are just as punishing as being rained on by hammers and wrenches. If you want music perfect for slugging it out with automatons and blasting out thick waves of groovy dissonance, Meshuggah\u2019s ObZen fits the bill.\n",
        "\nThere are plenty of reasons why I'm much nicer towards I than I am towards its close sonic relative, Catch Thirtythree. One of those reasons is that there's more activity, another is that there's more variety, another is that this makes my head want to bob rather than split into agonizing pain, and one final one is probably because it's shorter and thus, there's less padding. The EP is much better suited to these \"whole album is one song\" affairs than a full-length is. It allows them to get their ideas out and develop a cohesive song without having to plod or pad as much. This is Meshuggah we're talking about, so the guitars, vocals, bass, and drums are all we have to work with. They're a pretty groove-centered band, and their style of progressive metal is more skeletal and rigid than most others, so you can't expect them to break out a keyboard interlude or something as hilariously out-of-place as that. They need to keep up with their style which is rocky, solid, stern, and heavy, and they do reasonably well at putting that style into this winding, one song EP.\n\nWhat we see here is kind of like the structure of Catch Thirtythree minus the monotony, and plus a bit of the steel-hard crunch that we'd later hear on ObZen. The pace here is considerably more manic and more fight-worthy than the meandering black hole of boredom that was Catch Thirtythree. Yes, the first minute and a half of I sounds like the intro to Anthrax's song \"Time\", but that's where any similarities to other prior acts ends. Despite the later riffs being mostly djenty, mechanical chugs, they feel like a torrent on this EP, coming in waves to crush whatever lay ahead of them. They are lively, stimulating, complex, and usually only stay around as long as needed before changing. The drums are also probably the most intense instrument on this album as Tomas Haake makes it sound like it's literally raining bullets and scrap metal in destructive volleys. I also like how much faster a tempo this has, as this is mostly composed of fast, chunky volleys that remind me more of \"Future Breed Machine\" or \"Combustion\" than of \"Stengah\". It even uses some trippy clean notes as a bridge later on, and it feels deeper and denser than they've done before. The sound is big at all times, even during softer parts like that. They want to let you know you're listening to an unholy, gear-grinding giant of a song.\n\nI'd have to say that Meshuggah's experiment with a long, EP-consuming song is commendable, since the music inside actually sounds like a deliciously punishing affair. This grinds and crushes while rarely feeling bloated or belabored. It shows off a nice mixture of creativity and aggression. This is also more of a return to form with the grooves being as destructive and forceful as an artillery barrage. It's tense, punchy, imposing, and monstrous as Meshuggah should be. It's grinding and grating, but in a good way. The kind of way that makes you want to come back around for another round of punishment. This EP shows that Meshuggah can do a lengthy song and do it well with a bare-bones instrumental approach and a whole lot of thunderous fury. I'm honestly surprised how little this drags, if at all, thanks to the sudden rhythmic changes. Way to go, Meshuggah.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah was already advancing their sound at a swift rate with previous albums. The mechanical grooves of Chaosphere represented development from the already futuristic and cataclysmic sounds of Destroy Erase Improve which scaled up the punch of None which was based off of the thrash of Contradictions Collapse. How does this all tie in to Nothing, which seems like a massive departure towards a much slower sound where the full-on djent method of guitar-work takes primacy over the punchier and faster style employed earlier? It stretched the mechanical groove-centric nature of the last album into something slower and more hypnotic. Meshuggah took a massive leap of faith on this and what we got was something that was, well... different, but not up to the same standards as before. Nothing is where Meshuggah tried to move more for a stern, mechanical atmosphere and sacrificed a lot of catchiness for pure heaviness. It's okay, but this is much less likely to get you returning for more and there is a lot of this album that feels serviceable, but vanilla compared to what we know Meshuggah could write.\n\nOne of the biggest faults this album has is that it's using over-complicated guitar rhythms without the same sense of speed or violence that you'd get on previous albums. There are also a lot of expanses of this album that are great to listen to in the moment with their gritty, crushing, and complicated djenting, but have relatively little sticking power as they are too sluggish and the songs are often too long for these to just continue running on with only small changes. The slowness of this album is another one of its biggest weaknesses. Sure, this music is heavy and stern in its rhythms, but it also tends to get repetitive and hold up less as time passes within the songs. It also doesn't help that the worst song on Nothing is the opener. \"Stengah\" is just boring, plodding, guitar bonking that just sits on its ass for five minutes, going nowhere. It really should not have been the opener, if included at all, because all it does is sour the rest of the experience, which has a some decent elements if you can look past that one song.\n\nThere's good stuff on here as well, you just need to be a little more at ease with the groove. Some songs do have a much easier time with keeping that groove than others with \"Rational Gaze\" and \"Straws Pulled at Random\" being the most memorable, most energetic, and the hardest hitting of the bunch. Thordendal does do his best to keep this guitar flow moving with weight like an iceberg crashing into a ship. Kidman also helps the song flows with his robotic barking. Also, while not as immediately memorable, there are a lot of passages on this album that feel punishing and labyrinthine, as well as packing an elastic punch that pulls you in and gets you to enjoy what's going on, even if you won't remember most of it afterwards. Listening to Nothing is like lucid dreaming, in that you enjoy it while it's happening and just go with the flow, even though you'll only remember the most striking bits when you wake up. The density of these grooves can reel you in and the complexity of them can intrigue you, but ultimately, this lays Meshuggah's metallic skeleton bare and only offers up enough muscle to guide you through the album's rhythms while just feeling \"okay\".\n\nUltimately, the music on offer here is decent, but it doesn't go as far as we know Meshuggah can. A lot of this is hypnotic and punchy, but it's not as punchy as similar stuff they've released. While the rhythms can be serviceable and very heavy, they also lack dynamics and mobility, with the sense of speed from older albums being sorely missed on here. This album is meant to be more mind-bending than destructive, in trying for that, it succeeded. The sheer weight and complexity of the guitar and bass pulses add plenty to this. If you wanted a trip into the hypnotic side of groovy metal, you're in a good place. If you wanted a much more savage bludgeoning with riffs meant to spur on mechanized violence, you won't get nearly as much enjoyment out of this. I'm just okay with this album. It has some good ideas and many of these songs are nice groovy trips. I just think some more speed, punch, and less meandering would have made this much cooler, since it can drag at times.\n",
        "\nNone is where Meshuggah give us the first taste of the experimental and groove-heavy metal that they base their whole career and signature sound around. This isn't a derivative thrash piece like Contradictions Collapse. In fact, this establishes the sound of Destroy Erase Improve in a big change from their older thrash sound. I guess this is because Meshuggah were looking to carve a sound for themselves that they felt was more for them rather than imitating someone else. So, they make the jump from technical thrash to technical groove metal, though this is much heavier and more compositionally advanced than any popular groove bands. None is a heavy experiment in getting the most muscle out of strange rhythms and creating a mighty pummeling atmosphere of mechanical chaos with Meshuggah gaining an identity of their own and settling into their true musical modus operandi.\n\nHeavy on the polyrhythms, centered on grooves, and with a churning pulse that feels like heavy machinery punching through metal, this is how None sounds. This is the case for almost all of the songs involved and it shows just how well these guys can carry a rhythm. This is all about bounce and punch with this being the first EP to flirt with basing its most of its sound around the technique of djenting. It even stands apart from Destroy Erase Improve in this regard since this EP is even djentier than that album. That alone makes this EP unique, especially because Meshuggah would end up inspiring so many imitators with this, but this EP still stands above a lot of what came when djenting became a trend. They tie the proto-djenting together in with heavy rhythms that pound and roar with the intensity of a car crusher. The song that stands out the most is \"Ritual\" since it's the most melodic of the bunch with psychedelic-effects-laden clean guitars and Jens Kidman actually singing, yeah, he's singing on this song instead of his normal shouts, and it fits because this song is meant to be trippier. It sounds weird, but it actually makes for a nice song. The other standout track is \"Gods of Rapture\" simply because this song has a catchier riff and verses with gang shout punctuating the already vicious rhythm. Thordendal's guitar riffs feel like a spring-loaded repeat pummeling that makes you want to fling yourself around to them and Haake's precision drum pounding only gives it more impact. Music-wise, None stands well on its own, and hits with savage force and plenty of damn sweet catchy grooves too.\n\nMeshuggah establish their own identity with this EP. They also pioneer a style that few have been able to approach in a great way (djent) and run with it like naturals. What they make here is something that is pretty unique that also has some songs that you can come back to for a nice session of strength training, mosh dancing, or an episode of smashing appliances with a sledgehammer. This may not be at the power level of Destroy Erase Improve, but damn if it isn't close. It's like a little taste of the explosive hellfire to come. You have a damn good EP with plenty to offer and a solid helping of heavily technical rhythmic punishment.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah's first album is an anomaly when considering the rest of their discography. This is not the mechanical, monstrous, crushing and groove-laden sounds of a robot hell that they would become famous for with every release after this. Contradictions Collapse is an old-school thrash metal album with some progressive touches to the composition. Sure, some of Meshuggah's future penchant for songwriting with long lengths and sudden changes is here, but otherwise this is a massive departure from their future works. Comparisons to bands like Metallica and Slayer are common with this release due to the timbre of everything from the guitar tone, to the vocals, but this goes for a sound that is slightly chunkier than those bands. This is technical alright, but not at Coroner levels of wildness and is actually very rhythm-and-riff-centric. That is the basic stylistic description of Contradictions Collapse, but like with any stylistic black sheep album in a band's discography, the real question is \"is it any good?\".\n\nTo answer that question, yes it is, but it's nothing that will blow the mind of anyone who has listened to more blistering technical thrash or Meshuggah's own later material. This is also a very front-heavy album. While, it's easy to enjoy the songs that come after the first two tracks, it's not so easy to commit them to memory. \"Paralyzing Ignorance\" is a catchy piece with charging riffs and an explosive gang-shouted chorus and the pulsating riffage of \"Erroneous Manipulation\" is also infectious with the harmonized guitar melody in the last 45 seconds of the song being one of the most triumphant moments on this album. Those two tracks are what I come back to any time I re-visit Contradictions Collapse. All the other songs are good, but tend to blend together a lot (Despite being composed in a strange way) with the only exception being \"Choirs of Devastation\" which is a tad more experimental and features one of the very first examples of \"djenting\" which is interesting, but not much else can glue you to it. The sound on here is also odd, but in a familiar way. Jens Kidman is shouting, but doing so cleanly in a way that sounds much more typical of thrash instead of the head-splitting screams of later albums. When he gets his bandmates to do a gang shout with him, it rocks the floor. The production resembles that of Megadeth's albums from that time, albeit with a bit more bass which adds another layer to this and gives it a nice thud, adding some weight to this thrash attack. The most impressive feature on here is probably Fredrik Thordendal's solos which are out of control and offer up a wild prelude of the insanity that was to come on future albums. He also delivers some riffs that do a lot to keep you interested, but he hasn't developed into the guitar demon we'd know him as later on. This is an album that's pretty derivative of American thrash metal with only some progressive undertones to set it apart and shows that young Meshuggah had more skill than ideas, even if they could thrash like it was nobody's business.\n\nContradictions Collapse is decent, but ultimately there are much better things in the world of tech-thrash and in Meshuggah's own discography. If you happen to be in the mood for something that resembles a bizarre hybrid of various American thrash bands with more complex song structures and groovier riffing, then this will fit the bill. The breaks and jolts that this gives to you as well as the pulse of the rhythms in here that gives this album a lot of its strength. It's good to sit through and the metal contained inside is pounding. It's just you'll probably only remember the first two songs and everything else will fly past you like a refreshing warm breeze (albeit one from a bigass mushroom cloud like on the front). This is not as wild or as chunky as Meshuggah could get, but this is still competent and agile thrash. What you hear will still be a treat and a surprise despite the lack of focus. Fans of later Meshuggah will find something like this more curious than anything. Good for a listen, but it's nothing too distinct.\n",
        "\nThe evolution of Meshuggah takes a turn for a much chunkier and punchier sound with the longer songs being cast aside and having the grooves distilled into something much more direct and simple. The focus is clearly on the grooves for Chaosphere. Most of the songs on here have a main riff or groove that continues pummeling the listener and forms the base for all variance in the track. In essence, it's like a root with all of the minor musical ideas in each song branching off from it, but ultimately this is what holds things together. The low amount of deviance makes this album seem even more machine-like. The mechanical tendencies of Destroy Erase Improve are also upgraded so that everything sounds robotic and pulses like the hum of churning machinery, even more so than before. Chaosphere is ultimately more simple, but also much bouncier and more direct.\n\nWhile simpler, Chaosphere is still a great album with a load of heavy grooves and captivating rhythms. However, you wouldn't know this from the first track \"Concatenation\" which is just a mess. Thankfully, everything else is much more coherent and ready to get down and groove with this heavy guitar tone. I have to mention \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\" which delivers the catchiest robotic rumble on here. The insane and janky riffing on here is infectious and doesn't let you get away with the rhythm becoming enveloping. The groove-centricity of Chaosphere doesn't subtract from the aggression at all, instead making it into something that barrels down on you with all of its weight and strikes with every pulse. This is certainly less technically impressive than Destroy Erase Improve and some of the bigger songs and complex, but catchy song structures are missed greatly. Instead, the rhythms are layered on top of one another and compressed into compact, but savage and engaging grooves. The solos are pure mind-boggling insanity and Thomas Haake's drumming makes for some beats that stick well despite their off-kilter nature. Even with the super complex songs being distilled down to a simpler and more direct form, very little force is lost from earlier efforts, and this still manages to crush and rend as any good Meshuggah album should.\n\nWhile not as apocalyptic as Destroy Erase Improve or as bone-shattering as ObZen, Chaosphere is still a piece of Meshuggah that isn't worth ignoring. If you want to see how much a band could mechanize and complicate the art of making grooves, while still being muscular and aggressive, then this is for you. This is an exercise in turning the groove into a jagged-edged weapon that snares its victims and flings them bouncing about in chaos. Yes, some of the songs are so groove-centric that they fly by to some, but while they're there you get pounded like crazy and perhaps want a re-listen to get everything in more clearly. There's also the element of catchiness displayed on here that makes most of this album more attractive and replayable. This is satisfactory for a Meshuggah album, and something that I enjoy hearing smash into my eardrums.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah was, and still is an oddity in the world of extreme metal. What they did during the mid-90's was combine many of the new metallic styles of the time into something punchy and groove-laden, but also wild, intricate, and filled with the sounds of a robot-dominated future of piston drums and the rending of steel put into guitar-play. Pounding rhythms and complicated solos that fry nerves are the norm across this slab of furious and oddly hyper-intelligent metal. Destroy Erase Improve is an album that turned the trend of groovy metal on its head and brought it to peak form and technicality. This is metal that's full of blasts of chunky aggression, great builds and releases, as well as a jagged sound that reminds me of industrial robots pounding together heavy equipment in rhythm with all the aggression and precision of a Terminator.\n\nThe pounding assault of Destroy Erase Improve begins with one of the most cataclysmic songs Meshuggah have ever made, \"Future Breed Machine\". That first track sets the bar for the kind of pulse-pounding material on store in this album. Tension building and sudden shifts in tempo and tone are used in a way that keeps everything feeling energized and explosive. The snaking and complicated solos do a lot to impress and further accentuate the massive, destructive sound on display here. When you can understand Jens Kidman's enraged shouting, what he speaks is an intelligent mixture of cryptic metaphors, existentialism, and an interesting, albeit bizarre take on consciousness. It probably also helps that the main riffs to these songs are strong and do a lot to draw you into the pulse of Meshuggah's mechanized assault. Groovy tracks like \"Beneath\", \"Inside What's Within Behind\", and \"Suffer in Truth\" make the most of mixing their grooves with the impact of Kidman's roaring to accent points in the song where the energy is its highest. The way this is done is astonishing as every part of the music on this album does its part to maintain the pulse-pounding energy, while also being extremely catchy. The rhythms to these songs will be in my head for quite a while, and I'm quite happy to have them there.\n\nThe sound featured on Destroy Erase Improve is one of a kind with its air of tension and intensity translated into pulsating, robotic, off-kilter grooves. It blends sleek futurism with brutish negativity and savage riffs and screams. Momentum is maintained solidly across all songs, and some of the most memorable displays of technicality cone out on here. I remember being drawn in by the snaking, peaceful clean solos and then being blasted with pure existential frustration and blasting groove riffs on \"Sublevels\". I also remember shouting along with Jens Kidman during many of these songs and getting ready for his higher screams to make whatever song was playing pierce through. I appreciated the way that they made technicality catchy and impressive, rather than an over-long burden. This is fun music to stomp around like a brute to, and the fact that the riffs on here change fast, but also maintain coherency and momentum well does a lot to keep that stomp-fest going without a hitch. Meshuggah establish themselves as rhythmic juggernauts on this album with a consistent, crushing pulse, and an arsenal of songs that run the gamut from cataclysmic, to chunky, to even progressive songs with surprising lapses of peace, like the eye of a category 5 hurricane passing by. Destroy Erase Improve is not only consistent, but also diverse; couple that with engaging grooves and catchy shouts, and you've got a nuclear bombshell of an album.\n\nFrom the iconic first track, to the impressive last track, there is something to enjoy about the mechanized groove assault and devilishly precise and complex composition. I enjoyed all of this in all of its manic mechanical fury. Destroy Erase Improve grabbed me from minute one like a giant crane claw and didn't let go until the very end, jerk in and pounding me whichever way the groove would take me. The balance of catchiness and technicality won me over as impressive, while still being able to churn out a series of crushing songs with a futuristic edge. In 1995, everybody was marveling over the future that computers could give us. As a response, Meshuggah gave us something weighty and intelligent, but also coherent and punchy that examines humanity's space in a cataclysmic mechanized future. This slab of overpowered machine fury is something that has pounded its way into my soul with its pummeling riffs and savage momentum. This is one of my favorites because of all that it does and just how much power you can get out of this mechanized pummeling.\n",
        "\nI cannot stand this album at all. There's only so much repetition and monotony that I can take before I start to lose my mind. I understand that Meshuggah try to go for atmosphere on Catch Thirtythree with the music slowly grinding into the listener's mind and inducing existential terror, but this just gives me two feelings, neither of them pleasant or cathartic in any way. I felt so bored that I felt I should nod off instead, but I had a headache from the pure, piercing, and unengaging \"djun-dja-djun\" that was cracking against my skull like a pneumatic hammer set to run on slow mode. I wanted to sleep because this was monotonous, and I had a headache because this was monotonous, and I wanted to go to sleep to cure my headache but I couldn't sleep because my headache had gotten just THAT bad because Catch Thirtythree is boring and single-minded, yet somehow very grating, piercing, and painful at the same time.\n\nThe sensation I feel when listening to this is like being repeatedly bludgeoned in the head with a wrench. While I can understand Meshuggah's desire to experiment or go with a more atmospheric approach, but to base most of an album around only one riff that changes ever so slightly from song to song with as little deviation as possible is just insane. It's also annoying and boring. Most songs have no atmospheric quality to them at all and the ones that do are just like hearing rejected bits of \"Acrid Placidity\" for several minutes, minus the intrigue or enjoyment, either that, or it's just buzzing guitar noise in the background. This gets especially irritating considering this album is 47 minutes long, which is an insane amount of time to drag similar chugs out for. I know they tried a similar repetitive approach on Nothing, but even there, there was more variation, there was the occasional batch of cool grooves, and the repetition was song-by-song. Here, the whole album is that monotonous and even when a new riff shows up, it's in the same dull tone and often just plods around. Everything blends together in a disgusting and colorless display of headache-inducing agony.\n\nI don't give a dead man's last fuck about complex composition if the music involved is completely uninteresting and devoid of any atmosphere or feeling aside from pain and frustration being inflicted on the listener. This is about as robotic as Meshuggah can get and it makes me really mad since I know they can make music that is FAR superior to this, both in their past and in their future and they're one of my favorite bands as a result of those other albums and songs, but not the grating slog that makes up most of Catch Thirtythree. I know that many people consider this thing legendary, but I just don't see any of that here. Sorry guys, but all this did was piss me off and give me a headache. I did not like this one bit. I am aware that you have to listen extremely closely to find the complexity of the compositions here, but the main rhythm and plodding tempo numb your senses so much, it no longer feels worth it to listen for that. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find some painkillers.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s an Olympic year, meaning these five Swedish djentlemen are back with their 8th studio album The Violent Sleep of Reason. If you have heard any Meshuggah album since 1995\u2019s Destroy Erase Improve, and especially since 2002\u2019s Nothing, then you know exactly what you\u2019re about to embark on. Djent riffs at odd time signatures, robotic drumming keeping it all together, Kidman\u2019s trademark barking on top of it \u2013 yeah, it\u2019s all here, and it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work for these blokes. And yet, despite the age of the band members now and the re-crafting of their signature sound time and again, The Violent Sleep of Reason sees them gain a new lease on life, and the ten songs on here are possibly their strongest content for a while.\n\nTo preface this: Catch 33 is, and always will be, Meshuggah\u2019s best album. It\u2019s a special outlier and I can\u2019t imagine anything touching it. However, since then, I felt like they\u2019ve been treading water \u2013 doing enough to stay above the surface, but not really expending enough energy to swim to shore. ObZen was a decent album with the obvious highlight of \u201cBleed\u201d being a crowd favourite, but also propped up by other songs like \u201cLethargica\u201d and \u201cPravus.\u201d Koloss, on the other hand, was more of a worry, and I thought this band was starting to dwindle. It has its good songs, too, but there are some like \u201cDo Not Look Down\u201d and \u201cBreak Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave it Motion\u201d that I thought were too meandering. I don\u2019t mind their slower songs, but these ones were starting to sound stale. It\u2019s still an okay album but it was bogged down by some lacklustre writing. In light of this, I was less hyped than I usually am about a Meshuggah album once 2016 rolled around. However, all my fears have been allayed! This one completely surpasses the last two and is the closest competitor to Catch 33 since its release.\n\nYou just know you\u2019re in for a good album when \u201cClockworks\u201d kicks things off. This is my favourite song on the album and their best song since \u201cBleed.\u201d Haake\u2019s drumming is incredible here, and throws in ghost notes among the mechanical snare hitting which really livens up the song. I particularly enjoy the second half of this one, where the djent riffs take a more repetitive, simple note pattern. It\u2019s easy to get lost in the rhythm and tap your foot to the energy. It\u2019s about as good as an opener gets, really, and one I come back to and listen on its own away from its habitat.\n\nThe other nine songs here are completely worth your time, and while none reach the lofty heights carved out by \u201cClockworks,\u201d you\u2019re going to hear Meshuggah at their best once again. \u201cBorn in Dissonance\u201d is the first single, and actually the simplest song here. It probably works as the second track to get the listener\u2019s head back in the game. Other highlights include: \u201cBy the Ton,\u201d a slower song that retains the energy infused from earlier, containing great riffs and a really nice ending; \u201cViolent Sleep of Reason\u201d for its chaos and the uncertainty of how everything fits together; \u201cOur Rage Won\u2019t Die\u201d for being a more level-headed penultimate track, while still containing a really catchy opening djent riff that continues on in the song; and \u201cInto Decay\u201d for being a fantastic closer \u2013 the slowest song but also one of the more powerful ones.\n\nIronically, it\u2019s the strength of the weakest tracks here that make The Violent Sleep of Reason as good as it is. \u201cMonstroCity\u201d and \u201cStifled\u201d are my least favourite ones on the album, but even they have something to offer. The former sounds really sludgy, like you\u2019re suffocating in their thematic city, and the latter is still a headbanging tune with a fantastic clean synth ending that I just love. And it\u2019s these songs that portray the strength of this album, and where the last album fell short: the weaker tracks are still memorable in their own way, instead of clocking it up as \u201ca Meshuggah song.\u201d In the grand scheme of the album, they offer something even though it may not be as much. This, in turn, highlights just how good the good tracks are, such as \u201cBy the Ton\u201d and \u201cInto Decay,\u201d but especially \u201cClockworks.\u201d It underlines the potency of The Violent Sleep of Reason and gives rise to why this album is such a beast.\n\nThe djent riffs from Hagstrom and Thordendal are as intense as ever, utilising their 8-string guitars to their fullest (lowest?) effect. Thordendal\u2019s solos have not changed but here there is some more feeling in them, whether he\u2019s going all over the fretboard like in \u201cMonstroCity\u201d or keeping it simpler like in \u201cIvory Tower.\u201d Each decision enhances the song, and they\u2019re played with more conviction here than in the past. Haake\u2019s drumming is still phenomenal, despite the greying hairs that make him look like Colonel Sanders if he was in a metal band. His drumming choices have a lot more power to them and I especially like his intensity in \u201cClockworks,\u201d with the almost-a-blast-beat and double kicking action. His intensity shines through on songs like \u201cViolent Sleep of Reason\u201d and \u201cNostrum,\u201d both of which show him at his energetic best, and in the case of \u201cNostrum,\u201d almost loose and unencumbered by traditional beats.\n\nIf there was a weak point to the album, it would be Kidman\u2019s vocals. Not that he has changed a great deal in decades, but here the slow passing of time has reduced his range. Credit where it\u2019s due, though, because the dude is literally 50 years old now, and he can still bark ferociously, but I have noticed that it\u2019s a lot more monotone than it would\u2019ve been in the past. His vocals are already divisive and it will probably be make-or-break on this album, which I can understand. For myself, I can get past it and after multiple listens, the lack of range no longer bothers me as much as it did on my first listen. I hope that it\u2019s the same situation for other fans.\n\nI think this album shows Meshuggah clawing their way back to the top of the djent pile. It\u2019s got more character than ObZen, and more life than Koloss. The production is similar to Koloss but it still feels more organic, which is another point in its favour. I\u2019ve harped on it already, but every song here shows incredible power and momentum that doesn\u2019t let up. Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that they blew their load early with \u201cClockworks\u201d \u2013 while it\u2019s the best one here, the whole album must be experienced. So while it doesn\u2019t beat Catch 33 and Chaosphere, it\u2019s a proud third-place and one that I will keep coming back to for years.\n",
        "\nFinally the damn wait is over! Now with the Swedes latest album, a lot of people were wondering whether this album would be a new direction for the band or a progression from Koloss and all the jazz so let me just reiterate - this is fucking Meshuggah you're talking about folks. They've had a unique and pioneering sound from day one spanning countless imitators over the years, not to mention giving birth to pretty much a brand new sub genre of metal (read - djent). They don't need to pander to any expectations whatsoever as the band since its inception has been all about defying expectations, not meeting them in any way, shape or form. All the fans of the band will know what I'm talking about. So if you're only looking for a band that comfortably meets your expectations without surprising you in any major way every time a new release of theirs pops up, you'll probably be better off with a band like Cannibal Corpse or Vader and the like. Also please don't confuse meeting expectations with consistency. The previous bands have been consistent over the years while meeting the expectations of fans at the same time. Meshuggah however have been consistent while defying expectations simply because they are the pioneers of their own sound, showing the endless legions of generic djent bands mindlessly copying their sound that they should probably just pack up and go home. Yep, you have been schooled by the masters yet again. \n\nThe hellish palm-muted chugging of the opener \"Clockworks\" as well as the first single off the album \"Born In Dissonance\" (the first single of the album plus the most straightforward) should be enough to convince you that this album does hearken back to their speedier days of Chaosphere and the like, not to mention being their first live recording of an album since the None EP all the way back in 1994. Speaking of which, the intro of the last track \"Into Decay\" opens with a technical thrash intro going all the way back to their Contradictions Collapse days only to morph into a slower beast with quite the foot-stomping breakdown. Seriously, in pretty much every Meshuggah album there was always an element of darkness or an apocalyptic theme (obZen) but this album in all its raw unrefined glory, truly sounds like the band as a whole were having a fuckton of fun while recording it. Check out the headbangers delight \"Stifled\" for further proof, not to mention the mosh-inducing riff at 0:41 plus the epic outro that almost plays out like an OST to s sci-fi film. Believe me, I'm dead serious about the last part. \"Our Rage Wont Die\" could almost be a lost track from obZen with some of the meatiest riffs that are almost reminiscent of the pounding title track of the aforementioned album. There's a crazy level of unabashed fun and pure energy pouring out of every nook and cranny in each and every one of these songs that is hard to find or beat in the vast majority of metal releases today. Listen to any song off the album and you'll see what I'm talking about: it's not about pushing or breaking boundaries at the end of the day so much as just royally kicking some mean ass at simply nailing the one unique thing that you're so goddamn good at. And that is exactly what Meshuggah (at this point in their careers, at the very least) are all about. And let's just face it, it's not 1998 or 2002 folks: you can't pull another album like Chaosphere or Nothing and break/push the boundaries of metal music anymore. Times have changed. \n\nThe blissful groove monster \"MonstroCity\" with its spine-chilling solo (definitely one of Thordendal's best, hands down) and unbelievably brutal breakdown is truly a sight to behold. The end tremolo part almost reminds me of Catch 33. Strange indeed. Definitely my favourite song off the album along with the maniacal title track (think Chaosphere on steroids loaded with tons of groove). \"By The Ton\" and \"Ivory Tower\" (with some of the best riffs on the album) are the slower numbers, taking the hypnotic crawling pace of Nothing/Catch 33 and kick it up a few notches as far as technicality and intensity is concerned along with \"Nostrum\" which actually merges the pummeling assault of Chaosphere with the groovy technicality of Nothing to amazing effect. \n\nFor those of you yet to start listening to this groundbreaking band (why you have been depriving yourselves for so long I'll probably never know, not that I even want to) - I'd suggest you start with Koloss or obZen first in terms of sheer accessibility and then work your way up or down from there but for all the fans out there, well what the damn heck are you waiting for?? Get your hands on the album right now!! Like the title says, album of the year hands down.\n",
        "\nAnd this is how the album starts. \"Stengah,\" which has one of the heaviest intro riffs in the history of music, will kick you straight in the crotch as you press the play button and enter the world of djent riffs and plain heaviness. The 17 seconds before the drums kick in show the final transformation of Meshuggah- from their early Metallica worshiping days, to the Pantera on coke approach to thrash, and finally to this. And what is this? \n\nOne thing is sure about this album, and it's that its genre is unclassifiable. Wikipedia lists it as \"avantgrade/progressive/extreme metal,\" while the common terms for the sound of this album are \"djent,\" and even \"nu metal\" (which is a great genre by its own, but isn't even comparable to this and doesn't sound like it AT ALL). Neither fit for Nothing- only because this album is a one hit sensation which left as soon as it hit the planet. Songs like \"Spasm,\" \"Nebulous,\" and \"Organic Shadows\" show that this album is one of the landmarks of heavy music in general. I don't think that any album that was released since the beginning of the century was as revolutionary and powerful as Nothing.\n\nThe riffs here are pretty fucking outstanding. \"Rational Gaze,\" \"Perpetual Black Second,\" and \"Straws Pulled at Random\" feature some of the heaviest riffs ever created (and to make it clear-this album in its entirety is one of the heaviest and most brutal things ever recorded) show this the best- if Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere were known for their very odd time signatures and approach to groove and time signatures, only these songs prove that this album featured a new peak for the band. The approach to riffing was changed drastically- from mostly playing staccato power chords, the guitar players now play a very uncommon style of riffing which immediately brings the technique of bass guitar to mind, Songs like \"Closed Eye Visuals\" and \"Glints Collide\" show that type of riffing at its most clear, with sounding like the only guitars used in this album were bass guitars (which is quite funny considering it's overshadowed by the guitars in the album because of their super heavy and crushing tone). The solos were made more crawling and alien sounding, and are akin to a twisted form of jazz fusion more than to anything else, which immediately brings Destroy Erase Improve to mind. \n\nConsidering how twisted this album is musically and riff wise, the initial thought is that it couldn't get any better than that. WELL IT JUST FUCKING DID. Jens Kidman, which his face is the infinite meme-spawner, provides one of his best vocal performances of all time and sounds very mechanical and robotic but alive at the same point- in contrast with the newer Meshuggah albums in which he over-pronounces every word and sounds like Randy Blythe (but in a bad way). His staccato vocal delivery is very commanding and aggressive, which fits the music perfectly along with the ultra-tight drums which play riffs in standard time which makes the music sound ever more disjointed and mechanic, which is exactly what the band aimed for with this album. While the same approach was kept throughout most of the album's duration, no part here sounds boring, overused, too droney, or out of place. \n\nAtmosphere-wise, this album features the classic Meshuggah feeling. Post apocalyptic, mechanical, and even industrial at some times are the words that come in mind very often. There are some points of refrain, such as the melodic outro of \"Straws Pulled in Random\" which is clearly one of the most memorable parts of the album, and the final track, which is the instrumental \"Obsidian\" that concludes the album in a calm (everything is relative) way. From the doomy section of \"Nebulous,\" to the semi-calm and post apocalyptic \"Obsidian,\" to the chaotic \"Rational Gaze\" and \"Organic Shadows,\" this album is plain fucking killer and features one of the most dynamic atmospheres the band has ever created in their music.\n\nMeshuggah lyrics are Meshuggah lyrics, as always. They are eccentric, unorthodox, and vary in subject from very esoteric themes to some very erratic things, which sound like they were written during a very weird acid trip. Here's an example:\n\n\"Random beats of blinding shockwaves. Erratic suns\nthat twist my eyes\nFlashes pounding at my thoughts as the intrinsic pains\nmultiply\" (\"Spasm\")\n\nAnyway, this album is pretty fucking killer. No words needed. The production here is prefect as well, with being very bass heavy which accentuates the music and the atmosphere. NEVER GET THE RE-RECORDING THOUGH. It destroyed the album's musicianship and made it sound very forced and fake as well. Mandatory for any fan of heavy music.\n",
        "\nNothing is pretty much one of my favorite albums ever. The heavy polyrhythmic chugging, the mechanical vocals and the intense drumming in the original version clearly made it a significant metal landmark (and kickstarted the whole djent subgenre).\n\nThe reason this version of Nothing is useless is because the original release of the album had the musicianship noted above and a very unique, distinctive, and last but not least, IT WAS GOOD. The band sounded alive but robotic in the same time, with the repetitive drums and chugs putting you in some kind of a transcendental state (especially with the songs \"Organic Shadows\" and \"Rational Gaze\" which are some of the definitive highlights of the album). But in this re-release, the music on this album was removed of its human origins and was made very robotic and fake sounding. The drum machines sound clearly out of place here, and the rerecorded guitars with the new equipment sound too processed and out of place for this album (although it worked very well with the next album, Catch 33)\n\nAnother reason of why this version is inferior to the original is that except for the shitty production this release was given, a few songs were altered in their speed which was useless, because the originals sounded much better. For example, Nebulous and Rational Gaze were lowered in their pace and speed which made them lose most of their original magic. These meaningless alterations are accompanied with over-reverberated vocals which sound detached and unrelated to the music, making this entire version of the album sound bland and soulless.\n\nGive yourself a favor, and if you ever get the chance to listen to the original release do it right now. The re-release butchered the music, and made one of the heaviest and best albums of the century sound like it was recorded by the band's own cover band, and has no soul compared to the original. Avoid like fire.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah are back in business, and, as per usual, business is quite literally booming (in odd time signatures). Four years removed from the mighty Koloss, and the quintet have returned with album number eight in The Violent Sleep of Reason, a title inspired by \u2018The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters,\u2019 an etching found in Francisco Goya\u2019s late eighteenth century suite Los Caprichos. On the outset, Goya\u2019s work shows an artist having a nightmare, one filled with pestering, swooping creatures like bats and owls. But, as one would surmise, the context is deeper than the paper it\u2019s printed on, with Goya using the scene to symbolize the folly and irrationality of his Spanish society. Meshuggah, of course, are not Spanish. They\u2019re Swedish, and they are \u2018crazy,\u2019 which, if you\u2019re following this whole Goya thing, should rightly elicit no small amount of troubled dreams.\n\nOne of a cluster of huge metal bands enjoyed by both metal \u2018plebes\u2019 and \u2018purists\u2019 alike, Meshuggah continue to rebuke the inevitable tide of gray hair and achy joints by playing their self-invented \u2018djent\u2019 sound better than their younger copycats and counterparts by way of sheer wisdom, finesse, and an approach that demands tourniquet tight teamwork. On The Violent Sleep of Reason, it is business as usual. What one expects from Meshuggah\u2014bulbous grooves, gigantic off-kilter rhythms, and soul-scraping roars\u2014one most certainly is granted, with the result, as far as these ears hear, falling somewhere between Nothing and Koloss, but, as it just so happens, eclipsing neither by way of impact or durability.\n\nDoes that make The Violent Sleep of Reason a lesser Meshuggah record? Well, no\u2026and a most definitive, sort of. For the first time in nearly 25 years, the band recorded the album live, a distinction that does lend the album a more \u2018natural\u2019 feel, but which likewise doesn\u2019t necessarily weaken their well-oiled, and unmistakable, dystopian air of big metallic things colliding with other big metallic things. The opener \u201cClockworks\u201d proves the most exacting, longest, and most impressive bitch of the bunch, with the song\u2019s final three minutes a hardened endurance test redolent of Obzen\u2019s \u201cPravus.\u201d The follow-up, the record\u2019s first single, \u201cBorn in Dissonance,\u201d plays like quintessential Meshuggah, swollen and labyrinthine with engine-driven bass-work and Fredrik Thordendal\u2019s eerie guitar lines wailing over pummeling war drums.\n\nWith the exception of the curiously ineffective \u201cMonstrocity,\u201d the album is notably front-loaded. The band\u2019s penchant for contagious groove undergirds tracks like \u201cStifled\u201d or the closer \u201cInto Decay,\u201d but, performances aside, it\u2019s hard to deny that many of the record\u2019s most memorable moments occur early and often. Still, the kinetic and rubber-walled bounciness of \u201cOur Rage Won\u2019t Die\u201d remains hopelessly fun, and does much to jumpstart any waning adrenaline.\n\nUltimately, The Violent Sleep of Reason exists as another stentorian slab of climatic progressive metal, coaxing even the weakest of imaginations to envision ranges of exploding peaks, terrible, billowing skies, and any other doomsday scenario worth its salt in destruction. Meshuggah may not have eclipsed the consistent mighty crunch of their last record, but there\u2019s still no denying the white-knuckled satisfaction one feels when old man Kidman strolls to the storefront and flips the sign to \u2018OPEN.\u2019\n\nWritten for The Metal Observer\n",
        "\nAs a fan of Meshuggah, I'm willing to admit that there's not a lot of variation in their recipe. But, if you've got a unique sound, it's not a bad thing to stick with it, honing your skill. And, if you're responsible for the birth of an entire (sub)genre, I can understand the need to be the best at it.\n\nWith 'Pitch Black', the band is still pretty much doing their thing, but not as aggressively as they normally do it. The screaming has been replaced with an eerie mumbling of words, slathered on top of monotonous riffs and atonal string-plucking reverberating in the background. The climax comes somewhere in the middle with a short, batshit crazy solo that sounds like an old modem gone haywire.\n\nThe music has some abrupt changes in pace and mood, and ranges from pretty mellow bass doodling to some eclectic planet-crashing metal reminiscent of Blotted Science (and themselves, of course). Like with most of their work, this sounds equal parts improvised and meticulously calculated, like the jam session of a hive mind.\n\nIt's still very much Meshuggah, but a nice little straying off the path at the same time. It's always nice to see a band stretch their creative muscles and also succeeding at it.\n",
        "\nI honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. An album that's stayed with me for almost a decade while simultaneously changing the way I look at music and metal as a whole as well as wowing me every single freaking time I listen to it. This album is a planet-shattering testament of the mere fact that the supposed conventions and boundaries of metal (and music for that matter) simply do not exist for some artists out there who constantly seek to re-invent and innovate themselves time and time again. We as mere listeners are clearly not worthy. Don't even remotely think that this album has catchy riffs and hooky songwriting - If you're one of those, you may happily return to your Iron Maiden and thrash metal. More than likely you'll be severely disappointed with this. \n\nYou make ask now why the fuck can't I stop gushing about this album at every moment, well let me tell you exactly why - this album completely destroys and dismantles every single preconcieved notion you probably have about being \"progressive\" or \"technical\" and literally plays completely by its own set of rules (if they can even be called 'rules' in that sense). And no I ain't merely talking about the minute long tracks slowly building up to an epic suite of music; sure Edge Of Sanity, Green Carnation, Rush and the like have pulled off that kind of approach to songwriting with stomping success in the past, but there is a completely new ball game at work here. Sure the approach might be similar, but that's about it. The sheer dread, awesomely terrifying and uneasy vibe that slowly but steadily creeps up on you track by track, building it up more and more up till the masterful tremolo part at the end of \"Entrapment\" leading to the end echoing part of \"Mind Mirrors\" only to finally explode into an even heavier onslaught of mind-numbing groove with \"In Death-Is Life\" is the ultimate lesson on how to completely and totally nail scintillating dynamics and the concept of ebb and flow in music as a whole. And here's the thing - it fucking fits like a glove, not even remotely sounding out of place, stitched-up or pretentious in the slightest! Which unfortunately, very few artists in the realm of metal really know how to do. Big words? Maybe. Totally the kind of thing that makes you sit up in stunned shock and realize \"Holy fuck, these guys are on a whole new level as far as bringing artistic ingenuity and alien technicality into a genre like metal\". Truly unparalleled stuff. And Jens Kidman, my fucking word. He was always an amazing vocalist, but he sounds truly possessed by the demons of hell here. \n\nUnlike the albums by the aforementioned bands which were mainly about the development and build-up (aka progression) of different epic slices of music with weaving melodies, you'll barely find wisps and faint traces of very subtle melody to latch on to as this album is pretty much all about mind-numbing rhythmic intensity and jarring displacement multiplied by a thousand plus a complete reformatting of the supposedly standard rules of technical death/progressive metal songwriting, even introducing soothing ambient parts and eerie bits of silence (yes!) which only adds to the feeling of dread and morbid chasm of atmosphere this album conjures. Listen to \"In Death Is Death\" (man that eerie part at 0:45 is just beyond otherworldly in every sense of the word plus that echoing riff progression at 2:45, not to mention the stunningly technical break at 4:37) and \"Shed\" (essentially the single of the album, if you will) to get a clearer idea of what I mean exactly. Or better yet, the whole damn album! The closest that you'll be getting to melody is probably \"Shed\" and \"Dehumanization\" with faints lines of eerie melodic lines sprinkled over the brutal grooves and hypnotic chugs. Sure their previous albums Nothing and I had a similar approach, but as far as the ambient/jazz influence and poly-rhythms are concerned, it's clearly evident that on this album, the entire band as a whole kicked it up several notches, producing a nearly unparalleled work of art. If you doubt my words, listen to this band and album and please try to tell me any other artist/s that sound even remotely similar. Go on, I'll be waiting right here. Not to mention that the lyrics are simply mind-blowing.Then again considering it's Meshuggah, no surprise there. I mean, just read the below lyrics from \"Entrapment\" and tell me if I'm wrong - \n\nInsurrection games convincingly performed\nIncapacitated by physical thoughts \nActing out the will of tendon and bone\nHave the bridges of insanity been crossed and forever retracted?\nAm I standing among a thousand selves? \nIs the multitude of laughters mine alone?\n\n\nAnd here's another thing about this album that sets it apart from most of its peers - the ultimate sum of its parts and its crushing horrifying atmosphere that suffocates the living fucking daylights out of you for every single minute of its 48 minute duration and doesn't let up for even a second, with the obvious exception of \"Mind Mirrors\" and maybe the latter half of \"Sum\". Each section flows perfectly into the other like the best of classical music back in the day (not to compare this to classical music, but just so you get the picture) and the re-occurrence of certain rhythmic patterns and similar sounding melodies are bizarrely hypnotic (as other reviewers have already pointed out) making for a perfect musical interpretation of an otherworldly acid trip (the latter half of \"In Death-Is Death\" and \"Sum\" (one of the most bizarre yet fitting conclusions to such a monumental album with one of the best riff progressions on the album kicking in at 1:09) embody this fact in stone with epic echoing counterpoint melodies fading in and out), like you see an array of beautiful patterns rich with detail and craft laid out in front of you that you really can't make head or tail of, yet you are unable to tear your gaze away from them because they are so beautiful and ultimately all come together to form a dense spiraling web of intricacies that would probably make your eyes pop. Excuse the lame description, but surely you get my drift. In that sense you will probably not understand what the fuck is going on (unless you know how to decode the poly-rhythms of this band, which I highly doubt) but you will find dazzling patterns and re-occurrences in the music of this work of art that will slowly burrow its way into your mind until you slowly begin to see and most importantly, understand the brilliant overall picture of this magnificent album. This is one of the main common grounds this album shares with the band's seminal Nothing release with the only exception being that Nothing had more individualistic songs in comparison with Catch 33 which flows like one continuous 48 minute song. That is the main thing - a ton of patience is required to pierce through the mystery surrounding this album (not to mention that you most certainly won't end up liking the album during the first few listens because of its dazzling inaccessibility - I definitely know that I didn't like it initially, but then it slowly grew on me bit by bit like no other album ever had) and if you're one of those who prefers having their music hook-laden and catchy to at least a slight degree, I should probably give you a heads up that this album is clearly not for you. Try \"Destroy Erase Improve\" instead. \n\nAs you can see, I've clearly tried but man, no amount of spiraling superlatives can do this album justice, you just need to seek it out and experience it for yourself. I honestly cannot stress the last sentence enough. Of course it goes without saying that this sort of music is not for everyone - every if you happen to be both a prog and a tech death fan, a lot of people out there just don't have the attention span to sit through a piece of music this long, preferring the generic song-by-song approach. Then again, this is Meshuggah you're talking about, so like I already said - Do bear in mind that an exceptional amount of patience would be required especially for this album. In my opinion, the best approach would be to enter the realm of this album with absolutely no preconceived notions about how the album should sound or what genre category it should belong to. None of that \"This must definitely be the logical successor to Nothing/I\". Mark my words - if you go down that road, you'll be up for some crushing disappointment there my friend. Meshuggah have never really been about predictability and this album proves just that and the fact that whether you like it or not, they are truly one of the best bands to have walked the earth in metal's four-and-a-half decade history. This has been one of my all time favourite albums ever since I discovered it 8 years ago and is truly a titan yet to be dethroned from its number one spot amongst all my favourite classics and albums over the years (which if you've gone through my reviews, is a hell of a long list in any case). As another reviewer aptly put it, this is truly \"the future of metal\".\n",
        "\nHoly mother of GOD! Like seriously this album just destroys everything into dust. There\u2019s no other way to put it. And a quick reminder for all of you out there, this was way back in 1998! Unfortunately it would take another 4 more years after the release of Nothing in 2002 for Meshuggah to slowly but steadily attain the level of popularity that we attribute to them today. Sandwiched between DEI and Nothing, unsurprisingly Chaosphere has absolutely nothing in common with either of the aforementioned albums. This is Meshuggah and they play only by their own rules after all. At first the album will sound like one long inaccessible slab of pure noise, but repeated listens will prove otherwise and your ears will begin to dig through the relentless mayhem. I mean Meshuggah as a band is quite inaccessible, but even by their standards, this is one of their hardest albums to get into. All you newbies out there would do well to keep that fact in mind. \n\nThen again it doesn\u2019t really help the fact that the opener \u201cConcatenation\u201d is one of the more inaccessible songs on the album, which is one of the instances when I get the reason why both the detractors and casual fans of the band usually shun this album over more accessible works of the band like Nothing or obZen. But then again, give it enough time and patience and you will begin to see the brilliance of this album for what it is. Also this is without a doubt Meshuggah\u2019s heaviest and fastest record to boot, with the band rarely taking their foot off the gas, with the exception of probably \u201cUnanything\u201d, the slow mid-paced groovy assault of \u201cNeurotica\u201d and lastly the eerie hissing hammer attack of \u201cThe Exquisite Machinery Of Torture\u201d. Otherwise it\u2019s a constant pummelling of your senses, left right and centre till the very end. The mosh-inducing \u201cThe Mouth Licking What You\u2019ve Bled\u201d is probably the fastest song on the album and I also I have to mention one of the most underrated songs of Meshuggah - \u201cCorridor Of Chameleons\u201d. The shifting grooves and the super-fast vocals in this song are to fucking die for. I would seriously kill to hear this song live. Pity they didn\u2019t play it on their obZen tour when they came down to India. \n\nHere Thordendal completely eschews the melodic smooth jazzy feel of the lead-work in DEI (Acrid Placidity, Sublevels etc) for an out-and-out free-form crazy atonal jazz style which is really hard to make head or tail of to be honest, especially the first time you hear it. The dialling of a telephone or the computing/calculating noises made by the droids in Star Wars come to mind. Completely whacked out, chaotic, weird and unnerving as hell. But I\u2019ll be damned if it doesn\u2019t fit the music like a glove. After hearing this album umpteen times, it\u2019s quite apparent that no other solo style would fit the music better. Speaking of whacked out, wait till you hear the last song \u201cElastic\u201d and be spooked out for the rest of your life. This song is the literal soundtrack to non-humanoid aliens ravaging our planet for resources sending their machines to carve up the Earth and its resources into fine dust. Horror-inducing insanity. Check out the ultra-tight breakdown at 1:31 where you really get to hear the crunchy sound of the guitars and the hallucinogenic guitar solo soon after. The part of the song at 4:14 till 5:55 where that breakdown is repeated while the lead is slowly detuned is one hell of a mind-bending effect leading up to the the crazy reverberation effect getting louder and louder with every passing minute till 11:20 where it\u2019s a mix of all the previous songs being playing at once at double the speed. Sweet Satan what a fucking song! To quote two YouTube comments that summarize this song perfectly - \n\n\u201cI would probably kill myself with the nearest utensil if I heard this on LSD\u201d \n\n\u201cThe day I play this song is the day the whole world gets fucked up and destroyed by the strange grey goo matter\u201d. \n\nNo shit son. No shit!\n\nThe calm vibe of \u201cUnanything\u201d is a much needed saviour after the ravaging madness of the previous 8 songs. Kidman\u2019s vocals on DEI were more of an angry growl/shout but here it\u2019s a pure hardcore shout mirroring the jagged riffs and unsettling atmosphere of the music. A match made in hell. Also who can forget one of their live favourites for the last decade and the headbangers ultimate delight \u201cNew Millennium Cyanide Christ\u201d stretching your sinews to the breaking point? This song along with the foot-stompingly brutal \u201cSane\u201d (listen to that fucking breakdown!) are two of the more accessible songs on the album so I would advise you check them out first before moving on to the whole album. \n\nEven though I don\u2019t agree with this, I\u2019ve got to give one thing to the detractors of this album: it can be a bit mind-numbing and boring to sit through 8 tracks of uber technical polyrhythmic metal all cut from the same fast-paced relentless cloth and let\u2019s face it - to the untrained ear, all the songs can easily sound like one another which is the most common compliant all the detractors of this album and band. Plus one of the most common complaints people have about Meshuggah which (supposedly) holds true even for this album: Too many of the riffs sound identical/similiar due to the exceptionally low-tuning of the guitars. To this I say, bull-fucking-shit. Sure the guitars are tuned really low, but that just means you have to pay much closer attention to the guitars to make out the slight variations in the riffs and the subtle but formidable technicality in literally each note, which (in my opinion) is where a lot of metalheads fail, simply dismissing the album after a couple of spins. A heck of a lot of patience is required to break through the inaccessible mist surrounding this album and if you ever thought any of their other albums was too hard to get into, wait till you listen to this one. I\u2019ll leave it at that. But to a die-hard metal fan of all things technical, brutal and complex, this is pure auditory bliss.\n",
        "\nSweden's Meshuggah has always been a polarizing band, recognized almost universally for their technical skill, but also widely disliked due in no small part to their hand in spawning the \"djent\" movement, maybe the most hated sub-genre of metal in the last decade. It's funny that a band I love so much could inspire such a huge amount of bands I detest, but I'm not here to talk about Periphery or TesseracT (though I'd love to complain about them for an hour). Although obZen is one of my favorite albums, I can see how people might not like it. Maybe the vocals are too robotic, the songs too machine-like, the riffs too repetitive for some, but all these things work together to create a sound like no-one else has in metal, not even all the djent copycats. If you've never heard of Meshuggah before, be prepared for weird, dissonant riffs played over 4/4's so many times that they seem to go off rhythm, only to repeat until they're right back where they started. It's a formula this band perfected a few albums ago, and it earns them both praise and hatred.You'll definitely either love or hate this album, and since I fall into the former category, let me explain what it is that makes this album one of my favorites.\n\nobZen starts with a song that's reminiscent of Meshuggah's earlier work like 1998's Chaosphere, Combustion. The fastest track on the album, Combustion is a thrashy, energetic song, which honestly could be a little deceiving if you've never heard Meshuggah before, as it really isn't much like the rest of the album, having a much simpler riff, less polyrhythms, and no tempo changes. It is no less kick-ass though, and is definitely one of the highlights of the album. Starting with Electric Red, the rest of the album descends into polyrhythmic madness, conforming more to the typical Meshuggah formula we've come to know and love (or hate), but for the most part staying at a much slower pace than previous albums, especially on Electric Red and Lethargica. Probably their most well known song, Bleed is another highlight of obZen, with it's extremely punchy riffs demonstrating that Meshuggah can make effective use of simple patterns, being that the main riff is essentially triplets repeated again and again while slowly changing key. I can't properly describe how heavy this song is, so I won't bother trying. Just trust me, it's heavy. Tomas Haake's drumming is outstanding on Bleed (well, it is on the whole album, but on this song especially), playing a 4/4 for most of the song, while playing triplets on the bass pedals to match the guitar's frenzied chugging. I'm a drummer myself, and this song is no joke to try and play.\n\nSome of my favorite Meshuggah lyrics can also be found on obZen, with some of the best songs lyrically being Dancers To a Discordant System, obZen, Lethargica, and Pravus. As dark and cold as ever, the lyrics on obZen really help to enhance pretty much every song, with Kidman's mid range, monotonic bark delivering them as venomously as humanly possible. Some of the best include these from Dancers To a Discordant System:\n\nListen to the hidden tune\nThe essence of lies in notes defined\nAs we dance to the dissonant sway\nThe choreography refined\n\nAs well as these from obZen:\n\nA new belief system\nSalvation found in vomit and blood\nWhere deprivation lies\nCorruption, war, and pain is god\n\nIn a genre where lyrics are so often just there for the sake of lyrics, it's refreshing to find a band like Meshuggah who clearly actually care about them (for more great lyrics, check out Nile, Opeth and Type O Negative).\n\nThe production on obZen is slightly harsher than on the last two albums, though not quite as raw as on Chaosphere. It works pretty well for the overall aesthetic of the album, and has a fairly wide sound, allowing you to hear clearly what every instrument is doing, and making the sections with those weird, almost jazzy guitar parts in the background that much better. Everything is evenly balanced, with none of the instruments really dominating any of the songs, rather they all compliment and accent each other, with the vocals being near but not quite at the forefront of this immense assault on the senses.\n\nGuitar tone hasn't changed too much from previous albums, maybe going a bit more bass-heavy than before, but still retaining that classic Meshuggah sound that isn't really comparable to any other band. It can be hard to pick out the bass when the guitars are so bassy themselves, but when you do find it, it has a nice, fairly clean sound, but doesn't sacrifice any aggression for cleanness. Technically, the guitars are of course as impressive as always, with Meshuggah managing to play the most mind-bending polyrhythms with the greatest of ease, without ever reaching wankery levels of technicality. Whether they're playing intensely fast riffs like Combustion, or triplet based songs like Bleed or obZen, the level of skill these guys have is just insane. The restraint shown really is one of the strong points of the album, it doesn't ever sound like the band is showing off, like Dragonforce. There's no overblown solos, no shredding for 15 minutes on end, and no riffs that were thrown in just because they were impressive.\n\nOverall, obZen is one the strongest additions to Meshuggah's discography, improving on Nothing and Catch Thirty-Three while keeping most of the little oddities that make this band so unique. It's an album that doesn't seek to please anyone, doesn't try to appeal to anyone, and moves a step closer to dissonant, deviant musical perfection. If you like albums that leave you thinking \"what did I jut listen to?\" then this might just be for you. If you're someone who wrote Meshuggah off a long time ago as just another djent band, you're really missing out on one of the most groundbreaking albums of the 2000's. Love them or hate them, Meshuggah left a mark with this album, and in my opinion, this will always be one the best.\n",
        "\nThere is much to be said about this record. \"Psykisk Testbild\", also called simply \"Meshuggah\", has some clearly distinguishable progressive elements in the background of a thrash environment. This is a lot like Metallica, in more ways than one. For example, Jens Kidman drops his signature growl, and uses a harsh embodiment of what a thrash vocalist would sound like if they tried to over-exaggerate an American accent. Jens does attempt to sing a bit on this album, but maybe he was right to move over to growls later on.\n\nThe drums are another thing that would catch anyone off guard, as they are no longer the polyrhythmic hurricane that was in the later albums. A simple thrash \"gallop\" is used throughout the album, with the occasional 4/4 hi-hat pattern with a snare on the third beat. The drums are still one of the most important parts of the music.\n\nThe guitar work is obviously the thing that most people will notice about this album, as it uses power chords instead of the down-tunes chugs that Meshuggah is used to. Jazz riffs play a big part in this album, just like most of Meshuggah's albums, so that is one similarity between the newer stuff.\n\nAll in all, this is not a bad record, and if you like thrash, then you should take a listen. If you are more into the djent that Meshuggah employs, then you might want to stay away. The production of this piece is not as good as the newer stuff, obviously, but for people who love a raw metal sound, that should make it more enjoyable.\n",
        "\nFrom the thunderous opening chords of \"I Am Colossus\" to the ambient fadeout of \"The Last Vigil\" this album is an exercise in otherworldly brutality like never before. Well of course not, Meshuggah have done it time and time again, but still. It\u2019s just unbelievable how these guys can make such different sounding albums with pretty much the same ingredients over and over again in a career spanning two and a half decades, without losing any of the rhythmic intrigue and intensity, but then again this is Meshuggah you\u2019re talking about. \n\n\u201cThe Demon\u2019s Name Is Surveillance\u201d is almost a throwback to the ridiculously speedier days of Chaosphere and \u201cDo Not Look Down\u201d is so ridiculously groovy that you could almost dance to it while simultaneously doing somersaults and breaking the necks of five people around you. On second thought, keep that twisted fantasy in your head; don\u2019t even think of trying it out in real life. You heard me. \u201cThe Hurt That Finds You First\u201d keeps up the groove factor by pushing the pedal to the max in the first and middle half of the song, only to apply the brakes towards the end fading out with a slow groovy riff with the clean guitar echoing mournfully in the distance. A colossal (ha!) punch to the face of all the idiotic elitist detractors of the band who claim that they just mindlessly chug away without knowing anything about dynamics and songwriting. Listen to this song, you ignorant fucking hacks, and die. \n\n\"Marrow\" should get your neck snapping in no time, with its split time grooves compelling you to do nothing but kick multiple holes in your wall till nothing but dust remains. The solo is undoubtedly Thordendal at his best with a heavy dose of atonal alien weirdness. The maestro doing what he does best. The bone-crushing breakdown at 4:47 is guaranteed to make you kill the nearest living person just so you can grind each of his 206 bones into fine dust and pour it on the grave of his forefathers. Definitely my personal highlight of the album. Even \"Swarm\" has a mind-numbingly awesome combination of groove and technicality with its ascending and discordant guitar progressions tailor made to make lily-livered mincemeat out of you in the next Meshuggah moshpit. You'd better watch out next time. \"\"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\" has a similar snaking effect with its slamming polyrhythmic chugs interspersed with the techy guitar parts where Haake really showcases the slower groovier side to his drumming.\n\nCompared to obZen which was more of a straightforward and hellish outpouring, in Koloss the atmospheric and mind-bending (read: alien) elements of Meshuggah\u2019s music has taken center stage just like in the case of previous albums like Catch 33 and the like, with slower with slower more mid-paced riffs carrying an addictive groove slowly burrowing their way into your mind. Check out \"Demiurge\" and \"Behind The Sun\" for further proof. Even you don't believe the Catch 33 influence, listen to the final song \"The Last Vigil\" where you can almost picture yourself watching the perfect sunset of vivid and dazzling colours splashing all over the evening sky and slowly fading away, finally giving in to the darkness of the night. This theme fits the song like a glove. Then again, this is not the first time the band has showcased its ambient side (\u201cAcrid Placidity\u201d on Destroy Erase Improve, parts of Nothing and the whole of Catch 33) and I look forward to more such songs. \n\nOnce again the almighty Mesh kill it. This should come as a surprise to no one since that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been doing ever since their inception in 1991. Their discography throughout the last 25 years is the fucking epitome of consistency and perfection emerging triumphant against all odds. It has been said that they are gearing up for another album later this year. I for one can\u2019t wait to see what they have up their sleeve next. Bring on the next album maestros. Another blissful lesson in polyrhythmic ass-whopping awaits.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah was the first band I've listened to that featured growled or screamed vocals. At first, I didn't really know whether I loved it or hated it. The only thing I was absolutely sure was that I didn't like the vocals, but, over the time, not only the vocals, but the whole dynamic of the band grew on me. It grew so much that, for about 3 months, the only thing I listened to was Meshuggah, and this album was the first of their discography I've ever heard, back in 2013.\n\nKoloss is the band's seventh studio album and was released back in early 2012. When I listened to it for the first couple of times, I was fascinated by songs like Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion. The creepy, dissonant intro followed by that bassy, chugging, bone-crushing riff with Jens' classic vocals on top and that bridge where everything calms down for a while, with the guitars dissonating over the bass and drums. If there's one thing this album nails in almost every song, it's the intro. Like in the song \"Swarm\", where the intro literally sounds like a swarm is approaching you.\n\nAs always in Meshuggah's catalog, Koloss shows how brilliant the band members are. The guitars are played in such a strange tempo that it makes it hard for anyone to headbang to any of the songs of their discography. The tone the guitars bring is absolutely amazing. It's so bassy, so chuggy, but at the same time, we can hear every note played. It doesn't get muddy, and it doesn't turn into that blob of notes, where you have no idea what is being played. The riffs are pure obliteration. Meshuggah really knows how to create them in a way that you feel them reverberating in your soul. Every time that 8th string is played, it seems like you get stomped by a giant in the chest. The drums are a different show. It's no surprise Tomas Haake is one of the best and most technical drummers in our time. He plays extremely odd patterns and time signatures in sonic speed with an unhuman accuracy and he does it without getting boring on either the slow ones like Behind The Sun, or in the ones Haake breaks the speed of sound with the constant, destroying double-bass, like The Demon's Name Is Surveillance.\n\nAlthough I can't praise this album enough for its technicality and brutality, I still have some problems with it. When I first heard New Millennium Cyanide Christ, back in Chaosphere, I remember being confused and, also, amazed by that guitar solo, if it can be called that way. It's, to this day, one of the weirdest guitar solos I've ever heard. And this album lacks this kind of sensation. The solos don't do much for me. It seems they were put in the album just to be there, they don't add a thing to any song of the album. The riffs are incredible, but the guitars don't do much else. Variety was never something Meshuggah was known for. They always played that same formula and went on an endless journey to perfect that sound with each album. And I can understand that, but I don't think I want it anymore. I just wish they experimented a little more, because going through this whole thing for me, was a little tiring and, at times, excruciating.\n\nKoloss is a solid album, although it's not the best they can do. Not even close. If you want to get into this band, there are much better albums that I'd recommend you, like 'Destroy Erase Improve\", \"Chaosphere\", \"Nothing\", or, more recently, \"Catch Thirtythree\".\n\nFavorite tracks: \"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\", \"Marrow\", \"Demiurge\" and \"I Am Colossus\"\n",
        "\nMeshuggah before Meshuggah?\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to properly articulate your feelings about a favourite band of yours, not to mention one of the most influential and ground-breaking bands of all time. This was back in 1991 after all. I mean at a time when thrash had been (pretty much) fully established as a genre plus the birth of death metal a few year prior had set the stage for the genre to take on a more progressive and technical nature, Meshuggah had already levelled and reshaped the metal landscape with this tactical nuke of a debut album. It\u2019s a real shame most people tend to overlook this album in favour DEI or any of their later post-Nothing works. Trust me; if you\u2019re one of them, you\u2019re truly missing out on a technical feast for the ears. \n\nAround 1991, the concept of technical metal wasn\u2019t a relatively new one. Bands like Watchtower, Coroner, Nocturnus, Atheist, Death, Voivod, Annihilator, Obliveon, Deathrow, At The Gates (that\u2019s right!!) and Fates Warning had all released stunning albums of their own redefining and reforming technical metal as we know it today in each of their own artistic image. Other phenomenal artists like Cynic, Cryptopsy, Monstrosity, Martyr, Nile, Opeth, Spiral Architect, Spastic Ink, Psycroptic and Decapitated were yet to hit the scene, but the bottom line is that even on their debut, Meshuggah had an original sound of their own. \n\nThe major beef most people have about the album is the production. I get it, the snare drum sound is horrible plus there\u2019s way too much reverb on all the instruments blah blah. But then again, you fellas need to remember and understand that this was the turn of the 90s and their debut album to boot; considering all the factors, come on guys there\u2019s no way in hell you could possibly expect them to come up with an impeccably produced album at the time. Plus at times, the strange production actually works to the albums advantage giving the bass and drums that extra pounding edge that seems to be sorely lacking in a lot of metal releases today. \n\nAs far as riffs are concerned, there\u2019s an OVERLOAD of them here. The guitar duo of Hagstrom and Thordendal simply rip it letting loose a fearsome salvo of riffs. And even back then, Thordendal showcases his alien jazzy influences in his meandering leadwork even though they may come across as overtly atonal to the untrained ear. Listen to his solos on \u2018Abnegating Cecity\u2019 and \u2018Internal Evidence\u2019 and tell me that he didn\u2019t already establish his unique blueprint in the lead guitar department even back then. \n\nThe technicality on this album is truly stunning, the likes of which were yet to be attempted by any band in that era. In fact even now, I have yet to hear another album that sounds like Meshuggah\u2019s debut. You can say other bands have tried since then, but barely scratched the surface of what these Swedish madmen accomplished here. Like the always say, a band\u2019s debut is usually more unrefined and raw, as compared to their later works, which definitely holds true in the case of Meshuggah. \n\nThe acoustic break in \"Qualms Of Reality\" is just perfect, smoothly leading the song into its pounding and explosive finale with the mosh-inducing gang-shouts. The opening riff of \"We'll Never See The Day\" is sure to get your head banging in the first 20 seconds itself while looking for the nearest heavy object to ram someone in the nether regions. On second thought, no don't try that out. The sitar part sounds a tad out of place though. \n\nAlthough I hate to point this out, but the acoustic intro to \"Choirs Of Devastation\" sounds out of place and ill-fitting; the song could've clearly done without the intro and spoken words. Quite unnecessary, but then again this was their first album. The album ends with the more straightforward and thrashy Cadaverous Mastication (one heck of a song title, try forgetting that one) viciously hacking away at your ears with the gang shouts and hammering riffs only to briefly settle into a sublime melodic picking topped with an ethereal solo just as the song once again picks up the speed and aggression for a while, while the main melodic riff repeats and fades away. This is it ladies and germs. One of the best Meshuggah songs you've probably never heard. Congratulations on your ignorance.\n\nEven if you prefer their later works over this, you need this album just to see where one of the most ground-breaking and innovative metal bands dominating today's scene started out, and this album proved without a shadow of a doubt, that there were unique and untouchable from day one itself. All the way back in 1991 folks. Not a single band could hold a candle to them even back then and the bottom line is: you are seriously missing out if you haven't heard this gem already. Kindly remedy the situation with haste.\n",
        "\nWhen one reads the reviews of 'Koloss', two things are immediately obvious. First, a lot of people love Meshuggah and think this is one of the best albums from a very skilful and exciting band. The second thing is that no one knows how to write a review about this album beyond saying \"It sounds like it's a Meshuggah album but not as heavy as 'obZen' even though it's still great\", which is akin to saying that Deicide play metal or Iron Maiden are good at singing. I'm not exactly a big Meshuggah fan, yet I find 'Koloss' an engrossing album and, with some lacklustre elements, an ultimately rewarding experience.\n\nMy personal history with the album is a bit strange, though I think it might give some insight to why it's special and sounds so different from most other metal releases. In late 2013, I had already listened to 'Do Not Look Down' on a sampler album and, while I was looking for music to provide inspiration for a writing project, I decided that the song might be suitable. As it turned out, it was more than just suitable, providing a groundwork for that small idea, which subsequently turned into five or six poems, a short story, and two essays that I submitted for my master's degree. One quarter of my degree stemmed directly from 'Do Not Look Down'. And what was the nature of the project? It was an exploration of impersonal modernity and the paranoia of living in the city, partly concerned with surveillance, with dislocated power and authority, and something that I liked to call \"concrete anxiety\". Concrete anxiety is the feeling you get when viewing the blunt, colossal, and oppressive city architecture of grey bridges, overpasses, office blocks, alleyways, staircases, and car parks, all of which seem to trap the city dweller in the metropolis. The environment is uniform and controlled, yet is in a complex state of chaos, where the concrete structures criss-cross and intersect in a confusing network, causing people to become anxious and feel less than human, but more a product of machines or prefigured control, such as city surveillance and state authority.\n\nThat description, for me, is an accurate summary of the atmosphere and associations that 'Koloss' stirs up during its length. The repetitve bludgeoning of heavy-duty rhythms and lurching, reinforced guitar riffs doesn't allow the listener to experience any of heavy metal's normal euphoria and energy, except in a kind of dizzying descent and vertigo that the sudden, random, jazz-structured solos induce. The polyrhythms might occasionally feel unnecessary and showy, but their main purpose is to create that sense of entrapment and loss of autonomy that comes from complete alienation and subservience to an inscrutable system. The riffs on 'Koloss' can be split into two groups: the first type fits the rhythmic patterns of Tomas Haake's bewildering drumming and doesn't add much enjoyment from simple guitar sounds, only from those appalling atmospheres; the second type has more of a conventional appeal, not giving hooks to hang onto exactly, but a more generous and satisfying groove that allows the listener's head to clear so they can regain some balance. The first type is most obviously used in 'Do Not Look Down' and 'I Am Colossus', while the second type ensures that 'Marrow' and 'Demiurge' are easier introductions for new listeners.\n\nDespite these different styles, most of the songs on 'Koloss' are cut from the same cloth, using small variations from the core sound to maintain the oppressive atmosphere throughout the album. The rhythmic battery is unrelenting excepting some small ambient and melodic touches in 'Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion' and the doom-influenced 'Behind the Sun', while Jens Kidman's vocals are terrifyingly uniform, delivered in a completely monotone snarl that just verges on Predator-style alienness. This all means that listening to songs in isolation is much less rewarding than being engulfed by the entire album for 55 minutes, since the menace builds and builds to a crescendo in 'Demiurge', before 'The Last Vigil' echoes hauntingly as the eerie fallout to whatever took place. Those who pledge their allegience to Meshuggah and this album particularly must surely be here for the atmosphere, which is like no other, as well as the impossibly dense sound of 8-string guitars, thudding bass, twisting drums, and mechanical vocals that crush your soul and mind underfoot in an altogether discomfitting experience.\n\nStepping outside that experience, though, it's plain to see that Meshuggah didn't have an easy time turning all of their ideas into great songs, since the opening 'I Am Colossus' stands out as a plainer, emptier listen than the others, and 'The Last Vigil' is too forgiving an ending for such an alienating experience. The faster songs, 'The Demon's Name Is Surveillance' and 'The Hurt that Finds You First' would both work much better in the opening position, so that the listener would immediately be pulled into the album, although they don't disappoint in their current positions. There are also parts of 'Marrow' that feel too groovy compared to what's going on around it, since the hooks are slightly too overt and lose the intense focus of the other numbers. However, these are relatively minor issues, since the album stands as a whole with continuous lyrical development to aid the musical themes. A brutal and unfeeling show of power.\n",
        "\nI'm sure we've all heard of Meshuggah since this is a review of a Meshuggah track and let me tell you, this band has made some stuff I loved and stuff I hated. This falls into the second category. It was bland, hard to listen to.\n\nI can't say this sounds like everything else they've made from personal experience because I haven't listened to much but if the descriptions I get from friends and fellow reviewers have any accuracy then it does sound like everything else they've made. \n\nSort of driven by something that is half chugging and half groove in the guitar department. Its a really simplistic, repetitive and boring riff, it did not hold my attention at all meaning I had to listen through multiple times to make sure I wasn't missing some crucial part. It was too rhythmic, I mean Dimebag on a bad day could write riffs more melodic and technical then this and still keep his signature style. It was literally rhythm and nothing else. One thing done over and over for the whole length of the song. This same description can be given to any of their performances and still apply perfectly. I pretty much learned that you can skip from one part of the song to another without it seeming like you've skipped much and I learned that after multiple listens it still failed to grow on me.\n\nSo instrumentally it seems like a flop, what about vocally and lyrically? Vocally its Kidman's (I believe that's his name) rough barks, which he matches up with the guitar rhythm, oh my god even the vocals are pure rhythm. The lyrics are pretty cool, but lets be honest, lyrics are but a small piece of a track, arguably the least important. (I actually think a song's meaning is very important and I like lyrics that are expressive or good storytelling, but point being not everyone feels that way)\n\nIts not all bad though, while the guitar's performance was boring I thought it sounded cool. Most people say its way too processed with too much gain or something to that effect but I thought it sounded pretty cool for the first 20 seconds but without a changing riff or a solo to break the monotony it became stale.\n\nI understand there are some very technical and progressive elements here (polyrhythms) but they only stand out to the musically trained. They also do not excuse the fact that it was boring. Did I mention it was boring already? Because I just don't feel I can emphasize that enough.\n",
        "\nI could go on a long rant here about how people \u201cjust don\u2019t understand\u201d Meshuggah\u2019s music and the skill that goes into what they create, but I will keep this short. I feel on this album, more than any other, the music speaks for itself.\n\nThere are more and more \u201cdjent\u201d acts coming out of the woodwork, and with the surprising variety of sounds from these acts, it easy for new, fresh faces to change people\u2019s perception of the bands that originated it. Unlike many of these other groups, Meshuggah is solely interested in the pure groove and percussive elements of their sound. Melody and complex guitar-work are secondary to the insane rhythms. The vocals are hypnotic and some would say \u201cmonotonous\u201d as they are also part of beat.\n\nKoloss is not going to be a big shocker for people familiar with Meshuggah. The abundance of low-end is there as always, along with the odd poly-rhythms, barked vocals, and freeform jazz solos. However, I feel this is the tightest, heaviest, and most focused they have ever been. The lows are even more crushing, the riffs (though still similar) offer more variety and memorability, and the brevity lends itself well to repeat listens.\n\nWhile past albums have been pretty polarized for me regarding which songs are great and which are skippable, there aren\u2019t any songs I would call \u201cfiller.\u201d Even the long outro is worth listening to as it is the prettiest, most peaceful thing I have heard committed to such an intense album. There are two types of tracks: crushing, and BONE CRUSHING. For the latter, my favorites are Swarm, Do Not Look Down, Demiurge, and I Am Colossus. Note that I just named almost half of the album.\n\nEven if you think you have heard it all before, give this album a few spins. I would be surprised if you don\u2019t find yourself banging your head. The tone feels darker than ever before. Obzen found influences from Tool rubbing off on them from touring, and Catch Thirty-Three felt like they were becoming a little too avant-garde. This is more akin to Nothing, but without the experimentation and influences of the nu-metal culture that were happening around it. This is pure, primal Meshuggah.\n",
        "\n1993\u2019s None is a transitional release for Meshuggah. The dissonant, proggy and polymetric thrash of Contradictions Collapse has morphed into dark, dissonant and technical groove metal with a lot of mid paced riffing. There are still some fast and thrashy riffs on this EP, but there is also an abundance of monstrous, mid-tempo low end grooves like those that are the basis of tunes like \u201cSickening\u201d\u2019s relentless grinding. None sees Meshuggah anticipating the full on industrial/groove thrash fusion-influenced metal of the breakthrough Destroy Erase Improve (who's sound it most resembles, despite being included in the reissue of CC) album two years later. There is more of an ambiance here, with some weird synth passages showing up in both \u201cSickening\u201d and the varied tempos of \u201cGods of Rapture\u201d, which features a startling solo from Fredrick Thordendal. One track, \u201cRitual\u201d, is mostly clean sung by Kidman and starts out sounding uncannily like Alice In Chains before those churning heavy grooves return to back up one of Thordendal\u2019s jazzy leads with machine-like precision. \n\nThe lyrical themes have begun to drift into dark existential realms, instead of the environmental/political and addiction themed songs of the debut, foreshadowing the eventual esoteric direction showcased on later albums like Chaosphere and Nothing. The guitars of Thordendal and Hagstrom (who makes his debut with the band here) are further downtuned on None, and accompanied by rumbling distorted bass which still holds down the majority of the low end at this point (no eight stringed guitars yet). Jens Kidman isn\u2019t quite at his \u201cdrill sergeant\u201d technique yet, more like a melodic shouting with some anguished hardcore sounding vocals, and as mentioned even does some singing. The \u201cgang shout\u201d thrash backing vocals are still present, vaguely recalling the first album, and are used in much the same way. Haake displays inventive and infectious beats as ever, even at this early stage. I especially like what he does with the snare and hi-hat. The overall sound of the EP is quite raw and live sounding, with an urgency that really helps to drive the tunes. Of course, its not as stupidly bassy, or heavy, or as polished as some of the later stuff, but this only an EP and an early one at that.\n\nThis is the first release where Meshuggah\u2019s distinctive drum/guitar interplay begins to really come into focus, which would later define their sound from DEI onwards. Riffs and rhythms seem to shift and permutate subtly over the course of repetitions. There is a quasi \u201cnu metal\u201d feel to a lot of this EP, but its really only there at a superficial level and overall what they\u2019re doing is far more musically interesting. The \u201ctrue\u201d Meshuggah sound arguably begins on this EP, which makes it of some significance in their discography. Personally I think it is a strong highlight of their early career and good companion piece to Destroy Erase Improve.\n",
        "\nExplosive. Searing. Chaotic. Unstoppable. Glorious.\n\nThese are words that come to mind when pondering Destroy Erase Improve. \nThere is a feeling of undeniable purpose to the music, as if it represents the will of some savagely destructive biomechanical being to impose itself on the world. With this album, Meshuggah do their best to destroy and erase the previous metal paradigm, and succeed admirably. Whether they improved upon it is a contentious question that I won't attempt to answer here, but the results are fucking fantastic regardless. Meshuggah have taken thrash metal and warped it into something else entirely, aesthetically new and yet reflective of what came before.\n\nThe exquisite guitar tone and massive overall production can be described in similar terms - thick, punchy, warm, but with plenty of jagged top end. Colossal riffs, dynamic polymetric drum lines, thick distorted bass, screaming vocals, and the swarming insanity of the guitar solos tear out of the speakers without relent, transporting you to some apocalyptic future where Nietzschean cyborg beasts roam the nuclear wastelands and only the brutally insane are capable of survival. Whether they engage in a frenzied speed assault or a crushing midpaced grind, the results are equally enjoyable, and the grin on my face is constant.\n\nThe calm sections that occasionally appear to contrast with the mechanistic brutality of the heavy riffage are beatifully written, with impressionistic harmonies conveying a deep yet deadly sense of calm. The solos are ludicrously good, the work of the fearsome Fredrik Thordendal. If you like Allan Holdsworth, you'll probably enjoy this guy's playing. If you aren't familiar with Holdsworth, prepare to have your mind blown.\n\nOverall, this album is fantastic. It demands a few listens to truly absorb - Meshuggah expanded the language of music significantly here, and it does take some getting used to. If you like thrash, but want something that pushes the genre to a new level, buy this. If you enjoy progressive metal, buy this. If you like metal in any form, buy this.\n",
        "\nThe visual of a mechanical entity experiencing the precursor to what we humanoids refer to as \"the call of nature\" might seem a compelling fit of originality by modern metal standards, as well as by the likes of Rolling Stone magazine and Alternative Press, but minds less bound by the bizarre world of random aesthetic interpretation can relegate such a concept to the commonplace realm of farts. While maybe a somewhat harsh indictment of Meshuggah's pioneering \"djent\" offering Nothing and the hype surrounding it, it stands as a fairly good description of the auditory junkyard of nu-metal influences and jumbled progressive quirks that somehow manage to produce an overtly banal waste of an hour's worth of time.\n\nThe spontaneity of ripping off an impressive one can make for an occasional treat at a frat party or band practice, but it's a bit excessive to sample a couple dozen different sounds of methane expulsion and turn it into a cacophony of mixed meter rhythms with drums triggered into oblivion. To be clear, the organization of the riffs themselves is impeccable, which hints at why the cybernetic aspect of the displeasing aroma causing sounds needs to be underscored. The employment of down-tuned 8-string guitars leaves one wondering why Meshuggah even bothers keeping a bassist in the fold, as it does little more than double the low-hanging rot attempting to pass as groove riffs. Occasionally an atmospheric middle range guitar drone comes in to provide an additional layer of atmosphere, and the semi-frequent employment of guitar solos does provide a fleeting yet needed distraction from the monotony of the arrangement, but their effectiveness is stymied by the pervasive, percussive punches of the overemphasized rhythm guitars.\n\nZeroing in on an individual song is largely a pointless affair as the stilted minimalism of Meshuggah's pioneered style doesn't bother to escape its one-dimensional confines, though one might be able to separate the closer \"Obsidian\" from the pack given that it drones on with even more boring results than its 9 predecessors and lasts almost twice as long. Everything seems to be an exercise in repetition and sectional contrast largely comes in shifting a couple rhythms around here and there, and woe be anyone who expects even a few seconds of this thing to venture anywhere beyond a frustrating slow mid-tempo trot. Likewise, the vocals prove to be a perfect fit for the rest of the arrangement, taking maybe one or two different versions of a mid-90s Phil Anselmo gruff scream and occasionally switching out for a random spoken section. In other words, the vapidity pervades the whole, and no crevice is spared.\n\nDealing with the latest fixation that modern rock listeners drool over is an exercise in discovery, and the discovery often found is that in spite of new fads being a frequent affair, they don't seem to change all that much. The succession from the mid 90s nu-metal craze to what would become djent is on full display here, almost as if Meshuggah simply took a topical mechanistic character with some progressive trappings and simply revamped what was heard on Roots and The More Things Change. This isn't to say that Meshuggah's entire catalog isn't worth a look for those inclined towards groovy modern metal, but the masses and the media will often flock to a band's worse outing and hail it as a new awakening, when in truth, this album is dangerously close to being worth what its namesake denotes.\n",
        "\nA remarkably original take on thrash metal, Meshuggah's debut album is the one that got me interested in them, and eventually allowed me to wrap my head around their highly complex, challenging later material. This album too, is highly complex and challenging, but it has heavy old school thrash vibes that appealed to me right from the start, from Lady Liberty against a backdrop of devastation over the NY skyline on the sleeve to some of the most enormous gang shouts I've ever heard. Despite those undeniable tropes of the genre (not that those are bad things, of course), this is an album that is far more \"out there\" than a lot of other thrash. It has a very experimental feel that places it on a similar level to something like Watchtower in my mind.\n\nIn this album we can see the beginnings of what they would eventually evolve into a few years later, but these are just trace elements. Or rather, the same facets are in place against a different backdrop. A noticeable, yet largely superficial similarity can be drawn to AJFA era Metallica, in that the vocals are sort of like James Hetfield only far more furious and emotional, and the advanced song structure is kind of reminiscent of AJFA, but IMO executed far better and markedly more ambitious. AJFA didn't feature anywhere near as many unusual riffs and rhythms as this, and certainly didn't have the demented sounding (and sometimes strikingly beautiful, as in the case of \"Cadaverous Mastication\") jazzy, psychedelic guitar solos this album is replete with. It seems to me like they took that formula and expanded on it, and created something wholly unique in the process. Like the music, the production is also highly unusual, but effective. I've not heard another album that sounds quite like this one. The drums (particularly the snare) clatter away while the loudly mixed (but not especially bassy) bass guitar buzzes away underneath, alongside the powerful guitar tone. There's a moderate amount of reverb over everything to give it a more spacious feel, which works in its favour, especially the snare drum and those classic \"riot vocals\" which sound akin to an entire football stadium bellowing along to the words. Also worth pointing out are the lyrics which aren't the same kind of esoteric words this band would later become known for, but address subjects such as the environment (that old thrash favourite) and drug addiction. \n\nI'm not usually one for picking apart individual tracks, but every song on this album is distinct and has its own thing to offer, though if I had to pick a single one as my favourite it would be \"Abnegating Cecity\". This is quite complex music, not especially easy to get into, indeed it took me a while...but when it clicked, it happened in a big way. Now I can't really imagine not listening to \"Contradictions Collapse\". It has slowly worked its way into my subconscious and become one of my absolute favourite thrash albums ever. I fully recommend it.\n",
        "\nFar from the robotic chugging djent they would be known for playing in their later years, Meshuggah actually started out as a relatively standard-issue thrash outfit with a deft sense of rhythm and hilariously spirited vocals. For the most part the riffs wander between hints of prog influence to straight out Metallica and Testament worship at times. The vocals, performed by both Thorendal and Kidman, invoke a very bay area feel, conjuring up the likes of Chuck Billy and James Hetfield with a slight Swedish accent, are far from professionally done, and the production is predictably substandard, but none of that matters. \n\nThis demo, for me just as much as Contradictions Collapse, proves that Meshuggah are not a group of mindless chuggers, and actually have some real songwriting talent, as well as a set of serious riffing and soloing chops. All of the songs will reappear on the better produced \"Meshuggah\" EP and \"Contradictions Collapse\" LP, but there's something to be said for the grit appeal here; it's interesting to hear Meshuggah at their rawest, and that they don't need all those studio tricks to sound good. For one song (Erroneous Manipulation) I actually prefer this version to the album version. The version here is longer yet also faster, and has an additional section, and just seems to flow more organically. While most Meshuggah fans will pass this early glimpse of Meshuggah up, there are many treats for those who prefer Meshuggah's older period, myself included, on this gem of a demo. Sure, it might be a bit more derivative than later works, but I'll be damned if this ain't some finger-lickin' good thrash metal. Even though it's a demo, all 4 musicians still put up their A game, and it shows here, since this is just as listenable as their full length debut, despite the gap in production values. Again, a must-have for fans of Meshuggah's earlier music.\n",
        "\nI never understood the hype for Meshuggah. Maybe on Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere they were playing a more spastic and unconventional form of groove meddle with mechanical riffing, but beginning with Nothing any sense of vitality they had was thrown out the window in favor of playing nu-meddle with \"tuned down lower than usual\" guitars and \"odd-time\" drumming. This approach they have taken since the 2000s continues here in a monotonous display of bowel movement noises produced on guitars without rhyme or reason. Some people would suggest \"I just don't get it\", and maybe they're right. I just don't get what's so good about a drummer floundering around brain simple 2 note riffs that wouldn't be out of place on a Korn album recorded on the protools with a guy screaming like a Hyena getting sodomized Deliverance style over it all.\n\nThe song begins and ends the same way. 2 note riffs that sound like bowel movement noises are \"highlighted\" by a clean, effected guitar track underneath it while a drummer attempts to inject complexity by unnecessarily playing up the role of his drum kit in an otherwise simple song. The vocals sound more along the lines of the \"spooky\" narrations Mudvayne or Slipknot would do, so if this is a \"nu\" approach to the Meshuggah sound, at least they're finally admitting they just want to be the artsy-fartsy version of Korn. Over this same riff, a guitar solo that sounds like something John Zorn would have thrown out in the early 90s randomly races in. Finally, we get to the clean Allan Holdsworth noodling over the bass line of that riff... then it occurs to you: not a lot has happened in this song. It literally is one riff played in different time signatures by way of the drummer changing how he approaches playing to this one riff given ornamentation by a second guitar track that either adds clean noodling or bad solos underneath. That's really it. Lyrically, Meshuggah actually display a great deal of intelligence but like any song from them, it feels like ill fitting words thrown onto sparse music that wouldn't be given the time of day if not for their 90s discography and 8 string guitar gimmick.\n\nThe next track is a live recording that, aside from some audience noise in the beginning, sounds almost exactly the same. A clean guitar riff comes in, then they throw on the distortion pedal, then back to a clean track... This band really reminds me of the soft-heavy, quiet-loud nu-meddle from the early 2000s. The fact that Meshuggah receives so much praise is almost scary because the music is so brain dead simple and arranged in such a boringly linear fashion that this comes off as being no more complex than AC/DC. Throw out the calculus and math arguments about the counterpoints (really clean guitar augmenting bowel movement sounds) and the \"complex time signatures\" (really just a drummer changing his pattern around lifeless riffs) and you end up with nu-meddle. The second song features the \"extreme\" vocal delivery of their earlier works, but aside from that it's almost comedic how redundant this band has become. Maybe this is why so many people like them: they're currently occupying the same space that nu-meddle held in the early 2000s, but doing a better job fooling the world that it's actually metal (marketing banter by \"progressive\" fans helps too). Don't believe the hype surrounding this band, but if you're inclined to hear this, it's free.\n",
        "\nIf there's anything a band like Meshuggah's especially known for, it's how consistent they've been with their sound over the years. Much of their work has used their second effort Destroy Erase Improve as the general template, subtly evolving in different ways with each passing record. Unfortunately, one negative aspect of such a strategy is the band's tendency of sounding a touch too repetitive and sometimes resting on their laurels. Their 2005 album Catch Thirtythree, while boasting hints of jazz fusion, was a good example of the group's sound starting to become somewhat stale. So what did the Swedish metal legends unleash with 2009's Obzen? Absolute trash.\n\nMeshuggah have always been a highly regarded group in terms of the instrumentalists' talents, but that does have the occasion of backfiring on a band; unfortunately, that is exactly the case with Obzen. Everything sounds too calculated, too artificial, too cold. While this style is present in other genres/bands (obviously technical death metal is generally infamous for such an approach), almost all of Obzen sounds as if it wasn't recorded by a band, but rather an assembly line of musical parts. The semblance of passion and general energy of previous records is replaced by robotic, by-the-numbers extreme metal that's almost completely devoid of any surprises or stand-out moments (or stand-out tracks, for that matter). \n\nFortunately, the shining light leading the darkness is the opening number \"Combustion.\" The track is reminiscent of older Meshuggah records such as Contradictions Collapse or the aforementioned Destroy Erase Improve, opting for an extremely thrash-esque method of starting the album. Jens Kidman's voice sounds as angry as ever, and the musicians play with an exceptionally commanding presence. The solo is also a nice aspect, highlighting Frederik Thordendal's agility while also showcasing a nice sense of variety in his playing. Unfortunately though, the song only lasts four minutes. The album that follows is an overly homogeneous trainwreck that is only saved by a few choice moments. \n\nWhile the band members do nothing particularly offensive to get such a low rating, my biggest criticism comes right down to the songwriting itself. Much of the album appears to be on autopilot, right down to the riffs that these songs revolve around. Let's take the title track, for example; while the doomy nature of the opening A-tuned riff is promising, the first \"verse\" section is completely uninteresting and leaves a lot to be desired. Jens' vocals sound too aggressive for what's being played, and lack of any embellishments to add to the precise riff make the portion sound unfinished and even unneeded. Moments like these are littered about the album, perhaps reaching a peak with the biggest travesty on the album, \"Bleed.\" \"Bleed,\" considered by many to be one of Meshuggah's greatest songs in their most recent work, leaves me completely baffled about why it is so revered. While repetition can be done extremely well in music (see: Opeth, Earth, Lightning Bolt, etc.), \"Bleed\" preys on one's boredom much more quickly. The main motif is very bland and leaves little to the imagination, and while Thomas Haake's drumming is usually a highlight in the band's music, it's tough to get invested in his drumming on this one. Even when the song speeds up, everything sounds just as mechanical as it did before. The polyrhythms in the song aren't particularly interesting, especially when the band pounds them into your head 50,000 times, and the solo happens to be one of the tune's only saving graces. On top of all this, the song is over seven minutes long... again, not a very wise investment in the long run.\n\nConsidering so much of the review was spent on just a few songs and the vast majority of the album contains the same style, you can imagine I have an absolute trove of problems with this record. Judging by the 1.5, this is definitely true, but I must mention that I didn't want to hate this album. You may not take issue with what criticisms I brought up, and if not, more power to you; the album certainly managed to strike a chord with a large amount of metal fans. I, for one, find it to be a pretty atrocious and dispassionate piece of blandness. Despite the band members' talents, the record they made is an exercise in pure frustration and unnecessary repetition.\n",
        "\nKoloss has an otherworldly bleakness about it, like a deserted planet, with ragged mountain ranges that stretch as far as the eye can see, endless terrains of black brown rock and dust storms that turn the sun to a hovering, ghostly coin. Some people seem to view this feeling of bleakness as a 'boring' element that runs through the album, but I love that. I like the minimalism, the feeling of emptiness; it creates a sensation of space within and around the songs. Demiurge is a good example of this, with its eerie, ambient soundscapes (it grows into something quite sinister for me, cold and chilling towards the climax, which of course I adore) and the multi-layered, slow burning beauty of Behind The Sun. Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion sounds barren and dry until it floods into colour at 3:48 with those long, disquieting tunnels of guitar sound that seem to take us slowly, creeping into points of space. The Last Vigil takes this feeling of space into another dimension, an ethereal, haunting place full of forbidden geometry and strange, bleeding light. \n\nKoloss is intricate, dense and heavy. I love the drumming patterns on Marrow and Swarm and the way the twin guitar riffs slide away from each other like magnets on Marrow. The way the guitar notes on The Demon's Name Is Surveillance build and bend into something high, wild and intense, penetrating and peering into your mind like snaking, living cameras, and how Do Not Look Down seems to flow into a completely different song at exactly the 3:00 minute mark. The way the guitar (it sounds like a weird sliding backwards chord with bending strings) seems to pull my stomach muscles down at 0:18 (there are two more during the song, deliciously heavy, they occur at 1:06 and 3:46) on I Am Colossus, it feels exquisite, like falling through a trapdoor. I love the ascending chromatic riff during the chorus and the lead solo towards the end is beautifully-placed, having a 'siren-esque' quality to it, a little like the melody (or rather the atmosphere) you hear during Corridor Of Chameleons (at 2:02 and 3:55) from Chaosphere. The Demon's Name Is Surveillance has this siren-esque quality as well towards the end section at 3:30. You can hear elements of Chaosphere and Obzen throughout the album and for that matter, elements of Nothing and Catch 33.\n\nKoloss is an alien landscape. Beams of sunlight flicker in broken shafts on that black-brown surface. At certain angles, the light glints like gold upon those great stones. It is full of twists and turns like some leviathan puzzle box. What you find inside depends on how deeply you want to go into that box.\n\nKoloss. Beautiful. Bleak. Barren. Alien.\n",
        "\nAs I prepare my rectum for the Meshuggah concert coming up in the couple of days, I've done a fair bit of introspection; trying to figure out how relevant this band still is in my life, considering they were one the few bands that basically got me hooked on metal in general, back when I was a wee lad. Well this introspection could come have come a better time, because in the midst of this meditative seclusion Pitch Black was released, and unfortunately a lot more heads will be scratched than banged with this 2013 dud.\n\nIt appears as though Pitch Black is Meshuggah's one-click excuse to release another trippy album cover, so it would seem. Consisting of one half-assed rerecording of a song from years ago and pretty solid live rendition of Dancers To A Discordant System, this mini EP clearly didn't take a whole of careful craftsmanship. The issue lies most apparently, not in the quality of the work presented, but its scarcity, reeling in at under 16 minutes. If the tracks given to us were issued as bonus content on a foreign album release not many would complain, as such things can be written off with ease, but the fact a whole separate release was garnered, albeit a free one, is something that will surely irk die-hard Meshuggah fans.\n\nThe title track is easily the most underwhelming part of this release considering it is void of any passion (regardless of how mechanical Meshuggah's passion sounds) thanks to the absence of everyone but Fredrick Thordendal, and his robotic vocoder work. Musically its a cut below what the band is capable of and the production, while passable, lacks the gritty crunch that so efficiently caused hemorrhaging on their previous efforts. The lack of Jens makes the track reminiscent of Catch Thirtythree's errie Mind's Mirrors or something off Thordendal's Special Defects. As such, if were placed somewhere midroad on an album it could at least carry its own weight. However as a standalone effort its lack of climactic release snuffs out its momentum well before song end.\n\nThere isn't much to be said about the live track here; it's good, and just like every other live release this band has made, it almost sounds better than their studio work - especially Jens' vocals which seem more robust.\n\nIf Pitch Black wasn't free, you could bet on finding some angry metalheads at your local HMV, but the fact it was released for free by a goddamn car company makes it worth spinning if you're a fan of the band. However if you're nothing more than a casual fan, you are MUCH better off diving into one of the band's stellar full lengths for your 'shuggah fix. I for one find myself questioning what the motivating factor is for a respectable band to release such a haphazard EP.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah's 2012 album Koloss. Well, what can I say? It's Meshuggah. \n\nWe might as well start off with the general theme. When we compare this to obZen, we instantly recognize the fact that Koloss, in terms of aggressiveness, is somewhat diminished. Koloss has its very heavy moments and its not so heavy moments. I think most listeners will agree that the heaviest song is either 'I Am Colossus' or 'Swarm' - it can definitely stack up to obZen songs such as 'Pravus' or 'Bleed'. However Koloss is significantly calmer and more controlled in its form, and is far more...mature (?) and serious in musical advancement than obZen. \n\nThe album's first song, 'I Am Colossus' is more of a masterpiece on lyrics than the musical backdrop. When one looks at said lyrics you understand the whole feel of Koloss as an album. It gives you the feeling that Koloss presents god-like imagery (see 'Demiurge') and I Am Colossus is possibly the most 'evil' sounding song on the album. Unlike other Meshuggah songs which are in design to throw off the listener, I Am Colossus is almost operatic in nature. A very cool opera if you're asking me. \n\nOther songs I can name which stand out in this album is 'The Demon's Name is Surveillance' and 'Demiurge'. 'The Demon's Name is Surveillance' is one of few prime examples of Haake's stamina in drumming. 'Bleed' from obZen is the other example - both songs are physically demanding and Haake's drumming drives this particular song in a palpitating rhythm. \n\nThe other song I mentioned, 'Demiurge' is simple, but very, VERY effective in its form. Out of all Meshuggah songs, 'Demiurge' is probably the easiest song to grasp. As a result it is innately heavy to anyone who listens to it and with a very memorable rhythm. One of Meshuggah's best songs on the album and incidentally one of their best overall but for completely different reasons.\n\nMy main criticism of this entire album is 'The Last Vigil'. Whilst having a great quality of its own, it has little place in the thunderous nature of Koloss. It is quite easily the most mellow of Meshuggah songs, and as far as I know, Meshuggah isn't known for its light-base songs. Very nice and hypnotic don't get me wrong, but it feels almost placeholder-ish. \n\nIn total, Koloss is a 'colossal' album. Certain songs cleave straight through the extreme-metal/avant-garde genre, and is memorable to say the least. Very heavy, but not as heavy as obZen. Perhaps for the better?\n",
        "\nGenerally speaking, most of Meshuggah's songs have a very unusual, difficult-to-grasp feel to them if you're not very familiar with them. Pitch Black as a song, however is different even for the general Meshuggah consensus. \n\nFirst off, the general feel of the song. For fans of Meshuggah, it can be compared to 'Dancers To A Discordant System'. It has a very low-lying but insidiously menacing theme to it. The riff in general is very typical of Meshuggah and their ability to manipulate one note in unconventional patterns. I could compare it to 'Bleed' in that respect as it has a driving feel to it but not for its tempo - the song is, much like most of Meshuggah's songs, slow and focuses on warping a single element of the song - the riff. The vocals are also very respective of Dancers To A Discordant System as well, for the main part anyway. I'm not sure whether it is Kidman or Haake doing it (my guess is Haake, but I could be wrong) and has this also increasingly menacing theme to the vocals. \n\nJens' trademark vocals then kick in, followed by an incredibly Thordendal-style solo. I myself can't really compare it to any other solo, but my best comparison could be anything from Chaosphere. It's incredibly abstract, and when you hear it first time you can't really understand it. My main word for the solo is 'dissonance' but getting used to the solo afterwards is all you can do to numb the attack. \n\nThe song then breaks into something sort-of-calmer again, but eventually goes into a very heavy riff nearer the end followed by a chorus-style lead. I do have to say hats off to the chorus lead at the end, because it works very well with the clean lead over the rhythm in particular parts of the song. Nicely done if you ask me.\n\nIn total, Pitch Black as a song is incredibly different. If you're a fan of Meshuggah you will wonder first time round as to what's going on. It's generally quite mellow for a Meshuggah song, and by itself is very difficult to compare to. Dancers is the most you can size it up with because of how divergent it is from other Meshuggah songs. \n\nSecondly, Dancers To A Discordant System live. If you know background Meshuggah antics, you'll know that Dancers To A Discordant System was Hagstr\u00f6m's and Thordendal's bane - they intended to play it live eventually and they pull it off very well here judging the somewhat metronome-shattering intro. There is not much to say on Dancers as it is a song from Obzen, and not a unique song by itself. But for live quality, it is almost pristine.\n",
        "\nScion A/V has released a lot of free music by a lot of good artists. Just like it's now accepted that NPR has great taste in metal, it is also recognized that a car manufacturer can as well. For Meshuggah's contribution to the label, they have presented Pitch Black, a two-song ep that is 100% free to download.\n\nThe first song is the title track and as far as the name \"Pitch Black\" goes, it's a fairly adequate description of the music within. Recorded during 2003, it is a peculiarity in that it doesn't sound a whole lot like any other Meshuggah song. The vocals are especially bizarre, but I found them to have an interesting place in this rare number.\n\nTrack two is a live recording of \"Dancers to a Discordant System\" from Obzen. As anyone who has seen them live can attest, Meshuggah shred onstage. The complexity of their songs makes for very interesting performances. \"Bleed\" is a particularly interesting tune to hear performed live and shows off just how great a drummer Haake really is. This live song is also masterfully performed and the recording is very good.\n\nThis release has garnered some criticism for being more of a compilation of old material than bringing anything new to the table. I find this to be false. These songs have not been released before and the fact that Meshuggah decided to allow fans to download them for free is, in my opinion, a good thing. I think this ep, while short, is still a good listen and a nice gift from Meshuggah and from Scion.\n",
        "\nDuring the nineties, Meshuggah pioneered a new style of metal known as \u201cdjent,\u201d which relies on distorted, syncopated guitar tones, polyrhythms, and a level of music complexity that is beyond what many bands at the time were employing. In the past five years, djent has become enormously popular as a multitude of bands have emerged from the scene: Periphery, Animals As Leaders, Textures, Tesseract, Cloudkicker, and Vildhjarta are all acclaimed groups whose music falls into this category.\n\nAs djent grew in popularity, speculation arose as to whether Meshuggah, the innovators of the style, would be able to write music with relevance. When it was announced that the band had a new album in the works, the reaction was generally subdued; many felt that a new Meshuggah album would be derivative and uninspired. On March 23rd, Koloss was released and despite low expectations, the album has proven to be Meshuggah\u2019s best in years.\n\nKoloss does well to showcase the band\u2019s technical mastery as the song \u201cDo Not Look Down\u201d demonstrates. Guitarist M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m helped write many of the heavier songs included such as \u201cBreak Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\u201d and the penultimate \u201cDemiurge\u201d. Meshuggah\u2019s slower side is also revealed in opening track \u201cI Am Colossus\u201d and instrumental \u201cThe Last Vigil\u201d. \n\nThe album presents itself as a varied, progressive record that is less a reaction to current metal trends and more a step back towards their earlier albums Contradictions Collapse and Destroy Erase Improve. It\u2019s done more than just that. In its first week, the album sold over 18,000 copies, landing it at spot number 17 on the Billboard 200 music chart, the band\u2019s best first week debut ever. Koloss shows that after twenty-five years, Meshuggah is still a significant force in metal.\n\n(Originally written for Generation Next in the Santa Fe New Mexican)\n",
        "\nI think by now we are all aware of the ongoing metal oriented initiative run by Scion. The car manufacturer, while oft undermined by the likes of Toyota or Honda, are widely gaining more and more respect in the metal community for their consistent EP releases, which they have been doing for the past few years. Bands such as Arsis, Corrosion of Conformity, Revocation, and Wormrot have all released short EP's through the companies arts label, Scion AV. You can now add Meshuggah to that list. While their last album was released a tad over a year ago, the band released this new EP, entitled Pitch Black, likely as a holdover between the next album. While it only contains one new song, it also contains \"Pitch Black\", which is aptly used as the title of the EP. Is it even worth listening to? Sure, but really only hardcore 'Shuggah fans will like it. \n\nPitch Black is a strange, strange song. The vocals on the track are sadly a bit nu metal aping Jens sort of sounds like Jonathan Davis, and it sort of annoys me. Where is the yelling? What is the trademark Jens Kidman \"I have no inside voice\" sound? I have no clue. Than the real kicker comes in. While Meshuggah are no stranger to off time sounds, the solo that occurs 2 minutes in is just terrible. It almost sounds like they hired Kerry King to come in, shut off the metronome, and told him to play the best solo he could. Yes, Meshuggah play progressive metal, but for how far is too damn far before the music is almost unlistenable? Thankfully they recover, with a minute long proggy jazz fest that eventually leads into the chugga-chugga-chug we have all been waiting for. From there on out, that's it. Yes, in 5 minutes Meshuggah managed to use every trademark they are known for, and use it terribly. In short, Pitch Black may or not be the worst Meshuggah song ever made. It depends really on much of a Meshuggah fan you are. If you're like me, a fan of the early stuff and a handful of newer songs, you may find yourself shutting this off before you even get going. If you love Meshuggah, you'll probably enjoy it more, and may understand it more. Maybe. \n\nThe last track is a live recording of Dancers to a Discordant System, which when put with Pitch Black almost sounds like the exact same song. I feel no need to elaborate on this, seeing as Meshuggah got a little lazy and decided inside of writing two songs, they'd phone it in with one horrendous one and a live track originally made 5 years ago. Sounds like a \"plan\" to me.\n\nI don't know, maybe Meshuggah were busy. Maybe the toilet needed fixing, or the car needed an oil change. No matter what the excuse is, there is no real excuse for how bland, boring, and bombastically lazy this EP is. Pitch Black alone is horrendous, but adding a live recording just so you can have two songs is plain pathetic. If you're going to release an EP, release an actual EP, not one song and you playing some European festival a few summers back. Sorry Meshuggah, you sound tired, weak, and obscenely lazy on this EP. What a way to start the new year...\n",
        "\nSometimes, you'll find re-recordings of albums that were at the time, validated of being a solid re-recorded effort (example: Stormbl\u00e5st by Dimmu Borgir) or exceptionally awful and pointless re-recordings (example: Under the Sing of Hell by Gorgoroth) but above all; some albums take an alternate route in bearing the lines between officially and completely \"re-recorded\" or just reissued with some modifications. Nothing can be beared in as an example for the last critique I just made along with After the Burial's Berzerker album. The reissue of Berzerker by After the Burial was completely re-mastered and had actual drums used in placement of the previous triggered drums...\n\n...However, in terms of Nothing by Meshuggah, we see a lot more complication here. Not only were the rhythm guitar tracks completely redone with updated amplifiers, but song lengths were altered, drums were completely redone and all-in-all it seems that the only thing really left untouched in the end of it all were the vocals, which were not re-recorded, but were given \"extra dramatic effects.\" These complications almost bear the lines upon a total re-recording or just a reissue with modifications, but what most asks the question here is the quality between the two records. The original issue of Nothing and its re-recorded counterpart has always been of much discussion. But what concerns me the most is the disregardance of its re-issue simply because it's \"different.\"\n\nNothing is probably the most recognized Meshuggah album and the band deciding to redo most of the tracks was on their complete decision as it is with bands deciding to re-record earlier songs onto later albums. While the production here is greater, and be it \"cleaner\" than that of the original record, some sacrifices were made to achieve this matter such as the dim and hollow programmed drums used on this version. Tomas Haake did great on the original version, but here the album sounds artificial because of computerized drums being used in response to his actual drumming on the original. \n\nToo many of the songs also sound too unvaried, the original album's tunings that were somewhat different amongst each song's sound come off as exactly the same here merely only because reportedly Fredrik Thordendal and M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m were so pleased with their new guitars and equipment that they wanted to do 2002 all over again. But again, I will admit that some shines persist such as the production, which basically serves as the biggest highlight here which is in-contrast to the production of the 2002 original. \n\nAll in all, I would highly recommend hearing the original version several times before even hearing a track on here. I won't say that this version is terrible; because it's not. The only thing I can recommend is listen to both versions thoroughly and make your own decision on which you enjoy the most and if this big modification/re-recording of the record was really as necessary as the members themselves saw it as.\n",
        "\nIf I had to summarize this album in one sentence, it would be: This sounds like Contradictions Collapse plus Metallica. Now for those who already detected a little bit of Hetfield in Kidman's voice on Contradictions Collapse, on this demo Kidman sounds like a swedish Hetfield. A good chunk of the riffs are clearly Metallica influenced, and one song (Sovereign's Morbidity) sounds more like Metallica than it does Meshuggah. A good chunk of this is the fact that Hagstrom was yet to be in the band (As was Haake), which were two big cornerstones of Meshuggah's sound. Kidman is both on guitars and vocals here, and the feel is definitely different. \n\nHaving described the sound a bit for the reader, I must ask this question: Is this any good? Well, all three songs are fun to listen to, that's for sure. Cadaverous Mastication was later re-recorded on Contradictions Collapse, and it's clearly the most \"proggy\" of all 3 songs here. However, all 3 songs are a delight to listen to, and present to me a Meshuggah before chugging, before downtuned guitars and atonal riffs. This is Meshuggah when they were simply thrash, not post thrash. So expect elements of their future sound (jazzy interludes, Thorendal's soloing) but this is pretty much 80's thrash with the exception of those elements I mentioned. So for those interested in hearing an 80's thrash version of Meshuggah, enjoy Meshullica.\n",
        "\nI was recommended this band a while back by a friend who also happened to be a guitarist. He said that this band was nothing like he's ever heard along with the fact that it's heavy. Oh yes, this record is nothing like any other technical/progressive metal CD. It's heavy alright. And It's unique, and it's obscenely technical as hell with the well-timed poly-rhythms despite the \"riffs\" being mainly power chords that many other technical bands like Suffocation and Necrophagist could pull off if not for said poly-rhythms.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I was, um surprised. It was rather odd. Instead of the general wankery that is found in tech death, we get oddly, but well timed power chords and Drummer Thomas Haake's does not blast the drums insanely fast like the ones found in Dave Mackintosh's or Pete Sandoval's drum performance, but rather, follows the same pattern as the guitars. The songs managed to be heavy with the down-tuned as fuck guitars and Jen's screaming. None of the songs were all that fast, or at all.\n\nFans I know have claimed that this band is an acquired taste, even among metalheads, and now I know why - The music itself isn't that fast, which might be a turn-off to some people. A common thing most praised albums here (Nevermore's This Godless Endevor, Slayer's Reign in Blood, and Dragonforce's Valley of the Damned) are that they're very fast. Metal newbies would merely scoff at this band and mistake the poly-rhythms as mere chugging in a repetitive manner. However, I didn't think these as bad traits that took away from the music. I enjoy slow music every now and then, and some of the bands I like can be simplistic-sounding at times and still be enjoyable.\n\nSo what's my main issue with this release? Well, let's put it this way - THE ENTIRE FUCKING ALBUM IS MONOTONE AS ALL HELL. Yes, this record shows that speed is not necessary to be technical. It also shows that these guys and similar bands like Tool are way ahead of their time as far as technical musicianship goes. But that's all there is to it, sadly. Save for the unique sound and variety in just about everything, they have absolutely nothing going for them. Melody? Soul? Fuck that shit. Meshuggah focuses almost entirely on technical musicianship and mechanical brutality. Additionally, Kidsman is arguably the weakest link of the band. His screams don't start all that bad at first, but it get's annoying as hell later hearing him shout without any soul.\n\nThen I realized something. The overall musical and lyrical themes focus on robotics and the apocalypse in the far future. These guys are not trying to be melodic or catchy, or even fun to listen to. The monotony in near just about everything they do is intentional, for example, Jens Kidsman's vocals sounds robotic and has no variation or actual power and emotion. I gave the song \"Bleed\" another listen and tried to imagine that Jens was a robot trying to do a death metal growl (LMAO at the thought.) instead of a man screaming rather monotonously, and well, the music made more sense. Hence, the unusually high score I gave it.\n\nDefinitely a unique band that can do what they were aiming for, and I will at least applaud them for going for the sound that they were going for. Sadly, I cannot go any higher than a 70 simply cause I could not fully enjoy the music.\n",
        "\nI have never anticipated buying an album more than when it came to this one. For all the hype behind Koloss, for how much of a huge Meshuggah fan I am, for the four year wait between this and ObZen, what an overall depressing feeling it was listening to this for the first time. I thought my first impression would be something like my brain rapidly becoming clouded because of hearing such destructive and decimating track after track, but instead I was just shit on...on my face. The disc itself even looks like a zoomed-out rip-off of the Catch Thirtythree disc which, by the way, if you haven't heard that album, go get it instead of this one.\n\nIf you were expecting anything like ObZen, don't look here. Koloss sounds like Meshuggah went back a step or five or six. There is a feel to this album where you can't tell the songs apart, which makes it extremely hard to pick out parts you enjoy or dislike about the album. There is way too much repetition throughout the album, all the songs have the same feel to them, they all drag on and most have this sort of \"bad live recording\" distortion sound to them. For the most part all the instruments merge together to form a solid black wall of hard-hitting noise. \n\nKoloss has such massive lack of excitement that just killed it for me. Most of the songs are slow and will make you either yawn or angrily press skip. There is no fast-paced vocals and for being Meshuggah, the gods among men of technicality, there is a monstrous absence of it. There are one or two songs worth mentioning, but I won't, so go find them out on your own because I will never remember the names of them and maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of it. There is a song called Swarm that people rave about, but it is no greater than anything else on the album. I guess the best part of the album is if you do enjoy Jens' vocals on other Meshuggah releases, he does sound exactly the same on this album.\n\nSo basically the whole time listening to this, if you're anything like me, you'll be going \"what the fuck went wrong here?\u201d There are weird \"solos\"(?) that sound like broken keyboards stuck on repeat. While still a heavy album, there is either absolutely way too much going on or nowhere near enough. It's a shame when the album itself looks better than the music stored inside. To a new and better future for Meshuggah, here's hoping.\n",
        "\n\"Rational Gaze\" is a very interesting song. The song begins with a very heavy groove, then it works its way out of it as it continues. After that it jumps sharply into a nu-metal groove with dissonant guitar work over it, reminiscent of a less catchy attempt at something like Korn's \"Blind\". The song eventually works its way back into this groove that falls apart as it plays. The guitar riff is in 25/16 with the kick drum following it while the snare and cymbal play a basic beat in 4/4, with the guitar part being played five times through and wrapping up with an extra 3/16 tacked on the end. It's an interesting brand of percussive bludgeoning, kinda like a double-length Hatebreed song minus the charisma. Unless you manage to get focused on it, the song sort of just repeats itself after a few minutes. \n\n\"Straws Pulled At Random\" is the other standout track on the album, with an intro riff that sounds like a bastardized spawn of The DIllinger Escape Plan's \"43% Burnt\". The polyrhythmic nu-metal riffing is pretty groovy here, with some strong bending on low-tuned guitars that reminds me of the funky bass playing of Fieldy from Korn. There's a break later in the song where a clean guitar part comes in and Thordendal starts building up to an epic guitar solo, with some slow melodic playing. The song never gets there and they get back to chugging away as normal. I've been hoping that the band would break some boundaries and rip into a huge melodic solo there, a wish that has been denied for ten years, though the only chance they had to do it was when they re-recorded the guitars a few years later. \n\nThe completion of the album was rushed back in 2002 as they were a last-minute addition to Ozzfest. These two songs were put on a promo CD with two tracks from In Flames' \"Reroute to Remain\", which is an odd pairing other than both bands being Swedish, signed to Nuclear Blast, and blowing in terms of popularity at the time. \n\nSo, about the rest of the album. It's all the same shit. Skipping through the first ten seconds of each tracks will tell you everything that you need to know about this album - there's the polyrhythmic nu-metal riffs that start on a high note, and there's the ones that start on a low note - the band has a terrible habit here of picking a dissonant interval and confining themselves to two notes. It seems like they were doing math homework and occasionally stumbled across something good. That's what listening to this album is like - it's like doing math homework. You can zone out and deal with the feeling of impending dread that this is going to make the better part of the next hour unpleasant, or you can try to count high-speed polyrhythms. Remember when you got to a point in math classes when you wondered why the hell you had to waste time on shit when everything you needed on a daily basis was at an elementary level? This album has all the suffering of math homework with none of the utility.\n",
        "\nThis is a supplement to my review of the original 2002 release of this album.\n\nEven a broken clock is right twice a day. This album sounds like a broken doomsday clock grinding away at several different speeds, clunking between one tone and another, metal whacking metal and producing horrific mechanical sounds and the distorted flapping of power lines being pulled in the apocalyptic storm. As we all know about doomsday hoaxes, the world isn't ending any time soon, and neither is a Meshuggah song, because the ten tracks all sound like varied arrangements of the same two songs. \n\nApparently the rushed production of the original version of this wasn't good enough for Meshuggah, they had to go for the full modern production experience where the music sounds like a wall of robots, rather than some dudes playing guitars and instruments. Everything is unpleasantly mechanical, pushing the sound of guitars as close to slamming machinery as a non-noise artist would attempt. Instead of the thumpy, groovy feel of nu-metal, it's now more like the hammering feel of overproduced deathcore. \n\nThis album is an extensive polishing of some old material so that it has a massive impact based on the sound alone. Listening to one song while surfing through MySpace pages might give the impression that this is the heaviest band in the world. That is an unfortunate consequence of the times. The album as a whole is musically negligible - any minute of it pretty much sounds like any other minute, unless you're analyzing it for math homework. \n\nHighlights: Any 45 second segment of the album, listened to only once.\n",
        "\nWhen I first heard \"Rational Gaze\", I thought Meshuggah were doing something really cool. They repeated an odd-timed riff over a 4/4 beat, repeating it so it lined up differently with each repetition, looping it until it they eventually met up again. There was basically no melody, just choosing a dissonant interval and going between those two notes. The vocalist is primarily percussive, shouting in a monotone, often adding another rhythm to the already chaotic mix. The guitars were tuned very low, and the drummer hits the kick drum in sync with the guitars chugging. It is really cool when you first hear it. Fascinating when you listen to it and write it out to figure out what they're doing (25/16 over 4/4 five times, plus an extra 3/16 tacked onto the last cycle, in that example). \n\nThis heavy, thick, and percussive sound is Meshuggah's signature style, something that became apparent when they did the same thing for close to an hour and called it an album. That was ten years ago, and they did more or less the same thing in different colors for the rest of the decade. There are certainly ways to differentiate modern Meshuggah material from song-to-song, but they're a one-trick-pony with a really complicated trick. They tried to push the boundaries with a drum-machine album. They took a hammering, percussive riff in Bleed and beat it to death by repeating it for what seemed like an eternity. \n\nImagine if Iced Earth made an album that consisted entirely of triplet-chugs and falsetto screams. While they certainly have a style and formula, and their gallops are often joked about, the gallops are basically every other riff, not the vast majority of the album, and they're spaced out and share the spotlight with a lead vocalist. \n\nMeshuggah have refined an incredibly monotonous formula for this album. They have expanded their riffing from a single dissonant interval to often using three notes per riff. They rely on their polyrhythmic cycles heavily, with almost every moment of the album being part of one. This concept could be implemented in an interesting manner - it could be really cool if Ron Jarzombek blended it with his ever-changing 12-tone rows and varying phrasings. Meshuggah are far from this.\n\nI'm sure you have heard a deathcore fan tell you that it's fucking brutal, it's so much more than chugging, it's so fucking heavy, they've got killer riffs, not just drop A power chords. Thick production and mechanical-sounding digital production can make every percussive beat sound as punishing as if you looped the first three beats of \"Hammer Smashed Face\" for an eternity. Complaining about this seems to be a popular pastime among metalheads these days. Don't you fuckin' hate chugga-chugga riffs, man?\n\nMeshuggah are a boring chugga-chugga band who stretch out their chugga-chugga riffs more than the average chugga-chugga band to fit them into their polyrhythmic cycles. Each odd-timed riff is usually longer than a normal riff, since it's in twenty-something over sixteen time and it needs to be played five or six or seven times. To make this worse, they often go to a brief break, then go back to the same shit for another eternity or two (more likely, two and eleven sixteenths eternities). \n\nThe band isn't entirely chugga-chugga riffs this time, since they slowed down the chugging, they've thrown in some \"atmospheric\" chords, such as on \"Behind the Sun\", where they sound like Soulfly trying to rip off Converge's \"They Stretch For Miles\". This is a point where, since I'm reviewing Meshuggah, I'm not afraid to be disjointed and break from forming any sort of rhythm in writing.\n\nThe atmospheric stylings on this album are very poorly implemented. The aforementioned riff is a poor attempt at doing something that Converge or Mastodon might be better known for. While I maintain that the majority of the hate for those bands comes from the legions of terrible rip-offs that they spawned, Meshuggah may have spawned the most loathed rip-off subgenre. Despite djent being the most bitched-about thing since Killswitch Engage, Meshuggah seem to get nothing but praise for doing more-or-less the same thing as a movement named for the sound that a bunch of wankers get by plugging their guitars with too many strings into their computers and chugging through an amp simulator to achieve a dry, synthetic tone. They seem to get a pass from the many opponents of this style and movement, with this album earning endless praise despite playing into the tired stereotypes of this relatively new style. They're just as boring as Periphery, or Animals As Leaders, who have a charismatic bandleader who is known for committing the greatest crimes against fashion in metalcore since Eighteen Visions. If you haven't heard by now, Tosin Abasi gave an interview about his clothing in which he mentions that he is wearing women's pants, \"fashioncore\" was a term that was used when people discovered bands on MySpace, and an American man still wears a fedora after President Kennedy marked the passing of the style by sporting nothing atop a full head of hair. \n\nI would normally avoid digressing into such a lengthy ramble, but if you're listening to Meshuggah, they're probably still wanking in multiple time signatures to the same chugga-chugga riff because its polyrhythmic cycle hasn't wrapped back around yet. They're allowed to do it, because they were the first band to do the same goddamn thing for a whole album, a whole decade, right? \n\nThe prominence of detuned, groove-heavy riffs has not been without merit. One can still chug on a low-tuned guitar without being painfully boring like Meshuggah, who have found a new way of doing it. The Acacia Strain had serious motherfucking swagger until they hopped on the eight-string trend and their Meshuggah-loving guitarist relegated himself to the studio, and then band became boring. Veil of Maya sampled and mocked a YouTube commentator's verbal impression of a breakdown and tastefully finished a song with a serious groove modeled after that man's impression. Bolt Thrower have notably made use of the same riff several times over two decades to nearly universal acclaim. \n\nWhy is it then, that Meshuggah's music falls flatter than the fretboards of their eight-string guitars? They're a one-trick pony, with little in their arsenal other than drop-tuned, eight-stringed guitars where they only occasionally explore most of the instrument, presumably to make sure that it hasn't crept into the shadows to avoid being seen in the poisonous limelight with them. Dissonance and chugging alone get boring long before you push the hour-mark of an album. Polyrhythmic cycles can't disguise that you're a chugga-chugga band with more chops and less swagger than recent Emmure, but roughly the same hammering dynamics as the last Fear Factory album. The vocals are painfully monotonous - the only aspects where there is even the slightest amount of room for variance are the lyrics and the rhythm. Another percussive element, another metal band with metal band lyrics. Dime-a-dozen, though they would prefer to play in loose change over sixteen time. \n\nYet another place where Meshuggah fall short of pretty much every band in the world is the lack of any sort of hook in the music. This isn't memorable, and their complex format needs some creativity rather then primitivity within their chosen polyrhythmic format. This isn't caveman chugga-chugga metal, this is thinking man's chugga-chugga metal! I congratulate you if you think this is the latter and made it past the numerical score of this review, but quite frankly, anyone who uses the term \"thinking man's metal\" deserves to have an eight-string guitar broken over their head. There's no lack of comprehension here as to how these technical chops work, it's the lack of everything else that makes good music that the whole civilized world bitches about being absent when a deathcore band plays two indistinguishable one-chord breakdowns in the time it takes Meshuggah to finish wanking in multiple time signatures at once. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin of this album's torturous sound is that every time they step away from their signature chugging formula, they only pull off something extremely mediocre, only sounding a bit more appealing because by the time they play it - I'm so sick of their chugga-chugga crap that I'm craving anything else. Soon enough it'll be back to the same old chugga-chugga. This album is extremely unpleasant to listen to.\n\nSo let it be written, so let it be done.\nFuck these eight-stringers and then some.\n",
        "\nI\u2019ve mentioned Meshuggah many, many times on my blog. It\u2019s really no secret they are one of my favorite bands, and have done more to shape my musical taste than nearly anyone else. In reading a review of a band as iconic as Meshuggah, you should always be aware of how the reviewer stands, and I must put it out there that this may not be entirely un-biased I pretty much think they can do no wrong.\n\nKoloss is the Swedish experimentalists\u2019 eighth full-length album. Many commenters have noted that they sound more organic this time around, and then struggle to explain exactly what they mean. This is clearly still a Meshuggah album, after all, so it still doesn\u2019t feel natural to our human sensibilities. Think of it this way: Where prior Meshuggah albums are the audio representation of a complex industrial machine on the verge of flying into pieces, Koloss is more like footage of all the activity in a massive ant colony played at double-speed. Organic, yes, but alien.\n\nThat is really the only necessary observation about the record. It\u2019s Meshuggah, but the instruments sound more real, and they sound more like a band\u2014much as they do in their live material. The songs are in their unmistakable polyrhythmic style, but are somewhat simpler if no less bizarre.\n\nIt is a welcome step. In the time since 2008\u2019s ObZen, an entire genre has sprung up around the mechanical complexity of the band\u2019s sound, and constant comparisons of djent bands to Meshuggah have sullied the legends\u2019 name. Some have even called Meshuggah a djent band, although they are no more djent than Psycho is a slasher film.\n\nAnd did I mention the songs are excellent? The only thing it's missing is a real skullsmasher of a track. There's no \"Bleed,\" \"Future Breed Machine,\" or \"Rational Gaze\" here.\n\nThe Verdict: Koloss helps Meshuggah to define themselves, and to distance themselves from the misguided web forum swarms who seek to claim them.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m terribly late on this Koloss review, but this is more spur-of-the-moment than anything. I got into Meshuggah in late 2009 after hearing a few of their singles, notably Future Breed Machine, New Millennium Cyanide Christ and Bleed, the single from their 2008 release, obZen. After hearing Bleed, I went out and picked up obZen as soon as I had the money. At the time, it was the best fifteen bucks I\u2019d ever spent. As soon as I\u2019d learned Meshuggah would be releasing a follow-up to obZen, I began to drool (figuratively, of course) with anticipation. I could only wonder what the new album would sound like. Would it sound like a fast, ear-blasting death ride like obZen, or would it be a skull-crushing return to basics, with a sound more akin to Nothing? I also wondered how Meshuggah would respond to the recent cropping-up of so many copycat djent bands. Would they try to compete, or would they turn the world on its ear with something original?\n\nKoloss is best described as a combination of several of their previous records. It\u2019s got the slow heaviness of Nothing, but it also sounds fast and at times thrashy, like obZen and some of their earlier albums such as Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere. Koloss is not simply a mishmash of styles, however; on this album, Meshuggah seem to have created a more stripped-down, streamlined version of their sound, where it seems that they concentrated more on creating solid riffs than being as fast and heavy as possible just for the hell of it. I am Colossus, Do Not Look Down, Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion and Demiurge are the songs that best exhibit this stripped-down sound; their song structure sounds deceptively simple, and they\u2019re pretty damn heavy. Upon repeated listens, however, one can begin to hear the complexity hidden within these songs. The riffs within these songs have the ability to twist and bend into different iterations without ever losing the initial feel. On the other hand, The Hurt That Finds You First, Marrow and Swarm are examples of the fast, thrashy feel of previous albums. There are some letdowns when it comes to this record. The Demon\u2019s Name is Surveillance seems to be a rehash of Bleed. The riff is similar and the drumming, while not as intense or complex, still has shades of that song within. Honestly, it feels as if Fredrik Thordendal (the songwriter for this song) was either phoning it in or had a song from the last album that he wanted to use. Also, album-closer The Last Vigil is little more than some nice ambient music consisting of one slow arpeggiated riff with lots of reverb stacked on top. It\u2019s a nice way to relax, but rather boring otherwise. That said, Meshuggah have outdone themselves once again. They have proven that they can still completely reset the curve and come out on top. They\u2019ve taken their style in a very logical next direction, and instead of trying to compete with the copycats, they\u2019ve done their own thing.\n\nAs for the band itself, they\u2019ve never sounded better. Oftentimes, metal bands age like milk; Meshuggah don\u2019t seem to have aged a day in nearly twenty-six years. The production is crisp and the sound of the band comes right through. Some may be put off by how clear the sound is; this album is definitely not low-fi, but for a band that have been oftentimes described with words like \u201crobotic\u201d or \u201cmechanical,\u201d it seems to be a good fit. \n\nThe band members\u2019 playing is also sharp. Jens\u2019 vocals still sound excellent, and while a little raspier than he was when he was younger he\u2019s still got vocal power; he\u2019s a commanding presence within the music. Fredrik and Marten both sound fantastic, as well. Not only do they play with energy, their guitar tone feels even heavier than it was in previous albums, sounding more like it did on Nothing. Tomas is still pounding away at the drums, providing the rhythmic anchor and helping to keep the polyrhythms smooth and the overall sound tight. His drumming is mixed well, without being too loud or too soft. The only real problem is Dick Lovgren\u2019s bass, which is often relegated to a distant rumble. Of course, a bassist is often there just to provide the rock bottom of the sonic imprint, so it\u2019s to be expected. \n\nKoloss has quickly become my favorite Meshuggah record, even usurping the likes of Chaosphere and Nothing. It sounds just as good the fiftieth time as it does the first. These guys aren\u2019t just playing well, they\u2019re writing well and still coming up with fresh ideas. At first, four years seemed like an eternity, but it was well worth the wait.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah is a band that for the better part of 20ish years since their recording debut has pretty much stuck to their story. Some missteps here or there (*cough \"Nothing,\"...the programmed drums on \"Catch 33\") haven't been enough to derail them, and they've developed their sound over the years from semi-tech thrash, to riff-based odd-time battery, to their current state as an unrelenting proto-djent aural assault. They seem to be less focused on the odd-time riffs they were known for, and now are far more known for just being in-your-face and for being the supposed forefathers of the latest mainstream heavy music abortion known as \"Djent,\" (yes, this reviewer has a definite opinion on that genre).\n\nBeginning slightly with \"Catch 33,\" escalating heavily with previous masterpiece \"Obzen,\" and now with new release \"Koloss,\" Meshuggah has slowly been leaving the realm of the seemingly odd-time riffage behind. To their own credit, guitarist Fredrick Thordendal has even stated on numerous occasions something to the effect of \"the band doesn't play in odd time meters, we just play AROUND the beat of the 4/4 time signature.\" Thing is, is that the riffage has been getting closer and closer to true 4/4 playing dead on the beat, lengthy though the beats may be. Tunes like \"The Demon's Name is Surveillance\" display a style reminiscent of \"Obzen's\" most recognized single \"Bleed.\" The main motif of the tune is extremely intense with heavy palm-muting and doesn't let up even for a split-second. The song \"Behind the Sun\" brings back a style staple of the band that a lot of times helps to break up any sort of monotonousness that can present itself in a Meshuggah release, that being the rarely-used clean arpeggio...something that the band honestly does so well, yet very sparingly uses, and I believe it is just for this purpose. Tomas Haake is on his damn game on this CD too...absolutely destroying the skins and holding down a hell of a groove, throwing down through this entire damn disc. Same goes for Dick Lovgren and guitarist Marten Hagstrom, and even guitarist Thordenthal is killing it, but I still yearn for far more of the amazing, Holdsworth-esque legato soloing that he used to throw down with reckless adandon. This release doesn't showcase his fleet-fingeredness as much as any Meshuggah release really should. It pretty much is just go-for-the-throat riffing all the way through as far as the guitar work goes. As for vocalist Jens Kidman...wow...all the years of screaming I think is finally starting to shred his vocal cords...I mean, you can HEAR it...REALLY hear it. He has a unique raspiness now that I have never heard before. Truthfully, it makes his voice stand apart from all the others that flat-out attempt to imitate him, and I for one think that's cool.\n\nIn all honesty...if you like Meshuggah, you're in for more of the same here. This is a destructive aural force of a band that never gives quarter or mercy, and you know that already. If you've never liked the band, this disc probably won't change your opinion. As I said, it is more of the same that they've been doing, but maybe just a continuation of the slight regression they've undertaken in recent years. It's not a CD...it's five Swedes taking a brick to your face for close to 55 minutes. Just how we like it.\n",
        "\nWhen it comes to the music of Meshuggah, a lot of things come to mind; technicality, polyrhythmic drumming, experimental structures, chaotic riffing. But revered above all in the holy church of Meshuggah is heaviness. And 2002's \"Nothing\" is the epitome of that heaviness.\n\nPerhaps the least technical of Meshuggah's releases (though it is still quite technical by general metal standards), Nothing focuses on heavy, infectious guitar grooves as well as those odd rhythms and time signatures that mark the group's signature. Each song follows a rough pattern; find a groove, build up, find another, repeat. Although many bands who might try this approach would soon become worn out and boring, Meshuggah gives enough energy, variation and the proper execution to do it well.\n\nThe basis of all this, of course, is the guitar. The tone is crushing, and the tuning is low; as in, as low as possible. The bass is barely discernible, but that hardly matters; the guitar is so low, thick and bassy that the two guitars and bass morph together into one monolith of groove. The riffs are technical, varied and heavy. They're experimental and rhythmically diverse enough to hold your attention, yet perfect for head banging at the same time. The solos are few, and seem to be less technical in some ways than many of the riffs (at least rhythmically speaking), though they fit when applied. They have a less jazzy nature than the solos on Meshuggah's other albums, and serve more as another layer of the groove.\n\nThe drumming is both excellent and multifaceted. It keeps time (very important in an album as complex as this), but does so much more than that. It provides a neccesary backing to the guitar riffs, and completes the rhythm. However, Haake's performance also layers plenty of raw technicality onto the songs as well as accents the grooves, rather than simply going along with them. \"Nothing\" is so steeped in its rhythm section than anything less than a stellar drum performance would let it down. Thankfully, the performance is nothing less than that.\n\nThe vocals are simply another layer to the chaos. Jens Kidman finds a place within the groove to mount his verbal assault, and pulls it off right. The vocals are harsh and chaotic, the lyrics strange a strange, science fiction odyssey. They are a perfect fit for the music.\n\nIf I had to choose one word to describe \"Nothing\", it would be \"mechanical\". The pure technicality of the instruments, combined with the machine-like grooves makes for a wholly different approach to the genre. The album sounds sort of like an army of robots laying waste to a futuristic industrial factory. Only, the robots are shooting detuned guitar riffs and the factory produces odd, technical drum patterns. Overall, \"Nothing\" is not an album everyone will want to swallow, but anyone even remotely interested in the depths of extreme technical metal will want to take a bite.\n",
        "\nPart of being young and in the underground is you get exposed to the various trends, and the big one right now is the \"djent\" genre. In it's current incarnation, it's essentially metalcore that wholeheartedly embraces wanking of the highest order. But going deep into the Meshuggah back catalog (the roots of the trend), what we get is experimental/progressive groove metal. Imagine the likes of early Machine Head and post-CFH Pantera with a good deal of industrial influence and a fuck ton of creativity.\n\nI would compare this to a half-way point between the over-the-top wank that would later manifest itself on Gorgut's \"Obscura\" and the half-thrash groove of the early nineties. Vocally, Jens projects a half hardcore/half thrash yell that is somewhat reminiscent of Hetfield on the early Metallica albums, but points more towards the NYHC scene. Production wise this album is very good. The guitars have a nice, clear crunch; bass has a heavy presence at the top of the mix; and while the drums are triggered, they don't sound entirely fake and have a nice punch. Like I previously mentioned, the riffs are essentially a technical exaggeration of really early groove metal. While there is a good deal of homogeneity and synchronicity between the band members, there are sections (primarily the grooves and breaks) that make good use of poly-rhythms. \n\nPositives: heavy riffs, heavy production, decent groove/hardcore vocals, and a tense mechanical atmosphere. \nNegatives: the tendency to go off on bland and uninteresting tangents and an overwhelming sense of sameness on each track. For fans of groove, post-thrash, experimental/avant-garde, and industrial, pick up for $10 or less.\n",
        "\nOf all Meshuggah albums that get the most listens, this one would have to be it. It represents an era in Meshuggah alone; where as None - Chaosphere represented crushing polyrhythms that got increasingly faster, and how Nothing thru Catch - 33 saw Meshuggah exploring the possibilities of their music as conceptual art, Contradictions Collapse an album alone. The music here is speed metal with great use of polyrhythms and progressive song structures. The sound resembles if Kill Em All thru Master Of Puppets Metallica had decided to get music lessons and made progressive speed metal, and even Jens Kidman resembles early James Hetfield if he had a slightly gruffer voice more akin to a drill instructor. \n\nThe style here is unrefined, sure. The album sounds like it was recorded with relatively good equipment in a large garage, with room-size reverb on all the instruments. This gives the drums a bit more kick in the mix, and this was DEFINITELY before Haake started using triggers, so the sound here is more spacious and pulverizing. Whereas later albums resembled being beaten to death by cyborgs, this is more akin to a drunken fight with a biker on meth who is clearly bigger, stronger, and able to fight than you. Subtle, yes, but there's something inherently more organic and earnest about Contradictions, whether it be the half-sung, half-shouted vocals, or the use of standard Eb tuning (before they used 7 string guitars) that gives this a more \"retro\" feel. \n\nMake no mistake, though, this is punishing. Most songs go by at a quick pace with drumming that feels less like a drum machine and more like someone who practices a crapton and sacrifices his social life for drumming perfection. The rhythms are mostly headbangable, and that I feel is another area of genius for Contradictions: they got really technical (the guitars are way more technical than their later stuff) without losing the headbangability. In fact, I would say this was when their progressive influence was at its peak, or at least one of the times that it was. The predictability of later works is simply not present here. So, to summarize, the music is spastic, grinding, and stomping, as compared to later works which are more robotic in comparison. \n\nThe songwriting is generally cyclical in form; there are few verse - chorus -verse moments, and mostly what you will hear are themes that come in and out of existence, and are recapitulated later, often in a different form. Some riffs will be more central to the song than others, but the structure is often not apparent until later listens. And did I mention the riffs? There's a whole lot of them here. Each song contains enough riffs for 2 more songs, and boy are they good riffs. Hagstrom gets to shine here; unlike later albums where he goes into Thorendal's shadow, he gets to shine here. The guitars, unlike later albums, are not synchronous most of the time, which gives this album a dimension that is absent in some of their other albums. \n\nIt's a dead shame this album is overlooked so often, because it's chock full of creation and thrashy sections. It makes me want to get behind a drum kit and bang my head while banging out thundering double bass. It's what makes you wanna get up and destroy something. It's responsible for 50% of my speeding tickets. And, most of all, of every Meshuggah album I have, this one gets the most listens by far.\n",
        "\nAfter the immense success that followed Meshuggah upon releasing what is considered to be one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time (ObZen), one question remained: How can they top that? By writing insane and technical riffs BEFORE(!) they even knew how to play them that set the bar to skyscraper proportions for the band\u2019s new album Koloss.\n\nThe first single \u201cBreak Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\u201d was either loved or hated by listeners. It is a much slower and spaced out track, being almost seven minutes long. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they got any less technical. This track shows a brand new side of Meshuggah, where they use the seemingly random time signatures in a whole new way that, to the best of my knowledge, hasn\u2019t really been heard of before. Releasing this track as the first single was bound to put fans on both sides of the fence. It\u2019s not really anything that they\u2019ve delved into much in the past, as they were busy pushing the very boundaries of how progressive math metal should be made while utilizing speed and technical time signatures together.\n\nLuckily, \u201cThe Demon\u2019s Name Is Surveillance\u201d goes back to the insane speed that made ObZen such a hit. If you look up brutal in the dictionary, you will find one of the descriptions being this song. The amount of skill it takes to keep such a progressive and extreme speed for the entire track is mind-boggling to say the least. The way the guitars and drums work in tandem about 2:10 into the song, the way the bass and drums tear your face off, and the solo at the end make this is one of their greatest tracks ever.\n\nGoing back to their Chaosphere days, \u201cThe Hurt That Finds You First\u201d is a more in-your-face approach that is more fitting of an older era. It\u2019s got a slight thrash influence, mainly in the tuning of the guitars, and the overall composition in how the solos and bridge sections of the song complement each other. The drums also ooze pure thrash, sounding different than the rest of the album with the way the snare is used. But it still goes to a progressive sound at some parts in the song, most evidently around the 2:30 part. Near the end, the progressive and thrash elements meet in perfect harmony in a way only Meshuggah can pull off.\n\nThere are many unique elements hidden within every song on Koloss, but that is to be expected of a band that has written such a pioneering and unique page in metal history like Meshuggah. While I won\u2019t venture to say it\u2019s better than ObZen- that\u2019s only a matter of personal opinion. I can see others proclaiming how the uniqueness of Koloss is better than ObZen in many ways. However, it\u2019s not too much to say that it\u2019s in the running for metal album of the year this early into 2012.\n",
        "\nHow can you not love such an amazing album? They ask. This is Meshuggah's best work yet. I elaborate as to why I think differently; never in my life have I anticipated an album as much as I have for Koloss. So I got the album and naturally listened to it, expecting to have my jaw dropped down to the ground instead I was left unsatisfied and rather disappointed. I have only been listening to Meshuggah for a few months having come across the single \"Bleed\" whilst searching for another band, taken aback by Meshuggah, I had to do some heavy research and possibly listen to more of their songs. My denouement, ObZen is truly more of a powerful album than Koloss, ObZen, which was rather heavy and possibly Meshuggah's best album in my opinion. \n\nKoloss has ten tracks, only liking three... Them being; I am Colossus, The Demons Name Is Surveillance and Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion. Meshuggah is a rather complex band and possibly not everyone's favourite cup of tea. But really, what the hell happened here? I was expecting more or less the same brutality I heard in ObZen, Chaosphere and Nothing. To me it seems as though the songs were quickly done and merged in a way that the band made sure that they will be entirely different from their previous albums but that's alright and that is not the problem at all. I have never had a problem with bands changing their sound and nor am I saying that Meshuggah have changed their sound but the saying \"job well done\" cannot be said for this album. It is as though they couldn't wait to evade from the studio and go out and play live gigs and have yet another album done next to their name. Koloss lacks something, more energy perhaps? Again, sheer brutality? It is always a good thing to listen to an album and be hooked from the beginning until the end and not be left dissatisfied. Meshuggah is a great band with amazing talented artists who I feel could have disembogued their heart and souls out on this album, I suppose that is the one thing that frustrates me about this record, it has killer songs but you get the inevitable feeling of boredom halfway through them. Behind The Sun, Marrow and Do Not Look Down can be placed under that category. \n\nThis album is not the \"right\" album to give to a beginner who has never listened to these Swedish guys and would love to try them out because I am almost certain they will rebuke it immensely. I can only hope they will not disappoint with their future albums or I might as well disown themnow.\n\nOriginally written for Sputnikmusic \nhttp://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/49480/Meshuggah-Koloss/\n",
        "\nEvery few years evolution in metal leaps forward, surpassing conventions, some remaining true to their roots while some others drifting off into uncharted territory. Amidst this, some bands maintain their supremacy and produce album after ass-kicking album to establish their dominance and strengthen their foothold on their status. Meshuggah are one such band who do the latter, fueled by originality and innovation, they uphold their brand of metal like no one else, continually scaling new altitudes.\n\nKoloss is their sequel to their 2008 venture obZen, an album that is as captivating as it is mesmerizing. Truly at the forefront of innovation, though some seasoned Meshuggah fans claim it takes a while to assimilate, I maintain it struck with it\u2019s first blow and did what Meshuggah do best \u2013 obliterate. The absolutely heavy 8 string notes resonate with pulsating arrhythmia. The album, which focuses more on being heavy rather than fast and aggressive does nothing short of giving the listener the feeling that a thousand tonnes of bricks is being lowered upon his skull. A vicious journey from I am Colossus to The Last Vigil, demented and groove laden. Majestic in every breath, accentuated by Jens Kidman\u2019s ferocious and authoritative growls. The best parts of the album being the slower tracks, the faster ones seem lost in profundity as one can see on The Demon\u2019s Name is Surveillance. Despite a few glitches Meshuggah maintain their lyrical prowess (the one thing that got me into them a good four years ago). The Hurt That Finds You First is a fine portrait of their linguistic supremacy. Thordendal\u2019s trademark guitar-only parts impart more life and purpose to this work of art. Marrow is clearly the predatorial song on the album, unforeseen in its eccentricity. This coupled with the next track Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion just about sums their signatorial metric insanity. The song gives out glimpses of their sound from the Nothing days. While Demiurge is in possession of a different sound all by itself, perceptible in a completely different way, what one journalist described aptly as \u2018auditory physics\u2019. The Last Vigil is an acoustic meltdown, bringing the album to a shuddering stop.\n\nMeshuggah aren\u2019t a band that have instant appeal, they maintain their affinity towards off times and poly rhythms. They shake the foundations of convention with unmatched intelligence and they do so as if it comes naturally to them. Breaking free from norms and delivering masterpieces one after another, they take metal to heights it has never scaled before. A band that cannot be perceived unidimensionally. Koloss is an album that does every bit of justice to the adjectives used to describe it, a different flavor of lethality for the ones who like it, a savagery unparalleled, an insanity that\u2019s truly Alive.\n",
        "\nFor their most recent full-length album, Meshuggah have created a truly destructive behemoth. The only track on here that gives any room for the listener to breathe is Track 10, but it is a welcome breath as the first 9 Tracks will rip your face off. \n\nMusicianship: Just like albums prior to this one, Meshuggah still hold their unique sound. Down-tuned guitars, odd time signatures, unique polyrhythms, and technical drumming all help comprise the innovative sound that is Meshuggah. This album is filled with slow chugging riffs (Tracks 4 and 7 for example) as well as faster paced riffs (Track 2 for example). Many people complain about how Meshuggah songs all sound very similar, but that is not a downside in this group. Each track on here, except for Track 10, is ridiculously heavy and precisely played. The album carries itself well due to the fact that it is not only heavy, but it also manages to have groove to it. Meshuggah are a very special group in this regard as they do not sacrifice the addictive qualities of their music while still retaining all of their ferocity. Guitar solos are few and far between on this album. However, the music itself carries enough weight on its own to the point that guitar solos aren't particularly necessary. The guitar solos that do show up on this album are definitely a nice touch and add some flavor to the album. The only reason that I didn't give this album a 100% is due to the final track on this album. It's an ambient track which makes for a nice outro, but it is so repetitive that it becomes boring before you listen through it once. \n\nVocals: Jens Kidman's vocals pierce through the onslaught of guitar and drums very well. He has a voice which is very unique in the metal community and I have yet to find somebody who sounds anything like him. His vocals mix with the music being played perfectly and give the music even more fury. The vocals do not overpower the instruments and vice versa. The both perfectly complement one another. \n\nLyrics: Contrary to the popular belief that metal contains nothing but mindless talk of killing people and worshipping the devil, Meshuggah write more intelligent content. The Track named \"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\" is actually a line taken from Albert Schweitzer who was a famous philosopher from 1952. I usually don't pay too much attention to lyrical content in metal bands and instead focus on the instruments and overall sound of the group, but Meshuggah's lyrics catch the listener's attention. Jens Kidman also does an exceptional job of being a destructive vocalist while allowing the listener to make out the lyrics easily. \n\nI think that this album is one of the best, if not the best album by Meshuggah. Fans of the band will be very pleased with this offering and if you have yet to check out this album, I strongly encourage you to do so. Meshuggah will forever hold a special place as one of the greatest metal groups to walk the earth. \n\nBest Tracks: The first 9 tracks on this album are all fantastic, but my personal favorite would have to be \"Behind the Sun\".\n",
        "\nNow, I've been anticipating Koloss like the fucken second coming of Christ. Never have I been so pumped about an album as with this one. Were my hopes too high? Hell no, they weren't even close . Fuck me sideways, upside down, backwards, pretty much any fucken way you want. God help us all. This is what will make the world end in 2012.\n\nThe band themselves said that this album would be a bit more \"straight forward\" than, say, ObZen. A bit more back to their roots, if you will. Something I'm sure is welcomed by many a fans. Because this is what Meshuggah are the undisputed kings of. Yes, they sure as hell know how to absolutely fuck things up beyond mere human comprehension, but I don't think that's what they are truly about and most certainly not what they do best.\n\nI'm gonna sidetrack a little here, but hear me the fuck out, will you? No? Well, fuck you.\n\nobZen felt to me like an experiment from the band. And people who got into the band through that album might have got the wrong impression of what they truly are about. (I'm mainly looking at you, \"djent\"-people). Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love obZen as I love every other album they've done. But it's not about how fast or technical you can go with Meshuggah, it's how heavy, or with this album, colossal you can get. They are, in the end, about creating mindbending sonic experiences. Cosmic greatness. And since obZen, unfortunately, spawned this absolute fucken pile of manure people call \"djent\", I couldn't be more happy with their direction on Koloss. Thank you, Meshuggah. You have just absolutely ass-raped the \"djent\"-scene silly. I love you even more than I did before.\n\nI just felt like I had to clarify that. Hatemails from djentsters are expected and by all means more than welcome. I could use some free entertainment. Ha! You've got nothing on me.\nNow let's get back to Koloss, shall we? Right.\n\nWith their two released tracks, \"Do Not Look Down\" and \"Break Those Long Song Titles\", I had mixed feelings about what to expect. \"Break.....\" is one hell of a monster track, alright. Relentless, goddamn straight to the point bulldozer heaviness, right there. Not much to discuss, really. \"Do Not Look Down\" is, on the other hand, ridiculously groovy and it pretty much makes me want to dance the fuck out to it. Well, not really dance, that would just look plain retarded. You wouldn't want to see me dance, trust me. There are enough awful things in this world as it is. I don't even know where I'm going with this myself. \n\nAnyhoo, I was not really sure what to expect, but I thought it'd be wise to wait until I've heard the entire album before my verdict, naturally. Well, duh.\n\nWell, those tracks definitely shows two sides of the coin, alright. but they certainly do not show what the entire album actually has to offer. This is like all of their previous albums had sex with each other, and Koloss is the sick, demented and dark offspring that came out. \nThis is heavy as fuck, it's groovy and it's fucken evil. In other words, they focus on all the things that they can execute like no other band out there. It's safe to say that they are back, and they're fucken pissed off. This blows obZen right the fuck out of the water.\n\nWhat I like the most is the production. It all sounds like actual instruments again. Everyone shines through so well on this album. Rather than having a compressed-to-clusterfuckness sound like on obZen they went for a more organic and alive sound. Best point of reference would be the Nothing album, but warmer. You can actually hear how an amazing drummer Tomas really is again. Also, Fredrik and M\u00e5rten has to be two of the tightest goddamn rhythm guitarists out there. \n\nThe bass is there sometimes, sometimes it just blends in completely with the guitars, but this is because when they play the low 8-string stuff, Dick plays in the same octave as the guitars, thus giving them that characteristic guitar sound. As far as I'm concerned, he is a damn fine and way too underrated bassist. He even gets some spotlight in \"Break...\" with a kind of a drum and bass interlude, something you haven't really heard since DEI, more or less. \n\nBut what probably struck me the most is Jens. His vocals sound so much more inspired and pissed off than on obZen. Something or someone must have pissed him off before entering the studio. He is definitely back in the shape he should be. Which is something you can't say that often about vocalists, so this is a huge plus. Few people can compete with his badassness and he definitely puts the icing on the cake, the cum on the face, and the gr\u00e4dde on the mos on this album. His live facial expressions alone should be enough to have people fucken throw all kinds of awards at them.\n\nThe musicianship is just out of this world. But this needs no further ellaboration, I'm pretty sure most people are familiar with their skills at this point. Just listen to the damn albums if you don't know what I'm fucken talking about. \n\nAnother point worth mentioning is the lyrics. Tomas writes pretty much all of them, and he is a natural talent at it, too. They make you think, they are interesting, and they all have meaning to them. They give the songs further dimensions and fits them like a glove while at it. Do yourself a favor and put on some good headphones and listen to this while reading along in the booklet. Fantastic.\n\nAt first I decided that to write about each track was a good idea, but it just proved to be pointless and it turned out a little too long to keep the read interesting. I'm pretty sure that you don't have the same feelings about the tracks as I do, anyway... So fuck that shit.\n\nKoloss is heavy, it's atmospheric, it's groovy, it's evil, it's apocalyptic, and it's pretty much everything that I absolutely have come to love about this band over the years. It is a mix of what they've done in the past and it is a perfect representation of what they are. It's the soundtrack to the entire galaxy being crushed into a black hole. And the final track of the album, an instrumental clean guitar interlude (which is also something they are fucken excellent at, Catch 33 would be a perfect example of this), is the emptiness and dead silence of space that is all that remains afterwards. This, folks, this is what Meshuggah are all about and are the unmatched masters of doing.\n\nConsidering all of this and the overall good flow that this album has, I cannot give this anything less than a full score. Call me a fucken fanboy if you want to. I totally am, so I'm all fine with it. Like, I don't even care. Koloss certainly lives up to its name.\n\n10 out of 10 Colossuses.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah has always been a hit and miss band for me. They're capable of some absolutely brilliant, seamlessly elegant musicianship which has undoubtedly pinned them as heavy metal giants. However, there have always been a few things which bugged me. For example, every Meshuggah record thus far has some of the most blatantly tedious and frustrating vocals you'll ever hear. Sure it might sound good and fit in with one track, but to have 8+ songs of that type of screeching vocals is not my cup of tea, nor is it particularly intriguing for others I would imagine. \n\nHere, we get a lot more of the same formula. Now, the first track I picked up on this record was \"Bleed\", and I must say, I was immediately taken aback by how phenomenal and downright brutal it was. This was pure ingeniousness from my perspective, as it garnered all of the best elements Meshuggah had become known for. Very awkward, bizarre riffing that has never been replicated before or after, some crazy drum beat and an intense delivery on the vocal end as well. \n\nHowever, the remainder of the album is just more of what we don't want to hear. Sure, \"Combustion\" might pick up much needed pace and maintain those thrash elements we all love to hear, but besides that the band's composition is intrinsically boring and inept. Many riffs sound like they're the product of guitar genius, and they probably are, yet to counteract them you mix of really strange fillers and vocals which just don't stop. Most of the lyrics are baseless and mundane, although some are quite good, but because the vocalist's voice never changes, never even alternates, its hard to enjoy them for so long.\n\nTo conclude this review, I think Meshuggah have induced a positive vibe amongst their extensive fanbase because they're so talented musicians who have really been writing and composing music thats unmatched in the history of well, music. Crazy ideas make for crazy songs and Meshuggah definitely epitomize that statement. However, they'll never be able to appeal to the broader heavy metal community because their songwriting, while brilliant on some tracks, is simply not good enough on others.\n",
        "\nSo here we have Meshuggah's seventh album, Koloss. After how outstanding obZen was, you'd be forgiven for expecting Meshuggah to even match it, let alone surpass it. However, I believe they have surpassed it with this. While thousands of bands either embracing or wanting to disassociate with the djent label are ripping them off, Meshuggah are showing that they are the masters of the style and why the legions of mediocre clones should just give up.\n\nStarting with the slow paced groove filled track \"I Am Colossus\" which is a strong opener, before going into the considerably faster paced \"The Demon's Name Is Surveillance\", the band have made an album equal parts slower chugfests and faster. The equal mix means you won't feel like you're hearing the song being played over and over. Jens Kidman's robotic bark is still an integral part of Meshuggah's sound, while the memorable jazzy solo work adds a touch of excellence to the whole thing. Tomas Haake is yet again showing why he's one of the best drummers in metal today. His performance in tracks like \"The Hurt That Finds You First\" and \"Demiurge\" are really spectacular. Those ambient passages you heard on Nothing and obZen are still here, the outro to \"The Hurt That Finds You First\", the intro and outro to \"Demiurge\" and the entirety of closer \"The Last Vigil\" being prime examples.\n\nMeshuggah have really outdone themselves here. This is a truly excellent piece of work, and will probably be the album of 2012. Fans of the band will likely love this as much as I do. The detractors will likely not enjoy this much, as it's not anything particularly new, but in the end that's not a bad thing.\n\nHighlights: Demiurge, The Hurt That Finds You First, Do Not Look Down, The Demon's Name Is Surveillance, I Am Colossus\n",
        "\nMeshuggah. That band that mesmerized everybody with their musicianship. Their polyrhythmic structures, brilliant drumming, diabolical low end guitars and guttural vocals, they spawned an entire race of fans and musicians, most of whom have started ripping them off and started the whole djent movement. But when there are millions of good, mediocre and bad copies floating around, how do you identify the original?\n\nThis is where the cerebral side of Meshuggah comes in. What people have duplicated is the sound and song structure. What they have not, is the attitude, intelligence and ideas that Meshuggah put into their songs. They know when they have to play slow and chug and when they have to pace up and poly rhythmisize the space time continuum. And that cerebral side is what shines through on Koloss.\n\nFrom the supercharged \"The Hurt Finds you First\" and \"The Demon's Name is Surveillance\" to the slow chugging on \"Do Not Look Down\" and \"Marrow\" to the doom filled ambient notes of \"The Last Vigil\", Meshuggah do not let the current movements in metal influence them. While the instruments are already known for their prowess, Jens Kidmans' vocals definitely do shine through and stand out. \n\nMy favourite tracks on the album still are the ones that were leaked intentionally by the band, \"Break Those Bones Whose Sinews Gave It Motion\" and \"Do Not Look Down\", especially the latter with its slow groove and jazzy guitar solo. \n\nSo those who are worried that Meshuggah will sound dated and obsolete, can rest easy. This is the most accessible Meshuggah album yet, at the same time being a logical evolution to their speed and riff crazed Obzen. The excellence and the essence that made Meshuggah the favourite metal band of the metal world, still remains. Buy it. For sure.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah are one of the most influential metal bands to ever exist. The mere guitar tone o Fredrik Thordendal has inspired an entire 'djent' scene in modern metal, after all. They are a band whose detractors even acknowledge their sheer talent and accomplishment as musicians. Sadly, I would have to include myself as one of those detractors. While their (at the moment) latest album 'ObZen' wowed me, most of their discography passes me as being painfully monotonous, without much in the way of surprises or emotion. Despite a fancy re-cording, Meshuggah's re-recording of their album 'Nothing' still does little for me. Their music is technically impressive and they do brilliant things with the one apparenty musical idea they work with, but as a whole, there is something about 'Nothing' that is sorely missing.\n\nAnyone who has heard Meshuggah will know that the band has a very clear sense of style, and they are rarely keen on deviating from their chosen course. In Meshuggah's case, their music revolves around chugging guitars, heavy drums, and the robotic, aggressive vocals of Jens Kidman. Occasionally, Thordendal will throw in a brilliant jazz solo, but this concept of having the entire band function as a rhythm section is what drives Meshuggah forth. In the case of this re-recording, Mesuggah sought to redo 'Nothing' due to poor circumstances revolving around the recording of the original. At the time of the original 'Nothing' recording, Meshggah did not have the 8-string guitars they wanted for the job, so they had to settle with something less bass-heavy. The result was a less meaty sound, and while other measures have been taken to polish up the sound of the album- including a redone drum production- 'Nothing' remains very much the same album that listeners will have possibly heard before.\n\nPerformance-wise, Meshuggah are a group of musicians who know what they want, and pull it off with flying colours. Despite the legions of soundalikes, there is not a band out there that really sounds like Meshuggah. On the other hand, Meshuggah's sound here is quite narrow, almost never straying from the prescribed chg-chug rhythms. The band's music has inspired a joke that they have only ever used one note in their entire career, and while that's obviously an exaggeration, it makes a bold point. The rhythms of Meshuggah are powerful, but it comes at a total loss of melody and emotion. Jens Kidman's soulless bark does not help things any; despite philosophically sound lyrics, the shock value of his aggressive vocals wears off within minutes. 'Nothing' is a technically impressive album, both in regards to the old and new version, but much of what I enjoy most about music seems to have been overlooked by Meshuggah.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah is a band that is difficult to fully nail down, not so much in terms of their sound, but more so in their popularity. The whole notion of a band that lives in some borderline between the skewed dimensions of hypnotic repetition and progressive extreme metal just doesn\u2019t really seem to jive with the Pantera fanatics common to the former category, or the dark industrial crowd that eat up the discord and contrast of the neo-tonal harmonies implied in each wicked chord stomp. But one thing is for sure, the little niche that this band has carved for itself in the post-thrash scene is definitely unique, and brings with it a distinctive take on how to complexly articulate how pissed off you are at the world while contemplating all the different ways it\u2019s destruction could be engineered.\n\nKeeping all of the usual stylistic trappings of the band in context, \u201cObZen\u201d actually manages to come off as being a sort of Zen-like meditation album, but superimposed upon a template that is more hellish and apocalyptic than it is restful and enlightened. From the raucous and rhythmic riffs that drone with the thud of a massive golem pulverizing boulders underfoot in \u201cPineal Gland Optics\u201d to the rising feel of an elongated bend riff with a percussive edge in \u201cBleed\u201d, the consistent sense of this album is one of perpetual violence, albeit slowed down to a mid-tempo crawl and channeled through a musical illusion of infinite regression. Even with a few strategically placed quiet sections to contrast with the otherwise constant heavy onslaught to function as place markers, these songs all but lack a true beginning or end to speak of.\n\nTherein lies the fatal flaw of this album, and ultimately what keeps it from fully winning me over; this album is less than an hour long yet it feels like it is well over 2. The songs all run together, as if the band is playing off of the same riff set with a varying number of notes added in or taken away, and actual contrasting emotions or depth fail to emerge. Even when quieting down, the mood doesn\u2019t really change from being a one-dimensional expression of anger, and the raw, vicious shouts of Jens Kidman lose their punch a couple of songs into the listen. Taking into account the layering of effects driven clean guitars lend a little depth to the listen, but ultimately prove to be little more than window-dressing on an otherwise completely uniform structure. The only song that really manages to stand out and offer a somewhat interesting switch in direction is \u201cDancers To A Discordant System\u201d, which really plays up the mixed rhythms and quirky note groupings to the point of literally sounding like a man with seven legs trying to dance in time.\n\nThis is the sort of album that can be enjoyed for an occasional spin, though it works much better if not listened to all the way through in a single listening. A lot of time it stops being extreme and aggressive and just sort of fades off into simply being there, taking up space while one\u2019s thoughts drift elsewhere. It\u2019s actually something of an oxymoron that a band hell bent on making a point about how twisted and disturbing existence is or will be in the future, put together music that will have a hard time maintaining the attention of most who eat up those subjects on a regular basis. This is a band possessed of a very obvious raw musical talent in addition to technical ability, but unfortunately lacks a clear method of focusing them on this album. It\u2019s sort of a pitfall for a number of progressive bands who put being distinctive above being understandable, and anyone looking for a heavy, industrial sound that is more geared towards listener accessibility while covering similar subjects would do well to check out Machinery\u2019s \u201cThe Passing\u201d, which is much more focused and, sadly, not nearly as well known.\n",
        "\nIf ever there was an unlikely metal band to receive both widespread acclaim and recognition from the public media, it is Sweden's Meshuggah. Although they are rightfully hailed as one of the most talented acts in metal today, their trademark sound of heavy rhythmic experimentation and abrasiveness certainly isn't an easy drink to swallow, but the band still gains new legions of fans with every new record they churn out. 2008's 'ObZen' is played by a band that already enjoys quite a few years of experience, but it is my first legitimate album experience with Meshuggah nonetheless. Although by all means a thrash metal record, there is much more going on here, and although I have been reluctant to look into this band for a while, I have always shared the notion that they are indeed one of the most skilled acts out there. 'ObZen' only reaffirms this belief, and each song is made to be a clear statement that Meshuggah show no intent in stopping their metal barrage. Despite all of the brilliance employed on the album though, there is the impression that the music may have been more enjoyable, had Meshuggah pulled out more than one fancy trick to work with.\n\n'ObZen' features a general return to jazzier modes, although the music Meshuggah makes on 'Obzen' certainly will not be seen as jazz to the vast majority of listeners. Instead, the first impression is that of highly rhythmically unconventional thrash metal, complete with some incredibly aggressive shouting vocals, courtesy of Jens Kidman. Despite the very angry and in-your-face attitude the music presents however, the album is backed up by a surprisingly vivid exploration in philosophy. The album name itself turns out to be a portmanteau of the words 'obscene' and 'zen', and the album reflects on how the human race has found a state of harmony through constant violence. Heavy material to be sure, and the music reflects this through each palm muted riff.\n\nMeshuggah also pass me as being one of those bands that would require each band member to also be an expert in mathematics, as well as an absolute machine on the drums. Kidman's vocals take some time to warm up to, but- like quite a few progressive metal bands- the vocals are the weakest link in the sound. Every instrumentalist is an absolute genius at playing intensely complex rhythms, while keeping in check with the separate rhythms each other member is playing. The catch here is that this is really the only flashy trick Meshuggah pulls out for the entire record. As mind-numbing and incredible as it is, there is the feeling by the end of 'ObZen' that one has just listened to the same two or three riffs played over and over again, albeit in different time signatures. For a band who obviously borders genius, this does feel like something of an obvious mishap for the band, but for their somewhat narrow sound here, they do an absolutely incredible job of it.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah have been a band whose work has been hailed as being 'ingenious' in nature, and their influence on modern metal is without question. Moreover, the band's sheer talent and skill is legendary, managing to take technical metal to heights where one must be as good a mathematician as they are a musician to match it. However, regardless of Meshuggah's great reputation, one question remains; do they make good music? As far as their third full-length 'Chaosphere' is concerned, the answer remains ambiguous to me. Barring the great amount of acclaim and love others have for them, 'Chaosphere' remains a distinctly unpleasant album to listen to, and not necessarily because I am opposed to extreme or experimental forms of music. Rather, Meshuggah proves to us here once again that they can play circles around most other bands, but their singular approach to making music wears thin after only a few tracks. Although Meshuggah perspires brilliance on the drawing board, the final product emerges rather lukewarm.\n\nDowntuned guitars chug along through endless repetition, layered down with some brilliantly technical and precise drumming. Instrumentally, Meshuggah is more or less a one trick pony with 'Chaosphere', with the exception here and there of some atmospheric guitar textures. Besides that, Meshuggah forces a sonic assault upon the listener, than lends itself to no stop or sense of dynamic. Throughout an entire song, the riffs are not built around melodies, but rather around rhythms. In fact, in the music of 'Chaosphere', it comes as a bit of a minor shock to the listener when a note changes. Suffice to say, Meshuggah focus themselves almost solely around rhythm, and even use the guitars as a means to this end.\n\nThe vocals of Jens Kidman also add to the incredibly abrasive texture of this album. Although the lyrics are fairly philosophical and intelligent considering the aggressive nature of the music, the way he shouts through each track rarely feels as if it contributes much to the music, ultimately becoming about as monotonous as the rest of the sound. Through all of this tedium though, Meshuggah's strong points still manage to make it something of a worthwhile listen; although the album generally sounds the same throughout, there are a wide variety of different and unique time signatures being used that would be virtually impossible to fit into some sort of cohesive music in many other cases. Also, the band are very good at creating grooves, some of which becoming fairly memorable to the ear, although this can likely be attributed to the sheer repetition.\n\nUnfortunately, 'Chaosphere' is one of those cases for me where the acclaim and my expectations have been not met, and not by a long shot at that. Certainly not a pleasing or even much of an interesting listen here for me with 'Chaosphere', but the band's talent, uncompromising attitude, and raw aggression do come through intact.\n",
        "\nLook, this is a problem. Can those people play? Yes. Is the production of a high level? Sure. Is this album enjoyable? Fuck no. This is the first album of Meshuggah I hear, and hopefully the last. What the hell are those guys smoking? It is not because you can do something that you should. Randomly copy-pasting powerchords and putting a drum pattern under it, yeah I can do this shit too. Even with words, look:\n\n\u201cMeshuggah sucksuggah suMeshcksuuggah suM\u201d\n\nSee? This is art. This is progressive art. NO this is progressive technical art! All joking aside, I have great respect for the musicians that play this music, it\u2019s truly difficult and technical. It\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s worthless\u2026 Technicality and difficulty for the sake of it is very wrong. Look, Outworld is technical, progressive and whatnot. But there\u2019s a bigger plan behind every song and each has individuality and identity. That\u2019s a concept the guys from Meshuggah have never heard about I\u2019m afraid. Why so many people carry them on their hands is a mystery to me. Is it elitism? Snobbism? Or are all of those people drummers? I can see why drummers could enjoy this.\n\nThe album sounds like some kind of machine falling down the stairs. Repeatedly. As a result, all songs kind of blend into one long boring random song. I\u2019m sure they could fix a lot of things with a better singer, now it sounds like every vocal line is interchangeable within the album. That's the case for most of the guitar parts as well actually, it\u2019s like Lego metal. Wait, Lego comes from Denmark right? I guess it\u2019s a Scandinavian thing.\n\nNow look, if you like aimless math-metal already, or you don\u2019t care about melody or structure, or you have the urge to be \u201cdifferent\u201d, or you are a drummer: you probably will enjoy this album. I didn\u2019t. So I gave mine to a drummer I know. He was happy.\n",
        "\nI suppose this is the little brother predecessor to 'Catch Thirtythree', but ironically it works a whole lot better than that more recognized album. Both are essentially the same thing: Meshuggah attempts to create a single album-long (or EP-long in this case) track through slow development of themes and a rather ambient sense of construction. Honestly, the only difference might be length: listening to Meshuggah cave your head in with chugging riffs does definitely work better when it's in a package somewhat more bite-sized rather than the daunting, nearly fifty-minute length of 'Catch Thirtythree'. I'm inclined to say the songwriting is better too though; where 'Catch Thirtythree' felt rather choppy and inconsistent from movement to movement, 'I' works in a much more organic fashion. It's just a better piece overall.\n\nJust from looking at the length of this track, you can probably guess that development of the song is a slow process, and it definitely is. Beginning with over a minute and a half of repetitive chugging and double bass before the track begins in earnest, you can tell pretty quickly that you're in for a rather absorbed, patient listen. Surprisingly enough, the first half or so of 'I' has some of the most straightforward, 'Contradictions Collapse'-style material that Meshuggah had done in years at this point. Traditional thrash rhythms about the first half of the disc, culminating in what's practically a breakdown halfway through. The delivery of the music tends to slow down over the course of the disc, from the speedy, brutal beginning to a punishing, doomy second half which is just as memorable as the first.\n\nI'd say the second half is where this really shines, though. Sounding rather directly similar to 'Catch Thirtythree' in its monochromatic, dreary delivery, the latter half of 'I' is one of the most oppressive pieces I've ever heard from Meshuggah. Violently crushing, muted chords over the steady, chiming rhythms of Haake come together to create something surprisingly bleak and unsettling, even by Meshuggah's established standards. The progression of the disc is actually pretty involving even with its anti-climax of sorts: all the noise and chaos slips away into something much more ordered, mechanical, and punishing later on, and in this regard it works much better than had the band attempted to do the opposite.\n\nThis is actually one of Meshuggah's strongest overall works and a much better execution of the single-track release idea than 'Catch Thirtythree'. If you can stomach the rather ambitious ordeal that listening to this work is, you'll definitely find something very impressive in what might appear to be aimlessness. Definitely recommending this to any fans of the band- don't let it slip away just because it's an EP. It's definitely worth your time.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah are a groundbreaking band for many reasons. Not only have they managed to refresh their ideas and their lyrical concepts from album to album, they have also introduced new elements to the burgeoning death metal scene of Sweden and on an international level as well. Exploring death metal, thrash metal, progressive metal, jazz fusion and avant-garde metal and melting them into a horrific sculpture of art over the last twenty years, they added a polyrhythmic aspect into their unique sound. All of this truly began in 1995 with their second full-length effort Destroy Erase Improve; an album that has shaken heavy metal forever and became the benchmark for everyone who claims to be as experimental as every other band.\n\nStarting with the legendary hymn \u201cFuture Breed Machine\u201d, you can immediately tell the ferocious aggression that this Swedish quintet possesses with Jens Kidman\u2019s frantic and possessed wails, Peter Nordin\u2019s subtle bass lines, Fredrik Thordendal and M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m\u2019s scattered sub-human riffs and Tomas Haake\u2019s impeccable and calculated percussion. This song immediately caught my attention with its speed, its precise and somewhat solid structure, and also its unpredictability, when near the second half of the song, a jazzed-up passage makes its way into the nervous system of the song. It blows away every preconception that you might have about this band, especially when Thordendal unleashes a discordant and almost computerized solo near the four minute mark, making this opener is one of the best in metal history, period.\n\n\u201cTransfixion\u201d, \u201cVanished\u201d and \u201cTerminal Illusions\u201d possess the same characteristics mentioned here. However, some songs tend to lean more on groove like \u201cBeneath\u201d with its calm introduction and its multi-dimensional, almost bouncy riffs, \u201cSuffer in Truth\u201d, with the thunderous percussions and the agonizing, low tempo that invades it and \u201cInside What\u2019s Within Behind\u201d as well, with its experimental aspect, vocal-wise and structure-wise. It uses a lot more variety than any other songs on this album. \u201cSoul Burn\u201d has that same effect, but explodes into a polyrhythmic fury after its first half. After all this, the band finds its equilibrium in \u201cAcrid Placidity\u201d, a short but impactful instrumental with its echoic riffs and its artificial atmosphere. \n\nFinally, we have \u201cSublevels\u201d, the best track of this album in my view with its labyrinthine passages, its jazz fusion-influenced elements and its spoken-word performances. The riffs are furious, yet crystallized moment by moment. The percussions are intricate and very mechanical. At the end, everything fades out into a void of confusion and suspense.\n\nOverall, Meshuggah have opened the doorway for experimental metal by introducing beyond-philosophical meanings and paradoxes into their lyrical content, polyrythmic and acrobatic textures into their sound with Destroy Erase Improve, making it an immediate classic and an unmatched effort, even today. It is the paradigm shift of the 20th century that redefined metal music and introduced a whole new signification to it. \n\nNote : 90/100\n\nStandout tracks : Future Breed Machine, Soul Burn, Transfixion, Terminal Illusions, Suffer in Truth and Sublevels\n",
        "\nFollowing untold amounts of anticipation from their rabid fanbase, masters of mindbending metal Meshuggah finally released their live album \u2013 simply titled Alive \u2013 earlier this year which is also their first DVD in a 23-year career (that\u2019s right, the band has been in formation since the year I was born).\n\nMeshuggah retains an unusual status as an uncompromisingly original and innovative band which has pretty much forged a new form of extreme metal single-handedly; mechanical rather than organic, abstract rather than earthly, intellectual rather than emotional. It also renders them difficult to penetrate other than to the seasoned underground metal fan; a dense onslaught of inhuman intensity inaccessible to the casual listener. Their ferociously heavy songs characterised by 7- and 8-string guitars, Tomas Haake\u2019s stellar precise polyrhythmic drumming, and Fredrik Thordendal\u2019s distinct and cacophonous jazz-fusion inflected soloing, have brought them widespread critical acclaim and a small but dedicated fanbase, aswell as a perplexing number of copycats.\n\nAlive consists of a balanced variety of songs from the band\u2019s back catalogue recorded at number of concerts taking place in Tokyo, Toronto, Montreal and New York. In between songs are snippets of interviews and backstage footage, which while brief, give insight into the lives and workings of this enigmatic and highly influential band. These pieces of footage also serve as segues between colossal and often relentless pieces of music. Happily, this is a CD/DVD release which means you can enjoy the sonic triumph without interruption \u2013 although the recorded video is certainly impressively shot and edited.\n\nIn the interloping footage, the band gives the distinct impression of being an astute and down-to-earth group of dedicated individuals who have not passed up the opportunity to gain some perspective and insight from their experiences. My one complaint is because of the brevity of these segments, there isn\u2019t much scope for detailed interviews or lengthy footage.\n\nOne thing that stands out besides the band\u2019s stunning performances is the sound quality throughout, which is all the more impressive considering the bowel-rupturing heaviness and specialised nature of their sound. In fact, many songs sound even better than on the albums themselves. Drummer Tomas Haake in particular shines in all performances, his technicality and dizzying proficiency eclipsing almost any human attempt at percussion. \n\nOn Pravus \u2013 one of the better songs on their last album, obZen - the band gives an outstanding performance in which the thunderous riffs and otherworldy, almost psychedelic leads are delivered with unparalleled sound quality.\nFans will be moist with delight at the performance of Bleed \u2013 a song which has gained the band some fame due to its relentless pace and inhuman technicality. This is also delivered with remarkable precision and surprising clarity.\nThe songs from Chaosphere in particular sound great, and songs like New Millennium Cyanide Christ and The Mouth Licking What You\u2019ve Bled definitely have more impact and presence than on the album, accompanied by kinetic grooves and powerful, crushing bass.\nAnother outstanding performance is that of Lethargica \u2013 a gargantuan heavy groove interspersed with spacey leads which give way to an earth-crushing middle riff and a hypnotic end section.\n\nBesides the touring and interview footage, there are a few bonus features on the DVD \u2013 the music video for Bleed in all its existential terror, as well as the making thereof, and short features on the band\u2019s guitar/bass tech and Tomas Haake\u2019s monstrous customised drumkit. Maybe not the wealth of material the band could have included, but the main feature is such an achievement that one\u2019s appetite is sated without much need for surplus features.\n\nThis release is definitely a worthwhile addition to an already extensive gamut of outstanding material from this band, and a great purchase for any existing fan aswell as newcomers looking for an entry point into the sometimes terrifying world of Meshuggah.\n",
        "\nWhile I've been inundated with updates on Blabbermouth about Maynard Keenan releasing a DVD about his wine producing exploits, one of the other major players of cutting edge prog metal , Meshuggah, were putting together something that actually got me excited - a live DVD and CD, with footage taken from the bands first ever world tour supporting the sublime \"Obzen\" album.\n\nSome fans may be puzzled at the omission of any \"Destroy Erase Improve\" tracks, but its refreshing to see a band not rest on its laurels and try and move on from past glories (anyone else think Metallica have rinsed playing Seek and Destroy live?). Meshuggah on-stage apperance is fitting for the music that they play - Fred and M\u00e5rten with their unreal 8-string guitars, Jens with his skull positively pulsating as he torturously unleashes his vocals, and the entire band dressed in an uncompromising monochromic black.\n\nThe music is faultlessly tight - not a single beat is missed and those insane stacatto polyrhythms retain all their wierdness perfectly. Although to be honest, you cant help thinking whilst listening to it that you'd rather be hearing the better-sounding studio versions of the songs, since Meshuggah are not the band to jam and alter stuff majorly live (with the exception of Fred, who does some amazing improvs for solos).\n\nHighlights include the massive slab of lushness that is \"Rational Gaze\", Haakes extra-bewildering drumming on \"The Mouth Licking What You've Bled\", and Fred's solo on the outro to \"Straws Pulled at Random\", which still ranks as one of the most beautiful pieces of music that i've had the pleasure of hearing.If you're lacking in the funds you'd be better off buying the re-release of Nothing, since it has a bonus DVD with amazing footage from Download 2005 on it, and you get an unbelievable album included too obviously.\n",
        "\nThe amazing thing about Meshuggah\u2019s Nothing is that in many ways it is an album that does nothing.\n\nOn the surface this has all of the elements that gave Meshuggah their distinct sound. The bizarre time signatures are here as is the meaty guitar sound and Jens Kidman\u2019s unique gravelly bark. The production is excellent and contributes to a very clean sound that adds to the technical sounding nature of the album. And it\u2019s heavy. In fact it\u2019s a positively brutal sound that even many full fledged death metal bands fail to get without relying heavily on blast beats.\n\nThough they were always heavily influenced by their rhythm section there was always a semblance on writing some sort of song which went somewhere. If you listen to the seminal Destroy Erase Improve there is a demented thrash vibe that permeates the album coupled with more melancholy moments (e.g. Acrid Placidity). There are different tempos and each song sounds like a separate song, with its own vibe and intent. Not on Nothing.\n\nOn Nothing, Meshhugah strip away any vestige of song writing. As a result it creates the impression of one giant monotonous off kilter riff that goes on for nearly an hour. The songs, if they can be called that, merge into one another to form one giant amorphous mass. There is absolutely no variation on the album except for the pointless waffle at the end.\n\nContributing to the monotony is that the album seems toneless and is stuck in the same speed through out. There is no real variation in the songs, the tempo at which they\u2019re played, the riffs played or Kidman\u2019s vocals \n\nIn many ways it\u2019s like listening to a CD skipping on the same spot. It is undeniably heavy and it is technically sophisticated but it\u2019s a mindless heaviness and an equally mindless technicality. \n\nTo sum it up in five words, Nothing is mind numbingly boring.\n",
        "\nChaosphere epitomizes the core attributes of metal, it is deafeningly resonant, it is headlong and relentless in its sonic assault and it is tailor made for engendering psychic disintegration slowly leading to the depths of complete chaos and derangement. The music is not only intense but its just raw and highly dense, it definitely is not just an attempt at complexity but still is a near impossible feat to be emulated. This record has this complete lack of ambiance, there are no elements which can remotely be associated with musical coherence. Chaosphere has an unprecedented originality which complements its extreme density to such an extend that there is hardly any room for dissection and re engineering. In other words it is seemingly impossible to identify the DNA of Chaosphere. There is no single root to this sound, it is daunting to recognize the inspiration or the influences of such a crass din, there is no way someone can write a fitting review for a cacophony or a Chaosphere.\n\nStart playing this record, you can hear the omnipresent pounding of drums which is as good as someone ramming your skull on to a concrete rampart, the down tuned guitars riffs are monotonous and repeating throughout the song, not to mention that there is no tinge of refinement to this music, its just raw crude noise which interestingly sounds aggressive as heck. \"New Millennium Cyanide Christ\" is slightly more evolved sound compared to the rest of the record, this may be the reason why this is popular, the very next track \"Corridor of Chameleon\" is slightly more groovy and is like a prelude to their subsequent album \"Nothing\", in this song the trademark Thordendal's synthesizer sound was like a short lived respite from the otherwise ravaging music. The riffs in Neurotica is extremely reminiscent of early Metallica, interestingly for once I was able to catch a glimpse of one of the influences which drives this unique band.\n\nRepeated listens to Chaosphere gave me the feel that Meshuggah has actually fused all their influences in an absolutely elementary way. They are rebuilding the music in a bottom up fashion, in other words they combine the atoms and molecules of thrash, jazz, technical death, progressive & math metal to create a new soul to the sound. The blending is so deep rooted that you can expect only these rare momentary flashes of liberation where your intriguing mind get a glimpse to their actual musical influence. This explains the rawness in their sound and also since the influences are not combined in its evolved form they tend to be not so rhetoric and this results in a complex, dense and rustic feel. It is beyond my logic as to how they managed to make this album so addictive, usually my musical preferences are driven by the feel and ambiance of the music and not the factor of loudness so Chaosphere was definitely looking like an aberration in my play list.\n\nA record like this need not have any lyrics at all, Kidman can vomit gibberish and still create more than enough interest in the listener by the sheer musical brilliance. Actually the concept behind their music was the biggest compelling reason for me to explore the lyrics, interesting enough the same crudeness exhibited in the music reflects in their lyrics too, needless to say that they are far from being poetic. Songs mainly talk about different facets of human psyche, the themes range from duality of human nature to the ironic cold weariness of the life, opportunism, causticity and insanity. The lyrics are direct on the face and hardly seem to have any hidden agenda. In the world of Chaosphere, the lyrics are like a parallel universe which just runs out of sync with the music, there is hardly any prominence to lyrics when the compositions do not have any atmosphere to speak about. The very lack of ambiance makes Meshuggah very intriguing, it was very tough for me to explain how can a sound like this satiate the musical appetite of any human brain at all but repeated listens did give an answer to that.\n\nOne very interesting peculiarity of Chaosphere is the fact that it is impossible to comprehend the music within the first few listens, the very first listen is bound to rack your nerves and confuse the heck out to an extend where you will be clueless as to what had hit you. Even though Chaosphere introduces itself as a hard hitting aggressive record, it slowly reveals more during the repeated listens. The album slowly opens up after a dozen or more listens and the intimidating density will slowly ease, the earlier crude feel is more and more replaced by a surrealistic touch which is amplified by the guitar synths. This strange congregation of polar influences will start showing some real elegance and flow only when you are able to train your ears to get through the exploding drums and listen to the guitar and the complementing vocals. This is exactly when you realize the inherent dual nature of Meshuggah's creation, it gives a strange feeling where you wouldn't know whether to go on a rage or just stand still and revere the genius of this creation.\n\nMeshuggah is definitely not for a casual listener, you need to give the music a real patient listen to be in concordance with a sound which is exploding in all possible directions. Now when I listen to Chaosphere I hear only a train of instruments exhibiting a million textures germinating a fervid whirlpool of thoughts which can find its place only in a surreal nightmare. The onslaught ends only when the record ends, after which you will be left with a strange lull which incidentally happened after the storm.\n",
        "\nSo I guess this is Meshuggah's hardcore album; it's really slowed down and even the technicality seems scaled back a little bit. This is easily Meshuggah's slowest release, with a pretty crawling pace being the standard most of the time and a seemingly more catchy delivery being present also. This actually has some of Meshuggah's heaviest and most memorable tracks in the band's career; 'Rational Gaze' might in fact be the band's best song.\n\nIt's not so much that this is particularly less technical, but the odd time signatures seem not quite as long, or at least the riffs and rhythms are infectious and rooted enough in hardcore that this is easier to follow than your typical Meshuggah album. There's not quite as many massive shifts, the lead guitarwork is a little more melodic (I take it back, the lead at the end of 'Straws Pulled At Random' makes it the best track ever), and in general this is an easier listen than, say, 'Chaosphere'. It's still punishingly technical and Meshuggah's typical sound is still intact; this next to 'Chaosphere' may be Meshuggah's most archetypal album, and while this, like the previous album, is fully disengaged from traditional metal conventions, it's still one of the less harrowing releases in Meshuggah's discography.\n\nWhat makes this album so fantastic is that it's so memorable; I mean, you've got 'Rational Gaze', 'Perpetual Black Second', 'Glints Collide'- really, if you take a look at the tracklisting, it's essentially a live Meshuggah set minus 'Future Breed Machine' and 'New Millennium Cyanide Christ'. The unusually heavy production (courtesy of the even lower than usual tuning) and overall excellent mixing (despite the very brief time the band had to produce this record) really breaths additional life into already savage songs, etching the album even more firmly into the listener's memory.\n\nIn the end, Meshuggah is Meshuggah, but those who aren't as big a fan of some of the band's more heady works might find this a good place to start. I can actually hum a few riffs from this release, which is something I can't really say for any of the others, so take from that what you will.\n",
        "\nThis is one of the lesser-known entries in Meshuggah's discography, and though it's entirely unnecessary, it's a nice little item for friends of the band. The super jewel box edition of 'Chaosphere' has the same tracks as are found on this, so if you have that, there's no real reason to pick this up, but for those without it, this is a nice little release to add to your Meshuggah collection.\n\nOkay, so we've got a demo version of 'Sane', which unsurprisingly sounds just like it would on 'Chaosphere', and a live version of 'Future Breed Machine', which unsurprisingly sounds just like it does on 'Destroy Erase Improve' but with worse mixing. Things get more interesting from there on out; the 'Mayhem version' of that same track is about as devastatingly heavy as other reviewers imply. This slowed-down version of 'Future Breed Machine' is laced with added electronic effects, and while I think this is just a slowed-down remix, not an actual re-recording, it's still a pretty phenomenal track and rivals the original, albeit in a very different way.\n\nThe last three are just fun little extras; the acoustic version of, yet again, 'Future Breed Machine' is a cute novelty. The concluding two electronic tracks, though, are more substantial; they're entirely unmetal, but they're surprisingly well composed and deep little dance numbers that can withstand multiple listens without seeming shallow or irritating. It's surely not what most people are looking for on a Meshuggah release, but hell, I like them.\n\nOnly one of the tracks here really NEEDS to be heard (the 'Mayhem version' of course), so if you just want to hear the most essential item, download that off your favorite file-sharing service. If you like the idea of Meshuggah gone techno or are just an ardent completist, you might as well grab this; it's pretty cheap in any major online storefronts and will give you a hell of a lot more enjoyment for your money than whatever Pelican crapped out last.\n",
        "\nWhile Alive is not the first DVD that Meshuggah has released, having put out a small compilation DVD of the same consistancy for the 2006 reissue of the band's album Nothing, this is the first release to be packaged and prepared solely as a DVD specific release. While this DVD features live footage, it is set up almost like a documentary, having footage from various clips from the band's tour to support their ObZen release, littered with clips between the songs that give some insight into the band, their touring mentallity, and things that go on behind the scenes. Luckily, this DVD puts a more serious look at the band and is not just footage littered with Jackass brand hysterics and clips of band members on the toilet.\n\nThe main issue behind having a DVD that has clips from various concerts is that the consistence is not quite the same as just one solid show from start to finish. However, there is a perk to having it set up like this, which is that you can get a feel for how everything is within the band as the DVD goes along thanks to the little commentary sections that the band members give between tracks. Of course, both of these ring true on this DVD. There are some inconsistencies on the DVD thanks to this, but mostly noticable through the vocals. If you listen to the first clip, \"Perpetual Black Second\", it is clear that the vocals are not properly warmed up, and then on the next video, \"Pravus\", they clearly are. If you ever pulled vocal duties, this will sometimes happen and is often expected on DVD releases, but it seems like there are other tracks here and there where either the vocalist seems to not be properly warmed up, or out of breath, and then the next video he's fine. This causes some issues as to the live experience of the program and makes you wonder if he, or the band as a whole, could pull the song off live or not when they can pull the next song off without a problem. Also, some of the clips, though often insightful into the daily workings of the band, can sometimes just be there, such as \"Dissemenation\" and \"Ritual\", the latter being footage of the band talking in their native tongue, then of the venue from the outside.\n\nEach performance on this DVD, as well as the additional clips between, are clearly shot with High Definition cameras, as the quality of the footage itself is amazing and very professional. The audio is great too, being very clear with all the sound levels being just right that every instrument, including the vocalist, can be heard clearly. Aside the audio and video, the final product has some nice little touches such as a very nice black and white filter used on the smaller segments, as well as the usage of two different screens that sometimes appear during the live performances. While this isn't the moment during the guitar solo on \"Lethargica\".\n\nSo, on the DVD you get you have a semi-documentary with live footage, as well as a few other features. You get a guitar and drum tour, which just shows the instruments off, as well as the music video to \"Bleed\" and the making of it. Nothing special unless you have never seen the music video, which will blow your mind. The \"Making Of Bleed\" mini-documentary is actually very interesting to see though, as it shows a little bit more about the goings on behind the video then you would expect there to be, but won't serve much more then one play.\n\nThere are a few issues that really bog this DVD down though. The fact that you cannot set it up to play only the live videos would have been a huge plus, regardless of the pushing of one button to skip to the next video. That, and the fact that the videos are not in order. One minute you're in Tokyo, the next New York, U.S.A., and then in Canada and back to Tokyo, then all over Canada. Things would have worked out better if the videos were clumped by the location as well, not so much to correspond to some of the backstage footage since none of it really goes into detail about the location, but for the sake of continuity. Sure you could argue they may be different dates but they are not according to the booklet, which is even more of a kicker.\n\nBut the bigger problem on this release is the simple fact that the DVD doesn't really come to a real climax. \"Straws Pulled At Random\" concludes the live videos on the DVD, and starts with the band thanking the fans for being there and the bands on the tour with them, but never really says anything about them being done. They just play the song and when it finishes it cuts to the next little clip, \"End\", which goes into the credits. Given how everything is set up, you'd think the music that starts for the credits meant that there was more to come, but there's not, and it's a big let down.\n\nAlong with the DVD, you get an audio CD of the live songs which is great because it lumps the venues together and the songs flow from one another as per the actual set list played. The audio is taken directly from the DVD itself too. This is a huge plus towards this release because this release comes in a readily available package and won't cost you an arm and a leg. This CD is also available as a seperate purchase item, but only through on-line retailers, and will average to just a little more for the DVD/CD combo then the CD in MP3 format.\n\nSo, even though Alive is a decent release, it has some complications that defy common sense, and is far from a definitive DVD release. If you are a fan of the band in any way, it is still worth checking out as there are some really insightful things spoken of during the breaks between the live videos, as well as some moments that may cause you to gain a little more respect for the band then what you have before.. Aside that you have some spectacular live footage that is very professional and gives an accurate representation of a Meshuggah concert. However, this is not a release that you should walk into expecting great things from, but is more of a casual ObZen companion piece for your collection. \n\nOriginally posted on Apoch's Metal Review\nwww.apochs.net\n",
        "\nMusically, artistically, and metallically this is indeed nothing, as the title suggests, but from a broader perspective, it is something \u2013 to much dismay. This is seriously one of the worst creations of the human race. Fortunately it's not metal, so metal cannot be held responsible for having produced this utter nadir of a\u2026 well, thing.\n\nThere is only one real idea in this album, and that's the usage of chugging riffs with strange rhythmic values. There is an astounding lack of melody. Everything from Nunslaughter to Brodequin is melodic. This is not. Strictly speaking, yes, there are melodies in the riffs, in that they contain notes of at least two different pitches. However, the emphasis is always entirely on the rhythm (with the exception of the last riff in 'Straws Pulled at Random') and combined with the down-tuned mechanical guitars, the riffs sound like steel fragments bouncing and colliding with each other at random, not music. This is really about as metal as Korn at most. \n\nRhythmically, there are lots of stop-starts, strange time signatures, and polyrhythmic drumming, but they bring no interesting, let alone good, results. There is no real variation; sure, each phrase sounds quite random, disjointed, and chaotic, but they are straightforwardly repeated in the exact same way multiple times. There aren't even drum fills. It is absolutely predictable and repetitive \u2013 the rhythms do nothing save the music from the incredible monotony of the melodic department.\n\nThe rest of the music hardly does anything for the most part, leaving everything to the strange rhythmic exercise. Vocals bark monotonously, without any melody or variation in tone, adding nothing to the music but an extra layer of annoyance. Guitar solos aren't technical scale exercises, but even worse: scale exercises would have at least given some real melody, but the here, despite the extremely fluid solo tone, which is a nice contrast to the excessive sterility of everything else on the album but still quite annoying in itself, there are many stop-starts, making the music more mechanical, and often they just sound like background noise, which isn't as bad as the riffs but still don't compensate for them. Now, there are exceptions: 'Closed Eye Visuals' and 'Straws Pulled at Random' actually contain melodic solos, and while they lack any direction and are frequently disturbed by the riffs, by the very fact that they are melodic, they constitute the highlight of the album. \n\nGenerally songs go through a cycle of riffs and verses twice, and then proceed to a different section, which usually includes a guitar solo. However, the presence of a certain pattern does not equate to structure. Each riff is interchangeable with another, and each song has little to no difference from another. If you've heard one riff, then you've heard the entire album. There is no sense of progression, climax, or variation; it's simply riff after riff, and leaves almost no breathing space to at least take a rest before being bombarded with the noise. Some exceptions include the clean guitar sections of 'Closed Eye Visuals' and the aforetime mentioned riff with some melody which appears in 'Straws Pulled at Random.' 'Spasm' is also one of the most tolerable songs because there is a lead melody in the background, which is played throughout the song. However, not all exceptions are positive ones; the closer 'Obsidian' is on a whole new level of monotony by itself. After a tolerable ambient intro, it plays a single riff for more than five minutes (on the re-recorded version). It doesn't even have any vocals, and there is one drum hit per phrase. It is obviously boring, annoying, repulsive, etc. but these several objective facts about the song will suffice.\n\nThis is barely even music, let alone metal, and it is literally an audial torture that makes free jazz and twelve-tone classical sound like easy listening music. Hell, listening to John Cage's '4:33' is likely to yield a much more musical experience than listening to 'Nothing,' and any garbage from melodeath to pop punk actually becomes enjoyable for a while after listening to this. Titling this album 'Nothing' is an insult to nothingness.\n",
        "\nContradictions Collapse was a thrash metal album that was interesting for thrash metal, but not even close to interesting compared to what they were to become in later years. Destroy Erase Improve was completely different than Contradictions Collapse, while still keeping much of the thrash elements. They added a lot more interesting polyrhythms, which they would later become famous for, and even jazz fusion elements. It was clear right away that Meshuggah was not going to become the next Slayer in that they were certainly not going to rerelease the same album throughout their entire career. In fact, they have become the exact opposite.\n\nEnter Chaosphere. Where to begin...unbelievable technical skill, the lyrics are more mature, much more consistency within the songs and throughout the album as a whole, and most of all: this album is infinitely more intense than their previous two releases. Their now famous \"New Millenium Cyanide Christ\" is to date alongside \"Bleed\" as one of their most intense, heavy, and blood pumping songs they have released. Every time I listen to it I feel like my brain is literally being raped by the porn star Evan Stone, especially when the horrifyingly unique solo kicks in. All I have to say about lyrical content is this: \"Corridor Of Chameleons.\" Read those lyrics while listening to that song and be amazed by the amazing poet, Tomas Haake. Also, don't forget to pay attention to the impossible time signature mind fucks present in that and every other song on this album.\n\nThe album doesn't get worse from there...the mechanical \"The Exquisite Machinery Of Torture\" is one of the creepiest and uneasy songs I have heard. You can actually feel Kidman's fury when he screams the chorus to \"Sane.\" Speaking of sanity, you will find absolutely none of that in the closing track \"Elastic.\" Meshuggah has released some pretty crazy tracks in their career, but \"Elastic\" actually makes you feel like your losing your grasp on reality.\n\nMeshuggah, Devin Townsend and Mastodon are probably the most unpredictable bands in metal. Who the fuck would have expected to get Chaosphere after Destroy Erase Improve. Better yet, who the fuck would have expected to get Nothing with it's groovy, slow dark feel after their most intense, fast paced release yet? Or the 47 minute epic Catch Thirtythree? Meshuggah never fails to keep my interest and seems to get better with every release. Even so, Chaosphere still somehow seems near perfect. If you have been living under a rock since 1998, lift that rock over your fucking head right now and experience Chaosphere.\n",
        "\nI know I am new to this website, but I don't give out 100%'s that freely at all. In fact, just so my 100% won't seem like absolute bullshit, let's just get this out of the way right off the bat. The only other albums I would rate 100% out of all of the albums in the world would be Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd, In The Court Of The Crimson King by King Crimson, Images and Words by Dream Theater, Still Life by Opeth and maybe Master Of Puppets by Metallica. That is it. So this is literally one of my all time favorite albums. Why, you ask?\n\nIn order for an album to be considered spectacular, in my mind, it must contain three things, and three things only. Some sort of technical ability/talent in the individual instruments, thought provoking lyrics, and most importantly atmosphere. Atmosphere is the most essential part to music in my opinion because it plays with the emotions of the listener. Isn't that why we listen to music to begin with?\n\nNow: onto Catch Thirtythree. Where to begin...it is difficult to pinpoint anything really because everything in my opinion is flawless. From the complex polyrhythms and mind-numbing time signature changes to Kidman's appropriately inhuman vocals, everything perfectly sets the bleak tone for the monster that is Catch Thirtythree. Surprisingly, nothing exemplifies the horrifying feel to the album as perfectly as Meshuggah's new technique that they experimented with on this album: silence. Their use of silence in \"In Death is Death\" and \"Mind's Mirrors\" I find to be much more intense than most other Meshuggah songs combined. When a band can create such intrigue and intensity through use of silence, you know that there is something special to behold.\n\nNow, there has been a lot of complaints about the absence of Tomas Haake and his replacement by the \"Drumkit From Hell.\" Tomas Haake is my favorite lyricist in metal, and other than Mike Portnoy my favorite drummer as well. But as strange as this sounds, \"Drumkit From Hell\" serves its purpose flawlessly, and it is actually made up of samples from Haake's drumming. I barely even notice it anymore. There has also been some complaints about the extreme repetition in their music. I wonder if those reviewers listened to this album how it was meant to be listened to: from track 1 to track 13 straight through and ONLY track 1 to track 13 straight through. Meshuggah has even stated that it was supposed to be an experimental piece. Not unlike A Pleasant Shade of Grey by Fates Warning or Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence by Dream Theater, yes they are considered full albums, but they are designed as one individual song. This means that not only will you not get the full effect i! f you only listen to one track, but you will only get a random 1/13 of the effect. It would be like fast forwarding into a five minute song, listening to twenty seconds of a middle section then turning it off. As for their repetitious habits in general, if you listen to the music carefully it actually is not repetitious at all. In fact, it only appears to be repetitious but is constantly changing and progressing. That is part of the genius behind them, and part of the reason why this is my favorite CD of all time: with each listen I find something new. I've also heard people refer to this as Meshuggah's weakest album. Now this may not be as thrashy and fun as Contradictions Collapse or Destroy Erase Improve, but it is a hell of a lot more consistent, emotional, and mature in every possible way.\n\nAll in all, this is one of my favorite albums of all time and I will probably continue to listen to this album for the rest of my entire life. Now it is difficult to pinpoint highlights in Catch Thirtythree because it is, as I have stated endlessly, an individual song. If I had to choose a few memorable moments, I would say the terror inducing solo in Entrapment, all of In Death-Is Death, and Dehumanization. My suggestion would be to buy this album immediately, put it in your stereo, maybe a good novel as well, sit next to your fire place and hold onto your hats for the least relaxing, but hopefully most rewarding 47 minutes of your life. Be sure NOT to leave your seat until the 47 minutes is up!\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s face it; Meshuggah isn\u2019t the most creative band out there. Better yet, Meshuggah isn\u2019t even a good band. Now what we got here is a 21 minute song titled \u201cI\u201d. Yet in the entire 21 minute running time of this song, they don\u2019t do anything that sounds different than any of their other work. This is nothing but 21 minutes of bland power chording, mindless drumming, monotonous vocals, and a complete lack of structure.\n\nOne of the three annoying aspects to this overlong song would have to be that the guitarist is doing nothing more than simple power chords. Let me state it right now, there are absolutely no riffs in this song, also if you like melodies in your music look elsewhere, because they\u2019re not in here either. The guitarist plays the same low tuned chord over and over and over, and after you hear this for the first five minutes or so you\u2019ll realize that this will be going on for about another 15 minutes, and you\u2019ll want to listen to something else of how bored you get. \n\nThe second most annoying part would hands down be the drumming. It\u2019s nothing but an overload of awful snare rape and fast beats. Sometime in the song, about six minutes or so in if I\u2019m correct, the snare is the only drum hit for about two-four minutes while its being hit off tempo compared to the guitar. Sometimes it\u2019s being hit faster than the guitar is playing, and sometimes it\u2019s played much slower. But the fact is that he does nothing but snare for a few minutes. Who taught this guy how to play drums anyways, Lars Ulrich? On top of the annoying drummer doing maybe three things for the entire song, the drums don\u2019t sound real, they sound like some generic computerized drum program. Having to listen to bland drum beats that sound like their fake for 21 minutes while having the same chord being played over them make this song old and very boring fast.\n\nJens Kidman is the third most annoying feature to this song (or the band). If you have never heard him sing, them you\u2019re lucky you haven\u2019t. If you have ever heard him sing you know what I\u2019m getting at. For those of you who haven\u2019t before let me explain, he is one of those monotone screamer types where everything that comes out of his mouth in no matter what pitch is the exact same over the harsh screams that will disrupt you whenever you hear them. \n\nWhat really pisses me off about the whole EP is that in the entire 21 minute running time they don\u2019t bother to try and do anything new or innovative to their music, they just stick with the same sound they have been using for over the past ten years or so. They don\u2019t do anything creative, they don\u2019t do anything innovative, and they haven\u2019t changed their sound much since their first album came out. This song is so repetitive, and so tedious that it\u2019s pathetic. It\u2019s like all they did was copy and paste previous ideas of theirs into one overlong song. I\u2019m really tired after listening to this, and I sure could use a nap.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah was always an anomaly in metal. They play a style similar to thrash, but in countless seemingly random time signatures. At first they were fairly standard thrash, but their own unique sound soon began to develop and continued to do so. On Destroy.Erase.Improve. they began their mathematics influenced style and furthered their sound on Chaossphere. This is the pinnacle of their sound when it comes to mathematic brutality. There is nothing organic here. \n\nNothing is by far the grooviest album that Meshuggah has ever recorded, as well as one of the strangest. The music rarely accelerates beyond mid temp and is at times even slower than that. The riffs are a mixture of oddly timed power chords and off kilter bends. The album sounds like nothing that you\u2019ve ever heard before. It is calculating and unmerciful in a way that no prior album has even attempted to be. The rhythms are truly twisted. The music is anything but predictable and at times it seems as if the time signatures and beats were devised at random and played by machines. The album is chaotic in an organized and regimented fashion. It sounds as if it could fall at any second, but from the first note you know that it never will. \n\nThis is the first album that Meshuggah began to use their (now famous) eight stringed guitars. As such the album is far heavier than any of their earlier works, and their earlier works are a far cry from soft. The riffs are mostly comprised of either power chords or single notes on the lower of the two strings, sometimes relying on a combination of the two. Colossal bends frequently appear to further distort the landscape. Thorendal\u2019s solos are masterful displays of tapping and the like. They are far from pointless wankery, instead they further enhance the odd, almost otherworldly, feel of the music. The bass generally follows the guitars, and overall seems to shine a bit less than on some of Meshuggah\u2019s previous works. All the same, it is right in the thick of things as it backs up the grooves and is an indispensable part of the sound. \n\nThe drumming is incredible and unique. It is more subdued than on albums like Chaossphere or Destroy.Erase.Improve. but it is no less impressive. The drums are frequently operating in more than one time signature. Polyrhythmic beats are also fairly prevalent on this album. While the drums are a constantly flowing enigma of contorted rhythms, the drums never relinquish their most basic role: the keeping of time (a skill that several tech death drummers have yet to master). The snare drum will frequently act as a near metronome and keep a four/four undercurrent to the otherwise odd time signatures. As a final note, while the drumming has countless interesting beats, there are no fills. This serves to enhance the robotic aspect of the music. Haake truly could pass off as a drum machine if he wanted to. In fact, he pulled off a better inhuman and robotic performance here than the drum machine did on Catch Thirty Three.\n\nThe vocals are yet another perplexing aspect of Meshuggah\u2019s sound. They consist of hardcore esque shouts, yet they sound more robotic than any distorted effects could ever yield and less human than the most guttural of singers. They have absolutely no emotion, and in this case, that turns out to be one of their greatest assets. (On Spasm Haake takes over the vocal duties and through the use of several odd effects continues the tirade of bizarre and robotic assaults.) The singing is spot on at all times. It doesn\u2019t always follow the guitars (I\u2019m not even sure if it would be humanly possible to do so\u2026) but frequently provides yet another heavy as hell backbone for the music to rest on. \n\nThe lyrics are breathtaking. They are philosophical and abstract lyrics, yet they manage to fit perfectly into the music. One of the major themes seems to be paradoxes, as exhibited by the second track (Rational Gaze): \u2018Squint your eyes to see clearly/Blur reality to make it real/let focus go from your deceiving eyes to know what\u2019s been concealed/we\u2019ve all been blinded \u2013 subjects to visual misinformation/a systematic denial of the crystalline.\u2019 They fit the paradoxical nature of the music itself perfectly and add another strike against everything that standard music is comprised of. While many bands go completely overboard in the field of thoughtful lyrics Meshuggah certainly do not and craft some of the greatest lyrics that I\u2019ve ever heard. \n\nThis is the first Meshuggah album to feature the quirky ambient bits that were so prevalent on Catch ThirtyThree. They aren\u2019t as forward, or as common, as they were on that album, but they\u2019re undoubtedly there. \n\nThe production on Nothing is very odd. It is completely sterile. Save the sound of the perfectly captured instruments there are NO other sounds. This could truly have been recorded in a vacuum. In addition, the guitar tones are truly unique. They\u2019re incredible low due to the use of eight strings, yet there is almost no fuzz on their distortion which makes them have a sound that I\u2019ve yet to hear anything like. \n\nNothing truly sounds robotic. I\u2019m not using that as an expression. I\u2019m saying that it truly sounds like machines made this. It is precise to a seemingly inhuman degree and there\u2019s nothing organic about it at all. Due to the inorganic nature of the riffs and the incredibly low nature of the guitars this is truly one of the heaviest albums I\u2019ve ever heard. It isn\u2019t brutal at all \u2013 don\u2019t expect something like Nile or Devourment \u2013 but is heavy in the way that a multi ton robotic tank is heavy. Unmercifully heavy. \n\nVariation is next to none existent on this disk. While it\u2019s like nothing that you\u2019ve ever heard before, the songs are all fairly similar. I\u2019m not saying this in a negative way, as it was undoubtedly intentional and greatly aids the music. From the beginning to the end every song is fairly similar (not to say that you won\u2019t have favorites, you undoubtedly will as several of them do have some unique characteristics). The monotony is yet another example of the robotic feel of the album. To truly experience it, you must listen to it straight through. At the same time, each individual track is strong enough to be listened to on its own. \n\nAfter all this praise it seems as if Nothing is a near perfect album that I\u2019d recommend to everyone. Well, I would recommend it to almost everyone, but not right away. It\u2019s an atrocious starting album for Meshuggah and if you haven\u2019t heard them I\u2019d recommend getting obZen first. This album also requires several listens to sink in. The first few times I heard it I was completely under-whelmed and it is only recently that its true majesty has been revealed to me. It certainly doesn\u2019t help that the first track, Stengah, is probably the most sterile and inaccessible songs on here. Still, this is undoubtedly a landmark album and anyone looking to hear something completely out of the ordinary is strongly recommended to give it a try.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah's Chaosphere stands as their most heavy, fast, and brutal album to date. It's literally like getting fucked (although I wouldn't know) in the ass brutally whilst getting punched in the face super hard by a drill instructor who's yelling at the top of his lungs at you the entire time. It never fails at being punishingly heavy, and if you need some serious rap-repellant, Chaosphere does the trick. It's boisterous, loud, crazy, loud, oddly-timed, loud, furious, and loud. Did I mention it's loud? Certainly this is what every housewife thinks of when they think of stereotypical metal.\n\nSurely such an album can't be bad, can it? Well, if you're in the mood for mindless thrashing, this isn't bad at all. Unfortunately, I find that nowadays I never listen to it all the way through. I wondered, because on the surface, this is the same as every post-none meshuggah album. Loud and heavy guitars, polyrhythmic drums, and drill sergeant vocals. What's not to like? Well, for one, once you get over the novelty of the heaviness, the approach wears thin and it gets quite boring. Sure, it's loud and heavy, and so was Nothing, but I remember every song on Nothing, and whenever I listen to Nothing, I feel the need to robot dance. In short, Nothing was catchy and had actual songs on it that piqued your interest. Or how about Destroy Erase Improve? It had jazzy undertones that greatly helped its atmosphere. In fact, every other Meshuggah album had discernable atmosphere. There is none to be found on Chaosphere.\n\nThis concept cannot be pinned down to any particular aspect of the music; it's intangible, but I can definitely feel the absence of atmosphere here. What it really is, is that there's no reason for Chaosphere's existence other than to be heavier and louder than the competition. That's the reason Chaosphere comes off as being so trite: there will always be someone louder and heavier. To achieve lasting value, there needs to be a musical statement being made. There needs to be a reason for its existence, and no such reason exists. There are riffs, but the riffs are blanks; they make a loud \"BANG!\" and attempt to fool you into thinking they are the real deal, but when they're over, there's none of the bullet-like effects, and the listener is unaffected by them. They're musical empty calories. \n\nChaosphere is not bad, by any means, in the sense that (at least in my opinion) funnyuns aren't bad. However, there's no musical value to Chaosphere, like there is no nutritional value to funnyuns. It's good to listen to when you need fast, heavy, loud, and brutal. But if you actually want to get something out of the music, look elsewhere in Meshuggah's catalogue, you will not get anything out of Chaosphere. \n\nOf course, the presence of filler doesn't help things. The one song everybody seems to like, New Millenium Cyanide Christ strikes me as the \"let's play power chords over and over again so we can be heavy\" attitude that makes mallcore so terrible. Neurosis has a similar quality, and also receives the skip button. And when you consider that a good 7 minutes of Elastic is just random noise, you can't help but wonder if Meshuggah were artificially inflating the running time. \n\nThere are good songs on here, but compared to other Meshuggah albums, the feeling is very transitory, and lacks any lasting value. Unlike other classic Meshuggah songs, you really can't remember anything on Chaosphere. For that reason, you will often find DEI, Contradictions Collapse, or Nothing (especially Nothing) in my CD player more often than Chaosphere. There's simply more to hang on to on those other CD's than there is on Chaosphere.\n",
        "\nAs you can tell the EP is only one song and it's a 21 minute song. This is just one of the types of experimentation Meshuggah has tried. They also made a one-song full-length album entitled Catch Thirty-Three where they divided it into several sections.\n\nThe EP begins with a one minute long showcase of the drumming of Thomas Haake who has been awarded best drummer awards for his drumming skills in Meshuggah. Then there's a long shriek followed by Jens Kidman and his vocals that make the band. They are very crazy and give you a feeling of pandemonium when listening to them. The song shows a lot more technical work and chaos then vocals which is not a bad thing at all since the instrumental side of it is what makes Meshuggah so popular. The lyrics are also great as well, as I find most of their lyrics tend to be. I cannot listen to this EP without opening up the lyrics and reading them along with the song. I've heard a lot of people who tend to not like Meshuggah due to the vocals and that's understandable as they take some tolerance and in this album there is no part where you can say he does better vocally as he does well throughout the entire EP. My only complaint with the song is that it has some elements that are quite boring and in fact you at times have the urge to just shut the song off and go listen to something less hectic but those times are few and far between. Unless you're a vocal junky and need to hear vocals, then you minus as well not bother with the EP at all.\n\nThis EP is one of my favorite EP's I have heard and even though there are times when you feel like it's just a bunch of random instrumentals, it shows the talent of all the musicians in the band and highlights each members strengths and weaknesses all in one song. Really, if I were to single out one member's performance on this it would be Thomas Haake's as the drumming is just insane and cannot just be recreated by anyone. Unlike other songs I've heard that are long, this EP has too much energy shown to not recognize each member of the band as supporting the sound. Definitely worth the purchase, especially for aspiring drummers and Meshuggah fans.\n",
        "\n\u2018ObZen\u2019 is in many ways, shapes and forms an absolutely fantastic product of the warped and twisted imaginations of the five-man mentalist brigade that is the mighty Meshuggah. Key amongst what makes \u2018ObZen\u2019 such a remarkable listen is that it not only has all the brute force and thoughtfully considered flair for variety and experimentation as we\u2019ve come to expect of Meshuggah, but it masterfully sidesteps the fathoms-deep pitfall that \u2018Catch 33\u2019 threw itself into with wanton abandon. \nWhile on said previous album Meshuggah took their distinctive approach to a preposterous limit, stretching the notion of cyclical, repetitive music so far that the strain was often (but not always) painfully visible, \u2018ObZen\u2019 sees them pull off quite a feat, with more abundant attention bestowed upon a wider variety of concepts and ideas, granting the material an accessibility they have only just fallen short of achieving before \u2013 while all the time never compromising on the intensity of the aggression they have previously displayed. \n\nThis sounds like a paradox in action; a band allowing their ideas to properly gestate and develop for the sake of accessibility but still retaining that slight sense of violent impenetrability which they have made their own. A paradox, indeed, but by Satan below it works.\n\n\u2018Combustion\u2019 is a sublime revelation to those who\u2019ve come to associate Meshuggah with spiralling, twisting rhythmic madness. The song rips the curtain up on \u2018ObZen\u2019 in a crashing whirlwind of thrash metal inspired riffery on the part of Marten Hagstrom and Fredrik Thordendal and pure, delightful kit-bashing from Tomas Haake. Showing with brazen confidence that they are just as capable of dynamic songcraft as they are of their trademark discordant madness, \u2018Combustion\u2019 is little short of a highlight of thrash metal in 2008 \u2013 by the time of that superbly atonal solo, the battering speed and almost epic vocal refrains have the listener impossibly exhilarated.\n\nThat is not to say that Meshuggah have strayed from their beaten track nor is said track becoming wearisome to tread. \u2018Bleed\u2019 is being elevated to the level of reverence usually bestowed upon \u2018New Millennium Cyanide Christ\u2019 and \u2018Future Breed Machine\u2019 for damn good reason, it\u2019s extraordinary beats and writhing, chugging chord progressions sounding something akin to sticking your head into the inner workings of a massive mechanical being, absolute in its deadly precision. \n\u2018This Spiteful Snake\u2019 and closer \u2018Dancers to a Discordant System\u2019 are more highlight tracks amongst many, blending grooving, deliciously palatable riffs with a fantastically clearly realised sense of imminent doom. These songs are just an example of the triumph of balance that Meshuggah have achieved here, and each and every song is in its own unique way extremely engaging.\n\nSimply as instrumentalists, the band themselves are just as fascinating. Hagstrom and Thordendal, along with bassist Dick Lovgren, maintain the record\u2019s relentless intensity and experimental flair with consummate skill, whilst Haake gives a lesson in musical duality by both anchoring the material and driving it forth with the twisted and contorted backbone of steel he provides. \nAfter \u2018Catch 33\u2019, it\u2019s a joy to hear him actually lay down some proper drum tracks in place of stringing pre-recorded samples together, with the man once again proving just what he can do with a pair of sticks in his hands. Vocalist Jens Kidman, however, offers one of the few downsides to \u2018ObZen\u2019, in that his admittedly powerful screams and well developed lyrical conceits are the only elements lacking in variety \u2013 he brings nothing new to the drawing board, and amidst some remarkable work he is comparatively unremarkable and worthy of little note.\n\n\u2018ObZen\u2019 is a landmark in the fluctuating career Meshuggah have been blazing through for over a decade now, a record that has taken everything that made them so very distinctive and upped the game by an extraordinary degree. As exceptional, enjoyable and flat-out extraordinary as their earlier masterwork \u2018Destroy Erase Improve\u2019, \u2018ObZen\u2019 is truly worthy of its surely inevitable inclusions on innumerable \u2018Albums of 2008\u2019 magazine lists, and you do yourself a profound disservice to let it slip below your radar.\n",
        "\nOn this EP Meshuggah are mostly mid-tempo, try out strange but not overtly technical grooves, remain pretty thrashy and are about to change their lyrical themes. Every song is very tight, though unusually composed in the sense that repetition is minimal. It's just a groovy riff after another, with changing dynamics and verses, assorted in an order that will seem pretty unfulfilling first. This takes time to get into.\n\nSlow progression through mechanized emotions is the core of this music. Countless of subtleties make the soundscape rich in its agonizing sterility. Meshuggah portray an impossible state of mind too nasty to touch with mere words.\n\nUnlike in their future works, they use acoustic guitar somewhat often in the songs and Kidman's shouts are much more melodic (especially on \"Ritual\", where he practically sings). Overall it's an interesting chapter of this band's history... An useful listen to this band's fans or people who care about dark concepts in music.\n",
        "\nI was not even aware of this album's release until the week it actually came out. The reason for this being that I haven't liked anything Meshuggah has done since Chaosphere, and had lost interest in them accordingly. I liked the aggressive pounding of the song Bleed, so decided to pick up the CD since it happened to be in stock where I work. Initially I thought, \"Eh, it's alright.\" But as I listened to the CD more.. well, wow.\n\nI started off by listening to Bleed a lot, eventually I discovered the song \"Dancers to a Discordant System\" which alone warrants this album a 60% in my book considering it's raw intensity and lyrical content. From there I really started to listen to the other songs, and while I don't love every song on the CD I have to say most of it is generally impressive. The best way I can describe the feeling you get from this album is this: Spiraling out of control as you fall closer and closer to a bottom you can't see.\n\nThe CD does a fairly good job of mixing up in-your-face riffs, to somewhat more groovy subtle riffs, and at times slows down a fair bit entirely. It definitely feels like a hybrid of much of their past work. Overall this is probably the best CD I've picked up in 2008 (although that's not saying much) and definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of any of Meshuggah's past work.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah used to be one of my favourite bands with Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere. I even liked Nothing to a certain extent but after that the band seemed to disappear up its own ass with I and Catch 33. Those two releases completely put me off the band and when I first got obZen I was primed to hate it.\n\nThat though was not the case. obZen starts with the catchy and groove heavy Combustion which brings to mind the glory days of Destroy Erase Improve and the bass heavy grooves on the song remind me a bit of Nothing. From here on the album basically feels like a mix of Destroy Erase Improve and Nothing while not really having the intensity of either of those albums. The songs have an incredibly clean production and this is without doubt the cleanest production the band has got yet. That though doesn\u2019t really work in favour of the music. Most of the songs sound sterilized and calculated to cause damage in the mosh pit.\n\nAlso, the last few years have seen countless bands imitating the Meshuggah sound and this has diluted the impact of the band. What was once completely unique is now common place and dull. Having said that, obZen does have a few good songs. Combustion as already mentioned is a great album opener and one that gave me hope for the album, while the title song starts like Fear Factory before coming good with some heavy staccato riffing. Dancers to a Discordant System is the lengthy album closer and it actually works pretty well. Apart from these three songs, the album just gets boring with everything here having been done before.\n\nobZen in fact feels like a very polished and calculated effort to go towards the next step of commercial accessibility. There are mosh parts for the kids, there are parts that some will call progressive and I\u2019m sure the guys who loved the last two releases will think this is a terrific evolution. I\u2019m not in that camp though and obZen just seems like a calculated re-hashing of past ideas and even more damning to the band it feels like what was once a leader in the scene has been reduced to copying its own imitators.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.kvltsite.com\n",
        "\nI can honestly say that 'ObZen' has the distinction of being the Meshuggah album that I was really hoping for immediately after 'Catch 33', an album that I wasn't quite able to enjoy as much as I'd like. 'ObZen', though, is a great combination of 'Destroy Erase Improve' and 'Nothing'-era(s) material with just a hint of the proggy elements of the last album, and the combination is absolutely great. It's blisteringly heavy and fairly metallic like the early stuff, has the grinding industrial feel of albums like 'Chaosphere', and manages to change things up with just enough prog to keep it interesting. Even if it was lacking that, though, it would still be an incredible album simply because this is one of the heaviest and most brutally aggressive albums that Meshuggah has made so far.\n\nThe first three tracks are the real killers on this one, and 'Bleed' is of course the centerpiece, reminding one of songs like 'New Millennium Cyanide Christ' which are so devoid of dynamics as to be almost totally binary songs. Just ramp up the speed and tightness of that earlier track and you have a good idea of what to expect with 'Bleed'; pure grinding brutality from start to finish (minus the clean guitar in the middle). The album opens up on a note quite different from the previous ones... a thrash beat! For the first time in probably a decade, Meshuggah strays from the bass drum versus guitar attack that's such a fixture of their music, like an announcement that they dug out the old albums and still like them. After 'Bleed', the sound of 'ObZen' strays a bit more towards 'Catch 33' territory, but it's sufficiently oldschool to not fall into the same traps that that album did.\n\nThe proggy tracks on 'ObZen' could be compared to 'Catch 33', but more accurately they sound like an extension of songs like 'Sublevels' off the earlier albums. They're less ruthlessly atonal and more delicate experiments in texturing and mysterious layers of atmosphere. The more I think about it, the more I think you could say that 'ObZen' is really a combination of all of Meshuggah's previous material into a singular sound. This would be a miserable failure for most bands, but in Meshuggah's case, they pull it off with style. The elements of savagery and progression mesh very well throughout the album without ever becoming stale. It's an 'exciting blend of old and new' as a bad info sheet would say. It's also really heavy, and that's always good: super clear production and 235235-string guitars and all.\n\nOverall, 'ObZen' is what I expected and I'm really satisfied by what the band has managed to turn out. Meshuggah's been at it for over two decades now and they show no sign of slowing down; they just take their custom sound further with every new album and explore the niche they've so painstakingly carved in the modern metal scene. 'ObZen' is another great album from the Swedes and is unlikely to disappoint. 'Bleed' is awesome and you should get it just for how insane that track alone is because I think they've invented entirely new time signatures on it.\n",
        "\nThis is terrible, utterly terrible. I like Meshuggah, Destroy Erase Improve was for quite a while the heaviest thing I'd ever heard and they have been able to impress me fairly consistently, even the initially disappointing Nothing has grown me. But this is musical cancer. Not the musically equivalent of having cancer, but the cancer itself, killing all things musical and replacing them with this horrid, melody-free, music-free noise.\n\nWhat Meshuggah have done on this 21 minute song is go crazy on their time signatures and polymetrics, and forgotten about having any of the music matching up and well, being music, leaving us with this horrible shapeless mess. When they manage to get lucky, and have everything hold together as a unified piece, this is really up there as some of their best work, as there is a lot more energy on offer on this song than the band has offered in other releases around it\u2019s time. In fact, there are few sections I would straight up call fast, rather than a form of aggressive mid-paced attack.\n\nFor the main part, this is just a bland album, going from boring chug with tremolo to boring chug with tremolo for about 20 minutes, but there are a few moments that stick out. The problem is most of these moments stick out for a bad reason. In fact, I can think of exactly three moments where I enjoyed what was on offer, and I have to admit that 3:35-4:30 is a truly exceptional piece of listenable-yet-melody-free time signature absurdity. And in that regard, this truly does work better than anything in their discography. They\u2019re had better moments in their past, but those parts have always had melody. There's a couple (exactly two) of good sections after the first ambient break, but both run on for far too long, and are both inevitably ruined by the inclusion of Kidman's awful vocals.\n\nUnfortunately, the list of terribly painful sections is longer than that... much longer. Basically, everything which happens in the first 15 minutes that isn't what I just mentioned is horrid. The intro is initially boring, followed up by a pointless scream with some indistinct music behind it. Then when the actual song begins, you'll quickly see that this 2 minute section was completely unimportant and irrelevant. Haake has a few terrible sections to abuse us with, but I'll discuss more on that later. And ALL of the riffs suck. All of them, every single one. They are all, without exception, easy to play low chords chugging away mindlessly. Luckily, the last 6 minutes or so are just boring to the point of insanity, so you won't take notice enough to hate it much, which is partly due to the song ending with the same riff over and over for two and a half minutes. \n\nI'm disappointed by most of the band on this album. Haake is easily as good technically speaking as he's ever been, but musically he is at his very worst. Random snare abuse, where Haake decides he needs his snare to be more involved in the song more, so he bashes it like bully hitting a fat slightly retarded kid, is rampant. The most frequent occurrence of this is usually due awkward timing of the snare usage, for instance 12:05 through to about 14 minutes in, the timing just seems off. This is all over the place. But, admittedly more rare, but far worse, the snare is non stop, incessant and irritating. 6:20 through to 7:50 is enough to drive a deaf man to a migraine, it's like a slow blast beat while nothing else is trying to keep up with it. It's all technically impressive; he changes his foot rhythms without missing a beat with his hands. But it sounds like utter shit.\n\nThe guitar work is heavily influenced by Thorendal's own solo project from a few years back. So expect some seriously bizarre work (in fact a few parts are directly lifted I believe, as with Catch 33), unfortunately a lot of it feels quite second rate ideas. And like Catch 33, long periods of time are spent around ambient sections, and building up out of them. There's not too much in the way of soloing, And not a whole lot of straight up riffing. In fact, most of the string work tends to be one guitarist playing the rhythm using very simple to play yet random sounding thuds, while the other tremolos his ass off in the background. There is some solid work in the first half of the song, but somewhere between the first and second ambience breaks the already rare interesting riffage stops, and you get left with this proper riff free sound, and it's boring. There's nothing on offer but the rhythms.\n\nHagstrom, however has one weapon on his side. He wrote the lyrics, which are fantastic. A chaotic, violent form of poetry. Really, the lyrics are up there with their best lyrical work. And let\u2019s face it, Meshuggah lyrics kick ass.\n\nUnfortunately, the usually proficient delivery method of these brilliant lyrics, Jens Kidman seems to be having an off day. He just sounds like any random guy, just like any of the countless nameless hardcore screamers in the world of metalcore right now. It's not a precise as before, and therefore lacks that beautifully percussive, robotic edge. There isn\u2019t any depth or roughness to his voice, it's just a scream, there\u2019s no growl or grunt even hinting in the vocals. No, Jens never did anything like death growls, but there was a little bit more of a rough edge to his screams than what\u2019s on offer on this release.\n\nI'm not sure why so many Meshuggah fans are nutting in their pants over this, it's not any more complex than usual, the rhythms are more complex, but the music being played is far more simple than usual, not much harder than Nothing. So without have any real technicality to marvel at, all you have to appreciate on this release is the music; which is disgusting beyond belief. It's not interesting enough to be music you focus on, while at the same time it's too annoying to leave on as a background listen. Honestly, I haven't heard too much that is worse to listen to than this. And I\u2019ve heard quite a lot of Black Tribe. This is the bands peak of rhythm worship over all else, resulting in a disaster. You've got zero musical merit, zero actual instrumental technicality (apart from drums), traded for what? Some odd time signatures which make the album even less enjoyable! Sounds like a bad swap to me.\n",
        "\nWhen any discussion of Meshuggah comes into play, eventually it leads to Chaosphere. Indeed, Chaosphere is insidiously heavy, brutal, and punishing, and when you need insidiously brutal, Chaosphere gets the job done. It certainly works as a rap repellant, countering those uninspired beats and stupid rhymes with a good dose of good ol' fashioned heavy metal hate and aggression. \n\nHowever, when I want catchy (not necessarily melodic), weirdly enjoyable, robotic anthems that make me wanna get up and robot brakedance (if I only knew how), I turn to Nothing. Why? On Nothing, as opposed to previous albums, the songs are primarily rhythmic, with a few melodies here and there, and the drums are the song. The polyrhythms Haake plays here are often 4/4 with the cymbals/hihat and some other weird rhythm with the bass drum, and the snare often alternates between the two. The songs here, instead of possession seemingly unending craziness, settle into an almost druglike groove, unrepentently going on and on, through all sorts of permutations and distortions, before climaxing and fading away in a hallucinogenic sea of madness. The solos are not particularly technical compared to everything else Meshuggah has done, but they are indeed catchy in a weird way, and interact with the rest of the instruments to create almost psychedelic patterns. The songs possess a slight hallucinogenic quality to them, because while Meshuggah seem chaotic at first, around this album, they settle into an ordered chaos, chaos that has run its course, and is now resembling order as the chaotic barrage of information congregates into a mosaic incomprehensible but beautiful all the same. \n\nThis sound familiar? If not, then try acid. Either way, Nothing is probably Meshuggah's best, as the atmosphere on here is killer and the rhythms are ingenius.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah is one of the bands to prove repeatedly that the \"thinking man's metal\" label may flatter the listener, but nonetheless bore him or her to tears. Maybe Meshuggah is a true colossus of post-industrial terror, or maybe it is the dynamite truck of some friendly folks striving to achieve the unbelievable through their odd signatures and some of the worst riffs in the history of music, adding some tuff guy screams on the top. I'd say that both possibilities can be thought as parts of this whole, the second possibility being more prominent. \n\nThis album stands confortably as their least worst album in the gallery of horrors that followed Destroy Erase Improve, because it actually has some riffs that come close to catchy. Because of the annoying drumming combined with less than unmemorable riffs, Meshuggah failed most of the time. And this album opener, Combustion, may I say, is a true keeper deserving its title! It beats some of the songs on Lich King's Necromantic Maelstrom easily in terms of originality and passion. Yes, you've read well. It has a ferocious drum performance, and great riffs (probably the most complex and melodic riffs on this album). Combustion should be noted as one of the best thrash songs of this year, if we don't take the uselessness of the solo and the stupid polyrhythmic turns into consideration. The vocalist could've been a machine as well. You won't make any difference between the human and a tape or environmental noises. And, of course, that's dehumanized and thus metal as hell, right? \n\nThe rest of the album is made of the stuff that a casual Meshuggah album is made of. Seldom do we stumble upon a more melodic riff, and they respect completely Meshuggah's standards of uncatchiness. What the fuck is there so fascinating in a two-note or three-note riff where an occasional bonus note appears or instead of A-B-C one plays C-A-B? This goes way too surreal, even by my standards. All the riffs sound very bassy and clanging, which is not a good option when you're playing extremely boring riffs. I mean, if you try your hand at something complex (I said that you're playing complex, not sticking your fingers to the chords in different orders), that would work. But that case doesn't occur here. The lead guitar tone is catastrophic, to state it more indulgently, all the solos are nothing but watered-down prog stuff and recycled melodies. \n\nThe drumming? What sort of polyrhythms are these? I do feel when a bonus note appears and the tempo is slightly modified, and still I'm not having any boner because of this. You don't expect being loudly acclaimed just for removing a beat or adding a beat, do you? I'd sell my soul to see this guy playing some more inventive polyrhythms, like Eddie Prevost. Not only does he lack a certain flexibility, but he thinks that his polyrhythms are so unique that he doesn't need any drum fills. And, of course, he removes almost any trace of a drum fill on this album. The crash cymbal is abused, abused to tears, shreds and metal shards, and it's driving the listener crazy while footed in the beginning of sleep. \n\nThis is all I can say of an album which is fairly good by Meshuggah standards, but doesn't quite accomplish mine and very, very many others'. Hey, but it's a Meshuggah album! And when I'm thinking of the rating that I'd have given to a Chaosphere or a Nothing, I'm smiling and whistling joyfully in front of this. Boy, isn't it cool to be an unthinking man.\n",
        "\nObZen ranks among Meshuggah's best work. It is of similar quality as None (EP), Destroy Erase Improve, and I (EP). Its overall sound is fairly similar to I and Catch Thirty Three, but its songs are more straightforward and accessible. It also sounds more like Tool and King Crimson than previous releases. The lead guitarist's solos and the \"angular\" rhythms are especially reminiscent of certain albums from those bands. As with previous Meshuggah albums, there are also elements that sound similar to Voivod, Godflesh, Helmet, and Ministry. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this album is its dynamic mixture of light and heavy, soft and hard... yin and yang. Many of the world's best bands successfully combine intensity with serenity. Prime examples of this include Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, King Crimson and, of course, Meshuggah. \n\nObZen is also a good starter album for those who have never previously listened to Meshuggah. It contains numerous similarities to previous albums but has the potential to appeal to a slightly broader audience. ObZen is experimental and technical enough to appeal to progressive metal snobs, but it is also accessible enough to attract the masses. This band deserves all the praise it gets, and it merits even greater popularity. ObZen may not procure the mass appeal it deserves, but maybe it will set the stage for Meshuggah's next album to dominate the world of metal. Honestly, this band has what it takes to be the number one band in metal.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, despite such a repetitive style, Meshuggah, for me, never seems to loose its magnetism. I think \"Bleed\" is a perfect example of this. it's this one rip-roaring repetition over 7:25, but I can't stop listening to it. I crave it. \n\nI love how they've incorporated all of the elements that make them such a fantastic and original band, from the simplistic chug to the complicated math riff to the crushing slow doom chords and bouncing grooves, not to forget the spinning, revolving scale solos and the ambient acoustic interjections. This album has a much more varied sound compared to their previous releases. I also appreciate that they did not get caught up in their Catch-33 masterpiece sound. They know how to progress as a group and still retain their style. \n\nIt feels like each song on this album requires a different type of listening. For example, Bleed is a thrash-headbang scream-along as opposed to Pineal Gland Optics which has a loose descending progression to it. Each song creates a different atmosphere, a different world in which to explore the same sound. I feel like Meshuggah have stretched themselves on this release, although there's definitely room for progression. We all have yet to see Meshuggah truly take the reigns of their own genius and journey into the obscure and obscene corridors that they have more than enough potential to explore. I hope for their next release we hear more experimentation.\n\nObZen is a brilliant release to both dig into and to casually headbang to. People tend to be too critical of this band, but I suggest giving this one, if you don't feel like you understand it at first, a few spins before you bash it because these guys have some serious talent and creative genius. \n\nEnjoy.\n",
        "\nNew album... back to their roots... fusing most previous styles... etc etc. Musically, this is definitely Meshuggah's most varied album, and for that it should mostly be liked by all Meshuggah fans. It features some of their most intense and some of their most lethargic material. Listening to some of these tracks, I am getting the same feeling I got from first listening to metal - never before have I heard anything quite like some of the things I witness here; never have Meshuggah been so damn amazing.\n\nFor starters, the production is obScene, the best they've had. I always felt that the production of the drum-machine releases suffered by feeling slightly artificial, but that has been nicely corrected. The refusal to obEy normal timings is present as usual, every I drank a shot every time I got blissfully confused whilst listening to the polyrhythms here, I would now be incredibly obEse. On top of this, all of the members give their best performance to date, thanks to the varied nature of the songs. The atmosphere is not quite as intense and claustrophobic as Catch33, (which many will see as a good thing), but for me this is a step backwards - perhaps one necessary to move forwards in the future).\n\n\"Bleed\" is my standout track, I have never heard such an incredible all round performance. This is the single track from the album, for obVious reasons. \"Dancers to a Discordant System\" is the obLigatory long track that Meshuggah have grown to love doing, but this one is far more consistent than \"In Death - Is Death\", and more down-to-earth than \"I\". There are a few moments of not-so-much-filler-but-slightly-boring parts on the album, such as the Fear Factory-esque intro to ObZen, or most of \"This Spiteful Snake\" - a track which sounds like it was taken from possible extra tracks for Nothing. However, these few sections are easily covered up by the brilliance of everything else.\n\nIn short, I am not quite sure what the 11% reviewer was trying to say, but imagine the exact opposite and you have ObZen. \n\nAtmosphere: 82%\nProduction: 94%\nSongwriting: 89%\nIndividual Performances: 99%\nLastability/ Replayability: 92%\n\nTotal: 91.2%\n",
        "\nSo here we are, Fredrik Thordendal and co. emerge once again with a new album. Meshuggah lovers and haters alike have come to expect certain things from Meshuggah, horrendously catchy drop-Z chugs, awe-inspiring drumming and a total wall of noise sound being just a few of them. While obZen certainly does not lack these characteristics, there is a something a little different here from the Meshuggah norm. It is immediately noticeable that album opener \u2018Combustion\u2019 is actually fairly straightforward, considering the puzzling complexity that normally comes with a track from this band. However, it still possesses that incredibly intense atmosphere that shrouds everything the band has ever done. As mentioned by drummer Tomas Haake, \u2018obZen\u2019 really draws on the band\u2019s entire back catalogue. There\u2019s very thrashy and aggressive riffs reminiscent of 1991\u2019s \u2018Contradiction\u2019s Collapse\u2019 and at the same time it is blended with the incredibly complicated rhythms of their most recent material from \u2018Catch 33\u2019. There is the added dimension of the eight string guitar, providing Fredrik Thordendal and M\u00e5rten Hagstr\u00f6m with a low F string (you heard me, it\u2019s a semitone off of E standard, but an octave lower) with which to pummel your ears into submission. Another nice fact is that the drumming machine Tomas Haake has returned to the kit after simply programming the drums on their last effort, \u2018Catch 33\u2019.\n\nThis album is ridiculously tight, ridiculously intense and as always, some of the most headbangable music you will ever come across. Every member knows what they are doing, and all of them pull it off with extreme finesse. Fredrik Thordendal and Martin Hagstrom are still laying down insane grooves and spicing them up with overdubbed jazzy leads that add another layer of atmosphere to the Meshuggah sound which might otherwise be getting stale. The sheer intensity of the band\u2019s delivery is astonishing, and even songs which do not immediately stick out, such as \u2018This Spiteful Snake\u2019, possess a power which compels the listener to listen to more despite their relentless attack utterly confounding their brain functions. Crushing.\n\nIn a band like Meshuggah, where the entirely dominant forces of the guitar and the drums hog the spotlight, it can be difficult to get any sort of poetic meaning across. However, I have always felt that vocalist Jens Kidman is just as vital a part to Meshuggah as Thordendal or Haake, and on \u2018obZen\u2019, his incredibly aggressive shouts retaining the same power they have had since day one, 21 years ago. As far as lyrics go, Kidman manages to bring forward another full text of philosophy and brutality all described with such rich imagery that you can almost see the lyrics unfolding to the ever-changing pulse of music. Even though the messages behind the lyrics of Meshuggah have never been incredibly interesting, they are delivered in such a powerful way that they speak to you without you even knowing exactly what they\u2019re about. Coupled with what has to be Jens Kidman\u2019s best performance yet (especially on the closing \u2018Dancers To A Discordant System\u2019), this set of lyrics is, once more, just plain badass.\n\nLove \u2018em or hate \u2018em, you simply cannot deny that Meshuggah are one of the most gelled units in western music. The interlocked chemistry between each one of the band members is astonishing, and the constant quality of their output despite their moderate experimentation from album to album is very respectable. \u2018obZen\u2019 as an album, however, is business as usual. This is not a problem as Meshuggah\u2019s business as usual is the sort of music that most bands could make one record of in their entire career, but yet again I was disappointed that the pure genius of their magnum opus, \u2018Chaosphere\u2019, was not matched. Perhaps this would be a good introduction album to Meshuggah, encompassing everything that is the band\u2019s niche, but even for long-time Meshuggah fans, tracks like \u2018Bleed\u2019, \u2018Dancers To A Discordant System\u2019 and \u2018obZen\u2019 alone make this album an essential purchase.\n\nOriginally written for www.ultimate-guitar.com review team.\n",
        "\nFor those who are not yankees and therefore may not know who Ben Stein is, he is an actor/comedian who is known for talking in a very monotonous voice at the same pace.... every line, every movie, no matter what emotion he should be showing. It's funny when Ben Stein does it, but not when a couple of really technical Swedes try it out. Imagine Stein getting extremely pissed off, and honestly screaming for about 45 minutes, all while bashing some household items together and kicking an electric guitar. That's a pretty decent description of Meshuggah. They have garnered a fanbase about as large, blind, and stupid as Opeth's by playing super technical chugging, pseudo groove-thrash riffs. Don't let the word \"technical\" confuse you, this isn't overly technical like Necrophagist tends to be, there aren't notes all over the place and random ass melodies for no reason. No no, this is quite the opposite. The songs are on average about four and a half minutes, some being a little over three minutes and others being just shy of six. Long songs aren't bad, but I can count about four notes per song. I'm not joking, when there isn't a disjointed and rhythmically challenged \"solo\" being thrown at you, the entire record is repetitive and meandering chug riffs that evolve about as much as a fucking dinosaur.\n\nI can draw a lot of parallels to Opeth here, as they both share a similar rabid fanbase, for reasons I can never understand. The riffs are all, ALL, boring two/three note riffs that move along for about a minute and a half, all with the \"uber technical\" drums driving the riffs along, with bullshit crappy screaming and atonal (the bad kind, not the cool Slayer-esque atonal) solos with zero sense of rhythm. Sure, solos aren't supposed to be strictly rhythmic, but I've heard similar solos from my little brother when he first picked up a guitar when he was 11 and just flailed on the high E. The leads aren't the main problem though, it's the goddamn \"riffs\". There is an average of about three \"riffs\" per song, and they all consist of jumpy chug rhythms in bizarre time signatures.\n\nThe tag \"progressive\" is attached to Meshuggah a lot, and this makes about as much sense as an inflatable dartboard. This music never progresses.... EVER. I move for the metal subgenre naming committee to change \"progressive\" to \"talented\", because that's all that seems to be needed to label a band as a prog band anymore. There is no denying, they super complex time signatures and admittedly impressive drumming style of Tomas Haake prove that these are all talented men (barring that god awful vocalist). Haake's drumming is unique in the sense that he apparently (this means according to Meshuggah fanboys, so I should probably be skeptical) drums with his top half in 4/4 time, while his feet play in whatever complex polyrhythm the current song is in. This unfortunately means that every song has a basic snare/cymbal routine going on while the drums beat in exact time with whatever monotonous riff is playing.... ie: boring ass drum patterns that do nothing to captivate the listener.\n\nMy god, this album is torture, I'd rather take a drill bit sodomy. I won't lie, it starts off cool enough, Future Breed Machine happens to catch you at first. It's actually kind of catchy, yet at the same time annoyingly monotonous. You start to hope that maybe it'll get better, and that they inexplicably chose the shittiest track to start off with. Well, you'd be wrong. Future Breed Machine is sadly the best song on the whole abomination of a record. Acrid Placidity gets an honorable mention for not descending into the chugga chugga snoozefest we'd gotten used to by that point in the album. It is still needlessly discordant and stupid though, which really sucks. These guys are obviously immensely talented, but just as with Opeth or Dream Theater, they can't write a captivating song to save their life. Every last song is just a showcase for how precise of musicians they are. That's all well and good, but one cannot get by on technicality alone.\n\nAnother bad album by a relentlessly overhyped band. Part of me really wants to enjoy this, but I just can't. The riffs are monotonous and boring, the vocalist just screams at the top of his lungs for the whole time without any change in tone or delivery, the drums are technically impressive, but sonically boring as hell, and about as entertaining as watching old people fuck.\n",
        "\nMasters of the most mind-boggling polyrhythms, Meshuggah, return after 3 years with a stunning album that will give the haters of C33 and Nothing a run for their money. obZen continues the basic formula of no chorus and no general direction of the song other than small instrumental sections between verses and solos. Oddly enough, this doesn't get old. In fact, it feels a lot better on this album than almost every album they've wrote. This album is full of goodies and all kinds of head-to-the-pavement riffs and even some ridiculously bone-crushing breakdowns, mainly in \"obZen\", \"Pineal Gland Optics\" and \"Lethargica\". \n\nSome of the most intelligent riffs ever written are on tracks \"Dancers to a Discordant System\" and \"Pineal Gland Optics.\" They reek of beautiful design and well-structured, well-thought out production. Something only Meshuggah could do. Something they did in this CD was add some of the most memorable riffs and outros ever created. They aren't your standard, generic blast-beat intros, or your typical 4-note solos or even in the case of obZen, breakdowns. No shitty metalcore breakdowns exist in this album, only original breakdowns. Speaking of intelligent music, Meshuggah continue their theme on confusing as hell lyrics that have to do with paradoxes or just other spatial things. They are almost impossible to understand, but great for laughing at when you hear something entirely wrong. \n\nobZen has things that the other CDs lack, which is atmosphere. If you pay close enough attention (didn't catch this until my 3rd or 4th listen) you can hear Fredrik's two-note atmospheric guitar playing throughout most songs. It adds a subliminal atmospheric sound that just adds to the overall amazingness of this CD. In addition, Jen's vocals are a lot more catchy on this CD. Not to say he lightened up (he sounds as fierce as ever), but it's the way he sings on \"Dancers to a Discordant System\" that gives me chills. \n\nAll in all, an exceptional and mesmerizing album that will leave you with your mouth hanging open until you finally get the consciousness to play it again and again until your stereo is sick of hearing it, in which the next Meshuggah album will be released.\n\n97%\n",
        "\nThere's generally no middle ground concerning this band. That's not a hard and fast rule, but as a general rule, there are Meshuggah haters and Meshuggah lovers. And it doesn't matter what side of the fence you reside - this band will still be here, pumping out their math-metal polyrhythms, which they do again on their 6th full-length album, \"ObZen\".\n\nNow, first things first: If you don't like Meshuggah, this album won't change your views of that. This album has the same technicalities as previous albums. But what is different?\n\nSpeed. Where Nothing and Catch 33 (one of the best albums ever, in my humble opinion) were a slower beast, this one picks up the speed a little. Tracks like \"Bleed\" and \"Pineal Gland Optics\" show that they can still deliver speed when they want to, but by now it seems they are more interested in being technical, with tracks like \"Lethargica\" and \"This Spiteful Snake\". But just because they're slow does not mean they are bad. \"Lethargica\" is one of the heaviest tracks on the album.\n\nAlso, where \"Catch 33\", and even \"Nothing\" plods along, there appears to me a lot more hooks in this one:\n- \"Bleed\" is probably the best song they've recorded in 10 years. Monotonous, yes, but thrashy and memorable. 1:24 really gets the brain banging.\n- The fade-out riffs on \"Lethargica\" and \"Pineal Gland Optics\" are excellent, especially the former.\n- 1:10 at \"Electric Red\" contains an excellent riffing passage. Basically sums up Meshuggah in the space of 20 seconds.\n- Opening riff on \"Pravus\" may be simple for the drummer's standards, but it does its job of leading into the song perfectly.\nThere are many more, but these sum it up nicely.\n\nThey have also ditched their experimental stages, circa \"I\" and \"Catch 33\", and went back to writing individual songs. While the album doesn't flow as much as those, for obvious reasons, it makes up for it in creating great songs that have a great amount of replay value in them. I also feel that was something they needed to do, as to not start pigeonholing themselves as an experimental band. Incidentally, all the band members sound like they're having fun on this album...it doesn't feel as structured or mechanical as \"I\" or \"Catch 33\", and that has a positive effect on the groove and general feel.\n\nOne song that deserves a particular mention would be the opener, \"Combustion\". It does not contain any polyrhythms and it's pretty much an all-out thrash song. This sounds like a callback to Contradictions Collapse, all the way back in 1991. And they do this well, too. A very up-beat way to open the album.\n\nThere is no point in mentioning any other songs particularly, as they are all quite good and sound complete. It really sounds like they had fun recording it, and it goes to show that even in this stage of their careers, Meshuggah still know how to create a crushing album full of groove, heaviness, speed, creativity, tightness, and replayability. This is probably their second-best album (behind \"Catch 33\" - nothing they do will probably beat that), and I eagerly await what they do in the future.\n\nBest tracks: Combustion, Bleed, Lethargica, Pravus\n",
        "\nMeshuggah have always prided themselves as being rather excellent modern-day pioneers of super, super technical post-thrash metal (or as some would even call them \u201cmath metal\u201d or the \u201cmasters of math metal\u201d). They are always excellent with having very complex, technical, ostentatiously strange scales and song structures that are not only catchy, but mind-boggling and hypnotizing. \n\nFor their newest LP, ObZen, it is a reasonably consistent product of both futuristically \u201croboto\u201d vibe and funky groove of technicality. However, it seems that the band are beginning to stagnate into self-repetition and need to be a bit more cautious in their approach with making sure they are not simply rehashing their newest songs from previous songs of older albums.\n\nFor example, the album ObZen is a very good album, but the first four tracks don\u2019t really grab this intrepid listener all too well. It has some of its highlights, but for the most part is quite boring after so many continuously contrived intervals \u2013 not with each song listened over to repetitively, but with each song listened to once in it\u2019s naturally played sequence \u2013 that they begin to sound familiar to parts of songs dating back from \u2018Chaosphere\u2019 to \u2018Catch 33.\u2019 I almost fell asleep at one point during the first four tracks.\n\nThings don\u2019t really start to improve or kick up several notches until the title track comes in. THEN the LP thickens! It seems that this album struggles a little bit at first like an old carburetor, but if you give it a chance it will start roaring like a Ferrari, until it starts sputtering again, very slightly at the last track, \u201cDancers to a Discordant System,\u201d in which I can hear parts of the song that remind me of other songs from \u2018Nothing,\u2019 the \u2018I\u2019 EP and \u2018Catch 33\u2019 \u2013 again!\n\nConclusively, it is a good piece of work for these Swedish math metalists, but not great considering the musical equations don\u2019t quite match up to the final sum. Therefore, Meshuggah should be more careful not to overdo the \u201ctremolo trigonometry\u201d before the fractions of the fretwork bore the interest of the listener.\n",
        "\nThis EP, Meshuggah's 2004 release, is actually just one very, very long (21 minutes long) song. That said, this is close to, if not THE finest piece of music I've heard from Meshuggah.\n\nTHAT said, the beginning can get a little annoying. It's about 1 1/2 minutes of the same basic riff and slight variations. Sometimes I can listen through it, sometimes I have to fast-forward. All of a sudden, everything stops for a second, before descending into pure chaos for about 20 seconds. The riff that follows is similar to the opening riffs, but not identical. Since this riff isn't played for 1 1/2 minutes and it's accompanied by Jens KIdman's insane vocal delivery, it's a lot easier to stomach.\n\nThere are some more great riffs afterwards, but the two highlights of this song are the two solos. The first one, beginning at about 5:35 in the song, is a seriously beefed up and much longer version of Fredrik Thordendal (Meshuggah's lead guitarist)'s standard fret-tapping solos, and it feels like the apocalypse is taking place right there in your ears. The second solo , somewhere between 10-12 minutes into the song, is not quite as crazy, but still has an \"alien\" quality to it. Seriously, I don't think there are many people who can create and play solos like Thordendal does.\n\nAfter the solos, the song starts to slow down for a while, while still pumping out sweet riffs, eventually ending with a long fadeout.\n\nThe musicianship on this album (including Kidman's near-demonic vocal job) is probably the best of any Meshuggah album released thus far. If you are looking for Nothing's weirdness with Chaosphere and DEI's speed and intensity, with a little bit of extra weirdness and intensity, this album will probably suit you well.\n\nBest tracks: That's a tough one. Thee are so many to choose from!\n",
        "\nFirst, it's important to say that this is not an actual studio album. The songs range from previously unreleased but newer material to material from their first EP. That said, most of this album is very, very good, with a couple of tracks standing out in particular.\n\n\"War\" starts the album off to a flying start, and is easily the heaviest and fastest song on the CD. It's pretty good, but not outstanding. Tomas Haake did not play the drums on this track. Instead, they were programmed using his \"Drumkit From Hell\" program. This one seems more death metal-ish because of the riffs, high tempo and the appearance of blast beats in a few parts.\n\n\"Cadaverous Mastication\" appeared on Contradictions Collapse, but the version on this disc, along with the next two songs, \"Sovereign's Morbidity\" and \"Debt of Nature\", are from their first EP. I'm not digging the vocals that much on these three songs, but musically, each one kicks plenty of ass. \"Debt of Nature\" has a very nice melodic interlude that you would never expect to hear from Meshuggah towards the middle. \"Sovereign's Morbidity\" is more of an all-out thrasher.\n\n\"By Emptiness Abducted\" starts out with a nice riff. The verse riff is a little weird, but this is in fact Meshuggah we're talking about. \"Don't Speak\" is faster and much more intense, with alot of dissonance in the riffs.\n\n\"Abnegating Cecity\" I could never get into that much for some reason. Same with the next one, \"Internal Evidence\". Anyway, the versions here are from a 1990 demo, not the later versions which appeared on Contradictions Collapse. The song is almost exactly the same, although I noticed the solo near the beginning is a bit different. They're far from bad, but they aren't really all that good either.\n\n\"Concatenation (remix)\" is a heavily slowed down version of the song on Chaosphere. It's easier to headbang to, and delivers a bigger punch than the original. Even the solo is slowed down, and sounds really bizarre, even compared to the original solo.\n\nAnd now we're down to the grand finale, the track good enough to end a very good album...or is it? Of course I'm talking about \"Ayahuasca Experience\". For those wondering, ayahuasca is a drink used by some people to induce intense hallucinations. The title gives you a pretty good idea of what you're going to hear in this \"song\". It's just really, really weird, and even the band admits in the booklet that they don't even remember recording it because they were so fucked up. It definitely shows, guys from Meshuggah.\n\nThere are also three videos on the CD. \"New Millenium Cyanide Christ,\" a live version of \"Elastic,\" and random clips of the band. These are pretty cool videos.\n\nThe musicianship, as usual with this band, is top-notch. I would strongly recommend it for Meshuggah fans looking to hear some of their lesser-known songs, and curious to hear different versions of a couple of songs.\n\nBest songs: \"Soveregin's Morbidity,\" \"Debt of Nature,\" \"Concatenation (Remix)\"\n",
        "\nThe isn't my least favorite Meshuggah album per se, but it is probably the one I willingly listen to the least, just because I don't generally have the attention span required to absorb it all, because, as you know, the whole album is one song split into a bunch of different tracks. So no individual track is going to carry any meaning, since they generally have one or two riffs each at most, and at least repeat the same riffs over multiple tracks (the first two tracks do this, and the third has a variation on that one riff), and if you want to get the 'real experience', you'll have to sit down for the whole forty-seven-minute running time of the album. Rarely, very rarely, does the mood strike me to listen to that much of what comes down to variations on the same general riff and musical ideas. Meshuggah has been repetitive for quite some time now, but never have they been this punishingly ambient. Because that's what this really is: ambient music. Not metal; it just happens to have heavy guitars, drums (or drum machine, actually) and gruff, shouting vocals.\n\nAmbient music thrives off of small degrees of change over long periods of time, which is also something that Meshuggah thrives off of, but never before have the changes been so slow and tiny, resulting in collections of change that you don't notice until ten minutes later when you realize you're listening to something completely different. In that regard, it's very organic music, as mechanical as it is. Stylistically, as far as instrumental sound goes, it's still Meshuggah, though it is generally less dense than the superheavy, superthick compositions on albums like 'Chaosphere', with more spacious, mid-paced riffing taking up good chunks of the album's running time. They're still crazy time signature'd as ever, but the guitars and drums seem to do less battle with each other and mesh a bit more naturally than usual. There's no grinding industrial madness like 'New Millenium Cyanide Christ', and there are even points on the album where Meshuggah seems to harken back to the marginally more gentle 'Destroy Erase Improve' days with tracks like 'Mind's Mirrors', which is sort of this album's equivalent to 'Acrid Placidity'.\n\nWhile it's very well put together in an abstract way, I don't find the songs (or song, rather) as enjoyable as those on other Meshuggah albums. I appreciate it more than 'Chaosphere' because it has a greater level of ambition behind it; there's a lot of rote high/low chugging, but it's rote high/low chugging with a supposed sense of purpose behind it. At the same time, a lot of the rote high/low chugging isn't very interesting to hear. This is a more rhythmically dependent album than perhaps any Meshuggah release before it, and rhythm only keeps me SO interested; sometimes I want something to grab my attention more than just awkward rhythms and riffs. I don't know, I guess I'd prefer this album if it were a bit more artistic and a bit less mathematical. It almost feels like the release was machined out based on mathematical computations more than it was composed by real people, and the occasional 'warm' moment, like the dissonant, hovering lead guitar or the synthesized vocals on 'Mind's Mirrors' have a sort of uncanny valley effect that just draws attention even more to how mechanical the whole album is.\n\nThis is another one of those albums that I like substantially more as a theoretical piece than as an album to be listened to for the purpose of entertainment. It's good for study, and showing friends what metal can be like, and challenging yourself, and doing a million things that really don't have anything to do with simply listening at all. It's not like this is offensive; I can put it on in the background and it never distracts me, but that's precisely the problem: it never distracts me because everything is moving in such a crawling and overtly smooth fashion that it all seems to go by both very quickly and almost painfully slowly at once. It's an album that's full of moments but doesn't seem to have any movement, if that makes sense. I prefer Meshuggah when they're more song-y, though this is cool in some ways.\n",
        "\nI was fortunate enough to hear an advance copy of ObZen, and I must say it is a stunning album! Meshuggah seem to have collated their styles from all their previous albums and out of the metal madness has come a rich, diverse and interesting album, one that will be instantly familiar to the Meshuggah fan, yet somehow bringing something new. \n\nObZen contains elements of all Meshuggahs' previous work: The heavy thrashiness of their earlier albums, combined with the more technical and progressive style of their later ones, with the always recognisable vocal qualities of Jens Kidman angrily yelling out the lyrics over the top of the insanity. We still have the driving riffs of albums like \"I\" and \"Chaosphere\" and the relentless drumming that seems to permeate every album. We have the wonderful technically complex guitar solos that are prevalent in many of their albums, and we have the pure heavy metal feel that runs the whole way through the album.\n\nSome might claim that using styles from previous works is not progressive and that it doesn't move the band anywhere. I would argue that Meshuggah are good enough, both instrumentally and in their thinking to create a new sound from the old - they have taken aspects of things that work and formed a fantastic new sound. This sound, while obviously Meshuggahs, can still surprise and thrill.\n\nAs many Meshuggah fans will know, their name is a Hebrew word for \"crazy\" and while no-one needs reminding of the fact that the band lives up to this name in every aspect of their music, ObZen once again reminds us that Meshuggah can be muscially brilliant whilst being chaotic, crazy and always unexpected.\n",
        "\nThere are many anomalies and mysteries in our world, hell our very own universe; things that tap into the very core of our underlying existence and the discovery of these answers would no doubt resonate heavily through all human beings regardless of race, age or creed. If I personally had the chance to even begin to understand a sliver of a mystery of my choice I'd have to go with the most logical question; why the fuck do people insist on liking Meshuggah? I just don't get it, I really don't. Meshuggah have spent the past 20 years doing little more than bash out power chords at varying speeds in varying time signatures, with the rhythm section doing the whole zany time signature thing too whilst a Rottweiler is put on vocal duty. By the time they had reached 'Nothing' the band was essentially doing just that, they'd slowed down so considerably I had trouble remembering I even had the album playing and of course when 'Catch 33' came along I could leave the room to make a few slices of toast and come back without fear of being lost. At that rate of progression I was sure we'd see Meshuggah attempt drone doom which would have not only been preferable to what was released but also fucking hilarious. 'Obzen' (oh fuck the whole upper/lower case wank, that's so Korn-esque it's lamentable) sees Meshuggah speed their sound up, back to somewhere around 'Destroy Erase Improve'-era and doing what they've always done.\n\nIt's nice to see the speed increase but unfortunately they don't deem it ideal to actually begin to write some proper, balls to the wall metal riffs at all which makes me only loathe this band even more. They are an extremely talented bunch of musicians who are pissing away their skills to make an album that sounds like a blender filled with shrapnel and batteries. Maybe the rhythm guitarist's hand is permanently paralysed into the shape of a power chord and they're loathed to kick him out of the band? That's the only slightly feasible reason I can see for this band to STILL be playing this down tuned bollocks, otherwise I can only assume they're all lazy cockbites who wet their pants at the mention of words like 'innovation' and 'thrash metal'. Even the solos feel unoriginal and sluggish, being nothing more than meandering about the fret board for about 10 seconds before repeating the same scale a few times in that sickly and weak guitar tone. The rhythm section is tight but at times the drums feel a bit lethargic and bored, the bass isn't very audible but it's certainly there under the banal 'riff' in each song. Meshuggah's vocalist is so tediously monotonous, but it suits the music because it's so fucking boring that by having someone sing with any degree of emotion or talent would throw the whole thing off balance in a similar fashion of having an elephant on motorcycle and deciding that it should be giving a giraffe a piggy-back as well.\n\nI can't be bothered going on and on about the musical details because I'm pretty sure everyone and their dog has heard a Meshuggah album by now and the variance of style from album to album is so petty you'd be forgiven for thinking that the band suffered from a bout of amnesia after the making of each one. The real issue is why does this band get so much recognition despite their inability to actually write some real heavy metal? Meshuggah is essentially nu-metal for people who don't like to admit they like listening to nu-metal, the standard defence you hear every time they're put down is the droll chanting of \"They play in weird time signatures and utilise polyrhythms!\" which seems to be the equivalent of a \"Get Out of Jail Free Card\" but for berks who can't think of a single decent reason for why this band is real metal. Repetitive groove metal riffing is just that; go play it in 159/16 and it'll still sound like the same chug riffs played in 4/4 by the hordes of other brain-dead bands who believe that metal is all about being down tuned and heavy. Oh sure the chords will be timed differently but it's still completely obsolete and useless; a relic of metal history that I'm sure everyone would rather bury and lay to rest, there's no need to fuck the corpse of groove metal in an odd time signature just because you can.\n\nThere are so many more talented releases that are already out this year, I suggest you skip this exercise in unimaginative song writing and pick up an album that's worth spending your time on; maybe an album with some actual riffs would be a good starting place.\n",
        "\nYeah, twenty one minutes. I know what you're thinking. Immemorable? Hell no. This is actually catchier than some three or four minute songs. Yes, it is inaccessible at times, like even in MP4 format it takes up at least 18MB, compared to the usual 4 or 5, thus taking a lot of portable audio player memory up. But there are great riffs here, not as many as I would have wished for, but there is everything we love Meshuggah for.\n\nLiterally. There are fast riffs which occupy the first seven minutes or so, then there are the really heavy crushing riffs for another seven-ish minutes, then you have the newer Meshuggah groove riffs. All of these are seperated by quiet synth/clean guitar parts. The lyrics sheet is about a foot long, firing lyrics and phrases so complex they are almost incomprehensable - which is odd for a band whose main language is Swedish. Nevertheless, the lyrics are nice and apocalyptic, and enjoyable to read.\n\nOnto the song structure. It opends with dual tremolo picking and double bass for a minute and a half, then the whole band goes mental for another thirty seconds. Then it's back to the old skool, with some good thrashy riffs played under the first verse, which is followed by a lead overdub, then another bit of thrashy riffing, and another verse. Then there is a solo, which is really quite crazy (great, because the band's name is derived from the Yiddish word for crazy), followed by a mad blastbeat section. As an interlude, there is some clean guitar, until it bursts into another crazy riff, another verse, and probably the best riff the Swedes ever wrote. Maybe even the best written on more than six strings. Jens yells for a bit more, until the band decides to go into a syncrosized mental tornado that sounds like it's having convulsions. It all goes quiet, and there is now a clever concept which includes a chord played in distortion, followed by the same chord played in a clean tone. They then play some funky apreggios, with fade in notes in the background. In comes some distortion playing the same chords, and then for some plodding, but groovy riffs in typical modern Meshuggah style. One more verse and then an ending, which is drawn out, but I like it all the same.\n\nIt is a good song to do homework to, from my experiance. I love the whole conept of \"I\", it's all so doomy, and fits the apocalyptic theme of the lyrics perfectly. One confusing point, though, on the disc reads the single word \"Aj\", which is apparently Swedish for \"Ouch\". Lol Wut?\n\nSo, I would definately recommend it for any Meshuggah fan, maybe any open minded metal fan in general, as long as they have room for thoughts and quirkiness. I really like the song, even though I usually abstain from stupidly long songs. It has feeling, and is quite influential I must say.\n",
        "\nThis album is damned near perfect. I love Meshuggahs stuff - they always seem to be saying \"get lost\" to conventional sound, even conventional metal sound, and seem to go for chaotic, heavy noise. But what a noise it is! They have a definite \"sound\" to them - as in you always know that it is Meshuggah you are listening to, but it is a good sound, and in nowhere do you find it sounding better than in \"I\" \n\nThe album in itself is unusual, in that there is only one track, and it's 21 minutes long. The only other band I know who have done this is Edge of Sanity with their 40 minute long masterpiece, \"Crimson\" and I have to say that based on both these albums I have respect for bands that can do it! \nWhat you have with \"I\" is a crazy tour of differing style, with that ever present hint of psychotic heaviness and brutality that Meshuggah seem to do so well. \n\nIt starts off with a driving riff, and with it the knowledge that you are going to be in for an exciting ride. It is heavy and fast, and seems to be building up to something, but is it? For just when you begin to let your guard down (the intro goes on in the same style and rhythm for about 1 minute 40 seconds, and you begin to wonder what is happening) it kicks in with a scream, and absolute frenzied, hectic white noise. The first time I heard it, it made me jump, as I wasn't expecting it.\n\nAnd that, I think is the driving point behind Meshuggah - they love to keep you guessing! They don't have conventional climaxes, and the seem to enjoy making the listener second guess themselves, and yes, to make them jump. Many people I have heard talk about Meshuggah say that their music is very samey, and I too thought this for a while. But once you truly understand their style, and look a bit deeper into the craziness that creates their albums, you begin to realise how much is actually in their songs, and begin to appreciate the power and the skill behind what they do. \n\nAt different points in \"I\" you reach what I would call the \"Eye of the Storm\" in that it goes quite calm. This again brings up your guard, because you know that with the first few minutes you have been given, it's not going to stay calm for long. And you would be right. But again, the heaviness kicks in just after you begin to breath easy again. And yes, I jumped for the second time in the song.\n\nThis my friends is true music. This is exciting, challenging, heavy, brutal, and masterfully written. The drumming is fantastically insane - going full speed one minute and then stopping mid beat, only to return in an off-beat, once again catching the listener unawares. The guitars are pounding and relentless, and the solos are frantic and wonderfully fast.\n\nThe reason I only gave it 99 as opposed to 100? It's only 21 minutes long. I could easily have listened to twice the length of it, and I believe Meshuggah have the skill and the wild-eyed progressive experimentally insane vision to pull it off as well!\n",
        "\nIf only this full-length was released after the previous one and following two. One could quite easily state that it (DESTROY)ed Contradictions Collapse, it (ERASE)d Chaosphere from the memory and it (IMPROVE)d upon Nothing. Meshuggah's often chaotic, generally aggressive and undeniably technical approach to music is what has given them their rather large fanbase over the years. With a massive following comes a love/hate relationship. Generally when a band gains a certain amount of recognition their fans divide. The long standing fans who have seen it all and love the good old days and the newest fans who love the here and now. Meshuggah are a band whose fans fall exactly into that category. Although I haven't liked Meshuggah for long, and don't necessarily like them that much, I can't state precisely where I come in all of this. So, i'll sit on the fence and try to give an impartial opinion. \n\n\nDestroy Erase Improve follows a pattern. It's chaotic, much like every other release the band have issued to the world. It's based around technicalities and it fuses melody with aggressive to create an unstoppable force. Though a pattern exists, it's quite an unusual one given the fact that Meshuggah's sound has quite clearly changed. The pattern exists in the form of the underlying goal. The idea is to portray your lyrical themes, which are dowsed in emotion and raw feeling, in a manner that is incomparable to anyone else. Through sheer creativity and innovative exploration, Meshuggah have made a sound unlike anyone. Given that fact, Meshuggah deserves some credit. Though with several bands emerging on the scene that play a perhaps better style than Meshuggah's jazz fused brutal assault, Meshuggah are losing touch with reality. A sheer lack of structure is what they would find if they opened their eyes.\n\n\nIt's difficult to make something that no one else has in this day and age. They do this through using two very different styles. The first being a highly technical side and the second being a very industrial base. Experimentation is the name of the game. Though this is a very risky game. Odd time signatures are usually Meshuggah's downside when it comes to the audience. Odd time signatures are again a persistent nuisance throughout. They detract from the atmospheric touches Meshuggah attempt to add. They lack direction at times and can force the music to become somewhat subpar and cause it to lack substance. It makes it very hard to hold a high opinion of the music. Riff after riff churns out in an aggressive manner. The vocals are even more so aggressive than the riffs. The firm, forceful and self-assured vocals have always been the main negative for me. I can't get into them at all. They irritate me and sound robotic, which I suppose suits the music which has a very mechanised feel.\n",
        "\n'Chaosphere' was the first Meshuggah album I ever acquired, and as it stands, it's the one I have the most mixed feelings about. Coming off the heels of the magnificent 'Destroy Erase Improve', the music on the following album dropped a great deal of its original post-thrash roots in favor of pure industrial/technical brutality, consequently resulting in a great deal less variation and a great deal more focus. This is the favorite album of many dedicated Meshuggah fans for precisely this reason: it earmarks the absolute cementing of the band's style, and when you think of the music that Meshuggah does, a song like 'The Mouth Licking What You've Bled' is probably what pops into your mind: refined technical aggression with ultra-low chugging riffs, atonal tapping leads, brutally ejaculated vocals, and an overall sense of attacking the listener from as many angles as possible, all wrapped up in a bow of bizarre time signatures and bombastic delivery and production. It is, however, a somewhat bittersweet change: there's roughly no chance of Meshuggah ever going back to the style on 'Contradictions Collapse', and, at least to me, that's somewhat regrettable.\n\nIn truth, though, I probably owe more to this album than any other in the world. My entry into the world of true metal was courtesy of a live Meshuggah concert when they were (rather inexplicably) opening for System Of A Down. When they began their performance, my tiny twelve year old brain was nearly incinerated by the pure brutality, heaviness, and incomprehensible technicality of their performance. But the true epiphany came when they played the second track off this album: 'New Millennium Cyanide Christ'. It was at THAT MOMENT, when that first massive tech riff came in, that I knew that metal was my future. There was just some switch that clicked when I heard that song, one of the classics of the Meshuggah pantheon, being played. For months after seeing them, I downloaded Meshuggah MP3s essentially nonstop, but then discovering other artists as well: Morbid Angel, Gorgoroth, all the other extreme metal bands that quickly grabbed me. So on the strength of that song alone, this album easily holds a certain place in my heart and always will.\n\nThat being said, now that I'm more well versed in Meshuggah and metal in general, this is probably their weakest album. Due to the new single-mindedness of the compositions, you can easily describe the music here as being extremely brutal and technical, but also extremely repetitive and laced with a lot of filler. There are many memorable sections, but they aren't memorable in a particularly positive or negative way: a specific rhythm/riff pattern just gets caught in your head for no reason in particular. 'New Millenium Cyanide Christ' is the obvious masterpiece of the album: the riffs are positively crushing, the rhythms are deeply complex, but most importantly, the songwriting is some of the finest in Meshuggah's extensive catalog. It's perhaps the most flawless example of Meshuggah's militaristic might: sections of two time signatures, one common time and another one of Tomas Haake's bizarre bass drum configurations, interweave for long sections of musical space, diving in and out of rhythm, before a half second of silence occurs at the end of the stretch, at which point each band member simultaneously piledrives the music back into action with a collective roar. Additionally, the lyrics are some of the best in Meshuggah's history; I remember poring over them when I was younger, in absolute wonder of something so brutal, fantastical, and intricately crafted.\n\n'Concatenation' is a pretty vicious opener with its flurries of atonal chords, and 'Corridor Of Chameleons' is pretty good all around; additionally, 'Neurotica' has some of the best vocal lines I've heard in Meshuggah's discography. But after the cool first half, the album really fizzles out with another four songs that really don't do anything but qualify as pretty generic Meshuggah tracks. Granted, having fifty percent very good tracks is significantly more than most bands are able to do, but considering that this is Meshuggah, it results in a weaker album that would probably be better as an EP composed of the first four tracks. That being said, I do love it; all the songs on it are ones that I heard when I was younger and when everything in metal was completely novel to me. But objectively? No, this is probably the least essential release by Meshuggah, despite the opinions of many of those who are already fans. It's certainly worth a buy for those who love the Swedes' style, but for the average metalhead, the previous release is much more promising.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah is not an artist whose style changes with every album like Sigh, nor do they exist in a completely static artistic realm like Bolt Thrower. In each sequential album there is a change; albeit one a great deal more subtle than in most artists. Play any two Meshuggah albums side-by-side and you'll likely only first hear the erratic, piledriving guitar chugs and barking vocals, and probably for the few listens after that. And there are people that find great joy merely in those barest of techniques that the band uses, merely enjoying the odd time signatured pummeling that the band delights in. To those who listen a bit more closely, or to those more versed in the band's music, however, more details are collected: the delicate shifts of mood, texture or atmosphere, the subtle, polyrhythmic dance, where instruments play along out of time for some strange number of measures before falling like a perfect hammer into the lockstep rhythm of the section's beginning. But on that fall, there might be something new; a change in cymbal, a minimalist, sinuous lead, a few extra scattered beats placed ever so precisely in the morass of thick, monstrously stormy riffs. And it is indeed a set of features and emphases that many simply cannot appreciate: these are merely not factors that a large number of people can truly find enjoyable. But for those that do love the machinelike assault of this artist, there's not one that does the style better.\n\n'Destroy Erase Improve' is, at least in my estimation, Meshuggah's greatest work. On their earliest works, Meshuggah had resembled an extremely developed, apocalyptic form of thrash metal; after this album, on 'Chaosphere', the technical and industrial elements of the band came to dominate their style, essentially completely excising any of their identifiable thrash metal past. The material on 'Destroy Erase Improve', however, forms the bridge between their two styles, with more of the traditional song structures and identifiably melodic riffs of thrash as well as the extremely technical aspects of their later works, and this marriage creates their best release, being both satisfyingly experimental and technical as well as grounded in perceptible song structures. Consider it the Meshuggah equivalent of Gorguts' 'From Wisdom To Hate', though unlike that album, Meshuggah's second LP can't be viewed as any sort of concession to the audience.\n\nThe opener of this album shows why it's so crucial in Meshuggah's discography: 'Future Breed Machine', arguably THE Meshuggah song, is not only the band's perpetual closer to every live set, but practically the band's definitive musical mission statement. It is easily one of the finest songs the band has ever written, with each section being memorable despite the almost quintessentially unmemorable style that Meshuggah plays, at least to those more unfamiliar with the intricacies of their style. From the grinding machine-sound intro to the sudden burst of strobing searchlight lead over traditional Meshuggah mechanical devastation, then suddenly moving into a sudden post-thrash riff before the vocals begin, every second is completely memorable and completely perfectly designed. There are numerous high points beyond it, the most obvious of them all, though. 'Soul Burn' is a personal favorite, with its high-speed delivery and staggered, doubletracked vocal lines. 'Terminal Illusions' is possibly the most straightforward and aggressive track on the album, also notable for its surprisingly direct anti-religious theme as opposed to Meshuggah's typically abstract meditations.\n\nThe very best on the album, however, would be 'Suffer In Truth', a track that's slower pace and pounding, martial performances create an even more ominous than normal atmosphere, especially when combined with its air-siren leads that circle ominously above the battlefield below like so many choppers. Experimentation is, as stated before, very readily present: mellow ambient instrumental 'Acrid Placidity' forms a well-placed intermission between two of the most aggressive tracks on the album. But the most obviously atypical track is probably closer 'Sublevels', which eschews most of the typical chug in favor of a more subtle, slowly descending fusion-influenced track, with drums, quiet guitar and spoken word vocals forming the body between occasional bursts of ferocious grinding.\n\nSome criticism could be leveled at perceived filler: 'Vanished' or 'Inside What's Within Behind' probably aren't as strictly necessary as the other tracks on the album, but I'd say they help establish a more solid bedrock for the music to build upon, with the more unique tracks building off the more 'standard' ones. No, 'Destroy Erase Improve' does not have the absolutely single-minded focus of essentially all of Meshuggah's other albums, but it is all the better for it: this is easily the most varied of all their albums, and also the one with the most unique songs, as opposed to later releases which generally feature about half excellence and half album expanders. And to be honest, the music here is simply a great deal more memorable than on most other Meshuggah CDs, with enough of their thrash roots to give the songs a more cohesive yet varied structure but still maintain the distinctive musical flavor of the band. If any Meshuggah album was to be described as 'essential', it would probably be this one, even for those who typically dislike the band.\n\nFun fact: A live version of 'Suffer In Truth' is what encouraged me to pick up drumming.\n",
        "\nLife is but chaos, a swirling vortex of sequences and events yet to unfold... however there are few certainties that are readily apparent; \n\n- The pokemon franchise will never die until it has consumed our souls\n- I will never get to sleep at a reasonable time unless I pass out\n- Meshuggah will keep getting praise as long as they play in obscenely ridiculous time signatures despite not writing any discernible riffs.\n\nMaybe I'm too uncultured; just tonight I was drinking large quantities of very cheap beer (rather affectionately referred to as 'wifebashers' in this country) on a patch of grass as part of an event for a faculty I don't even belong to. I was aiming to have my liver rupture violently, instead I'm writing a review at 4 in the morning, and clearly something went wrong. Regardless, metal isn't necessarily about being proletariat or sophisticated but in that same field of thought one really can't deny musicians the right to express themselves in whatever manner they wish. But enough of my mental wank; I hate Meshuggah, they are over-rated.\n\nIt's not their fault; they just do not impress me. Being able to play in utterly ludicrous time signatures that don't make the music sound like an abhorrent mess is surely something to give credit and praise but ultimately it's hollow. It's a gimmick, something shiny to distract the gullible whilst the band snort lines off the ass of a hooker. And of course like everything that comes along and is technical, the band are lauded as saviours of metal and possessing talents far beyond that contained within our mortal shells. If you don't like them you're a filthy Nazi who should be exiled to the 'Outback' and thus face off with an evil empire of koalas in a fight for their own survival. Of course this is pure hyperbole, although I have heard rumours that the Crocodile Kingdoms of the north are ready to strike since our national 'defender' is down and out.\n\nAdmittedly with this release Meshuggah at least retain some credibility maintaining a decent amount of speed for some tracks, of course this leads to their labeling as thrash metal. The problem is to be a thrash metal band you have to write riffs, and swinging at your guitar with a hammer at odd intervals does not constitute riffs (note the plural). Weird and varying time signatures are interesting, but when restricted to the confines of generic 'post-thrash' riffing it loses all substance and purpose. The solos are quite awkward, having an unusual tone and texture. Within the confines of this album they seem to work, they give off a cold and electronic feel which helps to contrast with the mechanical, chugging riffs. The album is the musical equivalent of a factory. Ultimately I dislike the riffing which means I think the solos are complete ass; they just don't go anywhere or do anything constructive. They sound all bleep-y and bloop-y, and when I have to use kindergarten language to describe music you're doing something wrong. Most importantly the album runs together all too easily; the rapid-fire, but at varying time signature chord bash gives little character to each song and even the solos within each song don't help to alleviate this debilitating hindrance. The only landmark within this album is track 6, mainly because it is devoid of any chugging riffs and is essentially an ambient piece. As soon as you get to track 6 you realise you've just wasted 24 minutes of your life and you have 3 minutes to decide if you wish to waste another 14 minutes. The rest of the instruments within the band serve their purpose effectively, of course they're all in wacky time signatures. Admittedly it's nice to have a band with a bass line that is audible for a decent length of time.\n\nTo actively listen to this music would be folly; honestly it is terrifyingly depressing to notice that you're only one metalcore step away from listening to a Lamb of God album and kids, that's one road no one wants to travel. It works well as background music, it also garners bonus points for making you look and feel tough when you play it really loud while driving.\n\nScore: 35% ~ boring boring boring. And they only get worse from here. Recommended if you're a fan of post-\"Cowboys from Hell\" Pantera, otherwise you need not apply\n",
        "\nHypocrisy - 45/50 \n\nRoswell 47 is one of the best songs to showcase the stylistic changes of T\u00e4gtgren's band in 1996. The song has about the same speed as the average \"The Fourth Dimension\" track, but features more audible melodic riffs and lead guitars.\n\nT\u00e4gtgren's vocal work is again excellent, he uses both mid-range growls and an extremely high-pitched scream (a trademark style of T\u00e4gtgren that started with the \"Abducted\" album) that manages to send chills down my spine. \n\nLars Sz\u00f6ke still wasn't an amazing drummer when this was released, but he does his job, without gaining too much attention. An average performance. \n\nOverall, a great song and a wise choice for a split single like this one. \n\nMeshuggah - 25/50\n\nThe early years of this band saw them playing technical thrash metal, somewhat comparable to a heavier Megadeth. The album \"Destroy Erase Improve\" showed a style that was quite different to their old sound, straying away from thrash metal almost completely. This split is one of the first signs of their changing sound.\n\nSadly, Meshuggah's part of this little split is also far less enjoyable. \"Future Breed Machine\" is an average song on an average album. It features the typical \"weird\" time signatures that Meshuggah have been uses for ages, as well as the downtuned, sludgy guitars that define Meshuggah's sound. I never really enjoyed their music much, and \"Future Breed Machine\" doesn't change that in the least. Their singer's hardcore shouting is not exactly enjoyable either. Not a bad song per se, but simply not my cup of tea. \n\nIf you like lots of different time signatures and monotone, arrhythmic riffing with hardcore vocals on top, this might be useful for you. \n\nOverall, this is a decent split for fans of Hypocrisy and Meshuggah, but not recommended to people new to these bands.\n",
        "\nIf there ever was an album that was unfairly thrown into obscurity, its 'Contradictions Collapse'. It's not perfect, but it still qualifies as a great metal album if not compared to the bands later catalouge. Meshuggah's signature style of mind-bending metal was not fully developed in their first LP (obviously) but it still does stand when compared to most other death metal acts at that time and is one good step musically better than most. It's what you would expect as a debut album from a band that are arguably at the top of their game now, even if it does not hold up to their other albums. It is still better than alot of other metal out their anyway.\n\nThe production on 'Contradictions' is clearly not superb, but it is still listenable and allows the music to be progressive. Everything is low quality but very easy to listen to and get into. The songs are very catchy and detailed, which even mediocre production can't ruin. It almost sounds like one knob or so got turned wrong and jerked the balance a little bit. The guitars feel a little bit left out and just too quiet, which brings the atmosphere of the album a little less intense then it could have been. The drum sound is a bit cheap and the snare is minimally annoying at times, but rarely. Aside from these set backs, the production doesn't leave anything completely out. The bass and vocals are very clear, and the production never truly distracts from the technical excellence of the album.\n\nThe metal on this album is very heavy, fast, technical and satisfying. The riffs are staccato and fly all over the place. The guitar does not sound like any thing else out there. There are dozens of strange time signatures and sudden tempo changes which catch interest. The guitars are thick as hell and sound like heavy, heavy rocks being thrown around. They puncture your ears if turned up to loud (thats a good thing). There are occasional acoustic parts, they do not sound glam or power-balladish. The clean parts abolish the staccato, but keep the strange time signatures. Overall the guitar riffs are generally short but provide alot for the album. The tempo often changes from rapid-fast to mid-range to slow. Sometimes it's not a great switch, but most of the time it works just fine.\n\nThe drums are just as interesting as the guitars, somehow. The performance of the man behind the set is just magnificent. The drums sound totally different than the guitars, but they still manage to fit the music near perfectly. They sound as if each last snare and cymbal are playing in different worlds, but they still. The drumming is hyper techincal, and is staccato like the guitar, with just as many tempo changes. In all honesty, Meshuggah have one of the most talented drummers in extreme metal. The drumming is so techincal, it's hard to air drum to. Seriously.\n\nThe vocals are standard fare, though. They sounds just like most other thrash bands out there, with a crunchy voice and the ocassional chanting quality to them. They are done generally well, the lead man was a good choice. The vocals are not prominent at all, the real focus is one the sonic guitar playing and blasting drums. The vocals are by no means terrible, but they are very easily forgotten. They don't offer very much to the album.\n\nI would recommend this album to anyone who likes techinal death metal, or progessive metal for that manner. I would not recommend this as your first Meshuggah album however, their future albums are certainly better. The flaws lie in the fact that the album is a little repedative. The songs are catchy and technical but are almost indistinguishable from one another. They may be a bit too technical in places, and leaves the listener not being able to remember too many riffs after the first few listens. That being said, it's still a good progressive metal album and is a solid debut for Meshuggah.\n",
        "\nI thought I'd give this album a try after being slightly disappointed by Destroy Erase Improve. Sure, that album is technical and thrashy, but it lacks a certain something- perhaps a cohesive quality. Meshuggah want to be Metallica one moment with catchy hook rhythms, and then Herbie Hancock on acid the next, mixing out-there jazz fusion guitar with technical thrash...or something. In any case, everybody knows that Meshuggah's main draw is their headbangability and serpentine time signatures, which DEI certainly possesses, but it still lacks a key element. Oh, right: brutality. It's heavy, I suppose, but more in an Atheist sense than, say, a Morbid Angel sense. \n\nChaosphere absolutely obliterates DEI on every level imaginable. Picture a faster, more confusing, more destructive version of that album without the lame jazz fusion guitar interludes and you'll have the essence of Chaosphere. The melody is decapitated right off the bat with Concatenation, a complete mindfuck of polythyhms. This is Future Breed Machine on steroids. There are no catchy, sing-along parts or introductions. Jens simply starts screaming so intensely you can just picture the veins in his forehead popping out. A nice, completely atonal solo from Frederik fills out the middle of the song, along with some great guitar melodies. Then, just as you're starting to understand everything, the music comes crashing down on your face like a brick wall and the song is over. \n\nThis is the essence of Chaosphere. Where DEI toyed with slightly normal minor and major intervals and melodies, this record inserts mind-warping, twisted guitar work that complements the band's sound far better. The atmosphere is intensified, the simplistic guitar riffs (any real Meshuggah fan will admit it: most of their songs have about 5 notes, not counting the solos) aren't as noticeable, and the vocals are pushed to the forefront when needed and into the backup mix when the focus is on the instruments. Haake's drumming is at once catchier and more memorable while being ten times more complex than anything he did on DEI. The polyrhythms lead places instead of just stagnating. All in all, it's a truly amped-up version of everything prior in Meshuggah's catalogue. Interestingly, this makes everything seem catchier as a result of more careful, precise organization, although it's noticeably more brutal.\n\nNew Millenium Cyanide Christ is definitely one of the most metal songs ever recorded. Written in 23/16 (if I'm not mistaken), it's by far the catchiest and greatest song Meshuggah has yet recorded (as far as DEI and, Selfcaged, and this go). Check this one out if you're \"on the fence\" about the band.\n\nCorridor of Chameleons, Neurotica, and The Mouth Licking What You've Bled are all great tracks, featuring more stellar guitar solos (which are thankfully much more frequent and better-orchestrated on this record) from Frederik and awesome riffs aplenty. Sane and The Exquisite Machinery of Torture aren't quite as good as the first five tracks, but are by no means boring, showing off some experimental sides that Meshuggah would later pursue on Catch Thirty-Three. Elastic is fifteen minutes long, yes, but only about five of it is the actual song (which slays mightily), the remaining ten being made up of distorted guitar feedback and all the other songs on the CD played in reverse at the same time. It's quite pleasant to listen to if you can get used to it, actually, and it's fun to try to pick out the songs. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a more progressive Meshuggah, pick up DEI. But if you want sheer brutality in a savage pack of metal insanity, don't pass this one up.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah have never been a favorite band of mine. I feel as though the band really gets involved with itself. This isn\u2019t always a bad thing \u2013 sometimes it works very well that a band writes for itself but Meshuggah take it a little far. \n\nCatch 33 (as the title suggests) is a risky album. Following in the footsteps of their EP \u201cI\u201d, Catch 33 is one song. This time though they had to courtesy to split the song into parts though for easy access to various parts of the song. Unfortunately many of the parts are almost EXACTLY the same as previous parts. So the various song titles and reasoning for the separation of the tracks seems random to me. \n\nThe guitars are once again heavy as fuck as with most Meshuggah albums. The 8 string guitars basically combine bass work into the guitar work and although at one point I found the sound interesting it soon loses its charm after 10 or so minutes. The music is focused on the rhythm and despite claims of \u201cprogressive\u201d nature it seems as though the music is more repetitive then most other forms of metal. The guitars do have that industrial overtone that I do have a tendency to like. Massive downbeats rule this album. There is some technicality to the guitars at times but since the guitars are so distortedly heavy it\u2019s lost in the sludge.\n\nThe bass work is overrun by the guitars. In all actuality I have no idea whether or not the bass lines even exist on this album. The drums are all programmed \u2013 and even though they are the most progressive and varied part of the album they still ring heavily of being programmed on a computer. This is the sound that Meshuggah was striving for I\u2019m sure (programmed drums are nothing new to Meshuggah). I am not a huge fan of that especially when there aren\u2019t instruments to fill in for that sound.\n\nVocally, Jens gives a normal performance so I can\u2019t say much about that. His deep throated and aggressive style is very unique and one can tell his voice within any song. The distortion on his voice does get old quickly and the lack of variation doesn\u2019t halp at all either. Lyrically is where Meshuggah shines their greatest. Their ability to craft simplistic yet very symbolic lyrics is clever. I wish they had more lyrics to read and decipher \u2013 and sometimes I wish there was chorus\u2019s on this album so that I could sing along with.\n\nIn the end the lyrics can\u2019t hold the album together and even though the album has a great flow (it IS one song) the album is repetitive and uninspired. Meshuggah have done better than this and hopefully with their next release head back towards that \u201ctechnical post-thrash\u201d they originally played.\n\nSongs to check out: \u2026um\u2026Catch 33?\n",
        "\nMeshuggah is one of those bands who get a crap-load of praise and a crap-load of criticism by metalheads. Meshuggah's second album, \"Destroy Erase Improve\" shows exactly what Meshuggah is about: Heavy, technical, robotic riffs, and inhuman barks and growls, with subtle, yet powerfully difficult, drumming.\n\nThis album created that formula, and it is their thrashiest album while still be insanely technical. From the start off song, \"Future Breed Machine\" to the last song \"Sublevels\" and the calm, jazzy interlude \"Acrid Placidity\" Meshuggah shows off its technical prowess. Metalheads claim that Meshuggah's songs all sound the same, while this may be true from some of the filler tracks on this album, FBM, Soul Burn, Acrid Placidity, Suffer in Truth, and Sublevels all stand out. \n\nAlthough the other tracks may be filler, they do not detract from the importance of this album. \"DEI\" is an album that cannot be copied, not even by Meshuggah themselves. It hits you in such a way that you find yourself saying, \"Wow, what did I just experience?\". Whether you like the album or not is a completely different story, but you cannot override its importance to the fledgling half-thrash scene.\n",
        "\nWithout a doubt, Meshuggah have come a long way. The straightforward thrash of Contradictions Collapse is long gone; the technical thrash of Destroy Erase Improve has been left behind; the speedy rhythmic permutations of Chaosphere have been all but abandoned. The plodding pace of Nothing has been taken and twisted into a far more severe animal. As for I... some people claim Catch Thirty-Three to be an extension of that album, but the two have almost nothing in common, musically.\n\nNow there's this. Forget progression from album to album... the real beauty here is progression within the album itself. The way it moves from start to finish is... compelling. The methodical nature of the compositions is more mechanical than anything they've done in the past. The thing is simply austere. Uncompromising, cold, emotionless, controlled chaos. \n\nTo be honest, those adjectives can easily be applied to past Meshuggah albums and still retain some degree of accuracy, but there's a sole element that's pervasive throughout Catch Thirty-Three that doesn't really exist on any other Meshuggah release - it's hypnotizing. It's an interesting thing... the album is very rhythmic and percussive, and the riffs that source from their (now) 8-string guitars are massive, deep, and deceptively repetitive. If you don't pay very close attention, you'd get the impression that the first three songs are entirely comprised of a single riff played monotonously over a simple drum progression - so untrue. The guitars and drums are in brilliant unison all over this album, and they are constantly twisting through myriad rhythmic permutations. I'm not huge on music theory, so forgive me if I misuse some terms, but I believe the rhythmic brilliance that Meshuggah have always embraced is on highest display here. That one riff that you thought was repeating itself over, and over, and over, and over for the last four minutes has actually been morphing, stretching, and collapsing over itself, starting again in a completely different position within the measure and eventually realigning itself within the big picture after a given number of repetitions, only to take off again on another rhythmic trip. Meshuggah does not use polyrhythms to throw the listener off, they instead opt to take the standard 4/4 time signature and completely fuck with your head by slicing up the metric subdivisions of a given progression into some really absurd patterns that sound repetitive, but in actuality are constantly shifting... and man, they exploit the hell out of this approach on Catch Thirty-Three. Hence, the hypnotizing nature of the beast.\n\nPeople like to bitch about the drums. They're programmed. So what? I didn't even know that they were programmed until I read about it on some forum a few months after I had purchased the album. They sound excellent - full of body, depth, and slam... the cymbals especially are great. Besides, I have full confidence in Tomas Haake's ability to play all of this material.\n\nJens Kidman is still roaring out his chaotic lyricism as usual with that unwavering atonality he's so well known for. The lyrics themselves seem fitting for the post-apocalyptic sentiment that the music tends to bring forth.\n\nIn the end, I'm tempted to say that this is Meshuggah's best album. They've completely buried themselves into the rhythmic trickery that in the past has only been used as a groundwork for other musical elements, and they're really fucking good at it. We don't get to hear Fredrik's oh so sweet Allan Holdsworth-plugged-into-the-Matrix solo'ing, nor do we get to experience Haake's inhuman accuracy on their speedier material... but in exchange we get something far more cerebral; something that's heavy and crushing, yet entrancing, sublime, and minimalistic... something that's satisfying on entirely different level.\n\nMeshuggah is no longer the quintessential technical metal band. They have evolved into something far, far greater.\n",
        "\n\"Nothing\" is Meshuggah's forth offering. Released in 2002 on Nuclear Blast, this is one hell of a heavy album. Considering the band's name translated into English means \"Crazy\", one can say that the band's name is very apt. \n\nPrimarily i am a Black Metal fan, so venturing to this side of the Metal genre made me feel slightly apprehensive, if not a little nervous at what i might come across. This was actually the first Meshuggah album that i had the chance to listen to. Meshuggah were highly recommended to me when i was younger by fellow Metal lovers, so naturally, i wanted to be open minded and give it a try. \n\nMeshuggah certainly are talented, there is no doubt about that. Creating a very unusual type of music which appears to have elements of many different genres all thrown into one. Jazz, Thrash, and various other forms of Metal are all fused together in a brutal, harsh and extremely technical manner. Being a Black Metal fan means i'm more accustomed to simplicity and creation of music through sheer emotion and atmosphere, so i was a little out of my depth when i listened to \"Nothing\". However, after a certain period of time the music Meshuggah create becomes more accessible to the listener, it just requires a lot of patience. To me, technicalities don't make good music. They just cover up the faults of a band, which is sadly what happens in Meshuggah's case. As with previous albums, songwriting is a problem. There are far too many generic tracks. It doesn't make any sense. How can a band go from creating \"Perpetual Black Second\" to creating something like \"Organic Shadows\"? It makes no sense. Also, however technical Meshuggah are in parts, they have a habit of repeating chords time and time again. Bass is often indistinguishable from the rest of the music. The drums are too overbearing. The vocals are fine in parts, but in tracks like \"Organic Shadows\" they shift to something which can only be described as a man with constipation. \n\nFor all it's bad points Meshuggah do hold some positives. The production is crystal clear. A small proportion of songs are creative, innovative and extremely catchy. The vocals can often be quite fitting, though at points quite disappointing. They're brutal and portray a sheer hatred. The music itself depicts the lyrical themes quite well, in my opinion. You can see the intent ... It certainly sounds futuristic and chaotic. One cannot help but admire the ability and potential this band has. \n\nHighlights include Rational Gaze, the excellent Perpetual Black Second and Closed Eye Visuals.\n",
        "\nPretty much everyone reading this will be familiar with 2002's planet smashing monster \"Nothing\". Well if you liked that, you'll like this, and if you didn't like that then you won't like this. That's not to say that this is Nothing Part 2 by any means, in fact this is a completely different kettle of fish altogether. The staccato churning grooves of Nothing are here, but they're even slower, more repetitive and set to even more mind-boggling time signatures. This 47 minute monster of a song never gets boring, and the only reason I didn't give this album a perfect score, is, well, that vocoder in Mind's Mirrors is just a tad cheesy. The album highlight would of course be the \"In Death\" songs, and the awesomely creepy little ambient part at the end, which goes screaming straight into the staccato tribalism of \"Shed\". \n\nJens is on top form as always on the vocals, barking out lyrics in his trademark \"veins popping out on head, red in the face, drill sergeant\" fashion. Another small complaint would be we don't see enough of Fred's crazy insectoid jazz fusion solos, but damn those rhythms make up for it! \n\nIt's a shame Haake doesn't play drums, but you'd never know the drums weren't real, seeing as they've all been sampled from his ungodly kit. Apparently the riffs were being chopped and changed around all the time and it would of taken forever to keep learning the drum parts, so fair play to them.\n\nAnd damn! That cold industrial tremolo riffing which keeps popping up under all these massive riffs makes my hairs stand up! This whole album just makes me think of the inner workings of a massive sentient machine, calculating our demise with a cold unemotional mind. Even though the lyrics are about paradoxes. Speaking of lyrical content, its awesome as usual, even if I don't have a clue what they're on about most of the time. Actually make that ALL the time. These lyrics are pretty damn esoteric, although they are a lot of fun to read and make a feeble attempt at understanding.\n\nSo all in all, I'd say this isn't quite Meshuggah's best, although its certainly worthy of a place in their discography. According to them, its not even a bona-fide album, and an experimental piece instead. If you have an open mind and are patient, then buy this album! You (probably) won't regret it!\n",
        "\nThis album is one that is loved or loathed, without many indifferent opinions\u2026even from Meshuggah fans. I am in the loved category, and do firmly believe this is the best album ever.\n\nI think what makes this album so good is its flow from section to section. The whole album feels like a complete journey, a trek, until you finally reach the finish line. But instead of feeling exhausted, you will want to go back and do it all over again. The journey is just that good.\n\nDon\u2019t expect anything intricate in this album, because you will be disappointed, as some have been. This is definitely a step in a slightly off-centre direction for Meshuggah. The guitar riffs themselves are still the same polyrhythmic frenzy they have been creating for the bulk of their career, but they have been mostly simplified. However, this fact doesn\u2019t make it bad\u2026not at all. They were going more for flow than technicality, and this album delivers that in bucketloads. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that the guitar riffs themselves are bad. \u201cThe Paradoxical Spiral\u201d is very good, especially after the vocals end. The guitar and drum duo keep the song on its feet the whole time. Sections of \u201cIn Death \u2013 Is Death\u201d continue the excellent guitar work. However, every riff is just a taster for the final riff found in \u201cSum.\u201d At 1:08 begins the best riff Meshuggah have ever created, and is an excellent closer to this magnificent album. I would\u2019ve loved to see it go on for a little longer, but they give you just enough to go back \u2013 I can only compare it to a fast-food place giving you a cup of French fries, but they give you just not enough, so you have to go back and buy some more. While that scenario is annoying and expensive, it is not so here. They do it perfectly.\n\nThe drumming is also simplified, but it is a drum machine here, and yet you probably wouldn\u2019t know it by hearing it. While they are not quite as technical as other albums, they fit the style here with ease. They follow on with the flow of the album, rather than the intricacy.\n\nThe vocals are what you would hear on other Meshuggah albums, but they are always good. I have always considered Jens Kidman an excellent vocalist, but it\u2019s actually the lyrics where they shine brightest. Every word bleeds creativity and originality, and more bands need to follow this example. This is the high point of Meshuggah\u2019s lyrical life so far, and they can easily surpass this (they didn\u2019t quite do that on ObZen, but the lyrics there are still great).\n\nSo, with all that in mind, it probably does sound like a bad album. And to some, it is, and that is justifiable. But for those who appreciate what it\u2019s all about, then this is some of the best, flowing music you will ever hear. The lyrics, the riffs, the ambient sections, the seamlessness\u2026brilliant. All of it.\n\nBest tracks: The Paradoxical Spiral, Entrapment, Mind\u2019s Mirrors, In Death \u2013 Is Death, Sum\n",
        "\nImagine sitting in your living room, quietly reading a book. The sun is shining, the birds are tweeting. Then KABOOM!! An explosion in the front yard knocks you out of your seat. The windows smash. People are screaming in terror. Disorder and panic ensue.\n\nThis is akin to starting Meshuggah's 1998 release \"Chaosphere\". No introduction, no warning, just straight into the unrelenting, brutal music.\n\nMany fans (and haters) believe that \"Destroy Erase Improve\" was the start of this band becoming popular. While it was a good album, in terms of brutality and catchiness, however, \"Chaosphere\" shits all over it. This, for me, was the start of Meshuggah's excellence.\n\nThe usual jazz intermissions and melodies are nowhere to be found here. Instead, it is dominated by ultra-crunchy guitars and pin-point drumming, never relenting to give you breath. From start to finish, all the instruments just pummel you until you're a bleeding wreck.\n\nThe guitar work really gives this album it's heavy edge, surpassing DEI in all facets of playing. It's crunchier, faster, and the riffs are more thought out and played much tighter.\n\nThe very best example of the quality of riffing is at 0:13 into \"The Mouth Licking What You've Bled\". At first listen, it sounds like just a plodding riff which doesn't really go anywhere. Repeated, and deeper, listens will reveal that the secret to this riff being as spectacular as it is is the drummer. He's keeping the 4/4 rhythm with the hi-hat, but he's doing something else (7/8, maybe?) with the snare drum. I have tried, and repeatedly failed, to replicate it. He is a master.\n\nThe strangest thing about this album is easily the outro on \"Elastic\". At 4:13, the song riff suddenly changes, turning into single hit drum-guitar pieces, with atmospheric guitars in the background. Then, at around the 6:00 mark, a weird reverberation sound comes in, getting louder and louder until your eardrums nearly burst. Then that finishes at 11:18, with the first three tracks being played at the same time, and then it suddenly ends at 15:30. Definitely a strange way to end the album, however it seems almost fitting to the music. Not for the faint hearted (or hearing sensitive!).\n\nThere are plenty of catchy riffs throughout the album, and it would take forever to list them all here, but guaranteed, this album will never get boring, as the endless polyrhythms will keep you guessing and coming back to refresh what you just heard.\n\nSo, is this their heaviest album? Definitely.\n\nIs this their best album? Well, no. While it's the catchiest, 2002's \"Nothing\" does surpass this.\n\nWill Meshuggah ever create another album that recaptures the intensity of \"Chaosphere\"? Who knows. Hopefully.\n\nAll I do know that if you're a fan of intense, insane, and completely off-kilter music, this has to be in your collection.\n\nBest tracks: New Millennium Cyanide Christ, The Mouth Licking What You've Bled, The Exquisite Machinery Of Torture.\n",
        "\nThis was probably the first Meshuggah release I listened to; I discovered it at the same time as their later album Catch 33. There was an article in the local newspaper (Meshuggah hail from Ume\u00e5, where I live) about the band and their upcoming Catch 33. The article mentioned their \"math metal\" style and that Catch 33 would be one single, continuous 47 minute song, and also that this was not new for them, which of course, was referring to the 2004 EP I. At the time, I did not listen to extreme metal, I was, so to speak, a real metal newbie, but I had always enjoyed the more complex and longer songs, such as Iron Maiden's Rime of the Ancient Mariner and appreciated the song-writing skills involved in such compositions. (Incidentally, listening to Meshuggah would lead me to discover Opeth, who certainly meet these criteria) This, coupled with my fascination for mathematics, made Meshuggah seem like a band worth checking out. And it was definitely worth it.\n\nBeing 21 minutes long, I cannot go into a full description of the song, but I will try to give an overview.\n\nI begins with a chugging down-tuned guitar (only slightly above the standard tuning of a bass guitar) playing a single note and a constant beating of a tom. But is it repetitive? Not at all. The strange rhythms and time signatures will prompt you to find patterns, which is not very easy. This lasts one and a half minute, after which Jens Kidman unleashes an unearthly 30 second scream. The song continues with staccato riffs and very heavy percussion, then one of Thordendal's solos.\n\nThe next section is one of the highlights of the record. The drumming and the rhythm here are, to put it mildly, insane. Despite the seeming madness, it is a really catchy part and one of my favorites. Definitely a headbanging-friendly section.\n\nAnd so it continues. Verses, all with Jens' guttural singing, bordering on death metal growling, but different, staccato riffs, lighting fast, clean Thordendal solos and Haake's manic drums, all . The heaviness is very hard to express with words; it must be experienced. So is the skill of these musicians.\n\nSome other killer moments include the riff around halfway through the song and the solo at 12:40. This riff is most likely best described as the musical equivalent of being hit by an eighteen-wheeler at maximum speed. The outro riff is amazing as well. It's a crushing, rolling riff that spells imminent doom and destruction. Again, a very headbanging-friendly section, especially during the last three lines, which feature a riff similar to the eighteen-wheeler riff.\n\nWhile the length of the only song on this record is extreme, it is by no means repetitive. There are no boring or bad sections, except for two brief interludes, the disc is wholly composed of the aforementioned killer riffs and insane drum patterns. Its length also adds to the value of listening to it a second time: often, one finds new things one had not noted before. \n\nI is a must-have for any metalhead.\n",
        "\nQuite a few bands lately have been of the mind that taking a single, meandering, horrendously long song and making an entire album out of it is a great and novel idea. Unfortunately, most of the time what you get is a crawling exercise in patience and a burning desire for the album in question to be re-arranged into a condensed, 5-minute endurable version of what you just had to sit through (read: Green Carnation). Sometimes, though, a group of guys get together who have so many ideas running through their heads that a single-song album becomes not only a great idea, but a vessel for ultimate expression.\n\nThis is such an album. In its simplest form, I is a 21 minute summary of everything that Meshuggah has done prior. The high-speed staccato thrashing; the calculated rhythmic irregularities; the eerie stretches of ambience; the swirling, alien guitar leads; the atonal roaring and paradoxical, destructive lyricism - it's all here. However, it's all tied together by a menacing atmosphere of utter devastation that makes even the creeping onslaught of Nothing seem tame in comparison. Whether the unwavering and machine-like rolling tom patterns that constitute the hypnotizing introduction, the absolutely crushing breakdown of roaring guitars and time-shattering drums that occurs at around the 3:30 mark, Fredrik Thordendal's mechanical assault at 5:40 which consists of an incessant flurry of notes backed by an unadulterated display of inhuman endurance and accuracy from drummer Tomas Haake, the disturbing reverberations of oddly conflicting notes that mark the transition from the chaotic permutations that came before to the massive soundscapes that will follow, the heavy-as-fuck riffing that comes in at the 10:30 mark which encompasses what's probably the only moment in this entire song that you'll be able to effectively headbang to without getting confused, the diabolical whispering of Jens Kidman at 12:00 and the hive-like guitar lead from Fredrik that soon follows, the slow pulsing of dark arpeggios that steadily builds into a Nothing-era displaced pattern of shifting drums and twisted guitars at 17:00, or the standard Meshuggah-esque rhythmic motif that slowly coalesces into a lengthy stretch of foreboding feedback that closes out the song - the only word to properly describe this is... monolithic. Without the respite of track breaks, this becomes an unstoppable machine bent on the complete annihilation of everything in its path.\n\nI is a tremendous achievement in Meshuggah's career and in the world of metal. While there are albums out there that are louder, heavier, and more extreme, none of them come close to exhibiting the cerebral and uncompromising nature of the music found here. The only album that does manage to sort of come close is Meshuggah's own follow-up, Catch Thirty-Three, but even that has more of a post-apocalyptic feel than the malevolent destruction found on I.\n\nAbsolutely mammoth music.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah has always been a controversial metal band. Some have accused them of focusing too much on creating something new to even bother making sure that the old parts they employ are next to flawless. Others, however, state that Meshuggah's creativity is a blessing to metal, and that it may very well change metal for the better. After all, countless musicians list Meshuggah as an influence, regardless of genre. Personally, I am part of the latter party, and I think that \"Catch Thirty Three\" may very well be one of the most creative and brilliant albums ever made. \n\nI recall that many attacked this album (and many other Meshuggah albums) as simply only having various songs that all feature almost the exact same riffs each time. And though that's true (given this is all one 47-minute long song divided into 13 sections of various lengths), what they are able to create with one single riff is amazing. \n\nTheir style of making music is creative, in that many songs are recorded with each instrumentalist playing something in a different time signature. This sort of experimentation truly pays off in the long run, as it leaves listeners scratching their heads and wondering just exactly what they heard. A Meshuggah song is recognizable almost from the get-go, with their songs commonly featuring odd time signatures, aggressive drumming and guitar playing, and the signature brutal vocals from Jens Kidman. And this entire song employs the creative lengths Meshuggah is known for, grabbing the listener the moment they hit the play button.\n\nThe band also experimented with slower ambient pieces, and these help to transition the listener from part to part, giving them a much needed break from the familiar riff that dominates the main theme of the song. This riff is edited in various ways throughout the 47-minute long runtime, but it's very easy to listen to throughout the whole thing. The lyrics are quite enigmatic, and I heavily doubt anyone but the members of the band knows exactly what they mean. And yet this just adds to their mysterious allurance.\n\nTrue, Meshuggah is not for everyone. I know of many people who have listened to them before and dismissed them for being too \"odd.\" But if one has the patience and open-mindedness to listen to Meshuggah, then this album is clearly the place to start. It was the first album of theirs I listened to, and at first I truly did not know what to think. But after relistening to it a few times, I saw the genius in their work. Is it flawed? Of course, everything ever made is flawed (here, in particular, the repetition can get a bit tedious). But is it still a fantastic experience from start to finish? Yes. And it's worth every second.\n",
        "\nFirst of all, let me just say that I really, really wanted to like this album. I'm familiar with the way Meshuggah's claim to fame is the way they can absolutely obliterate time signitures/structure/etc, and while the idea of an album consisting of one single continuous song sounds a little like a gimmick to me, I was still interested to hear it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this disk is as impressive as hell musically, and anyone who thinks otherwise should listen to it again. The \"song\" immediately goes right into the main musical thread that pretty much carries through the entire 47 minutes; an irregular stop-start, choppy dischordant rhythm that then gets molded and mashed through a whole bunch of different melodic and rhythmic variations as the song progresses.\n\nOverall, though, while I do appreciate the complexity and originality that this band has to offer, I really don't find this release to be particularly listenable. I really like a lot of the riffs and individual moments, they just don't hold up for as long as they get dragged out. There are particular moments, in fact, like in the last minute of \"Entrapment,\" where the song definitely sounds like it hits a rut, and just sort of hangs around going absolutely nowhere for minutes at a time. This sort of thing, along with some stretches of \"filler\" (like the last 4-5 minutes of closer \"Sum\"), say to me that it doesn't really have to be this long.\n\nAll in all, if you took this song, compacted it down to about 10-15 minutes long, and made it the last track on a more diverse album, then you'd have yourself one HELL of a closer, and it would easily be one of my all time favorite songs. But as much as I love progressive metal, this one ends up being something I really respect, but don't really enjoy listening to.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah is simply in a class by themselves. They approach their songwriting from a purely artistic standpoint, paying no heed to bouandries and generalizations. This approach works wonderfully for the band on the group's latest effort \"Catch Thirtythree.\" \n\nCertainly, Meshuggah are not for everyobody. It's necessary to be able to appreciate broader ideas in music than the standard verse chorus verse fare that so often rears it's sometimes ugly head. The music of Meshaggah is a maze-like process, whether the group is slamming through bottom heavy musical math exercises or engaging in tonal experimentations in resonation. You'll also find more about this group that deviates from the norm other than heir abstract tonal qualities. The band completely throws out the three minute thirty second songwriting patterns that make it so easy for some listeners to follow the action. On the first three songs, \"Autonomy Lost\", \"Imprint Of The Unsaved\" and \"Disenchantment\" you'll find each being very similar one- minute pieces of the same musical puzzle, only Mesuggah drifts about a touch here and there, if you're listening closely. \n\nA buzzing guitar riff winds out the third cut and introduces the fourth as the group launches into the disjointed, mid-tempoed \"The Paradoxial Spiral\", a track that imparts a feeling of detuned vertigo. As the group morphs between Voivod themed spaciness and algebratic trippiness. The space adventure continues into \"Mind's Mirrors\", a sci-fi flavored intermission that finds Mesuggah providing a cosmic canvass that makes things all the more interesting when the group re-launch into the syrupy \"In Death - Is Life\". This two minute piece is intended to be a relavant counterpart to the following track, the \"In Life - Is Death\", a thirteen minute plus exercise in surrealistic thought provocation. \n\nFor those out there that would call Meshuggah boring, you're not listening to the same record or you're simply not listening at all. For metalheads that are craving departure from trends, patterns and standards, \"Catch Thirtythree\" will leave you with exactly that which you are seeking. Enigmatticaly original, Meshuggah are original without question and certainly, one of the most potent forces in all of the world of metal.\n",
        "\nMESHUGGAH - \"CATCH 33\", 2005\n\nMeshuggah is either hated or loved, there is no middle. Since their last album, the slurry and mechanical \"NOTHING\" (2002), the fans that praised the Chaosphere-ish era were divided with the new material. The slowness of it was too much for some; to others, it was repetitive; to the rest (and that includes me) it appeared to be one masterpiece, product of true evolution. The screw was turned again with \"I\", with which the band recovered some of its thrashy tempos and the (I think) unanymous approval. In this EP, the band featured a lot of diverse material, changing at a blinding speed. Nonetheless, they declared that this 21-minute-long track predicted nothing from their coming album. Oh my goodness, should I have listened to what they were saying. \n\nTruth be told, when I heard \"NOTHING\" I said: \"This guys can't get any difficult, both in understanding and in withstanding\" It required some time to get my ears used to the drilling of their masterminded chaos. The lyrical content itself was a severe challenge. All in all there were a lot of subtleties in this album and that's why it's definitely not boring (against popular beliefs) The polyrhythmic patterns is something you will surely encounter if you are new to this band. So, the band has been apparently striving to worship the pure form, the polyrhythm in its naked state, so the riff is not as important as the pattern itself, taking away the melody of it. The result is hard to swallow. Meshuggah is a band of prodigious musicians, their skill is unquestionable. But if you didn't like \"NOTHING\", you'll most probably abhor \"Catch 33\". I must tell you that right now. \n\nI don't know how to express an opinion about this album. Hell, I've heard it lotsa times and I don't even know how to pierce its mystery. At first I found myself speechless. What I supposed at the first moment after listening it was that the Meshuggah guys were upset about the \"NOTHING\" negative reviews and this record was their vengeance upon those who wrote them. Surprisingly enough, and even though it develops a slower, more uniform style than anything they have ever released, \"Catch 33\" is not boring. If you thought \"NOTHING\" couldn't get any plainer and simpler, well, try again. Of course, the rhythm is as complex (perhaps even more) as in the past. But, just to remind you, there was some melody crevice in the solos of previous efforts. Well, none of that anymore. I counted just one guitar solo in this album and it's cacophonic. There is also some catchiness in \"I\". Not anymore. And it's not just \"un\"catchiness, most of the music is at first plainly ungraspable. This is a redefinition of their experimental thrashy industrial metal and one cannot mistake it for an easily listenable album.\n\nThere are some \"illusions\" in this 47-minute epic monster. Since the beginning, the hypnotic pattern seems uniform and unchanging, giving you an impression of continuity, which, as you discover after a few listens, is not quite there. Because of this, the unstoppable song's development is a lot more \"organic\" than the \"I\" track. Since the song is mostly devoid of melody as we know it, it's quite difficult to remember specifically every turn, except the most memorable (you will remember afterwards the \"Mind's mirrors\" part). Now, like I've been saying, the rhytms are insanely complicated under the deceiving surface. The simplicity/complexity achieved by Meshuggah is unbelievable and the best example is the jumpy, jazzy part in \"In Death - Is Death\" (at around minute 5:00) which becomes a vicious riff accompanied by the other ominous guitar in the background. I don't know how they pieced together the whole track, but it definitely sounds as a unity. Far harder, I don't know how they could make something as apparently minimalistic and yet as complex. \n\nThe production is perfect, just the opposite to \"NOTHING\". The bass sounds clearer and more thunderous than ever and it has some lead parts, even though the 8-strings guitar must have had to eclipse it (the fact is, they both sound crushing) By the way, the guitar sounds excellent. The band had already announced that this was more guitar-based. They didn't mean the solos, they meant the chaotic orchestra of riffs. They proved their skill not by doing solos, but by displaying an internal timing that is beyond human capability. The general mood is erratic and slurry. The voice performs some good rhythmic growling or screeching passages, displaying, at least the way I hear it, a greater lung capacity (you have to hear Jens screaming the initial lyrics of \"In Death - Is Death\") than in previous material. In some of the final tracks, which perform violent and saturated passages, we find some vocalic surprises, similar to the biblical scream of Maynard James Keenan in \"The Grudge\". I am not sure wether Jens does it or if it's an effect but it certainly is a spectacular climax (\"Dehumanization\"'s gotta be the most effectively brutal track on \"Catch 33\"). About the much-discussed issue of the programmed drumming, it's true, Tomas didn't record them live, but you won't even notice. You have to consider this is one experiment and they felt no need of doing it live. Anyway, the drumming sounds realistic enough. You'll hear shit about it, but the drumming will be the least of the problems if you listen and try to understand this album.\n\nA probable reason for some Meshuggah fans to immediatly throw this CD to the garbage disposal is the slowness, the uniformity but also the arid musical landscapes which are provided by some interludes, such as \"Mind's Mirrors\", the ending of \"In Death - Is Death\" (where the guitars sound as a distant, irregular chiming) or the finale of the album. I personally didn't found them annoying, because the mind reels and staggers, and not just because of the music, which is slow but showing an impressive progression, but also because of the lyrics. This wouldn't be a Meshuggah release if the theme were simple. The whole package is what you get from this album and it was what you got also from \"NOTHING\", something that most of the fans forgot. Their metaphysical speculations are mind-blowing, things that mess up with your head. Ultimately, the lyrics DO relate to the musical concept, just the way they did in \"NOTHING\". The \"repetition\" of the first tracks, the interlude with the mechanical voice and the changes performed in the second half of the album, which is clearly more \"varied\" than the first, they all find an explanation in the lyrics (I won't even try to explain the concept, it would take ages)\n\nWell, I'll tell you what. I'll give this album the best rating; my bet is, this 2005's best. Why? will you wonder. Because it's impressive, it can be listened over and over. Because what produces great metal is not complexity but contundency and \"Catch 33\" scores high in contundency, it will force its way to your brain (do not be misled, \"Catch 33\" is complex indeed, it could be one of the most elaborate thematic album of the recent decades). Because this band surpassed itself, sacrificing popularity and ignoring the regular fans, throwing away the possibility of making a whole new concert set (which was already difficult by the time of \"NOTHING\" and plainly impossible with \"I\", but don't worry, they said a full-lenght is on the way); all this in order to produce an experimental album. I don't know if this is math-metal or what. Meshuggah can be qualified as \"extreme\" and \"experimental\" not because of its speed, but because of its purpose of cacophony and the conceptual theme that go with it. This is Armageddon in abstract, hermetic, mechanical, state-of-the-art terms, both in music and in language. I give \"Catch 33\" the best rating even though it will not appeal to you all. You can only get a warning through this review. I know such an album could end up sounding tiresome for a regular metal fan and I know there is something missing in Meshuggah that pisses their former fans off: they haven't recorded something straightforward and brutal since \"Chaosphere\"; their last three releases (\"NOTHING\", \"I\", \"Catch 33\") have been experiments, prodding at their own capacities, warming up, proving their talents, and, I would dare to say, defining solidly their style, but I'll tell you this, and mark my words: when they decide to flex all their muscles at a time, and I suppose that will happen with their next full-lenght, beware. This is a sophisticated and intelligent band to be reckoned with.\n",
        "\nThis is perhaps Meshuggah's best release. Now, I love their later releases, but they do tend to descend into a barrage of montonous riffing (with the possible exception of 'I'), and of course with Contradictions Collapse, they hadn't quite found their distinctive sound. This has all the things you would attribute to Meshuggah: the downtuned polyrhythmic riffing, excellent drumming keeping everything tight as hell, and the cold, emotionless and machine-like shouting of Jens Kidman and hushed spoken whispers of Thomas Haake.\n\n\nBut this seems to have more depth than their other releases. Why? Because this has some of the most hauntingly beautiful melodic passages I have heard for a long time. I started with the Chaosphere release so I was actually quite pleasantly shocked when I first head these short but essential passages. They're not so much a breather from the aggressive parts (which they are) but more of a development of the song as a whole. It's these passages that makes this the best Meshuggah release so far (the next being 'I' for the same reasons and it's bold experimentation). Okay, it makes them more listenable to people, but is this a bad thing? I'm all for an all-out sonic assault but this has so much more class.\n\n\nWith the almost unique polyrhythmic barrage of technical drum work, the crushing riffs (simplistic yet effective) and also these wonderful, sweeping melodic parts, it's the most complete of all their releases. I am left fully satisfied after listening to this particular album, something that I very rarely find when listening to a lot of other releases of this nature.\n\n\nI could ask for no more from this album.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah are a band that are constantly evolving. Whilst they may have started out with a lack of originality on the album \"Contradictions Collapse\" which owes more to thrash and speed metal, they have took the steps to evolve forward and create more memorable albums. I don't know if \"Catch 33\" will be their be all, end all masterpiece, as by the way they are going, the next album could top even this!\n\nFor those new to Meshuggah, this is music that is abstract and ahead of it's time. Perhaps the answer to keeping metal original is to keep pushing the boundaries and even embrace influences from non metal genres? \"Catch 33\" takes in jazz complexities to create a truly complex and original 47 minute journey. To describe the sound of Meshuggah, I shall welcome in those who love technical metal that plays at death metal standards. The 8 string guitars churn out some disgustingly low and heavy riffs. The only true emotions to get out of the music and lyrics are paranoia, fear and intense coldness. The lyrics are bleak and philosophical. These lyrics aren't what you would expect from the extreme metal genre. One way of describing them is to imagine how a robot or a cold, angular machine with sharp edges would view humanity if it could process any kind of thought.\n\nWhat is it that makes \"Catch 33\" so good? Aside from being a bold and daring experiment, what amazes me most about this album is how much thought has gone into the complexity. So many odd time signatures, yet it never sounds offputtingly busy. However it is a complete mindfuck if you try and follow the rhythmic passages or unpredictable time signatures. Meshuggah have proved that you don't need to be fast to be mindblowingly heavy, as the tempo's on this album run rather slowly. The riffs are chuggy and powerful and succeed in their brutality, not only by using intense detuning but played to rhythms that make them sound hypnotic and mezmerizing.\n\n\"Catch 33\" owes a lot to progressive metal. This certainly a progressive 47 minute ongoing piece of music. Possibly the only prog metal related album to contain no extended gutiar soloing, endless shredding and wankery! The vocals are so harsh that they sound like Jens is incapable of human emotion. The only real opportunity to find any beauty is in \"Minds Mirrors\", a cosmic and spacey transition in the album that reflects \"Cosmic Sea\" by Death, or the album \"Focus\" by Cynic. The drums have been programmed concisely on a drum machine, but this does not at all detract from the music experience, if anything it makes the experiment more successful and I would never have been able to tell it was computerised drumming if I hadn't read it in the credits. Thomas Haake is an incredible drummer and is so complex and consise and he definitely could have played the drumming if the drum programming wasn't used. The rhythm section of the band is impressive and something they have took time to master. It all falls into place with this album, as hinted by the previous EP \"I\".\n\nThe journey of mind melting death jazz can be summarised in the way that it is a journey. The first 3 tracks may sound similar to the untrained ear, but they are actually different in the way they have been constructed. The slow riff that sounds like a robotic killing machine pounding a human skull into dust keeps on building and building over the first 3 short tracks. This is the idea, to build up more and more. In \"The Paradoxial Spiral\" the angular riffage drains out into a cold tremlo picking of a single note that leaves the listener in fear until it finally explodes. The album gets more and more brutal until it reaches its centrepoint. Everything calms down a little for \"Minds Mirrors\". But this track is the mere taking in of breathe before the true plunge into the depths begins. The second half of the album is true annihilation. relentless brutality, more complexity, more interesting and epic. Jens vocals keep the listener on the edge of the seat as they work so freely over offbeat guitars that work like no other metal tune has been structured.\n\nMeshuggah are the future of metal, and to hear \"Catch 33\" is to be convinced that these guys have actually come from the future and somehow landed in 2005! This is a masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of metal. It's bands like Meshuggah that are keeping metal alive and breathing, and making sure that it can still be original. It may take a few listens to truly \"get\" or appreciate this work but it is very much worth the effort. This is recommended for fans of extreme brutal metal, and who aren't threatened by complex, technical music. Otherwise I suggest sticking with earlier works such as \"Contradictions Collapse\" or \"Destroy/Erase/Improve\". Lets just hope the machine that is Meshuggah doesn't spiral out of control too soon!\n",
        "\nI've heard a lot of metal bands and more than plenty metal songs. This album is really something special. In my book, this is absolutely the heaviest album of all time.\n\nIt's not heavy in a Mayhem \"look at how much noise we're making!\" type of way, but in a kick the doors down crunchy and nasty way. The guitar sound on this album is out of this world, and the performances by Tomas Haake (drums) and Jens Kidman (vocals) are legendary. The songs are not so much songs, but like the output of a giant machine chewing the earth into dust.\n\nConcatenation gets the fun off with a blast, with one of the most chaotic, insane blasts of hell ever created. The next series of songs are the real gems here, with New Millenium Cyanide Christ and Corridor of Chameleons with excellent riffing that would have you headbanging in a business meeting. Neurotica has a crazy tribal beat, and damned if the song won't get stuck in your head. This leads into..\n\nThe Mouth Licking What You've Bled, one of the most incredible works ever put to magnetic tape (or into a computer, depending on your perspective). This song is as heavy as heavy can get. It will blow the doors off your house (or car), for real. The guitar solo in this song is one of the most mesmerizing lines a person ever performed on a musical instrument. It further proves Fredrik Thordendal is a master of his craft and one of the great musical geniuses (not to say ill of Marten Hagstrom, who is a master in his own right). The rest of the material is great too, Elastic being an excellent song and you'll remember Sane from the True Human Design e.p.\n\nThis album is so incredibly dark and forbidding that it may take a few listens to find a home in. Once you do, it's clear. This album is a landmark among landmarks in the immortal canon of the Meshuggah library, but a must have. This album kills.\n\nAfter it came out I wondered where Meshuggah would go next, especially after putting the exclamation point on death metal with the miracle that is Chaosphere. Thankfully Nothing came out and didn't push the envelope as much, but bent it in a new direction, but that is a review for another time.\n",
        "\nDamn, and I thought Nothing was the ultimate in Heaviness. THis album makes Nothing sound as easy as a Nickelback album. Furious guitars, super odd ball guitars an drums.. just one long slab of noise.\n\nThere's no room to breathe here, as millions of super odd time riffs just come at you, again and again. While later releases give you a lot of time to breathe, and even allow a bit of groove to get through, there's none of that here. None. Just tonnes of super busy riffs that are ultimately off kilter, being backed by some of the best drumming ever. Tomas Haake is amazing how he pulls off these beats I have no idea. Try New Millenium Cyanide Christ... How many time sigs is he playing??? Amazing.\n\nAll this talk about strange riffs and polyrythmics..Most bands who try to do this sound like crap, but Meshuggah manage to pull it off, because they're one of the few math-metal bands that realise odd ball riffs aren't everything. Every riff is full of passion, every riff is full of anger, and that's the odd paradox about Meshuggah. You get some off the strangest, most machine like music ever but there's still plenty of humanity in some form or the other. Maybe that's just me though.\n\nStill, there's a few problems here. Meshuggah riffs are well known for being repetitive, but it's very bad on this album. Worse then the later stuff, definetly. Most of it consists of one or two notes being played in a very fast and off kilter way. While it's quite good, it takes a while to really understand the riffs. But that's always been Meshuggah for you.. Only repeated listening can reveal to you the secrets that the riffs hide. The vocals are fairly weak too, as I've mentioned. Kidman doesn't let any really long screams go through, most of the vocals are off kilter and choppy like the guitars, but for the most part it doesn't work, indeed the vocals even come off as nu-metalish at times. The lyrics aren't quite up to the amazing abstract stuff that's in the later albums, but that's fair enough, I guess. Still, comparing some of these songs' lyrics to the stuff in say, Glints Collide or the whole of Catch 33, you can see that Meshuggah had a lot to improve.\n\nNonetheless, this is a very good album. It's not Meshuggah's best album by a long way, but it's probably their heaviest, which surely counts for something. Well worth getting for strange people who like strange music.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah have always been a weird, strange band. Strange polyrythmics, esoteric (yet very cool) lyrics, super down tuned, repetitive riffing, over and over again. Sometimes the stuff they write sounds more like Industrial building noise then music. \n\nOf course, it's fairly obvious to say that to fully appreciate a Meshuggah album, you need to listen to it again, and again. No previous Meshuggah album takes as much effort as this album, and I definetly don't blame people who say this is a big laod of donkey balls. One big long song divided into a few parts to make it more accessible. A bit more melodic then Nothing.. but then again, what album isn't more melodic then Nothing? \n\nYou probably already know what to expect in this album. There's tonnes of those riffs we like, strange drumming, although It would be unfair to say it's like every other Meshuggah album. The lyrics are probably the best I've ever heard from Meshuggah. The lyrics flow very, very well from song to song, though you'd expect that. I have no idea what the theme of the album is.. But then again, Meshuggah have never been easy to interpret.\n\nThere's a fair bit of cool experimentation here. Mind's Mirrors sounds nothing like anything Meshuggah, or indeed, anyone else has ever done. Strange, clean robotic vocals coming out of nowhere, slowly echoing around, followed by some clean guitar that becomes extra dissonant by the time the song ends. Marvellous stuff. WHile a lot of the riffs are the usual bottom five frets of the 8th string deal, there's definetly a bit more innovation in the riffs, a bit more of the fretboard used. THere's also a few riffs that appear throughout the album, and they're used to great effect. Shed is probably the most accessible thing Meshuggah have ever done. Yeah, it's still really, really strange and heavy, but it's got a riff that's actually quite easy to head bang too, and the cool, eerie bits of clean guitar really help it. Probably the best song on the album.\n\nSo to sum up, this is a very weird album. Basically, if you like it, you're weird. Although it's easier to get into then say, the Nothing album, listening to it the whole way through takes a lot of endurance. Nonetheless, it is a pretty damn good album, and so if you're weird, you should check it out. A good to play if you want to annoy the neighbours. Best tracks: Shed, Mind's Mirrors, and the epic In Death- Is Death.\n",
        "\nIf there ever was a band to cause such unneccessary waves in Metal, it's Meshuggah. I always thought it was kind of ironic that the word 'dichotomy' seems to be one of Meshuggah's favourite ideals and lyrical themes, when Meshuggah's music causes one. \"Catch 33,\" Meshuggah's newest album, is a new exercise in brutality brought upon by very ambiguous manners. It also sheds light on the situation that Meshuggah have put people into, here.\n\nEssentially, Meshuggah is the definition of Avant-Garde Metal. Comparing them to their fundamental counterparts would be like comparing Rush to Black Sabbath, the only difference being you can hear up-front what makes Rush sound like they'd define the future of Metal. Let's face it, everyone loves Black Sabbath, but I can't count more Rush clones off-hand than Sabbath clones. Hell, I'm pretty sure all of you have heard of Dream Theater before. Back to my point, though. Meshuggah didn't start with Black Sabbath, nor pissing on Bibles. Meshuggah started with Allan Holdsworth. Since the beginning of Meshuggah's career, they've sounded different, as even though they were one of millions of Metallica emulators, they sounded drastically different. Their sense of theory sounded so far removed from Metal that even if it sucked, you'd still think to yourself: \"Wow, what a weird approach.\" Fundamentally, that is where the line between Meshuggah fans and haters is drawn. \n\nCatch 33 is an album from a band that cannot be confined by genres. Technical Post-Thrash, Progressive Metal, Math Metal, Jazz Metal, Death Metal... Meshuggah's tried them all on, and still nothing sticks. That's the brilliance of Meshuggah, and the brilliance of their latest flag-ship release. Catch 33 is just weird. Meshuggah is a band for weird people to revel in weird music. Their weird theories are converted intelligently into weird audible notions through very subtle manners. Want to know what it's like to be high? Trace one of the myriad of time signatures going on in a Meshuggah song. Try to predict one of Tomas Haake's drum patterns and feel yourself stumble mentally over and over again as you constantly get it wrong. \n\nCatch 33 is brilliant in that aspect because it's so many things but still far-removed from itself. You know exactly what you're going to hear, but it's not what you hear, even though it still is what you hear. The technical differences that are present upon output only vary slightly from what you'd expect, and even though upfront you wouldn't be able to tell the difference if you were just remembering a single riff, but you wouldn't be able to reproduce it either. Being a long-time Meshuggah fan, I knew exactly what was coming after Nothing and I, but even then, I was still blown away after I heard this album. Moments like \"Mind's Mirrors\" and \"In Death-Is Life\" and it's counter-part, sister track(The end of \"Sum\" felt like a Neurosis-brand of redemption) caught me off-guard, even though I knew that this sort of thing wouldn't be far-removed for Meshuggah, it's more like a mystery in why they chose that certain musical route to take.\n\nI've heard people complain about how the first few songs all utilize the same riffs, but when you bring the time of the songs into perspective, these assaults just seem trivial. The first three tracks are pretty much the same riff, yeah, but look at the lengths. Never longer than two minutes. The point of making these songs like this is to set the mood for the album, which is imperative to interpret what you're hearing. The riff slowly gnaws it's way into your head, making a hole just wide enough to put the barrel in. It's not until \"Mind's Mirrors\" that you start to realize this isn't just a gun, it's a fucking Howitzer.\n\nMeshuggah is all about mentality. I'm not going to say that people just don't understand Meshuggah, because Meshuggah are no great mystery. Meshuggah have just shifted away from the fundamental and conservative aspects of brutality and ushered in an original and potent method that uses structure instead of sound. Overtones instead of bludgeoning riffs off the tip of the latest blast-beat in a series of a million. There's a mindset you have to be in to feel full-force what Meshuggah's aim is, and a mindset to see how incredibly accurately they hit the mark. \n\n(*If you're an active musician, then you're definitely going to pick up on Meshuggah's structurally trippy stylings. Also sample some of the various styles of riffing used here. One thing most people don't seem to understand about Meshuggah is that while their songs do often sound alike, there's such a multi-faceted technical approach to them that if you're a musician, \"Autonomy Lost\" and \"Re-Inanimate\" are going to sound as different as a feather falling and a bomb exploding would.)\n",
        "\nHaving never heard Meshuggah before I bought this album, I had no idea what to expect. One thing I wasn't expecting though was for this album to be so damn heavy and brutal, and so damn good.\n\nThis album jumps at you straight away and doesn't let go. Stengah is a sickeningly brutal song, with very downtuned guitars playing a jarring staccato beat. The drums lock in very very tightly with the guitars, and then the vocals kick in, being a dry hardcore kinda bark. It's rather excellent stuff, and it doesn't let up for a very long time.\n\nMost of the riffs sound fairly similar in this album, but repeated listens show off the variety in this album. The jarring, staccato stutter of Stengah, the super strange time sigs and speed of Glints Collide, the kinda thrashy (?) opening riff of Straws Pulled at Random, and the list goes on. The cool thing is, Meshuggah are capable of doing fairly cool clean parts as well, like in the opening of Obsidian. They're done very rarely as well, which makes them sound all the more cooler, and which makes the heavier parts even heavier.\n\nI haven't mentioned the drums yet, but they're amazing too. For the most part, they play relatively simple beats, with the occaisonal complex pattern. Glints Collide is a great example of this, with an incredibly complex opening drum beat. Of course, the Polyrythyms, with is a Meshuggah signature, play a huge part in this record, really making the whole thing more jarring and off beat. They must be incredibly difficult to play live as well. Polyrythyms=Hard.\n\nTo conclude, I have no idea how this album compared to other Meshuggah albums, or if it's a good introduction, or whatever. It's not a very easy listen, and for some it will sound mind-numbingly repetitive and dull. But a few listens reveal that this album is a gem. You don't need this album, but you should buy it anyway.\n",
        "\nIt's going to be difficult to match the articulated brilliance and linguistic mastery of the previous review, but here it goes. Meshuggah's latest album, \"Catch Thirty-Three\" is perhaps their strangest offering to date, the reason being that they make use of...a drum machine. Now, after listening to previous Meshuggah albums such as \"Chaosphere\" and \"Nothing\", I'm sure that Tomas Haake would be able to play this stuff, so it leaves me to wonder why they opted for the machine, possibly to make this grating music more cerebral than it already is?\n\nThis is where Meshuggah is definitely a polarized band amongst metal fans - their music is so damn scary and robotic that it scares many off into mindlessly insulting them as a sort of \"math-nu\" metal. Label them as one may, Meshuggah deliver what was expected of them, musically, on this album. While it may be indeed \"one song\", it definitely has breaks and changes, although the opening riff does stretch longer than it should. Kidman's vocals are horrendous and sound even more robotic than on previous albums, but again, they suit the music wonderfully.\n\nDespite the lack of live drums, the musicianship is still mind-blowing, especially in the guitar riffs. Listen to \"In Death - Is Death\" to see what I mean. Also, as was hinted on the EP \"I\", there are more instances of strange ambience, \"Mind's Mirrors\", for example, I can see as a being a turn-off to fans, myself included. In my opinion, Meshuggah should stick with the technical debauchery rather than testing the trance waters. As for specific high points on the album? \"Autonomy Lost\", as well as its musical successors are powered by a familiar sounding riff (\"I\", anyone?), \"In Death - Is Death\" is over 13 minutes, and is a difficult journey to get through, but incredibly scary in musicianship. \"Personae_non_gratae\" is likely the most difficult song to head bang to ever, as well as the follower, \"Dehumanization\". The album's closer, \"Sum\" ends with a long scream, and ambience to conclude this work. \n\nAs others will no doubt inform you, this album is definitely not for anyone, but if there is somewhere to start with Meshuggah, \"Catch Thirty-Three\", in my mind, can be considered their most accessable album. Give it a chance. To borrow a quote from my friend: \"You have bands like Tool and Floyd bringing emotion and love to music...and then you have Meshuggah, bringing the mathematics of hell\".\n\nJust you try it on.\n",
        "\nI think the best way to look at this cd is in the context to which the band wrote it. there is no bass player on this cd they used eight string guitars, also, they are a rhythmic band, its not thrash anymore they did away with the thrash elements, which in my opinion made the music more mainstream (like we need anymore Metallica rip-off bands). Most of the complaints people levy against this cd pertain to things such as repetition, but its only repetitious to those who don't listen carefully. Another complaint is the cd is \"easier\" or less complex, which is untrue, this album is very complex probably moreso than what they did in the past, its the natural progression of things you can't expect a band to continue to release albums that continue to use the exact same elements their previous works used, you'd probably find another reason to complain then.\n\nThe album itself is slower, and as previously stated their really no thrash elements in this piece. The lyrical themes are basically the same, however lyrics seem to have always taken the backseat in meshuggah's work. The guitar parts are weird, really weird, the rhythms are becoming more and more complex (which is a good thing, if you have the patience to understand), the meter is odd and the solo's compliment nicely. There is more of a jazzier element to the album, particularly as it pertains to solos, listen to closed eye visuals to get what I mean.\n\nIn conclusion, the best way to listen to this music is to realize its an opus of complex rythmns, and has nothing to do with melody. Quit judging Meshuggah based on their past works and judge each piece individually. Patience is imporant, I didn't like Meshuggah the first time I heard it (thought it was all the same) but after I opened my ears, the music began to make more sense. The band intentionally dropped many of the thrash elements from their music to make way for the more intense and intelligent beats to be brought into the foreground. If thrash elements had been added to this album, it would have been a wishy washy mess. This is the new evolution that is Meshuggah and it is a welcome change in my opinion.\n",
        "\nHow can we go wrong here? With Hypocrisy, putting out one of their best songs ever, and Meshuggah putting out their best song EVER, we have a true classic. A short one, but still classic. I had never heard of this split album before I read about it here, but I'll sure track it down somehow.\n\nHypocrisys' \"Roswell 47\" is a midpaced metal song with great melody and Peters' ultimate thoughts. The most interesting, however, is how Peter got the guitars sounding so fucking crunchy. I mean, right off from the start, as the first powerchord can be heard, it hits you how much time must have been given to mix the guitars. I have never heard anything like it. The song itself is catchy as hell, and you soon find yourself nodding along, and later, headbanging along to the powerful drum- and guitarcoordination. It sounds quite the same throughout the whole tune, but it really works. Great!\n\nMeshuggah offers \"Future Breed Machine\" from their album \"Destroy Erase Improve\", and it's easily their best effort ever. It has been said that they have the greatest drummer on earth, and I must confess... Thomas Haake is one bastard behind the drumkit. At times, you don't understand half of his technique, and at other times, you find yourself gazing with your mouth wide open at his blizzardfast tempos. The drums don't follow any structure for the most of the time, making it sound weird, but very VERY good. The guitarsound is powerful, but they could have been higher in the mix. They have successfully completed their mission (which is future mechanical takeover if you believe the lyrics), as the vocalist sound like a death-metal-robot. He doesn't have any melodies nor does his shrieking sound like your average death metal singer. He rather lashes out, giving all he can to make sure evolution will stop :)\n\nAll in all, this is a perfect effort from both bands, and sadly, I don't think we ever get to hear any of them at this highpoint never more.\n",
        "\nI is currently the most recent offering from Meshuggah.. An EP of a single track.. Also called I. Okay. So I'd heard a lot about how creative and artistic this single track was. While I love Chaosphere and have heard some other Meshuggah and enjoyed it, when I saw this used for $5 I thought I'd pick it up and try it. That was a complete mistake.\n\nOne of the most important things in writing a song is to make it actually have a purpose, and go somewhere. If you can write beautiful 20 minute songs that progress somewhere, then you're quite talented. However, no one in Meshuggah understands that they have to progress somewhere. This song drones on in the same pattern as most of the material on Nothing, except they repeat themselves 3 times more than normal. The beginning starts with 1:32 of the same riffs being played.. Over.. And over. And over. Then it stops, and goes on to 20 seconds of screaming and noise. At 2 minutes, you're finally into the song. Nothing spectacular occurs, vocals in the usual manner, music proceeds in a quite generic way. After this set of verses the music picks up a little and has an interesting rythmic part to it, then the vocals kick back in and the guitar effects cut down. Then we go back to boring repetition of a single sound for awhile. Then vocals over that. Simple drumbeats in the background. Insert crazy, random guitar solo here that bursts out of nowhere. Sounds good. Should have been used somewhere that it actually fit.\n\nBy the time this is over, you're more than a fourth through the song. Vocals over pretty simple drumming with the usual, fast Meshuggah guitar parts bursting in. Vocals quit, drumbeat continues on the same damn drum over and over. Guitar enters for a short, useless bit, cuts out again, vocals re-enter. Same single drum/symbol pattern continues that you've been hearing for quite awhile. Everything stops for a strange guitar sound, I suppose. This goes on for awhile, quite awkwardly, stopping the already droning and boring pace of the song. Fitting for an end, not for the middle of a song. Then everything starts back up suddenly, with a new drum beat at last, decent guitar riffing. So on, so forth, for the next minute. Then the trademark background wailing guitar sound you expect from Meshuggah comes in, making you think a cool solo's gonna happen, but.. No, it's just two notes held for a long time. Vocals enter, still on the same sounds that have been going on for around 2 minutes now. Everything changes again, new rhythm, based mostly around a pretty simple drumbeat looping and guitar riffs that drone on back and forth between two utterly simple sounds, with vocals going over it once again. Goes on, quits, then vocals over more generic garbage you felt like you've heard for most of the album thusfar. And quits.\n\nThen it starts back up, again, with crazy wailing guitar solo. Again, cool sounding, but it should be put to something good where it was built up to, not from one sudden change to the next.\n\nRhythm changes again, continues in a semi-interesting manner. Vocals kick up again, and proceeds to go on for all too long. Then it does the whole, stop, and have something that sounds like it's for ending a song, of silence, with sudden guitar riff and drum, fades out.. Four times. Slow, silent guitar played for awhile over the same notes, hold, repeat. It builds up (First time anything has built up in this song, just sudden changes for the rest of it) to louder drumming and 'atmospheric\" garbage, while the drumming repeats the same pattern. And finally, it jumps into more guitar playing, in a slow manner.. Still droning on. The buildup was more interesting than the actual result here. This drones on over and over again, like every other part of the song.. Vocals kick in after some guitar is dropped. Decent sound to this part as it changes guitar throughout parts of it. Vocals drop again, guitar starts up playing the same four notes over and over again to everything else that's been going on for the last couple minutes. This seems to end several times as the guitar suddenly drops to a hold for a moment, then it starts back up again. Their guitarist had the right idea to try to end the song, but it's like the drummer wouldn't quit drumming, and thus, keeps repeating the same parts. Finally he holds it on a note, and the song fades out on that note and 30 seconds of feedback.\n\nReally, this isn't a bad song. It would make a rather interesting song if it weren't for the fact that every portion of the song feels like it's drawn out for 2 to 3 times what it should be. Meshuggah pulled off ~10 minute songs fine with Chaosphere, which really is the only full material I have to compare it to, but.. Something happened between Chaosphere and I quite obviously, with which Meshuggah seems to have dropped the creativity and replaced it with forced attempts at being artistic.\n\nIt's okay, but not too enjoyable. Some very good parts to it though, if only they were used in a better manner and not reused for all too long. If it's cheap, I suppose it's worth getting. I don't feel bad about getting it. But I don't really listen to it, either. I sits on the shelf.. And, well. Sits there. Chaosphere is pulled out weekly for a listen.\n\nDon't expect much real creativity out of I.\n",
        "\nThis six track EP from Meshuggah is quite an interesting piece of work. \n\nFirst track on the EP comes from their (then upcoming) album \"Chaosphere\". Sane is a typical Meshuggah song with extreme detuned riffs (I think its down to G# on this one), Jens Kidman screaming and howling at the air as usual, odd rhythms... Nothing really unusual about this one. \n\nSecond track is a live cut of their single from Destroy, Erase, Improve \"Future Breed Machine\". Awesome on the studio version and it is replicated flawlessly live. \n\nThird track is a remix of Future Breed Machine dubbed the \"Mayhem Version\" This version is much slower and more sludgy than the original, and Jens is giving 110% with his vocals on it. Altogether it is very brutal and extremely heavy. \n\nThe next track is the reason why I bought this EP. In typical Meshuggah style humour the guys from the band recorded a \"Campfire mix\" of Future Breed Machine with accoustic guitars and called it Futile Bread Machine. The lead vocals sound like Jens is on helium. Hilarious stuff and this makes it worth the purchase alone.\n\nThe last two tracks caught me by surprise because they aren't listed on the back of CD. Basically Meshuggah made two electronica/techno pieces about six minutes long each and added them to the EP. In my opinion they're actually quite good, but I can see that a many \"metalheads\" would not apprieciate them. \n\nOverall: Worth the purchase, but only if you're in it for the funny antics and you have an apprieciation for the techno. Otherwise I'd feel that someone would be hard pressed in justifying spending $12 for a song which you can get on the studio albums and 3 versions of the same song + 2 experimental non-metal pieces.\n",
        "\nTwo years ago Swedish metal act Meshuggah provided the scene with one of the most talked about (if not THE most) albums of 2002. Much has been written about the \u2018Nothing\u2019 disc \u2013 some completely loathe it, others love it and the rest (which probably includes me) are still trying to understand it. No matter which category you put your self in, it is clear that no other band sounds quite like Meshuggah. Having left the metal world in an utterly confused state, only the very brave could guess at which direction they would take next. So what do they do? Well rather than take the easy path (and the commercial direction that many a fool predicted), they release a ONE track EP entitled \u2018I\u2019 that runs for 21 minutes. Whaaaahht??\n\nThe one major bone of contention that fans had about the \u2018Nothing\u2019 album was that momentum/speed/pacing wise, it was devoid of all. It meandered on and on, all with typical Meshuggah stylings and superb musicianship, but its one pace minimalism disappointed many. Without question, \u2018Nothing\u2019 was a challenge to sit through. Maybe the band has responded to these concerns, or maybe they haven\u2019t, but \u2018I\u2019 is more akin to the rhythms and tempos that \u2018Chaosphere and \u2018DEI\u2019 displayed. Fans of those albums will be extremely taken with what \u2018I\u2019 has to offer.\n\nA 21-minute track has never been what I would classify as a \u2018song\u2019. Tracks this long are more like a collage of a bands progressive capability. It has to flow; it has to have variation in tempo and ideas, light and shade and a cohesive feel about it. Whether Meshuggah has actually achieved this with \u2018I\u2019 is debatable in my eyes, but nevertheless, at least we cannot complain about its tempo or its variation of ideas. \n\nIt is worth describing just what happens during \u2018I\u2019 as it is a rather interesting, if slightly disjointed ride. From the outset, the up tempo rhythm is laid bare \u2013 a technical riff structure tears through in the same monotonous pattern for exactly 1.34 seconds (I was beginning to wonder if my disc was skipping). Then for something different (for Meshuggah anyway) \u2013 Jens Kidman\u2019s wild screaming over a furious Noisecore, blast beat section before settling into a wicked up tempo rhythm. At 5.40, we witness the beginning of some simply incredible Fredrick Thordendal solo work (which he carries forth throughout certain sections of the entire disc) and a frenetic thrash style pace set by the human Octopus himself Tomas Haake. At 6.50, the tempo shifts up another gear with Haake\u2019s performance now proving to be impossible to these ears. At 7.48, the first of three major tempo changes \u2013 nothing but a solitary guitar line playing a slow chiming, ambient like section before plunging into a typical Meshuggah mid tempo romp at 8.40 \u2013 Jens\u2019 vocals working in time with the riffs with apparent ease. At 12 minutes, another easing off in the tempo kicks in with some off kilter timing and ambient back masking vocals and melodic lead lines \u2013 this segues into a simply mind boggling tripped out drug addled solo from Thordendal. This cannot be played by anyone else. At 14.20, we get the final tempo change, this time a slow doom like structure and gentle lead section builds up to the 16-minute mark where track becomes just a tad darker and moodier in feel. The riffs are static and choppy with an underlying melodic lead line that is maintained right through until the tracks end. I like the variation in employed here \u2013 but if I had to make a choice, the final 7 minutes of \u2018I\u2019 are not as convincing or enthralling as the earlier passages.\n\nIt goes without saying that the musicianship displayed here is nothing short of godlike. Meshuggah fans have never doubted this. \u2018I\u2019 is signature Meshuggah \u2013 it continues to highlight their flawless talents in the most dramatic fashion. The production, similarly is top notch and if anything an improvement on the one-dimensional \u2018dry\u2019 feel that was achieved on \u2018Nothing\u2019.\n\nI think it is safe to say that \u2018I\u2019 will cause the necessary buzz that it was created to induce. \u2018Catch 33\u2019 is the title of the new disc and if the musical ideas of \u2018I\u2019 is anything to go by, then it will be a very interesting release. No doubt, there will be some surprises \u2013 just like the unpredictability of \u2018Nothing\u2019 through to this EP, nothing is never guaranteed with Meshuggah. I can\u2019t wait actually.\n",
        "\nReading the reviews of Meshuggah there seem to be two prevailing views: either it's the most brilliantly technical album ever, or it's the most boring album in the history of metal. I'll take a middle-position, and here's why: I have an affinity for intricacy and complex patterns in music, but my knowledge of musical technicality is limited to the terms tone-heigth, riff, solo and tremolo-picking, and I'm probably misusing those half the time. So this review is for people who like me can make out time-changes only if explicitly told where, and then still with difficulty.\n\nThe downtuned guitars are what you notice the first when listening to this album. They're immensely downtuned, and vary in tone relatively little. But in that small margin of tone-variation, they use the whole spectrum extensively. What this means is that the guitars play complex riffs, but you have to expend extra energy to make them out completely. The vocals mirror this: the harsh drill-instructor screams bark rythmically, matching the other instruments, not only in rythm, but also in tone; little margin, but precision therein. The exception seems to come from the occasional solo, although I'm not sure if one could call them solos. Hypnotic and patterned, they use the higher tones achievable on the 8-string guitars used, for that eery contrast with the rest of the guitarsound.\n\nJarring is the right word to describe the riffs. These are riffs that get on someone's nerves really quickly if that person is not into this sort of music. Counter-intuitive and a-typical, they are planned out meticulously however, to create a complex overall pattern. This album wouldn't have worked if the whole band wasn't on the same line in both technical skill and intent. I wouldn't say all elements fall together seemlessly. A more accurate comparison would be to liken this album to a modernist industrial oilrefinery: an accumulation of hard steel formed into a complex whole hard to oversee by a single person. Ugly, lifeless and harsh to common sensibility, but pleasing to some.\n\nHence the two differing views. I've got to hand one thing to the criticasters: it's extremely tiring and mentally draining to listen to 10 tracks of jarring music, and this album would've benefitted from having two random songs cut out. In the end they all start to sound like eachother.\n",
        "\nThis is the first Meshuggah album that I owned, and the album that would eventually get me into melodic death metal. As much as I hate Chaosphere and Nothing, this is an excellent album. It's inventive, unique, and thrashy, all at the same time. And in fact, I don't see how it would be possible to not headbang and mosh to this album.\n\n\"Future Breed Machine\" greets us first with a very futuristic sound to it with a death alarm sounding throughout. Tomas Haake's drumming is some of the best to come out of the country of Sweden, where the band also happens to hail from. Plus, the rhythm guitar work and riffs are very heavy as well. Vocals are shouty on all tracks, as the vocalist sounds a little like Max Cavalera of Sepultura. \"Beneath\" is the next track, and starts out with sharp lead guitar work at its onset, before working into a heavier riff pattern. Once again, the drumming is out of control, but very good at the same time. \"Soul Burn\" has a nice guitar solo from about the 2:45 to the 3:38 mark, and also features some excellent riffing. \"Transfixion\" is more thrashy and less groovy than the songs on either side of it, and once again, there are some brutally heavy riffs and solid lead guitar work. The drumming on \"Transfixion\" and \"Vanished\" has to be seen to be believed, it's amazing the eye to detail that Haake shows to his work.\n\n\"Acrid Placidity\" is a fairly mellow-sounding instrumental, highlighted by the lead guitar work. \"Inside What's Within Behind\" has a pulsing rhythm in the beginning, and then works into those crazy off-beat drum rhythms that have defined Meshuggah's career. Then, at about the 2:35 mark, a softer, yet spooky sounding interlude works in, before ending on a heavy note. \"Terminal Illusions\" is full of stop-and-go riffs and thrash-style drums, after you get done headbanging to this song, your head will feel like it's ready to fall off. \"Suffer In Truth\" is the next track, is the most cohesive of the songs found here, with not as much staccato being used as on the other tracks here. Instead, it is a groove-based track, as the rhythm here is fairly steady. \"Sublevels\" is softer, but ends on a strong note, with a good guitar solo at the 1:52 - 2:40 mark.\n\nIf you're into death, melodic death, or industrial metal, this is another can't miss album. If you're looking to get someting from Meshuggah, DEI is the best place to start.\n",
        "\nI'm not sure what the big hype is about these guys. I didn't see anything special. This is the second album of Meshuggah's I've heard, and guess what? THEY BOTH SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME!!! And what's all this \"technicality\" people are talking about? I'm not seeing any. Every song is pretty much the same thing, aside from a 20 second solo every here and there. None of the solo's are even all that complicated either. There aren't even any good riffs, its all basic chord shit. The drumming ain't that great either, so I don't know where \"drum genius\" came into the picture here. And the vocals, oh the fucking vocals. At first they were okay, but after a while I couldn't stand them! The guy has no fucking rhythm. Its all just yelling like an angsty constipated teen. Rather sickening if you ask me.\n\nThere are a few listenable tracks that are thrashy and enjoyable...but really nothing outstanding about this album. Or any Meshuggah album for that matter.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah's breakout success Destroy Erase Improve, which has often been called the best industrial thrash album of the 90s, along with Fear Factory's Demanufacture and others, is a testament to the band's awe-inspiring technicality and brute force.\n\nEvery song showcases Fredrik Thordenthal's incredibly off-meter guitar-playing with its often alien-like tone, Tomas Haake's precise drumming, and Jens Kidman's arrogant drill-sergeant barking. \n\nWhereas their latest album Nothing blended from one song to the other almost seamlessly and each song had an unceasing, thick, crunchy groove, DeI is more focused and more thrash-oriented. One should not call this band thrash however, as they are not. The tone of the guitar is not indicative of the genre and the soloing is not parallel either, although it is quite masterful on the album. \n\nBeginning this chaos is Future Breed Machine, which sounds like judgment day, where all the robots have started taking over the world. Industrial noises begin the song, then a piercing siren takes over for a couple seconds before erupting into a total onslaught. Headbanging to this will most likely give you whiplash. \n\nBeneath is nothing to call home about. Soul Burn begins with a pounding slow groove before whipping into a schizophrenic fury of guitars, leading you into one direction before jerking you into another. Jens Kidman sounds especially great on this song as well, his syncopated vocals in the chorus added extra rhythm to the song.\n\nTransfixion and Vanished keep the train rolling until Meshuggah hit us with the unexpected instrumental Acrid Placidity. Wow, this is incredibly ambient and lulling. All you metal purists will be surprised to learn that Meshuggah has a soft side. \n\nUnfortunately, this is just an instrumental track, and we don't hear Kidman singing in a beautiful voice like Burton C. Bell might do on a slow track.\n\nThis is meant for you to catch your breath. The next three songs are the same old ass-kicking Meshuggah until the last track Sublevels, which is an ominous instrumental closer. Meshuggah continues the trend of closing their albums with an odd little instrumental on Nothing, and I think it works very effectively.\n\nSome bad things about this album are that you never hear Kidman with any melodic vocals, and though it may be trivial, it's a bit bothersome. Also, as a previous reviewer said, the songs tend to be difficult to distinguish from one another. Many bands and albums fall victim to this, however.\n\nIf you think it's bad on this album, just wait until you buy Nothing. You'll see what I'm talking about. \n\nAnother thing that bothers me about DeI is that Tomas Haake's 'voice' isn't on here, or if it is, it isn't too prevalent. You know what I'm talking about---that cute cyborg voice that adds pleasant variety to Meshuggah's already unique sound? Well, he doesn't utilize it that much here. It's not a major detriment to the album that he doesn't, but it's something that bothers me. Whether it bothers other Meshuggah fans or other metalheads is unknown.\n\nAnyway, this is an excellent album and much more vile and twisted than many a death metal band/album, IMO. Whereas many death metal bands just use pure undiluted aggression, Meshuggah immerses you into a thick, humid jungle, the atmosphere often being incredibly heavy and suffocating, leaving you gasping for air as you struggle to breathe in each minute fiber of riffage and everchanging rhythms.\n",
        "\nThis is the latest album from Swedish post-thrash gods Meshuggah. Although this release isn't as straightforward or ass-kicking as the classic Destroy Erase Improve, it is very groundbreaking for the band and for metal in general. Here we have a collection of songs that don't function particularly well individually and don't really 'stand out', but rather make up a long, complicated, jarring journey of sound. \n\nPresent here are Meshuggah's trademark use of odd time signatures, abrupt changes in rhythm, Fredrik Thordenthal's bizarre insect-like guitar-soloing, and the drill-sergeant barking of the vocalist.\n\nWhat sets this apart from Destroy Erase Improve and previous releases is that it is heavier and the songs all run together, each song possessing a relentless groove that starts almost immediately and changes directions frequently. I'm hard-pressed to even call this album thrash in any respect, whether it be post-thrash or even plain thrash, because it's just not straightforward enough. \n\nMeshuggah have truly forged a unique sound on this album, and even though Meshuggah fans and other metalheads may dislike the new sound, I enjoy it and I think people should respect artists' wishes to evolve their sound. I'm sure everyone can rest assure that the band is not capable of selling out. \n\nSome of the best soloing occurs on this album, the best one probably occurring on Glints Collide. Man, that's insane stuff. The classic 'robotic' voice is reprised on this album too on the track Nebulous. I see nothing wrong with hearing a full album of the drill-sergeant rants, but it's nice to hear a change of vocals and it adds a further creepy dimension to their music. \n\nThe only throwaway track on the album is the last track, Obsidian. It's nothing more than one simple riff repeated over and over again. I suppose it's done for a foreboding effect, insinuating \"We're not finished with you yet. Wait til the next album comes out, it will kick your ass.\", but it's generally annoying. \n\nI recommend this album to all who seek something heavy and unconventional in their metal, as this album is far from your typical release from a band that is less than typical themselves.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah, for those who don't know, is a band that masterfully blends the speed and energy of thrash metal, the driving, mechanical riffs of industrial, and the blazing technicality of progressive metal, making for one of the most popular \"real\" metal bands of our time. \"Destroy Erase Improve\" is definitely the zenith of their innovative efforts.\n\nLet's start with the good. The most instantly noticeable thing on this album is the odd meter. Very few of these songs use conventional time signatures, and almost all have polyrhythms. The band's insane drummer, Tomas Haake, somehow keeps all of the rhythms straight in his mind and pulls this extremely technical drumming job without a hitch. Haake is an incredibly impressive drummer: he displays a perfect balance of timekeeping, technicality, and power.\n\nThe guitarist, Fredrik Thordendal, is also quite talented. Of course, Thordendal is also able to play around the odd time signatures, and oftentimes, breaks in the fast and schizophrenic music will be followed by a strange, atmospheric, warbly guitar solo with an eerie and lucid tone. This is used to great effect, creating an unsettling dissonance within the music.\n\nNow on to the music itself: as mentioned several times, the songs have seldom-used rhythms and precise timekeeping. The music is a blend of thrash, industrial, and progressive metal. This style is accompanied by harsh and loud vocals, and it's easy to imagine the singer (Jens Kidman) running toward you with a knife and screaming just as he does on this record. The verses and intros to most of the songs are loud, fast, and grinding, with calm but intentionally jarring breaks in between. The album, as said before, is rife with hypnotic solos that add greatly to the mood of the album.\n\nFinally, I'll get the bad out of the way. There is only one thing really wrong with this album: after 25 or 30 minutes of angry industrial thrashing and shouting about robots taking over the world, all the songs seem to blend together and it's hard to discern which is which. It gets repetitive. That's pretty much all that's really bad about this album, but the great and totally original music definitely outweighs the repetitiveness. Chances are, you already know of Meshuggah and either have/don't want this album, but if you're undecided, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nHighlights include Future Breed Machine, which sounds like a subway crashed into a crowd of babies; Soul Burn, the best example of their polyrhythmic insanity, and Acrid Placidity, a testament to their atmospheric abilities.\n\nLowlights include pretty much the whole rest of the album. It's most definitely not bad, but isn't as discernibly excellent as the three tracks listed above.\n",
        "\nTo be completly upfront, this was the heaviest CD I had ever bought when I got it about 3 years ago. In the present, I have found other Meshuggah to be heavier, but this still gets quite a few listens in my player due to the overall quality of the songs that are present. Some of my favourite Meshuggah songs on are on here, including the ever-popular Future Breed Machine and the single Transfixion. The band sounds as tight as a virgin, with crushing riffs and surprisingly enjoyable solo breaks. The songs also evolve as they play, and go through different phases, a good example would be Future Breed Machine, which has the high guitar part as an intro, then into the typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus progression, but then the song takes a 180 degree turn into a slower riff and a solo, then into a slower chugging guitar part. This is a perfect example of most of Meshuggah's music (with the possible exception of Nothing), it is unpredictable. \n\nMany of the songs on here have a similar beat, I recently read an interview with Martin Haagstrom in which he states that \"all Meshuggah is 4/4\" which explains this. Despite this, the drum work is very well done, but is overshadowed on the album because of the guitars. However, putting the bass up on a CD player will show the true power of the drums on this album, and how much more it adds. There is one slow, instrumental piece called \"Acrid Placidity\", which is completly different from the rest of the album but is still very well done. Some of the songs have much slower, doomier beats such as Sublevels, which showcases a weird, riff. Soul Burn somewhat follows along these lines, but has faster portions. Transfixion shows the faster, thrashier parts of the album, with it's pounding beat and quick riffs. These few examples are basically what the album sounds like, and show why it can't really be classified into one catogory.\n\nJens Kidman, the singer, has an incredible voice. For screaming, that is. He doesn't really do much in the way of singing, but his screams sound as if he is plastering his lungs on the wall of the studio. Also, his spoken part in Sublevels in really cool too, reminds me of Phil Anselmo on much of the GSTK album. His screams suit the music very well.\n\nIf I had to compare Meshuggah to another band, I would say Strapping Young Lad, because they are technical, fast, brutal and unpredicatable. The only real fault of this album is that the songs can get boring after a while. Still a great album nonetheless. If nothing else, MAKE SURE to check out Future Breed Machine.\n",
        "\nWarning, if insane works of art bother or scare you please don't listen to this cd. It's like a nail bomb going off in your head puncturing your brain tissue. Drummer Tomas Haake yet again proves his brilliance. Tomas actually recorded this whole cd without any guitar scratch tracks or a click track. Just him, his drums, and his brain to keep time!!! I will be head bangging to New Millenium Cyanide Christ until the day I die!!! The opening riff is insane, and I have no idea how they came up with that. THE MOUTH LICKING WHAT YOU'VE BLED has to be one of the heaviest, most insane sounding songs ever. The middle part of the song is increadible how they layer the guitar and drum patterns. Sane is another great song. Elastic is my favorite on the album. It has such a unique sound to it. This cd is just increadible any way you look at it. The production could have been a little better. Too much high end and the drums tend to get lost in the mix at times. I highly recomend picking this cd up along with their Destroy Erase Improve cd. All hail Meshuggah!!!!!\n",
        "\nMost of the songs might sound too similar but if you follow the beat of that hard hitting guitar sound, you'll be able to tell the difference from each song. Also those tweeky sounding solos that come up help distinguish the songs from each other by creating a different atmospehere. \n\nWhen other bands try too hard to sound heavy they sound generic but Meshuggah manages to only sound like themselves, creating their own identity in the big vast metal scene. They have their own unique heavyness in their brand of extreme mathematicaly timed music. \n\nThe guitars sound like jackhammers, hitting fast and stopping for less then a second to start hitting again. Nice brutal sounds. The lyrics are interesting, the track, \"New Millenium Cyanide Christ\", talks about Jesus Christ being a cyborg or something. My favorite song from the album.\n\nThe vocals throughout the album are the same fierce shouts but there is one track that sounds like a little creature is talking real fast, \"The Exquisite Machinery of Torture\", the one song that sticks out from the rest.\n\nMeshuggah is one of my favoirte bands and this the one album I got an actual copy of. This and Destroy Erase Improve are the best albums they got, everything else they did I could go without listening, their other CD's are mediocre. \n\nMy grade for Chaosphere, 85%, it's a superb album but I still kind of feel like I'm listening to the same song over and over after listening to the album hundreds of times already. Good stuff though.\n\nOne other band that sounds like this is Ion Dissonance, just check them out if you really dig Meshuggah in this album.\n",
        "\nThis is an EP that was released after Destory Erase Improve. It contains Sane (which would appear in a different form on Chaosphere), 3 versions of Future Breed Machine (the best tech-metal song ever) and 2 strange techno pieces.\n\nFirst of all, I don't *ever* listen to the techno songs, so I won't really count them in part of the review, except to say that they are what is stopping this EP from getting a 95. Sane is a heavy motherfucker of a song, which consists of the typical Meshuggah screaming and the techincal riffage with a cool chorus to boot. Next up is Future Breed Machine (live). Not much to say about it, other than that it is amazing (just like the album version). They do it perfectly live.\n\nOk. Hold your breath. The next song (Future Breed Machine (Mayhem version)) gets my vote for the heaviest song ever. EVER. PERIOD. Basically a long SLLOOWW version of the original, with a few different riffs. The difference is the singing. WOW. I bet Jens' lungs were plastered on the studio wall after that one.\n\nThe next song is FBM (Campfire Version), which is good to listen to as a joke. Very well done.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent EP, with the 3rd track being worth the entire price of admission.\n",
        "\nThis is the most solid Meshuggah album. It takes everything they do well and throws it together to make an insanely agressive, technical, brutal album. \nThe first thing you hear when you listen to this album is a barrage of staccato riffs and Haake's godly drumming going all over the place. Then, Jens breaks in with his vicious voice and shit just rolls on. Fredrik Thordendal (AKA God) pulls out a solo that sounds like R2D2 on crack.\nThen, the best song of the album, New Millenium Cyanide Christ comes in. This is where Tomas Haake shines with his lyrical writing abilities. Although the lyrics on this song aren't as complicated, they have a clever side to them that finalize the song. This is most likely Meshuggah's best song ever.\nI could go on about some of the other songs, but out of lack of energy, I'll just have to leave some of the album to your imagination. \nSome other notable tracks are \"The Exquisite Machinery Of Torture\" which is like an experience all in itself. Definitely a different song.\nAnd finally, the final track on the album, Elastic, which kicks mondo ass. Plus, the solo may very well be one of the best Meshuggah have also done. It's very jazzy.\n\nAll in all, if you're a Metalhead who likes a little technicality with his brutality and wants to try something out of the ordinary, Chaosphere is your album. \nHowever, if you're a sissy or a female, or just some asshole Elitist who refuses anything out of his specific genre, you'll probably barf on this album.\n",
        "\nExtreme. Chaosphere is a departure from all rules of music and song structuring.\n\nThe album is dense, obscure and totally un-natural. There is so much going on in there that at a certain point it gets annoying or cacophonous. And that is exactly what drove my attention into it. How these guys came out with these songs, I just don't know. I always thought that it is not easy to drive emotions, whichever they are, onto music. This albums proves my opinion wrong. And these guys were really angry.\n\nYou can find lots of new elements in Chaosphere. The groove from \"None\" and \"DEI\" is gone. There are no more regular time bars mixed in. The vocals become an instrument, odd meters take over confronting all rythm patterns and the riffs are not present by themselves as guitar driven parts, but they are an integral part of the songs, a part of the whole \"mess\".\n\nAlso, the entire concept is dark and depressive. In-your-face vocals, the balanced mix with all the instruments present and the highly compressed production just adds another dimension the the sound of the band, making it even less-accesible for the regular (or average) metal listener.\n\nI don't even know if I can call this progressive, since it has lots of characteristic elements that help define Meshuggah's own style. \n\nAnd since any other band, so far, sounds like this, I think this album is another huge step in ther musical evolution. It is a hard album to listen to, but once you understand a small part, it's all downhill from there.\n",
        "\nI don't understand why people like these guys, all this album is, is a bunch of dudes trying to act tuff and play heavy music as heavy as they can forgetting that good song writing is needed to make good music. I mean, don't get me wrong, if these guys were in a tuff guy contest, they would win, I mean there so tuff! Just listen to their music, they are so tuff they don't even need to learn how to play their instruments well, learn how to write songs, play melodies, riffs, solo's, drum fills, and bass lines! Oh and I almost forgot....they don't even need to learn how to sing they are so tuff, they can just scream into the microphone because they are tuff guys and no one is going to tell them they are horrible mucisians.\n\nSerisoly though, this album is quite horrible, perhaps Meshuggah (what a stupid band name) has gotten better since this recording, as of now I haven't heard their new stuff. The first thing that is horrible on this album is perhaps the biggest problem, is the songwriting. Most every song starts out with this crappy noise, then some powercord guitar repeated over and over again, their is practically no structure to be found on this album. I heard maybe one or two solo's. The band sounds like they are all playing different songs at the same time, very in choherant and unstructured.\n\nThe guitars are just repeated power cords, no riffs, few solo's, and way to distorted, they sound like noise most of the time. Then other times Meshuggah attemps to be melodic, but that just sucks....they do do that better though.\n\nThe vocals sound like the singer is panicing, or being tortured and screaming nonsense, absolutly horrible. The vocals are by far the worst sounding part of this album, and thats saying alot since the guitars are quite horrible and its hard to imagine whats worse than them.\n\nThe drums are random as hell, no sctructure to them, and often sound like they have nothing to do with the rest of the music and songs. Is there a bass?????\n\nThis is defintaly the worst heavy/metalcore album I have ever heard. The only advice I can give to these guys is to destroy and erase this album, and Improve your sound. I pity all those who like this and own this album. I would give this album a zero, but there are one or two parts which it redeems itself for about 3 seconds, so I will give it some points.\n",
        "\nLong before Meshuggah was known for their robotic-sounding cyber metal, long before their breakthrough success, Destroy Erase Improve, long before gangsta-rapping over power chords was considered metal, this intrepid band was playing speed metal blantantly derivative of their forefathers, such bands as Metallica and Testament. Those days may be gone, but fortunately the metal world has been blessed with a three-song snapshot of their embryonic sound.\n\nThe question that comes to mind is, \"why do we want to hear some inexperienced jabronies playing Metallica covers??\".\n\nGood question.\n\nThe remarkable thing about Meshuggah's debut EP is that it is not fully derivative but includes glimpses of their future in the form of their odd time signatures and exotic lead scales. To those who like Meshuggah's ideas but do not think that a song should be dependent upon them, these three songs are a treat.\n\nTo be sure, this is 80s thrash/speed metal. Jens and Tomas sing in the half-shouted but still tuneful way that James Hetfield and Chuck Billy did in the 80s. The guitars chug along, churning out riffs more discernable than anything from their later years. Furthermore, this album was made before Meshuggah decided that hooks and choruses were untr00, ergo the listener will remember how the song goes an hour later.\n\nDespite the trappings of thrash metal, Meshuggah demonstrates they have always been creative. There are a few sections here and there using odd time signatures, and the complex drum rhythms to match, and their use of dynamics and tempos is present, if underdeveloped. The opaque lyrics are another giveaway of whom we are dealing with.\n\nWhile the first two songs are merely interesting, one being similar to their material on Contradictions Collapse (and actually re-recorded for it) and the other being unabashed Metallica worship, the third song, \"Debt of Nature\" is worth the price of admission alone. Free of the awkward feel of the first two tracks, it is a forgotten thrash classic with a huge chorus and even more immense riffs.\n\nThe downside to this EP is that because of its age, the production is quite dated and dulls the impact the music could have had (although, the production is still miles ahead of that on And Justice for All). Instead of re-releasing these tracks on their Rare Trax CD, they should have re-recorded them and really come up with something that would grab the metal world by the balls. Nonetheless, these songs have a place in metal history, if not as great headbangers, then as prototypes for a metal revolution.\n",
        "\nMeshuggah isn't for everyone. To those who do find technical and odd time signatures, polyrythms, and almost no melody enticing, then this is a pure treat. Amazing guitars, insane drums, great screaming, and overall craziness(hence the name) are all over this album. These guys can truly make something special. I don't know how many fucking times I've heard \"HuHuh CHug CHug this is shitty 1 don't understand teh noize\". It truly does piss me off that so many people dismiss such a great band because they \"don't get it\". Meshuggah deserve much more praise than that. They are eons ahead of horse feces like Cannibal Corpse.\n\nAll of the songs here are fantastic. \"Concatenation\" took weeks to decipher everything that is going on. \"New Millenium Cyanide Christ\" is my second favorite Meshuggah song behind \"Future Breed Machine\".\"The Mouth Licking What You've Bled\" has very complex riffage going on as does \"Sane\". My only nitpick with this album is that \"Elsatic\", while a great song, should have been longer, possibly 10 minutes or more to fill up that space.\n\nOverall, great album. Mandatory pick-up if you are a fan of technical/extreme metal \\m/\n",
        "\nI am a fan of extreme metal. I like brutality. I also like ability to play. I picked this album up for the customary $14.99 at Best Buy, and took it home hoping to hear something truly mind boggling. What i got was, yes, skull crushing...but skullcrushing in a sense of \"what the hell did i just buy.\" Pondering why i would ever have picked this album up.\n\nSince purchasing this album, I have come to the resonable conclusion thatMeshuggah is likely the epitome of overdramatiscized talent sniffing More at, the bastion for people who want to listen to things they think contain talent, and only for that reason. This album literally bored me to tears. This technicality i have heard so much about seemed to pull this album into a vast monotonous chug, which assaulted my very serotonin levels and nearly put me to sleep. \n\nHow a band could ever pull such an abomination off, and not be labeled nu metal is beyond me. Complex timings? Skullcrushing Breakdowns? Fusion??! I have heard/seen all such descriptions of Meshuggah based ENTIRELY on this album, and unlike the previous reviewer, i have yet to see something noteworthy about this (or any other meshuggah albums for that matter.).\n\nThese complex timings my ears and eyes are so fond of being informed about, virtually do not exist on this album. I point to songs such as \"Corridor of Chameleons\" and \"New Millenium Cyanide Christ\" and a few other tracks that are not even worth mentioning. These complex timings seem to only exist to their fans attempting to create a reason to like this band. I hear nothing but basic pattern drumming that all bands have done at one time or another, with the occasional change which for any other band would be considered a \"fuck up\" in playing. \n\nSkullcrushing breakdowns? A term i have only heard in description of this album, And i wonder if i am sure of what a breakdown is, as my skull has yet to be crushed, and i am left with a sense of \"Coal chamber mixed with pantera, bred with static x\" on this (and all) of their releases. If any fan of this band can point out a \"skullcrushing breakdown\" to me, E mail me at [email\u00a0protected] with the exact point in the song and what song it is in.\n\nFinally, the Fusion question. I am still in the dark as to what kind of fusion is happening on this (or any of their) album(s). I fail to sense anything more than sacrificing dynamics for \"technicality\". Is it Jazz? there is literally no jazz fusion. Nothing even remotely jazzlike comes up in this album. Is it techno? Since when do we infuse a genre with impeccable dynamics, and credibility with a genre of vast monotony? I see no fusion here of any positive kind.\n\nOverall, my rating of this album obvisouly reflects my view on the band as well. Chaosphere (The battle standard of Meshuggah fans, it would seem) has shown to me, that Metal truly can delude itself with ideas of false talent, and monotonous \"chug\" riffing.\n\nOne parting question to Meshuggah fans: Is unvarying sound, sacrificing dynamics, and making it \"technical\" a true source of talent? Or is it merely a desire to be original? Good day.\n",
        "\nI originally bought Chaosphere in late 2000... and hated it. I could rarely sit through the entire album, and regretted paying $15 for it. All of the songs sounded the same, without any variation. But as time has passed, I've grown to appreciate it more and more. \n\nThe technicality is truly astounding, outshining--by and large--the entire metal genre. Thordendahl and Haake are among the top performers at their respective instruments (guitars, drums), and the remaining members are more than competent. The bass playing is more evident than on most metal albums, and along with the guitars it creates one, huge, crunching rhythm, while Haake often blasts away in a different time signature on his kit. Kidman's vocal lines tie in with the music better than just about any album I can think of, although I can't describe it as well as I would like. He stresses syllables on words on certain drum hits, and lots of small things like that, which make for a very technical vocal performance, something not often seen in extreme metal.\n\nAnd last but not least, perhaps the most impressive part of the album are Thordendahl's absolutely impossibe, out of this world, fusion-esque leads. They create a climax for each song, and don't feel out of place or tacky. If you play guitar or have knowledge of how it is played, listening to these leads is reason enough to buy the album.\n"
