        "\nTypically, EPs don't put much of a dent into a band's catalogue. (Queensryche and I'm The Man notwithstanding.) They usually consist of some live tracks or okayish studio recordings, all wrapped up and released so the band keeps your attention. However, this particular EP feels good enough to be justified as its own release. I say that because the sound here is so unique. These four tracks are a kind of prog-folk-country-metal stew that is hella tasty. \n\nThe leads on this EP really set the mood. They feature Brent's trademark country tinge, but are moody enough to have a unique identity. While the country-ness typically creates a really uppety atmosphere in Mastodon's other releases, it does the opposite here. The vocals are also expertly used here. Brann's voice in the verses of Blue Walsh are right at home, creating a really cool and cozy atmosphere. And then, mixed with Troy and Brent's melodies in the heavier chorus, the contrast is very well executed. Using Troy on Toe to Toe's dramatic verses is also fits well. \n\nInstrumentally, the EP is top notch. It almost feels as if all of the member's influences sync perfectly here. It doesn't really shift around in focus much, instead keeping to the straight and narrow. As mentioned before, the stew of genre this EP features is just so effective. \n\nSo, why is this EP (and its vocals) so important? Listening to this before around when it came out, I thought it was a really cool slice of music. Now, AFTER Hushed And Grim, it just makes me scratch my head. On that album, the band goes for a softer edge, with mixed results. This EP is so important because it displays what Softodon could be. It's certainly not their most metal moment; it's almost a complete opposite to their first two EPs. Yet, it's so well executed that it doesn't need to be metal. The reason why I point out the vocals is because HAG went all Brann, all the time. Here, each vocalist is used in a way that feels most appropriate. If they put out these four tracks again with six or seven other similarly focused songs, the result would probably be a way better version of Mastodon's softer side.\n",
        "\nAfter listening to \u201cHushed and Grim\u201d for over 16 hours I can safely say I\u2019m satisfied with it, even though it\u2019s no opus magnum of Mastodon (hopefully it\u2019s yet to come).\n\nApparently, as I\u2019ve read in some reviews, there is some \u201creal life\u201d background to this album. Well, I\u2019m too old to have time to follow this kind of nonsense. Apart from that I simply don\u2019t care. At the end it\u2019s me and the headphones. Whatever happened has no relevance and music eventually becomes whatever the listeners make out of it.\n\nMost fans will get their share of enjoyment out of this album. All the trademarks of Mastodon are present: progression, interesting compositions, moody arrangements, and a nice mixture of slower and faster paced moments that make for some nice variety. It doesn\u2019t keep me on my toes like \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d did, whether it\u2019s because I\u2019ve heard it all already or because it\u2019s not as good, I can\u2019t really tell.\n\nThe pacing of the album is a bit off, which with a runtime of almost 90 minutes was to be expected. \u201cSkeleton of Splendor\u201d and \u201cDagger\u201d are the biggest misses. They both last for over 5 minutes and build up to nothing. The straightforward and faster paced tracks (\u201cPain with an Anchor\u201d, \u201cTeardrinker\u201d, \u201cPushing the Tides\u201d, \u201cSavage Lands\u201d) make up for this. \u201cHad It All\u201d got me by surprise \u2013 it\u2019s an almost classic rock ballad with a restless solo to top it off.\n\nI find the more progressive tracks the most important for any Mastodon album, as they are the ones that make me come back for more. \u201cPain with an Anchor\u201d, \u201cPeace and Tranquillity\u201d, (especially) \u201cGobblers of Dregs\u201d, \u201cEyes of Serpents\u201d and the finishing \u201cGigantium\u201d are all good and competent tracks though they\u2019re not the pinnacle of Mastodon\u2019s creative output.\n\nThe long-lasting transition from metal towards rock is still going on. \u201cHushed and Grim\u201d did not turn that trend around. I find it a bit disappointing, I wouldn\u2019t mind some more metal-riff based moments, which are few and far between. Production is as always outstanding. Sound is balanced around the guitars. I find it to be a little bit too soft and rounded \u2013 but that\u2019s the way it's been since \u201cOnce More 'Round the Sun\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t mind some sharper and rougher edges. I don\u2019t like the way the album got released - digisleeve is a piece of shit. Just give me my jewel case and I\u2019m fine.\n\nAll in all, it\u2019s a satisfying album. A bit bloated but not overindulgent. I can see myself returning to it and enjoying it as it is.\n",
        "\nMastodon is a band that I got into before I ventured into melodeath and the vast expanse of metal past nu metal, alternative metal, and bits of metalcore and prog here and there, probably in 2014 or 2015. Although Crack the Skye used to have my vote for my favorite Mastodon album, it's since fallen out of favor for me, with Blood Mountain taking its crown. In fact, I was mildly put off but also incredibly in awe of how heavy and abrasive Blood Mountain was on my first eight or so listens, and I wish I could have that feeling back. But I'm no Mastodon purist or middle period connoisseur. In fact, Emperor of Sand is just about tied with or *slightly* under Blood Mountain in my rankings for completely different reasons. The one commonality they have is that they both not only have that distinct Mastodon character, each and every melody, riff, segment, and vocalist on each section were all crafted with the utmost care. There was a fervor, a flame that the band had. Hell, I even like Once More Around the Sun and would argue that even though it has its low points, it has the same makings of a Mastodon album that every other album shares. Can't exactly say the same for The Hunter, but I'm more about praising the band in this section.\n\nBut why am I bringing all of that up? Well, that's because it just doesn't apply to Hushed and Grim. The fervor isn't there, the flame is out, the care, while present, doesn't translate to much, and worst of all... Hushed and Grim is repetitive and boring. It is drab and dull, and these are things that one would never think when it comes to a Mastodon album. Hell, even The Hunter had that fire, even if it was a total misfire. What the fuck happened?\n\nWell, I'm gonna go and disagree with a sentiment that the other review has. I don't think that the album suffers *because* it's so long (Though that is still a big problem here), it suffers because the writing is simply... Mediocre, aside from a few instances where there's either a glimmer of hope or a surprisingly wonderful gem. However, because there are fifteen tracks in which all but three are either five or six minutes long (With that third exception being eight minutes long), these moments are even fewer and further between than they would typically be. So those are the first two big problems. A personal third problem I have is that it feels like Brent is mostly absent here. Aside from \"More Than I Can Chew\", \"The Beast\" and one other song in the back half, none of the tracks really feel like they have his style at all. That, and he only does vocals on *two* tracks. These days, the older albums feel a bit strange to listen to without Brann's vocals, but his phenomenal drumming is always present to help him feel right at home, so it never feels like the band's without him. The band feels like a family, even in the most primitive of their days, and here... That family is simply incomplete. Not to mention, this could be counterbalanced by the fact that Brent did harsh vocals (And cleans, but you know) and Troy did clean vocals, providing a nice contrast- Two distinct flavors. Brann's and Troy's vocals simply don't provide that kind of a contrast which always helped to create an even more dynamic final product. Even then, even without feeling like Brent continued as much here, this could still be fine if the writing was good- If anything, it could still feel special because it's so different, but still good. Instead, we got something completely lackluster.\n\nThe only songs I ever go back to are \"Teardrinker\", \"Pushing the Tides\", \"Peace and Tranquility\", and \"Had It All\". I occasionally go back to \"Sickle and Peace\" and \"The Beast\", and if the entirety of \"More Than I Could Chew\" was as good as the last minute or two, I'd absolutely love it. Unfortunately, that just isn't the case. Nothing is egregiously bad, but very little stands out in the entire hour and a half slog, and it's all in the middle. This means that I go in wanting to just put the album down, and then when I'm finally enjoying it, it dips back down in quality, and I end up leaving disappointed. Another thing that makes the songs stand out less is that at least two thirds of them just go with a verse/chorus structure that always has Brann doing the choruses. Make no mistake, he's a fantastic vocalist, but previous albums had him more in moderation than this. Maybe it's just egregious because it's more songs in general. In fact, none of the actual performances are the issue. Everybody sings well (Troy is notably fantastic on this album), and everybody plays well. The production is excellent as well. It's just the writing that's so drab, which is the most unforgivable flaw to have for me.\n\nThe theme of the album is about death, which is always a fascinating central focus. The main issue here is twofold. Firstly, it's tackled in a way that just isn't that interesting. Yes, it's incredibly personal to them, but that's rarely ever conveyed well here. \"Dagger\" and \"Had It All\" are incredible exceptions to this, as the lyrics there actually are, well, good and clear in that regard. The second problem is that they already tackled the subject on Emperor of Sand, and it was done much better both musically and with its narrative. In fact, this goes back to being an album without a central narrative or story, at least a fictional one. If you want to argue semantics, yes, the narrative is about the band with Nick John, which was undoubtedly a loss that could never truly be conveyed. However, there is no story or narrative being told from beginning to end here like on most Mastodon albums. Even then, I can cut them some slack, considering how Emperor of Sand tackled it pretty much perfectly. There was never going to be a way to come close to Emperor's level of storytelling on the same subject.\n\nI know I've been harsh, but I did just give it my second listen, and unfortunately, things were different between my first and second listen. The first time I went through the album was on Halloween morning. I slogged through it, liking the songs I listed here, and I pretty much didn't care for everything else at all. Back then, I probably would've given it a 45-50%. However, probably just a couple of hours after, my mother passed away. It changed how I saw the entirety of the album, most notably \"Had It All\", which I went from enjoying quite a bit and feeling a strange connection to feeling like there was something truly haunting about it to me in specific. It's a song that hurts on a level that I'm not really okay with, but I've come to fall in love with it because of that. It's the song that I was listening to when I got the news that she passed, and it always takes my mind back to that very moment. In that respect, listening to the song is rather overwhelming. And considering that the album is about the death of the closest, most special person in one's life, I guess I understand it a little bit more. \n\nIn that respect, I *want* to fall in love with this album as much as everyone else does. I've seen many, many people rave about this album, most notably respected musicians like Mikael Stanne, who claimed it to be the \"Definitive album of the year/pandemic\". I can see some truth in that, as it's mostly boring as shit with some truly special, introspective speckles that show glimmers of a wonderful album. And I need to be clear that I'm all for slow albums. I love Slow Motion Death Sequence by Manes. Whoracle, while a bit slower-paced for the band, is an excellent In Flames album. Heart Like a Grave's slower, more vulnerable moments are the best parts of the album. I'm all for Deafheaven's slower, more brooding moments, particularly those on New Bermuda. I'm even for longer albums. Although it's not a really extensive album, Winter's Gate by Insomnium is basically just one 40 minute track, but it's dynamic and awesome. For me, the music just needs to be good. And if it's not good, it just at least needs to be interesting. Hushed and Grim rarely held my interest. It barely held my interest enough to give \"Had It All\" its own segment, and I have a huge personal connection to that song. If you've heard a newer Mastodon album, just imagine that but boring and incredibly long, so I guess The Hunter minus any flavor, even if this album is still on par with it. That's Hushed and Grim. That's it. In fact, Hushed and Grim is a very passive take on the subject matter, and it leaves it void of much of a conveyed connection. Knowing the story about Nick John's history with the band enriches the album a ton, but if you don't know it's about him, well... It almost feels detached. And that's just disappointing. The album feels helpless in all the wrong ways.\n\nSongs to Recommend: \"Teardrinker\", \"Pushing the Tides\", \"Peace and Tranquility\", \"Had It All\"\nSongs to Avoid: Honestly, none of them are horrible. Most of them are the same level of mediocre. You'll probably love or hate different songs. \"Pushing the Tides\" is a rather straightforward lead single that you'd expect from them, so for all I know, you may probably hate it. That's completely understandable. I just like it because it's actually interesting and a change of pace. I guess just avoid this album. I'd say listen to it once, just... When you feel like it. It's a long, demanding listen that'll leave you unfulfilled, but it's not bad to the point where I'd say don't listen to it. It's unfortunately barely good enough to where I'd say it's deserving of a listen, but no more than that. You won't enjoy it that much. And if you ever think \"Wow, this is kinda cool!\" or \"Yeah, it's cool that they're tackling death\", just listen to Emperor of Sand instead. It's a hundred times better than this. Hell, even listen to Crack the Skye. I may not love it as much as I used to, but it tackles the subject in both its fictional narrative and about Brann's sister's death much better than this album does.\n\nOne thing is for sure, I will never say that this album is devoid of love. They were clearly passionate about the music, about the loss of their friend, and about trying to make a tribute to him. It just didn't come through at all here. I respect the musicians and their efforts much more than I do the final product here. I have no doubt that they're grieving, and I really do feel for them. But man, does the music very rarely make me feel much of anything at all. I'd like to hope that the next album is better than this, and that I can just laugh to myself looking back at what I feel is a massive, repetitive misfire.\n",
        "\nThe metal world was waiting with anticipation for this album. After completing the series of albums dedicated to four elements, what were the four Mastodon weirdos up to? Going back to the roots? Getting a fresh new start? Combining the extreme and the prog elements? Something else?!\n\nThe band themselves announced a mixed bag of an album. We have some classic rock songs, some really brutal death metal tunes and one or two completely different, eerie tracks, Brann or Troy were quoted saying earlier in 2011. Having listened to the album, I wonder whether they were intentionally teasing with us or did the songs undergo such changes that, as a result, The Hunter sounds very coherent, even though in a different way than Crack the Skye.\n\n\u201cBlack Tongue\u201d opens the album, followed by \u201cCurl of the Burl\u201d \u2013 two songs that have been known for some time. These two tunes give a good idea what Mastodon sounds like AD 2011. Less angry, more relaxed, with less breakdowns and rhythm changes, more focused on the lead riff and more melody oriented than ever before. One thing that stays intact is the signature sound \u2013 once you hear it, you know it\u2019s the Atlanta quartet. Perhaps on The Hunter it\u2019s less in-your-face, but as I said before, this is a laidback record. Deal with it.\n\nFurther exploration of the album brings adolescent outburst of energy (I wanna drink some fucking blood/I wanna break some fucking glass \u2013 \u201cBlasteroid\u201d) and contemplation of astral sex (\u201cStargasm\u201d). The heart of the album pays tribute to the lighter side of Crack the Skye, with low testosterone and lots of beautiful vocal lines (\u201cAll The Heavy Lifting\u201d, \u201cThickening\u201d) and droning guitars (title track). \n\nThe biggest surprise comes in form of \u201cCreature Lives\u201d, slow stalking piece with Brann\u2019s delicate vocals like a cherry on the pie. Two heavy (and good) songs (\u201cSpectrelight\u201d and \u201cBedazzled Fingernails\u201d) placed one after another toward the end of the album seem to be shouting we still have the balls, just disn\u2019t feel to wave them around all the time. But the best is to come \u2013 you have to hear \u201cThe Sparrow\u201d yourself, I can\u2019t describe how beautiful it is. What a way to end the record!\n\nThe Hunter shows Mastodon\u2019s more relaxed (and lighter) side, there is no doubt about it. Lots of people will miss growling (almost extinct on the this record), brutality and complicated rhythms. Who will love it then? Those able to appreciate artists like Neurosis, Minsk, Rwake, Isis \u2013 there are moments when Mastodon come close to the atmospheric droning prog music played by those bands, but with one significant difference: most songs on The Hunter don\u2019t drag for 10 minutes. In fact, none of them does \u2013 the average duration is around 4 minutes, so the risk of dozing off to these tunes is minimal. \n\nFinal word? It\u2019s still Mastodon, I can hear them in almost every track. They haven\u2019t lost their identity, just played it out differently this time. They must have needed to relax this time and guess what: so did I. I am really glad the way they worked it out. Now, where\u2019s my acid strip?\n\nP.S. The bonus DVD that comes with the digipack version in European edition of The Hunter is not as great as the one that was added to Crack the Skye. But it does contain some interesting material:\n- track by track commentary (by Brann Dailor, 10-minutes long)\n- the making of The Hunter \n- video clip for \u201cBlack Tongue\u201d\n- video clip for \u201cDeathbound\u201d (non-album track!)\n- psychedelic visualizer for \u201cStargasm\u201d\n",
        "\nUS prog metal big shots Mastodon just released their eight LP, a nearly 90-minute double-album whammy titled Hushed and Grim. I have been following the band since their 2009 breakthrough Crack the Skye and I enjoyed all releases since then, so my anticipation for the new album, that had been described as darker and more progressive than anything before, was high. Alas, my expectations were quickly disappointed after I gave the new record a couple of spins. After sitting with it for over a week, I can confidently say that Hushed and Grim is a strong contender for my personal \u201cbiggest let-down of 2021\u201d, perhaps only second to Steven Wilson\u2019s The Future Bites. So what went wrong?\n\nIn an interview to UK magazine PROG, drummer Brann Dailor introduced the album by saying: \u201cWe could only get it down to 15 songs. We had multiple listens at my house and those 15 songs just felt like they needed to be together. To whittle it down to 55 minutes, our usual sweet spot, we would have had to get rid of six or seven songs and it wasn\u2019t happening.\u201d. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the mother of all problems with this album. The band and renowned producer David Bottrill (Peter Gabriel, King Crimson, Tool) decided to take an \u201ceverything goes\u201d and \u201cmore and more\u201d approach to songwriting and album production, which on the surface may seem to push the \u201cprogressive\u201d ambitions of Mastodon\u2019 music, but it ultimately greatly harms its listenability. \n\nThe main problems of the album for me are direction and consistency. This album does not have either. Its 15 tracks move back and forth between dark alternative rock/metal, spacey progressive metal and remnants of the more sludgy and metallic sound from the band\u2019s origins, without deciding which sonic identity to give to the music. Do not get me wrong, I love albums that incorporate a set of diverse influences into the sound. But this requires careful arrangements to balance the various ingredients into the music. Here the driving approach seems to have been to just let the different influences surface at different points of a song, or in different songs, without worrying too much about how these may flow into one another. The end result is a collection of songs that are yes diverse, but also feel somewhat schizophrenic and directionless, moving back and forth between the various styles without managing to settle on a sensible compromise or achieving a satisfying amalgam. In other words, the album stutters rather than flowing gracefully, and this makes for a rather uncomfortable and frustrating listening experience.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of examples of this across the 15 songs of the album. \u201cPain with an Anchor\u201d is an interesting opener, introducing influences from modern dark rock/metal bands like Katatonia or A Perfect Circle, that I would not have expected to hear on a Mastodon album, but the following track \u201cThe Crux\u201d immediately reverts expectations, harking back towards the heavier and spacey metallic sounds of Once More 'Round the Sun. The album seems to settle on this groove for a couple of tracks, before \u201cThe Beast\u201d confusingly throws in some incongruous bluesy sections to bookend what is otherwise a fairly standard piece of atmospheric progressive metal. Meanwhile \u201cSkeleton of Splendor\u201d and the single \u201cTeardrinker\u201d return to the mellow alternative vibes of the opening track, before \u201cPushing the Tides\u201d veers again towards a heavier sound. The second disc pretty much continues in this ambivalent vein, almost as if Mastodon were undecided between embracing the new alternative rock/metal sound and sticking with their more traditional heavy sound. \n\nWhile flow is a characteristic that I find very important in a full-length album, I could have forgiven the album\u2019s deficiency in this department if Hushed and Grim were consistently high quality across its 15 songs. Alas, it is not. The album is crammed with mediocre material that should have absolutely been filtered out. \u201cThe Crux\u201d, \u201cMore than I Could Chew\u201d (which, come to think about it, is a pretty accurate description of how I feel about this record), \u201cThe Beast\u201d, \u201cPushing the Tides\u201d, \u201cSavage Lands\u201d, \u201cEyes of Serpents\u201d are all pretty subpar songs that really do not add much to Mastodon\u2019s extant discography, sounding like a re-hashed version of their earlier material. The frustrating thing is that the filler material severely dilutes the impact that strong tracks like \u201cPain with an Anchor\u201d, \u201cSkeleton of Splendor\u201d, \u201cTeardrinker\u201d, \u201cPeace and Tranquillity\u201d and \u201cGobblers of Dregs\u201d could have made on the listener. All these songs are interesting, some even exciting, but it is excruciating to have to wade through almost an hour of average material to get to listen to the good bits of the album. \n\nMastodon are top notch musicians and the playing throughout Hushed and Grim casts no doubt on this, from Brann Dailor\u2019s frenzied drumming to Brent Hinds\u2019 and Bill Kelliher\u2019s dazzling guitar playing, the album brims with excellent musicianship. Where Hushed and Grim falls considerably short, however, is in the songwriting and arrangement department. Ultimately, the combo of lack of direction and watered down tracklist was definitely a killjoy for me and I do not see myself returning to this record anytime soon. I nevertheless choose to believe that this is just a blip in Mastodon\u2019s impressive discography and I remain hopeful and looking forward to the band\u2019s next move. \n\n[Originally written for The Metal Observer]\n",
        "\nI will review the album for its merits because something needs to be said here to balance out some of the nonsense on here. This album is truly one of the best albums ever recorded, in any genre - and, I will boldly stand by that statement. I made the statement many years ago when the album was first released, and I will make the statement again, today. This album stands the test of time. Very few albums can do that, and the ones that do are considered timeless classics.\n\nFrom the opening track, \"Oblivion\", which has a unique, dark, bluesy feel, to the 2nd track, \"Divinations\", which has an epic, progressive, but rocking feel to it, with atonal undercurrents, the album lets you know right out of the gate that it is complex, emotional, diverse, and powerful. From beginning to end, this album does not relent in its technicality, its emotion, or its ability to carry the listener on its magical, heavy metal journey. And, the last song, \"The Last Baron\" feels like a crescendo to end this triumphant, but sad, magical journey of sorts. All these years later, this album never gets old. It's like an old friend that I welcome warmly to my ears.\n\nThe musicianship on this album is also worth recognizing, as it is both technically impressive, and extremely well written. These are memorable songs that will not let go once they take hold, and you can feel the emotion in the song-writing. Layers of complex, weaving guitars, drum fills, and meandering bass, compliment each other in a harmonious, complete work. Not only does each song showcase Mastodon's songwriting, but each song is a lesson in musicianship, showcasing some very technical playing ability from the entire band.\n\nThis album is not for the impatient Heavy Metal fan that seeks immediate satisfaction, which is why I think it has not sat well with some reviewers. Yes, it does not offer the punch of thrash riffage that other bands may present to the listener. But, to the patient listener, who is willing to go on this journey with Mastodon, this album may just sink its teeth into your soul. And, this is where this album really shines as a masterpiece. It is like a fine wine that can only be fully appreciated by a connoisseur. If you are that wine drinker, you may just find this as the masterpiece it is.\n",
        "\nGiven how much of their career Mastodon have spent refining, polishing, smoothing out and mellowing out their sound, it's pretty jarring going from any of their post-Crack the Skye material to anything they before that album. That said even sticking to their early career, this still sounds wild and unhinged next to the still much more refined Leviathan, say. Remission is the sound of a hungry and ambitious band with a decent amount of experience on their respective instruments, and in many ways is a peak performance in their lengthy career. It's not quite their best album overall but it easily contains a lot of their best moments, songs, performances, etc. and still stands as a landmark album for both sludge metal and metal as a whole.\n\nAt this point in their career, Mastodon played a heavy as hell sludge metal sound that they'd already displayed on their previous material, and they really turn it up a notch here and continue to do their sound justice, with the music being even better crafted and performed and some new ideas being attempted. Remission's tracks can be sorted into one of two groups according to their songwriting style - the first consists of generally shorter, more energetic groove/sludge numbers that are essentially a denser, more chaotic and refined version of what was present on their early demos and EPs. The other half meanwhile consists of the longer, more melodic and drawn out progressive/sludge metal numbers with more mellow acoustic/lead-driven sections and sparser vocals. What's consistent throughout the album though is its production, which sounds amazing. The drum kit sounds thunderous and full, the guitar tone is very dense, thick and big, the overall sound of the album is polished and rich and heavy but not too even as to prevent instruments from bleeding together a bit or sanding the music of its abrasion, and the mix lets everything come through clearly. It's another obvious step up from their pre-album material which sounded pretty good but does not compare to the professional and monstrous presentation here.\n\nThere are other elements consistent to both types of song here, one of them being the vocals, which are performed by bassist Troy Sanders and guitarist Brent Hinds. The vocals here are perhaps the strongest of any Mastodon album; while they are inherently less varied as little clean singing is utilised here, the beefy hardcore barks throughout the album are still commanding, aggressive, rapid-fire and powerful, standing up to the grinding, and crushing heaviness of the instrumentation behind them. And then of course there is the drumming, which is probably the most famous aspect of Mastodon's earlier career; hearing these songs, it's easy to see why. Brann's drumming is absolutely frantic; these songs are machine-gunned with bouts of showboating fills and other assorted flashy techniques and patterns. He doesn't forget his role as the timekeeper and rhythmic skeleton of the music of course; and that's perhaps the best thing about his performance. In spite of the technical flair he manages to roll all of his fills into the framework of the music, meaning the drums and guitars never fit together awkwardly as he never throws off the timing of his drumming. Rather than taking away from the music he only adds to the cacophony, dynamics and chaos of the music by interspersing his more restrained moments with fill after fill. For this reason I think it's incorrect to say Brann has no restraint or taste, as I find his drumming in general to be far more tastefully applied than say, Derek Roddy's unending blasting or the constant double bass of some power metal drummers.\n\nAs stated, the shorter songs here are very dense and somewhat chaotic; they're not overtly technical, speedy, dissonant or noisy in the way mathcore or grindcore can be but there is still an emphasis on frequent change-ups in the riffs and drums. The aforementioned excellent drumming from Brann is especially notable on these tracks; he really adds a lot to the chaos, flow and tension of these tracks with his flashy yet tasteful performance. The riffs meanwhile are crushingly heavy, groovy, rapid and percussive with just an undercurrent of melody, locking in perfectly with the drums - from the instantaneously memorable grooves of 'Crusher Destroyer' and 'March of the Fire Ants' (note also the latter's beautiful melodic break halfway through) to the churning of 'Where Strides the Behemoth' to the choppy thrashing of 'Burning Man', a great majority of the guitarwork here hits much harder and is much more memorable than what was on their older material. The riffs really anchor and drive these songs forward, ensuring they become and remain some of most memorable and exciting songs of their entire career, as well as the stronger set of songs on the album.\n\nThe lengthier tracks here are slower, more patient, droning, atmospheric and progressive - and they're easily the less exciting breed of song here, even though they are more indicative of their later direction. Whether in isolation or in the context of the album, they're merely solid as opposed to absolutely stunning; they're nice enough while on but they definitely drag the momentum of the more energetic songs down once they start. The rhythm section on these songs is a lot more restrained; the riffs are less technical and choppy, being of the more pure and drawn out sludge variety than anything groovy or thrashy. Brann's drumming is a lot more measured on these songs with fills coming far less frequently and his beats in general being slower to match the slower pacing. They're still some of the better lengthy songs they've written however; with the crushing sludge riffs aided by the big guitar sound driving the songs forward more than anything from Crack the Skye, and the all too sparingly used vocals and technical drumming going with the riffing nicely. Also of note are the more melodic leads and acoustic guitars found in them (this is especially prominent during 'Elephant Man'.) These elements being worked into songs alongside their sludgy sound is predictive of what would come to fruition on Blood Mountain and are some of the better moments on the album in general. That said, it's clear from these songs and most of their later albums that restraint is absolutely not what Mastadon are good at; that the best songs here are no holds barred bangers that throw everything at the wall is not a coincidence.\n\nDespite the inconsistent quality and flow of the tracklist, this is still overall a great album and one of the band's best. The drumming, riffing and vocals are some of the best performances the band would ever churn out, and this still has the best production of any of their albums. The shorter songs are some of their best tracks ever and the longer songs, while weaker, are still pretty good and at least show a band that was willing to try new things and vary up their music. They're also proof that they needn't flush the quality of their music down the toilet by trading in uncompromising heaviness for progression and atmosphere, something they would learn on the next two albums and seemingly unlearn in the years following those. All that aside, this is a very good album; a sludge metal classic that should be heard a few times by any metal fan.\n",
        "\nWhen Mastodon released their second full-length album Leviathan in 2004, there was nothing else like it in mainstream metal. This certainly put them in a good spot to establish a distinct identity, but it sure confused the ever-loving hell out of me as an adolescent. As someone wholly unfamiliar with sludge metal at the time, the comparisons made by media outlets to Metallica and Iron Maiden seemed disingenuous. I couldn\u2019t really lump them in with the Triviums or Killswitch Engages of the era either due to their spontaneous, jammed out nature. I\u2019ve since come around to the ways of Leviathan but for an album that is frequently hailed as an influential 2000s classic, I still think it\u2019s something of a mixed bag.\n\nNo matter how I\u2019ve felt about Mastodon over the years, I\u2019ve always loved their drumming. Boasting a style that somehow crosses Bill Ward\u2019s loose jazziness with Neil Peart\u2019s technical precision, Brann Dailor is one of his generation\u2019s most talented players and this album is the most prominent display of his skills. His off-the-cuff fills and hard-hitting rhythms shape and breathe life into the songs and a keen understanding of dynamics keeps him from completely overshadowing the rest of the band. He goes overboard at times and would understandably tone down his approach on subsequent efforts, but such an unhinged performance is truly something to behold. The guitars manage to hold their own, providing plenty of intricate riffs through a grainy yet watery tone.\n\nSadly, the vocals are rather underdeveloped in comparison. With duties at the time largely split between bassist Troy Sanders and guitarist Brent Hinds, their performances are fairly varied but frequently sound overwhelmed and unconfident. The harsh shouts sound hoarse and come off toothless, especially considering the album\u2019s reliance on ripping sludge, and the clean singing consists of a weird wheeze that is awkwardly endearing. This was also the band\u2019s first album to feature (rely on?) guest vocalists as Clutch\u2019s Neil Fallon bellows the iconic bridge of \u201cBlood and Thunder\u201d and Neurosis\u2019 Scott Kelly trades off on \u201cAqua Dementia.\u201d\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought Mastodon desperately needed a dedicated lead singer. The band had started with one whose name is forever in obscurity (Poor Eric Saner) and the void remains noticeable even after they released 2002\u2019s Remission without him. I remember thinking that this Fallon guy could\u2019ve been really good for them and fifteen years later, I still wonder when they\u2019re going to suck it up and have Kelly sing on a full album already. Thankfully the band would go on to drastically overhaul their multi-vocal format, coming together with beautiful results on 2009\u2019s Crack the Skye. It\u2019s a move that has given them a distinct identity yet wouldn\u2019t have happened if they hadn\u2019t stuck to their guns, growing pains and all. Maybe sometimes doofuses like me just aren\u2019t worth listening to\u2026\n\nThis mixed bag attitude also applies to the album\u2019s songwriting in terms of variety and quality. The tracks are almost evenly divided between abrasive stompers and abstract prog ventures all collected under an appropriately aquatic atmosphere. They are also unified by rather slapdash structuring, resulting in a few off-putting numbers; \u201cIsland\u201d has never sat right with me for whatever reason and I will never unhear the direct rips of Metallica\u2019s \u201cWelcome Home (Sanitarium)\u201d on \u201cMegalodon.\u201d\n\nThat said, you don\u2019t have to dive too deeply to discover the album\u2019s sunken treasures. \u201cBlood and Thunder\u201d has thoroughly earned its iconic status as its transitions ebb and flow in just the right ways and its vocal lines have the perfect amount of shout-along fun. The bludgeoning \u201cIron Tusk\u201d is the best of the beatdowns thanks to its gruff hook and the quirkier vocals on the haunting \u201cSeabeast\u201d and \u201cNaked Burn\u201d do give them a distinct character. The instrumental \u201cJoseph Merrick\u201d also makes for a calming closer, especially coming off the thirteen minutes of \u201cHearts Alive.\u201d\n\nFor all the bipolar sentiments I hold regarding Leviathan, I could never deny the impact that it has made in 21st-century metal. It was a unique album when it first came out and its influence is absolutely massive in the progressive sludge scene that exponentially expanded in its wake. It has its share of flaws, but the great songs and stellar musicianship are enough to at least offset them. I always saw this album\u2019s potential even at my grumpiest and knowing what Mastodon would later achieve has allowed me to view Leviathan with a fresher, more nuanced perspective. I still can\u2019t quite think of it as Mastodon\u2019s Ride the Lightning or a top tier masterpiece, but I certainly understand why so many do.\n\nHighlights:\n\u201cBlood and Thunder\u201d\n\u201cSeabeast\u201d\n\u201cIron Tusk\u201d\n\u201cNaked Burn\u201d\n\nOriginally published at http://indymetalvault.com\n",
        "\nThis album was one of my favorites during my drug-fueled years of the late 2000s to...well...now. While my drug taste, usage, frequency and enjoyment experienced various stages throughout these 13 years, one thing, though, has stayed consistent, if not potenated as the time's gone by, and that is my enjoyment of this masterpiece of an album. It's a psychedelic fueled and inspired journey that pretty much solidified Mastodon on the map as one of the most innovative and unique bands at the time (hence my aforementioned drug use; this album was my go-to album when high, especially on dissociatives such as DXM, but I digress.) It also resulted in a vigorous rise in their popularity, and it's not hard to see why.\n\nSee, this album is both accessible to mainstream tastes but at the same time is just as brutal and death/thrash metal-laden, with some sludge and groove metal thrown in for good measure. It's not \"br00tal\" brutal, but for what it is and how popular it got, it's not some mild metal album (although a couple songs ARE admittedly mellow, but that goes with the theme). Apparently this album was recorded to basically be the musical version of having an acid trip, and was thus recorded with a myraid of psychedelic features and bizarre endings of songs acting as interludes into the next track.\n\nThe music can be best be described with a blanket genre of progressive death/groove metal, but if you're seeking a more concise description, this music is progressive technical death/thrash/groove/sludge metal with hardcore and southern influences. The guitars are very technical when they want to be, such as on the track Capillarian Crest, where there's almost a duel between two extremely technical guitar riffs. \n\nThe band utilizes very out-of-the-ordinary vocal techniques in some songs, such as using a filthy, trippy sounding robotic-esque vocals on the track Circle of Cysquatch. Speaking of vocals, this band has two vocalists, one of whom handles the cleaner, more Southern-sounding vocals and can even croon at times. The second vocalist is the death growler and shouter. His vocals aren't what I'd call death metal, but rather death metal-esque mixed with a thrashy, hardcore-esque scream. Together, they suit the overall style very well. They work in tandem on some songs, while other songs feature either only one of them or primarily one if them.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the guitar work on this album is fantastically technical, with a sludgy yet also clear sound, but sometimes heavily distorted for trippyness. The melodic, dreamy and/or slow songs are often more distorted and accessible, with more progressive elements, while the fast-paced songs are very much more technical and typically thrash and death riff-laden. The bass is also in on the psychedelic party, and it's pretty technical at times, but can suffer from typical inaudible bass syndrome.\n\nOverall, this is an album that should be mandatory for every metal, hard rock and progressive fan. It is a massive mix of genres, and its different array of song types have attracted fans across many corners of the music world. Even if you don't care for every song, there's bound to be one or two that you'll love. My only (very minor) complaint is that the two end tracks are almost pure filler, and almost 30 minutes of filler at that. Cut that shit out and the album suffers NOTHING at all to its overall quality.\n\nBest tracks:\nThe Wolf is Loose\nCrystal Skull\nSleeping Giant\nCapillarian Crest\nColony of Birchmen\n",
        "\nI just recently came across this split 7\" LP at a record store in Italy for a few euros and although this split only contains two songs, I thought it would be a waste not to buy it. This split contains two songs from two of the most iconic progressive/sludge bands today: Mastodon and High on Fire. This split LP came out at the dawn of these two band's career and I find myself asking the following question: \"Who knew that these two relatively small bands (at the time of this release) would go on and achieve such a massive following later on in their career? Although I love both bands, I sort of have a soft spot for High on Fire because they were one of the first sludge bands that I've ever discovered and truly shaped my teenage years, for better or for worse. \n\nOne of the main reasons why I said that High on Fire was one of the definitive bands of my teenage years, is because of this one song of theirs on this split. Although \"Hung, Drawn and quartered\" would become more famous as soon as it was released on an actual full-length, I remember it more for being one of the main songs of the game called \"Tony Hawk's underground\" for the Gameboy Advance. The song starts out with a relatively long drum-roll which prepares the listener for the sonic rape which follows. The song is relatively short, clocking in at less than five minutes, but the whole point of the song gets through the listener very easily and the song goes full-circle very quickly. The atmosphere is very claustrophobic as if the wall of noise the song creates is trying to devour you into oblivion. The tone of the guitars is very noisy, and the bass sounds god-damn destructive and ready for the kill. The drums are quite interesting and are very creative. They're not just there to keep the timing, they're there to add to the whole atmosphere of debauchery and they succeed immensely at that. The vocals sound fucking vicious and they add a whole new dimension of evil intent to the whole song. In my opinion, this song presents the better half of this split. \n\nNow on to the Mastodon half of this split. Mastodon's side consists of the song \"March of the Fire Ants\" which would later find itself on their 2002 album called \"Remission\". Unlike the straightforward nature of High on Fire's offering, Mastodon's song, as to be expected, was a little bit more technical and progressive in nature. The drumming on this song is pretty maniacal and simply frantic and seems to be ready for the god-damn kill. The guitar work is also extremely impressive. This song might not be very riff-oriented, but it has some great melodies which give the listener a certain sense of hope. However, that's soon changed because the song does a full 360-degree turn and becomes a mish-mash of technical riffing and the extremely frantic drumming. Although I really like this song, I find that it lacks the atmosphere created by High on Fire's song. \"March of The Fire Ants\" seems to be abandoning atmosphere for technicality which can sometimes work, but not in this case unfortunately. The mixing is perfect, don't get me wrong, each instrument sounds as it should be which is a very rare thing with bands that have just started out and are still trying to find their sound. And this split is exactly that for Mastodon. In my opinion, this song is a very good atempt at Mastodon trying to find their definitive sound. I might not have enjoyed this part as much as I have enjoyed High on Fire's song, but it damn sure is a great effort. \n\nAll in all, this split is a truly amazing offering, yet extremely brief. However, I do recognize the fact that it was just released to provide a teaser for what was to come for both bands. However, I still think a couple more songs could have been added for each band to actually make the 7\" inch a longer and more pleasurable experience. The fact that most 7\" are usually short in length holds true to this day, however. I belive that anyone who listened to the both band's following full-lengths can might as well just skip through this split LP, because there will be nothing new to listen to. However, for the hardcore fans, such as me, this LP would make a great addition to the collection.\n",
        "\nOriginally, I wanted the title of this review to be some kind of attempt at humor, perhaps something that points out that the White Walker on the cover isn\u2019t actually walking, but to keep people from drawing the wrong conclusion upon seeing the score, some retitling was necessary. If this single was just that, a true single, it would have a perfect score. The regular version of this song is a soft but creeping tune that encapsulates the atmosphere of those scenes in Game of Thrones that hint at some mysterious, ancient evil lurking beyond the Wall about as well as anything possibly could. Unfortunately, \u2018White Walker\u2019 is paired with a lame a capella version of itself I have to include in this review\u2019s score.\n\nThe song proper creeps along, mainly with slow progressions, bordering on simple, ambient folk music. The song is cold, melancholy, and as sparse as the tundra. Drummer/singer Brann Dailor (his first name is Bran with an extra 'n' so it needed to be him on the mic) has a moody resonance that completes the feeling the band aims for. Everything comes together in the first half of the song to emit a spooky, paranoid quality before it builds into a simple but effective solo and a reworking of the song\u2019s ideas but with a beefier instrumental presence that still manages to be just as evocative as the song\u2019s first half.\n\nThe a capella version is much less atmospheric, partly because there are no instruments and partly because the vocals aren\u2019t as resonant. They don\u2019t have that dry, eerie presence to them and you can\u2019t simply ignore this shortcoming by focusing on the instruments because, obviously, there aren\u2019t any. The instruments, it should be noted, are a key piece of the main song\u2019s effective atmosphere and removing them entirely is a huge mistake. There are also some points where Dailor flubs the delivery or unexpectedly raises the volume of his voice, resulting in a few truly painful notes scattered throughout. This track is apparently him rehearsing his vocal lines by singing them into his phone so it\u2019s no surprise that it sounds half-assed and unfinished.\n\nWith the a capella version of \u2018White Walker\u2019 forcing me to bring down this release\u2019s score and potentially giving the wrong impression, I feel compelled to reiterate that the full-bodied version of this song is a deftly-crafted masterpiece of uneasy ambience that gives way to a satisfying, metalized rendition of itself near the end. For an encapsulation of that \u2018lost and alone a hundred miles north of the Wall\u2019 mood, there\u2019s nothing better.\n",
        "\nThe seventh studio album by Mastodon is a concept album based on the concept of time and death, as the title hints. It falls into a more progressive spectrum than their last two efforts. The band works with producer Brendan O'Brien who also appeared with the band in their 2009 album Crack the Skye.\n\nThe lyrical contents of the album are inspired by the fragility of life and how time defines aspects of survival. A story is told once again here in an epic and orderly fashion. The lyrics provide a sense of exploration as the listener finds what the band means by them, and they work even better when interpreted according to the listener. The three vocalists have surely improved on their melodies, and the vocals can be considered as some of the best efforts they have put out in their discography.\n\nMastodon return to their heavy, riff-based roots along with their evergrowing progressive structures. The albums surely contains of a lot of riffs that are heavier than their last albums, and also are more memorable. Songs like Andromeda, Steambreather and Sultan's Curse are classic riffs that the quartet are known to put out. The album is not as technically brilliant as some of their classics, but still possesses a vast construct and feels big enough to listen to. The band has kept the very accessible sound, and combined it with a signature methods. The albums ends with, possibly one of the best song on the record, Jaguar God, which ties up the whole album very satisfyingly. \n\nThe most controversial part of the album is probably the track Show Yourself, in which the band takes a very mainstream approach in its structure, instantly making very catchy and also a subject to some divisions. Although, the song is more relevant when one hears the rest of the album because of its lyrical relevance. The album gets better with each listen, as the themes and story gets explored over time. \n\nOverall, its a good album which reflects more on its concepts and has huge emotional aspects in regards to the ideas portrayed.\n",
        "\nMan, this completely sucks. I'm not sure what I was expecting, as Hunter had a whole bunch of problems, and I never made it through Once More Round the Sun. Suffice to say it's hard to imagine that these were the same guys that made all those cool records \"\"\"\"\"\"back in the day\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\".\n\nEssentially, Mastodon have become really vocal driven, which is far as decisions go is on par with invading Russia in the middle of winter. All their best stuff, Capillarian Crest, all of Crack the Skye, most of Leviathan etc etc was about a bunch of cool guitar lines with a few sludge-ish \"Aged nautical dude\" kinda vocals thrown around to give it a bit of context.\n\nHere, well, we've got a lotta high, kinda whiny, certainly aimless clean vocals- think Josh Homme but a lot worse- over the least interesting guitar parts Mastodon have ever done. The vocals aren't *terrible*, merely annoying, but they just clearly can't write interesting vocal lines or decent choruses to save their lives. I'm not adverse to vocal heavy shit, the black album remains a favourite. But none of the Mastodon dudes sound as good as '91 Hetfield, and certainly none of them have the catchy songwriting chops of 91 Hetfield either.\n\nThings blend into a mush pretty quickly. Vaguely techy guitar part- bunch of pointless vocals- brief jam (man, what happened to the drummer? he's never sounded less interested)- more pointless singing- perhaps a solo or two which no, you won't remember- rinse and repeat. I'm sure it's all fairly hard to play to guitar, and they put some thoughts into the arrangements and whatnot but it just sounds so incredibly blah. I get that Mastodon were perhaps sick of doing long form concept albums, but there's gotta be better ways to come down from that then stuff like this. You've really gotta wonder why no one in the band, or the band's friends, etc etc decided that the clean vocals don't work, that the end result is basically vaguely proggy/hard to play stoner rock that no one is ever gonna remember.. Maybe a brief, rather punky album was the way forward? Perhaps something in a far more traditional vein? Just 60 minutes of prog noodles, hire a keyboardist etc? A short, 30 minute blast of the mathiest, wankiest stuff they could play? Cmon dudes, it's not that hard to come up with something better.\n\nI don't really have much of a concluding paragraph beyond \"this is fairly below average and you're better off avoiding it\".\n",
        "\nIt's a welcome return to see the band get back to making a cohesive and sprawling theme album. If their first 4 albums are fire, water, earth, and air/ether, then Emperor of Sand would be... Time? The writing process had to do with band member's family members getting cancer and dealing with the process. The loose story of the album is a wanderer is stranded in a desert and meets The Emperor of Sand who tells the wanderer that he will die after a short time. I feel it's time, rather than death because time is featured on Precious Stones, Roots Remain, Andromeda, a bit on Scorpionbreath, not only the word itself, but the theme of time.\n\nThe instrumentation is both simpler and more complex than previous albums. Brann Dailor's drumming (Which is normally filled to the brim with fills) is toned down a little bit to make way for increased vocal responsibility. It is mind boggling trying to air drum the beats AND sing the song. Kudos. On that note, It seems to almost the vocals are split down the middle between Troy and Brann. Both of them have gotten so much better over time. Keep it up! Brent comes in less often with his soulful and gritty melodies. The crazy fast lead hammer-on/pull-off noodly parts on lead guitar (Oh you know what I mean) are more complex than ever before, but they lost some of the charm in it. Before there was a tune and structure to them, now the novelty is just technical for the sake of technicality. This seems the right place to put this next part: There is too much tambourine (and triangle, where applicable). The first time I listened to it, the tambourine scraped my eardrum like a rusty nail. Okay, put it on \"Show Yourself\". It belongs on that track. In every other instance, it was an annoyance. By the 3rd listen I was able to tune it out, thank goodness...\n\nThe writing is nice in that, unlike the last two albums, there is a definite theme throughout the album. They have a lot of symbolism and hidden meaning in their songs, but I feel like on EoS, they hit a new level of symbolism. Maybe I'm just more familiar with what they're trying to say on it and I'm paying attention. When I bought Blood Mountain on day one, all I new about it was that I loved their previous 3 albums. Same goes for all the releases after until this one. I read a lot of interviews with the band members, for better or worse.\n\nI will say as a warning that there are some songs will turn many away. I'm looking at you, \"Show Yourself\". That one eventually grew on me, as long as I don't think about it being Mastodon. So if you've started to think this is a complete return to form, you'll be mistaken. They have gotten their old style back, but a lot of the songs are still trying to be accessible to all. The catchy lyrics are everywhere, with the sacrficie of heaviness or technicality. Still, it's undeniably the one and only Mastodon.\n\nBest Tracks:\n--Precious Stones\n--Roots Remain\n--Steambreather\n--Jaguar God\n\nTechnical Skill: 72% Album Structure: 88% Sound Quality: 80% Originality: 90% Writing: 86%\n",
        "\nOut of all popular contemporary metal bands, Mastodon is the only one I can get behind. I respect how little they care about genre boundaries or belonging to a certain scene. From day one, they have chosen their own path and there is always a possibility that a new album is not going to sound anything like its predecessor. Curveballs like their 2009 psychedelic metal masterpiece \u2018Crack The Skye\u2019 are probably a thing of the past, as every record that followed attempted to combine the best aspects of their discography thus far, but none of them quite succeeds as well as \u2018Emperor Of Sand\u2019 does.\n\n\u2018Emperor Of Sand\u2019 is the record on which Mastodon learned to do all the things they already did a lot better. Their riffs are still heavy and not too fast, there is an abundance of classy twin guitar harmonies, drummer Brann Dailor still lays down some downright incredible fills and yet, it all sounds just a little better than before. The highly melodic hooks that started appearing around the turn of the decade are integrated into the heavy songs a lot better than ever and the increasing classic rock influences mix with the band\u2019s heavy metal and hardcore roots more satisfyingly.\n\nMore importantly, the compositions are extremely interesting. Mastodon has clearly made an effort to make every section of the song be a new climax, which is especially beneficial to songs with a lot of drama, such as \u2018Roots Remain\u2019 and the epic closer \u2018Jaguar God\u2019. As stated before, the melodic choruses are still here, some songs even have several hooks, but they feel less like an attempt to cross over to the pop rock audience. Bill Kelliher and Brent Hinds have always been experts at weaving distinct guitar lines through each other and that feature of the band gets all the place it needs on \u2018Emperor Of Sand\u2019. Their bombastic sound helps. Hinds\u2019 synth guitar in \u2018Clandestiny\u2019 adds an extra dimension to the sound.\n\nIn addition, the triple lead vocal assault seems to work better than ever. Dailor is there for the cleans, Hinds switches between a raw snarl and an Ozzy-like voice and bassist Troy Sanders is easily the rawest and most powerful of the three. They feed off each other and complement each other, which adds dynamics to songs like the highly catchy \u2018Show Yourself\u2019, dramatic harmonies to \u2018Andromeda\u2019 and impressive trade-offs are scattered all over the album. The vocals are not the thing that makes the album though; the guitars and the insane drumming are. As always.\n\nWhile I will always be partial to \u2018Crack The Skye\u2019, Mastodon has really outdone itself on \u2018Emperor Of Sand\u2019. They have finally succeeded in combining all of their best qualities in a way that sounds \u201cfluent\u201d, for lack of a better term. I am somewhat reluctant to call the music on this record progressive metal, as the term conjures up images of Dream Theater clones, but it is a fact that this is the work of a metal band that wants to keep moving forward, with their virtuosity helping them rather than getting in the way of the songs. Quite an impressive feat, which makes \u2018Emperor Of Sand\u2019 one of the best metal albums released this year.\n\nRecommended tracks: \u2018Ancient Kingdom\u2019, \u2018Jaguar God\u2019, \u2018Steambreather\u2019, \u2018Roots Remain\u2019\n\nOriginally written for my Kevy Metal weblog.\n",
        "\nThis album is a travesty. It is well known at this point that Mastodon took their music in a completely different direction on this album; I have no problem with artists changing style, provided they pull it off properly. Nonetheless, albums like this are always risky - while I appreciate that some bands feel that they can't take a sound any further, or their preferences can change, jumping into a completely new style after spending several years forging a niche in a completely different one rarely works out, as history will demonstrate. Even with this in mind though, it's surprising that this album manages to be as bad as it is; as it has almost no redeeming qualities. What makes this even more disappointing is that this album follows Blood Mountain, which was honestly Mastodon's entry into the pantheon of metal's all-time greats.\n\nOn this album the band ditch their ballsy, riff-driven and energetic style of progressive/sludge metal in favour of a psychedelic, atmospheric and noodling approach to progressive rock/metal. There's nothing inherently wrong with changing styles or this particular sound, but as you may have gathered that doesn't happen here. The most crippling flaw to the music is a severe lack of focus and a drop in songwriting quality - songs never really reach a satisfying conclusion and dwell on ideas for too long with little development. The music lacks energy and can be very sluggish and plodding, with songs noodling too much and ending right where they began, as well as being too long for how little they manage to do. Songs take a long time to really get going at all, and they feel flat even when they do finally pick up any sort of steam. As a result this album is quite a chore to actively listen to, because it never presents enough ideas to keep you interested and even more damning is that it doesn't allow the mind to wander in its atmosphere because the instrumentation and song structures are too limited to allow for an atmosphere. It's too active to fade into the background but too boring to be focused on; unlike the prog-infused jams of past albums which had a lot more going for them in terms of activity, progression, dynamics and performances.\n\nNot only is the music structured and paced in a flat and uninteresting manner, but the performances themselves manage to be completely dull at best and flat out irritating at worst. A common theme with the instrumentation is that it's boring, with nothing captivating happening outside of the occasional aggressive riff. The music doesn't really allow for the spastic drumming of old albums but here Brann goes too far the other way - there's almost nothing to spice up his bare bones, unremarkable performance on this album. None of the riffs strike me as being particularly well written or interesting; certainly none stick in your memory and are nowhere near as aggressive as before, instead they're utterly anaemic and flat. They occasionally play around with more psychedelic and hypnotic styles of riff which would be interesting if like the rest of the guitar work they weren't run into the ground. \n\nThe most actively annoying element however is the vocal performance; the harsh vocals of their older material are completely gone and instead clean vocals are used throughout. In the past, Mastodon's clean vocals were basically never used entirely throughout a song and the music was so active that they never became a particularly large part of the music as they weren't exposed. They also wrote good vocal melodies to make the verses and hooks stick after just a few listens. However on this album, the band don't manage a single good or memorable vocal melody outside of 'Quintessence's hook, which is a problem when the vocals take centre stage and are far more integral to the music at large. With the vocals being this upfront, it also shows just how bad the singing really is - the vocals sound really mushy, weak, whiny, nasally and blown out, almost like a bad impersonation of any number of modern hard rock/post-grunge/alt metal vocalists; Chad Gray comes to mind. As there's no change-up in vocal style to speak of this becomes a big problem as the album wears on.\n\nThis is an awful album. It's bad on its own terms and a colossal disappointment given what preceded it. The music feels very superficial too - at no point does it ever really develop or do anything of note. You might get some psychedelic noodling here and there but it comes across as though the band is just pandering to a more highbrow audience, and as a result the music reeks of fakery. It feels like the band is trying too hard to be something they're not, and at the same time aren't trying hard enough with the music itself. Compared to the hugely fun and energetic albums of old this comes across as tired and dull, and the band sound like they're phoning it in. I'll never know what they were really thinking, but given all the talk of wanting to make their music more fun with subsequent albums even they find this boring, and it shows. It's shallow, annoying, unmemorable and dull, and I hate it.\n",
        "\n\u201cThe worst part about Emperor of Sand,\u201d my friend said to me, \u201cis that its weakest song is a total earworm.\u201d The album is good, others have said, but we\u2019ve heard it all before, haven\u2019t we? [1]. How can the apologist for Mastodon\u2019s post-Crack the Skye discography respond to these detractors?\n\nMastodon\u2019s latest opus is a concept album in the vein of its first four LPs. It is one centred around themes of loss inspired by the band members\u2019 personal encounters with death and life-threatening illness\u2014with cancer, more specifically. Like Mastodon\u2019s now classic (albeit controversial) Crack the Skye, however, the connection between the fantastical narrative of the lyrics and the personal turmoil underlying them is somewhat veiled. \u201cI didn't want to be literal about it,\u201d drummer and vocalist Brann Dailer\u2014the group\u2019s main lyricist\u2014explains, \u201cbut it's all in there. You can read between the lines\u201d [2]. \n\nRegardless of one\u2019s commitment to understanding and deciphering the album\u2019s concept, the lyrical content comes across as some of Mastodon\u2019s most imaginative and poignant yet. Consider Brann\u2019s vocal entrance to the album; his powerful and pure voice belting out the lines\u2014\u201cOceans of sand and mist/ Give way and yield my wake\u201d\u2014or his bittersweet call four songs later\u2014\u201cAnd when you sit and picture me/ Remember sitting in the sun and dancing in the rain\u201d. \n\nFollowing his debut as the group's third lead vocalist three albums earlier, Brann\u2019s singing role in the band has expanded to the point that he and bassist Troy Sanders are heard sharing vocal duties nearly in half on Emperor. At the same time, guitarist Brent Hind\u2019s voice has come to be used sparingly but all the more impactfully. Undeniably, this is the trio of singers\u2019 finest performances so far.\n\nAs always with these metal giants, it goes without saying that the instrumental performances supporting these voice-oriented songs are phenomenal. Much of the riffwork, we are told, is composed by Bill Kelliher\u2014whose rhythm playing is beyond reproach on this album. Brent Hind\u2019s solos\u2014captured in massive guitar tones\u2014tear through your body, while Troy\u2019s basslines sit powerfully in the pocket. And Brann\u2019s distinctive fill-heavy style behind the kit shines through undiminished, though occasionally simplified to support his vocals. \n\nOne hears elements of Mastodon\u2019s earlier work throughout Emperor. Of course, the album continues to traverse the groovy but progressive metal / rock terrain of The Hunter and Once More \u2018Round the Sun. Die-hard sludge metal fans who exited the band\u2019s audience after Crack the Skye are not given much reason to return to the band now. Yet one also finds riffs reminiscent of Blood Mountain in the ultra-heavy \u201cRoots Remain\u201d and \u201cAndromeda\u201d. To some extent, one must concede to the detractors that Mastodon does not chart much new territory here. Sure, the driving drums during the guitar solo section of \u201cAncient Kingdom\u201d introduce a striking, lively jazz feel we\u2019ve not heard from them before, but on the whole Mastodon continue the slow evolution that has amounted over time to a 180 degree turn since their debut Remission.\n\nMost of the controversy surrounding that evolution is fueled by difference of taste. As such, all an apologist for Mastodon\u2019s post-Crack the Skye discography can do is appeal to the tastes of similar tongues out there. What they can expect to find is a album with a cinematic narrative and musical arc, and a strong sense of identity. The peaks of this journey through Emperor's desertscape are the crushing opener \"Saltan's Curse\", epic closer \"Jaguar God\", the bouncing, blusey \"Steambreather\", the eclectic \"Ancient Kingdom\" and, for the audience that's long renounced its metal elitism, the welcome earworm, \"Show Yourself\". \n\n1.\thttp://www.metalinjection.net/reviews/mastodon-emperor-of-sand\n2.\thttp://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/mastodon-detail-new-album-emperor-of-sand-w463210\n",
        "\nWith their latest album, Mastodon moves closer to the conceptual ambitions of Crack the Skye after a few years of taking a more laidback approach to music. For those of you who couldn\u2019t stay awake through Mastodon\u2019s polarizing fourth full-length, you may be happy to learn that the band is much more restrained here than they were on Skye. This time around, the band manages to curb its excesses, both in terms of long-winded song structures and complex playing, gifting us with a concept album fully dedicated to its own otherworldly vibes without ever seeming to go overboard with any of the tricks it employs.\n\nA concept album about a solitary man wandering in the desert that\u2019s supposed to be symbolic of struggles with cancer, Emperor of Sand does a commendable job of staying thematically consistent in terms of the sounds on display. Mastodon weaves a familiar tapestry out of dense guitar lines, mystical atmospherics, tasteful, expressive soloing and a melange of vocal approaches ranging from chant-like singing to roars that somehow sound both distant and forceful. Though a few of these songs are built on muscular riffs, like the punishing march that makes up about half of album opener \u2018Sultan\u2019s Curse\u2019, Mastodon is largely de-emphasizing the bombastic shows of force that were so prominent on albums like Leviathan, perhaps best exemplified by drummer Brann Dailor's calmer, more measured approach to bashing the skins. He hasn't quite abandoned his maximalist, fill-heavy style but that sort of all-out drum punishment only appears every now and then on Emperor. \n\n\u2018Show Yourself\u2019 is the most recognizable track here because it\u2019s the only one clearly written with radio airplay in mind, making it something of an outlier. It\u2019s a straight-forward, entertaining modern rocker that could have been written for The Hunter or Once More \u2019Round the Sun. It\u2019s more direct and simplistic than the other tracks here, devoid of that complex mystical-sounding ambience Mastodon loves so much, but still manages to fit in with the album\u2019s overall sonic landscape. \n\nThe rest of this offering is a homogeneous assortment of songs that melt into each other a bit. Emperor is clearly intended to be one journey rather than a collection of songs. From the swirls of mesmerizing leads in 'Precious Stones' to the calm but eerie verses in 'Steambreather' to the madcap but not at all out of place solo in 'Roots Remain', the album flows from one track to the next. Along the way, there are plenty of strong solos, emotive interludes, rousing choruses, and transitions so smooth you don't even realize the song is changing. Though there aren't really any dull moments (with the exception of parts of 'Roots Remain' and 'Ancient Kingdom', both of which drag a bit), Emperor isn't going to blow your mind. If the Mastodon of old's mixture of kinetic playing and bizarre atmosphere is exactly what you want out of this album, you won't be thoroughly wowed, though people who find their past excesses irritating might find this more conservative incarnation of the Atlanta quartet refreshing.\n\nIf you demand a simple summation of what this album is, you're in luck: Emperor of Sand is a skillful balancing act between the accessibility of The Hunter and the progressive tendencies of Crack the Skye. By blending what works in both albums, the product we're left with manages to avoid the issues they had but sadly doesn't quite reach the impressive heights both of those achieve in their brightest moments.\n",
        "\nI'm constantly surprised by Mastodon for two different reasons. The first is that it seems (certainly as far as comments on this website go) the band have been overcritiqued, overpraised, and underthought, which leaves a dangerous vacuum for fanatics and trolls to fill with aimless illogic. The other reason is a more simple one: Mastodon have been able to remain constantly surprising. The Georgians have never released two albums the same, nor really two songs the same, slugging through a few different styles while staying grounded in the sludge genre, which is baffling considering their popularity because sludge is like the fat, smelly kid in your class (unfair, I know, but see Crowbar for stereotypical reference). Thus, finding 19 reviews for Crack the Skye, all but two of which are either as high as 90% or under 40% - and agreeing with precisely none of them - time comes to roll up my sleeves and get down to business.\n\nThe first thing from most of those other reviews that I want to slap in the face is that this is in any way a progressive rock album. I know that some of the Mastodon guys went on record prior to the album's release saying that they had been influenced by prog rock for this release, while Brent Hinds went so far as to say that he didn't consider Mastodon a metal band, but \"art rock\" instead, yet if you actually listen to the performances here or the instrumental tones or the tone of the music it doesn't come very close to anything I know as progressive rock. Naturally, we can dispense with the \"rock\" epithet straight away, since there are a load of heavy moments alongside a mild increase in the proportion of softer material. However, compared to Blood Mountain, I don't really find that the general aesthetic has changed greatly, still packing in the power of Troy Sanders massively distorted bass (try 'Ghost of Karelia' for a dose of thunder), a similarly showy, though less intense, drum battery from Brann Dailor, and enough big fuck-off riffs to break the spines of every King Crimson and Pink Floyd member a hundred times over. Yes, there are clean vocals throughout the majority of the songs; sure, the guitars play without distortion for a stretch in most tracks; right, the aggression is dialled back in favour of introspection. However, this doesn't diverge so much from the previous trends as most thought at the time.\n\nWhat probably is true, on the other hand, is that this can lay claim to being more overtly expansive and perhaps psychedelic than Blood Mountain could. The assault of heaviness is less physical (a far cry from the early Mastodon on Remission and Leviathan) and comes drifting in rather than crashing down, which is more suitable for the theme of the album, which was the air element. As such, I would place songs like 'The Czar' and 'Quintessence' somewhere in the vicinity of the out-there psych/sludge/doom of underground outfits such as YOB, Ufomammut, and frequent collaborators Neurosis owing to the sprawl of sounds and reflective bent of the heaviness. For all these comparisons, there is still a strong argument that Mastodon don't have any direct relatives, which might just be more evident on Crack the Skye than anywhere else. There are only portions of 'The Last Baron', 'Oblivion', and the whole of 'Divinations' that hit hard and directly, while the rest of the material on offer creates atmosphere in a manner that the band hadn't done before and haven't really been able to since. The billowing effect of the guitars, the slower paces, and the indirect manner of playing on songs such as 'Quintessence' require deep concentration in the same manner as the band's earlier releases, although the mood is often more relaxed and purely explorative than those aforementioned albums. To contrast, when the heaviness hits, the power is all the more obvious, giving the 50 minute experience a decent balance.\n\nThe second thing that needs to be more closely inspected is the alternate claims that this is either a godly album or one that sucks balls so hard it represents a choking hazard. One can come at this from many different angles, so I will try to be careful not to tread on any toes. In the first place, there is certainly little to contest in terms of the bandmembers' musical skills: instrumentally, they are all practically at the top of their respective games, playing in several styles and shapeshifting throughout the more complex songs with admirable ease, which places the jazz-metal freakout in the closing minutes of 'The Last Baron' high among the highlights. Vocally, I have more reason to be doubtful, since I understand that the three singers' contributions (in uneven quantities, all but Bill Kelliher get a lead performance) can be empirically nasal (Brann Dailor especially), drawling (seems to be Brent Hinds in this case), or just a bit underwhelming (Troy Sanders the culprit). I don't really mind the vocals, though it would have allowed songs like 'Oblivion' to better meet the ambition with which they were written and to elevate the emotion a step further.\n\nRegarding the songwriting aspect, the two lengthy numbers seem to divide listeners into the same old \"Opeth rules\" and \"Opeth sucks\" categories due to their drawn-out nature and sometimes patchwork structuring. While I think any reference to Opeth is unhelpful in imagining the progress of 'The Czar' and 'The Last Baron', largely because Mastodon here manage to give these epics a much stronger sense of direction than the Swedes, I do remember feeling bored the first time I listened through the whole album, so there may be issues for those with short concentration spans. The opposing view is that those long songs are definitive proof that Mastodon were able to grasp complete control of progression and build emotional and structural climaxes at the end of those numbers, meaning that the pay-off is exponentially greater than the final chorus of a four-minute effort. Personally, I feel that both 'The Czar' and 'The Last Baron' succeed more than they suck, yet there is still room to tweak a few parts here and there, particularly when the former loses steam at around the seven minute mark and refracts into a kind of depressed haze of repeated vocal lines and soloing that definitely remind me of Pink Floyd on this occasion. The 13 minute closer has the advantage of finishing on a high note, but 'The Last Baron' takes longer to get there, as does the title track, something that the band's shorter compositions have rarely struggled with.\n\nPutting these comments together into a cohesive whole feels rather like the task that faced Mastodon as they attempted to assimilate the progressive elements into their sludgy base and, as a result, makes me realize that my review feels slightly cobbled together, as does Crack the Skye. I think that the range of moods and styles on offer here are testament to the ambition that went into the creation of the album and one of its finest features, though it is also true that the same feature robs the whole thing of the kind of concentration that would have produced a higher overall quality. For example, 'Divinations' is a great romp through riffs and metalhead bliss, but it sits uneasily beside the amorphous 'Quintessence', resulting in occasional abruptness as we are thrown about from one part to another. What Mastodon certainly achieve is a prevailing interest: something that has led to the many different views about the music and a great many listens on my part.\n",
        "\nMastodon are one of today's most popular metal bands so it's no surprise that they seem to be one of the more divisive bands on this forum. Simultaneously lauded by the faithful and chastised by the elite for their constantly shifting approach to the genre, I can understand why people enjoy and dislike Mastodon in equal measure. Since 2004's 'Leviathan' Mastodon have been on a 10+ year identity crisis, struggling to come to terms with their identity as the leaders of a burgeoning sludge metal scene whilst wanting to explore their other tastes in progressive rock as well as simpler, radio friendly fare. \n\nAfter taking a step away from the riff-tastic 'Leviathan' and insane 'Blood Mountain', Mastodon reached a critical peak with 2009's vastly more progressive 'Crack The Skye'. Then Mastodon surprised their fans yet again with the 2011 follow up album 'The Hunter', which was as different from 'Crack The Skye' as that was from 'Leviathan'. This release further expanded their resume to include radio friendly, but still heavy and satisfying, heavy metal. In Brann Dailor's own words, Mastodon wanted to write an album that would be played at beer swilling parties. They achieved this end wonderfully and while that release covered a lot of old ground as well, it left a great deal of the old school Mastodon fans feeling a little cold. Its true, 'The Hunter' and 2014's similar 'Once More Around the Sun' were far cries from the brutality of 'Leviathan' and 'Remission'.\n\nNow, fast forward to the present and Mastodon occupy an unusual position in the metal world. Like Opeth, they have managed to alienate many of their earlier fans while winning the favour of newer, less extreme fans. Taking too far a step backwards at this point could run the risk of both alienating their new fans and give rise to claims of being 'disingenuous' or 'fake' by older fans. Taking another step off the plank into a sea of progressive and psychedelic self indulgence would most likely permanently divorce them from their old fans while also potentially disillusioning their new fans who were just there for the beer, riffs and choruses. \n\nWhat then to do? The answer is' Emperor of Sand'. This album is a concise capture of everything this band has set out to explore since 'Leviathan'. Watching the 'Making Of...' videos on Youtube, it's clear that the overwhelming modus operandi of this album was to bring back some of the heaviness that many felt were lacking on the previous three releases, whilst still keeping a foot firmly in their recent experiments. The three singles released, 'Sultan's Curse', 'Show Yourself' and 'Andromeda' are in fact a great capture of the ground that this album covers. 'Show Yourself' is a clear reference to 'Hunter's' poppier fare, 'Sultan's Curse' a reference to the slower epic moments of 'Skye' and 'Blood Mountain and the interesting 'Andromeda' is a chaotic maelstrom of old school Mastodon riffs, frenetic guitar harmonies and transcendent choral arrangements. \n\nOn first listen this album sometimes threatens to become a little vacuous. You hear the hooks, you hear the riffs and the solos and think \"Yeah, this is Mastodon but I'm not feeling much\". Anyone that's familiar with gut-punching songs like 'Blood & Thunder' or sorrowful epics like 'The Hunter' or 'The Czar', will admit that Mastodon have a great but often under utilized ability to really make you feel something. It's only after the 4th or so playthrough that the sheer amount of focus and love that has been poured into this record becomes apparent. There are very few moments of excess, everything seems to be in its right place and in its right quantity. In 'Andromeda' the huge riff, which we haven't heard anything like from Mastodon since Blood Mountain, quickly gives way to frantic noodling and a spacey guitar solo. Nothing seems to linger to the point of boredom. \n\nJust when you've had a poppier song thrown your way, 'Emperor' throws you a more progressive curveball followed by a thunderous riff monster, as is the case with the middle three tracks of 'Steambreather', 'Roots Remain' and 'Words to the Wise'. Highlighting their hooky, proggy and heavy nature, the album seems to have achieved perfect balance with the provision of these three key Mastodon elements. Every listen leaves me more and more impressed with just how well honed they have made this album. \n\nPerformance wise there is little in the way of criticism. Sure, Mastodon's three vocal attack is a bit love it or hate it (especially with regards to Mr. Hinds vocal delivery) but it's a part of Mastodon that I love. Brann has really come into his own as a singer since 'Skye' and he reaches a new career high point on 'Steambreather' where he really is channeling an early 1980's Ozzy in exactly the right way. His drum performance is a little more restrained than we've heard for a while but I do find this fits the album well and there are plenty of moments where he really throws some great fills in the mix. The heavier moments of 'Scorpion Breath' see some of his fastest work since 'Leviathan' too! By all accounts, Bill is the riff man of Mastodon and this album really sees some of his best work in a a long time, notably in the heavier parts of 'Jaguar God' and the already mentioned 'Andromeda'. My stand out performance has to go to Brent Hinds as ever, who I genuinely feel is the most impressive guitar soloist of our age. His solo at the end of 'Jaguar God' in particular had me out in chills and is now my major album highlight. \n\nDespite the above, it's not all good. I do feel that this album lacks some of the innovation that permeated their earlier work and the fact that it took me several listens to really 'get it' suggests a barrier that some fans may find insurmountable. A criticism could be made that by trying to provide a capture of everything that made them unique, they have instead lost a little of their spirit. However, these doubts seem to be decreasing more and more with every play through. Compared specifically to the last two records, 'Emperor of Sand' seems heavier, better edited, more focused and overall the product of a band which is finally at ease with themselves!\n\nAnother reviewer on another site noted that this album feels very much like the summation and perhaps end of an era for Mastodon. For a band that has spent the last decade on an extended identity exercise, I don't think there has ever really been a band that has made such an act so enjoyable for so many people. There are so many examples of bands changing style and being torn apart by fans and critics but Mastodon seems to have somehow maintained their credibility while having a great deal of fun in figuring out who the hell they actually are. What the future holds for them I have no idea at this stage, however I do very much agree that this album see's a summation of the last decade of Mastodon's career and what a wonderful decade it has been!\n",
        "\nThe heat is off Mastodon these days (only 4 reviews for 2014's Once More Round the Sun compared to 17 for The Hunter), but it doesn't stop their 00s output being highly influential on the new wave of metal that has appeared since. Their sound never quite had a specific focal point, though originating from sludge metal, and expands to include a terrifying array of different influences and aspects on an album such as this, Blood Mountain. Perhaps a testament to the band's creativity, the mountain has never been mined fully, leaving many ideas here that remain unique and instantly recognizable.\n\nFirstly, it's key to point out that Mastodon were never as accessible as their mainstream reputation suggested, particularly evident when listening to a song such as 'Sleeping Giant', which uses its latter half to twist and turn mazily on fleeting guitar melodies, extended drum fills, and frequently switching musical ideas. Nothing ever stays still for any great length of time, though the band never descend into total self-indulgence or allow their jamming to carry too far, finishing most of the songs in under 5 minutes. If you're eyeing that 22:15 runtime of the closing 'Pendulous Skin', then fear not, because most of that is silence spent waiting for Kyuss/QOTSA guitarist Josh Homme to read a tongue in cheek fan letter to the band. However, packed into those tight songs, expect a lot of dazzling guitar runs, deliberately tricky polyrhythms, and many-legged riffs that crawl off sideways the moment you blink. For technical skill and attention to detail, Blood Mountain is still gobsmacking 10 years after the event.\n\nWhat seems a bit strange about the album is that it tries so hard to be head-scratching. There are all sorts of weird and random things left scattered across the musical space, not least the gobbledigook tape-rewinding words in 'Bladecatcher' that appear over hyper-speed death thrash, which breaks for a wonderfully light and fun melody/riff/guitar thing and then thundering chords. Forget about a bloody mountain, you feel like Mastodon are taking you on a tour through the Amazon rainforest, displaying the world's largest natural selection of sludge, thrash, extreme, prog, shred, and mainstream metal. Arguably the most straightforward song is 'Colony of Birchmen', which has one of the catchiest mid-paced riffs you're likely to hear and a kind of Metallica strut to its progress, despite still feeling otherworldly and atmospheric. The songs mostly function as discrete pieces of music, though the themes overlap to some extent (lots of creatures and far-flung places), leaving us slightly confused by the whirlwind progression of ideas and the many changes in direction.\n\nIn her review, NausikaDalazBlindaz mentions that Mastodon don't always achieve the \"sense of wonder, awe and majesty\" they are aiming for, which I must agree with to some extent. She highlights the sometimes lacklustre vocals, provided here mostly by Troy Sanders (as opposed to Brent Hinds who would sing more on Mastodon's later albums), as one of the factors in that failure and that also holds true, since there are several moments when his delivery - and Hinds's on 'This Mortal Soil' as well - fails to meet the atmospheric requirements of the music, resulting in a loss of sense of place and spectacle as much as a sense of wonder. Nevertheless, this weakness also highlights the album's key strength, which is that the majority of the music can transport the listener away to another place and opens itself up completely to the imagination. The only other complaint that seems pertinent is that there isn't a great deal in the way of hooks, partly caused by the vocal performance, though there are more complex features to hold onto once you get under the surface of the songs.\n\nLooking back at my relationship with this album, I must say that I neglected its quality for a long time, but when I really listen deeply to it I can find a great deal both to enjoy and admire, as well as knowing that it has a fairly unique position in metal. None of the 12 songs are poor, though 'Hand of Stone' and 'This Mortal Soil' seem to be lacking something. If searching for pure enjoyment and great songwriting, 'The Wolf Is Loose', 'Colony of Birchmen', and 'Crystal Skull' should do the job for you; fans of instrumental madness and progressive wanderings will drool at the feet of 'Capillarian Crest', 'Siberian Divide', and 'Sleeping Giant'. That said, it's difficult to see why you wouldn't enjoy Blood Mountain and you will probably be blown away by some of it too.\n",
        "\nMastodon probably needs no introduction to readers of this site. Leviathan was one of the defining metal releases of the 2000s, and Crack the Skye proved they could play progressive rock as well as many of the genre's '70s stalwarts. Their blend of progressive metal and sludge earned them a justifiable reputation as one of the most formidable forces in the genre.\n\nThis release, however, is not very widely known. Some of the songs here were later re-recorded for their early EP releases Lifesblood and Slick Leg, the former of which is somewhat better known. All of them were later re-released on the compilation Call of the Mastodon, which is also better known than this demo, but with re-recorded vocals by Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds. (This compilation also changed the ordering of the tracks I've been used to since I discovered the band in 2004, which can't be solved by simply reordering my playlist since several of the songs segue seamlessly into one another). The versions on this demo are unique in Mastodon's catalogue for featuring the work of original vocalist Eric Saner.\n\nWhile I don't think Saner would have been a good fit for the band's later material, his vocals here are a good match for the band's unearthly roar. While the band demonstrates some of the progressive sensibilities that would later stretch some of their songs past the ten-minute mark, none of the songs here reaches much past four and a half minutes. The band is most interested in pummeling you with an endless succession of killer sludge riffs. These riffs often result in unusual song structures (nearly every song changes meter signature at least once, and most of them contain compound meters like 5/4 or 7/4), but compared to their later material (particularly from after they signed to a major label), it's heavy. Saner's unrelenting roar strikes me as a good fit here, though which versions a listener prefers will likely be down to personal taste.\n\nThe band's later material is definitely more sophisticated, and a listener expecting an experience like that of Crack the Skye will be in for a huge shock. However, this is definitely recommended for fans of more adventurous sludge.\n",
        "\n(Review originally appeared in Gnosis Webzine in 2002)\n\n\nRemission has to be one of my most anticipated discs to come out this year. After falling in love with Mastodon\u2019s debut EP (Lifesblood), I knew that this was a band destined for great things. \n\nTo be fair, this album is a tad bit overrated. However, this is not the band\u2019s fault. This is the fault of the PR hype machine that touts every new album that is a little bit different than the norm as the greatest thing to happen to metal since the discovery of distortion. Nothing ever lives up to its hype, but Remission stacks up very well, and it\u2019s an important album to the forward progression of this music form. I\u2019d recommend this album for the instrumentals alone.\n\nRemission is an excellent album, melding brash, abrupt, noisecore riffing with 70's metal guitar heroics and southern rock soul. Last year\u2019s Lifesblood EP was a schizophrenic mishmash of different facets of extreme music, which seemed motivated by the need to have everyone shut up and take notice. Remission is more of a focused affair, mature and confident, and really focused around some strong songwriting.\n\nMastodon\u2019s not-so-secret weapon is their evil genius of a drummer, Brann Dailor. He's Neil Peart on Chemical X. What makes Brann better than most drummers out there playing extreme music is that while he has massive ability and skill, but unlike a lot of metal drummers, he chooses to play for the song. He has more in common with Bill Bruford, Neil Peart, and Carl Palmer, than he has with modern extreme metal drummers such as Tony Loreano or Nick Barker.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that the other guys in the band are total slobs or anything. They are all very proficient on their respective instruments. The guitar team of Bill Kelliher & Brent Hines have a pretty unique thing going on. For the most part, the heavier riffs are hardcore based, although far more technical than what that implies. What makes these guys special though, is that they have a pretty eclectic arsenal of musical styles to draw from, such as their magnificent melodic parts, which brings to mind the soaring dual harmonies of Iron Maiden and Thin Lizzy. However, these guys are just as likely to flourish the songs on Remission with quirky chicken pickin\u2019 or shimmering jazz runs, as they are to bust out with alternate-picked thrash insanity.\n\nUnfortunately, I have a few minor gripes. The bass is mixed too low, and while you can tell that it is filling out the bottom end sonically, I feel like it\u2019s presence should have been a bit more audible. Also, the vocals aren\u2019t anything special \u2013just your basic hardcore/death vocals. They don\u2019t detract from the music really. They just don\u2019t add a whole lot. I can overlook this pretty easily, because vocal duties are split between the stringsmen, and they handle their (more important) instrumental duties valiantly.\n",
        "\nWhile you should never judge a book by it's cover, I think it's safe to say that nine out of ten time you can do so with an album cover, since the cover art of a band's album can tell you a lot about the experience you will undergo by listening to it, especially if it's a metal album. In the case of Atlanta based prog/sludge metal outfit Mastodon, you have a band who have a knack for putting some eye catching cover art on their albums, even if the content inside is spotty at best. \"Once More 'Round the Sun\" caught my eye with a psychedelic cover that looks as if it was conceived by someone listening to 60s and 70s stoner rock while tripping on Peyote. Why bring this up? Because this here is a fine example of cover art revealing what is in store for the listener. \"Once More 'Round the Sun\" takes the simpler, more straightforward approach of Mastodon's previous album \"The Hunter\" and mixes it with their progressive influences, coming up with a sound that resembles the Melvins mixed with Rush or some other progressive rock act.\n\nThe strong point on this album are the individual songs and the talents of the musicians pumping the songs out. Mastodon has always been a group of talented musicians, but as songwriters they have always been spotty, largely because their early work consisted of attempts at marrying groove, sludge and progressive metal in ways that made their songs sound horribly chaotic, with the drums sounding like they were playing a completely different song from the what the guitarist was playing, which would be different from the vocals etc. Mastodon have by now mostly figured out how to write songs where all the musicians flow together, and this album is a testament to that. Songs such as \"High Road\", the title track, \"Feast Your Eyes\" and \"Asleep in the Deep\" all follow a straightforward Sabbath inspired approach to the riffs and rhythms, but with lighter, more melodic musical qualities reminiscent of Alex Lifeson's work in Rush adding a sense of variety that keeps this from being mere Sabbath worship with a wild drummer. The guitar solos are all fairly well written, and never sacrifice emotion in exchange for fancy fretwork. The song \"Aunt Lisa\" even goes so far as to have rather spacey, \"Dark Side of the Moon\" style sound effects added into the midst of the song to give the song an even greater connection to Mastodon's progressive influences, as if the otherworldly vocal approach (more on that in a bit) and opening riff that calls to mind a creepier version of Rush's \"Free Will\" wasn't already doing that. Interestingly enough, one of the best songs on the album is the one that sounds as if it was tailor-made to be a single, and that is \"The Motherload\". This song works very well thanks to a combination of a riff with the right amount of groove, an effective vocal performance and melody, and intricate drum work that doesn't distract from the song the way it has with other Mastodon songs. Brent Hinds pours the right balance of feeling and technical prowess into the guitar solo and the lead guitar has a classic metal-sounding tone that fits perfectly with the quasi-psychedelic approach the band is going with.\n\nThat said, this album is certainly not perfect, and part of that has to do with the vocals. If you are unfamiliar with Mastodon, there are two main vocalists, guitarist Brett Hinds and drummer Brann Dailor. Surprisingly, it is the drummer that is the stronger vocalist, largely because he handles melody better than Hinds, who at times sounds dangerously close to Glenn Danzig trying to sing hardcore. Dailor sings melody far better, and gives \"The Motherload\" and \"Ember City\" a quality beyond what Hinds could provide. Nonetheless, my complaint is not with the vocal performance (though the more Dailor takes up vocal duties, the better in my opinion) but with how vocals are mixed in. Basically, the vocals can go from anywhere from being placed prominently in the front of the mix (where they are very often given and ethereal atmosphere reminiscent of Pink Floyd) to place in the far back of the mix. This may seem like a minor complaint, but when the vocals in \"Feast Your Eyes\" would be practically incomprehensible without a lyric sheet, then there's a problem. I'm sure with repeat listening, one's ears would become desensitized to this flaw in production, but it is incredibly noticeable difference when halfway through the album the vocalist suddenly becomes audible. \n\nAs with their albums before, Mastodon concocts an intriguing fusion of sludge and progressive metal, but the difference here is that they have managed to add in the more eclectic influences without sacrificing the quality of the songs as a whole. It's been an upward journey for them, and I'm sure there will be those who prefer their earlier work, but \"Once More 'Round the Sun\" has struck a stronger nerve with me than most of what I've heard from Mastodon before, due in part to their excellent songwriting and clever use of psychedelic influences that never feel too overbearing. Even if you never found yourself enjoying Mastodon's previous work, \"Once More \"Round the Sun\" has enough to offer non-fans who enjoy sludge, prog, or even just good songwriting. I must admit, I was never a big Mastodon fan beyond a few songs, and I found myself enjoying most of this album. It didn't exactly make me a total believer, but should they keep up on this track, their next album might.\n",
        "\n2011 saw Mastodon embark into radio friendly territory with 'The Hunter', sporting shorter, more concise songwriting, and a well rounded approach to balance between aggression and melody. This was a logical step to take after the majestic progressive metal mammoth that is 'Crack the Skye', so the question in all of our heads was: \"Was 'The Hunter' just a reaction to 'Crack the Skye', or will they go further on this path now?\" The answer appears to be yes, and like 'The Hunter' it's not an entirely bad thing. So the new Mastodon is much more melody driven, much more radio friendly, much less aggressive. Fans of their last album rejoice, those wishing for more 'Crack the Skye' and 'Leviathan' adapt or cry. \n\nThe first four songs are similar, using this new psychedelic rock/metal fusion sound so identifiably \"Mastodon\" now. Laden with grooves and revolving voices in the band, drummer Brann Dailor shines particularly in \"The Motherload\", and \"High Road\" sees a nice sludgy sound once more. From here on out the album becomes inconsistent and fairly dull, the songs all sound like rehashes of the same Mastodon ideas we've all heard before, only not as good. Tracks 5, 6, and 7 in particular feel thoroughly done and tired. \n\nMastodon now is fusing rock cliches and unoriginal melodies with the typical frantic drum work and riffage we associate with Mastodon. There are sometimes brief glitters of badassery, as in both the opening riffs of \"Aunt Lisa\" and it's outdo (\"Hey ho let's fucking go, hey ho let's get up and rock and roll!), and the outro jamming on \"Halloween\", but all in all these great moments are far and few between on the latter half of the album, making for a very trying and uneven listening experience. Also worth a mention is the obvious King Diamond worship song \"Diamond in the Witch House\", featuring a moaning Troy Sanders mimicking the King himself, the song is boring, however, like much of the album. \n\nAll in all we're treated to a shadow of 'The Hunter', an uneven listening experience seeing the first half of the album explore some really great ideas, but the second half of the album is filled with seemingly half-baked ideas which just don't entertain. This album is really the first Mastodon album I genuinely don't like, and it pains me to say that, as Mastodon is easily one of the rising stars in the metal/rock world. \n\nHighlight tracks: \"The Motherload\", \"Tread Lightly\", \"High Road\"\n",
        "\nThe Georgian boys are back with their sixth album already and every single of their releases was a surprise for the listeners and it's no exception this time either. Their evolution towards more progressive realms felt natural and so is their endeavour into more melodic territories.\n\nIn 2011, we were offered a very poppy album with the sadly underwhelming The Hunter, an album plagued with too many songs and fillers but with some jewels like the title track or \u201cStargasm\u201d. I'm sure I wasn't the only person expecting their new one with haste and interest. I've been following the band intensely since the excellent Blood Mountain, an opus created just when I was starting to get into metal and even if my horizons changed after my formative years, Mastodon remains an important band for me and they'll be seen as the most important American metal band of their generation. I remember when I discovered them, I was sixteen and it was the week that I also got Frances the Mute by The Mars Volta, a band that also became one of my favourite. I opened BM's booklet and I thought it was very odd that Cedric Bixler-Zavala (singer of TMV) was featured as a guest. What a fun coincidence, everything happens for a reason! And now, it's time for the first Mastodon full length since the tragic dissolution (some will say hallelujah but to hell with them) of the El Paso prog juggernauts and it's easily a contender for my album of 2014.\n\nAfter only one listening, I already told myself that the main problem of their previous record was solved. OM'RTS has absolutely no filler whatsoever. Its main strength is its cohesion and unity. The eleven songs for fifty four minutes is perhaps their most balanced album to date. One of the forces of an album like Leviathan was its diversity but it didn't worked as well on Crack the Skye, an album with a great vision ultimately afflicted with an overachieving will. I mean, I liked the long tracks like \u201cThe Last Baron\u201d but the album wasn't as close-knitted as this one even though I think it was honourable progressive metal. CTS also had too many members of the band trying their hand at the mic and it felt disjointed at times. While their new opus is definitely their strongest vocally speaking or at least their most accessible. I'm sure the people who were complaining about how the vocals were their weakest quality won't find much material to complain about here. Sanders (who's obviously Mastodon's best singer) and Hinds are prevalent but they seem harder to differentiate this time around or maybe it was so well constructed that it isn't apparent.Their deliveries are mostly clean but rough and they're simply better at the game, they know their forces and explore them. The choruses are powerful and the use of ethereal, atmospheric but grasping vocals enhance the whole experience\n\nLyrically speaking, it's not as special as CTS or weird like The Hunter, it doesn't seem conceptual this time around (perhaps for the better since they'll be repeating themselves and that's counterproductive.) The lyrics are still deeply personal and metaphorical and they flow very well. It's kind of giving me a contemplative vibe that goes hand in hand with the rock influences they're incorporating this time around, you can easily hear the love they have for Deftones and Alice in Chains and I have no problem with that!\n\nIt goes without saying but don't expect Mastodon to go back to their sludgey roots on this album, it's perhaps heavier than The Hunter or maybe I think it is since it's not as joyful. It's sort of a return to a math-esque sound not so present on their two latest albums and it delivers immense heavy riffs as well (such as the great epic closer \u201cDiamond in the Witch House\u201d with \u201csurprise\u201d guest vocals from Neurosis' Scott Kelly.) Of course, a Mastodon album wouldn't be complete with other guests, this time the all girls punk band The Coat Hangers from their local city of Atlanta are featured on the fun \u201cAunt Lisa\u201d with girly, shouted vocals adding a juvenile feel to the track.\n\nHinds and Kelliher (massive guitarists for sure) are not quite as inclined to show off their lead guitar skills as they were before but they let loose some tasty leads like on the single \u201cHigh Road\u201d. Throughout the album, they prove once again that they're modern metal's most accomplish guitar duo. They have their own distinctive approach and alongside Dailor's inventive, intense and intelligent drumming, it's part of Mastodon's signature sound. It's full of blistering and smart riffs intertwined with groovy rhytmns played wonderfully showcasing that they're one of the proudest Rush disciples of the new millenium. Mastodon has always been a technical band but I truly believe that it never was a burden to their compositions, quite the opposite.\n\nIndeed, it's progressive & technical but without giving up one iota of melodic might. \u201cTread Lightly\u201d, the opening song, is the perfect example with its sweeping leads and its catchy vocal patterns. They learned of their gigantic progressive voyage with CTS but played a more subdued card on OM'RTS and still managed to craft an impressive and original record. Proof that sometimes less is more. Nevertheless, this album is fucking intricate and rich and it's just doesn't try to be too creative or pop, it just is. It's like they accepted the fact that they were going in a poppier direction, that's a direct continuation of The Hunter which can be seen as a transition album since the formula & the quality weren't quite there yet.\n\nIt really feels like Mastodon took the better songwriting of The Hunter and mixed the idiosyncratic power from their other albums with it. Someone might dislike Mastodon for a bunch of reasons (their immense popularity, their beards, the fact they moved on from extreme metal and so on...) but no one can say that they sound like another band. If a bunch of hipsters try to mimic them, they'll strike again with a new, fresh record and the kids will have to update their sound once again. They're reinventing themselves after each record and for most bands, this prowess would be disastrous but not with these fabulous and silly hairy homo sapiens sapiens.\n\nIt's without a doubt their best album since Blood Mountain and it helps building an important, almost faultless legacy for the band. I had low expectations after their previous album and this was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended for fans of adventurous, catchy prog metal with a flair for originality. Mastodon are still on the rise and there's no way to stoptheir progression. In time, you will join them in the sun, In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.\n\nMetantoine's Magickal Realm\n",
        "\nMastodon is one of the only bands in metal today where you don't know what kind of album they will make next. Each record they seem to top the last one, and craft something new and exciting. With a career spanning six albums, their musical output is broad and goes into different directions in terms of music and concepts. Mastodon's music \n\nOne thing that the band has always loved to do is to write long and complex epics a more prominent example is the band's 2009 opus, Crack the Skye. With their music, Mastodon have always pushed the envelope, but with this sixth studio outing, the band decided to take a step back and write shorter, more relaxed tunes while retaining the traditional Mastodon vibe. What's on the record is an impressive collection of tunes that manages to broaden the band's sound even further. In doing so, I feel that The Hunter is by far Mastodon's most accessible album. Here you have a good blend of straight forward rockers like \"Dry Bone Valley\" and \"Curl of the Burl\" to more complex tunes like \"Creature Lives\" and \u201cThe Sparrow\". While cutting down on long epics, Mastodon where album to make something refreshing while keeping the core of their sound intact. There are several standout tracks most notably \u201cOctopus Has No Friends\" and \"All the Heavy Lifting\" as well as the title track. \n\nThe overall vibe on the album is relaxed and layed back. The band focused more on writing shorter songs and the music doesn't overbear on the listener. In other words, this is an easy album to listen to and despite the absence of standout epics, has everything that you'd come to expect from the band. The Hunter emphasizes on the guitar attack by guitarists Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher as well as vocals provided by all members. The result is a record that is a rocking slab of very good heavy metal. This is the work of a band that is confident with what they accomplished, and they embrace each new risk with confidence.\n\nIf you're new to the band, and are looking for a place to start, The Hunter is a perfect entry to the rest of their broad catalogue due to the fact that it showcases all the elements that have made Mastodon such a great metal act. The album is heavy as hell, and pushes the limits to what this band can do in the studio.\n",
        "\nI actually began listening to Mastodon when Remission was just released, and the band had most certainly garnered some attention, but nothing substantive and nothing they can carve a career out of. Remission was everything I wanted in a modern heavy metal album - it was fast, truculently defiant, fast and above all - the riffs just kicked ass. Metal had, in some ways, begun dying out for me. \n\nThe first thing that got me to start listening to this album was the artwork. Mastodon have a reputation for releasing brightly colored covers. This album has, by far, the best artwork I have ever seen on a heavy metal record. I confess to not really understanding what it means, I know there is a strong reference to Herman Melville's Moby Dick, but the artwork as a whole is beyond majestic - it is something I am not accustomed to seeing coming out of a heavy metal band.\n\nOnto the actual music on this record. Now that I've approached it with an open ear, I can make a far more convincing case as to why this is something you should purchase. First of all, this is most certainly a very raw but refined record. Mastodon have always had clear, unbelievably good production for a band that played music this heavy - but this is some of the best recording I have heard from them, even if it is a little chaotic. The guitar sounds harsh and pierces the ear, and unlike Remission, the bass is completely audible. \n\nAlso unlike Remission, Brann Dailor doesn't completely dominate the music. Remission lacks one thing that is so important to rock music, structure, and in part this was perpetrated by the virtuosic, emphatically elaborate drumming. However, sometimes you just wished Brann could hold a beat, and on this record he most certainly does so. Some songs do remind you heavily of the way Remission was written, \"Island\" being the best example of this, but the songs have a conventional pattern, rather than the youthful exuberance which carried the band through their earlier material, there is real maturity here. It is still quite raw heavy metal, but reserved and intelligible. There is a drawback to this, the record might not offer the same level of complexity that some fans might have expected, and a certain element of predictably lurks within, but nothing redundant. In fact, because the band have composed such brilliant riffs, alternating vocals and tight melody - the record never gets boring - but you need several listens to truly appreciate it. \n\nThe singing here is another notable departure from Remission, where the emphasis was on brutality rather than melody. Songs like \"Naked Burn\", \"Blood and Thunder\" and \"Seabeast\" have some down to earth, clean vocals which sound like something out of a hard rock record, a most sincere and positive change on this record - and reflects a deeper philosophy the band seemed to have; balance. On Remission, everything was fast paced or heavy, whilst here they've diversified significantly - it is definitely more accessible, but by no means a commercial record.\n\nTo conclude this review, this is a must have record for any genuine heavy metal fan. Remission was a classic, unbelievably genuine and brilliantly written album - but its not for everyone. This record broadens the horizons for Mastodon, and is certainly geared towards incorporating numerous traditional elements of heavy metal which have made this band the best modern metal group there is.\n",
        "\nTruth be told, because I hated Crack the Skye such an unfathomably large amount, I couldn't give even the minutest of fucks about The Hunter. In fact, I didn't listen to it until I decided to do this series, and even then I didn't bother with it until I'd finished writing on the four previous albums, so as to not taint anything or potentially warp my old perspective of the band. This was going to be a new experience for me, this was an entirely new album by a band I once really liked that had since fallen into the toilet, and the only bit I'd heard about it was that it was apparently lighter and more radio friendly. That's all I knew, no other preconceived notions.\n\nFrankly? It's okay. Certainly worlds better than fucking Crack the Skye, that's for sure.\n\nAt this point, Mastodon had proclaimed that they were tired of trying to be so heavy all the time (booo!) and instead were going to go in a direction that would allow them to have more fun with their music (yaaay!). I love fun music, I don't care how silly that makes me. It's why I listen to Blood Stain Child and The Decline and Gargoyle and Municipal Waste and Kvelertak and all kinds of other bands, because they're fun to listen to and I love that. Mastodon had dashes of fun here and there on songs like \"Megalodon\" and \"The Wolf is Loose\", but Crack the Skye was a tedious chore, and even if you liked the album, you certainly don't list \"fun\" as one of its qualities. That wasn't what they aimed for, so hearing that their new goal was to have some more fun with what they do for a living actually pumped me up quite a bit.\n\nThe final product here, with 2011's The Hunter, is actually pretty divisive, and yet at the same time pretty homogenous. This is a clear departure from the more matured (dull) and adventurous (meandering) direction they were taking with the previous album, so a large contingent of fans are going to have issues with how light this is compared to anything they'd done in the past (\"Curl of the Burl\", despite having a very catchy, bluesy main riff, catches a lot of shit in particular for this reason) right off the bat, but personally, I find the commercialism is overstated. I mean yeah, \"Curl of the Burl\" could be on the radio, but that's really about it. The rest of these tracks are all either too heavy or two weird for any substantial airplay, and they usually do pretty well for themselves depending on what they shoot for. There are some strange, trippy pieces like \"Stargasm\", \"The Hunter\", and \"The Sparrow\", and unsurprisingly those do pretty much nothing for me. I suppose they work for what they are, and they at least keep themselves for being shorter than your average drone track. Some tracks like to wander between the two styles on display, like \"All the Heavy Lifting\", but apart from the droning stoner chorus, that particular track is completely unmemorable. In fact, most of the album apart from the first three or four tracks until the last two or so are pretty unmemorable. Oh don't get me wrong, there are pieces that stand out, like the incredibly soothing \"Creature Lives\" (this song would have been terrible if attempted in a previous album. The laid back style and harmonized vocals work stunningly at this point in the band's career) or the blistering \"Spectrelight\", but most of The Hunter ends up being nary a blur after repeated listens.\n\nOf the two styles, I find the heavier stuff is far more memorable. \"Blasteroid\" is a Mastodon classic as far as I'm concerned, with an incredibly slick main riff, just oozing with bluesy charm, and the seemingly lost Blood Mountain b-side in \"Spectrelight\", which starts off blazing and never nods off. And then there is the bonus track, \"The Ruiner\". The fact that something incredibly tedious like the title track or \"Thickening\" wound up making the final cut while this fist pumping, bone crunching stomper was left out is nothing short of a mystery to me. It carries the most memorable chorus on the album, for Greek's sake (\"Heavy weeeiiighs thuuh crooow-ow-hooowwn\"). It's impossible to resist singing along with. When Mastodon said they were going to go in a less intellectual and more fun direction, this is the kind of track I was imagining. Leviathan/Blood Mountain mashups with big hooks and singalong vocal lines. You see, this is the kind of Mastodon I miss. The band that used to put all of their energy into every song, every bar, every note. That energy, that oh-so-missed showboating percussion, it's all but absent apart from three tracks that exude it marvelously. \"Blasteroid\", \"Spectrelight\", and \"The Ruiner\" are by far the best tracks on display, and the only other one I can even put in that same echelon (despite being a completely different style) is \"Creature Lives\". Four tracks. Four tracks from a band whose first three albums never dipped below six or seven total classics amongst a bunch of other pretty good songs.\n\nMastodon really reined it in here, and that rarely works to a band's advantage, especially when they built their base popularity around how aggressive and energetic the once were. Taking a band like Sex Pistols and telling them to write something more akin to Snow Patrol is going to end up sucking, and the same thing happened when Mastodon decided to try to be like Genesis. Thankfully, the overindulgence is mostly gone on The Hunter, but the tripped out psychedelic parts still rear their heads occasionally, and they still managed to not really work. It's clear that this is what the band wants to do at this point, but they still never figured out how to do it well. They've always been at their best when releasing all that energy they've built up, and yet their latest album finds them doing their best to avoid doing just that. This isn't really as poppy or commercial as it's advertised, but it's still just a sort of diluted version of what the band delivered on their last two albums. The huge dead streak in the middle of the album is a huge mark against it, but the first couple tracks are pretty decent, and there are four fantastic ones that would be live staples if I had my way (\"Blasteroid\", \"Creature Lives\", \"Spectrelight\", and \"The Ruiner\"), so it's not a worthless album. They're just missing their best elements, which really drags down the idea they were going for. \n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nI... I don't know what happened here. I really don't. Blood Mountain was a testament to what modern metal could be (I still don't know what to call Mastodon's style, so \"modern metal\" is just gonna have to be the big catch-all until I think of an appropriate title), and while each successive Mastodon release got a little bit less heavy (nothing was going to top the sheer weight of Remission, as flawed as the album may be), they were inventive and interesting and, most importantly, fantastic songwriters. They could take all these elements I'd normally abhor and somehow craft very infectious and memorable tunes around them. I really admired that ability, and no amount of overexposure or radio play is going to make me enjoy Blood Mountain or Leviathan less.\n\nBut the truth is, when Crack the Skye first came out, it pissed me off so much that I didn't listen to Mastodon at all for nearly four years. From the release date of this fourth album until the day I started this series, I didn't intentionally listen to a single note from this band.\n\nYes, Crack the Skye is really that fucking bad. All the kind of eccentric proggy elements I wasn't fond of but could appreciate how they made them blend with everything else before have taken center stage, and instead of aggressive barnburners and strong, catchy melodies and choruses, we are now inundated with long, spacy prog jams, and endless slow tapping melodies and 100% Mudvayne vocals. It blows my mind how they could have spent their first three albums constantly refining their sound, perfecting the little details and carving out their own specific niche, just to reach this point and go \"You know what? Fuck all that, we want a more intelligent audience, so let's just drop the heavy influences we have and instead focus on Genesis and Dream Theater and the light Opeth songs\". I'm not crying because they changed (hell, every previous album was distinctly different from its predecessor), I'm crying because the change they made sucks like a turbocharged hoover. \n\nThis reminds me a lot of what happened with Norwegian black metal hellions, 1349, with their fourth album (released two months after this here), Revelations of the Black Flame. Both bands had started off pretty raw and unrefined and then nailed their particular sound on their third albums, and then for their fourth had apparently just decided that they needed a change and completely abandoned what they were good at. 1349 did not play to their strengths by abandoning the frantically brutal and straightforward black metal and instead focusing on ambient, and Mastodon did not play to their strengths by abandoning the punchy heaviness and strong, hardnosed aggression and melody by instead focusing on longwinded and melodic prog rock. Mastodon taking a huge influence from Pink Floyd and King Crimson seems interesting at first, but when you actually hear it in action it just ends up horrendously depressing. A band as frantic and energetic as this just doesn't translate well to this laid back style of songwriting. The band never lets loose like they're so good at doing, and even Durgha spends all of his time in the background just giving very simple backing beats as opposed to the nigh endless showboating he's so well known for.\n\nSo the flair is toned down and it's a lot less showy, that doesn't necessarily mean it's inherently bad, right? Most of the time, sure, but here it's proven pretty early on that when Mastodon wanders outside of their established home base, they just end up lost and confused and have no idea what in the hell they're doing. All seven tracks here just kind of meander about without much cohesion between the individual instruments or the vocals. And oh yeah, the vocals are at their all time worst at this point. Not only is the Mudvayne voice the only real vocal lead (I still don't know which member sounds like individually, sue me, they're all similar), but it's also more nasally than ever before. It's like he has a dastardly head cold that they couldn't wait to heal because they'd already booked the studio time. The perplexingly popular \"Oblivion\" is a perfect showcase for such an issue, as that damn chorus repeats itself seemingly dozens of times, and his voice just grates and grates and grates and oh god make him stop Jesus Christ it's making my liver hurt somehow. The vocals usually just drone over the top of whatever flittery psychedelic passages are noodling around in the background, and it just lacks any semblance of memorability throughout the runtime of the entire album. It's bewildering, one of the band's main strengths in the past was writing the catchiest songs they could while using abrasive and seemingly incompatible elements, and yet here they focused on one style and managed to cock it up all-encompassingly. Mastodon is not Pink Floyd, they can't write songs like this and make them work. They tried, I can say they really obviously put their hearts into this album and I can appreciate such a personal and heartfelt effort, the problem is that it's totally ineffectual and they just can't get this sound down correctly. \n\nThere are moments that are passable, like the \"Let it gooo, LET IT GOOOO\" chorus of \"Quintessence\", and the heavier part near the end of the same track that reminds me of \"Capillarian Crest\" from the previous album, and there are sections here and there in the way-too-fucking-long-because-we're-actually-a-real-life-prog-band-now-aren't-you-proud-of-us-yet-dad? \"The Last Baron\". There's also one woefully short heavy segment about halfway through \"Ghosts of Karelia\" that works pretty well (probably because it's the most Blood Mountain-y segment on the album), but that's it. Three or four short sections throughout a fifty minute psychedelic prog rock jam session, and that's an awful average. Far too much of the album is spent trying to be all spacey and trippy and smart and it just ends up sounding so goddamn phony. Yeah, I just said that they obviously tried very hard, but I still feel like this is insincere in a way. To me, there are two ways this album came about; either the band was tired of the Adult Swim crowd they'd garnered and wanted to attract more \"intellectual\" fans, or they'd just finally reached cosmic levels of drug intake and decided to pay homage to all the pretty colors they'd been tasting for the last few years. Either way, it was a shitty idea and no amount of genuineness can change that. \n\nFunnily enough, I feel like the band understood the problems with the album, as there are instrumental versions of each song floating around out there somewhere and they've since released an EP which featured shortened versions of the two needlessly overlong tracks. Granted, the instrumental tracks were probably more to please the prog nerds/themselves and the abridged EP was probably the label's idea or their attempt to just cave in and please everybody, but either way they at least eliminate two of the bigger problems with the vocals and bad structuring. But even with those cut out, the album is still flawed on a conceptual level and falls flat on its face straight out of the gate. It's strange how when they take a bunch of different ideas and try mashing them up, they manage to craft some intense and hooky songs, but the instant they focus on one particular sound, they just completely bomb. Crack the Skye is a bad experiment, and a terrible progression that just went against everything the band had been building to and working towards. The laid back style doesn't at all work with the band's chemistry, and the album as a whole ends up sounding paradoxically unfocused and meandering despite being their first attempt to rein in their songwriting to one particular style. This is honestly offensively bad to the point where I abandoned the band entirely upon first listening to it, and to the shock of nobody, time has not sweetened it. They had been constantly improving up to this point, and then somehow managed to just wreck it in a fiery hodgepodge of shitty psychedelia and warbly nose-vocals. \n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nSo if Remission got Mastodon noticed and Leviathan made them popular, I'd say Blood Mountain solidified them as a premier mainstream metal band. Around this time, they were about as on top of the world as they could imagine. They managed to jump ship from Relapse (one of the biggest and most recognizable labels in metal) to Warner Bros, which is most certainly not known for their impressive roster of metal bands. So they went from a major label to a major label, and after ripping shit up on giant nationwide tours like Ozzfest, damn near everybody knew who they were at this point.\n\nPrime ingredients for a sellout, naturally.\n\nBlood Mountain says \"Fuck that\" and proceeds to hammer a whopping nine excellent tracks in a row into your skull before any real misstep. All that fine tuning that took place on Leviathan was perfected on this 2006 release, to the point where I'm not even sure what to consider it from a musical standpoint. I was never comfortable with referring to Mastodon as a sludge band, since to me, sludge is the stuff like Grief or Eyehategod, clearly worlds apart from our media darlings here, but at the very least I could understand why that tag got tacked on to them early on. But here? It's gone. They're like mid-era Death where I guess they could be called prog metal if you wanted to call them that, but they weren't really all the way there. I mean, there's still a huge High on Fire groove going on here, plus whatever other stoner and hardcore influences, but for the most part they've just kind of become their own nebulous entity at this point. In fact, mid-late-era Death is actually a pretty decent comparison at times when you think about how frequent the harmonized leads play a central role in the music. Almost every track is crammed full of minor tapping melodies and harmonized runs, very similar to what Chuck fell just a little bit too much in love with around the Individual Thought Patterns era. And of course, Kali is still the drummer, so there are still an abundance of skin pounding theatrics.\n\nI'll admit, I was being slightly facetious when I said that we get nine tracks in a row before the album ever stumbles, as \"Sleeping Giant\" is merely a shorter version of those long stoner jams I disliked so much on Remission, but it manages to keep pace with the rest of the album and doesn't overstay its welcome. It ends up being a neat little idea as opposed to a flow breaking intrusion, so I can't really stay mad at it. In fact, the album as a whole actually contains a lot of singular experimental ideas that I'd normally despise, but mostly work out pretty well, like the trippy jam of \"Sleeping Giant\", the weird talkbox insanity in \"Bladecatcher\", and most obviously that stupid fucking Tron voice that Cynic used so much on \"Circle of Cysquatch\". Oh man that will never sound cool. Seriously, somebody needs to sit on some council that reviews every single recorded album before it's released, and if they hear the Tron voice they should give the bands a light slap on the bottom with a fucking sledgehammer. The last quarter of the album suffers a bit too from being much more laid back than the rest of the album, not to mention a frankly bizarre vocal performance by the Mars Volta guy in \"Siberian Divide\". Plus \"Pendulous Skin\" has that fucking stupid thing that bands do where they tack a bunch of silence on to the end of the album just to stick in some little joke at the end. Man that shit can fuck itself with dynamite. It's normally pretty easy to ignore but it's so bloody pointless that I can't help but get upset with it.\n\nThose quibbles aside, everything else about the album is great. There are an abundance of guitar solos (at least in comparison to their early work) and they're all tasteful and well done, the riffs are among the the most infectious they'd ever write, and the songwriting in general is just leaps and bounds ahead of where they were before. I mean, nothing was written poorly on the previous album, but here it's written superbly. Every track flows beautifully from one section to another, never feeling like a haphazard mess despite each track containing so many different ideas. The overwhelming heaviness is mostly gone, replaced instead with a very infectious and aggressive, yet still fairly poppy mentality. Everything here can pretty safely be considered inoffensive while still clearly being hard, heavy, and aggressive, and it's rare that a metal band can manage to strike such a remarkable balance between legitimacy and accessibility. Mastodon here nails it, with the kinda-progressive-kinda-stoner-not-really-sure style lashing out both extreme melody, extreme aggression, and weirdly effective (for a change) psyched out trippy parts, though they're still the weakest link of the album. The neat style of riffing that Mastodon had always used but never really established as their own finally comes to life here, coming off as a high energy mix of High on Fire and Between the Buried and Me. \"The Wolf is Loose\" pretty much sums up the entire album in a nutshell, with it's blisteringly high octane pace, ascending bridges, and vocals split pretty evenly between the manic shouts of the past and the Mudvayne voice of the future. The album on the whole seems to use that goddamn Mudvayne voice most of the time, but at this point it's still firmly in the territory of Mastodon, and doesn't sound as silly as it could.\n\nApart from that beast of an opener, there is the \"hit single\" in \"Colony of Birchmen\", which is a great, midpaced melodic number with a very catchy main riff and instantly memorable chorus. It's moments like this that foreshadow the more melodic and accessible direction Mastodon was pointing towards, and yet it showed how great they could potentially be with such a mindset. Then there are tracks like \"Capillarian Crest\", which show case a more progressive, aggressive style, rife with tapping leads and frantic melodies. Again, it showed that they were pretty good at most of the styles they toyed around with, even though they were mainly just reaching to other areas for inspiration in their own defined sound, as opposed to trying desperately to appeal to everybody. Despite it's weirdness, my favorite track my actually be the instrumental \"Bladecatcher\". It flows in a very creative fashion from each disparate section to the next, and the fast part with the weird whammy-ing talkbox strangeness just manages to work masterfully. I wish I could explain how so many different, noodly sections end up sounding so brilliant to me, a guy who generally can't stand noodly prog, but Mastodon somehow manages to master it by basing the music instead around an accessible stoner/prog/modernwhatever hybrid. \"Hand of Stone\" also gets special mention for the surprisingly thrashy riff it closes on.\n\nBlood Mountain can basically just be summed up as \"Mastodon\". That's it, this is what Mastodon had been building towards since their inception, and it just reached its apex here. I'm still not entirely sure what genre to classify this as, as to my knowledge it's a style that started getting aped later by horrid modern bands that Liquid Metal likes to fellate. Give it a listen, if only for the fact that it's one of the few definitively \"modern\" metal albums I can think of that both completely exemplifies the new sound of heavy music in the mainstream and is also not utter shit. Mastodon managed to somehow strike gold here, and they were certainly on the upswing. They'd hit their stride, surely they'd ride the momentum and creativity from this album into an illustrious career as both media darlings and legitimately good songwriters, right?\n\nRIGHT?!\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nSo while Remission gave Mastodon some mainstream recognition (being released on Relapse certainly helped, and \"March of the Fire Ants\" received decent rotation on music channels), it's really hard to debate that their real breakthrough album was anything other than Leviathan. If you watched Fuse or listened to any hard rock/metal radio station or used internet radio or anything of the sort back in 2004, there was no escaping \"Blood and Thunder\" or \"Iron Tusk\". This shit was ubiquitous, no doubt about it. And that's great and all, I thought Remission was pretty decent but had a few issues with overlong stoner jams, so seeing that Leviathan only has one track I could consider to be of a long length (though it's twice as long as the longest track on the previous album) filled me with some rare optimism.\n\nLong story short, yeah this definitely fixed my biggest problem with Mastodon's debut. Gone are the overly dragging, droning, no-seriously-guys-we're-totally-a-prog-band jams (\"Hearts Alive\" not withstanding), replaced almost entirely with those mid to fast paced rockers I enjoyed so much. Paradoxically, the hardcore influence has been toned down dramatically as well. I still won't be upset at somebody labeling this album or the band as a metalcore band, but the noisy chaos is much more reined in this time around, with the riffwork being more controlled and precise. It's more melodic on the whole as well, and is absolutely loaded with dueling harmonized lead lines, which eventually became one of the band's trademarks, if you ask me. One element that was retained, thankfully, was Dailor's completely overdone yet charismatic drumming. I understand why people hate this guy, but I personally adore his buttnards, fill-happy technique. It gives the band identity (oh they're the band with the Shokan meth-head drummer, right?) and keeps the songs moving forward. Mastodon is no stranger to the stoner metal tendency of repeating riffs far more often than they'd logically need to be repeated, but with Dailor's nonstop filling, it makes the music go by without dragging on, and that's wholly welcome.\n\nNow then, if the stoner jams are toned down and the progginess is toned down and the hardcore is toned down, doesn't that mean we have a much more restrained and bland album on our hands? In a way, kind of. This is certainly much less off-the-wall than its predecessor, but I look at it as more \"homogenized\" or \"focused\" than \"bland across the board\". To me, Remission had a ton of ideas, and only half of them really stuck, whereas Leviathan is the band learning from that experience and instead funneling their songwriting talents into the shorter, punchier tracks this time around. There are remnants of that early fire here and there, with \"Hearts Alive\" being a thirteen minute jam, taking nearly all of the leftover elements they kept from shoehorning into the other songs and just cramming them all into one track. The slight bluesy elements rear their heads occasionally as well (\"Megalodon\" is the most blatant example) and \"Island\" gets a giant helping of that chaotic noise that the rest of the album manages to shy away from. But for the most part, this is a much more focused and song oriented effort, jam packed with memorable riffs and melodies.\n\nHowever, there is one major, major issue that began on this album and would plague the band for the rest of their career. That would be the fucking Mudvayne vocals. I have no idea how I'm apparently the only person who hears the Chad Gray impression in the clean vocals, but if you can't hear it in \"Naked Burn\", then I have no idea what to tell you. I get that Mastodon is a cool band and Mudvayne is a lame one so there's no way you can ever compare something good to something bad, but even huge opponents of the band who will find anything crazy to say about how much they suck and are a blight on the landscape of heavy metal seem to think I'm off my rocker with that comparison. It only becomes more prevalent with subsequent releases, apparently due to the vocalist(s) blowing out his/their voice(s) and being unable to scream anymore, which is a shame but the point stands that the dirty croon of the clean vocals remind me of fucking Mudvayne so it can be distracting sometimes.\n\nBut other than that and the production being more polished (which normally doesn't bother me but it comparison to Remission this sounds kind of tame) and the songs being much less dense and heavy than before (thanks to the band abandoning the old tunings), Leviathan manages to be a good improvement upon its predecessor. Where Remission had clear standouts (\"Crusher Destroyer\", \"March of the Fire Ants\", \"Burning Man\") and clear weak points (\"Trilobite\", \"Ole' Nessie\", \"Trainwreck\"), Leviathan stands as a more consistently enjoyable effort, with the only low point being the needlessly overlong \"Hearts Alive\". Sorry guys, but you just are not as good at this long, drawn out epic style than you are at the short, to the throat rockers.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nOne of the biggest metal bands in the mainstream of today (and I mean the real mainstream. The shit capable of charting and the kinds of bands that people who just watch MTV for Jersey Shore reruns might have heard of) is of course, Atlanta's Mastodon. I decided to start this series for a few reasons. One was that I used to be a huge fan of the band. Really, their first three albums were always in fairly regular rotation from about 05-08, and I think it'd be fun for me to take a trip down memory lane. The other is because the reason this is a trip down a long forgotten path instead of a simple retrospective is because I haven't listened to them at all for the last four years. Yes, Crack the Skye was so unbearably awful that it somehow managed to make everything before it sound like shit to me. It was like The Matrix sequels. And since I've stopped listening to them, they apparently became the new Metallica, so curiosity is leading me to re-explore and re-evaluate the band's career in some attempt to understand how in the everloving fuck that wound up happening to a band that managed to squander away their songwriting capabilities so marvelously. So welcome, my friends, to Mainstream Extinction: The Story of Mastodon, and BastardHead's Expert Opinion on Why You are Probably Wrong.\n\nSo in 2002, after gathering up a huge amount of buzz via their two EPs the previous year (Slick Leg and Lifesblood), Mastodon managed to sign to the legendary Relapse Records, and start their career already a few steps ahead of most young, innovative new bands. And their debut, Remission, actually holds up pretty well, even a decade later. What this presented was a very hungry young band, out to set the world on fire. Remission manages to do just that, with it's insanely chaotic approach to extreme music, dashed with influences of hardcore, sludge, and bluesy southern rock.\n\nBack at this time, for those of you who got into metal around the time Dragonforce was wrapping up production on their fourth album (never has a young person felt so old than in the metal scene!), there really wasn't a whole lot like Mastodon in the early 00s. There were chaotic bands, there were noisy bands, there were sludgy, heavy, and bluesy bands, but few that wrapped all of it up in such a nice, appealing package in the way that this band did. Even less so getting frequent airplay on MTV and a major label hype machine. So at the time, this really was a cool experience. The long, psyched out jam in \"Elephant Man\" was so different from the thunderously heavy \"Crusher Destroyer\" which was so different from the unremittingly dense \"Where Strides the Behemoth\". It's a very fun, flavorful album, with enough running threads and common themes between tracks to keep the varied experience cohesive.\n\nThe one aspect that absolutely cannot be ignored is Brann Dailor's absolutely frantic drumming. Bill Ward once said that the reason he injected Black Sabbath with so many drum fills was because he had trouble keeping time, and so throwing in a fill every few bars gave him the ability to break into free time for a short while so he could collect himself and get back to where he needed to be. I don't doubt Dailor is more than competent enough to be able to keep time like a human metronome, but he emulates Ward so closely in the frequency, diversity, and intensity of his fills here that I can't help but wonder. One sad, lonely evening as a teenager, I actually sat down and listened to the first two Mastodon albums to see how long they went without a drum fill, and I'm pretty sure my calculations ended up being somewhere around \"every four bars, twelve seconds being the longest gap between them\". He really ends up being the leader of this band despite being the only member not to contribute vocals. His showy, flashy style ends up being one of the most memorable elements of the early albums, and this doesn't bother me in the slightest since he's very skilled, and it helps add memorability to his performance. So even if I ended up fucking hating this album, at least I wouldn't forget it. I would at the very least remember the complete spaz of a drummer.\n\nAnd luckily enough, I don't hate this album. In fact I feel like it's quite good, and has managed to stand the test of time as an enjoyable modern metal album. It's hard to pigeonhole Remission into any one particular subgenre of music. There are definitely huge heaping helpings of High on Fire in here, such as \"Where Strides the Behemoth\" and \"Trainwreck\", and not to mention the slightly prog rock styled darkness of the acoustic segments in \"Ole' Nessie\", \"Trilobite\", and \"Elephant Man\". Unsurprisingly though, I feel the best tracks are the shorter, faster ones; the ones where the band just completely lets loose and delivers a chaotic, frenzied experience complete with memorable riffs and melodies. \"Crusher Destroyer\" is an absolute fucking monster of a track, as are \"Burning Man\", \"Mother Puncher\", and \"Workhorse\", and they contain some of the most memorable riffs of the entire experience (topped only by the more crushing, mid paced number of \"March of the Fire Ants\"). Unfortunately, they also stand out the most because the long tripped out songs are pretty fantastically dull.\n\nYeah, \"Ole' Nessie\", \"Trainwreck\", and \"Trilobite\" do a decent job of keeping the flow of the album going, but as tracks themselves they're just needlessly boring. I get a feeling that the \"progressive\" part of their genre comes from tracks like this, the long ones that drone on endlessly with jazzy percussion and long sections of harmonized lead lines. They don't make the entire album boring, thankfully, and they're each spaced out by putting a fast, catchy song in between them all, but if you're not leaving the album on in the background or something (like say... reviewing it), they can be really tiresome and frustrating. The band's strength lies in the fast and the midpaced, and most of these songs are indeed midpaced, but when their ideas are stretched out for too long, they tend to lose their luster, and that sucks because it means the album periodically loses steam after the first four tracks finish. They're just... not very interesting to listen to, and when you couple that with the completely inconsequential vocals, you find yourself listening to drum fills for seven minutes at a time. Yeah, the band would be better off in the future when they dropped the idea of putting multiple long droning tracks on each album.\n\nOverall the first four tracks are all great, with a strong High on Fire type stoner metal vibe, mixed in with healthy amounts of noisy hardcore and a very subtle southern sludge flavor, with \"Burning Man\" and \"Mother Puncher\" doing the same on the latter half of the album. The more progressive songs, on the other hand, are kinda lame. You can do without the five tracks that aren't the six I just mentioned, as they're really inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. If nothing else, it's a very dense and suffocatingly heavy album for most of it's duration, even during the boring songs, and it serves as a neat reminder of the band's roots in hindsight, because they never got heavier than this. I most certainly would not have expected Mastodon to become one of the biggest and most popular ambassadors for heavy music in the media's eye based on this inhumanly thick and impenetrable album, that's for sure.\n\n\nOriginally written for http://lairofthebastard.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nThis album divides people, surely. Mastodon have been known for their long songs which are usually progressive/rock based, but also screeching vocals, insane drums and chugging riffs which has been their hallmark for over a decade. Although they've always been a somewhat experimental band, this is probably their most experimentalist record thus far. The Hunter has everything a metal fan would dream off; although I am not taking into consideration the purists who would undoubtedly prefer their debut, Remission, and gave up Mastodon once they began trying out other ideas. Mastodon seem to be keen on developing their sound organically, as opposed to becoming another Metallica who kind of sold their core fan base out almost completely. \n\nFirst of all, let me completely disregard the myth that this album is not heavy. This is patently untrue, anyone who gives this a listen even once will notice there are some very Mastodon based elements here. \"Black Tongue\", \"All The Heavy Lifting\", \"Stargasm\", \"Bedazzled Fingernails\", \"Spectrelight\" and \"Thickening\" are all heavy songs, and you're quite unwilling to grant them even the slightest amount of room to experiment if you believe otherwise. If one believes Remission is Mastodon's only good record, then it is advised that you stay away from this album at all costs\n\nNow the vocals are a little different, which will take anyone by surprise. Some of the aforementioned songs (amongst others), are very melodic and the singing always in tune. There is a fair amount of grunting in here, but both Troy and Hinds continue with the style they used on Crack The Skye, except here it's even better. \"Stargasm\", \"Octopus Has No Friends\", \"Bedazzled Fingernails\" and \"All The Heavy Lifting\" have some of the best singing I have ever heard on a heavy metal album. Some fans might find the singing far too melodic however, but even as a loyal death metal fan, this was a nice development in what has been a truly indefatigable career for Mastodon. \n\nNow the production here is perfect, the bass is audible at all times, and on a few tracks Troy's bass playing really stands out, it isn't virtuosic, but extremely fitting with the music. The guitars lean more towards hard rock than heavy/thrash metal, although that classic Mastodon style remains ever more obvious on this record, even more than \"Crack The Skye\". There are a few decent solos, particularly on the title track, but unfortunately, there just aren't enough solos on this record - which is something you get used to listening to Mastodon. The drumming is also a lot more tuned down, and this is perhaps where Mastodon have really changed as a band - Dailor is extremely entertaining, but his drum lines are a lot more mellow and feel based rather than the insanity we've grown accustomed to. \n\nNow for the negatives, and there are a couple. As previously mentioned, this is a difficult record for anyone to get into if they're not ready to listen to a lot of melodic singing thats not just grunting, and I can imagine Mastodon getting considerably more attention than ever before because of this fact. Also, none of the songs even come close to six minutes, which is a rare thing for a band like Mastodon, because one of the biggest reasons I liked about Mastodon was that they could write an 8 minute song that was never boring. \n\nAlso, a couple of tracks don't really sound like they belong on this record as a whole. \"The Creature\" for example, I felt doesn't truly serve a purpose in this album, and kind of threw me off track, while \"Curl of The Burl\" was a catchy rock song, it felt like it was purposefully put in there to get some radio play. If it wasn't for the uniquely definitive strengths this album possesses, I would have given a lower rating. In addition, the album is sometimes a little predictable. Songs here also structurally simpler, and follow the almost mundane progression of verse, chorus and then verse again. This is in sharp contrast to all things Mastodon. Things is not something that hinders the album, but it does make it far more accessible, so thats something to be aware off.\n\nFinally, this is a thoroughly enjoyable record, that classic Mastodon sound is pervasive and there is plenty of diversity here. Some songs are unbelievably heavy like \"Black Tongue\" and \"Spectrelight\" while others are more musical such as the title track and \"Stargasm\". Its ultimately the kind of album I expected Mastodon to release, and presumably they'll proceed in this direction for the future. This is exactly the kind of stuff this band needs to be writing, a diversely experimental album which doesn't conform to any single stereotype. I strongly recommend this album for any real heavy metal fan.\n",
        "\nThey say a band's third album is their defining record, pieces of music elegantly grafted together at its very best, but this is not the case for this record. Mastodon have showed that they are an experimental band and that they're not afraid to try outrageous new ideas, even if it means that they go against the underground where they most certainly emerged from. Crack The Skye is perhaps the bands most progressive record and also the first one on which deploy a lot of clean, melodic singing. Gone are the days when Troy growled into the microphone like a monomaniac and the days when Dailor lead the entire song. There is certainly a lot of growling and screeching, but it's far more refined and composed.\n\nAs previously mentioned, this record is very different from anything Mastodon have released before. First off, you have a single like \"Oblivion\", which will strike any avid Mastodon listener by surprise. However, the band manages to pull off this weird concoction of prog rock and pop-sounding vocals with a nice twist, making it an unbelievably energetic track and a fantastic introduction to the album. However, this is hardly the template for the record, which is actually very diverse and quite technical. What is most important, however, is to realize the song structures here are a lot less predictable and sometimes even extensive and demand a lot of from the listener. \"The Last Baron\", for example, is an indefatigable track with all kinds of lush surprises, is around 13 minutes in length, and most tracks go on past the five minute mark. \n\nThe drums on this record are also far less hectic than previous records and my intuition is that Dailor has had to reform his style for the sake of such a concept record (which is actually about the suicide of his sister), making this record a more conventional progressive record than the mysterious strain of heavy metal Mastodon endorsed on their previous records. Make no mistake, the drumming is extremely interesting, progressively- based, and Dailor is a master of his craft, keeping things spectacularly interesting throughout the duration of the album. Interestingly, the guitars really stand out on this record, making it one of Mastodon's most interesting. There is a ton of hybrid picking in this and on the track \"Divinations\"; you almost get a death metal, Necrophagist-like feeling to the main riff, which is absolutely awesome.\n\nFinally, this in a sense bares a lot of new ideas that worked fabulously well for Mastodon. They're unbelievable singers and musicians who can write a 10 minute-plus song with deep intricacies and melancholic tales of failure and isolation, but also a catchy four minute track. The band have truly matured with this record, with every instrument standing out and the songwriting is being taken to another level. Be prepared to indulge yourself in Mastodon's most despondent, yet articulate record, and by far their crowning masterpiece.\n",
        "\nSludge/prog metal masters returned in 2009 with their newest album, Crack the Skye. Three years prior, they released Blood Mountain, which is a totally different cup of tea than this album. In fact, this album is a step in a completely different direction than Mastodon's other albums. Each of Mastodon's albums contains a different theme, musically and lyrically. Remission is fire, Leviathan is water, Blood Mountain is earth, and Crack the Skye is aether (which is actually not a real element, but a 'classical' element that was used a long time ago to represent the matter that fills space). For Mastodon to capture this feeling of space and vast emptiness and astral travel, they needed to change it up a bit musically. I've read a handful of reviews on this album and the thing people seem to be disappointed with (among other things) is the direction they took with this album. Trying to write a concept album on the themes listed above with the same feeling and techniques used in something like Leviathan or Remission simply just will not work, and that is why Mastodon took a way more proggy approach to this album than any others. \n\nTaking influences from Pink Floyd, Crack the Skye is a very deep album on all accounts. The title of the album is a homage to drummer Brann Dailor's sister Skye who committed suicide at age 14. He said the amount of feelings he experienced at the time was enough to crack the sky. That's some heavy stuff, and paying homage to her with an album such as this is very cool as it can make her memory eternal. \n\nSomething I noticed on this album immediately is that there is a constant feeling that something is really not right at all, coupled with a spacey, psychedelic vibe. This doesn't go away even after years of listening to this album (I got this album when it came out in March of '09 because I thought the cover looked cool), and even now as I listen to it again for the thousandth time I notice little things that I haven't before. Whether it be a bass line from Troy, a particular drum pattern from Brann, or certain riffs from guitarists Brent or Bill, it's very cool and there are lots of nice little touches on this album.\n\nMy favourite thing on this album is definitely Brann Dailor's drumming. He is an excellent drummer and one of my favourites. His drumming feels very natural, whether it be lightning fast and thrashy or slow and atmospheric, which is showcased on Crack the Skye. One thing that I would like to mention to newcomers to Mastodon is that you should try to listen to each of Mastodon's records with an open mind. I found it hard to get past Brent Hind's howling vocals, but it eventually grew on me and I really enjoy them now. \n\nIn short, Mastodon's fourth album, Crack the Skye, is an excellent trip through space and time. With a wonderful concept, lyrics, and instrumentation, it's something everybody should listen to at least once.\n\nFavourite tracks:\nDivinations\nThe Czar\nGhost of Karelia\n",
        "\nAfter springing into existence fully-formed with the fantastic progressive post-sludge (or whatever) of Remission, Mastodon injected more melody and ambition into its accomplished and worthy follow-up, Leviathan. Their proggy tendencies became even more prominent on Blood Mountain, though they weren't really sure what to do with the influence.\n\nThis is a frustrating record because some of the tracks are excellent, some have fantastic parts mixed with moments of questionable taste, and there are a couple outright overreaches. The opening track \"The Wolf Is Loose\" and single \"Crystal Skull\" are particularly raging examples of what Mastodon's best at: heavy, catchy riffing, bonkers drumming, and impassioned vocal delivery. The melodic singing is integrated well in these tracks, just as it was on \"Naked Burn\" from their previous record.\n\nThe problems start when those first two tracks end. Mastodon clearly wanted to branch out and try new things, but they mar songs with a goofy spoken word section (\"Sleeping Giant\"), a sore-thumb robot voice (\"Circle of Cysquatch\"), a honky-tonk country lick (\"This Mortal Soil\"), a pitch-shifted Cedric Bixler-Zavala (\"Siberian Divide\"), and dumb fantasy lyrics (almost every song.) There's \"Bladecatcher,\" a cool title desparately seeking a song. Some of Mastodon's earlier songs, such as \"Trainwreck,\" \"Workhorse,\" and \"Hearts Alive,\" had evocative and emotional lyrics that made the band more than just a kick-ass metal group, but they all but abandoned earnestness with this record and embraced fantasia and nonsense.\n\nIt became clear on this album that none of the members of Mastodon has a strong melodic singing voice. Anyone who has seen Mastodon live in the last six or seven years or listened to their Live at the Aragon album can attest to this, and it's been painful to see them descend from one of the most powerful live metal bands in the U.S. to a bunch of dudes straining to hit the high notes. There's lots of clean singing on Blood Mountain, and though it's been Pro-Tooled to melodic accuracy, it doesn't suit their strengths. Troy Sanders' roar is the best vocal delivery for their sound, and there isn't nearly enough of it.\n\nWhen it was released, Blood Mountain broke my heart. They lost the impeccable taste that made their first two records such unimpeachable statements and wandered into the wilderness. Though some sharp riffage remained, the power of their sound was diluted by the missteps and the album fell short of their previous accomplishments.\n",
        "\nMastodon's \"Remission\" is certainly one of the most criminally-misunderstood and underrated heavy metal albums, although with the band's newly garnered popularity and expansion of its fan base, it's certainly gotten a lot more attention at this point. I remember first listening to this album some 10 years ago when I was looking for something new, fresh, and that wasn't death metal/Pantera or anything like that. I came across this beast and couldn't put it down for about 6 months. I decided to pick it up again recently and give it a listen and boy, have I been missing out. \n\nFirst of all, Mastodon is far, far from your average heavy metal band. This album is full of riffs of all sorts, nothing virtuoso, but they're still fairly talented. That being said, a lot of the leading comes from the drummer, Brann Dailor, who has already brandished himself as one of the best heavy metal drummers in the modern era. This is an immediate turn-off for many heavy metal fans and reviewers, but I find it quite refreshing and a new idea that has never been tried or executed as appropriately. What you get is that a lot of the riffs either repeat themselves or move to a different octave and you always get some kind of capitulation - classic, right? Except it doesn't sound this way with Brann Dailor. I would say he's the mastermind behind this album. \n\nNow, the vocals are a little strange and I am fairly certain no one can sing like that live, and based on what I've seen, that's definitely true. The vocals are very powerful, although nearly incomprehensible for the most part. This is perhaps a second reason why this album has received less praise as it should, because the vocals sometimes border death metal, although this album is not an extreme metal album. While modern Mastodon vocals are characterized by a lot of clean, harmonious singing, this stuff is full of grind and grit, therefore fans of the more commercial stuff have been warned. \n\nThe songs are genuinely well-written and the riffs are extremely catchy. I would say Brent and Bill have really showed the signs of their riffing genius early on as a lot of the riffs on this record are very catchy and very well-phrased. Again, it's the drums that really take control of the record, but do not overlook how well some of these riffs are played. My only qualm with this album is that, unfortunately, Mastodon aren't great soloists. While classic heavy metal bands like Metallica, Pantera, Megadeth, and hell, even Slayer have come up with some great solos (especially the first two bands), this album doesn't really have any good solo work at all, not even mindless shredding like you'd expect. I also must say the bass is almost inaudible, which is to be expected given how distorted the guitars are.\n\nOverall, this is a classic album. It does have its shortcoming and for the heavy metal xenophobes out there, it can be a little intimidating and, dare I say, pretty sophisticated for the audience it is intended for. But nonetheless, this is a fine debut album by one of the modern greats within this profound genre of music. If you've listened to \"The Hunter\" and \"Crack The Skye\", prepare to be pleasantly surprised.\n",
        "\nWell, as the saying goes, the third times always the charm. And with Blood Mountain, the band has shown us they\u2019re able to whip out another fantastic album with a bunch of new surprises sprinkled throughout, and yet stay true to their roots.\n\nReleased on September 11, 2006 in Europe and the day after in North America, Blood Mountain did extremely well. Total Guitar ranked it the number one album of 2006, while magazines like Kerrang! and Metal Hammer thought it was just was epic as Leviathan, if not better. It was also featured on many websites' and magazines' 2006 countdowns. It was also Mastodon\u2019s third highest debut on Billboard 200, at #32, behind Crack the Skye and The Hunter. Guitarist Bill Kelliher considered this album to represent the earth element, and at the time, bassist Troy Sanders said it was \"sonically the best album we have done.\"\n\nThe story behind Blood Mountain is relatively simple. The main character wants to place the Crystal Skull at the top of Blood Mountain, but along the way deals with the problems, that according to bassist Troy Sanders, that can happen when \u2018you\u2019re stranded on a mountain, lost in the woods, and you\u2019re lost.\u2019 And on their DVD, it was said that the Crystal Skull is supposed to eliminate \u2018the reptilian brain\u2019, allowing its owner to have the ability to achieve the next step of human evolution. \n\nSonically, I liked this album a LOT more than Remission and Leviathan for a few reasons. Firstly, I loved the raw emotion found on Remission, and was a little disappointed when Leviathan didn\u2019t have the same intensity. With that being said, Leviathan allowed more influences, like sludge, prog, and I even dare to say a little old fashioned heavy metal to seep into the sound and it was the diversity in the overall sound I enjoyed the most. Blood Mountain was a good medium between the two \u2013 the sheer rage from Remission and the well-rounded, developed sound of Leviathan married quite well. I really enjoyed \u2018Crystal Skull\u2019, especially with the tribal-sounding drum intro, and the guest vocals of Scott Kelly just top it off. \u2018Sleeping Giant\u2019 is another favourite; I like the vocal rhythms in it, and it seems to allude to what they\u2019ll be doing in Crack the Skye. And opening with \u2018The Wolf is Loose\u2019 was a good call on their part \u2013 the drum solo in the beginning instantly reminded me of \u2018Blood and Thunder\u2019 and got my blood pumping. It got me so excited for what the rest of the album also had in store, and it didn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nIf you were just to give Blood Mountain just a quick skim, it would sound like this: 70\u2019s prog rock and Meshuggah meet up with NWOBHM and get drunk with some good old fashioned thrash metal. There are also some outbursts of guitar virtuosity (which never is overdone in Mastodon\u2019s case), and great atmospheric pieces, like the intro of \u2018Sleeping Giant\u2019.\n\nIt should also be noted that there was a significant improvement in the lyrics. The vocabulary wasn\u2019t a problem; it wasn\u2019t as simplistic as the stuff found on Remission, but at the same time, it wasn\u2019t insanely technical and difficult like what some tech death metal bands do. For me, it was more of how the ideas were presented that Mastodon got better at. For some of the songs, in particular, \u2018Hunters of the Sky\u2019 and \u2018Siberian Divide\u2019, feel more like miniature stories as opposed to older songs found on their older material. I like that!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed Blood Mountain. I love the story, I love the sound, and I love the lyrics. I love it all! After a miniature disappointment with Leviathan, I was glad to find Mastodon had found their footing within the metal scene with Blood Mountain, and I think the scene was happy they were able to come out with another fantastic album.\n",
        "\nThis album, like much of Mastodon's catalogue, never sits completely well with me through repeated listens. I think it's because I never got the vocals when Troy puts his weird nasal touch to them. That being said, the production on this release is pretty masterful. The vocals are mixed so well that I can forget how grating they were at some moments on Crack the Skye, a release that I did not enjoy as much as some due to the somewhat overbearing song-lengths and weird prog behavior (but above all, the instruments just felt... Wrong. guitars too high-ended, same with the vocals, and drums seeming almost machinelike)... But that's not the album I'm reviewing here. \n\nThe odd thing about The Hunter is that it's very consistent. It is EXACTLY what I would expect Mastodon to sound like if they toned the intensity factor down a touch. I believe a reviewer called it \"Mastodon's 'Black Album'\", and I'm not going to argue that point. The songs are much more radio-length, the BPM appears to have been toned down considerably, and songs sound not quite as... Heavy, or spirited if you will. Going with the analogy here, Crack the Skye is a lot like And Justice for all in that I disliked the production on both. Obviously for different reasons, as Justice just sounded monotonous and bassless. Though both have the longest songs of their respective catalogues, for better or for worse.\n\nThen there's the tracks. They're placed in such a way that if you're like me and don't skip tracks unless the album loses steam halfway through, you won't be hitting 'stop'. I was tempted on the three tracks \"Dry Bone Valley\", \"Thickening\", and \"Creature Lives\", however I did not. The first two didn't have much to offer... \"Dry Bone Valley\" sounds like a b-side to Skye with its and had sort of a repetitive vibe to it. \"Thickening\" gets my cringe shakes out, with somewhat lackluster and repetitive lyrics (\"Wrapped up like a baby\"), and the instrumentation is nothing to cry home about... But the solid production, catchy melody and interesting guitar solos near the end save both from going below a 6. \"Creature Lives\", on the other hand, would be the worst track on the album if not for the killer synth and really nice choir effects about halfway through. Aside from that, it just never gets much steam. The only other song I really felt like skipping was \"Octopus has no Friends\", which again has that 'we've heard it before on Skye, and we didn't like it much then either' feel, but it's short and placed between pretty solid (but not fantastic) tracks.\n\nBut enough about what I dislike, here's the real highlights of The Hunter. \"Curl of the Burl\", while definitely single-material, does what the band wanted with a lot of these songs, but fell back a bit time and again with a generic feel. The riffs are sludgy, the vocals very reminiscent of Ozzy in Troy's crooning, and I'd say it's the catchiest song on the album, frankly. A lot of times, when the band goes into 'spacey bridge mode', I get bored, but it's well-placed and doesn't overstay. \"Blasteroid\" and \"Spectrelight\", the third and third-last tracks respectively, show a more restrained yet agressive Mastodon, the former having excellent speed variation and some of the most intense screams I've heard from them, though I think it's mostly from layering. \"Spectrelight\" Has a nice hectic flow all the way through, and a touch of nice progressive drum syncopation raises its head here and there. \"Bedazzled Fingernails\" is by far, the best track on the album, I'd say. Good synth, AWESOME almost-robotic vocals in the chorus, giving a serious epic feeling to the whole thing... Rather than sounding like a b-side to the previous album... It almost seems to perfect the formula without breaking the ten-minute mark. Then comes \"The Sparrow\", a nearly-instrumental with a single line repeated inoffensively with some really nice variation in intensity behind it. It builds through 2/3rds of the song, and stays interestingly varied throughout, the melody in the vocals a treat.\n\nAs for the rest of the album, there's not much left to discuss. The songs stand inbetween the stinkers and the shiners, obviously, but you get a real 'take-it-or-leave-it' feel. Catchy and Mastodon enough to keep spinning, but not... Spectacular. Between this and Crack the Skye, there's a definite vibe of the band overdoing it a bit. It may sound like I love bashing The Hunter's predecessor, but it was a solid album as well. Sure, some songs just dragged more than I'd like. But here, with this output, the issue seems to be that there's just too many tracks. All the same, they remain (mostly) catchy and addictive. I'd recommend the album to fans of the melodic side of Mastodon, and less of the more abrasive qualities, though there is some heaviness to be found here and there.\n",
        "\nI don't usually write here but for Mastodon I'll make an exception, as few bands seem quite so divisive. Fans on one side rampantly defend their every questionable action thinking they're the best thing since bacon whilst haters think they're... well whatever the opposite of bacon is. Metaphors sadly aren't my fort\u00e9. Am I the perfect intermediary for this argument? No, probably not; I think they began pretentious and now they're overrated and pretentious, yet somewhere between deciding to write sludge with a few extra wanky bits and prog rock the likes the world has been listening to for decades already, they struck upon that perfect balance. Egos in check, they managed to work together to create a musical soundtrack that does justice to one of the most epic novels ever written, the mighty Moby Dick, with this standing as the pinnacle of all their accomplishments.\n\nThe most important thing to begin with is 'what the fuck do they sound like.' Haters will call them bland \u201cmetalcore,\u201d whilst fans \u2013 and indeed this very site \u2013 call them \u201cprogressive sludge.\u201d The truth, I think, lies somewhere in between. Those that know their genre etymology should be aware that \u201csludge\u201d originated primarily as a blend of \u201cdoom metal\u201d and \u201chardcore punk.\u201d \u201cMetalcore\u201d (as we know today) on the other hand, arrived from \u201cgroove metal\u201d and \u201chardcore punk.\u201d If a \u201csludge\u201d band were to try to, I don't know, give their riffs a bit of a groove to them, well hey now, is this \u201cmetalcore\u201d or \u201csludge\u201d I'm hearing? Say hello to the sound of Mastodon. Does it sound similar to 'Lamb of God?' Why yes it does. Already I can feel rabid fans heavy breathing down the back of my neck, so let me make this abundantly clear: this song is awesome, Lamb of God (hereafter abbreviated to LoG) most certainly are not. Similar does not mean 'as bad as,' and in this case it would be a grave misinterpretation to make.\n\nLets begin with the vocals; both have a gruff rasp and both utilise a damn near identical vocal register. The difference is, where LoG sound like a teenager beating his chest and swearing too much, Mastodon manage to channel the energy of the man blinded in his ambition to capture this beast, roaring his lines through the thunderous guitars with a fervent belief in his abilities. Score one for Mastodon. The drums, too, bear quite the resemblance; a basic bombastic beat laden with fills. The difference is LoG once again come across as that teenager, attention starved and crying 'Mummy! Mummy! Look what can I do!' Mastodon don't give a shit; he's too caught up in their endeavour, wailing on his war drums with a fluidity that would make them sound odd if he wasn't throwing out fills left right and centre.\n\nThis brings me to my third and final point of comparison: the melody. Yes, both have an element of groove to their riffs and rhythms, and yes both intend to be as epic and catchy as they possibly can, but why on earth is this a bad thing? Surely the opposite \u2013 being instantly forgettable \u2013 is rather insulting; if five seconds after the track has ended you can't remember the first thing about it. A song should be somewhat catchy and memorable, and this is possibly one of the catchiest songs I know. The moment those two opening chords come crashing down, you know exactly what's coming next, and you can't help but smirk and wonder if maybe, just this one time, you'll be able to resist the urge to start roaring 'Blood and Thunder' along side, causing everyone on your commute to look at you like you're a psychopath and slowly back away. By comparison, the only track I can recall from LoG is something vaguely about laying down to rest; hardly a topic that gets the blood pumping. So yes, Mastodon and LoG do sound rather similar, but in a single effort Mastodon have done what LoG have been failing miserably to come close to accomplishing in their entire career; are still trying to accomplish in fact. Mastodon in the mean time have moved on. They nailed it years ago, and since then they've done nothing but think, 'how shall we try to be awesome next?'\n\nWritten by Thomas Bawden (Axis of Metal / LiferTheReviewRoom)\n",
        "\nOriginally published at http://suite101.com\n\nMastodon has gone through a career evolution that seems to parallel that of Metallica or Queensryche to some extent. Starting out as a sludge metal band vaguely inspired by progressive rock, they have gradually embraced the prog side of things more with time and became slightly more accessible to the masses in the process. But following the release of the massive prog opus known as Crack The Skye, Mastodon has returned to a more basic template and seems to have created their Black Album of sorts. Fortunately the change manages to stay natural and never has the contrived feel that typically comes with such an overhaul.\n\nSome listeners have been quick to compare this album to past efforts such as Remission and Leviathan, but the reality here is that it isn\u2019t too far off from the various tropes that were developed on Crack the Skye. In fact, it seems to go through just about every sort of sound that the band has ever played with and is stripped down in a much different sense than before.\n\nOn one hand, the album is very reliant on melody. This can be seen as the album includes several ballads such as the title track and \u201cThe Sparrow\u201d that are driven by spacy textures hinted at by past tracks such as \u201cThe Czar.\u201d There is also a greater emphasis on vocal performance as songs such as the stoner rock-ish \u201cCurl of the Burl\u201d and \u201cCreature Lives\u201d are made particularly memorable by their sing-a-long leads and atmospheric chants. On the other hand, there is still a good deal of heaviness to be found as the guitars and drums get plenty of chances to shine. There are also a few moments where the vocals get a little harsher such as the screamed chorus on the two and a half minute long \u201cBlasteroid\u201d and the token Scott Kelly showoff on \u201cSpectrelight.\u201d\n\nBut like every album before this one, the band manages to sound great through it all and works each element into their sound without having them all feel out of place when stacked against one another. The guitars have that signature watery tone and tidal wave feel while the drums provide plenty of great fills. Unfortunately, the bass still feels rather minimal\u2026\n\nAnd whether they are aping Peter Gabriel or bringing about a raspier tone, the vocals work pretty well as each member utilizes their voice to great effect. As someone who used to be rather annoyed by the group\u2019s lack of unified vocals, it was great to see them come together so nicely on Crack The Skye and it is quite satisfying to see them keep the momentum up on here.\n\nBut like every other successful change of direction, the songwriting is what really makes this album work. The group used to go along with the style before substance stereotype that persists in progressive rock, but this release and the previous one show the band making memorable songs while letting all of their quirks still be prominent. With that said, it can be hard to tell just what makes this album more accessible than before. There is the obvious answer of the songs having two-six minute long durations, but it feels like the previous album had more elaborate hooks than this one does. Many of this album\u2019s choruses are quite simple in their composition and execution and could be construed as being rather bone-headed by some... \n\nIf anything, you could say this album is similar to Nevermore\u2019s most recent effort in that it uses the shorter song lengths to make things feel more direct and less like the band is beating around the bush with overly extended segments. There are some songs such as \u201cCreature Lives\u201d that could\u2019ve been made even better with an extra section tacked on but each song generally has all the right elements fall into the right places. And with everything working so well, it is a little hard to get specific tracks firmly established as album highlights. The opening \u201cBlack Tongue\u201d is probably the strongest track of the lot thanks to its heavy but still infectious main riff though \u201cCurl of the Burl\u201d was a wise single choice due to its laid back feel and smooth vocal harmonies.\n\nBut one of the album\u2019s bigger points of hype is the lyrical theme or lack thereof as this is the first Mastodon album since Remission to not feature a unified concept. Some fans may question this move but it isn\u2019t one of particular concern as the band has always been more about their musical performance. And with there being such titles as \u201cOctopus Has No Friends\u201d and \u201cBedazzled Fingernails,\u201d it\u2019s safe to say that the band\u2019s surreal themes are still kept intact\u2026\n\nSeeing as how Mastodon is one of those bands that appear to undergo drastic change with each release they put out, it is rather unfair to compare each album that they\u2019ve put out with the ones before it. But at this point and in this reviewer\u2019s opinion, the odds of the band ever topping Crack the Skye are doubtful at best. But that is not to say that The Hunter was made in an effort in top it in the first place. It may have several tropes that were conceived on that effort, but this release goes about using them in a much different way. If Crack the Skye didn\u2019t convert you to the ways of Mastodon, then this one just might be the one to do the trick. It isn\u2019t a masterpiece or the band\u2019s sellout point, but when all is said and done, it\u2019s a collection of some pretty damn good songs.\n",
        "\nHoly mackerel, Mastodon! You're trampling my mind like an enraged Cysquatch after blunt knife castration! That's one of the most energetic albums to ever emerge from sludge, or even whole modern metal scene. I got into Mastodon's music not so long ago and I must admit that there are both things I love and dislike about their music. However, Blood Mountain is definitely an album that contains mostly the things I like, oh yes. In my opinion, it's the second best Mastodon's release after Crack the Skye.\n\nProduction of the record is good but honestly, could have been better. While drums, especially bass drum, sound heavy and organic, there's something in the way they're produced, that irritates my ears. I guess the snare drum is to be blamed for that as it sounds a bit flat. Also, guitars does not sound as heavy and massive as they should. Anyway, the album sounds clean and isn't painfully overproduced. Still, I think both Leviathan and Crack the Skye have better production.\n\nAs many reviewers have already stated, the record can be considered as a transitional episode between sludgy and aggressive Leviathan and spacey/progressive Crack the Skye. Stomping sludge element is still most prominent one, but experiments with song structures and spacey/psychedelic and progressive rock influences have become more noticeable. Most tracks are galloping sludge metal songs with Mastodon's typical leanings towards punk-ish aggressiveness combined with stoner metal feel (especially in the case of Brent Hinds' vocal delivery). Numerous tempo changes, complex structures and incredibly compelling, unmistakable drumming by Brann Dailor determines Blood Mountain status as a modern progressive metal album. I think the biggest drawback this record has, is the lack of real, compelling masterpieces. Tracks are short and a little bit too uniform for my tastes. Mastodon's great talent for long and complex compositions manifested in their following release, but here - despite a few absolutely fantastic and catchy songs - it's still underdeveloped. Besides, I found some tracks to be simply uninspired or even terribly annoying (\"Bladecatcher\"- what the hell is that? electro-grind-core-stoner metal?). \n\nAll in all, Blood Mountain is a very good eclectic progressive metal album, deeply rooted in sludge metal genre. If you're into aggressive and energetic metal with a stoner element, this record is for you.\n\nTRACKS BY RATINGS: 9/10[fantastic!]: Crystal Skull 8/10[great]: The Wolf Is Loose; Sleeping Giant; Capillarian Crest; Colony of Birchmen; Siberian Divide 7/10[very good]: Circle of Cysquatch; Hunters of the Sky; This Mortal Soil 6/10[good]: Hand of Stone; Pendulous Skin 3/10[poor]: Bladecatcher\n\n-- Originally written for Metal Music Archives [www.metalmusicarchives.com] --\n",
        "\nAfter listening through this album, it's difficult to imagine that the same group made an album like Blood Mountain. There is a noticeable lack of heavy moments on the album, and the once interesting qualities Mastodon possessed are either not shown as much or taken completely out. This album doesn't sound very much like metal. Instead, it takes on a grungy rock type of sound. While I'm not against bands attempting to change their sound from album to album in the name of progressing their sound or exploring new musical frontiers, this album does a very poor job of doing either. \n\nOne might argue that this album does show Mastodon progressing their sound, but I don't find that to be the case here. If anything, this album shows Mastodon digressing in quality. The only tracks on here which show any real heaviness are \"Blasteroid\" and \"Spectrelight.\" While heaviness certainly isn't the main point Mastodon is trying to make with their music, it's certainly a quality that made them fun to listen to. Not only does Mastodon remove one of the reasons that made them an enjoyable listen, but they don't even bring interesting material forth. The album is mainly made up of slow, ambient rock songs which don't provide a very fulfilling listen. Sure, some good guitar riffs occasionally make themselves known, but that doesn't happen much. \n\nThe other argument some might use in defense of this album is that Mastodon is exploring new musical frontiers. I can't say that argument isn't true since Mastodon's sound has changed considerably. However, what I can say is that the explorations they have made with this album aren't very fascinating. The album feels tired, and it shows. \n\nThe positive things about this album are that the vocal performances are solid, there are some good guitar solos to be heard here, and there are moments on this album that do remind the listener of the sound Mastodon once had. Sadly, despite these positive elements, the bad far outweighs the good. The songs are either too slow for their own good, mediocre, or just plain annoying. The track \"Curl of the Burl\" annoyed me very much. The song has a very pop-like tune to it and rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nAs a fan of Mastodon's previous work, this album was very disappointing. I don't recommend checking this album out unless you fit one or both of the following criteria:\n\n1. You enjoy softer, slower music\n\n2. You are a die-hard fan of Mastodon\n",
        "\nYes, ladies and gentlemen, \"Crack the Skye\" is plainly a masterpiece. It's both progressive AND heavy at the same time, making EVERY self-proclaimed \"prog\" Dream Theater-worshipping band, as well as Dream Theater themselves sound unnecessary, pointless and pretentious.\n\nWhat Mastodon has managed to do is what no one else but Metallica had previously done in the metal world: create an album that can be intellectual without going soft, like all \"prog\" metal bands, and still sound metal-as-fuck without being extreme. Practically, the only well-known band that has achieved something remotely similar is Neurosis, but Neurosis has a lot of hardcore influences and thus does not count. And, yes, I know Mastodon is influenced by Neurosis, but fuck you, of course they are, Neurosis is a band that has huge artistic potential, as they have displayed multiple times. And the Mastodon guys definitely don't rip off anything, since whereas Neurosis is more oriental and atmospheric, Mastodon frequently go for \"happier\" parts, such as in \"Divinations\".\n\nSo, what comprises the sound? Four guys that simply love what they do. The riffs vary from mountain-heavy or melodic mid paced parts, to arpeggios, to fast progressive riffs that might resemble Yes or Rush, to licks that fill your soul with thousands of different emotions, to peculiar dissonant chords... Brent Hinds and Bill Keliher deliver a playing that retains the listener's interest with its plethora of styles, without any parts that don't fit well with each other. This is especially evident on closing track \"The Last Baron\", which is according to the band \"a collection of riffs\", and depicts a continuity which is rare for compositions of this kind. And there's also the solos, that -thank Satan- have no shredding parts at all. The bass parts have a key role, as they often play the main melody while the guitars enrich the songs with more elaborate musical phrashing. Except for those occasions, there are bone-crusher parts that you can feel in your stomach if you listen to the album via speakers of high fidelity. And there are also parts when the bass just follows the guitars, or vice-versa, I couldn't know... Finally, I find the drumming to be extremely appealing as there are tons of creative fillers and tom-tom parts that give a sense of direction to the songs. Personally, Brann Dailor is one of my three favourite modern drummers, alongside Gavin Harisson of Porcupine Tree and Jamie Saint Merat of Ulcerate. His fillers also resemble Bill Ward, due to their overall creativity and the fact that there is not a pair of identical fillers through the whole album. The production is crystal clear yet not sterile, and as a consequence all the instruments are perfectly audible.\n\nI would elaborate on the concept of the album but I don't want to since there are plenty different interpretations and it would take hours. Of course, the fact that it's up to everyone to interprete it however they mean to makes the existence of the concept interesting.\n\nAll in all, \"Crack the Skye\" is a virtually flawless opus from a band that always pushed boundaries. You should definitely listen to it if you like anything from King Crimson to Kylesa... damn, even if you don't, Mastodon's magnificent fourth album might blow you away!\n",
        "\nIf I wanted to be a dick, I could have simply given The Hunter a pass-fail grade on each song, based it on lasting enjoyability, calculated the mean, and given Mastodon somewhere around a 38% on what is its fifth and arguably most disappointing full-length to date. Although I stand by the above claim, both Mastodon and The Hunter deserve to be given more credit post-Crack The Skye taking us all by storm in 2009. It's always a bit easier to pinpoint a specific \"transition\" album in any band's discography after that band has released a number of albums. In retrospect, songs that may have once seemed like blemishes turn out to be the origins of brilliant and innovative ideas for future recordings. More likely than not, we are observing a case of that here. Skeptics were quick to assume that The Hunter may have only consisted of quickly thrown-together Crack The Skye b-sides dedicated to getting Mastodon more radio plays and commercial popularity. (I include myself in this category of misanthropes.) After listening more intently, I can almost guarantee that this is not the case; but this indestructible four-piece is certainly going to have to spend some time back at the ol' drawing board if they want this album to become as acceptable as Blood Mountain did as soon as Crack The Skye was released.\n\nRemission and Crack The Skye serve as two massively solid bookends for the first decade of the band's career. Both of those albums represent the greatest works of a band that helped shape a giant portion of the last ten years in metal. The two albums also play off each other quite nicely: Where one is punishingly heavy, the other is a psychedelic warp zone exploring the deeper side of modern heavy metal. Where Remission's short, powerful songs are far from sounding boringly simplistic, the epics on Crack The Skye come off as anything but pretentious or self-indulgent. The reason why it's important to bring up Mastodon's first and last efforts of the previous decade (other than for convincing you that they are easily the band's two finest albums) is because The Hunter seems to be almost an exact combination of the two. Those familiar with all of the band's works will immediately know why that sounds so bizarre. Truth be told, The Hunter is a complete chore to listen to front to back, and not in the same way most would expect. This mother is so full of hooks, it wouldn't run out of them even if it were a pocketless, one-man fishing operation sailing from Portugal to South America on an inflatable rubber dinghy. The main problem isn't that Hinds' clean vocals ring constantly throughout the entire album, but that the majority of the actual choruses are too simplistic, too repetitive, and very fucking annoying... even to the extent that Clear Channel producers had hard-ons before they even heard the damn thing.\n\nThe reason why shorter tracks worked so well on Remission and Leviathan was because they were both super heavy and groovy as hell. \"Curl of the Burl,\" \"Blasteroid,\" \"Octopus Has No Friends,\" \"All The Heavy Lifting,\" and \"Thickening\" are neither, and will get old very fast. And those aren't the only songs on the album that suck. \"The Hunter\" would get eaten alive by \"The Czar\" any day of the week (as it feels like a failed attempt to recreate such a magnificent song), and \"Creature Lives\" contains over a minute of laughter, followed by vocals that seem like a mix between pop punk and white men singing in a church choir. The point is: If Mastodon is trying to condense the unforgettable trips that are \"The Czar\" and \"The Last Baron\" down into four minutes, the band is going to need more than a miracle. Crack The Skye was a true journey into what might be the absolute pinnacle of modern stoner rock. It contained a mere seven songs, yet was almost a full hour in length. The Hunter is only a few minutes longer and contains thirteen tracks, seven of which have already received failing grades. In theory, there isn't anything wrong with music that is easily accessible... that is until it gets caught in your head and you wake up in the middle of the night wanting to erase the memory of \"Curl of the Burl\" from your brain entirely. (We call this \"Ohrwurm\" in German.) Disagree? Tell me if you're still listening to the same shitty songs a year from now and I'll reconsider my statements. Thankfully, there are some pretty kickass songs on this record as well, so let's get to those... I promise it's positivity and optimism from here on out.\n\nAlthough \"Black Tongue\" is an exciting start for the album, it's songs like \"Stargasm\" that really leave much to be discovered after the initial couple of listens. Thankfully, the refrain doesn't dull immediately the way it does with so many of the album's other songs. The same goes with \"Dry Bone Valley,\" another track which could have replaced \"Oblivion\" or \"Divinations\" on Crack The Skye. The real surprise, however, comes with the The Hunter's closing tracks. Together, the three of them contain every aspect that helped make Mastodon a god among ants in the first place, whether it be the sheer power of \"Spectrelight,\" the unique technicalities and memorable vocals of \"Bedazzled Fingernails,\" or the solemn beauty of \"The Sparrow.\" All are reasons to believe that Mastodon hasn't forgotten its roots and is merely delving into a realm of self-exploration, as opposed to releasing the precursor to the first Load of the 21st century. (Take note that The Hunter may be as important to the coming decade as The Black Album was for the 90s.) Hopeful fans should still be cautious, as Mike Elizondo (Fiona Apple, Maroon 5, 50 Cent[ouch]) is solely credited for the production of this album.\n\nIn the past decade, the members of Mastodon set the standard in many different aspects of metal by pushing their creative boundaries to the fullest. Each of the first four full-lengths is a favorite album to a varying crowd of opinionated die-hards. Given the strength of the albums of the Naughties, The Hunter is nowhere near bad enough to completely derail the band's fan base, but it would probably be best if Mastodon remembers the fans who have supported them for the past 10+ years by not botching the set list of the next tour without prior warning. (I'm looking at you, \u00c5kerfeldt.)\n\nFinally, this album comes equipped with some fantastic visual work including the making of the wooden sculpture featured on the front cover and a music video that goes with each song. Although perks like this, working hand-in-hand with showy musicianship, might be enough to keep the munchkins entertained, music lovers are going to require a bit more quality songwriting to walk away from this album with a long-lasting, positive impression. Music alone should be powerful enough to take any listener for a ride, anything else should be strictly supplemental. \n\nOriginally written for MetalReview.com\n",
        "\nThis is certainly an odd record that Mastodon has put out here, even more so than others they have in the past. The traditional Mastodon sound is still present and they have by no means sold out, but there just seems to be something wrong. The album is still high quality, catchy, brutal, and emotionally evocative, but it is just not on the same caliber as their other works. To some degree the lack of a concept album is probably to blame here.\n\nBut I\u2019m coming off way too negative here. The Hunter is still a delight the entire way through, with interesting eccentricities and head banging moments abounding with a swirl of psychedelic vocals layered on top. Drums are still pretty good, but far less than what I expect of the behemoth man behind the skins that is Brenn Dailor. This album also features an abundance of guitar leads, which may be some of the catchiest that Mastodon has written yet.\n\nThe guitars prove to be the most interesting instrument on the album and from a songwriting perspective most songs are based around riffs with vocals added on top to accentuate; only during the choruses of songs do vocals really take hold. More than any other Mastodon record, the focus of the riffing on this album is the traditional Mastodon sound blended with post-thrash core, progressive, and occasionally alternative metal riffing. The songs also seem to use different distortion and tuning on just about every song, leading to a very diverse listen through the album, with the thrashy Blasteroid to the dreamy Sparrow to the psychedelic intro of Thickening.\n\nIn much the same way that Crack the Skye directly injected melody, guitar leads provide the heart and soul of the cuts. Curl of the Burl has an odd lead riff that seems equally alternative and metal that carries a unique groove while the title track features the showiest solo that helps bring an intensely emotional piece to its climax (more gushing on that later). Bedazzled Fingernails and All the Heavy Lifting continue this trend of bisected metalternative. \n\nThe guitar playing also lends itself to progressive tendencies in a few spots, the most notable being Thickening. That song takes it slow, while soothing you with gentle yet complex melodies. Octopus Has No Friends (except for Brent) takes to the other end of the spectrum with that idea and features a flurry of notes making up the main riff that somehow form a cohesive melody. The guitars are definitely the strong point on the album.\n\nNo bass is audible (except for Creature Lives, which features very little else and was written by Dailor). I\u2019ve tried very hard to find it in any other song, but I can\u2019t. You\u2019re killing me here. At least Troy Sanders gets more airtime in vocals.\n\nThe most important thing that separates The Hunter from any other Mastodon album is that is meant to be fun. Everything else has been a serious concept album with deep lyrics and engaging melodies that told a holistic story, but there is very little of that here. The band has been open about trying to write fun songs to play live, and on a few tracks they achieve that.\n\nThe problem here is that as a whole the album falls apart. The individual songs are good, but looking at the whole instead of the parts has usually played in their favor, but things just seem to get fuzzy. Without an over-arching story the lyrics descend into chaos and become really unintelligent and boring. As a result the songs as a whole start to fail when they cannot properly convey a message or idea, bringing about a lack of emotion. I don\u2019t mean to say that a concept album is a surefire way to a good album, but the band lacks direction without one. The songs themselves are written well enough with licks, verses, and choruses well placed and thought out, but they seem to lack soul when listening to the album straight through instead of individually.\n\nThe only other part of the album that falls short (although this is a much more minor problem) is the drums. By now we have given up on a return to the rampant, chaotic and precisely technical drumming of Dailor, but even so the quality declines from Crack the Skye. There are virtually no fills, which could add a great deal more to upbeat tracks like Black Tongue and Blasteroid. He does mix things up with different percussion on Dry Bone Valley and the quirky Creature Lives, but none if it is that interesting. He will introduce new patterns and it isn\u2019t repetitive, but this part plays the alternative card a bit more than I personally enjoy.\n\nWhile most of the tracks are very catchy, some grab your attention much more than others. The Hunter is a beautiful ballad to Brent Hinds\u2019 lost brother, with mournful and depressive vocals emitted amidst a somber tempo with a solo that is flashy, speedy, technical, and transcendent. Dry Bone Valley is my other favorite from the album, being the most upbeat and rhythmically tailored for neck snapping. The cymbal used during the chorus adds a jovial energy to the song while Troy Sanders knocks it out of the park with foreboding and frightened vocals.\n\nThis leads me to the other particularly strong part of this CD, the vocals. They are often wispy and barely there and almost always clean, adding a good deal to the alternative and progressive influence. Both Hinds and Sanders deliver hook after hook, especially on the title track, Stargasm, and Spectrelight. Other times they take a backseat and provide atmosphere more instrumentally than lyrically on cuts like All the Heavy Lifting and Bedazzled Fingernails. Also, on a side note, pay close attention to Creature Lives, which features a cool techno and sampling intro with the only bass line heard clear. The vocals also add a lot to the song and are the only to feature the drummer with the microphone.\n\nIn the modern music world, this album stands very tall with individual tracks all bringing something different to the table, but when you delve into the album as a whole it is significantly lacking and underwhelming for Mastodon\u2019s poignant and engrossing lyrics. Still worth a listen, but without the seriousness of a concept like on Crack the Skye the band loses focus and become too focused on fun tracks. Which that being said are fun, but they (and the album as a whole) do not yield as much audio goodness in the long run. Crappy bonus DVD doesn\u2019t help their cause either. Still worth a casual listen. Best tracks: Stargasm, The Hunter, Dry Bone Valley, and Spectrelight.\n",
        "\nMastodon have a tight and technical style of metal that can be very thrashy at times. The band's interest in nature that's red in tooth and claw combined with science-fiction fantasy and a tendence to soar on long flights of guitar-melody indulgence puts the guys firmly in the prog rock category. No wonder Mastodon has sometimes been described as Metallica-meets-Rush! Technically the music is good and the skills involved are astounding but the songs are not distinctive and the whole album sounds like 12 movements of one major opus.\n\nFor a band that's been on the cusp of breaking into mainstream stadium metal for a long time, \"Blood Mountain\" has few songs that can be called catchy and which have melodies and riffs that audiences can latch onto and claim as their own. Nearly every song is jam-packed with virtuoso string-pulling, breakneck-speed drumming and a complex choreography of riffs and melodies that must require a special Google program for the fingers to navigate. Stunning lyrical imagery in many songs is let down by fairly ordinary singing. When all is said and done, I feel blown away by the members' technical chops and the music's dense nature but I'm disappointed that not much room was left on the album for emotion and a feeling of soaring and flying high and fast with the guys and their prehistoric prey on tracks like \"Hunters of the Sky\" and \"Siberian Divide\". A sense that we're riding with godly power and creatures born of fire, metal and refined clay is lacking.\n\nOne day it will dawn on Mastodon that they don't need to bust their guts trying to out-play and out-do everybody else and they should just let the music breathe and take them where it will. With an injection of easy, natural flow, some mood, atmosphere and a sense of wonder, awe and majesty, the music will achieve the greatness the band has been gunning for.\n\nAn original version of this review appears in The Sound Projector (Issue 19, 2011).\n",
        "\nMastodon has been compared to Metallica over and over again. In terms of career paths and trajectory, the similarities are many. Both had the raw debut album embraced by the underground. Their sophomore efforts were polished, gaining the attention of critics outside metal. Third and fourth releases pushed the envelope even further toward thematically-heavy, highly complex material. Metallica's fifth album signaled a dramatic change of direction toward a more accessible mainstream sound and Mastodon have stated they wanted material that was more \"fun\". Is The Hunter the first step toward selling out?\n\nFor now, I'm going to withhold judgment on that score. But I will say this: Mastodon have put together the catchiest metal record of the year. It seems the Georgians have been listening to some Torche since their last full-length (check out \"Blasteroid\") and put some serious pop sensibility into the songwriting. The sound is Leviathan/Blood Mountain era (leaning toward the former), so it's interesting to see that decidedly pop songs can be so complex. It's also interesting that even when the stated intent is to get away from complex, difficult-to-play music, it's still firmly progressive.\n\nThis is Mastodon at their most accessible, but it's still not \"fun\" in the way you might think of Van Halen or, for that matter, Katy Perry. It's still pretty dark (see the title track) and heavy (see \"Spectrelight\"). \"Curl of the Burl\", which is perhaps my favorite song of the year, illustrates the point perfectly. To deal with subjects such as murder and an unfair/uncaring universe, they use the provincial, whimsical title phrase.\n\n\"Curl\" is just the tip of the iceberg. Every song on here is catchy, and they hint a bit more at some of their influences such as Pink Floyd (\"The Sparrow\") and Steve Miller Band (\"Creature Lives\"). \n\nThe Verdict: I don't know where they go from here, and the similarities to Metallica's career arc are starting to scare me. On the other hand, the industry is different now, so I'm not sure there's much motivation for them to \"sell out\". For now, I'm just going to enjoy the hell out of The Hunter. It's an album of the year contender.\n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nExpectations are a funny thing. When a new album comes out, quite often much of one's first experience with it is determined before they even slip the record into the player. Whether it is their favourite band and they have been waiting ages for it, or it is an album that is ridiculed and they have been alerted of how bad it apparently is; all of these factors come together to form our expectation of an album, which- obviously based on the quality of the music itself- will greatly sway our response, even after the album is done. Enter Mastodon, a band I have always generally respected, but did not find much to justify the hype with them, even on their progressive opus 'Crack The Skye'. With that in mind, I may not have had the greatest hopes for the new record, let alone the fact that everything I had heard about this in press releases tended to suggest that this was a simplified and even 'dumbed down' version of the band that had shown a lot of promise with their progressive direction. With that in mind, it may be merely my preconception that it was going to be a mediocre-at-best album, but I have found myself incredibly impressed by the reality of Mastodon's new album; 'The Hunter'. While I can definitely see where some of the descriptors were coming from concerning the new direction Mastodon has taken, the angle from which Mastodon sets off here sets the record straight for me. Not only has my feeling that this was going to be a mediocre album been more or less dispelled, but I would not hesitate in calling this the best album Mastodon have done to date.\n\nBefore the album was released, there was plenty of news that this was a simplified, 'accessible' version of Mastodon, and that they were turning their backs on the prog rock trends that the last two records had been rooted in, and going for a more straightforward rock sound. This label passes me very much the same way that the way similar-sounding The Mars Volta's album 'Octahedron' was described as their 'acoustic' record. It is certainly not a literal description, and there is much more going on here than what the artists might lead on. Without a doubt, 'The Hunter' is the most eclectic Mastodon album to date; with songs here ranging from vivid psychedelia, to spacey metal, sombre prog rock and a handful of stoner rock. The only thing on 'The Hunter' that has truly lived up to my expectation are the song lengths, which are kept within a comfortable limit. There are no more bombastic epics here like here were on 'Crack The Skye', but the album manages to stay consistently exciting and interesting, thanks in large part to the diversity of the tracks.\n\nEven from the first listen, each of these songs has a different identity from one another; some songs may follow similar paths, but each has a set of ideas that are entirely their own. Mastodon seems to have made an effort here also not to put any like-sounding songs on one after the other. Take the differences between the second track 'Curl Of The Burl', and its successor 'Blasteroid'. The former is a bluesy piece of mid-tempo riff rock that relies on catchy melodies and straightforward structure, whereas 'Blasteroid' takes the listener on a trippy and exciting journey with all the psychedelic twitters entailed. 'Stargasm' continues this string of awesome song names with a much more melancholic sound, a very spacey piece that could have been plucked straight from 'Crack The Skye'. As far as an overlying change of style and pace goes, I would say that Mastodon have more of a psychedelic influence in their sound than ever, although the metal sound has been largely preserved. I find the psychedelic, and more atmosphere-fueled sections of 'The Hunter' to be among the most interesting, although the heavier parts here are a little more hit and miss.\n\nMastodon's sludgy riff work and distinctive tone are both here, but it works at its best when they are able to find the fine balance between hooks and heaviness. 'Curl Of The Burl' is an example of a song that tends to stray a little too far into hook territory, and probably best exemplifies why I feared 'The Hunter' would sound like. It may be memorable as a track, but there is no depth to it; and even before the first listen is done, I had the impression that there was now a big void in Mastodon's sound. The only two songs that really realize this 'accessible' rock sound are 'Curl', and 'Dry Bone Valley'. Neither gave me much of a rush, and they do feel like what's keeping me from calling 'The Hunter' a masterpiece, because some of the other material on the album makes me want to make that leap. Mastodon have virtually perfected their spacey sound here, best represented by the album's highlight 'Stargasm', and 'The Sparrow', a sombre track that closes the album in classic prog rock tradition; a trippy hymn that builds and lets the listener off on a perfect note. It is a perfect track for this album, because it gives me great motivation to experience the album all over again. I understand full well that many who are first listening to this album are already Mastodon fans, so taking for the fact that I- someone who never cared for them much in the past- am truly digging this album is a great sign for 'The Hunter'. It is not a full step above 'Crack The Skye' in every way, but as the overall musical experience goes, it looks like Mastodon has a new record to outdo with anything they may release in the future.\n",
        "\nOne of the most anticipated metal albums of 2011 has been Mastodon's 'The Hunter'. In 2009, they took their music to a new level with 'Crack The Skye', which has since been considered a modern progressive metal classic. After going all-out with a bombastic concept and thirteen minute epics, Mastodon then decide to tone down their sound in favour of a more accessible style, as would be promised in their new album. As someone who appreciated the adventurous risks they were taking with their progressive material, I was a little disappointed to hear that they were regressing, but would check out the album all the same to some considerable relief. While I was thinking that Mastodon had thrown down their progressive arms and turned 'pop', I beheld the greatest album they had done to date, although it certainly was not perfect. There were still songs here that fulfilled my apprehension of Mastodon 'dumbing down' their sound, and sadly, the big single from this album is an offender. 'Curl Of The Burl' sees Mastodon go for a bland, generic take on stoner rock. Luckily, this would be more of an exception in the album, than a general rule.\n\nIf Mastodon had not already announced that they were aiming to create a more rock-based record, I would have thought that the band was making a joke with 'Curl Of The Burl', a bluesy riff-oriented track that is about as straightforward as it gets. Keep in mind that this is still Mastodon, and from the tones of the guitar to the distinctive voices, Mastodon never try to be someone that they aren't. What they are being is a stripped down, naked version of themselves, without any nuance or depth to it. This does make for a pretty instantly enjoyable listen, and especially with the sing-song chorus, 'Curl Of The Burl' is a track that gets in your head by the end of the first listen. A good song does not get worse with every subsequent listen though, and this is something that this song suffers badly from. For a concise dish of tame riff rock, Mastodon's 'Curl Of The Burl' is a good choice, but there really isn't enough here to be worth returning to on its own.\n",
        "\nI can dig Mastodon's rationale for making an album like this; a bit tired of heavy themes, just wanting to have a good time, can't be arsed explaining to confused musical journalists the increasingly labryinthe concepts of their albums. The other alternative is that they just sold the fuck out, although I've always been of the opinion that if a band wants to do a catchy, rocky album then it's all good. Perhaps this is best described as a transition album, though; there's a lot about this that is rather awkward- it's not quite the good times bro-metal album that Mastodon were going for.\n\nThe huge amount of filler aside I think half the problem is that Mastodon are still a bit too, well, Mastodon-y. You want to be catchy and direct that's fine, that's beautiful. But it's hard to do it when the song structures are still all over the place and definitely not when a lot of the riffs are quite simply lacking in that direct punch that's required to pull this off. So many profoundly average songs here- from the title track to Bedazzled Fingernails it's a pretty horrible six song slog, from the profoundly uncatchy (Dry Bone Valley) to pretty awful pisstakes (Creature Lives). It doesn't help that the vocals, while generally competent, are rarely anything more than that, generally being these bright, poppy, vaguely Ozzy-esque vocals that while not annoying certainly aren't commanding attention with their all-too-inoffensive presence.\n\nFair call to Mastodon though, when they nail this sound they fucken nail it and it's a serious pleasure to listen to. The first half is all solid but clearly there's a few songs where stuff just clicks. \"Curl of the Burl\" is some seriously infectious, seriously groovy shit with a mean chorus riff and a short but excellent bridge- I wonder how much influence the producer had on shaping that song? Far catchier and more direct than anything Mastodon have ever done. Meanwhile, \"Octopus has no friends\" is a really good mix of the usual adventurous Mastodon guitar playing with the catchiest vocal lines of the album. These tracks combined with the titanic, surprisingly heartfelt Floyd + arena ballad ender \"The Sparrow\", (featuring a guitar solo with a tone I can only describe as \"bitching\") definitely suggest that with a bit more effort- and a similarly deft choice of producer- Mastodon could do something that would be black album-esque in it's mix of catchiness and heaviness.\n\n...But they aren't there yet. Yeah, there's a few songs here that are fantastic, but you've gotta judge an album as a whole, right? And for every good song here there's some painfully uncatchy, forgettable filler- thus, the square 50% Regardless, I'm very much looking forward to the next Mastodon album; great things could well be forthcoming.\n",
        "\nMastodon are one of those bands that have achieved such a high level of visibility and success that they can do no wrong in the eyes of some, and do no right for the ears of others. To their enormous, rabid installed fan base, they are considered geniuses, the 'salvation of extreme music'. And frankly, were they to release an album of syncopated projectile vomiting, these folks might still revel in it. On the other hand, to their detractors, they're the prime suspect in the whole 'hipster' crowd, i.e. metal for people who don't like metal. Some of this is the typical rebellion against all things popular which has always been a staple of the underground, and some is just the xenophobic whining of emos in hesher clothing who seem terribly convinced of their own purity when they can be bothered to stop sniffing their own bodily fumes. Others really just don't like the music Mastodon writes. Hey, it happens.\n\nPersonally, I have enjoyed the band to this point. In particular their 2006 opus Blood Mountain, an album I found brilliant to the degree that it remains in regular rotation in my car stereo five years later. A hybrid of groove and progressive metal, hardcore and the unique leanings of acts like Voivod, F.U.C.T., D.B.C., Today is the Day wrapped up in the flesh of rustic folklore and prehistoric fascination? Sign me up. Their earlier, progressive sludge stuff like Leviathan and Remission was perhaps not so revelatory, but nonetheless good. As for Crack the Skye, I had a more mixed reaction. The album felt as if the band were attempting to capture a fragment of Blood Mountain's more progressive rock leanings and then extend it out into a full conceptual piece which was far less exhilarating, and I've only rarely summoned up the urge to experience it further.\n\nTwo years later, they've come back with The Hunter, their most user friendly and commercially accessible jaunt to date. Many have drawn a parallel between this and Metallica's 'dumbing down' on The Black Album, which is an apt comparison, if not entirely accurate. Things have changed, in that the band are writing obvious, layered melodic chorus vocals, and occasionally simpler guitar rhythms. Yet others haven't. One trait here that really ties this record into the past few is Brann Dailor's excellent drumming, which remains nearly as busy as Crack the Skye, if never so much that it outpaces or outdistances the musical plot. In general, the musicianship is still cracking throughout, the varied tempos functional in keeping the ears glued through both the sparse bouts of manic intensity and the glistening vocal candy. And this is one area, perhaps, in which The Hunter deviates from past patterns.\n\nWhile something like Blood Mountain was as a general rule heavy, with only a few moments of bliss (\"Pendulous Skin\", or the wondrous climb of melodies in \"Sleeping Giant\"), this is a much more 'even' balance of the two poles. You've got dreamy, mesmeric pieces here like finale \"The Sparrow\" over which the vocals sooth and soar like a lost Pink Floyd ballad, or \"Creature Lives\", my least favorite track here which uses a lot of the open air choral vocals you might hear in Fleet Foxes, The Arcade Fire or the moodier Beach Boys tunes. This experimentation isn't by default bad, I just found the guitars and the overall structure of the song pretty bland, predictable and empty. Then there's the song which is basically a straight up stoner rock piece, \"Curl of the Burl\", redolent of Corrosion of Conformity or Monster Magnet but with a lame chorus: 'It's just the curl of the burl/that's just the way of the world/it's just the curl of the burl'. Really? Or how about the unfortunate \"Blasteroid\", which sounds like a Southern inflected Foo Fighters until it grows some balls for the spastic dissonant snarling metalcore of the bridge.\n\nBut all is far from lost, and there are a handful of tracks here which I'd consider genuinely appealing. Opener \"Black Tongue\" has some solid, escalating riffs and somewhat of a black, space rock atmosphere to it, and reminds me quite a lot of Blood Mountain. \"Spectrelight\" stands out to me for how the angst-ridden vocals slice straight through the thick, muddy grooves of the guitar. And \"Bedazzled Fingernails\" is a compelling pastiche of clean, jangling and swerving guitars with more of the psychedelic, layered vocals that stand to memory long after the song fades. I would be remiss to not also mention \"Octopus Has No Friends\" or \"All the Heavy Lifting\", which are both fairly interesting forays that bridge together the heavy, melodic rock influence with a lot of adventurous guitars courtesy of Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher.\n\nA band like Mastodon can afford to make their album sound crystalline and huge in accordance with pop and mainstream rock standards, and so it's only natural that The Hunter is prim and proper enough to allow all its instruments to breathe. There is no question that the quartet has put an enormous amount of effort into the arrangements, in particular the vocals, which all the band members contribute towards. They're still technically inclined and 'progressive' without ever coming off showy or overly indulgent, but regardless this is a safer album geared partially towards a wider rock audience, and thus some of the tracks are vapid and unmemorable to the point that they feel as if they soil the rest. 5-6 of these would have made for one hell of an EP, but I could do without the padding, and I found the lyrics here far less poignant and stunning in their imagery, loaded with cliches and nonsense that I simply don't expect from this band.\n\nIn the end, while I 'like' The Hunter, and it's not nearly the disaster it might have been or that some might claim, it does not hold up to their earlier full-lengths. Never before have I felt the urge to actually skip songs on a Mastodon release (I don't visit Crack the Skye often, but when I do, I plunge straight through it), but it's all too easy to cut something like \"Creature Lives\", \"Stargasm\" or \"Dry Bone Valley\" out of the play list altogether. At the very least, I hope they've shaken some of the chinks out of their armor with this album and will turn the ignition key for the future. And write some fucking LYRICS next time.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nMastodon have been, currently are, and (most likely) always will be a bit of an enigma to me. They truly are a band that write their own rules and then follow them as much as possible, yet still deviate in some cases. The band manages to be very mainstream and accesible while maintaining a loyal underground fanbase. Few bands have reached a level of stardom through merely playing the exact kind of music they want to play without \u201cselling out\u201d. For this reason I would like to refer to their take on heavy metal as \u201cMastodon Metal\u201d because \u201cprog\u201d doesn\u2019t quite describe it (and Mastodon metal is way cooler sounding). You see, Mastodon metal doesn\u2019t really play by rules. When you are in Mastodon and you make Mastodon metal, you have zero limitations, and as long as you get the approval of the rest of Mastodon, then, whatever your contribution to the sound is, becomes Mastodon metal- thus, why none of their albums sound the same.\n\nMany people may disagree with that statement, saying that it\u2019s obvious that Mastodon have \u201csold out\u201d, which is apparent through their increase in non screamed vocals and trading of heavy sludge riffs for melodies over the years and albums. There are two reasons why I say \u201cbalderdash\u201d to this claim of swapping art for money. The first is that Brent Hinds has a face tattoo, which I believe, that if there is a handbook on how to not \u201csell out\u201d, then face tattoos would be in the first chapter. The second reason is the the same reason why some might say that Mastodon has sold out- The Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe Hunter\u201d is one of the most interesting albums I have come across yet this year. There is a lot of challenging content to be had with this record, almost all of which is very rewarding once you have digested it and then revisited. Definitely not an album to judge off of the first, second or even third listen, it is a very complex album that requires effort to fully appreciate, but once you get below the surface and the music becomes a familiar territory, things will begin to make sense in a crazy Mastodon metal sort of way.\n\nSpiralling towers of color, wide open psychadelic fields of mania and abnormality, fluid melodies reciting bizarre myths\u2013 these are all things that take place as \u201cThe Hunter\u201d washes over you. Some of these tracks are so weird that I am not really sure I have heard anything like them, especially in metal, which is the strongest aspect of the album. The tracks that really explore the abilities of the band members and draw out pure hardened gems of focused creativity from them are where this album shines and the reason why this review ends in as high of a score as it does. The tracks that do not indulge in this quite as much are the albums only folly.\n\nI will get the bad stuff out of the way so I can gush a bit about the traits I like. The main problems actually start at the beginning of the album and taper off slowly with each track. There isn\u2019t really a bad song on this album but there are a few skippable ones when compared to the standout cuts. \u201cBlack Tongue\u201d and \u201cCurl of the Burl\u201d are both Mastodon on autopilot, the latter being far more guilty of this than the former. With as talented as these guys are, I am pretty sure they could write these songs in their sleep. Is it pure coincidence that these are both singles and radio friendly songs? Since I was not there when Mastodon wrote and recorded them, I cannot say, but I would guess they are a direct result of label pressure. These are still decent songs, mind you, they just pale in comparison to the epic ballads and anthems that come later. Worry not because with each passing track, things get a little better.\n\nWhich brings me to the far superior songs. After the rockabilly inspired \u201cBlasteroids\u201d finishes, \u201cStargasm\u201d begins, which was the first track that made me sit up and pay attention. Full of ambience and spacey melodies, yet far from a \u201cslow song\u201d, this is a very cool tune with a very subtle but effective riff that makes the song. The next few songs are all solid and if I am going to wrap this review up anytime soon, I will unfortunately have to skip over them. \u201cDry Bone Valley\u201d is the first song in the true \u201cmeat\u201d of the album in my opinion. Brann Dailor, one of the best drummers in modern metal, takes the lead vocals on this song and shows that he is truly multitalented. After \u201cThickening\u201d (another favorite of mine), what I believe is the best song on the whole album plays\u2013 \u201cCreature Lives\u201d if I am not mistaken was completely written by Dailor and he provides almost exclusive vocals for it. This song made me do a triple take, and at first I could not decide whether I actually liked it or not, but after many many replays I believe this could be Mastodons best song.\n\nYour first listen of \u201cThe Hunter\u201d may have you saying, \u201cwhat the fuck is this?\u201d, or you may be somewhat underwhelmed and say, \u201cthis can\u2019t be it\u201d, so my advice is as follows: through whatever means necessary, acquire this album even if it\u2019s not a perfect 10, then, listen to it many times, take breaks if you have to, but make sure you come back. You will be missing out on some very inventive and unique metal if you disregard Mastodon\u2019s latest offering at first listen.\n\nOriginally written for: http://leatherandtrash.wordpress.com/album-reviews/mastodon-the-hunter-2011/\n",
        "\nWell here it is, the new Mastodon album, the much-anticipated follow up to 200whatever\u2019s Crack the Skye. What was expected to be an air themed album, the conclusion of their elemental quintology, is, as confirmed by Brent Hinds, actually flying write in the face of that concept. Thematics aside, does the quality of the album alone stand up? No, it sucks dick!\n\nThe opener, Black Tongue, actually instills one with a certain degree of hope for the rest of the songs. A heavy, memorable opening riff harkens back to Crack the Skye\u2019s Oblivion. The difference is that this song, while competent, doesn\u2019t develop into anything terribly astonishing. Many may be excited at the stripped down compositions, expecting something in similar vein to Remission. Well, you\u2019ll also be disappointed, The Hunter\u2019s song writing is miles away from early Mastodon, more in line with Fuse-friendly mallgoth metal.\n\nA slew of stupidly titled songs follow the opener: Curl of the Burl, Blasteroid, Octopus Has No Friends, Bedazzled Fingernails, and perhaps the most offensively stupid, Stargasm, a delightful ode to sex in space. Musically there\u2019s plenty to be desired. Every competent riff is ruined by the vocals. Someone tell Brent Hinds that he really can\u2019t carry this level of singing. The band imitates everyone from Ozzy Osbourne to Umphrey\u2019s Magee to Coheed and Cambria to Avenged Sevenfold to Tool and god knows what else. Producer Mike Elizondo really shows his chops here. Not that I\u2019d expect much from the co-producer of In Da Club. At the end of the day, Mastodon is just lost without a central theme, and Elizondo\u2019s influence doesn\u2019t really help matters.\n\nHonestly there\u2019s just not really much else to say. This album is just not very good. Missed opportunity coupled with many horrible new directions. Even regular guest Scott Kelley can\u2019t do much to save his feature, Spectrelight. Seriously, Mastodon put out a real crock of shit. Why would they do that?\n",
        "\nMany metalheads and critics consider Leviathan to be Mastodon's magnum opus. I see their point as it is a very creative and inspired album, however there's something more polished and finished here than the raw energy of Leviathan. Rather than feeling as if you are far out in the ocean hundreds of feet below the surface, you feel as if you are following a primitive man on a hunt through a mythical, prehistoric forest.\n\nThe band's songwriting is premium here as every note belongs. From the fast, technical riffs of 'Crystal Skull' and 'Capillarian Crest' to the chaos of 'Bladecatcher' and even to the moments of beauty, 'This Mortal Soil', everything is original and done well. The lyrics are not the highlight of the album, but they fulfill their purpose by supporting the imagery and concept - \"hunter, gatherer/ridden from the cave\". The vocals are nice, although I don't consider them to be excellent by any means.\n\nOne of the things that is showcased on this album from beginning to end are the interweaving guitar harmonies. Now, there are many bands in all types of metal that employ this technique. What many metal bands concentrate on is shredding as fast as humanly possible or playing a handful of palm-muted grooves. What Mastodon does differently is focus on melody while also being innovative instead of using the same formula over and over. \n\nCritics of this album often complain about the band's drummer, Brann Dailor. His style is chaotic and maybe even ridiculous at times, and I understand that, but I think that's what individualizes him, even placing him in the same category as Danny Carey. Dailor is the driving force of the music, his drumming leading the band into more interesting territory, at least on the faster songs. His fills add a new facet to every song while never leaving the other instruments in his wake. Mastodon would be an entirely different band without him.\n\nMastodon's skill at painting pictures with their music is strong here. Even during the first few seconds of the album during 'The Wolf Is Loose', the protagonist is being chased through the trees. This motif is continued through nearly every song. In 'Colony of Birchmen', he is slaying the beasts that attack him, but feels remorse. As this character ascends the mountain, new threats face him, his supplies are low, and he begins to freeze to death. As the album ends, our hero breathes his last breath and the heavens beckon him to enter their warm, inviting realm, and he sails away.\n",
        "\nMastodon is a band, that I didn't really get into until their last Full-length, \"Crack The Skye\". I found that I didn't really like their early stuff until much later. To be honest, they are a band that grows on you. I also found that these guys can really play some strange music. That is no different on \"The Hunter\". This record hits notes that are like Blue Oyster Cult, Sabbath and even stuff that sounds like their own style of metal. The new album couldn\u2019t have come sooner, because \u201cCrack The Skye\u201d is starting to get worn out in my brain\u2026\n\nThe new album starts out with the first single, Black Tongue, which to be honest is probably the weakest song on the album. It is a great song, so that\u2019s just showing how good the album is. The instrumental parts of this album were so good. All of the members feed off each other flawlessly. I was impressed with how intense the music could get, then change pace next song and play very soothing and mellow melodies that make your soul tremble. \n\nThe thing about Mastodon that has always astounded me is that all of the members know how to sing and do so in almost every song. Many songs (i.e. Oblivion, \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d) have all of the members harmonizing. It really is a great sound. This record is no different. There were a few songs with one singer at a time and many with multiple people harmonizing. I have always been a fan of Brent Hinds\u2019 voice. He sounds like Ozzy without that whine that can often get on your nerves. Curl The Burl is the song that really stands out when you want to listen to his voice. It\u2019s a really well done song, much like the others on the album.\n\nAs I explained earlier, there are great instrumentals on this album and they flow well. The guitars, bass and drums are all heard very well and all feed off each other amazingly. I really dig how the bass is so loud in half the songs, that you feel it in your stomach. The drums get so fun (coming from a drummer) that I often find myself drumming along. As for the guitars \u2013 holy shit. All I have to say is that they really show the experimental side of this band. They use not only some really weird chords, but also some really weird structures in their music. It all flows, though, which makes it one of the best sounds out there. Experimental music that doesn\u2019t sound like pretentious hipster bullshit or annoying noise music? Yes please.\n\nTo be honest, fans of \u201cRemission\u201d won\u2019t like this. This album is not heavy. It has some heavier songs, but compared to \u201cRemission\u201d, this is like vanilla sorbet. Fans of \u201cLeviathan\u201d may or may not like it, but fans of \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d and \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d will really enjoy this record. It\u2019s really a different listening experience, in a good way. I think this may go down in the Mastodon hall of fame.\n",
        "\nThis is certainly an interesting change in direction. Mastodon seemed quite happy to be moving further into pure prog territory, leaving their sludgy roots behind almost entirely with Crack the Skye. And yet here we have this, something completely different. A curveball if you will. This is a step backwards, perhaps, from its proggy predecessor, but don\u2019t take that to imply inferior quality \u2013 The Hunter is just as good, if not better than the much acclaimed Skye.\n\nThere\u2019s a wide variety of songs here, which, while not always a positive point, certainly acts in the band\u2019s favour here. There are the fast paced songs, the slow, crushing ones, and the languid, drawn-out soundscapes. It manages to, rather than sound mix and match and poorly defined, create an intriguing contrast. Look, for instance, at \u2018Creature Lives\u2019 and its follower \u2018Spectrelight\u2019 (which sees Neurosis\u2019 Scott Kelly guesting) \u2013 the first a slow, relatively soft sounding song that builds up to a climax, the next being a fast assault on the ears. \n\nThis glorious mixture is most apparent on the best songs of the album. \u2018Curl of the Burl\u2019 is, at heart, a down and dirty rock and roll song with a metal overlay. It\u2019s the sort of song that makes you want to bang your head, and is a siren song throughout the whole album. It genuinely seems addictive, with a riff and chorus focus that is surprisingly common on The Hunter and which, more importantly, works. That\u2019s not to say it is overshadowing in any way \u2013 excellent songs like \u2018Dry Bone Valley\u2019, \u2018Black Tongue\u2019, \u2018All the Heavy Lifting\u2019, \u2018Thickening\u2019 and the title track keep things going steadily, despite the changes in pace. Indeed, all the songs on here are obviously well made and all have their own unique flair and charm, which flirts with the flairs and charms of the other songs on the album. Once again, the playing is all top-form, with a relatively reserved performance from all concerned \u2013 less flashy than before, but just as tight and jaw-dropping as always. There has been something of a shift in vocal styles as well, with little growling to be found, and Brann Dailor seems to be taking more of a vocal role \u2013 in particular on \u2018Creature Lives\u2019, composed and sung entirely by him.\n\nThe aforementioned contrast spreads from just the songs themselves to permeate every part of the album. Emotionally, this is a very multi-faceted beast. Mastodon seem to have refound their sense of humour with the likes of \u2018Stargasm\u2019 and (at least in terms of its title) \u2018Octopus Has No Friends\u2019. There is an anger here as well, as is to be expected \u2013 at times a quiet rage, at others a raging beast. But there is also a deep sadness. The catalyst for this album was, according to members of the band, the deaths of those they held close, and it shows here. The slower songs show it more, the title track in particular being rather somber, but it is most evident on closer \u2018The Sparrow.\u2019 A simple song, it has only four words for lyrics, repeated over and over \u2013 \u201cPursue Happiness With Diligence.\u201d And it is amazing how touching it is \u2013 this is a beautiful end to an album, and a beautiful farewell. It is a testament to Mastodon, perhaps, that they can produce something so schizophrenic, so delicately multifaceted, and yet make it sound entirely coherent.\n",
        "\nMastodon is a band that I have great respect and admiration for. They are one of my favorite metal bands, maybe even one of my top bands period. When Blood Mountain came out I listened to it every single day for nearly a year, and it's still one of my favorite albums. Their blend of psychedelic prog and crushing sludge/trash metal was incredibly captivating and highly listenable on that album. Fast forward to 2009, the year they released \"Crack the Skye\", which was my favorite album of that year. They had progressed, no pun intended, into more of a definite \"prog metal\" band with that release in my opinion. Less brutal aggression and more singing, which cause a lot of long-time fans hoping that they would one day return to the sound of Remission of Leviathan to jump ship and call sell-out. But to me, it was really love at first listen from the moment that Oblivion dropped into it's first verse and Brann Dailor started sining. It was a definite change, but it showed that Mastodon didn't want to be tied down and rehash their roots.\n\nWhich brings us to The Hunter, Mastodons 5th full length album. In the interviews I read with the band they stated that this album was going to make a lot of people confused and take more than a couple double takes.Usually when I read statements like that I generally don't hold very high expectations, cause they whole \"changed sound\" thing is pretty overblown in the press, which is what i thought about Nile's last album for example. But upon listening to The Hunter I can safely say that this is an album that may make a lot of fans angry, and definitely even more surprised. \n\nThe Hunter marks another huge step in the bands career, and leaves a lot of comfort zones behind. This is the first album that lacks a concept, like how Remission was fire based, Leviathan was based on Moby Dick, Blood Mountain was about earth and mythical beasts and Crack the Skye was about a paraplegic who gets lost in a wormhole while astral projecting, this album is merely a collection of songs. This is also the first album to feature artwork from AJ Fosik, marking a departure from Paul Ramano who has done all their album artwork to date. \n\nI don't want to say that Mastodon have dumbed down their sound, it's more like they stripped it down. The ban has stated that they were sort of burned out by the heavy concepts and instead just made an album that they wanted to have fun recording and performing. Which I can understand, the last album drew heavy inspiration from the passing of Brann Dailors sister, which I can imagine gets pretty hard to re-live night after night on tour when you have to preform those songs. However, The Hunter is called such in honor of Brent Hinds brother who passed away while making the album.\n\nThis being the case, The Hunter definitely feels like a breath of fresh air for the band. They've created music that I think is a nice mix of everything that they've done to this point, but still feels new. There are some songs that I could see being b-sides to Crack the Skye, like the title track, or \"Black Tongue\", or some of the proggier songs in the last half of \"Blood Mountain\". Though songs like \"Blasteroid\" and \"Spectralight\" still keep the heavy sludge sound. \n\nBut Mastodon have definitely had a lot of fun with this release, just one look at song title like \"The Octopus has no Friends\" or \"Stargasm\" or \"Bedazzled Fingernails\" should tell you that. Again, this may make a lot of fans worried and confused about this bands drastic change. Another thing I have to mention is the incredible increase in vocal talent on this album, especially in regards to Troy Sanders. His singing is phenomenal! When I first heard Black Tongue I was floored by his delievery. It just sucks that he most likely won't be able to pull it off live. Just like Crack the Skye, there is little to no screaming on any of these songs. I'm also happy to hear Brann Dailor singing more on this album, including the entirty of \"Creature Lives\", which is definitely one of the weirder songs on the album. With the swelling synth intro and the epic chord progressions, it sounds like Mastodon found a lost Pink Floyd song from the recording of \"The Wall\" and made it their own. \n\nThere is one thing about this album that I am yet to get over. I am so used to Mastodon making concept albums, that this sudden change to merely a \"collection of songs\" sits a little uneasy for me. I'm so used to putting on a Mastodon album and listening to it all the way through and going on somewhat of a journey through it's concept, which is more of the \"album\" format. I can almost safely say that this flows like a \"mixtape\" than anything else. Lll the songs end independently, none of them lead into each other, and this being the case, I feel like a lot of these songs don't go anywhere, like theres no build up or climax to a lot of these songs. In the end, this feels like an album that I feel like I can skip some tracks and not feel like i'm loosing any of the experience. \n\nBut when I do get done listening to The Hunter, I feel good, I feel really good. This is still a very good album, and one that I feel I have yet to fully appreciate. It's not as good as Crack the Skye, but it's another strong release from an amazing band. A lot of other fans might disagree and yell \"sell-out\" at the bands stripped down, more \"rock\" oriented sounds and structure, but this is a band that refuses to be pinned down and wants to progress. They have integrity, and it's payed off in my book.\n",
        "\nAs the intro riff started playing my head just started banging on it's own. That single riff is better than many actual songs. Catchy, omnious and epic, that is the perfect riff. After the cool and a bit weird verse of the song the chorus strikes in with the intro riff and the amazing \"You kill the light...\" vocal part. At this point I know that the upcoming album will be worth the wait.\n\nSo, the guitar playing is just perfect, what about the vocals? This is one of the best vocal performances of Mastodon's career. Singing coud be described to be calm and urgent at the same time, with some strange but fitting vocal effects. From verses to the amazing chorus, everything is great, fused with the instrumental background this is one of my favorite Mastodon songs.\n\nEvery Mastodon fan knows that the drummer, Brann Dailor, is the essence of the band. And the drumming is pretty damn sweet. I couldn't even imagine that you could play drums like that. All the rhytms are complex but still really cool and the fills are, like always, Brann's greatest strength. And, for everyone who asks, there's no such thing as \"too much filling\".\n\nI took 5% of the rating because of the simple fact that this song is too short. You could listen to this for two hours without a stop. Three and half minutes is just too short. Still, in my opinion, this is the best of the singles released so far, Can't wait for the album.\n",
        "\nLook guys, this album is extremely love/hate for each person that gives it a listen. You're going to listen to it the first time and one of two things will happen. Either you will experience a weird, psychedelic, euphoric music-gasm like most of the reviewers on here apparently had. Or, you'll be like me, and say \"what the hell?! This isn't Mastodon. At least not even close to the way I remember them.\"\n\nUnderstand this: I'm just a casual metalhead who listens to shit on pandora, downloads the whole album that a particular good song is on, listen to the rest of the songs on it once or twice, and if I don't love a certain song, I delete it without hesitation before transferring everything to my MP3 player. Music is awesome but I don't obsess over deep lyrical meanings and tiny nuances in supposedly legendary riffs that require an esoteric sense of music comprehension to fully appreciate. Perhaps this makes me somewhat of a \"common\" man, if you will, but so be it.\n\nThat said, if you are the kind of person that derives extreme pleasure from listening to cryptic, mystical music pieces, you're going to love this album. It's got plenty of rich, floaty psychedelic riffage and shit to launch your brain into the throes of ecstasy with every listen. Honestly, even I slightly enjoy a few choice parts from the album, maybe a section or two from songs like The Czar, Crack the Skye, and Divinations.\n\nBUT. IF you are like me at all. You're going to be like WTF man. IMO, Remission was great, a delicious, raw new prog metal album. Leviathan was even better, with more unique riffs and overall generally better. Blood Mountain was a step down, but still pretty darn good because it's Mastodon dude!! And then Crack The Skye came along, and messed up the whole thing. Yeah some people are going to be like \"whoa, the change is great man, they're experimenting and it totally worked, it's so cool to see their music 'evolving'\" but this is a very drastic change, and you know what? I liked Mastodon just the way they were when Brann was blasting out ridiculous, unpredictable jazz drumming and Brent was shredding out beautiful, heavy riffs on such songs as Capillarian Crest and Bladecatcher. I miss that. Where is it on this album? Nowhere. Just spacey, soft, slow, pussified music that I would probably rather use as a lullaby than something I'd actually take time out of my day to listen to for pleasure.\n\nAs unforgiving as Empyreal's review may be, I have to say that he pretty much hit the nail on the head. And he has a right to be pissed off. What the hell happened to the awesome Mastodon we used to know? I sincerely hope they just don't get big heads from all the positive reviews they're getting, and play all the songs from this stupid album at a future concert that I might potentially go to, performing only a few songs from their GOOD albums.\n\nLike I said boys and girls, you're going to absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. Give it a listen on grooveshark and see which side you take before you buy it.\n",
        "\nI found Mastodons' Live At The Aragon (CD version) to be very subpar. Anyone looking to be wowed will surely be disappointed. \n\nThey played the entire Crack The Skye album, but the sound quality is so bad that your better off listening to the studio album instead. The other tracks don't really build confidence in the abum either. If you were hoping to hear songs like \"Blood And Thunder\", \"Iron Tusk\", or March Of The Fire Ants\", then don't look here.\n\nAs I listened to the cd I found that the songs tended to blend into one. First I was on track 1, then when I looked again I was on track 4, but it didn't really sound any different. I didn't even notice different songs were playing. \n\nThis cd is not a very good product by Mastodon. If your going to record a live album, then you should take the time to do it right. Make sure it's the right show, the right venue. Put some time into the set list so you can give the fans one hell of a live album. This was just some throw away show that got recorded and slapped onto a disc and put out. \n\nYou should only get it if your a diehard Mastodon fan. If your not a diehard.....then wait for a better live album.\n",
        "\nAlthough this is the third Mastodon album I've experienced, I will say that it is the first that I've really felt a connection with; my own rosetta stone so to speak, for this Atlantan metal quartet.\n\nAfter two sludgy albums- the latter of which propelling Mastodon to the forefront of the metal scene- Mastodon's third record 'Blood Mountain' is the logical follow-up to their breakthrough; an album that takes the sound they became famous with, and turns it on its side. While there is still the aggression and edgy vibe here that gave 'Remission' and 'Leviathan' the power to succeed as records, there is a new, progressive approach the band takes, emphasizing technicality and a deeply psychedelic dimension now.\n\nThe sheer 'out there' nature of the album and trippy overtones makes the album special for Mastodon, even when compared to their more generally acclaimed album 'Crack The Skye'. Opening with a number more traditional of the band's older style, 'The Wolf Is Loose' kicks off the album in a fairly deceptive fashion, while it is evident that the band has tightened up their act from 'Leviathan', things are very riff-based and sludgy for the first two tracks. While generally quite good, charged and fiery songs, 'Blood Mountain' doesn't hit its real stride until 'Sleeping Giant' (the third track) rolls around. The intro sounds like something a dark psychedelic band would do, although the heaviness is still kept in check. From there on in, 'Blood Mountain' continues to develop it's unique sound.\n\n'Capillarian Crest' shows the album's blistering technicality, a trait more often attributed to progressive metal than any sludge act out there. The weirdness culminates with the odd instrumental 'Bladecatcher', whose freakishly chaotic nature features electronic ramblings that almost sound like WALL-E (yes, of the Pixar film) is doing a guest feature. My personal favourite track on the album is 'Colony Of Birchmen', which seamlessly flows between deep grooves and more emotionally resonant sections.\n\nSporting their newfound fame, there are also a couple of very notable guest vocalists on the album. Of most interest to the metalhead would be Scott Kelly, of post-metal titans Neurosis. Also here is Cedric Bixler-Zavala of latin-tinged prog rock band The Mars Volta, an overt statement by Mastodon and their new alignment towards psychedelic music. Unfortunately, neither of these vocalists are used nearly as well as they could have been. While the singing done by the band members of Mastodon works quite well here, hearing a part from Zavala beyond some ambient wailing in 'Siberian Divide' would have made it quite a bit more than being merely worth having the guest's names on the packaging.\n\n'Blood Mountain' has plenty of fantastic moments and a very fresh sound for metal, but it does so at the expense of cohesion, a problem that would later be fixed by 'Crack The Skye'. Partially due to the fact that the album is so ambitious with its sound, the album often feels very over the place, and many of the transitions between tracks feel half-baked and ineffective.\n\nThe fact remains however; before listening to Mastodon's 'Blood Mountain', I did not readily consider me a fan of the band, even a mild critic of what I perceived to be a fairly overrated act. After hearing the band in their element here however, I have been able to appreciate the band as a whole, and especially their most musical work 'Crack The Skye' so much more. An excellent, adventurous piece of work.\n",
        "\nMastodon has certainly become a different band over the years, developing from this sludge trash combo band into proclaimed \u201cHard Rock Masters\u201d, as the label on Crack the Skye tells you. The two bands are hardly related aside from the band members, name, etc., and both of them are good bands. However, it is important to know where these globally recognized musicians began their careers together.\n\nRemission certainly has an interesting cover, as a horse being eviscerated by some unknown force would catch the attention of many an eye. The sole artwork on the back contrasts that with a faceless man, and the artwork in the lyrics booklet is no less than peculiar, as are the lyrics that they provide the backdrop for. Speaking of which, the band does an interesting job with lyrics, delivering poetic storytelling with but a few words. At other times, such as in Mother Puncher (awesome name for a song, by the way), provide a relatively different set of emotions, to say the least.\n\nThe vocals on this album are very different from later Mastodon, when they have some guy doing really whiny stuff. Here, though, we have some guy doing some awesome screaming/shouting stuff. I\u2019m not exactly sure, which band member, they all pitch in on vocals except for Dailor. These vocals don\u2019t always fit the songs, as in Where Strides the Behemoth, and even in Trampled Under Foot it just does not fit with the whole style of the song. They did make a nice choice of presenting the listener with a song free of vocals in the closer track, Elephant Man.\n\nDon\u2019t let this tarnish your view, on almost every other song this guy dominates. Workhorse is the best example of his ability to truly drive the song, and the chorus of March of the Fire Ants delivers with the whole band screaming \u201cBone grave, bone engraved\u201d. Magic moment right there folks; but not the magic moment of the album; we will get to that later. The previously mentioned Mother Puncher also shows the vocalist really getting into it, and the results of his connection to the lyrics help make the song memorable.\n\nThe guitar provides mostly sludge based riffing with some intense thrash influences that help provide chugging riffs. March of the Fire Ants and Crusher Destroyer have really unique riffs that stick with you for the rest of the album, as you, the listener, dare Mastodon to see if they can top themselves. Burning Man also has one of the most bone crushing chugging riffs in existence at the climax of the song (I need not tell you when, you will now when it hits you square in the face).\n\nThe solos are also varied on the album. March of the Fire Ants contains one of my absolute favorite guitar solos, and Crusher Destroyer gives you a short burst of extreme thrash complete with that 15 second or so solo. The guitars also do a nice job of slowing things down, with some interesting distortion on the guitars in Ol\u2019e Nessie nicely transforming the song away from the rest of the album. Trilobite, which also features a beastly CELLO part that shows Mastodon going outside of the sludge thrash album conceptualized. More importantly, the guitar part slows down and devastates the listener with brute force, showing technicality and control of their instruments.\n\nThe mix does not feature much in the bass department, but if you turn up the bass, you can hear it, and this guy is running on a different bar than any other bassist I\u2018ve heard (which, granted, is not many, but nonetheless that\u2019s what I think). He is just going all over his bass, and there is little to no audible melody aside from his consistent playing on the string that does keep the pace going as fast as possible. It is from here that you get that ever present thrash element that just keeps moving.\n\nNow, I have been waiting so long to talk about this guy. I love the drummer. Brenn Dailor is an absolute madman and I\u2019m surprised that he does not wreck his drum set after a single song. He is all over that thing the only person that can even possibly be in the same class as him could be George Kollias, so you can see the high esteem that I hold him in. Every song is precisely drummed, yet it retains that sense of absolute chaos. His double bass pedal work is fantastic, never reusing a rhythm, and mixing it up with different time signatures. I can\u2019t even list all of the time signatures he goes through, but I am pretty sure I picked up on 6/8 and 7/4 rhythms, so this guy knows his stuff.\n\nDailor is the driving force for this band. The entire beginning of March of the Fire Ants is essentially a well timed drum solo that keeps going, maintaining that march intensity that makes me love that song. Even versus the later work that he has put out keeps that same thrash-all-over-the-place atmosphere, even if it does become a bit toned down. Even watching live videos of him, he performs every bit as well live as he does on the record. He also manages to do a great job in providing that intense ambiance in Elephant Man, which is expertly put together.\n\nThere are two songs on this album that I felt truly stood apart as amazing and why Mastodon was able to kick start their career when somebody heard how awesome it was and they got more attention. The first is Elephant Man, which is an 8 minute instrumental that closes out the end of the album. The guitars layer on each other with hyper melodic solo licks and a bass part that subtly keeps it together. The drums are slowed down here and are still precise with original beats. This song features solos that are intensely melodic and again show that control and originality that distinguishes this album from typical sludge metal. The song closes out with a long silence and the sound of pouring rain, adding ambiance and they truly make the song complete.\n\nMy favorite song, by far though, is March of the Fire Ants. But I think that should be obvious as most of this review thus far has been pretty obvious worship of this song. It is incredibly original with its march style with the drumming and that brutal opening riff. The vocals are all over this song, demanding attention where it is well deserved. The chorus is infectious, yet hardcore, and the guitar takes a backseat during the chorus, creating a nice balance in the song. However, the solos are absolutely amazing. I cannot emphasize this enough. Also, there is an amazing video that you can watch for free online, something rather out of the ordinary for an American band (Grand Funk Railroad reference for those of you into classic rock).\n\nIn short, this album is a definitive early work of one of my favorite bands, so it is good to refer back to their roots, which you can\u2019t say they have been true to. But this is a fantastic work of music that does not receive enough attention due to their mainstream reputation. All in all, I recommend checking out this album, regardless of what you may have heard about them. Best songs: March of the Fire Ants, Elephant Man, Crusher Destroyer, Trilobite, and Burning Man. Yeah, that\u2019s a lot, but this is an awesome album.\n",
        "\nNow I have done myself the favor of not seeing Jonah Hex, the 80\u2019s action B movie gone big screen terribly wrong, so I am not sure how this fits into the movie. However, Mastodon does a nice job of giving us some relatively simple instrumentals that do in fact have more to it. I was a bit disappointed with \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d considering how much I loved \u201cRemission\u201d, but this was a step back that style.\n\nMastodon doing instrumentals has never really occurred to me, as they are far from invoking a long instrumental section on many of their albums. A lot of atmosphere that was used on \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d came from psychedelic vocals, while here they need to accomplish that and more without that. For the most part, they do.\n\nSome songs on here provide vivid imagery (Clayton Boys and Indian Theme), while others are better looked at as an individual song. Those songs styled with atmosphere and ambiance that brings about images are very short, and don\u2019t contain that trademark progressive rock aspect that is now Mastodon\u2019s niche. The guitars are very mellow and for once, the drumming takes a backseat to melody. The other songs don\u2019t really fit in as backdrop music, but rather as instrumentals that are songs that simply lack vocals. I am admittedly not too big on this idea, as I find Dream Theater instrumentals and ambient metal very intriguing by trying to comprehend what they are trying to symbolize through music.\n\nNow songs like Death March and Train Assault are very good songs, but they are not good instrumentals by my definition. Train Assault has very rigid chorus and refrain song structures, while Death March is overloaded with doom metal influences. The latter was interesting because, while not a great song, shows me a side of Mastodon that I really am not familiar with. It is also on these styled songs that Dailor makes his presence known, which is welcomed from his relative absence on the other tracks. His drumming is what you expect from him and does not disappoint.\n\nAs I\u2019ve said, there are two distinct parts to the album. Disregarding the two opening tracks, as the alternative versions are vastly improved with background solos, the organization makes sense. Indian Theme leads in with some detailed imagery and then Train Assault and Death March hit hard as more mainstream instrumentals and Clayton Boys close us out with\u2026acoustic guitar? That was something featured here that I have not heard Mastodon use.\n\nThe guitars range from bland to interesting, while some are just plain slow. There is not any consistency there on this short lsiten, but I suppose working with the time constraints of a shorter album, you do not have that kind of leeway. Bass does not come through with maddening tremolo picking as it has on so many other Mastodon releases, which disappoints me, but you can\u2019t get everything you want.\n\nThe lack of vocals on this mini album makes it a good deal more listenable than \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d, but it does come off as rather bland. There are many spots where they could have done more, but it simply does not go anywhere. However, it is a soundtrack and out of the box for Mastodon, so credit must be given there. Death March shows a different side and Train Assault does some nice heavy riffing, but this is not a must buy. If you like repetitive instrumentals like me, go for it.\n",
        "\nWhen I first saw the trailers for the movie Jonah Hex, I thought it looked like an expertly assembled trailer for an awful-looking movie. Turns out, it's a box office bomb. I seem to have kind of a good sense for that, as I thought the same about certain other Megan Fox movies with cool trailers that turned out to be awful. The woman has never been in a good movie.\n\nI will probably get the movie on Netflix, though, and that's for one reason alone: Mastodon did the music.\n\nBut there's an awful story to go behind that one. Apparently, they had to do the music a second time, since the scenes they did it for ended up on the cutting floor. (I thought you weren't supposed to score a movie until after it was fully edited.) The Wikipedia article describes things well:\n\n-----\n\nThe new soundtrack was taken in a \"more restrained, subtle\" musical direction\u2014contrasting the original version which had been described as \"pretty heavy\" with \"vigorous shredding.\"\n\nWhile Mastodon had originally described the process of composing a soundtrack in October 2009 as \"very pure, it was real creative and totally spur of the moment\" and expected \"nothing in return but satisfaction in being a part of something incredible,\" the band found it frustrating to have to rewrite a new score and start from scratch. According to guitarist Brent Hinds, who was disappointed about having to start over, \"It was some of the best shit I've ever written in my life. Now I'm just trying to finish with as much patience as possible.\"\n\n-----\n\nSo, what we are left with is the frustrated and pissed-off remnants of genius forced to start from scratch and do the same thing over again on a very limited timetable.\n\nGiven that backstory, the results are surprisingly listenable. As it is intended as a movie score, it comes off as atmospheric sludge metal (or maybe post-metal in the original meaning of that term). The EP opens rather poorly, with a nearly nine-minute, highly atmospheric track called \"Death March\". It's honestly pretty dull. (I'm sure it sounds good in the background of the movie, but to just listen to it isn't worthwhile.) After that, the next three tracks are much shorter and faster-paced, and get progressively better. A slightly longer alternate version of \"Death March\" follows, with some very interesting lead guitar work unlike anything I've heard. It ends with an alternate version of \"Clayton Boys\", the best thing on the album, which also has a lot of the strange lead guitar work.\n\nThe Verdict: It is a bit disappointing that they had to release something that wasn't what they wanted to release. I only hope the other stuff will see the light of day at some point, and I have a feeling it will end up on a boxed set.\n\nOverall, I have to recommend this only to dedicated Mastodon fans (like myself). Despite that, the last two tracks alone (the alternate versions) make it worth the very cheap price tag--or, if nothing else, a download of just those two. \n\noriginally written for http://fullmetalattorney.blogspot.com/\n",
        "\nOkay, so this makes more sense then the A7X/Mastodon split, but it still doesn\u2019t feel right. Perhaps if this had been done during the \u201cCrack The Skye\u201d/\u201dDiamond Eyes\u201d era it would have made more sense as both of those records are moody, introverted, and deal with losing those close to you. But instead we have a weak song from a less than solid Deftones album, and one of the best songs off of Mastodon\u2019s last truly balls to the wall metal album. Things don\u2019t really add up.\n\nDeftones have never been that great at up-tempo numbers like \u201cRapture\u201d. They\u2019ve always worked best when they focus on atmosphere and mood than aggression. Chino Moreno has never been that great of a singer, but he\u2019s even worse when he\u2019s forced to scream instead of croon as he is on this song. The song doesn\u2019t have any real riffs to speak of, just some minor chord progressions and an off kilter groove that makes liberal use of weird accents in order to try and engage the listener. These two sections are repeated haphazardly with no discernable structure. The parts themselves harder stand up on their own, so being mashed together this way doesn\u2019t do them much good. The only interesting part of the song comes at the end when the 70\u2019s synthesizer floats over the otherwise bland chords. This doesn\u2019t save the song from being one of the Deftones worst.\n\n\u201cCrystal Skull\u201d on the other hand is one of Mastodon\u2019s best. In it\u2019s short run time it glides seamlessly through five equally compelling sections. The song opens in classic Mastodon style using a driving riff and complex drumming to push the listener onward towards the dynamic bridge section. Here the band jumps from near silence to soaring guitar harmonies and back again before letting it rip with towering power chords. Finally any song that goes from rumbling Neurosis influenced tom grooves (with Scott Kelly himself on vocals no less!) to a classic rock style guitar solo instantly gets points in my book. \u201cCrystal Skull\u201d represents all the ways in which Mastodon were at the top of their game. It\u2019s heavy and complex, but easily digestible and instantly memorable. It features tons of parts; each building on the next and no element ever feels out of place from the others.\n\nIn other words, Mastodon succeeds here in every way that Deftones fail. As a result this is a very lopsided split and you\u2019re probably better off just picking up \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d. If you want to see what Deftones are actually good at, listen to either \u201cDiamond Eyes\u201d or \u201cWhite Pony\u201d.\n",
        "\nWho exactly is this trying to appeal to? I understand that this is a major label\u2019s attempt to crossbreed fan bases, but seriously, someone clearly did not do their research. In the mainstream metal world, I struggle to think of two bands that are further apart in style and demographic appeal than Avenged Sevenfold and Mastodon. Mastodon plays exclusively to the bearded, snobby intellectual crowd, and have played at both Pitchfork Music Festival and All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties. Avenged Sevenfold have legions of screaming fan girls in black nail polish and are about to tour with Hellyeah. So it looks we have the classic case of jocks versus nerds on this split, and I think we all know who\u2019s going to win this one.\n\nI might get some shit for this, but I don\u2019t think \u201cBeast in the Harlot\u201d is that bad of a song, except for the cringe-inducing chorus. If it weren\u2019t for M.Shadow\u2019s completely emasculate and whiny vocals and that really stupid chorus (complete with the totally predictable and corny key change) this would probably be a pretty damn good song. It isn\u2019t anything unique by any means but the song moves at a quick pace, the riffs are fun, the solos are solid and there\u2019s tons of double bass. For modern mainstream rock this is actually pretty stellar tune, expect for that GOD AWEFUL chorus. The mood is one of simple mindless fun and the song works as perfectly harmless party rock. \u201cBat Country\u201d on the other hand is just plain bad. Any chance that the verse riff had of sounding menacing is completely destroyed by the most obnoxious vocal hook in the world. Things get even worse when they decide to thrown in the single lamest soft section known to man not just once, but twice. This has got to be the most pathetic attempt at adding variety to a song. It doesn\u2019t fit the mood and Shadow\u2019s can\u2019t hold a tune to save his life at lower dynamics. These songs are also hilariously overproduced. The snare and bass drums are clearly sound replaced and the guitars have no real bite to them.\n\nI\u2019m sort of a weird Mastodon fan in that I don\u2019t think Leviathan is anywhere near as good it\u2019s cracked up to be, but holy fuck do these songs rule in comparison to their competition. \u201cBlood & Thunder\u201d is the stronger of the two songs on this side, mainly because it excels in so many areas. There\u2019s the fun bouncy verse riff, the epic proggy guitar harmonies in the middle of the song and that giant Neurosis-esque riff at the end. All the while Brann Dailor does what he does best, which is batter the listener with constant sixteenth note rolls. This is not to say that \u201cIron Tusk\u201d is a bad song. On the contrary, its opening riff is one of the heaviest and most badass in the band\u2019s catalogue. The rest of the song is no slouch either, making clever use of guitar harmonies by switching the lead instrument in the middle of the melody. The way that the band develops the chugging bridge riff into a discordant monster worthy of Converge is nothing short of awesome. The band hadn\u2019t developed their songwriting skills to the level that they would on \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d and they aren\u2019t reaching for prog mastery that they would with \u201cCrack The Skye\u201d but these songs prove that Mastodon have always had balls of steel and riffs to back it up.\n\nUnless you\u2019re an Avenged Sevenfold fanatic this isn\u2019t worth your time or money. If you like Mastodon you probably already have \u201cLeviathan\u201d and don\u2019t want any A7X mucking things up for you. If you\u2019re not aware of either of these bands, just go buy \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d and stay as far away from the first half of this disc as you can.\n",
        "\nThis albums release is the time of which Mastodon more or less started getting more and more recognition in the metal scene. Indeed, listening to this album a few times will make you realize just why it did; the consistent flow of the album really makes the listener get hooked to it beginning to end, but at the same time there\u2019s enough new stuff to recognize each listen that it takes a very long time for the album to get old. That was one of the major flaws that Mastodon had with Remission; on that album, there were clear highlights but also clear filler, and while it was a good album it was far more inconsistent than Leviathan in sheer quality. I can listen to Leviathan beginning to end and not get bored once; Remission I need to skip a few tracks in order to get to the good stuff. \n\nThat being said, the overall flow Leviathan has that Remission wasn\u2019t able to have lends Leviathan one particular advantage; it\u2019s ability to manageably reveal its part in the \u201celements\u201d theme that Mastodon finally finished with Crack the Skye. In fact, Mastodon\u2019s illustration of water (the element obviously to be depicted on this album) shines not only in comparison to Remission, but all of the albums they\u2019ve done. That\u2019s not to say that the later albums were completely void of the elements they were to represent, but you can tell Mastodon really tried to incorporate the \u201cwater\u201d theme into this album. I mean; just look at the album cover. The huge splashing waves with a magnificent looking Sperm Whale dipping its large head out of them, practically crushing a ship in half; if that image right there doesn\u2019t make you think \u201cI wonder if this album has any water themed material in it\u201d then I don\u2019t know what will. (as a side note- the album cover of Leviathan is by far my favorite one of theirs so far. Its definite influence from the romantic era really sticks out compared to the rest of their album covers). If familiarized with Moby Dick, the album artwork should make you wonder if Leviathan has a strong influence from the tale, of which you would be correct. All the lyrics are heavily influenced by Herman Melville\u2019s epic novel, and it\u2019s done very well. Songs like I Am Ahab have lyrics that practically paraphrase pages from the novel, even mixing around quotes from the book. The lyrics are ultimately standard metal lyrics, but if you\u2019ve read the novel reading the lyrics may be of interest to you.\n\nBut Leviathan wouldn\u2019t be able to express the Melville perspective of water just on lyrics alone. Unlike most concept albums these days that carry the concept in the lyrics alone, the general concept of water/Moby Dick is carried in the instruments as well. Mastodon musically writes Leviathan\u2019s concepts in a very sludgy kind of way. Nothing on this album is taken at really fast speeds, or at supreme technicality. Its riffs are very catchy, rhythmically groovy, and may even get stuck in your head for a long while. However, this is rather interesting because Leviathans drumming is quite different. It\u2019s not handled under 180 BPM blast beats or some really restrained rhythm friendly drum beats. The drumming is more in the realm of grindcore, almost reminding me of Lykathea Aflame, Wormed, or even some of Cynics drumming. It creates an odd backing to the guitars, almost painting a picture that shows everything on the surface as slow moving, but underneath more going on than you know. Many people find this to be their main frustration with the album, but the drumming in the album is what really sold the album for me because it puts unexpectedness over what\u2019s expected- meaning that you always get a general feeling of how the guitars are going to play, but that won\u2019t always be the case with the drums. The vocals are almost like the drums in that regard, as Mastodon varies the vocal style throughout the entire album. Leviathan still employs screaming more than Mastodon\u2019s later albums, but it\u2019s not always the same. The screams for the most part sound like a typical sludge metal kind of scream in the vein of Neurosis or Isis, but there\u2019s more than a few moments where they decide to change things up a bit. The most apparent change is in Aqua Dementia when the band decides to use a more high pitched vocal sound in a few sections. \n\nUnfortunately, Leviathan still has some very minor problems with it. For one, it feels like the guitars are at times restraining their creativity. This is especially true with the first track Blood and Thunder; though very simple, after a few listens to it there\u2019s a bit of me that makes me think they could have done something more to it. The outro track Joseph Merrick feels like this to. It doesn\u2019t feel well rehearsed, almost like they whipped the parts of it together really fast. It\u2019s not bad, but it could have certainly been done a lot better.\n\nLeviathan was Mastodon\u2019s huge stepping stone into the metal world. Yeah; it didn\u2019t transcend into other realms of music like their later albums do, but it sure as hell got them enough recognition to even be signed to a major record label. It also was the first sludge album for me, getting me into more bands of the similar sound like Isis or Cult of Luna, so if you want to start venturing into the sludge sound, this is where I recommend starting.\n",
        "\nMastodon is a band that I have long loathed and have written off as a trailblazing predecessor to that of The Sword, both of which have been putting out sub-par versions of traditional doom and sludge respectively and have amassed a legion of religiously devoted fans, comprised primarily of pseudo-metal hipster types. Mastodon\u2019s transgressions against the gods of steel guising as albums are noted for excess showboating by the drummer, meshed against songwriting that is either garbled and lacking organization, or so woefully steeped in clich\u00e9 and outwardly formulaic that they were largely unbearable to any ear trained in the interpreting the sonic nuances outside the pop or jam band paradigm. Nevertheless, while The Sword has continued to sully the good name of Saint Vitus and Black Sabbath mercilessly, these Georgians have managed to make the rounds a bit and have put together an album that is actually reasonable to listen to.\n\n\u201cCrack The Skye\u201d is all but a full fledged throwback in terms of style, hearkening to various 70s influences to augment an otherwise mud drenched sound, as can be guessed by the similarity that the album title shares with a somewhat obscure American rock band from said era. Bits of mid-70s Black Sabbath, most particularly that of \u201cSabotage\u201d intermingle with some pieces of Manilla Road and Rainbow. The atmosphere is quite dense, as the riff work ventures frequently from Groove drones to more Progressive rhythmic devices, while a dense bass production and a thick haze of cymbal crashes and drum work covers the 4 corners of the outworking sound like oil over loud pumping engine pistons. But while all of this is only a moderate departure from the band\u2019s sound as heard on \u201cLeviathan\u201d, the ears of all who love coherence will be pleased to hear that Brann Dailor has finally decided to settle down and keep the beat rather than drown out everyone else with pretentious fills every 4 seconds.\n\nIn spite of all the noteworthy improvements going on here, this is pretty far removed from a perfect album. The clean vocals have still retained a rather unpleasantly excessive nasal quality to them, often being akin to Ozzy Osbourne meets Mark Shelton with a really bad fit of the common cold. It\u2019s not quite as offensive as was the case on \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d, but on a lot of the more vocally oriented songs like \u201cThe Last Baron\u201d and \u201cDivinations\u201d it is pretty damned pervasive and draws the ears away from some otherwise intricate music. There is also an occasional tendencies towards over-ambitiousness, particularly on \u201cThe Last Baron\u201d, which suffers from having a few too many ideas for its own good. Picture a really contorted mixture of Kyuss, Dream Theater, Trouble, and a host of 70s Progressive outfits and you\u2019ll get the idea. It\u2019s not outwardly terrible like some other overlong songs that are in this band\u2019s back catalog, but it gets pretty awkward after the first 6 minutes. \n\nIf someone wanted to give this band a first time listen, this would be the album to start with, and in my opinion the only one really worth getting. It is definitely geared towards an audience comprised of psychedelic stoner rockers and progressive rock nuts, ergo a lot of people with beards, ponytails, and tucked-in t-shirts. It\u2019s not the earth-shattering masterpiece that many are hyping it as, but for what it is, it gets the job done. For what it\u2019s worth, this album has turned one of this band\u2019s most hardened skeptics into one that sees a bit of potential looming for future releases, provided that they maintain this stylistic direction of course. \n\nOriginally submitted to (www.metal-observer.com) on March 9, 2010.\n",
        "\nAs with most things concerning the band Mastodon, I'm torn between what sounds like some healthy ideas and the obvious flaws of the music. \"Call of the Mastodon\" is a compilation album, just under a half hour in length, which chronicles the earlier, pre-\"Remission\" material by this band. The choices made here are rather easily linked to later, more familiar material. The album itself has more of a gritty atmosphere one can instantly associate with the sludge metal scene. Considering some of the band members were influenced by bands like The Melvins, this is understandable.\n\nSo what does this album represent? It basically represents the early days of this band. The progressive tendencies are there, as are the leanings into random noise and mass confusion concerning the drum beats, though the former is not as present here as later on. Brann Dailor continues to annoy the hell out of me, and I wish someone would inform him his days in a grindcore outfit are over, and its time to put the self-indulgence behind. I say this because as evident by \"Shadows that Move\" and \"Thank You for This,\" among others, he has little content for maintaining a straight beat. Some call this impressive, I call it randomness personified, which causes the songs to suffer in terms of memorability and overall the enjoyment of the listener. \n\nAside from the drumming issues, which one will always encounter when dealing with this band, most things here are actually quite good. The vocals are actually better here than later on, emitting a misanthropic growl that sludge fans probably won't mind. Sure the vocals are ugly as hell, but they also morph into cleaner (yet gritty) vocals and they suit the sludge infested music well. The lyrics aren't all that spectacular, and don't follow a common theme such as the fire, water, and earth elements that later works would.\n\nIn terms of songs, I found few here that were truly memorable. \"Battle at Sea\" would be one, with its somber beginning before morphing into a decent number. The usual indulgences of Mastodon still arise even here, but to a lesser extent. \"Call of the Mastodon\" also fits here and is also one of the better songs. The shorter numbers like \"Hail to Fire\" and \"Thank You for This\" are around the two minute mark, but both are pretty hard to keep up with and to recall. Essentially, alot of this runs in usual Mastodon fashion in that they embody good songs with ill-fitted ideas and randomness running amok. \n\nTaken as a whole, \"Call of the Mastodon\" is actually not all that bad. It isn't necessarily that good, either. Instead, its a glimpse into the future of this band, while remaining heavily tied to the dirty sludge metal approach. I found most of this album fairly enjoyable while it was playing, though I also found most of it hard to remember. Of course, if you're a Mastodon fan, you're used to this so it shouldn't bother you too much. Those listeners interested in this band might want to check out \"Leviathan,\" which is the most straight-forward work and indeed the best album this band has done. Keep in mind I used the word \"random\" alot in the review, which refers to most of the music this band has put out. Most of this is caused by the drummer, who refuses to understand where and when overly technical drumming is appropiate, and where it is not, thus resulting in a tidal wave of unnecessary drum fills and beat changes. Yet in the case of \"Call of the Mastodon,\" I recommend this only to Mastodon fans and perhaps sludge metal fans as well, who will get two songs in \"Battle at Sea\" and \"Slickleg,\" that lay off the structural confusion long enough to present an enjoyable and memorable song.\n",
        "\nA few weeks ago, I penned a nice little review of Mastodon's \"Leviathan,\" in which I described it as the only album worth seeking out by this band. Since that time, I have spun a few more listens of \"Blood Mountain\" and come to a reformed opinion. While I have never, nor will likely ever praise this band as a force of innovation done right, \"Blood Mountain\" is getting a better response out me. I still wouldn't consider it a more worthy listen than \"Leviathan\" was, much less hailing it as one of the best albums of the 21st Century.\n\nConsidering that categorizing this band has led to genre names like groove metal, metalcore, sludge and progressive being thrown out, its only natural this band would sound rather original. Yet originality doesn't always equal quality, as Mastodon has proven in spades over their relatively short career. Unlike \"Leviathan,\" which had a few discipherable song structures that proved quite enjoyable, \"Blood Mountain\" often ventures off into the world of random noise. This noise, when taken as a whole, attempts to create something out of its technicality and creative processes, yet in the end usually conjures up something that is both unpredictable and boring at times. You do get a few instances of traditional songwriting trying to punch through the random noise, such as \"Crystal Skull\" and \"Colony of Birchmen,\" so its none too surprising songs like these are some of the better songs this album offers. \n\nWhile \"Blood Mountain\" is more organized and moves less into the world of outright random suckage that \"Remission\" often fell into, the album seems to magnify the flaws present on \"Leviathan.\" I applaud the band for mixing in a few new influences into the game, such as taking a whack at stoner metal tendencies on \"Sleeping Giant,\" which is pretty decent minus the obvious meandering. This same kind of influence can be heard on \"Siberian Divide,\" though to a lesser extent. Its not surprising Mastodon would include these influences on this album, considering the album artwork looks like a bad acid trip through a psychedelic backwoods hell. Still, just like the cover art, the music succeeds in grabbing your attention and interest, then leaving you wondering what in the hell this all means. \n\nAs I said before, the best songs off this album follow a more traditional approach to music. Keep in mind during my analysis of the songs that the key flaw in this band, Brann Dailor, continues to be self-indulgent on the drums and showboats like no tomorrow. I'm with hells_unicorn on this one, as Dailor often ruins the experience for me considering on some songs he is constantly changing the beat and throwing drum fills out the ass. However, that doesn't stop songs like the speed metal of \"The Wolf Is Loose\" or the groovy (and at times, meandering) \"Crystal Skull\" from being enjoyable. \"Colony of Birchmen\" is also pretty decent, though the vocals and the song itself often remind me of something out of a heavier alternative rock band. \"Sleeping Giant\" hits with the stoner influences, as I said before, and besides the usual meandering that Mastodon excels at, the song is also fairly good. Of course, this wouldn't be a Mastodon release if there weren't an abundance of pointless and often comical noises and music sections thrown into the mix. Since I sometimes tend to enjoy Mastodon, this does not outrightly bother me, but I will say it gets pretty fucking annoying on repeat listens.\n\nAside from some decent metal songs and plenty of meandering for your enjoyment, we also run into some problems. These problems usually carry over from album to album with Mastodon. However, the commendable efforts of \"Leviathan,\" which corrected many of the randomness issues of \"Remission,\" have been lost and the band has relapsed into a musical game of Russian Roulette, sometimes you're spared, sometimes you get the bullet and wish you could just end it all. An excellent example of this is \"Capallarian Crest\" which is so damn hard to follow and recall its not even funny and this song is awfully hard to stomach. The other example of this is \"Pendulous Skin,\" which goes on for 20 minutes. Yes, 20 minutes of Mastodon's usual aimless wondering, pointless noises, and a horribly failed attempt at \"epic\" songwriting. Since this is the third excessively long song this band has written, alongside \"Elephant Man\" and \"Heart's Alive,\" I'm guessing they refuse to admit they can't write an interesting song over five minutes in length to save their own asses. Other instances of this band's ususal \"uselessness thrown in for the hell of it,\" would come into \"Siberian Divide,\" which would have been pretty decent were it not for those god awful noises that first appear at the 1:46 mark and then come up two or three more times to completely kill the listen.\n\nThis album actually gets me pretty disgusted at times, because there are enough good ideas on here to constitute a good listening experience. I'd even dare say Mastodon often do push the envelope of innovation, at least as far as their sludge metal and groove metal altars will allow them to. Yet this band always finds ways to come up with contrasting ideas that make bearing their entire albums a tedious chore instead of an enthralling listen. If they run out of ideas, then they simply meander around, throwing in random spurts of noise and Brann Dailor's ever annoying drum wankery. With that said, I still find Mastodon fairly enjoyable from time to time, but they are certainly not the next \"saviors of metal,\" nor are they close to it. Instead, this band represents a concept where randomness prevails, giving you this swamp of musical waste that might spawn something interesting or something completely ugly and horrid. Either way, \"Blood Mountain\" is a definite step down from \"Leviathan,\" because it gives you five songs that are enjoyable and some that are flat out unbearable. The misguided legions of Mastodon loyalists will definitely find something to like about this, but those like me who let the music do the talking, this is worth maybe $4 out of your pocket. There just isn't enough quality music on here to let me recommend a higher price with a conscious mind.\n",
        "\nThough hyped up something big by the mainstream media, I have taken Mastodon for what they are: a sludgy metalcore/groove metal band in the 21st century. Naturally, since they do lean in the realm of technical music and sound slightly better than most of the metalcore scene today, they've been hyped as some kind of metal messiah in the new millenium. We pretty much heard the exact same thing over bands like Killswitch Engage and Lamb of God a few years ago, both of whom have yet to live up to the hype.\n\nI've spent some time collecting my thoughts on this band, taking them at face value and ignoring their overrated status. My conclusion is the same so many already have come to, and that this band managed to find an audience in the mainstream media, apparently coming in with a slightly different variation of the modern metalcore scene. While nothing about this is ordinarily bad, it won them unnecessary praise. They did this by securing a niche of mainstream listeners whose minds were so malnourished by the saturation of cookie cutter metalcore that the slightest change of pace instantly became a hit. Some could argue the exact same thing occured when The Sword became a new \"pioneering\" force in the world of stoner/doom metal with \"The Age of Winters,\" despite being little more than a middle of the road album in that genre.\n\nIn the case of Mastodon, I have little use for their material, this including taking a few spins on \"Crack the Skye,\" which was money horribly wasted on my part. This band's other albums have come and gone in my collection, the only one I decided to keep was this one in \"Leviathan.\" This album manages to save itself from the gritty metalcore wasteland that this band has built themselves on by actually moving away from what made \"Remission\" as pleasing as surgery without anathesia. For one, Brann Dailor does tone it down a little on his carefree drumming extravaganza. He does manage to pull a straight beat out of his ass on occasion, but this is still the exception rather than the rule. \n\nAs for the vocals, they can be downright nerve racking at times though I'm not overly offended by whats going on here. This isn't a vocal driven album, which works all the more to Mastodon's advantage, giving way to some memorable riffs here and there leading to some memorable songs. Songs like \"I am Ahab,\" \"Aqua Dementia,\" and \"Iron Tusk\" are actually quite enjoyable, minus the nonsense behind the drumkit, and \"Megalodon\" throws in some halfway decent up-tempo work. Naturally, there are some songs here that are mostly forgettable to downright grating. \"Seabeast\" is a good example, which some have alluded to as a messy collage of meandering ideas and I'd have to completely agree. The other serious downer is \"Heart's Alive,\" a song I may be uncertified to actually comment on as I cannot sit through this song in its entirety. Its been said already, but it bears repeating that a band like Mastodon has absolutely no business writing long winded songs in an attempt to score an epic. \n\nWhile its mired by the usual flaws of this highly overrated band, \"Leviathan\" is still pretty enjoyable at times. I tended to like about half of these songs, and they remain the only songs I can really tolerate from this band. They've already put out two albums since this release, and both of them show no signs of recreating what enjoyable elements are present here. As far as I'm concerned, Mastodon have long worn out their welcome and have reduced themselves to a slightly more tolerable version of modern metalcore, and given the crap-tastic state of that scene, this isn't saying much. Anyone interested in this band either needs to hang up their hopes on these guys or look into this album, and this album alone. Simply forget the others exist, as this is only one worth your time. If you must get a hold of some Mastodon, I picked up \"Leviathan\" for $6 and thats about as high as one should go.\n",
        "\nThis is it? This is the Mastodon album everyone is tossing as the new masterpiece, this revolutionary modern classic? This is what everyone is excited about? Holy fuck, this sucks. Fuck, I can barely even listen to this tripe. How is everyone else so enamored with it? I honestly rarely hate albums as much as I do this one, because I actually went out of my way to praise Mastodon\u2019s last album Blood Mountain, which I still think is pretty good. But for them to put out this\u2026it\u2019s nothing less than completely inexcusable.\n\nThis is Crack the Skye, and it sucks so hard that I am inclined to believe it was made by a completely different band and accidentally released under the Mastodon name. I bet the record executives just forgot to check the tape; that must be it. This was a project by some no-name group of mountain-men from the Rockies; probably incestuous child-rapists without any kind of formal musical training. Heinous devil-men with blunt head trauma from falling down rocks and genitals swollen from having to pull out cactus spikes too often.\n\nBut alas. I cannot rest in realms of fantasy forever. Mastodon made this album, and it is my duty to verbally castrate them for it. Let the festivities begin:\n\nAlternative rock choruses, obnoxiously bland guitarwork and unnaturally nasal vocals, oh my! Mastodon have conjured up something here that is so far away from metal that it\u2019s hard to believe so many people are fooled into thinking this is some kind of a progression. Frankly, anyone who thinks this is any kind of a metal masterpiece or a progressive one is high. I do not want any of what these people are smoking, nor do I ever want to meet any of them in person.\n\nThe album kicks off with a song that nobody will ever remember after its end, one that is perhaps the most unmemorable song I have ever heard in my entire life. It is titled \u201cOblivion,\u201d and I have to wonder here, how is it possible to make this kind of progressive rock so god-awfully painful? It\u2019s some of the most wretchedly unpleasant music ever. The rumbling guitars and whiddly leads should be inoffensive, but they\u2019re played in such a condescending, self-conscious manner that they become\u2026vile, uneasy and despicable. The vocals don\u2019t help. They\u2019re whiny and obnoxious, and it\u2019s probably the worst clean vocal performance I\u2019ve ever heard in my life from a major band like this. Good god, he makes Ozzy sound like Dio! It\u2019s absolutely atrocious. Everything he sings is specifically tailored to be as painful as possible. Listen to that chorus on \u201cDivinations\u201d \u2013 have you ever in your life heard something that disgustingly snobbish? It is sung with this horrible self-righteousness, this terrible \u201cironic\u201d sort of arrogance; you can hear it in that sleazy sheen to his whiny rambling. It\u2019s like they\u2019re talking down to the listener for buying their album, for falling for it!\n\n\u201cQuintessence\u201d has a chorus that goes \u201cLet it go, let it go!\u201d Fitting, in the sense that the song is pretty much a six-minute extraction of the band\u2019s collective bowels. Completely disgusting. \u201cThe Czar\u201d is like Black Sabbath or Pink Floyd played by morons who don\u2019t understand the first thing about atmosphere and flow, and \u201cGhost of Karelia\u201d incorporates Thrash riffing as bland and out of place as it can possibly be. The title track is stupidly heavy, sounding the most like the Mastodon I know and love, but also not being anywhere near as compelling or interesting. \u201cThe Last Baron\u201d finishes with a whopping thirteen minutes of ridiculously boring, tepid droning and psychedelic vomit that would make Jimi Hendrix cry. It\u2019s a dreadful song without any kind of entertainment value. Dragging, overwrought and annoying, this is a surefire way to show people how NOT to end a music album.\n\nThis is just bad all around; there\u2019s nothing good about it. Sure, a few of the leads are pretty good, but they\u2019re not very memorable, and they don\u2019t rise above the sea of splooge that are the songs they\u2019re submerged in. I just don\u2019t get the entire idea behind this. The progressions are aimless; they do not seem to have any direction at all. The songs are ear-bleeding awful, being unbelievably pretentious in their delivery and also doubly not sounding any good. The music is just unpleasant all around, sounding dishonest, mean-spirited and just all around puerile, in both instrumentation and feel.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019ve figured out why everyone thinks this is so revolutionary. It\u2019s very clear to me now. Obviously those people who praised it for that reason were praising it because there was never before anything so universally fucking annoying! That must be it! Truly, Crack the Skye is a masterclass in horrendous songwriting and aimless attempts at progression. I\u2019ve never heard anything so wretched in tone and irritating in mood, so unbelievably boring and excruciating. It\u2019s as if it was a dream \u2013 nothing in reality could be so senselessly offensive to my common morality!\n\n\u2026yeah, Mastodon suck now. Too bad, I guess.\n",
        "\nOh My God...those were the only words I had when I first finished listening to this incredible album. I had never heard such a well recorded, well produced, and well performed album before this one. From the opening octaves in Oblivion, to the final breaths of The Last Baron, this ingenious Prog. Metal album has combined the best of 60's Prog. Rock and Metal into one killer album. It never once loses its intensity, never loses its beat and feel that each song presents, and each song actually seems to be able to lead into one another. Unlike Blood Mountain with its groove metal beats and playing style, each song is put in the perfect order based on the sounds it ends with, and that is part of the reason why this is so damn good of an album.\n\nThis isn't the Mastodon that made Blood Mountain, this is the new Mastodon. This is what Mastodon is made to do, this is their style and they have revolutionized both the style and the sound of Prog. It sounds richer, more complete in a way, especially with the amazing performance by Brann. All the great build ups he does that lead into the beats he performs are absolutely astounding, hes not just doing fill after fill, hes actually building the beats on top of the riffs the Brent and Bill are laying down. Along with all the auxiliary percussion pieces that he uses throughout the album (easiest to tell is of course the gong on Ghost of Karelia) it adds those little sounds that enhance the power of the sound on this album. You can hardly sometimes even notice they are there, but after listening a few times you begin to hear these things. All those little things really enhanced the sounds that they were producing.\n\nThe solos performed by Brent throughout the album are some of the best solos I've heard out of him. Each one fits so perfectly to both the chord progression and the overall feel of each song and in some cases the entire album itself. Especially how he is able to combine that 60\u2019s sound of his guitar with his metal style of playing, the result is a sound like no other. He is able to make excellent use of his great guitar playing and really making some great solos and also great riffs.\n\nThe lyrics are also a huge improvement compared to other albums. The story that they tell and the passages from certain texts the band cites, and just the overall story of the lyrics are very captivating. \n\nProg. Metal and Rock have never interested me as much but after listening to this album at least 4 or 5 times, I have come to enjoy it even more each time I listen. Each time you are able to find something that you didn't know was there before or a different way to hear each song. This album will be a classic amongst many metalheads for a long time to come.\n\nFavorite Tracks:\n(Oblivion, Divinations, The Czar, Crack The Skye, The Last Baron)\n",
        "\nThis is one of my favorites already, really. After I saw the video for Oblivion, which may be my favorite on here, I knew I was in store for something special, never listening to Mastodon because I passed them off as a simple death metal band in the past. I already had high expectations when I tracked Skye down, and it not only met those expectations with a full fist to the face, it bullied past them with such energy, balance and intensity that once the fifty minutes were done, my mind was thoroughly melted. Never before has there been such a perfectly performed progressive, groove metal album, defying Mastodon's previous heavier standpoint and replacing it with an even sturdier and just as penetrating sound as before, a change rarely pulled off well. In fact, I would dare say that there's no way to put this album to words truly.\n\nThe first, most obvious change (and at this point, over iterated) is the complete absence of death vocals, which is a welcome change in my opinion. The second is that Crack the Skye is much more progressive than their previous efforts, two songs reaching at least ten minutes and all of the rest but one reaching five. I believe the progressive styling of this album is very appropriate Mastodon's sound, more so than their more straightforward anthems of old. The writing of the album is extremely inspired, never feeling repetitive or familiar. There won't be a lot of \"that sounds like-\" moments, because Crack the Skye doesn't really sound like many other projects out there. One comparison that can be made is the occasional similarity to the music of Opeth, particularly the first 30 seconds of the title track, something tolerable because of the great talent of that group as well. CTS is largely it's own beast, though, being unique more often than not.\n\nFear not metal minions, as Crack the Skye still retains a certain level of heaviness, sometimes in great amounts, especially on the song Crack the Skye. The guitar and the drums on the album will be the heaviest elements on it, which are always rocking, and I don't need to mention how good of a drummer (and vocalist, as it turns out) Brann Dailor is, who felt especially inspired on this release since it dedicated to his sister who committed suicide at age 14. There is no ballad on here, so no need to worry about that. The entire album uses this kind of classic distorted tone, and even the musical direction can be described as 70's style, particularly Quintessence and The Last Baron. These are probably the softest, yet super-progressive, tracks on the album. Every song destroys on this record, and it might be the first time I've heard all of the songs nearly achieve the on the same level, and what a great level it is.\n\nOblivion is one of the best openers I've ever heard, an atmospheric journey without a misgiving. The catchiness of the whole song is surprising considering the dark and gloomy tone that dominates Crack the Skye in entirety. Divinations is overrated, and the worst on the album, but it's still great, of course. I guess what gets to me is it's simplistic nature and short duration. Quintessence is one of two songs on here that I believe to be underrated masterpieces, with a classic composition of old-school rock. The Czar is absolutely incredible, the best of the two lengthy ones on here. Split up into four awesome parts, The first is my favorite, with the most memorable rhythm of the album (\"don't stay, run away\"- stuck in my head every time.)\n\nGhost of Karelia is the perfect encore, with an awe-inspiring opening rhythm and overall dark feel. Good vocals on this one, too. Crack the Skye is fully inspired by Brann's sister, and the anger and pain there is represented perfectly as the heaviest song on the record. Very memorable verses. The Last Baron finally finishes this (literally) perfect album, and the singing comes fast into the song, which is kind of ironic considering that it is the longest at thirteen minutes. Sometimes I think it might be a bit overlong, but that certainly doesn't take away from this fine closer.\n\nGuitar solos are performed very adequately, the best of which I believe grace Oblivion and Divinations, but the leads and rhythms are the highlight in my opinion. They are always perfectly written and fit the other instruments well, a large piece in the overall puzzle of Crack the Skye\u2019s perfect sound. The production is the glue that keeps all the varying parts together and conformed, infusing every last element into a seamless quality that knows no planetary bounds. In the end, it all comes off as an intelligent deep-space sound with a substantial meaning underneath the layers of heaviness; nothing less than epic through and through.\n\nTwo words for this album are \u201cmature\u201d and \u201cinspired\u201c. The staggering atmospheric volume of the record is elevated with keyboard touches and occasional vintage synth rhythms in the background of a few songs, being especially effective on Crack the Skye and The Last Baron, adding yet another dimension to the infinite sound of the album. However, this won\u2019t be one of those albums that impairs your ability to enjoy it due to sheer technicality and complexity (see Twisted Into Form.) The songs never feel like there is too much going on at one time, but there is enough to raise it past a simplistic nature. \n\nThis will be an album that is listened to religiously, several times every day, unlike those all-too-many CDs collecting dust after just a couple of listens. And yet it is also not for everyone. With the sudden complete change of direction, it is likely that some people will hate Crack the Skye. My advice to all fans of the previous Mastodon albums is to precede with caution but also with an open mind, because it would be a shame to miss such an overall achievement due to pre-conceived doubts of the melodic progressivism performed here, which has taken place of the fast and screaming pace that held the majority over previous works. Just dim the lights and feel the flow of musicianship coming off in waves. Those who do won\u2019t be disappointed!\n\nCrack the Skye exploded out of the starting gate early upon it's release, backed by a couple of the greatest singles ever (Oblivion, Divinations), and it finished first by a mile. Crack the Skye will stand forever among my hierarchy of favorites, as I hope it will rank for you if you hear it. Any questions?\n",
        "\nWhy Mastodon receive the hype they do is really beyond me. I mean, I just don't get it. Every respectable metal magazine/website gave this album such high praise, almost to the point of, \"if you do not own this, you do not like metal\". So, after debating with myself for a time, I picked up a used copy at my local CD store. I sold it back to that very store about a week later.\n\n\"Leviathan\", as you may know, is a concept album based on the book \"Moby Dick\". This is a very cool concept, as I do not believe the subject matter has been tackled very much, if at all before. The downside is that such a concept does not work well at all with a band like Mastodon.\n\nThis album has been called progressive, but I have to disagree with this. I mean there are no doubt prog elements in this disc, but overall, it is not a progressive record. Anyone slapping the \"progressive metal\" label on this disc either heard one slightly prog passage and jumped to conclusions, or just plain did not have a clue. Come on guys, Coheed and Cambria are more prog than this. It takes more than a sloppily thrown together concept album and a song lasting over 8 minutes (\"Hearts Alive\") to be accurately described progressive.\n\nThe band members are undeniably capable at handling their instruments of choice, but don't really showcase the full potential they seem to have. Instead, they seem content sticking to a comfortable formula throughout. The guitars riffs just chug along for about three fourths of each song, and just when you think something cool is about to happen, it doesn't. You will also forget every one of the riffs as soon as you leave this disc. There are no real solos here, just slight change-ups from the main riff that add nothing to the songs. The drums are also pretty bland and the constant fills get on my nerves. Don't get me wrong, the drummer is easily the most talented one, but someone needs to tell him to cut back on the fills. Seriously, this guy is an attention whore behind the kit. This may work better in a live environment, but on a CD it becomes tiresome. The horrid vocals have no real melody or rhythm sense, and are placed on top of all this. Nearly all of the tracks die as soon as the vocals start up. Its like they threw the vocalist bare-ass into a bathtub filled with broken glass and hot sauce and put instrumentals behind all his screaming and grunting. Honestly, an album dealing with \"Moby Dick\" should have had some epic vocals, not this trash. The lyrics, if you can actually decipher them, are very unimaginative and do no justice to the subject matter. Just take the lyrics for \"I am Ahab\" for instance:\n\n\"There's magic in the water that attracts all men \nAcross hills and down streams \nThe turning of the tide \nOutlook \nFuture bright \nSelfish \nBeauty shines \nLight cloud rain drive on \n13 years to this day red planet aligned \nInto sight 60,000 years of light \nFascination with a mountain put to sea \nBuilt to slay and conquer \nAll with teeth of beasts\"\n\nYeah, they are pretty bad. Not that bad lyrics have stopped other albums from being great in the past, but put the mediocre lyrics on top of everything else and tell me it doesn't make the entire affair even worse.\n\nThe band's knowledge of song structure seems average at best, and that may be giving them too much credit. The songs start out strong, but never progress, and they become truly monotonous around the halfway point. The instrumentals, as previously mentioned, lack the variation needed to keep the songs interesting. That being said, my listening of \"Hearts Alive\" was the most bored I was in all of that particular year.\n\nThe mastodon was a big, hairy, elephant-like creature that went extinct during the ice age. They were not fast, aggressive, or very powerful. They looked tough, but really weren't, and they could not adapt to change. Perhaps the name this band chose for themselves is more accurate than they knew.\n\nMaybe they are better than I give them credit for, but if this is the case, they need to change their delivery. I can only judge them for what I have heard, and what I heard was plain boring. Not only was it boring, it was also cheesy, annoying, and forgettable. Not one thing on this record is groundbreaking in any way, no matter what you may have heard. The only reason I give this disc a 35 percent, is because this is easily the best Mastodon release to date, and the album cover is pretty badass.\n",
        "\n\"Leviathan\" has been described by many as a progressive metal record. This can be regarded as true if you look at it this way: Mastodon play their own music (which is heavy, very heavy) and bring into it influences that they draw from the 60's and 70's progressive rock. I want to give my opinion on this here point before I give you the reasons for the high rating because I've heard too many complaints already from progressive metal lovers who expected some Dream Theater kind of stuff from this band and didn't get it, then went and nagged about it. My point is that, in order to understand and (then eventually) love this album (and this band) one MUST have a solid 60's-70's prog-rock background or chances are he's going to feel misguided.\n\nBesides the fact that I don't really like modern progressive metal because I think there's just as much feeling in it as I hear when my dishwasher is on, and that's another difference, one BEYOND the music, that sets Mastodon apart from modern progressive bands. This guys put their hearts and guts into it, not only their brains and musical knowledge. And sure to me it's much more interesting to hear a drummer like Brann Dailor going totally fucking insane on his drum kit with the urge of an hungry wild animal looking for blood that those plastic progressive drummers (Mike Portnoy, anybody?) all they do is indulge in those boring odd-time signatures where you barely know when the riff starts and when it ends and then give you the usual fucking roll and a bang to let you know when to clap... But let's cut the crap and get down to the songs that rocked my socks that morning of June 2005.\n\nI had a chance to listen to \"Blood And Thunder\" a few weeks before I bought this Cd, watched the video on a compilation DVD I got from a magazine; I thought it was a silly funny video but the song was great! Ferocious up-tempo rock'n'roll with an Iron-Maiden-on-speed kind of break that put such a grin on my face\u2026 I got the weirdest looks even from my band-mates who were there with me. Everybody agreed it was an awesome song and a band definitely worth checking out. So, I went and bought the Cd, listened to it and got a sound thrashin'! After the first listen, I ended up thinking that \"Blood And Thunder\" was actually my least favourite song? I had to. This album grows like a monster, like the \"Seabeast\", from the depths of the fictional ocean it's set in, and grabs you by the balls and starts squeezin'. Throughout the triptych \"I am Ahab\"-\"Seabeast\"-\"Island\" melody and ferocity walk side by side. Talk about beauty and the beast, that's both.\n\nI don't exactly know why but when I first heard the opening riff to \"Iron Tusk\" I immediately thought about Opeth. Can anyone explain that to me? Another great song, a little too short maybe, but absolutely enjoyable. On this one, and especially on \"Megalodon\", Brann Dailor shines and rules like never before. Notable the weird, yet very tasty, country guitar break that introduces the second, more aggressive part of the song, courtesy of Brent Hinds' not forgotten past spent as leader of the rockabilly band Fiend Without A Face.\n\nAfter the relatively more relaxed and melody-driven episode Naked Burn, that can be seen as the calm before the storm, an unbelievably inspired guitar-drum double attack crashes on the listener like waves on a rocky shore in a stormy day introducing the amazing \"Aqua Dementia\". The uncontrollable stream of notes wrecks your ship, nothing you can do about it, as the song turns into an apocalyptic punk attack that kicks you far away from safe shores. As the chugging ending riff fades away, along with Scott Kelly's last abominable scream, your senses slowly come back... only to realize that you sank with the wreck of your ship and you're now up for one last claustrophobic nightmare. And you better be ready for this one, because it's going to be a long one...\n\n\"Hearts Alive\" contains the best 13 minutes of heavy music I\u2019ve heard since Neurosis\u2019 \"Through Silver In Blood\". It's the best way to wrap up an album as adventurous and mystical as this one and one of the most beautiful progressive metal (by now you should know what I mean by it) compositions ever. Daring, intuitive, free-spirited improvisation of both drums and guitars build up slowly but inevitably to the album's epitaph: a guitar solo worthy of Jimmy Page followed by a crushing, menacing riff that can only lead to a long, agonizing fall into the depths of the god sea.\n\nThat is the end of the line. If you've been a careful listener all hope to regain your senses must now be gone and all you can do is float away and let the dream-like melodies of \"Joseph Merrick\" carry your drifting remains to a safe place where silence reigns and it's all that matters. Yes, that's exactly the way I feel when I come upon something this great and it unfortunately ends: nothing can match what I've just heard, then I'd rather enjoy the silence.\n",
        "\nLive DVDs are rather tricky, they\u2019re either really good, or they completely suck. That is the case with this split DVD Unholy Alliance. Featuring Slayer\u2026and a bunch of talentless side acts like Lamb of God. And let me tell you, this is completely forgettable. \n\nSlayer sounds like a good band to see live don\u2019t they? Maybe not on this DVD but in general yes they would be. Slayer plays only ten songs ranging from good early ere to bad new ere. The worst part about their performance other than some of the songs would be the triggered drums. They just sound so clunky and you can tell that they\u2019re there. Tom\u2019s voice is also not the greatest, but that\u2019s mostly due to age, so you have to deal with that. The crowd is into their performance, every time the camera focuses on someone in the crowd they\u2019re usually flicking off the camera. Some of the songs are actually very good, \u201cAngle of Death\u201d sounds awesome, and \u201cChemical Warfare\u201d also another good one, probably the best song out of the bunch. The green smoke on the stage during the songs also is pretty cool. The new songs still suck even life however, \u201cCult\u201d is horrible, easily their worst song. I found it kind of weird how \u201cReign in Blood\u201d wasn\u2019t on here, after all that is probably the most famous Slayer song. Still Slayer gives the best performance on this DVD and they\u2019re the only reason why anyone should even get this. \n\nAfter the Slayer performance we have Mastodon, and they\u2019re the second best act on here, but that\u2019s only because their competition would include Lamb of God, Children of Bodom, and some act that you probably never heard of. I just don\u2019t get their style, like what exactly are they? They have a lot of groove in their bass, yet a lot of mindless guitar leads with their guitarist. Generally the songs are simple, with basic bass work and a simple rhythm, them some random solo comes out of nowhere. These guys in general are nothing more than a hard rock band with a few interesting solos here and there. The most interesting thing about their performance is that \u201cCapillarian Crest\u201d has an interesting audio clip in the beginning of the song. \n\nNow we come to what is the worst song on the DVD, and it\u2019s by no one other than Lamb of God. We all know these guys suck on album, but holy shit there are unlistenable live. They play \u201cVigil\u201d which I guess is their best song, but like all Lamb of God songs; it sounds like every other Lamb of God song. Basically groove chugging riffs, lame solo, breakdown, another chugging riff, and songs over. Halfway through the song he spends about a minute trying to get the crowd to form a circle pit, but what\u2019s annoying about it is that he is still using his annoying singing voice. Apparently this guys normal talking voice is the exact same as his singing voice. After hearing this song I\u2019m just glad their on stage for only five minutes.\n\nChildren of Bodom would be next, and I\u2019ve never really cared for these guys, mostly because they\u2019re so boring. \u201cAngles Don\u2019t Cry\u201d is dull, sounds uninspired as if they didn\u2019t want to perform it in the first place. Alexi still can\u2019t sing. He\u2019s basically doing hardcore shouts for the whole performance. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d starts off with chugging riffs and an annoying keyboard lead. Alexi still uses hardcore screams, only he\u2019s even more emotionless. \u201cIn Your Face\u201d is just one of those modern teenage oriented metalcore songs, basically the lyrical content of the song is \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck motherfucker\u201d over and over in the chorus. Just like Lamb of God, they\u2019re forgettable.\n\nThe final band is Thine Eyes Bleed, who I never heard of until I heard them on this DVD. I can see why now too, they\u2019re basically modern melodic death, so they got some metalcore influences. Worst thing about their performance is hands down their vocalist. Basically he is your typical monotone singer that consists of hardcore shouts, and ear bleeding shrieks, much like the vocals from Blythe on Lamb of God. Slower groove passages, a weak solo, and ends with a chugging breakdown is how this song goes. Drumming is also annoying due to the fact that the drums are triggered. Triggers are annoying especially when there used with nonstop blast beats. This is just a terrible way to end the DVD, although considering how almost every performance is mediocre to horrible; I guess it makes sense to end it this way. \n\nSo this DVD has gotten a dubbed production job. You know the one where the songs have that semi live feel to them. Every performance has triggered drums; everything has been worked on to sound sharper, crisper guitar sound, more audible bass and what not. But that takes away the whole live feeling of it all. There\u2019s also no intermission or switch to the next song. After every song the screen cuts black, then the band name and the name of the song they will play appears, then it kicks right into the song, there\u2019s literally no interaction with the crowd whatsoever except for the quick Lamb of God bit. \n\nWell considering how only Slayer is worth hearing, and considering how only about half their songs are also worth hearing, this is just a really bad DVD. The guest acts\u2026well all suck really, playing generic metalcore songs at best by all of them. Slayer is the highlight of this album and only six of their ten songs are worth hearing. So if you haven\u2019t figured it out by now you can completely ignore this DVD.\n",
        "\nMastodon have always been strange territory for me. Their mythical lyrical subject matter is deeply appealing to me, however I\u2019ve always found something not to like about their music. Their early releases usually had a few songs that were pounding enough to get my head moving, but those moments weren\u2019t frequent enough to hold my interest. Unfortunately, their sound has gone from bad to worse since the groove-laden wankfest that was Blood Mountain. Crack The Skye shows a brand spanking new Mastodon, one that has abandoned nearly all traces of their metal past. Doesn\u2019t that sound interesting and ambitious? Read on.\n\nI am always willing to welcome changes and reinventions within bands, but only when it is well planned out. It surprises me how widely accepted this massive shift in Mastodon\u2019s music has been among fans, because it really doesn\u2019t grasp me. That said, I commend them for not making Blood Mountain Part Two, because that certainly wouldn\u2019t be interesting. The first big change one would likely note upon listening to Crack The Skye is that this is definitely more melodic than previous Mastodon albums. Then again, I don\u2019t feel \u2018melodic\u2019 is the right word, because what\u2019s melodic music without catchy melodies? I would say that words such as \u2018softer\u2019 or \u2018pussier\u2019 would be more accurate.\n\nOblivion kicks things off with a slow, gloomy intro, only to make way for the most irritating vocals in recent memory. These are a plague throughout the album, and even get worse on songs such as Quintessence. Despite the lousy vocal performance, the chorus of Oblivion manages to be the catchiest moment on the album, making it a highlight, despite the half assed, afterthought of a guitar solo. I don\u2019t know why this wasn\u2019t the lead single because I would definitely say it\u2019s better than Divinations. The Czar is the second longest song on the album, clocking in at just under eleven minutes, but mostly sounds like a song your mother used to play quietly at the side of your bed to help you fall asleep. The title track is the only other song worth mentioning, because it\u2019s the closest thing you\u2019ll find here that resembles extreme metal (a genre of music that didn\u2019t used to be so foreign to Mastodon). The heaviness in this track is courtesy of Scott Kelly (Neurosis) who does a fine job of injecting some variety into the mundane field of vocals.\n\nAs far as instrumentation goes, I found a lot to be desired. The guitar work, as a whole, is what I would call sub-par for a Mastodon release. None of the riffs ingrained themselves in my mind, like the way March of the Fire Ants did the first time I heard it, and the solos mostly seem awkward. I think I\u2019ve talked enough about vocals for you to get an idea of my opinion on them. I\u2019ll just add that I miss the harsh screaming of Remission, combined with the old, ultra heavy/sludgy riffs.\n\nI think it\u2019s a shame that Mastodon chose to tread this safe path of unheavy mediocrity, because I always saw potential in this band. I think I\u2019ll stop checking out new releases from Mastodon because I seem to just get more and more disappointed with them.\n",
        "\nMuch like how Stratovarius made me rethink my take on them this year with the release of \"Polaris,\" Mastodon's most recent studio effort has given me a new level of appreciation for the once sludgy prog group. I had originally tried getting into them by means of 2004's \"Leviathan\" but I was put off by inconsistent songwriting that ultimately didn't live up to the album's extrme level of hype (though I really enjoyed \"Blood And Thunder\") and never had much interest in checking out the next few efforts that soon followed. Ironically enough, the hype that came with this album was what got me interested and I soon bought a copy after hearing one of the songs online before the big release. I can safely that there was a good degree of truth in the hype this time around...\n\nMusically, this may be the band's most ambitious effort to date. For the most part, the heavier aspects and harsher vocals of the band's past have been discarded in favor of more melodic guitar playing and a cleaner vocal performance. I'm still really surprised by how unified the vocals sound on this album in comparison to past albums and can agree with the reviewer who described the singing as like a cross between Peter Gabriel and Ozzy Osbourne. It really helps in defining the band's individual sound and may be helpful in getting the band a wider fanbase. However, there are still a few harsher moments to be found and Neurosis vocalist Scott Kelly lends some particularly angry vocals on the title track. Seriously, this guy has appeared on three albums in a row, why the hell isn't he credited as a band member yet?\n\nAlthough there are only seven songs, this may also be the band's most complex effort in terms of the songwriting and overall structure. A good variety is present and the songs range from longer epics (\"The Czar,\" \"The Last Baron\"), heavy rockers (\"Quintessence,\" \"Crack the Skye\"), and even a few more accessible upbeat tracks (\"Oblivion,\" \"Divinations\"). I think \"The Czar\" may be my favorite song on the album and is made interesting by its spacy Pink Floydesque beginning, infectiously echoing vocals, and a cool faster sequence in the middle of the song. The title track is also memorable for its strong heavy/melodic contrasts and I must also give props to \"Oblivion\" and \"Divinations\" for getting me into this album in the first place...\n\nLike \"Leviathan\" and \"Blood Mountain\" before it, this release is a concept album and has a trippy overall theme. I can't make much out of the story on a line-to-line basis but it has some references relating to wormholes, soul transfers, Rasputin, and the Devil himself. The title track was also apparently inspired by the suicide of a band member's sister and features a few powerful lines (\"Please tell Lucifer he can't have this one/Her spirit's too strong/It's written all over your face/I can see the pain/You can make it all go away\").\n\nI really hate to make this kind of comparison, but this is the album that Trivium should've made with \"The Crusade.\" It shows a band naturally moving to a more mature songwriting and executing a new sound with class and honesty. I can see a few idiotic fans thinking of this transition as Mastodon \"selling out\" or \"going soft,\" but that is hardly the case. Definitely worth checking out and possibly one of the top records of 2009. Hell, it's made me think about giving the band's older albums another chance...\n\nPros:\n1) A successful new sound\n2) Excellently focused vocals and cool riffs\n3) Great songwriting and varied songs\n4) Interesting lyrical themes\n\nCons:\n1) Some fans may not like the more melodic sound\n2) The drums don't stand out as much as on \"Leviathan\"\n\nMy Current Favorites:\n\"Oblivion,\" \"Divinations,\" \"Quintessence,\" \"The Czar,\" and \"Crack the Skye\"\n",
        "\nStarting off, Mastodon are progressive in a way that they are expanding on their own sludge and groove boundaries with new and interesting guitar and lyrical ideas. Not in a super crazy instrumental way (well, except for Brann Dailor, holy shit). \n\nAnyways, the album starts off with the utterly fantastic Blood and Thunder. A monster that gets the Moby Dick based epic on its way with a super distorted, sludgy guitar tone and a small collective of well placed riffs, harmonies, and lead lines. \n\nThe groove is apparent, supplied by Troy's monolithic bass sound and vocals, and Brann's ability to make drum patterns out of fills and insane cymbal work, a la Neil Peart. The guitars have a very strange approach. Mixing in groove/thrash riffing apparent on most of the songs, sludgy power chord dirges, and semi-clean almost banjo-sounding licks the guitars are formidable in versatility and heaviness. The harmonies range from basic Maiden-style to slightly grungier, darker harmonies.\n\nThe songs are all short, minus the somewhat disappointing epic Hearts Alive, and are all killer, no filler. Seriously, every song on this album has its own groove and crunch, its own soul. Especially the highlight of the album, Megalodon, where the song stays in a standard formula, then switches to pseudo-thrash riff with those aforementioned banjo-licks separating them. Then the song finishes off with a finishing blow that was too quick, and could've been longer.\n\nThe guitar duo of Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher are really a sight to behold (or a listen?). Mixing sludge metal, hardcore, groove metal and southern rock is not a super easy task, and they definitely perform that combination well. As stated before, the album's guitar work generates a riff-filled energy reminiscent of thrash metal and hardcore punk, but at the same time has a groove leaning in the actual sense of the riffs. The leads are spectacular, really well executed.\n\nTroy Sanders is a great bassist as well. He plays a finger picked bass through a mountain of distortion, giving the album that sludgy feel, and his playing is very off-the-wall and spastic. His playing can switch between playing counterpoint melodies with the guitars and creating a crazy atmosphere of hate and energy, or he can play simple root notes or power chords and create some kind of infernal racket. \n\nAlso said before, Brann Dailor is a wicked drummer. Sounding like some weird mix of Buddy Rich, Neil Peart, and Eric Brecht, he constructs most of his patterns out of intense jazzy fills and crazy metal drum licks. He definitely earns his internet nickname, The Octopus. Just listen to Megalodon. \n\nThe vocals, or vocal attack, of Mastodon comes from all four members. While Bill and Brann do very little on this album, they do show up occasionally on the clean sections (Brann) and the layered yell sections (Bill). Troy is the main vocalist, and is the main vocalist for almost all of Mastodon's albums (except for the bad Blood Mountain and the mediocre Cracking the Skye), and his vocals consist of harsh yells and very deep somewhat melodic singing. Brent's vocals are usually cleaner than Troy's and are a kind of screech/yell combination that is decently effective when used in moderation.\n\nThe production of this album is very good, with the stringed instruments leading the pack, the drums and vocals close behind, and then a slight hint of reverb on the drums for a bit more kick. Everything fills in the spectrum very well, all the instruments and the vocalists do a good job of filling what could've been an empty sounding album, like Mastodon's later releases (Blood Mountain, at least).\n\nThe songwriting is top notch. As I said in the song section, all the songs have their own feel and kick to them, whether it be a slightly mellow and southern vibe, or a heavy disjointed and angry sound that kicks your teeth in, it's all good. That's something else, this band knows when to write a ball-stomping riff that makes you mosh everytime you hear it, and then write a melodic line that is just sleazy and dirty enough to catch southern rock fans and make them join in on the fun.\n\nThe sole gripes I have with this album are that some of the better songs (Megalodon, Naked Burn, I Am Ahab) are too short, and that the worst song on the album is 13 minutes long and isn't very interesting. Also, that Brent Hinds needs to shut up and let Scott Kelly do occasional shrieks like at the beginning of Aqua Dementia, and for him to play some solos (which I admit he is very good at). \n\nAll in all, this album is a combination of great aspects in metal music; fun, heavy, grimy, sludgy, progressive, and meaty. When I say fun, I mean that everything sounds energetic and not like Venom or Motorhead where it\u2019s all about rockin' out, as well. \n\nBuy this album if you love cool, interesting music that puts a new and down home twist on hard-hitting progressive metal.\n",
        "\nMastodon \u2013 a name that when uttered, either makes you think of Power Rangers, a dinosaur or a heavy as hell metal band. They were always known for their balls-to-the-wall metal, as shown in past releases like Remission and Leviathan. Here, they continue what they began on Blood Mountain, which was a great experimentation period. I fully believe that with this release, they have reinvented and out-done their selves on an amazing scale. Never fear, the crunching riffs and drum rolls are still here \u2013 just in a slightly different way. This album is different, though, in the sense that it\u2019s meant to be a \u2018grower\u2019, not a \u2018holy shit\u2019 at first glance album, like Mastodon\u2019s previous releases.\n\nBeginning the album is Oblivion \u2013 which at first glance shows you the album will not be like the past two releases. There is not a fast and quick drum intro, nor is there a riff repeated over and over. It\u2019s the simple strumming of a guitar, down all the strings and into a very beefy riff. Then, the song kicks into the more traditional Mastodon style, with some crazy drums here and there and some great riffing going on and a tremendous solo in the middle. The vocalists are a pair here, and they each show off their talents greatly with clean and harsh vocals. This trend is continued on the next track, Divinations. This song is more reminiscent of Blood Mountain/Leviathan: hardcore, packed with a fast tempo and a galloping riff and harsh vocals to boot. A great rocker and definitely one to headbang to. \n\nNow, things start to get a tad strange for Mastodon. They jump into Quintessence, which feels like a strange track. It\u2019s got the riff, it\u2019s got the drums, yet they\u2019re not at an extreme tempo. They\u2019re more relaxed. The chorus of the song is fast, yet that\u2019s about the only part of the song that is. The rest is a relaxed, mellow feeling song. It\u2019s a great middle track. The Czar just continues to the madness of this release. A ten minute song? The first of two? In MY Mastodon? Fret not, folks, it\u2019s done well. It opens with an organ playing some haunting tune. It then continues with a slow bass line followed by some very clean singing and the guitar chimes in and you\u2019re off. Cue complex time changes and amazing riffs and an amazing ending solo to definitely write home about. The song sounds very much like classic progressive rock and Mastodon do it very well. The finale is just a soft piano, which is very strange for a Mastodon song. The next two songs are similar, but that does not make them bad in the least. Ghost of Karelia and Crack the Skye are two straight-forward rockers. The drumming from Blood Mountain is back and in full force in Ghost of Karelia and the experimentation of The Czar is in Crack the Skye. Ghost is a song that is centered around vocals, and the vocals are done very well. It\u2019s one of Mastodon\u2019s better vocal-centered songs, with the guitars and drums matching the vocal parts very well. Crack the Skye is also done very well with harsh and clean vocals, but the keyboards return there and a fancy guitar solo is thrown into boot.\n\nFinally, we come to the finale of the album, and (in my personal opinion), the greatest Mastodon song ever recorded: The Last Baron. Beginning with a faced paced acoustic guitar and clean vocals which send shivers down the spine, you know you\u2019re in for a treat. The first few minutes are classic Mastodon \u2013 layered guitars, beasty riffs and vocals. After about the three minute mark, the song goes silent \u2013 and slowly fades in a guitar. Once it fades in, you know the ride has just begun. The crazy and amazing instrumental sets in (with vocals coming in here and there), which is not unlike Dream Theater (good DT, not bad). Towards the six minute part of the song, there is a breakdown which sounds vaguely like the one featured in Leviathan\u2019s Megalodon. The end of the breakdown gives a nod to Rush\u2019s YYZ, which is always a great tidbit. The song then ends with a repetition of the beginning and fades into silence.\n\nI fully believe Mastodon have outdone themselves with this release. They have fully matured from a band who simply tried to play as fast as possible and tried to make great songs (which they did) into a band with structure, with purpose, and feeling. At first glance, people may think that Mastodon have lost all of their past metal-ness, however this is not true. If you are willing to let this album grow on you (which I said you should, stated above), then you will find a rewarding experience and in my personal opinion, the greatest Mastodon album yet.\n",
        "\nWhat is this? No sludgy harsh vocals to be found? More progression? Extreme consistency? I tip my hat to Mastodon for once again for being the only band that I can expect absolute perfection and originality from that didn't form in the 60's, 70's, 80's, or early 90's. In a time where metal is dominated by shit core and/or bands showing off 'technical skill' without any real interesting ideas at all, Mastodon prevails. From the jaw-dropping cover artwork of Crack the Skye to Dallor's mind-blowing lyrics and drumming skills, this album will leave any human being with a soul moved by the pure emotion and beauty (as well as intensity) that the band has unleashed on us with their most recent release.\n\nCrack the Sky flows so well without being one song it is almost unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, every track has it's own feel; like the brutal darkness of \"Crack the Skye,\" the majestic feel of \"Quintessence,\" and the sheer epic mastery of \"The Last Baron.\" What I mean is, absolutely no song feels out of place on the album, and each track flows perfectly into the next. It seems that this band is evolving much more into a classic/progressive metal band than a groove/sludge metal band. The song structures are much more complex (especially on The Czar), their music is a lot less in your face and more interested in rewarding you with patience, guitar solos/keyboarding is much more present, and there is an obvious change in vocal styles.\n\nSpeaking of their change in vocal styles, diehard fans of Leviathan and Remission who were disappointed with Blood Mountain toning down the brutality will most likely despise this album. There are almost no harsh vocals to be found, and it is instead replaced with a style not unlike a combination of Ozzy Osbourne and Peter Gabriel. Sound strange? Well, truth be told it threw me off at first, as well. But they don't take long to get used to and once you let this new style sink in, it is addicting to listen to.\n\nAs mentioned before, it is frightening how amazing Dallor is at drumming. Just compare his drumming in Blood Mountain to this. He has perfected two completely different styles within the time span of three years in between these releases. It would just be unjust to not recognize Dallor as one of the best new drummers in metal today. Comparing Leviathan to Crack the Sky, I was also very impressed with the spectacular improvement of Hinds and Kellihers guitar work, which is especially apparent in the middle section of \"The Last Baron,\" my personal favorite song. That is another thing: every song on this album seems to get better. \"Oblivion\" is the worst and \"The Last Baron\" is the best. And \"Oblivion\" is a fucking awesome song! It just keeps your intrigue because you know that the next song is going to be even better than the last. How many albums can you say that about?\n\nIf you don't like musical originality or talent in your metal and just want brutality, than I don't suggest this album. If you do enjoy musical originality and talent in your metal, then need I say more? This is fucking Mastodon and they refuse to let you down! Now do yourself a favor and get a copy of Crack the Skye as soon as possible.\n\nHighlights: Everything is great, but \"The Last Baron\" and \"The Czar\"\n",
        "\nMy first Mastodon review was for their first demo with Eric Saner on vocals. Aggressive, young and crushing, the demo showed little of what Mastodon would be creating 9 years later. It was an example of a group of young men getting together and deciding to destroy everything in their path. Nary a clean vocal styling was found on it and for the most part, it seemed they screamed random things out of pure anger. Remission was not that different from the demo with it's pulverizing riffs and hoarse growling. Leviathan mixed it up a little bit and showed a small glimpse of the future with the epic length \"Hearts Alive.\" Blood Mountain arrives and the clean singing is much more apparent. I don't know if it had to do with Warner Bros. signing them or if it was an example of Mastodon growing as musicians. 3 years later, we arrive at Crack the Skye. What we have here is something that resembles little of their first two and shares not that much with the prior.\n\nWith only seven songs on the record, you might be lead to think it's short. At 48 minutes, it's long enough to be musically filling and short enough so you don't get bored with an hour+ long concept. Singing has improved leaps and bounds compared to their past efforts. Singing almost entirely cleanly, the only growls appear in the title track, handled by frequent Mastodon guest Scott Kelly, and somewhat in the previously mentioned \"Divinations.\" Drummer Brann Dailor shares lead vocals in \"Oblivion\" and he actually seems to outshine Sanders and Hinds. Hopefully the guy stands behind the mic more often because the vocals fit the music wonderfully. \n\nSome may be disappointed by the fact that only one song, \"Divinations,\" resembles Mastodon of years past with it's more aggressive approach. Not to say the album is light, it's plenty heavy, but not in the way \"Blood and Thunder\" was. Mastodon was never big on solos so they don't populate the songs as much as other prog bands, but ones that do serve the songs well. Mentioned earlier, \"Hearts Alive\" was a 13 minute long journey that stood out next to the shorter songs on Leviathan. Here we come across two songs that break the 10 minute mark. \"The Czar\" and \"The Last Baron\" are two awesome songs that need to be listened to. My favorite on here has to be the title track. Shared vocals between Kelly and Sanders, it has a heavy Neurosis tinge to it during the verses. The other songs on here are just as strong and deserve your full attention.\n\nWith this album, Mastodon has hit their zenith. Different and challenging, this album is a masterpiece that needs to be heard by any fan of good music,never mind good metal. Wearing their influences on their sleeve, Mastodon have released the album of their career and hopefully they can keep up it up. They've said they plan on continuing in this direction so hopefully it pays off for them. Buy, don't download, this album, put it in the best stereo you can find, find a chair, sit back and open your ears for 48 minutes of some of the best music to come along this decade.\n",
        "\nMastodon is currently one of the biggest names in metal. While some dislike their sludgy brand of metal, this metalhead really enjoys their style. After recently purchasing their latest, at least at the time of this writing, title Crack the Skye, I decided to go back to their roots and dig out their very first demo. While this particular album has been released under a few different titles with a few alterations intracklisting , there is a very noticeable difference here: the vocals. Unlike all of their material released afterwards, this has vocalist Eric Saner handling all singing duties. One of the chief complaints I tend to find directed towards Mastodon is their lack of a distinctive singer. While this obviously isn't 100% fail-safe, I point to this demo as proof that complaint is a somewhat empty one.\n\nIf you need a point of comparison, purchase Call of the Mastodon. That and this demo are more or less the same album, but with different vocalists. With Saner as vocalist, the songs are weighed down by Saner's somewhat generic metalcore voice. He doesn't alter his tone much other than raising and lowering it a rare few times. Very undecipherable and lacking any real punch. CotM , while not perfect by any means, has a noticeable improvement in this area. Brent Hinds and Troy Sanders share singing duties and for the better. While their screaming does get monotonous at times, there are clean vocals popping up and the screams themselves are much better than Sanders though are about the same in the \"what are they saying?\" scale. The duel aspect does add another layer to the music giving it a feeling of franticness while Saner's plain screams dull the music as a whole. Hinds/Sanders combine to make the music much more interesting to listen to, especially in later records when they become more identifiable.\n\nInstrumentally, the album is a fun listen. Guitars are thick and heavy and often are changing riffs at any given time. Solos, however, are non-existent for the most part though leads appear here and there albeit very rarely. Bass thumps along not adding much to the music, but it's pretty hearable which is a a step above many other bands in metal. Drumming, however, is another contendable point among listeners. Brann Dailor is an extremely technical percussionist and, is in my opinion, another aspect of the band that is irreplaceable. A lot of listeners find his style distracting however, as it seems almost too frantic at times which is something I do agree with.\n\nProduction-wise, the album is amazingly clear for a demo. I don't believe much, if anything, besides the vocals were re-recorded for any release in which these songs appear on to give you an idea of it's clarity. Everything is heard loud and clear. For the album as a whole, I cannot recommend it due to it's song appearing in superior forms on other releases. Download it as a history lesson and decide for yourself if the band could have truly progressed to where they are today with a dedicated singer like Saner.\n",
        "\nMastodon has always been a band who offers something different each time they release an album. They began with a heavy angry sounding album, than slowly became less edgy while they increased their technical ability. This has been received as a mixed bag. Mastodon has lost a lot of fans because of the fact that they have traded edginess for more complex material. While others, myself included embrace this new sound and wonder what Mastodon will do next.\n\nI just purchased \u201cCrack the Skye\u201d today and I asked a friend to put it on in the car on the ride home. I asked what he thought of it and he gave me this response \u201cIt\u2019s like Pink Floyd, but metal!\u201d I find this to be a great way to explain Mastodon to someone who has never heard them because they take elements from psychedelic rock, stoner rock, and heavy metal to create an awe inspiring listening experience that becomes more complex as each album is released.\n\nNow that I\u2019m finished my little blurb it\u2019s onto the album itself. It opens exactly the way I was hoping with a memorable riff, course that stays in your head for days, and some great vocal variation. This continues throughout the album from one song to the next. Even though one song is technically four parts they seem to flow together beautifully and the transition is so smooth that you hardly notice a change at all. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t like it when songs appear to run together, but this one of the few times in which this works and works effectively. \n\nThe use of varied instrumentation, technical riffing, varied drum tempos, and variations on the same clean vocal style make this album a true gem of 2009. Even though some fans may think Mastodon has lost their edge they still put out excellent music and I would sure trade edge for technical ability any day. Also, as my album review suggests the best way to describe this album is that it is truly thinking man\u2019s metal.\n",
        "\nSome people I know were sort of surprised (and some other very disappointed) by Mastodon's choice of leaving their old prog-metal sound behind in favor of a more unconventional ambient-prog-psychedelic hard-rock sound. Some of 'em were either expecting a new \"Blood Mountain\" or a \"Leviathan Pt.II\", thinking perhaps that Mastodon couldn't get any better than that. Wrong. \n\nThe highest point a musician can reach, in my opinion, is being able to keep your art alive and make amazing music every time while not being bound to genre restrictions of any sort. For a good musician, being tied to one genre is like refusing to evolve and denying your skills to evolve. It's like living your life in fear of what's outside your own house and never going out for a walk. In many interviews that came out prior to the release of \"Crack The Skye\", the Mastodon's guys had been talking about their new album being much more 70's-prog-rock-oriented than its predecessors and how they wanted it to sound like something off the old Canterbury scene. Well, either you were prepared or not for the result, I think they fully achieved their goal. \"Crack The Skye\" sounds exactly like something that Genesis, or King Crimson, or Pink Floyd would have pulled off if they decided to make a metal album. It's like a Mastodon album played by one of those bands. Or the other way around.\n\nEven though the album starts with a slightly down-tuned guitar arpeggio that could have easily introduced a Machine Head song, as soon as the first sung verse from the first song, \"Oblivion\", kicks in you notice how mature these guys have become and how much further they dared to push their art. Brann Dailor (the drummer) sings the verses, and it stupefied me how cool his voice sounds and how good a singer he really is. Then Troy Sanders hops in with the bridge and Brent Hinds follows singing the chorus. Now, this song is the perfect example of where this album goes, of what Mastodon wants to convey, lyrically and vocally speaking. A new, uncharted territory unfolds before your eyes, the greatness of the sounds of the guitars and drums, the somehow AliceInChain-esque feel that permeates the entire composition give you the chance to forget about what you were expecting this album to be, letting you immediately recognize that this is Mastodon, but at the same time giving you a clear, undeniable warning that this might take you where you weren't expecting to be taken. \n\nSo, fasten your seatbelts, the first and last real rocker of the album, the single \"Divinations\" (with the silly video related to it) speeds things up for about 4 minutes only to give way to the \"real\" album. From track 3, \"Quintessence\", the band stops being the Mastodon you used to know and does it for good. Here the experimentation begins. This song, the haunting 4-part suite \"The Czar\", the Metallica-influenced \"Ghost Of Karelia\", the awe-inspiring, ground-cracking title track (growled in almost its entirety and with the usual fiery force by Neurosis' Scott Kelly) are all absolutely great, overwhelming. They all stick in your mind leaving you asking for more, without necessarily having any hooks or anything. Actually, the lack of hooks and catchy stuff in this album is its strongest point in favour, since this makes its musical and lyrical concept flow much better than in their previous albums and, in the end, after a couple of listens, it will stick in your head (that is, if your head is prepared to receive it) as a whole great piece of amazing music, and not merely a collection of good songs. Every song flows into the next like a canoe trip on an angry river going through rapids all the time.\n\nAnd still, the best has yet to come! Because, I think, Mastodon were smart enough to leave their best song as the last track on the album. \"The Last Baron\" has everything you can ask to a progressive metal song: an eerie atmosphere that never lets go of you, crafted masterfully by the whole band through echoes of psychedelia-evoking arpeggios and beautiful singing opposed to more intricated and tangled-up proggy parts, until the song's climax explodes, in a Rush-y kind of way, in a frantic flurry of notes and blows that chase each other with no breaks or breath-catching pauses. \n\nA real masterpiece, in my opinion, this song is destined to become a standard, something to look up to in progressive music. Whenever you're wondering what real progressive music should sound like, you should listen to this. Just like this whole album is a complete fucking monster, something that will remind us all, for years to come, that in the years 2000's metal bands can still write real music, real songs and give their audiences real emotions like Metallica used to do back when they were good. So I can say here, now, subjectively and with the utmost confidence that this album is destined to be the best metal album for a looooong time to come, and it will have deserve it because it's a MASTERPIECE from start to finish. It's that simple.\n",
        "\nI've been listening to Mastodon since I heard they toured with High on Fire. It started off as an ok-band. While their first material didn't came off as something that'd blow your mind, something was to be noted. The quality of their releases seemed better each time. With each published song, Mastodon's space in the rock n roll world seemed more and more undeniable.\n\nWith this album they have consolidated themselves. Their incredible rhythm section only continues to develop from their previous releases and set up the pace for the melodies to take hold in a strong and decisive fashion. Their progressive intention is also to be noted, as they are able to produce songs that not only are technical, but not tough on the old eardrums. Both the leading and rythm guitars are more in harmony, with riffs that don't deviate outside their still in development style. The soloing also is worked to a level that fits much, much better to a band that receives influences from sludge, groove, stoner metal, among others. It sounds coherent, intelligent and powerful.\n\nThis band is to be carefully listened and considered to be among the new standarts of contemporary metal. I admire the effort to make progressive metal and yet not fall in the \"mathemathical\" category. The evolution and experience adquired since Blood Mountain is significant if not more. It does slow the tempo just a bit, but it does contribute to form them much more, and gives them a voice that's coming to be more and more unique.\n\nIt is incredibly satisfying to listen (in the record, of course) that a band that promises so much to be fulfulling themselves, taking their time and carefully thinking before taking a single step into the recording studio. An album not to be missed.\n",
        "\nI was expecting so much this Mastodon's effort that being disappointed would be a scenario to consider. Thanks to Odin, that didn't happen.\n\n'Crack the Skye' proves that Mastodon is not a band committed to a single metal style, not at all. 'Blood Mountain' took a more experimental road when compared to 'Leviathan', for example, and this record keeps that innovative path. We can find influences from thrash to Genesis' prog rock. Is it difficult to harmonize so much variety? Yes. But for Mastodon that's piece of cake. \n\nAlthough the innovation that Mastodon always pretend to create in their records, that doesn't mean that their particular sound is lost. No, Bill and Brent deliver one more time awesome riffs and solos with their singular guitar tune. Brann, of course, shows that he's one of the best drummer nowadays, with his accurate, fast and 'clean' playing style. Simple astonishing. Brann is the band's heart, without him they could not do their time variation, like 'The Czar' shows. In one word: talent.\n\n'Crack the Skye', also, is an album that gets better and better due to the tracklist order. 'Oblivion' is the weakest song with the final three 'Ghost of Karelia', 'Crack the Skye' and 'The Last Baron' being the best. There is some kind of progressive geniality towards the end that keep the listener focused and stick to the record till the last minute. That's a great positive point, making the album everything but boring, although the duration of some tracks. And progressive is perhaps the word that defines best this effort. \n\nSome will complain about the mid-paced tempo of CTS, which is probably their slowest record. Only 'Divinations' and some parts of 'Quintessence' come close to high speed tracks like 'Blood and Thunder' or 'Megalodon'. But that doesn't mean that the intensity is minor. Completely wrong in my point of view. The lack of speed in some moments is very well filled by a complex structure/composition, where the 3 B's talent is shown, like I said previously. We can find solos which can makes us think about Opeth ('The Czar') and riffs that create a glacial background capable of throwing us to scenarios like the old Russia or to some kind of stratospheric landscapes. The most suitable example is 'The Last Baron', one of the 'Crack the Skye' highlights, with some Cynic and King Crimson reminiscence, with an excellent work of Troy here too. \n\nOther change in comparison to other Mastodon's works is the vocals. I don't pay much attention to this factor. They are not so harsh like before, the cleaning registry appears more frequently. In this area, I only have to mention Scott Kelly. Fuck, he delivers a powerful contribution with his growling vocals on the self titled track...! The lyrical themes, like they said, are full of metaphors for their own personal shit, so that doesn't deserve attention either.\n\nOne final tip: This record deserves to be listened a thousand times because there is so much to find out.\n",
        "\nMastodon is and has always been a very progressive band. They've never sounded like anyone else (exept Baroness, who ripped them the fuck off), and with 2009's \"Crack The Skye\" they prove that they have no intention of changing this trend.\n\nThis album is somewhat similar to 2006's \"Blood Mountain\", which was a mixture of sludge, hardcore, thrash, and progressive metal. However, the sound here is a mixture of experimental rock music (in the vein of say, The Mars Volta) with progressive metal. Imagine \"Colors\" by Between The Buried & Me, exept with less solos and no growled vocals whatsoever playing at the same time as The Mars Volta's \"Frances The Mute\". There is very little sludge to be heard here, while it has not been abondoned. The best example of this could be seen in one of the album's finest tracks, \"The Czar\", which somehow manages to mix the band's older, very heavy sound, with extreme experimentalism, dabbling in genre's like ambient and jazz. We also have \"Quintessance\", which sounds very psychadelic in some places. \n\nThe band never abandons their trademark progressive metal sound, however. All the songs on the album get heavy at some point, proving that the band has not forgotten who they previously were. \"Divinations\" is the only song on the album that is entirly metal, without any softer moments (exept the somewhat humerous banjo intro). \n\nAnother difference to be noted is the vocals. There is almost NO screaming on this cd. The only songs to have screaming are \"Divinations\" and \"Crack The Skye\", the latter of which features vocals by Scott Kelly (Neurosis), who takes up literally 80% of the song. Instead of screaming, Brent Hinds and Troy Saunders have both adopted a more calm and emotional vocal style. Brent Hind's vocals don't sound southern at any point on this album (as they did in all of the band's previous material) and Troy's voice sounds less like a caveman. Brent's voice hasn't changed much however, and you'll still always be able to tell his trademark \"nasal\"-style vocals from Troy's shout/croon-style vocals. Troy's vocals are the real noticable change, to be honest. For one, tracks like \"Oblivion\" will leave you wondering if the band got a new singer. He still shouts in the heavy parts, and still does his trademark death growl-type singing in one song (\"Quintessance\").\n\nMastodon has matured with each record, and it's always shown. Most people would have thought that Mastodon would have been satisfied with all the hype \"Blood Mountain\" got, but no, they seem to have realized what it's all about. Mastodon must have realized that it's about putting emotion and true feeling, like a piece of you was put into each song. It's this simple fact that will most likely make this the band's career defining album, and will also make this one of the most essential albums of the year, if not the decade.\n",
        "\nOuch! Be prepared for something different, come March 24th. \u2018Crack The Skye,\u2019 is surely a step in a different direction\u2026where I don\u2019t know though. This could be a step toward ascendancy or perhaps a plunge into the deep and dark waters of failure. The vocals on this single, \u2018Divinations\u2019 would take any hardcore Mastodon fan by surprise. \n\nIncorporated here, are some clean melodic singing bits and the regular shouts and screams provided by Troy Sanders. The music is tight as ever, and sounds just as good as any previous song, but the vocals are definitely weird and it sounds a lot worse than having a 1-tonne pickup ram you square in the face. The drums are spectacular, wild and incredulous and so is the guitar work. Mastodon have never disappointed me as musicians; they are a very, very capable band; technically accurate, tight as a unit. However, their vocals have always been a letdown, a terrible letdown. \n\nMastodon have never stuck to a particular style and the styles they have implemented and utilized have been disastrous. Personally, the harsher \u2018March Of The Fire Ants\u2019 vocal has been their best attempt, but the others have been failure through and through. These guys have always been a bizarre band from their early days, and not much has changed. However, I wish and hope that they could stick to one vocal style or in other words the vocal style that goes with their music.\n",
        "\nThe single \u2018Oblivion,\u2019 is a weird change from the Mastodon we have all known. Gone are the harsh screams which gave Mastodon the feel of a \u2018core\u2019 band. Replacing them instead, is a clean vocal played which is a refreshing change from the brutal noise of Mastodon\u2019s previous releases. Of course, this is just one track but it does speak volumes, and people can live in hope that Mastodon takes this route for all their releases. This may be seen as a step towards commercialization and may be taken quite badly by purists, but then again, name any band that haven\u2019t taken the commercial route. \n\nThe music in this song, \u2018Oblivion\u2019 is well paced out and played quite proficiently, with all the instruments sticking out. The drums as usual, provided by Brann Dailor, are exemplary and lives up to his reputation of being a technically sound drummer. \nThe song starts with guitars and the bass backing up the riff, followed by the drums that build up nicely, before moving into the regular onslaught of toms and snare work thrown in by Brann. The vocal is very absurd and, may be a tough pill to swallow, but damn these guys may have done the right thing by changing the vocal style. \n\nThere is no denying the fact that the vocal does sound like a pop-rock one but it seems to go with the music and that\u2019s what matters at the end of the day. Mastodon have in fact moved into uncharted territory with the vocal style and some orgasmic guitar soloing; believe me, the guitar solo in this song is really impressive and melodic and catches you completely unaware. It is a change; it is different; but only time will tell whether this is a step in the right direction.\n",
        "\nThis album basically lacks everything that \"Leviathan\" or \"Blood Mountain\" had. There is no clean singing, and the vocals sound like a cross between hardcore shouts and death grunts, with no melody whatsoever. Melody is one thing that Mastodon have always been good at, and it has always worked, even when vocalist/guitarist Brent Hinds attempts to \"scream\" and ends up sounding like a Hyena being beat by a caveman with a stereo (see \"The Wolf Is Loose\" live on Youtube and you'll know what I'm talking about). The only song to contain clean singing is \"Trainwreck\", and it's very weak, unlike later releases. I'm pretty sure that most of this album is done by vocalist/bassist Troy Saunders, who has always had a more tolerable voice, and who's voice sounds harsher and more angry. However, the vocals are barely in use here, as most of this album is instrumental. \n\nBecause the album focuses more on instrumentation, one would guess that the band would be like Neurosis and feature a large repotoire of instruments, or at least attempt to sound like they don't need vocals in order to sound good. Unfortunatly, the riffs, while very clever, sound like they need vocals to accompany them and therefore make them more noticable. The riffs are very well written and very groovy, as well as being very heavy, and bands like Dream Theater make up for this lack of vocals with technicality, but these guys don't have any show-offiness like DT does. It's all simple riff after riff. Fortunatly, the drummer makes things interesting by practically murdering his kit. He is fucking INSANE. His drum patterns are all over the place, and he is frequently makes use of fills, thus making him one of the higher points on this album.\n\nThe lyrics are my main problum. The lyrics are horrible. They really didn't put any thought into them, and the it's usually 2 words per line, which gets annoying really fast. I mean, seriously, who would read a 3 word sentance and say \"man, that was so meaningful!\"? Fortunatly the band would stop doing such things later in their career.\n\nMy favourite song on this album was \"Trainwreck\", because it was full of progressive and interesting guitar riffs, and is the most similar to what the band would later do. Another great track is \"Mother Puncher\" which is the sole song in which the whole \"ultra heavy sludge/prog/grind/hardcore/rock\" sound works, in that it never bores, and there is always another riff around the corner.\n\nIn conclusion, Remission, while not essential, is still a good listen. It reminds me of a mixture of Neurosis, Napalm Death, and System Of A Down. I would recommend \"Leviathan\" over this anyday though.\n",
        "\nI never used to like Mastodon, finding the few single songs I heard entirely underwhelming and mediocre. However, with enough prodding, any wall gives in eventually, and when I checked out Blood Mountain to see what the fuss was all about, I certainly didn't expect something this good, or something of any worth at all, for that matter. I expected something lame and fraudulent, a hollow, modernized pile of flashy, showy crap that didn't have any worth at all. I expected to dismiss it quickly and write some lame negative review decrying the band and all of their fans.\n\nBut no, Mastodon are the real deal, a bold and stand-alone band that makes no compromises and takes no prisoners. Blood Mountain is heavy, inventive and constantly moving forward. The band get a lot of flak for incorporating so many elements of genres like hardcore or sludge, resulting in what has become to be known as a \"modern\" sound, but unlike their contemporaries, Mastodon emphasize everything a \"modern\" Metal band should be, with their thick, encompassing sound and uncompromising, almost stand-offish approach to writing songs. None of these songs are dumbed down or weakened for radio airplay, and all of them charge forward with stomping riffs and a surprising amount of frenetic energy and ballsy technicality. Mastodon's sound is one rooted in heavy grooves, chunky riffs, time changes, complicated drum fills and everything else that is usually called The Enemy of Metal. Seriously, it's like a checklist of things I usually hate about modern Metal, and yet Mastodon strings it all together with unpredictable, tight songwriting skills and interesting ideas to create something that I find oddly appealing. The vocals aren't amazing, being a sometimes strained-sounding hardcoreish shout, but they work well enough, especially when they get harsher.\n\nI like this album because it does something new and creative and sounds good while doing it, plain and simple. It doesn't conform to any sort of trend, it just sort of exists as its own entity while other bands happen to play music with elements similar to it. Blood Mountain is singular and iconic, and while it is indeed very hateable, with many elements that most metalheads will cringe at, it really isn't bad at all. There are no radio-friendly songs, no simple melodies or pop-obsessed choruses, no mindless wank and certainly no wasted moments by the band trying to sell themselves. If you don't like Mastodon, they don't give a shit. I like that kind of staunch stubbornness in a band.\n\nThundering out with ballsy, creative rockers like \"The Wolf is Loose,\" \"Crystal Skull,\" the galloping instrumental \"Bladecatcher,\" and the unstoppable duo of the killer \"Mortal Soil\" and \"Siberian Divide,\" Mastodon have created something undeniably killer, an endless paradox of would-be vomit-worthy parts to create a grandiose whole. This stuff isn't exceptionally catchy, and there are a few songs that sort of drag on a bit, like \"Hand of Stone,\" but overall, Blood Mountain is a satisfying ass-kicker from a band that gets too much unnecessary flak. Recommended.\n",
        "\nDespite a lot of mainstream music outlets giving this album its proper due, there's definitely seems to be a lot of uninformed criticism of this record, especially in the aftermath of the band becoming popular years later. Detractors from the record, and to a further extent, the band fall into two camps; those who admittedly don't get the band and those who malign the band but, keeping in line with having bad taste, posit genuinely overrated bands like Opeth or Meshuggah as superior alternatives.\n\nA shame because, as Mastodon continues on this seems to be the most overlooked and under-appreciated album in their catalog, the opening salvo of a streak that would produce two classic modern metal albums.\n\nThe band itself has always been odd, composed of members who had respectively flirted with tech metal, hardcore, grind and hard rock, leaving the band and their common influences into a sludge-y beast that congealed into a mix of 70's rock, 80's metal, the oddly unsettling chorus-drenched guitar balladry of 80\u2019s Metallica, and Neurosis.\n\nTuned to Drop-A on occasion like the aforementioned sludge influence, the band was never heavier than on this record, though their rock influence, talked up in early Relapse press releases, is prominent in the songwriting, musical hooks, over-driven and noisy Marshall amp sound, and abundant Thin Lizzy-affected leads. \"3:30\"-\"3:46\" during \"Ol'e Nessie\" alone demonstrates some of the quirkiness that made Mastodon stand out in a stale genre burgeoning with metalcore clones, half-baked prog, past-its-prime tech death and hordes of uninteresting and over-produced European bands.\n\nIt's an extreme metal record that rocks, something that was rare and oft-ignored until metalcore bands like Avenged Sevenfold would turn that into a successful sales gimmick. The majority of that has to do with its rhythm.\n\nThe key to all music is rhythm; it's what differentiates something like The Violent Femmes' \"Add It Up\" from someone just blandly strumming a B power chord at an open mic. The core of a good riff is never the notes, it's its rhythm. Things like jazz and AC/DC always had a preternatural ability to determine where spaces and rests should go, why you shouldn't rush a phrase, why tremolo picking some C minor scale retread over blastbeats doesn't necessitate good music. Mastodon, from here until \"Blood Mountain\", understood that concept very well.\n\nThere's audible development in song structure, riffs change frequently and keep dynamic (although the band claims this is due to their \"musical ADD\") lending power to the longer songs which frequently contain dramatic bridge sections or riff refrains, which are frequently the only time Brann Dailor plays with the riffs as a standard drummer would, instead of playing \"lead drums\" against them. Though an aspect of the record that is criticized, it works because Dailor's actually a very good drummer, and someone who manages to tastefully overplay. This doesn't detract from the songs themselves because the band seemed to be quite aware of this and would occasionally surrender control of the dynamic and shift of the music to Brann as his drumming would take charge with the guitars and bass sometimes being static as he would appear to solo mid-song.\n\nThe guitars are no slouches either, supported by Sanders' distorted bass and employing everything from chicken pickin' to 70's arena rock harmonies to the signature open string arpeggios and interlude riffs the band made its signature. Against the more natural sound Marshall's produce, a lot of the guitar parts sound a lot noisier and more dissonant than they normally would, creating a record with crunch to spare and a lot of heft.\n\nThe \"groove metal\" tag is lazily slapped on this band now, but that seems to come from the vexing that they give some listeners, since there are songs that are blatantly Neurosis-influenced (\"Trainwreck\"), songs with more blatant rock feels (\"Mother Puncher\"), songs with a less-odd metered (and better written) Meshuggah feel (\"March of the Fire Ants\"). There are even a few death metal growls thrown in deep in the mix that, with the hardcore/sludge influence in the band, made them decidedly unique and difficult to categorize. This difficulty also made them appealing to all sorts, since they were never too much of one thing to alienate fans of a particular scene.\n\nIn terms of vocals, Troy is the dominant voice on this album, and possesses a gruff/hoarse sort of sludge metal throat that paces itself and is served well by the band's sparse lyrics. Like a lot of metal records, the lyrics are framed in sentence fragments and bandy ideas instead of presenting something fully detailed and literary like other genres. This isn't much a drawback since its a normal concession and a good amount can be determined or interpreted from what little is presented lyrically. As this is more of a guitar and drums record anyway, the lessened focus on vocals (particularly vocal rhythms which are performed well and in proper place but not anything special) and lyrics isn't surprising but doesn't really take anything away from the record as a whole.\n\nThis record was a landmark piece of original metal with great songwriting and proficient playing that hadn't yet (\"Blood Mountain\") bordered on the soulless and rhythm-less wanking of most progressive and technical metal. To tread a tired cliche, this album is just as heavy and crushing as their name, aesthetic, and song titles (\"Trampled Under Hoof\", \"Crusher Destroyer\", \"Where Strides The Behemoth\") implied and is perfect for anyone remotely into sludge but doesn't mind something that sounds this technical. Only hampered by \"Trilobite\" (which is maybe one plaintive Mastodon track too many and the sole dull entry on a surprisingly catchy album) and the second half of \"Trambled Under Hoof\" (which drags on a bit into \"heavy-for-the-sake-of-heaviness\" territory), \"Remission\" is a majestically heavy 00's metal and strong case that metal isn't quite dead. It's just that most of the bands can't write songs for shit.\n",
        "\nAnother underrated monsterpiece dying for me to review it!\n\nHere we go: Mastodon's 2002 \"Remission\", one of the most perfectly accomplished examples of how to create a fresh, inspired, aggressive, intricate and, most of all, NEW approach to metal music. Mastodon does that simply by throwing in the pot all of the inspiration they can get from any source of good music around them, regardless of styles and fashions, and re-reading the whole baked product through the \"Mastodon-Filter\" (read: contorted drum patterns, crunchy lo-fi guitar sound, indecipherable growls, masterfully arranged melodies, unusual song structures and a minimalist approach to lyrics, which leaves the texts open for personal interpretation). \n\nThe result is something so unpredictable that, once you hear it, you simply can't even try and compare it to anything you heard before; and for musicians like Mastodon, this is, nowadays, something to be proud of.\n\nAs for individual technical abilities of the band, there's no doubt they are very good musicians. The songs here aren't really showcases of virtuosity, but there's hints everywhere in these songs of what Mastodon is capable of. That goes with the exception of the drummer.\n\nBrann Dailor has got to be one of the most surprising drumming revelations of the years 2000. I remember when I picked the album \"Leviathan\", my first Mastodon album, I was absolutely stunned by what this guy had done. I mean, never in my wildest dreams I would have thought of playing drums on those catchy songs the way he did; and after a couple of listens, I still couldn't figure the logical pattern that the guy's mind should have followed in order to choose those drum beats for those riffs. After that, I thought he couldn't get any better, but I was happily proven wrong when I bought \"Remission\".\n\nSomebody might think Dailor is a \"wanker\" because, in this record, he barely plays a steady beat. But the biggest mistake you can make is comparing him to old-school prog-metal drummers, like for example Mike Portnoy. We are on completely different territory here, on a whole other planet! Dailor's drumming is incomparable to anyone else's in metal music, as personal and unique as it is! The closest comparison I can make is with Mike Giles of King Crimson. Anyway, in the many interviews he gave and which I've read, Dailor NEVER mentioned prog-metal drummers as a source of inspiration. And it shows! But enough about Dailor, let's get to the album...\n\nThe opener \"Crusher Destroyer\" and the following \"March Of The Fire Ants\" and \"Where Strides The Behemoth\"(probably the heaviest song on here) make immediately clear the band's intentions: total neurons annihilation. Some odd signatures (the alternate 3\\4-4\\4 of the opening riff of \"March...\", the 3\\4 of the opener's main riff and the 13\\4 of \"Behemoth...\"'s killer verse-riff), plus the anarchic drumming and the growls that seem to be coming out of a sewer all get together at once and start hitting heavily at you brain. By the end of side A, if you've been really listening, you should be jaw-dropping. If you're not, side B will provide you with the hardcore-influenced \"Workhorse\", the long, relaxed, imposing, majestic beauty \"Ol'e Nessie\" and the terrifying high-speed thrasher \"The Burning Man\", a real kick-ass!\n\nThe second part of the double record set sees Mastodon delivering their more trippy side but still not forgetting to include a couple of head-bangers here and there. \"Trainwreck\" is a long, tumultuous sludgey and slightly progressive track, adorned with beautifully original arpeggios that come back to mind every time I hear people talking about this song. \"Trampled Under Hoof\" is another head-banger with an odd signature and a catchy riff; this will be probably the weaker song of the album. \"Trilobite\", another trippy, sludgey composition, continues to explore the territories first trampled down by \"Trainwreck\", consolidating even further Mastodon as the undisputable kings of melodies and making so evident and appreciated the influence that Neurosis had on this band.\n\nLast side of the double-platter opens with a surprisingly twisted song, based on odd signatures, frantic drums and hypnotizing guitar duets: \"Mother Puncher\". There's a live video shot somewhere in Europe for this song that can be easily found on YouTube; I strongly recommend whoever wants to get into Mastodon to go and watch it. You'll get the idea of what I've been talking about all this time.\nLast song is an instrumental, \"Elephant Man\", dedicate to the homonym figure of Joseph Merrick. Now, this is what I was expecting from an instrumental song since Metallica gave us \"To Live Is To Die\". I'm not comparing the two, as they are far too different to be put on a level of comparison. But I can compare the feeling of satisfaction I felt upon listening to the two songs. After the last note has faded away I feel like fulfilled inside, as my day has reached his zenith and nothing can push me any higher.\nNotable the solo at the end of the song: not much virtuosities, but rather a very bluesy, melodic and tasty solo that gives a magnificent album like \"Remission\" its appropriate outro.\n\nFinal comments: buy this album at sight! You will not regret spending your money!\n",
        "\nThis, the second release by oxymoronic Tech-Groove metallers Mastodon is one of the most randomly energetic and just plain crazy sounding records you will hear in the style, it's three songs are just completely senseless and insane slabs of really quite heavy sludgy spasming. Only hearing the fairly acclaimed but only decent Blood Mountain, it's quite a surprise to hear this band deciding to go balls out quite as hard as they do here. It\u2019s the same awkwardly jumpy sound that\u2019s present on that album, but there is no subtlety to it and the focus is clearly on the angrier side of their music. There are no clean vocals, only one solo-y breathing break, and the vocals are far more aggressive and gruff, generally the occasionally submissive side of the band simply isn't here at all.\n\nEverything here is an odd mix of Immolation-esque (In terms of rhythm, not music) rhythmic insanity and pulsing, and extremely heavy doomy sludge metal as heavy as you'll find anywhere all flying at you at an enormous range of varying tempos from the speed of a bullet, to the slow wandering of some kind of amputee tortoise, all the while constantly backed by gibberish drumming thanks to Brann Dailor. I've never really considered the drums an instrument where someone could play \"gibberish\" as such, they are such a rhythmic instrument they tend to always have at least a little bit of a set sound to follow. Sure deathcore drummers play a fill after every bar of music, but still, it\u2019s still kept in a framing, but Brann here, he plays fills whenever the hell he feels like it, regardless of musical timing, and what\u2019s more, he manages to do it for 10 minutes straight. He pretty much randomly slashes his arms around the kit as much as possible 100% of the time, and it sounds like utter poop. I love my tech drumming, his kit sounds cool and all, but the songs are total wastelands of scattered noise because of the lack of any constant timing in place. If Flo Mounier is an example of a drummer who manages to play 60 fills a minute without missing a beat, Dailor is an example of a drummer who plays 60 fills in a minute and doesn't even play a beat.\n\nStill, despite the absolutely uncontrolled sputtering that this EP is, it's a pretty fun wild ride, not much of the technical wizardry that filled up Caparillian Crest seems to be present, this is a bludgeoning, pure and simple. It\u2019s really not a good album, per se, it\u2019s a mess, zero structure, zero restraint, but there\u2019s more than enough good pieces of music here to keep me entertained. A surprisingly wild ride from a band that is now a little bit tame.\n",
        "\nWithin the grand scheme of the musical world, amongst the thousands upon hundreds of thousands of bands, ensembles and solo artists, it is rare that we witness such a wonder in the rock genre as a musical group with lasting power that could span years and decades, if not centuries altogether. Such bands that have achieved this status obviously include The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rush, and in more modern times one might even go so far as to say Radiohead. The fact that all four of these groups wrote powerful and moving pieces consistently for many years is undoubtedly a shared characteristic, but this feat would most likely not ordinarily excel a band into \u201clegendary\u201d status. Were it not for their tendencies to constantly push the boundaries of their genre and evolve until the end of their discographies, would we see them as anything more than simply the authors of singles and victors of the Billboard charts?\n\nSpeaking primarily of The Beatles who have shaped and molded the rock genre many time over, nearly every one of their albums saw some form of evolution or progression between one another, not only in musicality but also in the sense of the genre as a whole; the step from Revolver to Abbey Road was a more comprehensive progression than most bands experience within their entire careers. It is these artists, whether it be The Beatles, Zeppelin or modern rockers like Radiohead, the musicians constantly changing their form and uprooting our expectations and cognition of the genre are the ones that truly go down in history as legends.\n\nAtlanta rockers Mastodon may have a long way to go to reach this highly acclaimed legendary status, but I'll be damned if they're not on the right path. 2002 saw the release of the band's debut LP, Remission, a raw non-stop assault of a complex, southern hardcore/metal amalgamation. Leviathan was released two years later, proving the first time of Mastodon's capabilities when it comes to ameliorating their flaws. Improving on the production of their debut album, Leviathan found a focused median between raw aggression and the clean production needed to propel the complexity and duality of percussion versus melody and harmony. Where Mastodon lost many listeners from the harshness of bassist Troy Sanders' vocals on Remission is vastly improved in Leviathan , not only by providing a more melodic singing but also by allowing lead guitarist Brent Hinds an equal amount of vocal limelight.\n\nNow the year is 2006, and Mastodon are looking to stir the metal world up again. 2006's Blood Mountain is the band's first foray into major-label territory since signing with Warner Brothers' Reprise, and further represents their fascination with the rhythmic and atmospheric nature of the progressive metal genre. Notably the largest difference between Blood Mountain and Mastodon's previous two releases is the variety between songs, as the listener can easily tell from the first few songs on the album lies more varied melodies and direction than nearly all of Leviathan . Brann Dailor (arguably the star of the quartet) kick starts Blood Mountain with \u201cThe Wolf Is Loose,\u201d unleashing a blazing four measure fill to set up guitarists Hinds and Bill Kelliher for a pick slide into a three and a half minute foray to insanity and back. Following tracks \u201cCrystal Skull\u201d and \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d show off Mastodon's newfound liking for all things progressive, twisting and turning through various rhythmic and tempo changes while at the same time displaying some of Dailor's fastest playing yet. \u201cCapillarian Crest,\u201d the album's first single, defines Blood Mountain in terms of pure musicianship and emotion. Beginning with an off-centered, hesitant riff lead by Hinds, the song soon ventures abruptly into a swinging, pulsating rhythm in three that plunges into syncopated 5/8 meter before the listener is even able to catch up. Vocalist Troy Sanders rescues the group from such rhythmic disorder by bringing them all back together and hanging onto that five chord as long as he can before Dailor snatches it right back, coercing his minions to do his bidding by ending the song to the swift pounding of his double kick.\n\nTrack six of Blood Mountain, \u201cBladecatcher,\u201d showcases a new concept for Mastodon; a dynamic instrumental in under four minutes, relying solely on Dailor's drums to bring the band to the conclusion of the tune. The second single off the album, \u201cColony of Birchmen,\u201d features Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme on back up vocals, and proves to be the standout and most varied track on the album. Consisting almost entirely of clean vocals, \u201cColony of Birchmen\u201d reaches new emotional crescendos one might have never thought possible when listening to Remission or Leviathan. Having reached multiple climaxes in previous songs \u201cHand of Stone\u201d and \u201cHunters of the Sky\u201d, the tenth track off of Blood Mountain gives the listener a break by providing a mellow electric-acoustic guitar chord solo, barely becoming melodic before \u201cThis Mortal Soil\u201ds signature guitar melody kicks in over a steady, mid-tempo double bass-driven groove. Relying once again on Hinds and Sanders' clean vocal talents, track ten's chorus contains entirely of such, rarely resorting to distorted growls to accompany the raw rhythm guitar. The final track of the album, \u201cPendulous Skin\u201d ends Blood Mountain on a slow, acoustic note, as all Mastodon albums do, and fades out the chaos with much more ease than \u201cJoseph Merrick\u201d or \u201cElephant Man\u201d could have ever even hoped at achieving on the previous two LP's.\n\nMastodon obviously wanted to attempt to create the all-around perfect metal album with Blood Mountain as opposed to simply going for raw aggression through and through as they had done on Leviathan and Remission. For the most part they succeeded, and when I say for the most part I do mean potential 2006 album of the year. If it were not for Isis' In the Absence of Truth released just weeks after Blood Mountain, I would have easily picked this album as the album of 2006, but as always Isis proves to be tough competition. With Mastodon's intention of making more than \u201cjust a metal album\u201d is of course much appreciated, but this also comes with higher expectations. The songs are incredibly more varied than any of Mastodon's previous work, the slow songs being even more desolate and the aggressive songs being more complex and cathartic.\n\nWhere Blood Mountain falls slightly short however is (coincidentally) in the variety as well \u2013 Troy and the boys proved to us that they can nail any sort of rhythm syncopation in the books and compose a sorrowful, acoustic track back to back, but we as a listener can't help but to ask for more; more sorrow, more hate, more emotion instead of simple and blind aggression. Almost anyone could immediately hear the stark difference in dynamics from comparing Leviathan 's intro track \u201cBlood and Thunder\u201d to track one of Mountain, \u201cThe Wolf Is Loose.\u201d Now that Mastodon has shown us this new, emotional and effusive dimension of metal, we can't help but want more instead of just a tease. That being said, this album is without a doubt the best metal CD to be released this year, perhaps even in the past 3 years. Don't miss it, even if you only listen to Tool.\n",
        "\nMastodon have to be one of the most boring bands I've ever listened to, and this album is clear cut example why. They blend groove and post-thrash riffs with a progressive sense so this album is kind of primitive, and I'll give em that for being original. However, blending genericly boring grooves and screaming/shouting vocals with progressive metal structures isn't exactly the best idea since the outcome will most likely bore the fuck out of you. \n\nNot only that, but there's hardly any decent riffs on this album, and all of the so called riffs on this album sound pretty much the same. Infact, the only decent riffs are on the first song on this album, and that isn't saying all that much. The drummer is talented no doubt, but he chooses technical skills over songwriting. Nothing he does sounds interesting, and as hells unicorn said, he doesn't keep a steady beat which is the main problem that this drummer has. Overall, this band just sounds so boring.\n\nAbout the only two songs that stand out at all on this album are the first two songs, Crusher Destoryer and March of the Fire Ants. The formal is easily the best song on the album, and while it's only tow minutes long, it contains one good ass riff that carries the song through. It's simple, but oddly enough, it works. The latter is kind of average, it's alright, especially compared to the rest of the album.\n\nAs for the rest of this album? Be prepared to take some Nyquil and grab a pillow, because you will most likely be bored to death with some of the most boring songs that you will ever hear. There is nothing interesting here, the groovy chugging \"riffs\" are boring and generic, and the drummer just goes on random wankery sessions, and while there are solos on this album, none of them save this album from the boredom that you shall experience. To top it all of, the vocalist can be pretty damn annoying at times. All he does is scream and shout throughout the entire album so he really doesn't help things at all.\n\nI really wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's not metalcore nor is it nu-metal or mallcore, but it still manages to be a pretty shitty album. It's not horrible or anyhting, I've heard worse, but this album just screams boredom. Eh, at least Mastodon would improve on their next album. Avoid this album, unless you're into genericly boring groove metal mixed with random and noisy drumming, or if you want a good night sleep. =P\n",
        "\nThe phrase, \u201cmajor label debut,\u201d is dreaded in a community that thrives on being against the main-stream. Blood Mountain, Mastodon\u2019s first Warner Bros. release is high quality metal and definitely a worthy follow-up to Leviathan without simply feeling like Leviathan II.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that there are more vocals and a lot less \u201cvokills\u201d on Blood Mountain, but the growls and shouts are still there. The sung vocals never cross into sappy crooning territory, think more along the lines of Zakk Wylde. These vocal changes follow a natural progression from their previous releases. From their early songs re-released on Call of the Mastodon and their first full-length, Remission, one of the dragging points was the repetitive and often drab shouting vocals. Leviathan mixed in some songs that were mostly sung rather than shouted (\"Sea-Beast\" and \"Naked Burn\") as well as varying the different gruff tones within the rest of the songs. The vocals on Blood Mountain are about as dizzying as they could possibly be. There are shouts, growls, prominent singing-parts from both Brent and Troy, and a passage toward the end of \"Sleeping Giant\" with a spoken-word vibe. Additionally, there are guest spots from Neurosis\u2019 Scott Kelly and Queens of the Stone Age\u2019s Josh Homme. Then there\u2019s the vocal Easter Eggs; strange squeals in \"Siberian Divide\" courtesy of The Mars Volta\u2019s Cedric Bixler-Zavala, a creepy distortion effect used in \"Circle Cysquatch,\" and bizarre babble and insect-like whistling in \"Bladecatcher.\"\n\n\nMusically, the striking point of Mastodon has always been the frenzied, free-form drumming of Brann Dailor. That\u2019s still present, evident from the first seconds of the album as the aptly titled \"The Wolf is Loose\" blasts off with a drum solo. The songs, in general, are less focused on bone crunching and more focused on stylistic shifts. \"Colony of Birchmen\" with guest vocals by Josh Homme would not feel out of place on a Queens of the Stone Age album. The Allman Brothers-meets-Atheist sound found on previous Mastodon songs such as \"Ole Nessie\" and \"Megalodon\" can again be found in Blood Mountain; \"Bladecatcher,\" for instance. There\u2019s also a breakdown in \"Capillarian Crest\" that sounds like a banjo-esque take on Rush. \"This Mortal Soil\" starts off with a spacey prog intro that flows into dreamy rock, then seamlessly transitions into ZZ-Top style Southern boogie. The album closer \"Pendulous Skin,\" has a \"Planet Caravan\" feel to it.\n\n\nBlood Mountain is the least straight-forward album Mastodon has made, and that\u2019s saying a lot. Like Leviathan, this is an album with great individual songs that are even more rewarding when taken as a whole. After throwing everything at the listener, including the kitchen sink, Mastodon will be hard pressed to create a more varied follow-up. From the bottom of the ocean via Leviathan, to the top of Blood Mountain, it\u2019s hard to imagine where Mastodon will go next.\n\n*review originally written for www.livingformetal.com\n",
        "\nBlood Mountain is a very difficult album to get a grip on. It\u2019s one of the most obstinate albums I\u2019ve ever heard released by a mainstream metal band, and not in a good, \u201cwe\u2019re-not-going-to-compromise-on-our-music-and-MTV-be-damned\u201d way, but rather in the sense of a band refusing to learn from it\u2019s past mistakes, or listen to any criticism offered. While in some circumstances, such iconoclastic behaviour is worthy of admiration, here I can only greet it with perplexity and, yes, a definite degree of disappointment. Because while it is true that Mastodon have enormous potential, it\u2019s equally true that they lack a clear idea of precisely what they want to do.\n\nThe radical divergence of opinions on this album certainly suits its confused nature. While some hate and others worship this album, I can\u2019t really seem to follow either mindset. Because really, there is almost as much to like here, as there is to despise. Mastodon are as capable of inspiring and pleasing as they are of aggravating the listener, which really makes this album\u2019s failures all the more crushing.\n\nFirst of all, the music on display here can certainly attest to the fact that these guys CAN play their instruments, and damn well. But even this brings me to the first issue I have with this album, one I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered before. Here the technicality can actually damage the music. Far too often the band seems desperate for something to do, so they\u2019ll randomly throw in a section where they haphazardly hit seemingly random notes and change the time signatures to some outlandish scheme, as if under the delusion that this somehow makes their compositions \u2018progressive\u2019. Meshuggah these guys are not. They simply lack the songwriting ability to accomplish such odd bouts of experimentation (for want of a better term) or thematic deviation within the same track. Nowhere is this more painfully obvious than in the instrumental \u201cBladecatcher\u201d, where after an opening that sounds like music from an old Zelda game, they promptly drop into an epileptic bout of tremolo picked riffs with some random noise that sounds like a heavily distorted recording of a guy shrieking 'buppity-buppity' into a microphone, with R2-D2 doing backing vocals. Essentially, the entire song is this odd Zelda-esque theme with the aforementioned random interval plunked down in the middle of it. Despite what these guys may have thought, it\u2019s in no way artistic, let alone enjoyable, and doesn\u2019t prompt the listener to do anything more than hit the skip button.\n\nAnother symptom of the overuse of technicality here is the over-the-top, utterly obnoxious drumming that plagues the entire running time of this LP, with the exception of the final track. Brann Dailor is, quite simply put, one of the most irritating drummers I\u2019ve heard, not because of missed cues, but because of his adamant refusal to ever SHUT UP. Everything seems to be an opportunity to throw in copious amounts of snare fills, drum rolls, useless beat changes, or better yet, all three in the space of one song!\n\nAnother problem that frequently crops up with this album (and I believe is, at least in part, responsible for the first one I mentioned) is the sense of aimlessness that dogs it. With significant portions of this album, Mastodon seem to have tried to walk the tightrope between introspective psychedelia, and the more focused realm of metal, and far too often fall off; and in fact, this only makes it that much more painful when it works. If the whole album could have maintained the monolithic, psychedelic, yet purposeful feel of \u201cSleeping Giant\u201d, it would be a classic. This is also perhaps the song where Dailor\u2019s drumming is at its least obnoxious, and is one of the few from this album I still listen to consistently.\n\nAnother disappointing aspect of the instrumentation is the dual singers. While normally with a pair of vocalists, one would expect a wider range of singing, here they sound practically identical. The only way to keep their contributions from blending together is through careful listening, which this album is not likely to provoke (at least not for long).\n\nIronically enough, for a band that seems so desperate to be labeled one of metal\u2019s progressive or innovative forces, the best songs here tend to be the ones that adhere relatively closely to more conventional songwriting structures. There\u2019s a reason \u201cColony of Birchmen\u201d was the single off this: it\u2019s one of the few songs here that sticks to a relatively straight-edge verse-chorus-verse formula, and in so doing, maintains a distinct sense of catchiness. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that it seems to have stolen all the good riffs and leads from the adjacent songs. Opener \u201cThe Wolf is Loose\u201d is another example of this, managing to maintain an almost speed metal feel throughout its short three and a half minute length. Once again, the main issue with this one is the ridiculously over-indulgent drumming, although, personally, the hardcore vocals don\u2019t do much for me either (although they\u2019re far more excusable).\n\nPerhaps most distressingly is the fact that the best quality of this album is not the music, but rather the artwork. Seriously, I have to give these guys credit for having a great looking album. The cover art and inside of the insert is impeccable, possessing a rather beautiful theme of psychedelic mysticism. While the artistic direction seems to derive its inspiration rather deeply from Hindu art, it depicts mythological themes from a variety of different sources, all to excellent effect. Pity the music inside doesn\u2019t really do justice to it.\n\nUltimately, I cannot proclaim this album to be anything more than the failure it is. While I admit that when I first bought it I was rather enamoured with it, the veneer of that admiration quickly wears thin. While this album is certainly more daring than anything I would typically expect of a band that has so smoothly flirted with the mainstream as Mastodon, it quickly reveals itself to be nothing more than a half-baked, na\u00efve attempt at progressive sludge, by a band too inexperienced to do justice to either of those genres. Until Mastodon learn how to accomplish their lofty goals, and to do so in a matter that gives a little more credit to the intricacies of the music they\u2019ve chosen to play, they\u2019ll continue to be laughed off the stage by metal fans that have experienced more than few trends in their time.\n",
        "\nMastodon's music is sludge with an edge: sometimes it has a progressive edge, and sometimes it's the edge of a battering ram that's pounding on you. Rather than going a wholly progressive route on the one hand, or over-pummeling you on the other, Mastodon strike a good balance between the two. In this balance, Mastodon create a sound not really heard much elsewhere, and it's a kick ass sound they're making. The main negative is that they seem to plug guitar riffs in here and there where they don't fit really well, making it obvious that they're still getting used to playing together.\n\nThe vocals on the demo were by Eric Saner, who left the band shortly after this demo was released. They are above average and energetic, though not really too much different than other hardcore yell-singing found in this genre. Still, if you're a fan of the band, it's nice to be able to contrast Saner's approach to the vocals on these songs with Brent and Troy's later approach.\n\nBill and Brent mount an awesome guitar assault here, nice a sludgy, but aggressive when necessary, and clean when necessary. I think one of the reasons that they've been compared to Metallica so much is not because of any similiarity in sound (which would be stretching it), but rather because they like to mix some slower stuff in with some really heavy stuff, ala Ride The Lightning or Master of Puppets. They can knock you on your ass and get your head banging with their guitar riffs, but they also have some nice clean parts on songs like Battle at Sea.\n\nThe bass is fine, getting a few prominent roles in songs. The drums, on the other hand, seem to always have a prominent role, as Brann is constantly beating on them like a mad man throughout the album. It may not be everyone's thing, but if you like insane drumming, you'll like Mastodon. \n\nThis is the first slab of metal by a great band. The problem here is that the material on this CD has been rereleased twice now (five of the songs are on the Lifesblood EP, and all of the songs are on the Call of the Mastodon CD). So, the main reason to get this CD is to hear Saner on the vocals, and hear what Mastodon originally sounded like when they first got together. (Note: the score dropped somewhat for the inconsistency at times [using riffs that didn't fit], and also because the riffs just aren't as good as the stuff that they would come out with on the albums that followed.)\n",
        "\nMore and more these days, the progressive metal tag is being laid upon Mastodon. Before Blood Mountain was released, the only claim they had to the genre was this release's status as a concept album and the epic-length track, \"Hearts Alive.\" \n\nIndeed, Leviathan might seem rather vanilla at first to a prog fan's ears. If you're a diehard fan of the genre, you won't necessarily enjoy this. On this album, Mastodon is actually surprisingly unpretentious. Song forms are for the most part, short, with no extended soloing, or really any soloing at all, for that matter. The songs are composed of big, simple, crushingly heavy riffs and grimy, ugly, \"clean\" interludes, backed by Brann Dailor's spastic, fill-laden drumming. If you listen closely, you'll hear some really interesting, sputtering double-bass patterns as well. He has a very simple kit, but he plays it for all it's worth. Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds share vocal duties. It's clear these guys aren't the best singers in the world, but this is primitive, heavy music. It works very well in the context of the album; their tortured barks perfectly complement the images of the sea and the infamous white whale Mastodon evoke.\n\nThe pacing on the album is excellent, from it's furious open to instrumental close. There's just enough variation in rhythms and riffs to maintain the listener's interest, even on the nearly 14-minute \"Hearts Alive,\" which contains absolutely no self-indulgent soloing. Even on an album of songs from two to four minutes in length, this epic doesn't overstay its welcome. Its placement on the track list is also quite appropriate, another testament to the album's impressive flow. \"Aqua Dementia\" segues into \"Hearts Alive,\" which builds and builds, then explodes, but never at any point does it lose its sense of direction or energy. The section of the song in which it winds down is also done quite well, and sets up the album's closing instrumental track, \"Joseph Merrick.,\" an ode to the Elephant Man. This would be their second song about him, I believe.\n\nOther highlights include \"Blood and Thunder,\" (the aforementioned opener) with its catchy main riff, triumphant interludes, and high energy; \"I Am Ahab;\" \"Iron Tusk;\" \"Naked Burn;\" and of course, \"Hearts Alive.\" However, there's not a mediocre song on the album or anything that sounds tacked on. \"Joseph Merrick\" could have potentially been a throwaway track, but as an epilogue, it works quite well. \n\nGive this one a few listens and try to appreciate it for what it is, instead of what you imagine it should be.\n",
        "\nThe boys from Atlanta have done it again. This is the fourth track off of their latest album, Blood Mountain, in the form of a single. There is also a live version of the second track, Crystal Skull, featured as side B.\n\nCapillarian Crest begins with a blast of all instruments, combining the intricate guitar work of Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher with the spastic, fill heavy style of Brann Dailor. After the intro, they move into a cascading flow of palm muted riffing and sliding chords. After a few verses of the same riffs, it cuts into the solo. If open strings, chicken-pickin', and whiplash-inducing meter shifts are your thing, then you've come to the right place. This is easily the best song off of Blood Mountain.\n\nCrystal Skull live is a strong contender, though. The taped tribal intro (which is actually Brann beating on an empty fuel drum) begins, and they jump right into the sonic freight train that is Crystal Skull. \n\nHonestly, there is nothing I could find wrong with this single. The quality is good, the production is good, the music is good, hell, this is a good single from a good album. I got mine from the Mastodon Merch store on their website for $20, which kind of sucks, but it is totally worth having this exelent record.\n",
        "\nAs a fan of prog metal, I was recommended this band several times by people I know on the internet. Some of their recommendations were good (Ayreon) and some were utterly atrocious (Pain of Salvation's Scarsick, which takes the nu metal styling's Dream Theater's Train of Thought tentatively flirted with and goes ALL THE WAY with them, even though nu metal is dead, dead, dead and not coming back). So while shopping at a used CD store (one of the last remaining in Memphis), I came across a double disc special edition of Mastodon's Leviathan. The packaging was slick, with the black and gold slipcase and intricate booklet art. But prog? Yeah, prog as interpreted by a group of cavemen.\n\nLeviathan occupies some mediocre junction where progressive metal, metalcore, and groove meet. The vocals are all horrible grunts and screams, some of which sound disturbingly like Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir (!) and others sound like a gorilla smoking crack cocaine. There are plenty of prog rock time shifts, tempo changes, and polyrhythms in evidence, as well as a drummer who seems intent on out-wanking Mike Portnoy (yeah, good luck, chump), but instead of soaring leads and sweeping keyboards, you get...chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga for all eternity. Disgusting sludgy, down-tuned rhythm clunking batters the ears like latter-day Sepultura played really fast. Instead of being energetic and invigorating, it's plodding, dull, and troglodytic.\n\nMastodon doesn't really play real solos, but there are some leads that are rather less distorted than the riffs, but they are still harsh for guitar leads. Mastodon abjures keyboards, even though keyboards contribute greatly to the sound and dynamic nature of prog metal and is practically baked into the formula (where would Images and Words have been without Kevin Moore's keyboard work?). The resulting sound is dry, barren, and scorched, with relatively little variation.\n\nThere's a concept of some sort, apparently involving a white whale (Moby Dick?), but the moronic, unintelligible vocals do not encourage the listener to pick up the booklet. The two barkers could be reciting Tennyson and all you would hear is URGH URGH URGH AAAAAAAGH.\n\nMastodon doesn't really suck. They are talented instrumentalists, and have a good grasp of basic song structure. But their style, presentation, and sound are mind-numbingly dull after more than a few minutes of their ceaseless bashing. In an interview, Mastodon claimed to be \"cooler\" than Dream Theater because Dream Theater \"look gay\" and James LaBrie \"sounds gay like an opera singer\" and various other things involving the word \"gay\". Gay or not (and the fact that they're all married with kids suggests otherwise), Dream Theater have infinitely better vocals, more interesting riffs, decent leads, and no groove/core bullshit (except in Train of Thought). Sorry, Mastodon, but you and your record are not cool. Not cool at all.\n",
        "\nAfter a lot of work e-mailing Mastodon and its associates, I figured out that this release was indeed considered a full-length album, which surely seems fitting considering its length and overall feel.\n\nCall of the Mastodon is a re-release of the demo that started everything for Mastodon-- only, this time, Troy Sanders and Brent Kelliher do the vocals instead of Eric Saner. I personally have never heard the song versions with Eric Saner, so I can not comment on the different vocals, but Troy and Brent both do pretty good jobs at them. They have a very strange vocal style, which surprised me at first. They sound like they are kind of forced out (adding a nice raspy tone), but in this case it is not a bad thing and please do not take it as such. In some spots, they do clean(er) vocals, but there is still some distortion to them. Clean(er) vocals on 'Call of the Mastodon' are, again, strange in my opinion... but they grow on you, they really do; adding a lot to the overall feel of it all.\n\nMoving on, all i need to say is wow this guy can sure drum. At first i wasn't too impressed because I didn't listen closely. When you DO, however, you will see that he has a very technical style. There are tonnes of fills in ever corner, and lots of variation. You will most definitely not get bored with the beats in this one. Brann does an excellent job, and doubtlessly carries his weight.\n\nThe bass and guitars are not bad at all either. The bass (usually inaudible in metal) is very present here, and you can hear it nicely. An example of this would be the start of the song Battle At Sea. It goes to show how effective the most simple of basslines can be it music. The tone of the bass in the beginning of that song still gives me shivers, and I just love to listen to that song because of it. Guitars are quite good too, nothing too special there though. They focus more on matching the rhythm with their own crazy riff, not always AMAZING, but no bad ones at all.\n\nThe only faults I could find with this album were the lyrics and the length of the album. Even though each song is good in its entirety, Mastodon should have made the songs/album longer. Lyrics in Mastodon albums usually follow some sort of theme. Ex. Leviathan - sea stuff, Blood Mountain - hills, forests, hunters. This album is a mix of the two somewhat, and I would have enjoyed it more if it followed one specific theme more closely. \n\nAt the end of it all, the simple lyrics and the length of the album are the faults of this album though I highly recommend picking up this album, because it is definitely worth the money. You get 28 minutes of totally sludgy, progressive metal out of 9 short, but superior, songs.\n\nHighlights: Battle At Sea, Shadows That Move, We Built This Come Death, Slickleg\n",
        "\nMastodon released their \"masterpiece\" entitled Blood Mountain. Once again the media made a massive ordeal on how Mastodon are the next \"saviors of metal\" and how they bring a refreshing style to the genre in a stale generation of metalcore. I will say their style is somewhat unique - I prefer my brand of progressive metal to be more epic rather than sludgy - but it was somewhat refreshing to hear something new rather than metalcore.\n\nAs saviors of metal - I doubt Mastodon fits that. Blood Mountain is full of interesting rhythms and very spastic music. A lot of jazz influence seeps out of the music along with a lot of strange time signatures and timings.\n\nThe guitar work is something that is hit or miss. The sludge sounding riffs have an off sounding tone that at first sounds very cool but by the end of the album a nice clean guitar was the only thing I wanted. There are some very nice thrash riffs present but they are few and far between. The leads are nice but also in a very strange guitar tone. The fret work is good and the complexity is top notch. The leads are even chaotic at times like in the song Bladecatcher. To really define the guitar work in simple terms is very hard. The guitars have a massive range on the album itself and are one of the reasons that the album feels very scattered. A solid theme or sound would have been nice to latch onto for at least part of the album.\n\nThe bass work blends way too much with the sludge guitars. Once I was able to pick out the bass lines (after a few listens) I could tell that the they were well written but as a fan of bass individuality I found that the bass itself blended in a little too much to be very catchy. The complexity does follow the non-linear feel of the album and that is something interesting.\n\nThe drums get on my nerves. Although a very good drummer, I found that Dailor uses WAY too many snare drum fills and once I caught onto that I felt the snare was a very overpowering element on the album. It's a very Mastodon sound they have with the drumming - but I felt that the drums could even be more diverse in their playing. He has the abilities and the intelligence but he seems to even be playing it a little safe by hiding behind his snare fills.\n\nThe vocals should be a lot more interesting then they were. Two vocalists that share singing duties usually give the album a nice range in the vocal melodies. As it turns out the two vocalists sound remarkable the same. It took me a long time to decipher which vocal belonged to which singer (with the help of a few music videos might I add) and in the end I still am not sure exactly of who is singing what. I was also disappointed with the \"harsh\" vocals on the album. Not all the harsh and even though they have more aggression - they sound as if he is trying too hard to be harsh rather than letting his vocals be aggressive. \n\nThe lyrics are actually kind of fun. Although I read the story that the album is supposed to be a concept album on, I would have never actually gotten it unless I had read it. The lyrics are sparse and very mysterious. They tend to follow the music well but for telling a story they aren't very descriptive - which is both a blessing and a curse for the album. It fails as a \"story-telling album\" but succeeds in letting the listener put their two cents into what the lyrics mean. \n\nOverall, Mastodon has released their masterpiece. Following in the vain of their writing and style they have really perfected their sound. But their sound is very strange. The sound is sporatic and sludgy and as an album I feel that it is quite forced. It tries to epic and jazzy a little bit too hard.\n\nSongs to check out: The Wolf is Loose, Colony of Birchmen, Capillarian Crest.\n",
        "\nFor some reason, even the hardheaded metal world strongly accepts the new Mastodon in their new, very subdued sound in comparison to Remission, and their EPs and demos. What we have here is very ordinary music with only pretty good drumming (again, contrasting to their previous material), average but catchy riffs, and indecipherable vocals which really aren\u2019t too bad.\n\nFor fans of the band prior to this release, instant change will be noticed as their old extremity is gone. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but Mastodon are capable of so much more. Although \u201cLeviathan\u201d is a very creative concept, the band just seemed to be too weakened by the mainstream media to create music that truly fits the bill for what the songs are about. Lyrically, the themes are immense and speak of a long sea voyage similar to that of the classic novel, Moby Dick.\n\nThe music really is good, but sometimes seems too dull. \u201cLeviathan\u201d certainly has its power in classics such as Iron Tusk and Hearts Alive, but the rest of the album is only ordinary hard rock with a hint of sludge. However, the band is meritorious and succeeds in creating a diverse atmosphere with a good mixture of clean and heavy guitar parts. Mastodon, in this case, outdo their previous efforts and successfully pull off the musical dynamics that were not as fluent before. Songs like the closer, Joseph Merrick, confirm some of the band\u2019s ability to achieve a completely different sound yet maintain coherence.\n\nThe quartet are good musicians, but drummer Brann Dailor, the most talented and technically-inclined of the band, does not play to his full potential. Sure, not everything has to be insane and based on his older milestones, but Dailor just seems to have gotten kind of mediocre behind the kit, save for a few very outstanding moments.\n\nThe riff department is certainly very able, \u201cLeviathan\u201d sometimes meanders into uncharted territory (which maybe suits the style they were going for given the theme) with some meaningless clean-picking guitar parts and progressive sounding movements; they just do not work the way they should have.\n\nUltimately, this is a rather diverse album for what Mastodon originally began playing. The music is average to good, the overall theme is awesome, and the musicianship is there (albeit more mundane). \u201cLeviathan\u201d is very easy to love, especially for newcomers to the band. At the same time, this release to older fans has the propensity to push them away. Still, \u201cLeviathan\u201d is recommended for both parties as this shows the turning point in Mastodon\u2019s career through advancement and regression.\n",
        "\nI'll be frank: Blood Mountain MIGHT be a really good album. It's got just the right level of technical flash, songwriting that shows clearly the band knows what they're doing, and a great mix of a whole bunch of different metal styles. Mastodons previous albums had all of these too, and they worked great. What Blood Mountain lacks is memorability. The riffs don't seem quite up to par with those on Remission, the vocals lack the power of Leviathan, and the entire package comes off with a restrained feeling. Blood Mountain is far more accessible, and in many ways less heavy, than the previous two Mastodon albums. That doesn't have to be a bad thing, but unfortunately for me that's the case here.\n\nUpon the first listen of Blood Mountain I could not help but feel something was missing. More listens made me appreciate it more, but never to the high level Leviathan had readied me for. While Mastodon has previously been able to keep fast and furious music going on and on without getting stale, most of the tracks on Blood Mountain meander without really going anywhere. Start with an intro part (usually with Brann Dailor's drumming in the foreground), move into a riff, then chug along for 4-5 more minutes. Throw in random solos and leads here and there and you've got any song from Blood Mountain. Its not a wall of noise but it lacks coherency. The ultimate effect is that the album gets boring about half way through and half way too early.\n\nIn spite of this, Blood Mountain is enjoyable. The drumming is excellent as on all of Mastodons material, and the bass is prominent and is not content to follow the guitar parts. Vocals are no where near as aggressive or powerful as Remission or Leviathan, which at times make the album feel somewhat cheap and lacking (particularly on Sleeping Giant). When viewed from the proper perspective - A concept album themed by earth and documenting a journey up a mountain to find a mystical skull - the album became far more interesting, for me at least. Guest vocal appearances by two men whom I greatly admire - Cedric from The Mars Volta & previously At the Drive-In, and Scott Kelly of Neurosis - is definitely a plus, but neither of their potential is used to the extent is could have been. Cedric doing his trademark nonsensical wails would have been far better than the limited part he does on The Siberian Divide.\n\nAll in all, Blood Mountain does set out what it wants to do, but it feels like a huge letdown compared to Mastodon's previous material. The album feels a bit like an experiment in a more progressive direction; perhaps the band can next fuse their older sludge style with the new and create something truly unique.\n",
        "\nSo Mastodon celebrates their \"workhorse\" years with a totally commercial cash-in DVD. Way to give a nod to the underground guys.\n\nWhen I spotted this DVD in the store I had just bought Blood Mountain and was really digging it, and the packaging was awesome so I figured why not, I'll keep riding the good wave this band has been giving me. \n\nUnfortunately, I buy music DVDs mainly for cool live footage, which allows me to forget I'm in my living room and simulates the live experience. The live stuff on this DVD is fragmented, of poor sonic and visual quality, and used more to show the various stages of the band's career than to entertain musically.\n\nAfter that I figured I would at least be uplifted by a cool documentary which shows some insight into the band. Instead, I saw a documentary on four goons delivering unprepared, half-assed speeches to the camera that seemed to be influenced way too heavily by Jackass. Musicians are rarely funny, and should rarely try to be. Lemmy from Motorhead pulls it off, as does Devin Townsend from SYL, but I'm not even sure they're doing it on purpose. The guys from Mastodon just come off as being really dumb. And then there was the whole farting sequence... I'm not even going to go into that.\n\nBottom line: where's the metal? Give me some damn music you bastards! I don't want to go shopping with you; I want you to play freakin' Crusher Destroyer so I can rock out. I'll give this DVD 25%, 20 for the simple presence of each band member, and another 5 for the packaging. Hell, I think I laughed once so here Mastodon, have a 26%.\n",
        "\nRegarded by many today as the crowning achievement of Mastodon, \u201cLeviathan\u201d has been hyped as some sort of revolutionary new wave in the metal world by its champions, many of whom reside in the mainstream of music media. Having obtained this album a while back after listening to and being utterly revolted by their other 2 albums (I still am after giving them a few more chances), my expectations were obviously low. After a rigorous set of listens I have found that I once again must differ with the sentiments of the mass media, although surprisingly this album has some inspired moments and is enjoyable at times.\n\nThe same flaws that were present on the other 2 releases have still endured on here, though to a somewhat lesser degree. Brann Dailor is still throwing way too many fills into the mix, being the quintessential spider monkey wanker behind the kit, but we do get the implication of a beat on most of the songs, something which \u201cRemission\u201d completely lacked. \u201cMegalodon\u201d has a decent speed metal section that showcases Dailor\u2019s ability to play a straight up beat, although constant section changes are incorporated to accommodate his profound case of ADHD. The vocals are a complete throw away, profaning nearly every decent death and thrash singer to ever take the microphone. The thing that saves this album from this is that the vocals don\u2019t drive the songs, which leads us to where this album has the advantage over the others.\n\nThere are sections of several songs where we get some quality riff work and some brief melodic sections that toy with some progressive influences. \u201cNaked Burn\u201d has some occasional soft sections where we get some eastern sounds, contrasted with some decent heavier riffs and some clean vocal tracks that sound a little like Ozzy\u2019s better days. The intro riff to \u201cAqua Dementia\u201d is another high point of this album, while the rest is somewhat decent speed metal mired by vocals that depict an image of a gorilla with a real bad case of constipation. \u201cI am Ahab\u201d, \u201cBlood and Thunder\u201d and \u201cIron Tusk\u201d also deliver some quality riffs and feature a rhythm section that is mostly tight and cohesive, now if only they could get someone who can actually sing and slow down the section changes a bit.\n\nHowever, the songwriting and riff machine of Mastodon is, at its best, far from consistent. \u201cSeabeast\u201d takes my pick for the album\u2019s commercial meanderer and fails to actually present a song, but instead a disjointed collage of ideas that passes itself off as progressive. I am confident that when people listen to this song they don\u2019t comprehend it, they just shout in a retarded voice \u201cHeavy Metal\u201d when they hear the distorted guitars kick in. \u201cHeart\u2019s Alive\u201d is proof positive that this band should stay away from breaking the 7 minute mark, let alone try to composer a 13 minute plus epic, something that will never work in the Groove/Metalcore genre no matter how many good ideas are thrown in. Listening to this song was comparable to the ADD test they did on that episode of South Park where they proceeded to read The Great Gatsby to the mentally retarded character Timmy in one session (it took the better part of a day) and then ask some question about an insignificant detail in the middle of the story. \u201cIsland\u201d falls apart instantly with the same issues heard on \u201cRemission\u201d, too many ideas, no cohesion, and the drums showboat themselves out of any semblance of order. \n\nIn some ways it is a bit sad to listen to this album, because it showcases the absolute limitation of technique removed from musicality. All of the members of this band are actually gifted with a good command of their instrument, but they can\u2019t write a song to save their own lives. Even when they do get a good idea going, they run to something different without giving it a chance to develop, like an immature child who bounces from one hobby to another without ever mastering anything. If you wish to check out this band, get this album and avoid the other two, and definitely do not buy this at full price, $5 is the highest that I can condone.\n",
        "\nWhen I first when shopping for Mastodon records, I stumbled upon this gem. I went there looking for Leviathan and came out with this (only because it was the only Mastodon CD they had their). I\u2019ll be honest; I had no clue what this is. I was even more surprised when I listened to it because it didn\u2019t sound like the Mastodon I knew. It was great nonetheless. \n\nThe album is a compilation of their early demo songs. It\u2019s raw, sludgy and dissonant. The music is hard and aggressive; it makes you angry when you listen to it. The dissonant sound really pulled me in. You don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going on at times, but I enjoy that. The music is a mix of sludge, death metal vocals and can sound a bit grindish at times. This definitely wasn\u2019t what I had expected when I bought it; by the way, it came with a great Relapse Records sampler CD, which was pretty good also.\n\nThis is before they hired their current vocalist and guitarist Brent Hinds. The vocalist on this album is Eric Saners. His voice is powerful, booming and a bit raw. On most of the songs he uses that kind of voice, except on \u201cWe Built this Come Death\u201d where he sings clean (not that bad either). His voice sounds a bit like Brent\u2019s at times.\n\nI knew already that Brann a very able drummer and this just justified that. Highly influenced by jazz techniques, his fills are fast and loud. He is possibly the most famous out of the four and for good reason. Without his drumming on this album, it wouldn\u2019t be the same Mastodon at all. Like on the song Hail to Fire, his drums sound like cannon fire, or at least that\u2019s the imagery I got when listening to it.\n\nThe guitars on this album are strong and grinding. Basically every song uses a very low tuning that really gives it that sludgy, dissonant feel. The riffs churn out really heavy, dark music. There are a few memorable riffs in song like Shadows that Move, Deep Sea Creature, Hail to Fire and the title track. There are some weird riffs like in the intro of We Built this Come Death and Battle at Sea (one of the lowest bass line I\u2019ve heard in awhile).\n\nAbout the bass, at times it\u2019s hard to hear with all the chaos in the front. But when you can hear it, it\u2019s low and slow. Plus it really adds a sense of darkness to the album on every song.\n\nOne thing I didn\u2019t like were the lyrics, they\u2019re some of the stupidest lines I\u2019ve ever read in metal. At times they didn\u2019t really make sense and are just a few lines. It sounded as if Eric was talking to himself at times, that\u2019s what\u2019s responsible for bringing the score down. Another thing is this is it kinda sounds like a continuation of Leviathan. You can see that\u2019s some of the songs have that sea theme or have a hint of it I often wondered if this was a prelude to Leviathan. Also some of that album art depicts themes of sea.\n\nOverall the album was great, except for the lyrics, but you couldn\u2019t really hear for some of the songs. I would recommend it to fans of sludge metal or just anyone who wants to see what Mastodon USED to be like.\n",
        "\nNostalgia is all but a foregone conclusion when the end of another decade looms near, or at least that is how it tends to go for anyone who spends too much of their free time trying to categorize everything witnessed in the past 20 years. Though obviously far from being a settled science, it can be rightly observed that the ebb and flow of trends has a quantifiable duration within time, and the popular sentiment of these trends being consigned to a decade is not without a certain degree of truth. In the specific context of the 2000s, a time most notably marked by a number of ongoing revivals within the metal paradigm, some rather bizarre oddities arose out of a side movement marked more by experimentation and a side order of cynical commercialism (under the guise of a pseudo-counterculture identity of course) was ascendant following the recent demise of nu-metal as a market force. Naturally such a movement found a ready home in the continental United States, and primarily focused on appropriating a number of cliches from one of metal's more primordial and rock-based sub-genres, namely doom metal. Though the notorious studio exploits of the likes of Baroness and The Sword during this time served to solidify this oddball trend as a safer alternative to deathcore within a broader context of the NWOAHM, they paled in comparison to the massive cultural splash made by Atlanta native sludge turned prog outfit Mastodon.\n\nThough in their earlier incarnation they were more of a tag-along act that meshed the dark and dank aesthetic of High On Fire and Crowbar with a technically self-indulgent jazz drumming gloss that descended into masturbatory showboating more than it bolstered any sense of sonic individuality, by the mid-2000s the emerging trend of traditionalism that would rocket The Sword into commercial prominence also set some Darwinian changes in motion that would birth a more commercially viable Mastodon. The resulting conceptual medley of songs that supposedly seeks to present a composite story based on a number of North and South American myths (one has to be high to make sense of any of it), fueled by a more eclectic yet ultimately scatterbrained approach to songwriting, would prove to be a fitting home for a massive, non-metal label like Warner Bros where mass appeal trumps artistic merit. To be clear, Blood Mountain is not a pop album by any stretch of the imagination, but rather a token progressive blip in pop culture's radar that manages to straddle the line between extreme and mainstream music. But more so than that, it is an exercise in sheer pretentiousness, both in terms of musical and lyrical content; thus it is unsurprising that it came to be the go-to album for their rabid, hyper-evangelistic fan boys, who often publicly proclaimed it the rebirth of metal as if the previous 10 years of revival efforts in Europe never occurred.\n\nNailing down the stylistic axis upon which this album rotates is something of a daunting task, as it just sort of runs the gamut of traditional heavy, doom and progressive metal devices while somehow managing to box things into a compact, commercial format. There is a remnant sludge gloss that sort of paints over the whole general arrangement, but more often than not these songs sort of meander between sub-genres, never really establishing a firm point of cadence while having clearly defined chorus and verse sections that just sort of cascade into each other all but accidentally. Brann Dailor's drum work, in all of its cacophonous glory, would appear to be channeling the rapid fill and transition approach that Bill Ward pioneered on much of Black Sabbath's seminal work, though it completely misses the boat on doing so with some semblance of order and flow, and serves more to cut any transitional feel between seconds off at the knee. To be fair, the erratic mess of doom and progressive riffing out of Brent and Bill's guitars doesn't really help matters, more often switching out a sense of rhythmic precision for noodling lead guitar fragments and incongruous scale runs. The vocal work is really the only constant that attempts at keeping the arrangement together to some extent, though the mixture of clumsy hardcore shouts and cheap attempts at aping Ozzy Osbourne's signature nasally bellow come off as either lame or unintentionally comical in spite of their consistency.\n\nThe actual songwriting formula at work on these generally radio-friendly anthems of confusion could be best described as a deconstructed mishmash of traditional and progressive ideas, resulting in clashing sections with often jarring and abrupt shifts in between. Whether it be d-beat dominated fast offerings such as \"The Wolf Is Loose\" (kicked off with a showy drum intro no less), or more swinging fast-paced wanderers such as \"Capillarian Crest\" and \"Circle Of Cysquatch\", the guitar themes are fragmented and Dailor seems too busy impressing himself with his ability to jam 50 different ancillary drums fills into a three-minute song to care. The only thing that resembles an effective speedy offering from a standpoint of riff symmetry and punch would be the instrumental tech fest \"Bladecatcher\", and being the pseudo-Avantgarde dopes that Mastodon are, they turn it into a massive joke by throwing in all of this cartoonish Tasmanian Devil noise when things get cooking. On the more looming and doom-like side of the equation is a dreary melodic ode \"Sleeping Giant\" that starts off solid but gets kinda disorganized once the drums come in and the bad Ozzy vocals garble the atmosphere. Similarly Sabbath inspired riff work manages to show itself on \"Colony Of Birchmen\" and \"Hand Of Stone\" at a few key points, though again, Dailor's diarrhea of the hands proves to be a massive liability and sabotages things. The only song on here that manages to be consistently tolerable is the muddy sludge-fest \"Crystal Skull\", which sticks closer to the sound this band used to somewhat better effect on Leviathan and features a somewhat competent Iommi-inspired guitar solo.\n\nAs this album approaches its 13th year of age, and almost the same amount of time having past since the author of this review originally assessed it as one of the most insipid attempts at mocking heavy metal that he'd ever encountered, its so-called cultural significance in the eyes of its defenders is dwarfed only by its utter lack of congruity. From a standpoint of pacing and song length, there is a logic to it being among the more fondly remembered of this band's early repertoire, as it makes a noticeable attempt at copying the mixture of fast and slow moments that were fairly conventional in the mid-2000s. Be this as it may, when I square the lofty story line of someone trying to place a mystical relic on the top of a mountain fraught with fantastical beings and dangers with the assorted mess of notes and drum showboating that makes up the music, the pieces just don't fit together in any way that is discernible, let alone enjoyable. Mastodon as a purveyor of original music would get notably better on subsequent albums after shedding their woefully terrible attempts at synthesizing a sludge metal sound and moving in more of a retro progressive rock direction, which seems to be where they were trying to go at times on this album, though the clashing elements of traditionalism and technical showboating ended up turning whatever good ideas were intended into a pile of mush that supposedly sounds much better drugs are tricking one's ears.\n\n(Rewritten on August 1st, 2019)\n",
        "\nIt is impossible to collaborate with a musician under the age of 23 who hasn\u2019t heard of Mastodon, they have been a media darling of sorts as a token metal band for the masses for a few years now. However, until 2 years ago I was happily ignorant of their existence, then my band was in search of a drummer and we ended up going with a kid who was fresh out of high school and looking for a challenge. Our collaboration with him lasted a meager 6 months and the only real fruit of our labor in trying to get him to keep a steady beat was me receiving this album as a birthday gift, which was quite elucidating as to why we had problems with him. \n\nMastodon plays a rather unique blend of Groove and Technical Metal, unique in the sense that no one else plays Groove Metal like this because the two concepts completely contradict each other. When music grooves, the drum beats are usually boring straight beats meant to induce the urge to nod your head to the music rather than bang it, but in the case of Mastodon you\u2019d have to have 5 heads coming out of your shoulders nodding in a random overlapping manner in order to be in sync with the drums, which are so steeped with changes and fills that any sense of beat is completely gone.\n\nThe next symptom of this contradiction is the rather large collection of random riffs thrown together to make a distorted collage of misshapen sounds. In order to realize the groove aspect of the dichotomy, we obviously need simplistic riffs that stick to your cerebrum, mostly by boring the hell out of you and leaving an impression of painful drudgery. But if we are also to be technical, we must have rapid changes, so what we get is a massive collection of unrelated riffs all pasted together, guising as something that can be followed by the human ear. When you combine the ridiculous number of over-developed ideas (yes, it is possible to do this, although Mastodon is the only band I\u2019ve heard that actually pulls it off) with the pretentious drum wankery, you are left with one simple question. Where the fuck is the song in this mess? The truth is, there aren\u2019t any songs on here, there is only 11 tracks with varying time lengths containing noise, albeit noise that took a lot of effort to create.\n\nWhile the instrumentalists are obviously in possession of technical ability, the vocalist exhibits the exact opposite extreme. At best, the vocals on here can be described as a non-Brazilian version of what you heard on Sepultura\u2019s \u201cChaos A.D.\u201d, which was probably a fairly big influence on this band. However, whereas on that album you could somewhat understand the lyrics (which were downright idiotic I might add), on here the vocals are so garbled that unless you read the lyric sheet you think your listening to gibberish being screamed by a Baboon with Tourette's Syndrome. When you actually read the lyric sheets, much of what you read is sheer nonsense, having a bit in common with the quasi-Dadaist style of System of a Down. \n\nNaturally, there are some small areas of sound on here where you get something resembling music. Most of these are found on the closing track \u201cElephant Man\u201d, where we get more groove than we do technical groove, resulting in a redundant though at least listenable ballad with some melodic guitar leads. The added bonus here is that the singer has decided to shut up and let the music go it's own way rather than add some stupid spoken part. \n\nThe remaining tracks on here are all interchangeable with each other and can be distinguished only by their time lengths. Whether it\u2019s the short fit of pointless and meandering minimalist riffs surrounded by a 2 minute drum solo guising as \u201cCrusher Destroyer\u201d (what a dumb fucking name), or longer swamps of musical diarrhea such as \u201cTrainwreck\u201d (hence the name) and \u201cMarch of the Fire ants\u201d, none of it can be recalled by memory after being heard. The only thing you get is an impression, and it fades quickly when you seek out better music.\n\nNow how does one explain the massive following that this band has? Why are they so damned popular? I struggled with this for a little while before remembering where this music came from. Throughout the early 90s there was a rather comical yet pathetic display of monkey see monkey do that resulted in the quick life and death of both Groove Metal and Grunge. Kurt Cobain\u2019s and Sepultura\u2019s success in the 90s was the result of what drives lemmings to commit mass suicide, you don\u2019t question why something is either good or bad, you simply listen because that is what everyone else is doing. The initial impression that anyone is listening is provided by the industry which produces it, and then it snowballs from there.\n\nSo to all of my fellow metal heads out there whom are either contemplating buying any releases by this band or questioning why they are so big, let offer some advice, don\u2019t bother with it. This rather massive swamp of decrepit excrement is not worth anyone\u2019s time. Truth be told, I\u2019d rather have my eyes plucked out and then be skull fucked by a T-Rex rather than listen to this again.\n",
        "\nWhen I first started listening to \u201cheavy\u201d music \u2013 which was, interestingly enough, only about 5 or 6 years ago, I was a dirty \u201chardcore kid.\u201d Better than being an emo kid, I say. Anyway, I was at a stage when I was listening to the heavier offerings of the latter genre \u2013 Bleeding Through, As I Lay Dying, Killswitch Engage \u2013 and occasionally sampling some of the earlier metal offerings, such as Sabbath and Maiden. Mastodon\u2019s \u201cIron Tusk\u201d was the first, truly HEAVY metal song I ever listened to, and readers I must admit I was fully won over. Although now my tastes range far beyond hardcore, and my favorite bands are no longer the previously mentioned ones (rather, they include Nile, Cryptopsy, Suffocation, Neurosis, Death, Behemoth, and Spawn of Possession), that song \u2013 and video, which is also amazing \u2013 will always have a special place within my memory. \n\n\u201cLeviathan\u201d was an amazing CD, and although I have nearly limitless confidence in Mastodon as a band \u2013 how could one not with a band that cites such giants of sound as Neurosis as one of their main influences \u2013 I honestly did not think that they could top it. Even though they seemed to be getting better and better \u2013 \u201cRemission\u201d was also great, but also very inaccessible and disjointed, as well \u2013 \u201cLeviathan\u201d was a nearly-perfect work of conceptual metal. Knowing that these guys were doing the same routine for the next album, I can honestly admit that I had my doubts. Could they still make quality music without it being too derivative of their previous works in both style and idea? Yes, they could \u2013 and they damn well did. \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d is not only an incredible album; it is a work of art. I am proud to own it, and you owe it to yourself to share my pride in claiming ownership over this masterpiece. \n\n\u201cBlood Mountain\u201d is astounding in the fact that the band never steps wrong. Ever. There is not a single song that is out of place on this CD, not one track that distracts from the overall ebb and flow \u2013 not even the schizophrenic and seemingly drug-induced \u201cBladecatcher.\u201d Holy FUCKING SHIT is that song ridiculous. So, not only are the songs all great, many (if not most) are standouts for Mastodon as a band; this album contains some of the most praise-worthy work this band has done \u2013 and, frankly, will ever do. Among them, \u201cCrystal Skull,\u201d \u201cSleeping Giant,\u201d \u201cCapillarian Crest,\u201d \u201cCircle of Cysquatch,\u201d \u201cColony of Birchmen,\u201d \u201cThis Mortal Soil,\u201d and \u201cSiberian Divide\u201d all stand out as amazing works; some of the best material ever put out by Mastodon. I was luckily able to obtain the bonus DVD version of the album, \u2013 the last copy of either version in the store! \u2013 and watching the 45-minute, highly-entertaining \u201cmaking-of\u201d documentary, you gained a lot of respect for these guys. They all worked their fucking asses off on this album, playing beyond the best of their respective abilities. What they have created, is a truly sublime contribution to the metal community and the music community, as a whole. \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d completely captures the essence of being lost in the wilderness, and all sorts of emotions are evoked by each of the songs \u2013 anger, fear, insanity, paranoia, sadness \u2013 making it not only a truly captivating listen, but also an extremely moving work, as well.\n\nMastodon has undoubtedly expanded their musical style on this album, and I use the word \u201cexpand\u201d rather than \u201cshift\u201d or \u201cchange,\u201d as I fail to see this CD as being a hugely dramatic departure from their previous works. True, most of the harsh screaming and growling vocals have disappeared \u2013 and so what? Although I enjoyed them, I enjoy the clean vocals just as much, and I think the more melodic vocal work on this album is truly indicative of the wide span of musicianship that these guys are capable of. Many have accused Mastodon of \u201cselling-out\u201d on \u201cBlood Mountain,\u201d and to those who truly, and honestly believe in their hearts that Mastodon has sold out, I have but one thing to say to you: shut the fuck up. Oh, and you are all retarded, too. (Sorry, two things!) When a band sells out, they compromise their musical integrity for financial accumulation, with the intent of acquiring a more mainstream fan base. Although I could receive shit for this, I do not believe that Mastodon is any more accessible on \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d than they were on \u201cRemission.\u201d Watching the doc, it is clear that they integrated clean vocals with harsh growls because, as Brent Hinds states, it \u201csounded better\u201d in that case. Mastodon is still as puzzling as ever \u2013 the lyrics are bizarre, the themes are far-fetched, fantastical, and most likely have no place among the same crowd that listens to Angels and Airwaves. I honestly like the evolution that Mastodon has taken here, showing advancement in musicality and maturation of the band as a whole.\n\nSpeaking of musicality, holy shit. This is, quite simply, some of the best guitar work I have ever heard. The drums are less frenetic on this album than the others \u2013 showcasing the increased focus of the band \u2013 but no less technical or astounding. Brann Dailor is an incredible drummer. Troy Sanders discusses (in the doc) his heightened confidence about his work on this album, and that is a very accurate assessment. The guitars and drums clearly dominate over the Troy in several areas, but his baseline is far more audible, and sufficient props must be given to him for his improvement and dedication. As I said before, the guitars are amazing; Brent and Bill play the shit out of their axes, and I\u2019m honestly amazed that they are able to memorize all of the notes. Incredible work by all of the guys, bravo. \n\nI guess in the end what truly matter is how it all comes together. Like I said, \u201cRemission\u201d was a mess, and although \u201cLeviathan\u201d was far better, it sounded too much like \u201cRemission\u201d (not a bad thing, though!). What \u201cBlood Mountain\u201d did for me, few other albums have done. It evokes the feelings of dread and anxiety one experiences when faced with the impossible (in this case, a treacherous mountain ascent). It is not only a stunning album; it is disturbing, as well. You feel at times like you\u2019re not even listening to a work of music \u2013 rather you are listening to a perilous adventure story akin to the ones your father or grandfather told you in your youth. What an amazing CD.\n",
        "\nI own Remission, which I can't say I enjoyed very much; and I own Leviathan, which I thought had several great ideas but was ultimately plagued by some horrible flaws. I never agreed with all the hysteria regarding Mastodon being the saviors of heavy metal and whatnot (and I still don't), and consequently I haven't really been keeping up with the band. So, it wasn't exactly to my surprise when Blood Mountain was released and praise for the band had apparently grown exponentially within the week... same old sludgy stoner metal, I thought.\n\nNot so.\n\nGoing on the whole elements thing, Blood Mountain is focused around earth. I'm not entirely sure what Mastodon were going for here, but it involves a guy making his way up a mountain, facing all sorts of trials on the way in the form of various fantastical beasts, and reaching some sort of enlightenment in the end. Not as cheesy as it may sound.\n\nThe first major point of difference involves the vocals. No longer are they inconsequential like in Remission, nor are they the mostly vomit-inducing garbage found on Leviathan. They're at the forefront of the mix and play an important role. Bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders sounds sort of like a soaring Josh Homme from Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age (who has a guest appearance here), and guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds tries his best to blatantly rip off Neurosis' Scott Kelly (who, coincidentally, also has a guest appearance here), but doesn't really succeed. Or maybe it's the other way around... I'm not 100% sure who sings what. An amusing thing is the sometimes negative impact that otherwise great guest vocals have here - notably Scott Kelly's appearance on the second track \"Crystal Skull\". He comes in midway through the song with that powerful roar that he's so well known for... and ends up totally embarrassing Troy and Brent when they come back into the fray afterwards. It reminds me of what happened on \"Blood and Thunder\" off of Leviathan, when Neil Fallon of Clutch came in to sing his part and consequently made the Mastodon boys sound utterly trivial and weak in comparison. Regardless, the vocals here are far improved over anything Mastodon displayed in the past... except for the robotic vocal effects used on \"Circle of Cysquatch\", which are remarkably awful.\n\nThe next (or actually, this should have probably been the first) thing you notice is drummer Brann Dailor. What the fuck. This guy has always walked a fine line between righteous drumming and unnecessary hyperactivity... and on Blood Mountain, I think he has finally crossed it. He constantly traverses his relatively small kit with incredible speed, throwing in fill, after fill, after fill, after fill, after fill. In fact, you probably wouldn't be too far off base if you said that some of the songs on here are comprised completely of fills. I'm not trying to put Dailor's talent down or anything, it's just that he tends to overindulge himself quite often on this album. A lot of the fills are fucking great though, like on \"Siberian Divide\" - holy crap is that song amazing. There's also a lot of groove to be found here, and a good level of diversity. \"Sleeping Giant\" features some beautiful and extremely fluid drumming throughout the introductory passage and again somewhere towards the middle... I was surprised and pretty damn impressed.\n\nThe riffing has taken a few steps up... sounds like Bill Kelilher finally remembered his technical death days in Lethargy. Phew. I'm not going to go through all the great riffs that exist on this album, as there are a lot of them, but suffice it to say that just about every song has something exceptional to offer in that respect (except for maybe \"Bladecatcher\", which has some weird King Crimson-esque noodling and nothing that's very riff-oriented). There are also a few guitar solos thrown around and several extended instrumental interludes, all of which actually amount to a refreshing development in Mastodon's sound.\n\nAn exceptional release, all in all.\n",
        "\nI would like to start by saying that Mastodon became one of my favourite bands along with those \"old-schooled\" I was used to, almost since the day I first heard \"Naked Burn\" on a radio show and that's because of its power, headbangin' boost (man...I've seen them twice and nice shows they were), technique and simplicity which all combined are able to offer us music in all its sheer greatness.\n\nThis DVD is perfect in the way that allows the viewer to easily follow their story (still short, yet great) with balanced dosis of fun, documentary wealth and, I insist, honesty (I guess that'll be one of their most well succeeded ingredients). You can testify all the talents of the band mates (especially Brann Dailor's astounding skills) without being massacrated with \"guitar lessons\", unecessary jamming, \"look it's me the best player in the world\" poseur attitudes, if you know what I mean. Besides, everything is told in a language able to capture anyone's attention without any problem.\n\nIn what concerns to live footage, the choice is very well done, in my opinion (in spite of the normal sound/image problems, of course). I would highlight \"Ol'e Nessie\", \"Workhorse\", \"Hearts Alive\" and a raw and so very different version of \"Naked Burn\" (I must admit every song of them is a highlight to me...). The videos appear in the DVD almost as a bonus, I guess.\n\nI can't give a better rate just because I would prefer to see a little more of themselves (in Iron Maiden's \"Early Days\" style), but what the Hell...they're still young. \n\nIn a few words: very nice release! Long live to the Mastodon! May its tusks bite the entire world!\n",
        "\n\"Remission\" is a really good album. It's a very surprising album. True, many times it gives a feel of some sort of chaos, but that is just because it's a new type of music and after you start getting used to it you can see the patterns in the music and you realize how brilliant this album is. I tried to define what genre Mastodon are, but failed miserably. Maybe it's the beginning of a new genre. Their originallity brings a new wind to my CD player, and they have the talent to support it.\n\nWhen the album kicked off with \"Crusher - Destroyer\" and it got to the fast riff and then solo part I knew this album is gonna rock. Brent Hinds and Bill Kelliher take the lead here and the occasional solos don't fail. The riffs are not particularly fast, but they are (all) good and rather in the speed for headbanging. It must be pointed out that there is a lot more to Mastodon than headbanging, and they construct riffs which are both intricate and comprehensible.\n\nThe vocals are quite forgettable, which is a good thing. It means that the music stands for itself and there are a lot of instrumental parts. A glance at the lyric sheet shows very short lyrics, as Troy Sanders can find the time to play bass, which is more important, since when he does both the bass sounds somewhat shallow.\n\nOn the other hand, when Sanders does not sing the bass is rich, wild and stands for itself, which adds a new dimension to the music. This is true for both the quiet and loud songs, however it is slightly more audible in the quiet ones.\n\nThere are four relatively quiet songs in the album. Listening to them showcases Mastodon as energetic and attentive to details. They show that Mastodon are highly talented on both technical and composition scale. They are not as good as the loud ones, but are definately not boring.\n\nBrann Dailor is one of the (many) highlights in \"Remission\". The drumming is very unique and border breaking. He plays in unusual tempos and breakes beats like a madman. It's like he plays several drum solos in one song. Sometimes he takes it too far and doesn't harmonize with the guitars, but even in these times he shows some excellent talent. Even the quiet songs has the most passionate drums I heard so far, and he should be credited fot that.\n\nProduction has made an injustice with Dailor. The album leaves the drumming in the background, and they are fully audible only in the quiet bits. The same goes for the vocals, but in this case it's for the best. The bass, however, receives a lot of attention and the mixing makes sure we all know what Sanders is doing. The guitars sound somewhat diffused and not enough concentrated (which also adds to that misleading feeling of chaos).\n\nIn an overall look, little things, but mainly the quiet tracks, keep the album from being scored 100, yet none of them overshadow the great talent and potential, the original music, the heaviness and the overall excellence of \"Remission\". My personal favorites: \"Crusher Destroyer\", \"Workhorse\", \"Burning Man\", \"Trampled under Hoof\".\n",
        "\nSludge music usually brings along bands that best engender a type of aggression that is so raw, that the flaws in their music perceived by the audience are actually perfections to the bands themselves. Following a sort of almost lethargic drone at times, along with melodies which seem almost unnatural for the inexperienced listener, Mastodon have created a sublime environment of aggression and subtlety within Call of the Mastodon.\n\nFrom the indecipherable vocals of Troy Sanders and Brent Hinds, to the insane drumwork of Brann Dailor, Call of the Mastodon is a kick in the face to the world of average, melodic music.\n\nThe music itself usually is consistent of the sludge category, while sometimes evoking an almost grind feel at times. Even then, the music in this album also emanates some strange melodies that tend to go against the grain of modern music; mainly because of the guitarists use of open stringed picking on their baritone guitars.\n\nThe vocals on Call of the Mastodon are distorted screams of rage and never let down their attack on the listener.\n\nThe guitars are often drony and chaotic, while many times contorting their way around versatile rock licks and subtle clean-guitar picking passages. Truly, the riffs on this album are very entertaining and stand out. This feeling is highly expounded upon by the very low end of their baritone guitars which, unto themselves, bring a distinct sound which makes their riffing much more interesting to listen to.\n\nThe bass serves to accentuate the heaviness throughout the album, but never becomes the focus of instrumentation.\n\nThe drums are purely the work of a genius who truly knows his calling. They are performed is such the way of a sort of jazz style, yet with a much more dominant and hyperactive approach than that of the average jazz drummer. Brann Dailor dominates Call of the Mastodon with his percussional expertise and creativity; and, were it not for him, Mastodon really would not be the exceptional creative band as they are known.\n\nThe songs themselves are oftentimes quite progressive, but pack a punch that most progressive music does not. However, unlike standard prog., the songs on Call of the Mastodon are short in length; good enough for a memorable, headbanging experience.\n\nOverall, Call of the Mastodon is a very entertaining EP (that should be classified an LP) that is superb in all aspects of their style and serves as more than just a testament to their original sound.\n",
        "\nAtlanta-product Mastodon has made some big waves within the metal scene in the past years with their debut Remission and colossal follow-up Leviathan. Mastodon, branded as playing \u2018progressive sludge\u2019 by critics, breaks the mold by adding more influences to their musical repertoire than just the fused elements of doom and hardcore. The band stated that they wanted to start a \"prog-revolution\" with the new album, but did they really mean it? They certainly did. \n\n\nMastodon chose to utilize the same ingredients to make Blood Mountain as they did with Leviathan. They used the same studio, same producer, and same lineup. Though using the same formula, they created something entirely unlike their previous works. With Blood Mountain, Mastodon has built off of the progressive elements from Leviathan, as well as improved on their songwriting and vocal-work.\n\n\nThough the new album is different, Mastodon still has the same sound; crushing guitar riffs, Brann Dailor's signature million-fills jazzy drumming, and the blending of acoustic and electric guitar. Playing the first track of the CD, I was expecting a mid-tempo, simple riff to get things started, similar to the start of Leviathan. Instead, the first track, entitled \u2018The Wolf Is Loose\u2019, throws at us Dailor drumming the hell out of his set, warning us that the path up to Blood Mountain is not going to be a stroll in the park. \n\n\nSongs like \u2018Capillarian Crest\u2019 and \u2018Circle of Cysquatch\u2019 really show off Mastodon\u2019s technical ability with time shifts, tempo changes, and blazing-fast guitar solos. On the other hand, songs like \u2018Sleeping Giant\u2019, \u2018Hunters of the Sky\u2019, and \u2018Siberian Divide\u2019 revert to the band\u2019s sludge metal roots with slow and extremely heavy rhythms. Nevertheless, each song contains flawless guitar work, progressive instrumental sequences, and clear production.\n\n\nBassist/vocalist Troy Sanders displays a variety of vocal techniques throughout the album. Sanders\u2019 clean vocals in Blood Mountain are more present than in the previous two albums. That's not to say that the gruff growls are gone, as almost all tracks are full of them. On occasion, you will hear guitarist Brent Hinds bellowing to the sky, like a cursed fisherman lost at sea; a characteristic taken from Leviathan, which in fact was influenced by the novel \u2018Moby Dick\u2019. Blood Mountain also features various guest vocalists, such as Cedric Bixler-Zavala (ex-At the Drive-in, The Mars Volta) and Joshua Homme (ex-Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age).\n\n\nTrue, Mastodon has given us a variety of fresh and catchy riffs with Blood Mountain, but the real praise is given for how well the riffs flow together. Each line seemingly feeds off the other, one paving the way for the next. Once you start nodding your head to one riff, another comes into play, continually competing for a spot in your head.\n\n\nMastodon has pulled the best elements from southern rock, hardcore, sludge, death, thrash, and progressive, and has blended them all together into a musical journey titled Blood Mountain. Mastodon\u2019s continual pushing the envelope of metal may soon place them among the top American metal bands, and perhaps spark a new wave of progressive metal.\n\n\nOriginally written for Texas A&M\u2019s student newspaper, The Battalion\n",
        "\nWith this album, I think Mastodon has become one of my favorite bands ever. They just keep getting better and better by each album. Remission kicked ass, I fell in love with Leviathan and now Blood Mountain blew me away.\n\nI remember the first time I heard the first riff of the first song in Leviathan, I Am Ahab. At that very second I knew I was going to love this. I had the exact same feeling when I heard the drum intro in the the first song of Blood Mountain, The Wolf is Loose. And I was certainly not let down.\n\nMastodon just keeps expanding it's horizons. The albums keep getting more technical, but the band doesen't loose the point of the show anywhere along the way. The vision is strong and even with all the trippy breakdowns and complex flowing songs, the album keeps everything together. And it never forgets to groove! There are some fucking awesome riffs on this album. I don't think there is even one bad or even mediocre riff on this album. Each and every one of the riffs are needed and in their right place. I don't think I've felt something like this after Dark Angel's - Darkness Descends.\n\nI've heard some bad words about the vocals, and they sure are a bit different than in Leviathan and Remission. But after a few spins of the cd, you just forget about it and realize how well they fit the more evolved sound. And it's not really a radical change at all. This is still 100% Mastodon up your ass.\n\nWhat more can I say? I guess the only con on this album is that the ending song, Pendelous Skin, isn't as good as an ender as Joseph Merrick is in Leviathan. But the opening riff of Circle Cysquatch more than makes up for this, as I think this is probably in the top5 of \"The Most Badass Riffs Ever\"\n\nI know my review just sounds like full of hype and I bet everyone of you are thinking \"it can't be that good\" Well, it just is. When all the old timers these days say \"Oh, remember when we smoked pot and listened to Pink Floyd. Pink Floyd just kicks ass\" Well, when I'm old I'm gonna remember the times I listened to Mastodon.\n\nThe wolf is truly loose.\n",
        "\nThis album was hyped a lot last year, and so I was fairly reluctant to get it, and didn't get it till today. Damn, what a huge waste of time, because this album is really good. Lots of big riffs with frantic and unique drumming- the way this kind of metal should be.\n\nThe albums starts off with a 4 minute long adrenaline rush called \"Blood and Thunder\". Great song name, and a great song too. Some pretty interesting and techincal parts, a few time signature changes and interesting drumming. The vocals are kinda strange, but while I don't really like them, they do really fit the music. They are the usual hoarse vocals, mixed with.. something else. I guess the best comparison would be a mixture of Aaron Turner and some old salty sea dog. Well, maybe that's just me. \n\nThe songs all sound very different, even though most of them follow a fairly similar pattern to the first song. \"I am Ahab\" is full of fast metal riffs, with a few time-sig changes thrown around. Seabeast has some interesting clean vocals, and a rather awesome outro. Again, lots of big riffs. The best way to describe these kick ass riffs would be like a mixture of Justice Era Metallica and Celestial Era Isis. They're fairly fast, though not really thrash metal fast, and they're fairly busing riffs. Not a lot of long, sustained chords, but while that may be a problem for a lesser band, it works well in Mastodon. The drumming really deserves a mension here. Calling it \"Unique and interesting\" really doesn't describe it that well. The drummer, while he definetly keeps the beat going, he rarely plays anything twice. Some drummers might play a fill every four bars. This guy plays a fill, well, almost every bar. It fits really well though.\n\nBasically every song fits the above descriptions quite well, with a few clean parts thrown around, to good effect. One song that doesn't, however, is the huge, almost 14 minute long epic that is \"Hearts Alive\" A big long clean build up that Pelican would be proud off, (Don't know if the Pelican drummer could do what the Mastodon drummer does though) and then it quickly jumps into heavier territory. There's some vocals here that sound almost like Neurosis here, but they fit really well. The song slowly builds up, changing between heavy and clean parts again and again. It's really, really excellent stuff, definetly the best song on the album, and rthe song you should probably preview.\n\nAfter that stunning song, the album ends with \"Joseph Merrick\", which is an awesome clean track, again, essential listening. Basically, the whole album is essential listening. If you like metal that is left of field and full of huge riffs and great ideas, check this album out.\n",
        "\n\"Genre defining\"\nThis label seems to be stuck to so many bands these days. In magazines like Metal Hammer, bands like Soil are considering \"genre defining\" - and, as of late, in Terrorizer and other popular underground magazines, this band (Mastodon) has been hailed as one of the most extreme bands today, and the most original. Due to all the hype about this band, I though I would give them a listen.\n\nBefore I get into this review, I'm more into the Black Metal side of things - I won't say no to Death Metal, but I put my foot down at all these \"core\"'s they are coming up with to label medicore music these days. I don't mind a BIT of hardcore (Tragedy is above average in those stakes) so I'm not out to review an album of a genre I don't appreciate - and then just end up bagging the genre in broad, general terms.\n\nThe album starts with \"Crusher Destroyer\". The guitar is attempting to sound chaotic I gather, with the \"hectic\" drumming making it sound \"all over the place\". The guitars aren't really working all that hard, and the drummer is being technical for the sake of being technical, as it's not really lending to the flow of the song. But then again, I guess they aren't striving towards \"flow\".\n\nThen it's \"March of The Ants\". I actually thought it was still the first song, but obviously not. (It's a good thing I looked at the display while I'm typing this.) I give the drummer credit, he can drum, but I don't hear anything original here. It goes on with the typical DM \"squeal\" of the guitar until it goes into a... punk riff! Or Emo, depending on how bitchy you want to be. I would have been more delighted it he started signing above this with \"why... did you leave.. me\" because it would be so befitting with the melody line, but to no avail. I never realised that repeating unemotive, banal riffs was genre defining.\n\nNow it's into \"Where strides the Behemoth\". Where strides the originality? I'm really confused as to why people think this band is so special..? Being a guitar player myself I don't see the greatness in their guitar work. Maybe it's the whole stop, start, stop, irritating rhythm, lack of structure that draws in such devoted fans? Or is it the reviews in magazines?\n\nWorkhorse: this intro riff is boring. And ooh, surprise, its some awesome rhythm changes and quirky little beats. This next riff is a little Black Metal sounding I guess. This guy's voice doesn't change at all. Neither does the guitar. Overall, a boring, background music kind of song.\n\nOk, I can't even be bothered going into the rest of the songs on this album. For reviews of the next songs, just look at the reviews of songs above, they are pretty much identical.\n\nConclusion:\nI must say the drummer can drum. Unfortunately, he does the same patterns throughout the whole album. Don't get me wrong, Black Metal is full of continous blast beats, but noone really gives it more credit than it's due. I don't see why some guy changing the timing every 30 seconds, doing special/quirky little things here and there (sequences) is so fascinating/new. Perhaps all their fans are drummers. (This is why I gave the album 25%).\n\nThe guitarists of this band are average, I found none of the riffs inspiring, emotive, aggressive to the point of making me go \"Now here is a angry riff\" or original. They are technical, but not talented in a creative/expressive sense. What's the point in being technical, if you can't capture the listener in any emotive way?\n\nThe vocals are pretty average, so I can't really make a good metaphoric insult about them that would make me laugh. Pretty damn uninspiring and boring... which sums up the album really.\n",
        "\nIt\u2019s hard to recall a band making such a massive impression in such a short time. Mastodon, like Lamb of God are currently experiencing a huge a wave adoration and popularity. And for good fucking reason too. This band is simply one of the more exciting metal acts in the scene today. For all of Metals pigeonholing genre\u2019s, it\u2019s the bands who, what I like to term, \u2018work outside the box\u2019, that make the biggest impact on me. Mastodon is one of those bands. \n\nMastodon made a tremendous start to their career with the tasty \u2018Lifesblood\u2019 ep, which was quickly followed up by the highly acclaimed (by both critics and fans alike) \u2018Remission\u2019 disc. High expectations were abound for the mighty \u2018Leviathan\u2019. If the band felt any pressure, there isn\u2019t a shred of evidence on this little gem. \n\nThe interesting thing with this band is that their style is so hard to describe to the ordinary music fan. We\u2019ve had Math-rock, Metalcore, American Metal, Art-rock, classic metal and technical thrash thrown around. And there is merit in all of those descriptive terms. Mastodon does incorporate those elements. However, I\u2019d prefer to call this band a straight up fucking guitar rock band - Filthy, dirty, bar room rock. When you can\u2019t come up with anything specific, resort to \u2018rock\u2019 and that\u2019ll cover it. Still, there is a real esoteric element about this bands song writing in that you\u2019re never quite sure what they\u2019re going to do next. \n\nUnderstanding that, you know that Mastodon refuse to play by the regular rock establishment rules. This is where \u2018Leviathan\u2019 becomes more than a great rock record. It is not a safe album by any means. Having garnered a rather healthy audience via the excellent \u2018Remission\u2019, Mastodon could have quite easily churned out a similar sounding album (Remission Pt 2, perhaps) and their fan base would have lapped it up, no complaints. Judging by the experimental, almost progressive nature of \u2018Leviathan\u2019 Mastodon has done anything BUT take the easy road. I thought I knew what this disc was going to sound like, because that\u2019s the way most bands work don\u2019t they? They stick to a formula. Quick note: Mastodon doesn\u2019t do formula. Mastodon does curveballs. They take risks. This is a very good thing!\n\nNoting the bands willingness to evolve and try different things, it needs to be stated that Mastodon haven\u2019t become all over-technical or complex on us. Their choppy riff passages have always had the potential to swing towards Dillinger style Math-core, but on \u2018Leviathan\u2019, if anything, Mastodon are more accessible than ever. There has been a massive groundswell of hook and melody injected into their song writing \u2013 it\u2019s actually allowed more depth to their music. Yet, having said that, they\u2019ve been able to establish a tremendously dynamic dirty rock sound. They\u2019ve become a bit more edgy in a 70\u2019s kind of way; even more metal if you like. Either way, their music, their compositions are fabulously innovative and loaded with charisma and original appeal.\n\nWith a sense of melody injected into \u2018Leviathan\u2019 songwriting, the vocals have also become an important factor. You will recall \u2018Remission\u2019 as a straight red-line vocal approach. Not this time punters. The depth I alluded to earlier is accentuated five fold with both Brent Hines and Troy Sanders combining perfectly between moments of screamo/aggression and \u2018cleaner\u2019 sections. Mastodon is now a more varied prospect to listen to vocally, yet never contrived or manufactured for mass consumption. \n\nIt\u2019s rather difficult to ignore the captivating and original vibe of \u2018Leviathan\u2019. It literally smokes from start to finish. This is a band that stands on it own within a plethora of sound-a-likes. They\u2019re like a metalized Clutch meets Neurosis meets early Metallica meets 70\u2019s style Rush!

        "\nMastodon are back with their highly-anticipated and hyped new album, but are they really back? Gone is the crushing heaviness of 2002\u2019s Remission, gone are the brooding passages culminating in heady explosions of near-incomprehensible but cathartic guitar fuzz, gone are the thick, meaty, satisfying production and riffs. These tenets of the band\u2019s full-length debut are replaced by a thinner and shallower guitar tone, simpler melodic passages with leaner and more streamlined song structure, and ultra-grating clean vocals.\n\nGranted, barring inevitable comparisons to its successor, Leviathan on its own is a solid effort. In diluting their sound for mass consumption, Mastodon have still managed to retain some of Remission\u2019s heaviness, some of its aggravated dementia, some of its effortless stylistic shifts. \n\nThe album starts off solid with the punchy, pseudo-thrashy \u201cBlood and Thunder,\u201d which in itself might make new Mastodon fans with its simplicity and straightforward, driving structure, or might alienate old fans for the same reasons. Overall it\u2019s a suitably \u201cMastodon-y\u201d opener that does well to introduce listeners to the album. Unfortunately, the inferior \u201cI am Ahab\u201d and \u201cSeabeast\u201d follow. The latter contains the wretched new melodic vocals, which will in themselves alienate several longtime Mastodon fans, and both songs are just too aggravatingly shallow to be considered essential to the Mastodon catalogue.\n\nMetalcore-laden \u201cIsland\u201d is next. It\u2019s a strong stand-alone song, as well as suitably complex, but the hardcore-soaked style will definitely piss off some connoisseurs of the band. The thirst left by the last song\u2019s inconclusiveness is satiated with Leviathan\u2019s arguable high-point, \u201cIron Tusk.\u201d This crowd-pleaser harkens back to frenetic numbers such as \u201cBurning Man;\u201d what the song lacks in depth is redeemed by its unbridled ferocity and incendiary drumming courtesy of the ever-amazing Brann Dailor.\n\nThe band continues with a blues-influenced song that builds in speed throughout (\u201cMegalodon,\u201d another highlight), and two more songs that draw heavily from hardcore (melodic \u201cNaked Burn\u201d and pseudo-technical \u201cAqua Dementia,\u201d the former grating and the latter merely unimpressive). \u201cHearts Alive\u201d is the \u201cepic\u201d for this album, starting slow and brooding but building to an imposing maelstrom of furious (yet calculated) instrumentation; the song pulls of its duty quite respectably while perhaps lacking finesse in shifting styles. We close with \u201cJoseph Merrick,\u201d a decent closer in Mastodon\u2019s familiar \u201csomber, understated ballad\u201d style, this time sounding eerily like a bluesy Opeth.\n\nSo, we have a varied mix of mostly positive elements. But, as I said before, the album retains some of Remission\u2019s heaviness; some of its ferocity; some of its complexity. This is not essential Mastodon, nor is it quintessential. While it is a solid record, those looking for a revolutionary release should keep searching.\n",
        "\nYou'll be familiar with the scenario by now: Band X releases their album and, eager to get your hands on a copy, you rush down to your local record shop or stand by the door, waiting for the postman. The record is well received by the music press, gathering 'album of the year' nominations by the bucketload and everyone's happy. Until, that is, six months down the line, when some goon at the record company decides that it would be a great idea to re-release the album with a couple of bonus tracks tacked on to the end in an attempt to squeeze a few more bucks out of the record buying public. The bastards. And they wonder why so many people use Kazaa...\n\nMy reaction upon reading that Mastodon's megalithic first album, Remission, was to receive this treatment was a predictable mixture of incredulity and frustration. However, having missed Mastodon when they toured the UK, the lure of the bonus live DVD bundled with the album proved too great for me to withstand...\n\nThe album in its original form was as good as it gets, alternating between overwhelming brutality, see \u201cCrusher Destroyer\u201d or \u201cWhere Strides the Behemoth\u201d and haunting beauty - \u201cO'le Nessie\u201d and \u201cTrainwreck\u201d. There is not a bad track on show. Each time I listen, I find something new and exciting. \n\nAnd then there's the playing... Words cannot describe how good these men are, suffice it to say that they are worthy of their name and must be seen to truly be believed. The sonic equivalent of a runaway freight train...\n\nStandout moments: the glorious feeling of anticipation during the introduction to \u201cMarch of the Fire Ants\u201d, the furious riffage and crazed drumming of \u201cBurning Man\u201d and the sheer metallic beauty of \u201cO'le Nessie\u201d.\n\nUnusually for a re-release, there is only one bonus track; \u201cEmerald\u201d, a Thin Lizzy cover. While it doesn't really fit very well with the brutal prog-metal that makes up the rest of the album, it is a great song. I've never heard the original but Mastodon carry it off well and it's pleasing to hear that Troy Sanders can sing as well as howl.\n\nAs for the DVD, superb is the word that comes to mind. Containing seven songs from Remission and two from their debut EP, Lifesblood, but sadly not \u201cEmerald\u201d, this DVD captures the raw energy, passion and excitement of a gig as well as any recording could ever hope to. The performance is phenomenal and Brann Dailor's drumming is the best I've ever seen, bar none. The only fault is that the backing vocals are a bit low in the mix but they're not that important so this doesn't really detract from the performance.\n\nIt amuses me that this was released at roughly the same time as the Linkin Park live DVD. As far as I see it, you have a simple choice: intelligence and talent or bluster and boy-band 'metal'. Your call.\n\nThey obviously employ a higher calibre of goon at Relapse.\n",
        "\nWhere did these guys come from? Remission is Mastodon\u2019s first full-length album, and it instantly made them one of my favorite bands ever. Their style, which mixes death metal with some stoner, grind, grunge, and even a little jazz, is totally original and completely unprecedented. \n\nRemission is filled with some super-fast and thrashy numbers (namely \u201cCrusher Destroyer\u201d), but at the same time, it isn\u2019t lacking in slower, more acoustic \u201cballads\u201d (\u201cElephant Man,\u201d and it\u2019s not a ballad, but it\u2019s slower and softer than anything else on the album). \n\nWhat I\u2019d really like to point out about Remission is the absolutely amazing drumming. Brann Dailor is a veteran to the metal drumming scene and it really shows here, with seemingly sporadic but masterfully placed rolls and sharp accents. Mr. Dailor doesn\u2019t do much cymbal work (or it\u2019s not prevalent in the mix), but he\u2019s a veritable wizard on the double kick and snare. The rest of the band\u2019s members have substantial talent and they do their job, but they\u2019re nowhere near as astounding as the drummer. The vocals sound more grind than death, and it can get grating, but it fits. (They\u2019re the reason I took off one point.)\n\nAnother notable thing about Remission is the production. It\u2019s raw and organic, making for a rough sound while still being very crisp and retaining the audibility of each instrument.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this is one of the best albums of 2002, and any fan of great drumming or something different in metal should definitely seek this one out. It\u2019s a sublime experience.\n",
        "\nThis EP is really good. The songs are complex, heavy-as-hell compositions that are really great as stand-alone tracks. The one problem I have with this is its lack of unity. The songs are composed of riffs and ideas the members wrote before joining the group and the finished product reflects that. Keep in mind the songs are still really good, and if you're not looking for a whole-album-experience, you'll love this. The track \"Battle At Sea\" is especially amazing, and it contains one of my favorite metal drum fills ever. Overall, the EP shows the tremendous potential of this band that they utilize on \"Remission\" and will hopefully continue to utilize on later albums.\n",
        "\nRelapse Records seems to have it's finger of the pulse of everything that is pushing the boundaries of intensity in today's metal scene. From the over the top grind of PxDx and Agoraphobic Nosebleed to these guys, the aptly titled Mastodon, they sure know to pickem.\n\nOne part Dillinger Escape Plan, the other part Kyuss, Mastodon are uncomprisingly heavy, yet they still manage to make dynamic and memorable music. \"Dynamic\" is the key word here... \"aesthetics\" would be another one. Mastodon shift from texture to texture flawlessly, creating soundscapes that bring to (my) mind cosmic planes, windtorn deserts, and other such imagery. Musically, they use dense riffage and intricate signatures to the fullest, without sounding too frenetic... in fact, it is possible not to notice their technicality on the first listen, a result of their ace songwriting.\n\nThe most extraordinary thing about Mastodon, however, is their drummer, Brann Dailor. Holy shit, this guy tears up the kit on this one, dropping mind boggling fills and snare tricks almost every few seconds. The Remission is one of the only albums I own (tool's lateralus is another..) where it's easy to pay more attention to the drums than the band as a whole . THAT is how good this guy is... his cymbal work is commendable as well. \n\nI don't know if I would use \"stoner rock\" to describe Mastodon, but the droning guitar tone and penchant for ear candy does nothing to revoke it. If you dig on the whole Relapse scene you should have no trouble falling for Mastodon... excellent band.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m not sure how I got into these guys but I am sure glad it happened. I first downloaded March of the Fire Ants and truthfully I wasn\u2019t really overwhelmed. I checked around to see what people had to say about this band and since this was their first full length there wasn\u2019t a whole lot to be found. From the small amount of opinions and reviews, I gathered the same overall feeling from them, \u201cthis album rules,\u201d simply translated.\n\nThe best way I can describe their sound is a rock feel (southern), added with metal heaviness, up-tempo for the most part and hardcoreish vocals but with a flavor of their own. Play the first track and you start out by feeling the intensity Mastodon can accomplish. Midway through the song great melody is displayed with an almost bluesy type feel on the break. Throughout the first four tracks they use the same intense feeling while mixing them up quite well.\n\nI can\u2019t go on further without mentioning Brann Dailor\u2019s drumming. This is some great technical drumming with excellent fills without over taking the rest of that band. I believe that this is a key element to Mastodon\u2019s genre escaping sound. \n\nAfter four tracks of intensity I was starting to hope they wouldn\u2019t stick to that formula the whole album. It was good but just not what I wanted on a whole. Much to my delight and surprise, Ol\u2019e Nessie was next. This song is much slower with some clean guitar but intertwines well with a louder more aggressive feel and then clams back down again. The rest of the songs have alternate feels as you can probably guess by the song lengths at this point in the album. (Short = fast || Long = slow/fast) It also ends with a great closing instrumental that is one of my favorite songs on the album, albeit there really is no weak song on Remission.\n\nIn the end Mastodon has a remarkable sound and album that is nicely put together. Although the vocals could be bothersome, I think Mastodon can be relished by fans of many different tastes that are able to handle some intensity and enjoy something that is distinct and quite unique.\n"
