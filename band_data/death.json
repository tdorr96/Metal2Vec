    "Band Reviews": [
        "\nDeath is a band that I respect very much and often look to for inspiration. The same can be said for the band's past moniker, Mantas. Death had a history of putting out various demos, rehearsal tapes, and live tapes that have helped the band gain exposure as well as shape the metal subgenre known as \"death metal.\" This practice even dates back to the Mantas days. Mantas and Death have always managed to impress me with their demos, and this live demo is of no exception. I would have to say \"Live Tape #2\" is one of the best recordings Death put out during their earliest years.\n\n\"Live Tape #2\" is a live demo that Death recorded during 1984 when they were still called Mantas, and published after they changed their name to Death. This demo acts as proof that the band had their stuff together right out of the box. There's much to complement and little to complain about in terms of this particular release. \n\nA very notable aspect and a strength of this demo is how well the audio quality is. The dynamics of the vocals and the instruments is pretty even. I'm impressed that you can hear the vocals clearly and maybe pick out a few lines of lyrics while the guitars and drums blast away. For an old school death metal demo, that isn't always the case. The drums don't overpower the guitars & vocals and vice versa. Just like with the vocals, the guitar riffs are easily heard and decipherable to some extent. I don't know how the band recorded this demo. This could've been recorded through a soundboard or it could've been recorded on a boombox the band brought with them to the gig. The latter of which I find to be more likely. Regardless, this is top notch material for an obscure demo. \n\nThe track listing on this demo is comprised of the songs that would make their way onto Death's first 2 demos (\"Death by Metal,\" which was first released by Mantas, and \"Reign of Terror\"), a cover of \"Poison\" by Venom, and Mantas's self titled song. I think it is very cool that the songs from \"Reign of Terror\" were first written and performed under the Mantas moniker. That is something new that I have learned through this demo. I believe this is the only release that was published under the Death moniker to contain Mantas's self titled song. I wish the band would've continued to play and record that song as it's easily one of my favorite songs from the earliest years of Death's career. The band did a good job constructing their setlist by including all of their catchiest and most memorable songs from that time while throwing in a fun cover for the audience to headbang to. \n\nI had mentioned how well the vocals sounded in this recording, and there is more to build off of that. For the majority of this demo Kam Lee took responsibility for lead vocals. Anybody who has listened to the Mantas/Death demos knows what his vocals from that era sounded like: a rather growly grunt. Starting from \"Beyond the Unholy Grave\" and ending with \"Power of Darkness,\" Chuck \"Evil Chuck\" Schuldiner assumed the responsibility for lead vocals. At the time of this demo being recorded, Chuck was only 17 years old. His age could be heard through his vocals. When compared to releases such as \"Back from the Dead,\" \"Mutilation,\" and anything released after that with Chuck on lead vocals, Chuck's vocals on this demo are rather under-developed. He did have the growls going on, but they lacked a substantial amount of abrasive grit. There were short gaps in between the growl vocals where the vocals became a little bit more tame, which then it could really be heard that Chuck was still a kid in this recording. Chuck also did some high screams, which just like the growls were under-developed. Nonetheless, Chuck had a decent starting point for his vocals to improve upon. The responsibility for handling lead vocals was returned to Kam Lee starting with \"Poison,\" and remained that way for the rest of the tape. Chuck could still be heard doing some backup vocals. Some notable examples being the choruses of \"Witch of Hell\" and \"Death by Metal.\"\n\nWith the exception of 2 songs, there isn't anything out of the ordinary with any of the songs that were played. Those 2 songs are \"Zombie\" and \"Corpse Grinder.\" On this demo, \"Zombie\" lacked the ominous instrumental intro riff that was present when the song was featured on Mantas's \"Live Tape #1\" demo and Death's \"Reign of Terror\" demo. Also, the band stopped during the middle of the song, and in place of what would be the remainder of it was a random guitar solo played by Chuck Schuldiner. As for \"Corpse Grinder,\" the lyrical structure of the song on this demo is vastly different than the \"Reign of Terror\" version. On this demo, Kam Lee rushed through the verse lyrics, which then left a lot of empty space during the verses that could've been filled with either more lyrics or just a better executed structure. This issue was corrected on the \"Reign of Terror\" version. As for the rest of the songs, there's nothing out of the ordinary as I said. The band played the songs exactly how they were known for being played. Sure, there may have been some songs that were played a little faster and had some rhythmic discrepancies between the guitars and drums, but that's not anything to get up in arms about. \n\nMantas really killed it with this performance and getting a good quality recording out of it. The band seemed well rehearsed, interacted with the audience very well, and truly left their mark upon the Florida death metal scene. This live demo is a neat relic that provides for an enjoyable listen. Favorite songs: Mantas, Evil Dead, Legion of Doom, Witch of Hell, and Slaughterhouse.\n",
        "\nWith the meteoric release of Human in 1991 and the subsequent misstep (to some) in Individual Thought Patterns, Death had something to prove in 1995. Could they get a hold of the wave of technical death metal that saw bands like Suffocation and Atheist rise to the top? Well, Chuck went back to the lab for two years, still partnered with Gene Hoglan, and decided to construct an earth-shattering classic that is essentially a shoe-in for top five in any death metal all time list.\n\nThe title track opens things up with a slow-burning riff that quickly escalates at various points in the song into a thrashy blitz, coated in Chuck\u2019s signature growl. He howls into the abyss about\u2026 something? Truth be told, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint the message he\u2019s trying to get across here but with how fantastic his vocal performance was on every album, it never really mattered. Whether it\u2019s about zombies or suicide, Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s vocals remain the best in the business.\n\nWhat drives this album the most is the diversity of riffs that Death will run through in a single song. \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d throws four or five different riffs at you in the two minutes, complete with the elegant pinch harmonics that always find their way into a song. And then come the solos, and wow does Chuck absolutely nail every single one. Whether he\u2019s injecting the occasional jazzy melody or just simply tearing up notes, there isn\u2019t a trite moment of guitar on this entire album. And as Chuck was eclipsing his most progressive era, the brevity of his work and the technicality of the instrumentation only grew.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find a song here that can\u2019t be stapled down as a classic, the otherworldly guitar licks on \u201cEmpty Words\u201d alone give it the status, but the pre-hook riff is just as good as any other Death has ever put on a record. It calls back to \u201cLeprosy\u201d at times, and to the untrained ear, they can come across as quite similar. But much like Keith Richards in classic rock, Chuck often operates in a specific wheelhouse, deviating slightly but always enough to give every riff he writes a distinct quality. The crawling power chords on the hook and the palm muting are just icing on the cake- this song is fucking perfect.\n\nThere\u2019s no sense in dissecting this album song for song, though that is a fine way to listen to it, it\u2019s best listened to as one composite masterpiece. Death incorporates influences from all spheres of metal: doom metal and shred have their shining moments if you listen carefully enough all over this thing. Soaring hooks and heavy, thrash-infused bridges are the key pleasures of this record. The band works incredibly well with contrast on numerous tracks, but the totality of each song seems to pull through as a piece that\u2019s greater than the sum of its parts (though those parts are pure platinum!).\n\nOh, and I couldn\u2019t forget \u201cCrystal Mountain.\u201d Arguably the greatest thrash song ever composed, this song alone runs through three of Death\u2019s best riffs throughout their entire discography. And this all happens before the greatest guitar solo in death metal history, each note being supercharged with emotive power. So there\u2019s that, if the A-side wasn\u2019t enough to convince you that this is on the Mt. Rushmore of death metal.\n",
        "\nSeems to be between Possessed '7 Churches' to Death's 'Scream Bloody Gore' where the conflict is which album founded the genre of death metal wholeheartedly? I'd have to say Death, especially well talked about on the Death By Metal documentary is that Possessed '7 Churches' was a bit \"sloppy\" and Death's 'Scream Bloody Gore' was \"tighter\". I'd have to agree with this synopsis. The music on here is raw, heavy and straightforward. Chuck did a great job on 3 avenues: vocals, guitar and bass Chris on drums. They practiced a shit-ton to get this album out and made. They had to go through some loopholes before finally making a recording on Combat.\n\nWhether this is your first experience with Death or not, one view is this: Chuck did not make any album sound the same. 'Leprosy' was close but you could hear from that recording the songwriting progression. And different lineup as Chris was let go of his drum duties handed over to Bill Andrews ('Leprosy' and 'Spiritual Healing'). They acquired Terry Butler on those 2 recordings also on bass. 'Scream Bloody Gore' is nothing polished but the sound wasn't so raw that you couldn't make out the guitar riffs. And as Jim Morris from Morrisound Recordings says \"Chuck is talking to you in the riffs.\" You'd better believe that!\n\nThe album itself is about 45 minutes and it's just brutal. Chris wanted to stay in the band but Chuck was already moving on. A lot of death metal bands keep producing the same records over and over, Chuck wanted to progress as a musician. So he never really fit that mold to playing death metal exclusively throughout his musical career. This album set the tone for other death metal bands like Morbid Angel, Deicide, Malevolent Creation, et al to move into this category. I think that the fact that he always thought \"metal is metal\" and it shouldn't follow in categories which now there are numerous categories of metal. He was opposed to these \"categories.\"\n\nThese guys practiced and practiced for this to get made and out to listeners. What to expect in addition to what I said: \"Zombie Ritual\", what a great song! It's fast, it's catchy, but like all the songs on here. Other people have commented that this album is \"boring\" and just the same thing over and over. But those are the people who aren't really listening. The production isn't the best, but it was good enough for Combat and even though this album was initially turned down, they found someone that could put in the time to make the recording even though he didn't know what the band members talked about in this genre (Courtesy of Death By Metal documentary). Check it out!\n",
        "\nHeavy AS FUCK! This is the beginning to Death's musical evolution in music. Pretty much a new lineup every recording (with exceptions). I had this album on cassette and later bought the CD to capture it on my stereo. Most people don't operate out of a stereo anymore, but not me! It gives 'Leprosy' better audio (to me). This album is heavy like I said but catchy. 'Scream Bloody Gore' was the beginning of death metal, better (in my opinion) than Possessed's 'Seven Churches'. And 'Leprosy' is another evolution to Death's music. Safe to say here this is the band that began death metal itself, arguably though.\n\nThis album the whole way through has great songs filled with Chuck's songwriting and lyrical concepts. The music fit the lyrics perfectly. But you see that he's getting away from the \"gore\" in his songs and putting more effort into the words. Rick Rozz adds a different element to the lead department, a lot of whammy bar solos that complement the music, ABSOLUTELY. Even though I like all Death releases, the earlier stuff namely this one is creative and innovative. But as time went on and lineups/musical direction changed Death turned from death metal to more progressive metal. Hence, moving forward to Control Denied and Death's main man Chuck died in 2001.\n\nThe vocals on this album go perfect with the songs (music). Rick brought a new element to Death, but not good enough for what Chuck's direction was going towards. Obviously, Rick was probably disappointed with his removal from the band going towards Massacre (his formed band). I don't think that this album really had many flaws, hence the perfect score. The music, leads, vocals, production and mixing all went through really well. I couldn't ask for a better Death release. They did better than fine here. I'm surprised it took me so long to write about this one, maybe it's bringing it out of the archives and revisiting the sounds.\n\nI say, BUY THE ALBUM. If you're into CD's or Vinyl, better yet. This is Chuck playing raw but not so much as on 'Scream Bloody Gore'. It's in my opinion, better than their debut. Definitely, so this is the beginning of movement all across the board with Carcass, Obituary, Deicide, et al. This big move into the real heavy stuff thanks to Chuck. Even if people say Possessed is responsible for this rise in death metal I say no Chuck's band was responsible for the early rise in this genre. But what later happens, is the musical direction towards a more melodic sound. Leprosy is vintage death metal galore! Check it out!\n",
        "\nDeath is credited by many as being the band that originated death metal. While its creator and front man Chuck Schuldiner disagreed with this sentiment, Death is certainly one of the genres main influences, and multiple Death albums paved the way for other bands in some way or another. Its debut album Scream Bloody Gore in 1987 was very thrash influenced, but particularly dark and intense at the time of its release, with very tongue-in-cheek horror-based lyrics. The follow up Leprosy in 1988 increased the intensity while providing catchier songs and more memorable riffs, and to this day is considered by many one of the best 80's death metal albums. Never one to be stagnant in approach, Chuck decided to combine the intensity of the first two albums with melodic soloing, technical riffs, and odd time signatures, resulting in 1990's Spiritual Healing. It was this album that proved to other bands that death metal could have an abundance of melody in the solos and technique without betraying the genre. \n\nSome time after Leprosy was released, Death's other guitarist Rick Rozz was fired by Chuck due to personal issues between them. Chuck had said in interviews afterward that Rick was a horrible guitarist that held the rest of the band back, and other former members of Death said that Chuck was over Rick's obsession with Kerry King-style whammy bar solos. Now I like Rick Rozz and think his style of soloing really fit with Death's first two albums, but he was the only Death guitarist in its many line-up changes that was not better than or even on Chuck's level, so his departure was for the best. Replacing Rozz, James Murphy (pre-Obituary/Testament) was brought in to help finish the songwriting for the second half of Spiritual Healing that Chuck had already written with bassist Terry Butler. Murphy's inclusion was the best lineup addition that Chuck ever made, as not only was he a technically better guitarist than Chuck, but his unique sound and solos complemented his better than any of Death's other guitarists on later albums. \n\nThe duo of Chuck and James is Death's best guitar lineup, and Chuck's vocals are also at its peak. They're the deepest they'll get in the entire Death discography and also at its most clear, with everything being understandable while intense at the same time. It makes sense that vocal clarity was a focus for Chuck on this album, as it is the first one where the lyrics cover Chuck's views on reality - social issues, corruption, abortion, topics that people can relate to. I've heard people say that his lyrics weren't as mature as on later albums, but personally I find the lyrics to the point without being pretentious as some of the later albums' lyrics could get at times. Terry Butler's bass work serves to follow the guitars, and Bill Andrews, while no Gene Hoglan or Richard Christy, puts in some more variety on this album than in the previous works. The only issue with the drums are that they are mixed too high in the original release, but this is rectified in the 2012 Relapse reissue and is one reason why the reissue is better. \n\nThere are so many great songs on this album that it is hard to choose favorites. The intro track \"Living Monstrosity\" is a great combo of the technical solos, fast riffs and slow breakdown in the middle. \"Altering the Future\" has a lot of odd time signatures and showcases the band's evolution in songwriting towards a more technical approach. The title track \"Spiritual Healing\" is Death's longest song at 8 minutes, which begins with a signature Chuck-style tapping that goes into a slow breakdown and follows with multiple riffs. \"Killing Spree\" is a to the point, intense song reminiscent of Death's first two albums with one of the best solos. \"Low Life\" has a minute-long solo trade off with three solos each by James and Chuck that are the best n Death's discography and highlighted how well they fed off each other. \"Genetic Reconstruction\" is probably the catchiest song on the album, especially when Chuck is belting out \"Genetic reconstruction! Evolution in production!\"\n\nSpiritual Healing is unfortunately often looked over as being just a transition from the popular Leprosy into the equally or more popular Human, but it is so much better than that. Comparing Spiritual Healing with Human side by side, the former is equally as technical, except instead of jazzy elements it instead contains more of the OSDM sound. This album has all the technicality and melody that would characterize every later Death release and deserves much more recognition for it. Despite being introduced to Death with their final album The Sound of Perseverance, I find myself listening to Spiritual Healing the most. I enjoy the old school Death sound as well as the proggier sound of later Death, and this album contains the best of both worlds. Anyone that rates this album toward the bottom of Death's discography, well, I would have to guess that they never really listened to it and just feel like they need to play it safe by mimicking what's considered popular.\n",
        "\nNow, in a rather anticlimactic fashion, I\u2019m going to spoil the verdict of this review right off the bat: Death\u2019s Leprosy is the greatest metal album of all time, full stop. While I could just refuse to elaborate further and leave it as is, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a review. Rather, I\u2019m going to start gushing about how good this album is, and its importance to my journey as a metal fan.\n\nInstead of boring you with details about Death\u2019s history (death metal pioneers, tech and prog innovators, yadda yadda), I\u2019m going to bore you with how I got into them. A few years ago, I used to often go on car rides with my cousin, who was big into metal and always had music playing whenever he was driving. While most of it was heavy alternative music, there were a handful of extreme metal bands that, while admittedly surface level, made an impression on me. Among said bands was Death, more specifically their last two albums, Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance (because apparently the production on the early stuff was bad). Following that, I immediately started a deep dive in their discography, which inevitably led me to the topic of this review, an album that has just refused to leave my head ever since I first listened to it.\n\nThey say first impressions are the most important, and Leprosy makes an extremely strong one right from the get-go. It sounds sick, but not in a blood-caked Severed Survival sense, it\u2019s more like a miasma hovering over the music itself. The recording is steeped in this impenetrable atmosphere despite that not being the music\u2019s main focus. The guitars have this satisfying crunch to them that\u2019s nicely supplemented by the bass plonking away underneath, and the drums are just relentless. All that is supported by a grimy, but audible, mix that lets all the instruments be heard at all times.\n\nI would be remiss not to bring up Chuck\u2019s vocal performance. While the man is primarily known for being a guitar god (more on that later), his vocal performance on the earlier albums is also worth discussing. His ghoulish mid-range growl has been one of the defining characteristics of the band\u2019s early output. It was arguably one of the most important ingredients to the aforementioned atmosphere, along with the lyrics. While they might seem pass\u00e9e by today\u2019s standards, they were quite influential to how most death metal bands that followed approached lyrics. Death, disease and violence were the themes that defined an entire genre, and Death in particular managed to pen lyrics that, despite their inherent brutishness, were still quite well put together and catchy. There\u2019s not a single chorus here that misses, seriously.\n\nWhile all those characteristics do play a great part in why the album is as perfect as it is, the main thing in a music review is, well, the music. Death has always been known for changing between albums, and this one is no different. Leprosy was a step away from the thrashier flavours of Scream Bloody Gore and was basically one of the first \u201cpure\u201d death metal albums. It\u2019s chock full of blistering and crushing riffs, all of which make it a great challenge to pick a single favourite track, though there are a few that by some miracle stand above the rest. The gnarly title track immediately sets the stage with its introduction and headbangable rhythms, and from that point forward the album just doesn\u2019t let up. The songs are just raw and primal, and that can be felt in the sheer ugliness of songs like the groovy \u201cBorn Dead'' and the almost-doom \u201cPull the Plug\u201d, the latter of which might just be the best song they\u2019ve ever penned. It\u2019s genuinely stunning how much awesomeness they managed to cram into every single second of this album, you have to listen to it in order to believe it.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, Leprosy is the greatest metal album of all time. It serves as a landmark and a prime example of what the genre can be, and it hasn\u2019t aged a bit since the day I first listened to it. Not only that, but the album has proven to be timeless, and the passage of time has been extremely kind to it. I implore you to listen to this album if you somehow haven\u2019t done so already, it\u2019s not just essential metal listening, but essential music listening.\n\nHighlights: Yes.\n",
        "\n\"Human\" is, arguably, the most iconic of all Death's albums, the one most often remembered and praised by its virtues and for how influential it was. It marked a passage not entirely surprising from a more conspicuous, trademark old school death metal to a more elaborated, refined brand of extreme music, harboring elements of progressive music all the way. \"Spiritual Healing\" already hinted some of the content here provided, yet this album remarkably diverges from its predecessor. I am an avid defender of experimentation, leaps of faith and bold moves on music. Bands shouldn't be creatively shackled by any means. But I also advocate for cohesive change rather than abrupt, precipitate ones. Chuck will hit and miss a few more times on his road ahead, but this beginning of sorts is not short of bumps, maybe out of inexperience. Well, it couldn't be for lack of talent of any of the people involved. Chuck needs no introductions at this point, being the chairman of this ambitious outfit and, as much as the previous collaborators he worked with perfectly thrived on their ends, the guys he assembled for \"Human\" are just too far ahead. For the bass, he enlisted Steve Di Giorgio, at the time somewhat anonymous, and to the lead guitar and drums, respectively, Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert, both from Cynic. For the latter two guys, the amount of contribution is not only derived from their outstanding performances, but also from the musical approach of their own band. If you listen to Cynic's 1991 demo, you'll realize how strikingly similar it is to Human. Which reminds me: let's focus a little more on the music itself. \n\n\"Flattening of Emotions\", the song that starts the show, is quite exemplary of what to expect next on so, if you like or not the way thing sounds here, might as well be a warning for what you should be preparing for. It's a strong song overall, with a few bright ideas both musically and lyrically. It also stands for a fair demonstration of some well known Death archetypes and also some of the new dishes the chef was cooking. The aftertaste is a little too bittersweet in my mouth, though. I mean, there are some great riffs here, but as far as song structure goes, it's really all over the place, with no real definition or essence. There are too many passages or sections, each one with its own brand of riffs and instrumental work. The problem is many of these sections are just dull and overly forgettable, with no real purpose to be there, except to fulfill some ambition of turning the song into a progressive piece, by any means necessary. Another thing that bothers me about this layout is the fact that these sections do not link with each other organically. You're listening to some part of the track and then you're abruptly switched to another branch without a clue. While more \"sophisticated\" or intricate, this approach don't really click with me on this album(or most albums whatsoever). Maybe it's less noticeable to most people just because the awesome groundwork laid down by such talented musicians is a little mesmerizing. At the time, specially, because we're talking about 1991 and a still crawling genre of music, there certainly was an ever bigger impression. \n\nThe only songs where I felt gripped all the way through were \"Lack of Comprehension\", \"Cosmic Sea and \"Vacant Planets\". I mean, the first half of the album isn't half bad(pun intended), but the fillers amidst the other great riffs and well executed ideas really wore me out. On the second half, with the exception of \"See Through Dreams\", that is plagued mainly by the same reason of the previous songs, the music is more enjoyable and really sticks out as something I can remember after listening. \"Lack of Comprehension\" might even be my favorite song by the band. It was also the very first proper hit of these guys, with the release of a video clip and all. The riffs, Chuck's vocals and the lyrics are the more inspired the band felt on this album. Cosmic Sea has a very space-horror vibe to it and the instruments really shine here. It was the first instrumental track by the band and a pretty good idea, since we have a stellar team aboard. There are a lot of emotional catches and the ethereal synth in the background really attunes the mood. \"Vacant Planets\" is a pretty strong closing track, with a better paced dynamic that reminds me of the better things from the band's past. \n\nIn fact, I had to listen to this album for many years in order to convey the opinions I now expose here. It seems a little unfair or pedantic to harshly criticize a work that, otherwise, delivers what it's meant to. But I also don't think I should encourage a platonic, far-fetched praise over a considerably flawed record. I mean, the band could do more with what they had. I don't mean to point out how someone should do their jobs, but by overlapping good music with pretentious intent of doing \"progressive\" music, I think Chuck really missed the point. It doesn't' help much that the production also decreased the overall \"death\" mood to a safer-to-approach kind of art. It's less menacing, less powerful and, as such, just loses itself in some limbo with under-cooked ideas. Also, the lyrics are good, but I think that those from Spiritual Healing were more intelligent, overall. \n\nI have to highlight that this album is fairly enjoyable and a good piece of music, as much as it may wrongly seem that I hate it. It is just that the global evolution of this band really could have driven them on to a better direction.\n",
        "\nThis album is a closure for Death, but also a start of sorts. From Human onward, the depth of the musical structure and varying tempo will radically differ from the band's three first outputs, but Spiritual Healing already has much more in store for your brain than the previous albums did. Leprosy was already ahead of SBG by some miles, but SH is quite another leap into experimentation, with an even more intricate formation, doing what they do best with great chemistry. It also feels like Chuck has seen all that darkness and death had to offer in the two first LPs, but then he realizes that the material world we live in is just as fucked up, hence the theme that conceptualize the entire album.\n\nKeeping the tradition, the album starts with a menacing intro track, which is arguably one of the best here. Living Monstrosity introduces the listener to the world of madness and dismay that Chuck seemingly wanted to conceive. The lyrics are, as is the case throughout the record, much more mature and wise than everything he's done before. There are many things that even feel quite up to date, resonating many aspects of our daily misery with the usual brutality. The first song is also a brief glimpse into the great guitar work presented, maybe not the most memorable, even in comparison to Leprosy, but spectacularly well-constructed. The only real complaint i have is that Chuck's growls, made in the same awesome style of the previous album, is frequently plagued by unnecessary electronic effects. It doesn't actually gives the songs any real onus, since they still sound fearsome and mighty, specially with the higher-quality production overall, but this annoying gimmick is very noticeable. \n\nThe other lesser demerit this album has is what i stated on the summary. Some of the tracks here, specially the title-track, needed to be more cleaned up. There are filler moments that don't benefit the song and only bore you after a while. Spiritual Healing is still one of the best songs in this album, which only makes me wonder how more efficient of a hit it would be if edited properly. A more clever approach, though, comes with Defensive Personalities, two tracks prior. It has the great momentum and fun of the title track, but does not overstays its welcome at all. It has one of my favorite Death's riffs ever, one that comes between the chorus verses. It's evil as fuck, even if more simple and straightforward. \nMost of the other tracks function well, even if many are not as memorable, but there's still Killing Spree, an amazing ending to this work. It features a very enjoyable intro and encompasses a lot of neck-breaking riffs like we always hope for. The title surely checks out. \n\nI talked about the great chemistry of this formation, but i need to scrutinize further. James Murphy does a hell of a job in here. It's almost impossible to point out who is the best guitar player the band ever had, other than Chuck himself, but Murphy is a really fierce contender to the top. His leads in this album and the way his play style heavily complements Chuck's are really outstanding. Terry Butler also does a great job, after two albums where Chuck was the bass player, but he's no Di Giorgio, of course. And Bill Andrews, which was already pretty solid on Leprosy, makes a hell of a performance and departs from the band at his peak. Two of these guys(Butler and Andrews) were/would be part of Massacre, which was kind of a rival to Death(although unfair, because they only released a single great album), while Murphy played on Obituary, even being a part of one of their best records ever. \n\nAll in all, while there's much to debate whether this album goes up to the Top 3 of the band or something like that, it really redefines the band's approach in a important way and also presents us some lyrical content that is mostly flawless on the larger scope of the Floridian outfit. I used to overlook this record a lot in the past, but i ask all of you to never do so.\n",
        "\nBy 1998, many thought that death metal had reached its pinnacle. Bands like Cannibal Corpse, Suffocation, Autopsy, and countless others had released classic albums, but there was one band that was there at its inception that continued to build a legendary discography: Death. They pushed the limits into progressive territory (though some will argue that Atheist beat them to the punch), and routinely released the best batch of guitar work and songwriting in the genre. This all culminated with their final two releases, specifically, The Sound of Perseverance. \n\nThis record has probably the finest guitar performance in all of death metal. The acoustic flourishes are placed into the album with care, not just space-filler. The riffs on \"A Moment of Clarity\" and \"Spirit Crusher\" are intricate, clean, and catchy; the latter having probably the most ear worm riff in all of metal after the bridge. The solos on this album are consistently fast-paced, memorable, and very creative. Chuck Schuldiner seemed to always have tricks left up his sleeve, even after the \"Crystal Mountain\" solo was applauded as the apex. But the electric wailing on \"Voice of the Soul\" and the multi-tempo cries on \"To Forgive Is to Suffer\" are pure emotion being poured out of Chuck's guitar. For how many different bands had attacked death metal by the late 'nineties, it's amazing that Death was still able to pull ahead as the best, even being well over a decade into their careers.\n\nBut the guitar isn't the only instrument that Chuck lets shine on this record. Take, for example, the random (but appreciated) injection of pace around the 4:00 mark on \"To Forgive Is to Suffer,\" where Richard Christy's drumming takes the spotlight and runs away with it. His drumming is also the driving force behind the Judas Priest cover of \"Painkiller,\" a track that truly rivals the original and even transcends it in terms of aggression (though the album of the same name by Priest is a speed/thrash classic worth checking out!). As the closer to this album, it feels like a perfect send off to not just the record but to Death's career, a career that constantly paid homage to other greats in metal with the vast array of influences that colored their music. The Sound of Perseverance is arguably the greatest example of this: there are hints of thrash, the death metal vocals that Chuck perfected on every Death release, but the theatricality of power metal and prog elements of Dream Theater or Fates Warning in the songwriting. \n\nThe lyrics are consistently insightful and even bone-chilling, like on the hook of \"Bite the Pain\" or on \"Flesh and the Power It Holds,\" the album's longest cut that cycles through numerous rhythm and riff changes. The album opener, \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow,\" is a great tone setter for the record as well, given how consistent the theme of this album is. The guitar tone doesn't change too much, and the songs never wander into overly-aggressive territory. They're well-written (probably due in part to the three year break between albums, the longest of their career) and don't dip too deeply into the prog-death metal scene. They experiment with some funky drum patterns like on \"Spirit Crusher,\" but the majority of the tune is still riff-based. Overall, the band does an amazing job of pulling from a bunch of different influences and shaping them into catchy, complex, and crafty death metal songs. This is Death's peak as a band, and although it may not symbolize such a peak for the genre, it certainly remains in contention.\n",
        "\nOk, now that's more like it, people. While Scream Bloody Gore was, to me, the fundamental start of all a genre, some of its tracks didn't quite age well and were still very reminiscent of some kinds of thrash metal widely practiced at the time. Such is not the case with Leprosy, on my account. As much as it's ultimately less brutal and hostile than its predecessor, it consolidates more clearly the difference between a brutal thrash record and a true death metal one. SBG was a death metal album with all due credits, but Leprosy redefines the style uniqueness, while also being way more refined and packing a lot more talent. Many of the things that made Death a quintessential band, widely revered by the god-tier musicianship and songwriting, were already well shown in here. In fact, one of the first differences people could notice from the previous album to this one is the guitar leads showing up way more often and with greater technique. Also, by adding up a second guitar player and bringing a more technical drummer, Chuck had a better layout to work with, while also given more room to expand on his own musical gift. His vocals, for instance, are way better and more mature, with growls that actually reminded me of John Tardy, but in a fashion of his own and with much less of that funny zombie-like thing only Tardy can do.\n\nAdding up to that, the riffs are even better than before, more memorable and packing a lot of punch. I couldn't even tell you some finer examples of great riffs at display, because i think each and every song on this record has its share of wise, catchy riffing. There's also the trademark that made SBG a fine album, which is mixing up both doom-like, low-tempo passages with more relentless, speedy phrases down the road. In here, though, the better songwriting make this junction flow more organically and, well, i really banged my head way harder during the faster passages, because all the instruments together created quite an addictive symphony of horror and chaos. The diversity should also be noted as a bonus factor of quality. While many songs on the debut album seemed very similar to each other, Leprosy has much more uniqueness on a larger scope, while each song has its own meddle of different and memorable passages as well. \n\nThematically, Leprosy is very derivative of its predecessor. It's heavily inclined to that pure horror fashion like we picture when thinking of good old B-movies. But the lyrics are way more clever this time, while Chuck's vocals are more refined and, as such, carry on the lyrical arrangement with better technique and pronounce clarity. The cover artwork is also very well-designed and more sophisticated. Hell, i love SBG's cover, i even have a T-shirt with it printed, but Leprosy's cover is less edgy and more intriguing. The color palette also needs to be pointed out. It really adds up to the overall eeriness, but in a cleaner, classy way. \n\nThere are only two things i could condone that the debut album has that this one doesn't. It's not as redefining and revolutionary, on a larger scale, even if it's very important for the band itself, raising the quality bar and bringing strong musicianship development. Also, it's a safer approach to extreme metal, with less potency and raw brutality. But both these things do not make me feel less inclined to say, with all words, that Leprosy is a better record on its own. Being revolutionary is a very occasional thing on music. It takes more than just talent of overall quality, it's a limited event more depending on the circumstances, sometimes even luck. As for the \"safety\", i guess it could also be said that Chuck and his crew found out a better working formula, with much more room for musical enhancement. It doesn't have the same vivid energy of the predecessor, but it opens way more doors to experimentation and innovation, broadening up the possibilities that this once infant genre could venture on. Overall, it really shows us the better side of Chuck's ingenuity and already brings some of his very best compositions to date.\n",
        "\nWhile a lot has been said about Possessed's Seven Churches, or even the demo which is rigthfully called Death Metal, whenever i listen to those, i picture First Wave Black Metal with a little more raw passion, like a Venom on steroids. Not that any of this labeling thing functions in detriment of any band, also totally not being the case with Possessed and its magnificent debut, but i think Death's first full-length really takes the genre to its fundamental starting point. Both albums are actually very similar to some extent, the vocals being the most obvious stance(Chuck was admittedly very influenced by Jeff Becerra), but i find that Scream Bloody Gore really mutates their primal references into an ugly, manifested zombie nightmare, full of disemboweled corpses and psychopathic hatred. Possessed, in the other hand, is much more akin to the satanic, Venom-esque way of doing things, one of the reasons i compared the two bands previously. \n\nThe album begins with a very appropriate musical reference to me. Infernal Death's intro is that kind of sluggish, haunting theme that reminds me of Black Sabbath's eponymous song. While the latter started the whole heavy metal thing mostly by fate, Chuck Schuldiner is now conceiving the rite of passage into death metal pits. In fact, the first two tracks are really catchy, straightforward death metal tunes. Zombie Ritual, specially, shows up some of the still uncovered god-tier musicianship of the band's mentor. He was also the songwriter, lyricist and bass player for this album, the only other thing being the drums, which were played by Chris Reifert, the legendary singer and drummer of Autopsy and other acts. To me, though, only the guitar and vocals are really impressive and groundbreaking, but i guess that Reifert's relentless drumming was also a very welcome pounding at that time. It's just that, compared to some other guys who commanded the kit for ulterior Death''s albums, his performance sounded a little lackluster to me, the exception being the slower parts, where he shines more effectively. The very same thing can be said about the bass, which is heavy and very present but not memorable.\n\nThe songs are all pretty similar in structure and lyrical theme. They are, by far, the most simplistic Death ever put out, specially on the lyrics' side, but i don't guess that's something bad to point out. The album was conceived as this 70's trash movie tribute and both the songwriting and lyrics work really well on showing that. And, because context is a mandatory element on all arts, we gotta remember how terribly influential all the musical decisions here made were at the time. Not a single gore/death band would skip this record, it was a major blueprint to how they would and should sound. It would even be unfair or anachronistic to see things otherwise, because that Death from later albums was a project more oriented to a different kind of approach into music, leaning towards proggy and melodic metal. After all, Chuck was the sole captain of this ship and he was intentionally sailing to other lands, of which we know more from Control Denied's music. \n\nOf course that, standing from this point in time, the review being written on the last sighs of 2021, many other death metal records have surpassed Scream Bloody Gore for miles. Even Death itself had a steap ascension from Leprosy onwards. But hell, this is a 1987 record, in a time when such things were not done this way. Apart from some brilliant moments, even predicting some of the band's more intricate, complex songwriting of the future, i don't think there's anything that absurdly good about Scream Bloody Gore, but i'll still give it a pretty beefy score because of how fucking important it was and still is.\n",
        "\n\"Individual Thought Patterns\" was my first Death album, and one of the first death metal albums I ever bought. Looking back, this might have marked the point when I stopped \u2018orbiting\u2019 death metal and got sucked into its gravitational field. I purchased this record when it came out. I remember seeing the video for \"The Philosopher\" on late night TV and liking the imagery as well as the song. It is important to have a few cornerstone records from your childhood where you can say \u201cI was there\u201d. I was a fraction too young for the original death metal scene in its prime, but 1993 was when I started paying attention to metal bands beyond the obvious ones. Records like this were not mainstream, but they were easy enough to find in record shops in provincial towns, such as my own. \n\nI played this one to death, no pun intended. I know almost every word of these songs because my teenage sponge/brain absorbed the lyrics in a way that no adult brain can hope to replicate. Nowadays, this is still one of the Death albums I return to. It isn't my favourite of their albums, but it has plenty of depth and catchiness. I would argue that it is a more subtle record than either of the two albums that straddle it (\"Human\" and \"Symbolic\"). Chuck Schuldiner was joined by three new guys who were unknown to me at the time, but are easy to recognise in retrospect. The three previous guys from \"Human\" had gone (and were recording \u201cFocus\u201d of course). They were replaced by Andy LaRocque from Mercyful Fate on lead, bassist Steve DiGiorgio from Sadus, and ex-Dark Angel drummer Gene Hoglan. There are no weak links here. \n\nThe musicianship is predictably brilliant. Every song has a highlight solo or a jaw-dropping bass-line. What is most impressive is that Schuldiner didn\u2019t forget how to write songs. Most of these have stomping, invective-driven choruses. The likes of \"Trapped in a Corner\" and \"Mentally Blind\" have plenty of challenging rhythms and sharp melodies, but always come back to a central hook. Chuck\u2019s guiding principle seems to have been that song-writing should come first, with musical embellishments second. This is the same philosophy that Rush had had on \"Moving Pictures\" (which must have been an influence). In Chuck's hands, this philosophy results in a claustrophobic, intense record that never lets up. The melodies here are full of emotional catharsis. I feel that Chuck\u2019s contributions to melodic death metal are a little underrated, given that this album was released before \"Heartwork\" and \"Terminal Spirit Disease\". \n\nMusicianship and song-writing aside, this album is tied together by anger. There is little ambiguity in any of these lyrics. Chuck seems to have been pissed off with everything. Each song is a withering critique of something or someone. This makes for some memorable lyrics, many of which are extended over two or more lines (e.g., \"What would you do without your pathetic narrow-minded approach to life, that reflects your lack of abilities?\" or \"In time, you will find yourself trapped in a corner. These four words my friend, I promise you will not forget.\"). Chuck wanted his enemies to know who they were. The intensity of the album comes from the feeling that Chuck may be judging you, the listener. As a young teenager seeking guidance from elders, these kinds of lyrics can have a profound effect. The message equates to something like: \u201cdon\u2019t be a dick\u201d. This is good life advice.\n\nI am glad that \"Individual Thought Patterns\" exists. This has been an important record for me since I bought it. There is a reason why it has stayed in my rotation ever since. The production is vibrant in a way that you don\u2019t always associate with Morrisound (although the studio had plenty of expertise with death metal by 1993). I prefer this production to the relative muddiness of \"Human\", and to the technicolor approach of \"Symbolic\". This might be the chief reason why I listen to this album more often than either of those. Overall, I can\u2019t say that \u201cIndividual Thought Patterns\u201d is the best Death album; \u201cNothing is Everything\u201d is a dud, \u201cOut of Touch\u201d is the only fast song, and the first two albums were more important and more bludgeoning. Still, it is good. This is the album where Chuck's emotions were laid bare, so take heed.\n",
        "\nIt's 1994. Chuck Schuldiner goes nuts and decides he's an art metal practitioner now. He surrounds himself with some of the top company in metal around at the time, recruiting the legendary Gene Hoglan on drums and sets off on a quest to make Death as further sounding as it had been to the darker (and equally better) days of 'Leprosy'. The previous 'Human' had already come across as unnecessarily progressive; like the prog element was noticeably forced into the tracks; but this one takes it to a whole new level.\n\nThis album so clearly sounds like a band that just wanted to explore the progressive world, just for the heck of it, with no real project of exactly how they were going to tackle it and how it is that they were going to make Death and pure prog work cohesively. The songs are hardly songs for the most part. They are archives of riffs and leads. In short, they're drawn out jam sessions. Which would've been fine had this been some sort of Death exhibition gig with each musician contributing an intriguing part and fans grooving to the live jazz-like ambiance of improvisation and spontaneous interpretation. But this is a full length studio record, i.e. the final product that the band had years to put together, correct, move parts a different place, remove or add, restructure...until they got what ought to be songs worthy of that name.\n\nIt's ironic and telling in an odd way that the album is actually called \"Individual thought patterns\", the emphasis being of the first word. It's like the band in a way knew how disjointed this thing was and gave it, merely subconsciously of course, the derogatory name it rightfully deserved - but that's just an aside.\n\nThe problem is of course not just form related, it is as much content related. A random listen to most riffs on this should give an indication as to what the band are trying to do, and what they aren't trying to do: write memorable riffs that'll last through the ages. The whole point of such an endeavor is to enjoy the plurality of goods offered by the band. It is more like a buffet with ordinary dishes yet served up in amounts plenty enough to send the client into a frenzy: they won't remember specifically how good the sausages were nor the desserts or anything else really, they will just reminisce fondly about how much of it there was. Which some would say in the case of metal music, is fair enough. Only it isn't, because there's no possible excuse for writing trite riffs, ever. It doesn't matter that there are 18 riffs and leads per song - nothing justifies writing mediocre material for a full length release.\n\nJust listen to (the ridiculously named) 'Nothing is everything' and that fare-like lead they dared to play about a minute into the song. What is going on there: was Schuldiner hired to play at some kid's birthday earlier and brought that into this record ? And while you're at it, on that part get a load of those fretless (and tireless) bass guitar farts in the background. Virtuosic bassists in metal are rare enough to be celebrated, but at which point is low end flatulence just too much ? The guy is proficient, we get it. Just a tad more attack maybe, before the bass sounds like a permanent background buildup clog in the mix ?\n\nAnd the riffs are -always- the same darn thing with prog Death, aren't they ? It's like finding the usual culprits in every subsequent album. Those riffs that stink of metal stereotype that the band seemingly couldn't live without, like they were addicted to them. Of course this is the same Schuldiner who wrote those earlier albums and some riffs on here are strong; an example of this being the intro and main riff off the last track 'The Philosopher', reminiscent of good old Death with a renewed dynamism to it, until the track inevitably relapses into the album's addictive ills. Some riffs are simply awful with how basic and unimaginatively put together they are and it would take a genuine effort of indulgence for the band to find any true value there. As the listener, you have to get into it because it surely won't come and grab you like great albums do.\n\nThere's such a flatness to the music. It feels like it's living out its own self-indulgent expedition into prog land, while forgetting all about where it was headed with any hindsight, and thus abandoning the notion of self-criticism entirely. How fitting is it that there's a track on here called 'Out of touch'.\n",
        "\nWhat always struck me as odd with the band Death and Schuldiner as a song-writer is the disparity in quality throughout one same album. This doesn't apply to the earlier darker death metal incarnation of the band so much as it is the scourge of Death in their prog period. There's a weird sort of tentative feel about the songs here, like they're often holding back and unwisely take the route of stubborn progressiveness. Whether Schuldiner had any real business writing progressive music at all is a serious question considering some of the material developed on an album like this one. \n\nSome parts are absolutely inspired, with real drive and powerful forward momentum. An easy example of that is the first track, 'Flattening of emotions', at least on the heavier parts: a cohesive continuity from riff to riff and that contagious drive. Riffs that are utterly focused on the task of being grin-provoking death metal and couldn't possibly suffer from any identity crisis. In fact it's a bit of a theme that whenever Death write their heavier stuff they're immediately a different tier from whenever they turn melodic or force a progressive feel into the tracks. Those sinister palm muted tremolo picking sections with the double kicks locked in, like death itself crawling towards the listener, are bang on the money. They're reminiscent of old Death, they're death metal and ominous, and they are done well. Good stuff. But then they'll stitch that up with some sort of caricature of what progressive music is perceived to sound like if it were implemented by someone outside the genre, suddenly fancying giving it a shot. It's experimental at best, and hardly mature enough musically to qualify as \"all-time classic\".\n\nThe prog thing is so bad it'll often sound like the music turns aimless, if not nearly soulless. At times it practically sounds like the band are going into intermission and just play these parts to keep some sound going, to fill in the space, which is exactly what average prog rock/metal will sound like. \nThe melodic moments are a little bit cringey: the old 'playing Iron Maiden riffs in a heavier setting' wasn't novel, and even if it were, it would've sounded cool for a second before eroding quickly. Offering melodic riffs that borrow the basic binary system of two root note switching and whatever random dabble for a melody underneath, and doing it with so little invention and settling for an almost textbook example of it each time, really doesn't help lift the album composition wise and certainly serves as no worthy counter to the heavier vicious death metal on the other end. The melodic part on 'Flattening' is so close to the one on 'Lack of comprehension', it's quite a bit silly that both would be on the same album. Like there are no other conceivable formulas for creating melodic riffs.\n\nOf course this is Death and since 'Leprosy' from back in 1988 they've benefited from fantastic sound production that was always years ahead of its time given this is death metal, or at least in this case, an album that merely contains death metal elements. This isn't exactly brimming with blast beats, gurgly deep growls, or twisted/technical/rapid riffs like what Suffocation or Morbid Angel and company were doing at the time. Which must be understood as the band having that plan from the start to make metal that, while retaining some of its underground vibes, would be simple and spaced out enough so as to get a clean, polished sounding result during the recording. They always wanted to make the music obvious to a degree. And it does sound quite gorgeous. Schuldiner's vocals sound superb here, and he does put in a strong performance but it seems Morrisound Studios had a bit to do with that, versus other extreme bands that sound like they got produced in basements. \n\nThe chronic problem on this is the parts that sound the best are often the most clich\u00e9 and boring: those grand, atmospheric suspended power chords with some kind of a predictable lead; that trite, conservative use of harmonic minor, the \"middle-eastern scale\"; or worse yet, when it's time for the obligatory demonstrative guitar solo that actually get more tedious as the record progresses. After being served a mitigated cluster of tracks with redundant tendencies within songs and what feels like a bit of a trivial experience really if one looks past the gaudy production and the occasional \"real Death\" moments, along comes an instrumental track - 'Cosmic Semen' ... or was it 'Cosmic Sea' perhaps - and it's that same banal, underwhelming aftertaste. There's a bit of promise, and then that flatness again, like the music isn't taking off as it should and there's too little on display there.\n\nAll in all it appears this album's goal was to dazzle listeners with a wide array of moods and textures, all through the imposing prism of the outstanding production, provided the listeners got so overwhelmed by the sound and the eclectic dynamics of the album they would be kept busy and satisfied, while glossing over the fine print on the contract - which isn't as thrilling when given a closer look. Only it isn't enough to merely juxtapose a couple of genres, like the concept itself is a job well done. The artists have to be experienced and adept at writing in both styles. A fan of dark metal will probably get off on this. A death metal fan may, or may not as I refer back to a lack of extremity here (no blasts, no growls, etc...). But then, and I can't speak for every prog fan in the world but I'd imagine the average prog-head wouldn't immediately think of the album 'Human' or the band Death more broadly when the notion of \"great prog music\" is evoked. Which wouldn't be the case with other crossover metal bands like, say, Opeth. On a given album when they did the doom-death they did it well, and when they did prog they did it expertly. \n\nIn a certain way Death may draw a comparison with Megadeth: a band that made it very big, and was utterly respected despite writing music that was distinctly lighter and more mainstream sounding than what the rest were doing in that genre respectively. This album here contains its darker moments, and even those aren't profound, but as a whole it is clearly very different from what \"death metal\" instantly brings to mind when it's mentioned to someone.\n",
        "\nThe last Death album is a real surprise - even against the background of a clearly different \"Symbolic\"! I will not mention that it was originally planned as the first album of Control Denied (there are rumors that \"Symbolic\" was supposed to be the first), because everyone knows it very well, but that it clearly breaks with the extreme, this is something definitely more worth mentioning in the context of this \"surprise\". It's really rare that a band closely associated with such a style would be able to record a masterpiece in a distinctly different style! Of course, this does not mean that Chuck Schuldiner with his Death has softened or recorded something totally inconsistent, because it's still death metal, but this one has become even more complex and diverse. Naturally, I mean the complexity of the whole material, and that's for the simple reason that \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" is best suited to death metal in style of Atheist or Cynic - so much \"jazzy\". However, despite the departure from death metal in the traditional sense (i.e. with blasts, wilderness, etc.), Chuck with his Death still exceed a large part of the bands dealing with underground music, the level of expression and the load of emotions almost unmatched. \n\nWell, the songs are a masterpiece by a capital M. Literally each one in turn! The compositions may not be the shortest or the most easily digestible here, but their length and degree of complexity are absolutely justified. A multitude of ideas, techniques, catchy, quite bold melodies, it all exploded here! The number of brilliant patents in them is simply shocking, and yet you cannot talk about exaggeration. \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" is a music perfectly composed and balanced, still full of very specific playing, but also full of amazing diversions and a unique atmosphere. What's more, all these progressive wonders came out naturally on this album by Death as if the musicians had been sitting in this style almost forever. It's enough to take a closer look at such songs as \"Scavanger Of Human Sorrow\" or \"Flesh And Power It Holds\", clearly developed on the basis of different - in relation to each other - motifs, and arranged in such a way that there are no sudden jumps or forced techniques. The other conclusions are the same as above, so I will not list each one in turn, because omitting one of them at this point would be harmful! Everyone is equally shocked with the genius of ideas and...beauty. At the end there was a huge surprise (though how does it sound in the context of the previous songs...). A cover of...Judas Priest! Chosen was well-known \"Painkiller\", but as for the interpretation that Chuck tried, this cannot be said to be too typical. The performance - paradoxically not much different from the original - makes an extraordinary impression, especially Schuldiner singing in the Halford type, the \"wow effect\" is solid.\n\nAnother advantage is the production of \"The Sound...\", extremely clear and polished, and at the same time very fleshy and with a huge kick. I mention it for a reason, because the sound perfectly showed what kind of technique the musicians had at the time. I will not discuss the leader, because I have already written about him in previous reviews (however, it's worth paying attention to the much higher voice of Schuldiner). I will focus on the other three accompanying Chuck bandmates. Scott Clendenin's bass stands out (he often gets a \"solo\" parts), Shannon Hamm's style looks interesting (a bit more subtle compared to Chuck), but the Richard Christy playing style is definitely the most impressive here. With all due respect to the previous drummers, Death has never had such drumming madness! A real show of skill, and at the same time everything fits beautifully with the music. In short: perfect balance. \n\nSo there can be only one summary. \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" is one of the best albums in the output of Chuck Schuldiner, continuing the band's great streak. The music is extremely technical and complex, but no less of a solid power and atmosphere. It's hard to find a better definition of perfection.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/02/death-sound-of-perseverance-1998.html\n",
        "\nThe subject of perfection in the case of Death is like a boomerang - it returns in almost every my (but not only) reviews. It looks no different to \"Symbolic\". The music is refined in every respect, full of compositional genius and - in my opinion - even better than \"Individual Thought Patterns\" and \"Human\". So the conclusion from it's clear, for \"Symbolic\" there is no scale! This is another Death album, where it's perfectly audible that the earlier patents could be approached completely differently, something else could be changed and - on the other side - still with strictly death metal sounds to create a masterpiece. Besides, \"Symbolic\" - although released in 1995 - probably best illustrates Chuck's condition in the last years of his musical activity. It was as if he already knew the end was near. You can even say that with this album, the name Death gained a special meaning... \n\nAt the moment, however, it acquired a truly unique meaning! Schuldiner's music has become a bit slower, sublime, arranged, it has gained a very \"depressing\" atmosphere, it also has a definitely different feeling compared to its predecessors. All of this, fortunately, did not fall into an exaggerated softening or any polishing of the material - it gave Death's music a whole new dimension. Of course, \"Symbolic\" is dominated by what is traditionally death metal for this band, i.e. a large dose of classic death metal playing, a lot of imaginative riffs (though somewhat less tech-oriented compared to \"Individual...\") and Chuck's characteristic vocal (here as if yet another more \"virulent\"). All the novelties - of which there were quite a lot - did not disturb the earlier style, they even made \"Symbolic\" even more unique and perfectly emphasized the pessimistic character of the whole album. I mentioned the latter a few lines above, so I'll just mention the titles that best reflect the style of the album - \"Empty Words\", \"Without Judgment\", \"Sacred Serenity\", \"Zero Tolerance\" are just one of several. The coolest thing, however, is that \"Symbolic\" can be proud of its advanced technique, sad atmosphere and death metal sound to the same degree. \n\nIt's also surprising that such an awesome album was created in a (almost) random line-up. Because while Gene Hoglan is not an casual musician (he's better than on \"Individual Thought Patterns\"!), so Bobby Koelble and Kelly Conlon were clearly weaker compared to previous musicians. As you can see, this did not prevent them from getting better, because Koelble's solos are just as hit as Schuldiner, and Conlon's bass, although very modest compared to DiGiorgio, also fits perfectly into the music (it does the background, but in a positive way words meaning). After all, they created a complete and absolutely one-of-a-kind album! Rarely you can talk about an album that is brilliant and which was recorded by a temporary line-up.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/02/death-symbolic-1995.html\n",
        "\nDeath was in an impossible physical position with their fifth album \"Individual Thought Patterns.\" The said album, being so damn inconsistent, is somehow both their best and worst record at the same time. Indeed, their point of greatest artistic genius, and their point of most puissant adversity and musical despair, both simultaneously. Ultimately, though, the good parts drown out the bad ones, and all you're left with is the most brilliant death metal made to this date, with some annoying three-minute interruptions in-between. Needless to say, Chuck Schuldiner did it again.\n\nInitially, I made the unfortunate mistake of listening to random individual tracks rather than the entire album in full. And even more unfortunately, the songs I picked were the worse ones of this record. I just gave up after hearing how calamitously horrible the title track was. I said to myself, \"damn, this is only worth keeping for The Philosopher.\" After some months of sitting in my shelf, it got a full listen for the first time in a night that I was binging classic death metal albums. And finally, it clicked. It was so good, that \"Altars of Madness\" that I rolled right after this one sounded like kiddie death metal. It paled in comparison, one of the classics!\n\nWhile it could be said that Death already transcended death metal by 1991 with \"Human,\" this record only further solidified their position as the ultimate death metal band. Maximus metallum if you will. You can tell Chuck was seeking to make his music as progressive as he could, perhaps trying to distance himself from the then-infamous death metal scene, to appear more intellectual. He did, albeit half of it was forcedly so, and the other half was his genuine work. The \"forced\" progressive segments would form songs like \"Overactive Imagination,\" the title track, and \"Jealousy,\" while the genuine parts would form those like \"Destiny,\" \"The Philosopher\" and \"Mentally Blind.\" The latter three tracks being Death's best songs to date if you ask me. There are even songs torn between the two, like \"Trapped In A Corner.\" Not even the songs themselves, no, not even the individual segments of the songs are free from inconsistency in this record.\n\nThe instrumental work is nothing short of magnificent. The guitar riffing is incredibly creative, technical and blows you off with emotions, whether they're anger and resentment, or sadness and despair. While it's technical and impressive all the way through, the riffing fails to consistently sound meaningful and emotional in a similar fashion to that. Oh well. Schuldiner's vocal performance is also complementary to his brilliant guitar performance, although you can sense that his vocals are beginning to weaken and degrade. Still, it's as strong as ever. Moving on to the lead guitar sections, good god they're almost a dream come true. My two favourite soloists, Chuck and LaRocque together, what more could I want? I don't think I even need to describe how unbelievably astonishing the solos are. Other than the solos, the leads in some sections are also what makes some of these songs the best of Death.\n\nMoving on to the less sparkly shiny instruments. The foundationals, bass and the drums. Steve DiGiorgio, that handsome little cookie. His bass playing here could be described as his physical appearance can be: Beautiful. While he just forms a good bridge between the guitars and the drums in the previous record, he also makes his creativity speak here with the astonishingly good fretless bass transitions. They're so damn good. I'd pay to see DiGiorgio just do those bass parts for a couple of hours. Gene Hoglan also manages to form a synergy between his drums and DiGiorgio's bass, though it's not as noticeably great as how well Reinert (RIP) worked with DiGiorgio in the previous album. Still, the drums aren't nil in this record, and that's extra points for me.\n\nThe tones of the instruments I just talked about are also inconsistent in how they fit the tracks. Sometimes they build a sound that enables incredible parts like the post-solo section of \"Mentally Blind,\" and sometimes they just sound weird like in \"Overactive Imagination.\" I've been unable to replicate the sound myself. All I can say is, it baffles me how the tone, of all things, can be inconsistent in an album. It almost makes me think Chuck was, in fact, trying to make everything unpredictable and discordant here. At least the production exerts itself. It's not perfect, but eh.\n\nI'd have wished Chuck perfected the sound he built with this album. We got Symbolic instead. I'm not complaining, Symbolic is the best Death album, in my opinion. But something as good as how this gets, with the excesses cut off, would've not only been Death's best effort, but also some of the best albums of all time.\n\nHere's the confused reader's guide to the album:\nSongs to listen: Trapped In A Corner, Mentally Blind, Destiny, Out Of Touch, The Philosopher.\nSongs to avoid: Overactive Imagination, Jealousy, Individual Thought Patterns.\nMixed bags: In Human Form, Nothing Is Everything.\n",
        "\nIn truth - but completely compleeetely - my opinion on \"Individual Thought Patterns\" does not differ from other fans of this disc. There is quite a simple dependency related to this release, which most probably already know very well. Well, this is another Death album with no such thing as good or very good songs, they are only brilliant and perfect to every detail! In such a situation, the \"new\" review should be based on some well-known delights (in the \"masterpiece of references\" type) or even copying from the Internet. On the other hand, it would also be appropriate to write more than 5 sentences about the release, which is still (rightly) said a lot. Exactly, \"Individual Thought Patterns\" - like \"Human\" - is an extremely worth knowing release, especially since Chuck once again managed to make another, considerable progress. \n\nOkay, now it should be outlined what music on \"Individual...\" actually is. Well, very technical, extensive, rich in various details (e.g. acoustics, keyboards, quite bold melodies - but by no means cheesy), still very death metal and even more thrilling from the point of view of the atmosphere (here again the keyboard inserts are showing everything). To put it simply, they managed to break through and - paradoxically - improve \"Human\". Despite the same rating, \"Individual Thought Patterns\" is like shifting the previous peak to another level. It also made its own strongly refreshed accompanying line-up, but it's actually like on every Death album. \n\nThe only one from the previous line-up, Steve DiGiorgio, this time reached for a fretless bass, added a lot of even more interesting decorations and also added a few excellent solos (especially in the ending of the \"The Philosopher\"). In my humble opinion, he recorded some of the best bass parts that appeared on Death albums! Gene Hoglan (previously known from Dark Angel) also joined the band, as time has shown, one of the best drummers to accompany Chuck. This drummer is definitely a different type of drumming compared to Reinert, but equally interesting and with more fast paces. Finally, a surprise! The second guitarist during the \"Individual...\" session was Andy LaRocque from King Diamond himself. He fulfilled the task - which is not so obvious - perfectly and at the same time showed that he was able to find himself in such a completely different style as well. Equally excellent is the sound of the whole, cleaner, more powerful, and at the same time \"warmer\" (especially from the rhythm section). \n\nI don't want to elaborate on the individual songs. They are all equally brilliant, they maintain the style characteristic of Death and at the same time, each of them has original and extremely different ideas - that's why I send you to check the whole thing one by one. It's not without reason that \"Individual Thought Patterns\" is said to be the best of the best that Chuck Schuldiner recorded under the name of Death. The choice is obviously not easy (as I mentioned in previous Death reviews), but...not so detached from reality!\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/01/death-individual-thought-patterns-1993.html\n",
        "\nThe best Death album is an extremely individual issue, but one thing is certain, \"Human\" is one of those that are the most prominent in describing it as the \"best\" album compared to the others. The reason is very simple (though - paradoxically - also accurate on the next albums), the music is well thought out, has a lot of changes, and at the same time there are no elements that strip the whole thing out of extremes. Anything else you need to add on such a known issue? Well, maybe \"just\" but for my eyesight (or rather my hearing), \"Human\" seems to be a model example, where Schuldiner achieved the most even proportions between technique and classic death metal patterns. But that's not the end of surprises, because \"Human\" is much higher surprises than my usual description above would suggest! This is because I am talking about an album that you get to know through several approaches and to which - despite my good conversion - still coming back with great pleasure. \n\nOf course, the significantly changed composition contributed to this. There was no survivor from the previous band except Schuldiner himself, so Chuck recruited Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal from Cynic and most of the well-known Steve DiGiorgio. In a nutshell, extremely talented musicians who presented a completely different feeling and skills from their predecessors on the discussed disc - more technical, sometimes even touching on jazz influences (although the latter is a bit of a generalization, especially in relation to Cynic's releases). In any case, Death's music has become much more complex and at the same time it has not lost its power and strength - the effect of even excellent \"Vacant Planets\", \"Suicide Machine\", \"See Through Dreams\" or \"Flattening Of Emotions\". Besides, \"everything is as old as it is better\". It's also worth mentioning the most catchy in this tracklist \"Lack Of Comprehension\" (where there is also a place for a surprisingly calm introduction) and the instrumental \"Cosmic Sea\" (with a great bass solo performed by Scott Carino) - i.e. songs that stand out much more above the norm even for Death. \n\nWell, the summary can only be one in this situation. More precisely, I will remind you what I said at the beginning of the review. Well, \"Human\" started the best period in Death's discography, where each album deserved the maximum and each brought a big breakthrough in Schuldiner's work. \"Human\" is the first of them which elevated the level of Chuck's music to total heights. It's enough to listen briefly to how far the production itself has gone.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/01/death-human-1991.html\n",
        "\n\"Spiritual Healing\" reportedly has the problem that it was released between the more groundbreaking \"Leprosy\" and \"Human\" - hence its supposedly slightly less popular. Well, even if it is true, it remains for everyone to wish to be so left out. In fact, \"Spiritual Healing\" is another great cd in Death's discography, brilliantly developing \"Leprosy\" patents and being as important a step in Chuck's development as other albums of his band. As for me, from \"Spiritual...\", it was the best time in the discography of Schuldiner began, where practically every next Death's album was better and better than the previous one (although literally all of them deserved a podium finish). The discussed one simply gained the nickname of being totally pointless. The only plus was that I could base my introduction on it and cheat some of the listeners. \n\nOn \"Spiritual...\" - as before - the proportions between technique and brutality changed (in favor of the former), even more interesting ideas were added (again from the guitar side), the songs gained on much more complex structures, the production went ahead, and the atmosphere of the music has become much more pessimistic (the cover and titles should explain everything here). For the first time, there was a \"full\" line-up on the Death album. While Bill Andrews and Terry Butler do not stand out with any extravagance above Schuldiner ideas, the new in the band James Murphy contributed a lot more than his predecessor. Solos are very important (the best example of which is a guitar duel in \"Low Life\"), but the ingenuity and quality of workmanship are what make me use \"Spiritual Healing\" more often than \"Leprosy\" (although the rating is the same). There is no exaggerated show of skills. \n\nIt's still mostly death metal and with the right balance, despite quite technical approach to playing. For example, \"Altering The Future\", \"Killing Spree\", \"Living Monstrosity\" or \"Defensive Personalities\", which abound in even more interesting riffs than the tracks from \"Leprosy\", are more complex, and at the same proportions they put on a beat. The technique just added another dimension without breaking the burden. Chuck's vocal has also slightly changed, his \"vomit\" is a bit lower (although, for example, in the title track he also occasionally gets higher). Besides, most of everything is based on \"Leprosy\" patents and improvements to that style. \n\nSo it's difficult to better illustrate the concept of \"the same, but better\". \"Spiritual Healing\" is another important release by Death, which is a logical extension of \"Leprosy\" and a prelude to ideas from \"Human\". In addition, this is another important release containing a lot of hits, which immediately fall into the \"favorite\" category and even after many years they can still be liked as much as when they first listened.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/01/death-spiritual-healing-1990.html\n",
        "\nA lot has been written about such cds as \"Leprosy\" (the question about which Death is not?), and yet this album is still very popular (and again, which Death is not?), and you can still come across those who they describe it with tremendous excitement as if it had just released today (and again, and which Death is not?). I am not surprised there, of course, Chuck's music underwent a lot of changes then and at the same time broke through \"Scream Bloody Gore\", and they could not make too much effort and record a copy of the debut album. Fortunately, it happened otherwise! \n\nFirst, a new line-up. Death was then joined by Bill Andrews and Rick Rozz, and the bassist duties were again taken by Chuck (Terry Butler joined after recording \"Leprosy\"). Both of these musicians, despite the fact that some of the weaker ones who passed through Death, paradoxically fit perfectly into Schuldiner ideas at that time, on the one hand much more technical (which, of course, guitars dominate), and on the other hand, still based on death metal \"splitting\". A new quality, but also a very important direction in which Chuck developed his music more or less on subsequent albums - so that it would be transparent in terms of genres (i.e. always death metal), and at the same time slightly different (within the known style). \n\nThis approach worked on the occasion of \"Scream Bloody Gore\" (against the background of demos), it also worked for \"Leprosy\". Songs such as \"Left To Die\", \"Born Dead\", \"Pull The Plug\", \"Primitive Ways\" or \"Open Casket\" offer a distinctly different feeling compared to those from the debut, they are more interesting and each of them is completely a different idea (so as not to confuse them with each other). However, I will not elaborate on this in more detail, as the previous paragraph has already referred to it a bit. However, the biggest impression on \"Leprosy\" is - attention, there are banalies/oxymorons! - not excessive brutality, quite catchy, cool, gloomy atmosphere and even better \"vomiting\" vocals. Moving on, on \"Leprosy\" there appeared also Chuck's tendency to combine riffs (but on a much smaller scale than later), which is generally something that can be considered one of the most important determinants of his group's style. Quantitatively, there is not much of it here, although in a few tracks it does add variety to the music. \n\nAnd all this perfectly shows how much \"Leprosy\" is a perfectly composed album. It's been a long time since its release, and the release still makes a huge impression and - as you can see from the volume of the review - still makes you think a bit longer. It's clearly visible on this album that death metal is not only a simple playing and a few simple chords, but much more - that this music can be as rich in terms of arrangement as other styles, not necessarily related to metal. The next longplays, which drifted with this \"wealth\" even further, were also confirmation.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/01/death-leprosy-1988.html\n",
        "\nThere are those for whom Death = the beginning of death metal as a genre itself. Logically, why should we be surprised, the name suggests a lot to think this way! Well, okay, everyone used to be a layman, so it should be corrected briefly and armed with adequate understanding towards such theories. The brain of the group, Chuck Schuldiner, of course, was not the first to invent death metal, but as one of the few he contributed to its dissemination and the creation of his own style that inspires many others. So much for the rather encouraging introduction to the rest of the reading of \"Scream Bloody Gore\", then I'm going to get a bit bored, after all, we're talking about a band that has already been quite exploited by numerous reviewers (and not only). \n\nSo I would treat this entry as one of those that are primarily intended to remind a little of the classics in accordance with the principle that good music should be shared rather than described in great detail. At this stage, Death is still quite raw death metal (sic!), with a slightly thrash metal feeling, full of Schuldiner screaming, far from escaping into less typical patterns and directly aggressive. At that time, the band that made up \"Scream Bloody Gore\" was only two people, contrary to what appears in the insert, Chuck Schuldiner - vocals/guitar/bass, Chris Reifert - drums. It can be quite a surprise, because these two young guys at that time created a great bang on the size of a \"full\" band, raw, but also relatively technical (especially from the solos side, you can hear the germ of the direction in which Chuck will go on the next albums). Here, too, the production did its job, which perfectly highlights the excellent skills of Reifert and Schuldiner, and at the same time does not take away any of its \"primitivity\" from the music. The \"gore\" type cover will probably not appeal to everyone (although there are also many supporters), but it fits the cover style and has its own charm. \n\nAs for the music itself, it's even better here. Virtually every track is of an excellent level, and such tracks as \"Zombie Ritual\", \"Evil Dead\", \"Sacrificial\" or the title track are absolute classics that perfectly show what exactly the style of early Death was (in \"Zombie Ritual\" there was, however, a delicate announcement the later one) - strict, aggressive, in a way catchy and even technical. The rest of the songs not listed are also worth checking, if only for the reason that they keep the level of the above-mentioned. \n\nAt the end, some clich\u00e9s again. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" - together with Possessed's debut - is simply an excellent source of cognition of such music, and at the same time a lot of well-thought-out, \"primitive\" death metal. It's hard to get a better start, everything that is desirable in this style (with an emphasis on being \"evil\") has just been reflected on the Death's debut! At this point, you could probably refer to several other cds with similar \"influence\", but it does not change the fact that \"Scream Bloody Gore\" is one of the (most) important ones.\n\nOriginally on: https://subiektywnymetal.blogspot.com/2021/01/death-scream-bloody-gore-1987.html\n",
        "\nDespite the fact that many fans bash this album, branding it as \" a waste of talent\" and \"flawed\", I believe that it's an impressive showcase of technical ability and Death's outstandingly evolved songwriting, and while this record may not be as memorable or groundbreaking as Human or Symbolic, it certainly is a force to be reckoned with in the parameters of progressive death metal. However, this is consequential, as The Sound of Perseverance is by far the most ambitious Death album, it was fairly obvious from the start that it was going to receive a divisive reception. Personally, I think that the progressive twists scattered within this album are, for the most part, great. They perpetrate what Chuck Schuldiner was capable of achieving, and there's no denying that some of these tracks are Death's absolute best - Flesh and the Power it Holds is legendary for its mesmerising instrumental section and unforgettable solo, not to mention the brilliant lyrical content, Spirit Crusher is particularly notable for its half-brutal half-melodic riffs, and the chorus, which is a highlight of the Death discography, whereas my favourite song is Story To Tell, the entire song just flows perfectly and is filled to the brim with inspired riffs, basslines, and a very mellow but powerful tone. Some complain that the guitar tone on this album is too thin, to the point where the solos even sound out of tune, but I disagree. The guitar tones might be quite lacking on the bottom end, but they are cold, atmospheric and vibrant, which matches the overall creepy feel of the writing. The production as a whole is fantastic, the drums are layered and really exfoliate Richard Christy's amazing playing, and the record seems to have a certain layer of fogginess blanketed over it, which might have been an intentional callback to the band's first album, Scream Bloody Gore, which adds a nice touch to both albums' legacies, as the bookend albums of this band's near-perfect discography.\n\nThe musicality has been improved a tad since Symbolic, despite not having as many class riffs or memorable moments, this is widely agreed to be Death's most enterprising album. The drums are just ridiculously technical and brilliant in every song, especially during To Forgive Is To Suffer and Scavenger of Human Sorrow, Christy is really at his peak on this record, and he boasts that in every minute, straight from the first 7 seconds of the album you'll realise just how skillful of a drummer he is. Scott Clendenin's bass tone is just as cold as the guitars, and while I think it could have been a bit thicker, he still plays his heart out, and the basslines differ from the guitar riffs noticeably, showing that some thought and effort was put into writing the bass parts. Shannon Hamm, who might be Death's greatest rhythm guitarist, boasts a wide array of gripping riffs, and he was an essential part of the making of this album, his playing is tight and complements Chuck's lead sections flawlessly. Bite the pain is probably the heaviest track from the album, featuring a very chuggy verse riff, with Chuck's disjointed vocal lines that make the verses unusually catchy, and a bizarre chorus that is split into almost 4 sections. \n\nDespite each song having wild instrumentals, the structures throughout the album are surprisingly straightforward, with most of the tracks just being verse, chorus, 2 minute instrumental section, verse, chorus, outro, and although this might leave a sour taste in some listeners' mouths and might come off as pretentious and lazy, it works well, and honestly in most of these songs, the riffs are just so good that the repetition is a good thing. The performance from every player is passionate as all hell, which is evident in the painkiller cover, which I don't really listen to all that often since the original is much better, but it's still a great performance from the entire band. Emphasising more on the ambitiousness of this album, the average track length has almost doubled compared to Death's earlier releases, which is a blessing and a curse. Although I love virtually every track on this record, I do think that some sections tend to drag on for too long, but it's never too redundant to the point where it ruins the song completely (did someone say every Dream Theater song ever written?).\n\nChuck's vocals on this release have been criticised massively, with even Autothrall, the king of metal reviews himself, making a point that Chuck's growls sound like a little girl whining. Although I can see his point, I definitely do enjoy the vocals, and I don't think that the guttural howl found on Leprosy and such would fit as well with these more melodic, laid back songs. I really enjoyed this album, every song slaps on the whole, the riffs are chilling, the drums are insanely precise but loosely articulated, and it was probably the best way for Chuck to put his band to sleep. I'm just glad that he didn't decide to decapitate the band entirely after the release of Symbolic, which it was rumoured that he was going to. Pick this one up for sure, whether you're a proghead or a brutal death metal fan alike.\n",
        "\nThis album is my favourite by Death, it's so emotionally captivating, and despite its ambitious nature and evocative songwriting, it never gets tedious to listen to, it's actually surprisingly accessible considering it's a mixture of the two least accessible metal subgenres (arguably). However, this album isn't flawless, admittedly some songs could be a little bit shorter, some riffs come off as weakly executed awkwardly articulated, but for the most part, this is an astounding record that never gets old, every track has multiple qualities that really present Chuck in his prime, this album is the first indicator that Death's sound has completely evolved, whereas Human and Individual Thought Patterns were just testing the waters, Symbolic goes fully-fledged prog death, and pulls it off almost flawlessly.\n\nStraight from the title track, it's evident that the riffs and sections on this album will be a force to be reckoned with. The main riff of Symbolic is possibly the most iconic Death riff, its creepy 5/4 rhythm and the overwhelming mix of emotions it brings (which goes for every song, actually) , the song is memorable, exhilarating, and has enough variety to keep you encapsulated in its bold 6 minute runtime. The transition into the chorus is mind-blowing, it has one of the best middle sections in a Death song, and the lyrics sound like Chuck became a deity, it could also be argued that his voice is at its strongest here, with his powerful grows filling every track and never letting up its aggressive and unforgiving tone, but the record of course has the inclusion of many melodic parts, all of which kick ass, in particular Without Judgement and Zero Tolerance, both songs have these beautiful solos and repeated melodies that are almost hypnotic, but what's more is when these melodies are just branching off from chuggy riffs and brutal galloping, but still manage to fit in convincingly.\n\nEmpty words probably has my favourite chorus, the track opens with a quiet intro that sounds almost Middle Eastern, it has a very evil undertone despite being passionate and solicitous, and that's another thing that this album achieves, it's very morbid and dark, almost evoking a feeling of hopelessness. 1000 eyes and misanthrope are extremely technical, groovy but emotional songs, both have riffs that just kick ass, and catchy hooks, relying heavily on structure, which is what makes the progressive side of this album so great; instead of just 90 seconds of thoughtless wankery in each song, each track has carefully processed melodies that actually fit in with the song, therefore they retain focus and refrain from being boring. Crystal Mountain and Perennial Quest are the \"epics\" from the record, they're both my favourite songs from it too, both songs gallop on with furious riffing and solos in between the verses and choruses, but the songs really shine as a whole, when you look at the entirety of the songs and how they're structured, they're both great tracks that involve some of the best Death riffs and lyrics ever written, and Perennial Quest wraps the album up with an amazing acoustic outro, which was the best possible way to end it.\n\nGene Hoglan performs on this album, so that pretty much automatically makes it the best Death album in terms of drumming, and Gene's performance had really improved on this album compared to Individual Thought Patterns, he expresses complex ideas flawlessly throughout the recording, for example: the chorus and outro of the title track, where he's playing crazily fast but precise fills with the hi-hat and double bass, and the intro to sacred serenity. Speaking of which, Kelly's bass work connects with Gene's drumming amazingly, he plays these complex basslines that just match with the drum beats, and his tone is thick, but doesn't dominate the bottom end. The guitars have a reverb effect that just sound so atmospheric and great, they did a good job on the production as a whole.\n\nI think just about everyone and their mother has heard this album, but if you're crazy enough to have not heard it by now, what are you doing?\n",
        "\nAh, Human by Death. The ultimate transitional album. Despite being their shortest effort, it could possibly be Death's most technical and ambitious album, and most of the songs on here are memorable classics. There is a clear change in musical aspects on this record, as the newly-obtained lineup consisting of Sean Reinert on drums, Steve DiGiorgio on bass and Paul Masdival on guitars definitely brought some jazz influences to Death, which would permanently alter the band's style; gone were the days of brutal riffing with blast beats and lyrics about raping zombies and shitting on their excised guts, Chuck ultimately ushered in a new signature sound for Death, a progressive, complex, intricate and musically fervent sound. This change was hugely controversial, and some fans even stopped following Death because of it (their loss). However, as time has passed, along with Chuck, this album has gained massive amounts of respect pretty much universally, and with good reason.\n\nStraight from the first track, flattening of emotions, which is one of the fastest and heaviest Death songs, you'll notice that the production has completely shifted, allowing for a more dynamic and layered approach to the songs, the drum intro is clean and serves as a nice tension-builder for the perfect transition into the crazy, rapid verse. The song then slows down during the chorus and the chorus riff is given variations, becoming lower every time, which is sonically effective, and really gives the song a lot of memorable qualities, but that can be said for the whole album. Every song has these complicated, unorthodox sections that are hard to explain, but they stick in your mind like Semtex, exploding into an array of unique musical components. This memorability is one of the main reasons as to why this album gets so much praise, especially in songs like Secret Face and See Through Dreams, where the riffs are morbid and relentless, but a technical touch is given to them, and virtually all of the songs have these wild middle sections filled with jazzy soloing and unpredictable time changes. For the most part, I'm not that keen on wankery, I have to be in the mood to listen to bands like Atheist and Watchtower, and full-on prog like Dream Theater is just the cure for sleep deprivation in my opinion, but these progressive twists during Human are far from boring, the solos carry so much emotion, nothing goes on for too long, it's like Opeth doubled their speed, quartered their song lengths and took an axe to the acoustic sections, that's the best way I can describe it to you without you listening to it for yourself. \n\nCosmic Sea is a weird track, it's a quiet instrumental, but much more atmospheric and ambient than Voice of the Soul in comparison, it starts with a keyboard intro and droning guitars, which sound melancholic, but deeply eerie at the same time. The entire runtime is doused with shredding, but in the first half it's accompanied by mellow background synths, and in the second half the heavy riffing starts. It's a bit of an unnecessary track, but that doesn't mean there isn't a lot to enjoy in it. Vacant Planets is an appropriate closer, it is filled to the brim with frantic melodies and multiple haunting riffs, which bring the album to its extremely sudden end.\n\nSuicide Machine is an absolute classic, it's probably the best example of what I mean when I say this album has a \"progressive nature\", most of the riffs are half-heaviness and half-melody, but the pre-chorus riffs are just amazing and climactic, the unexpected time changes just blow you away every time, and it's all pretty stably put together, considering just how extreme they got with varying the sections of the songs, and the chorus is probably one of the most famous Death hooks, with the iconic lyric \"A request to die with dignity, is that too much to ask? Suicide machine,\". However, my favourite song from this record is definitely Lack of Comprehension, with its beautiful intro that merges perfectly with the rest of the song, which is a brutal, galloping behemoth, every second is memorable, and the middle section is the most convoluted of the lot.\n\nThe lyrics also relate much more to human behaviour and philosophy compared to early Death material, which I believe was a necessary change, and to quickly sum up the lyrics of this album: they're all awesome, and Chuck's vocal delivery is possibly at its undisputed peak here, and I'm pretty sure it's a tie between this album and Spiritual Healing for Chuck's lowest vocal register, his primal howl is recognisable by almost every metalhead. I think it should go without saying that this album is essential, it's the most famous Death album for a reason.\n",
        "\nI feel like this is the black sheep of the Death discography, I don't go back to it this day, even after 15 or so listens that were (failed) attempts to see what some people praise about this album. Admittedly, this is progressive and musically advanced, but it just blatantly lacks what made the first two albums great : catchy riffing and effective songwriting. Some of these songs are just ultimately disjointed and even indicate a sense of writer's block. Although it's fortunately revived in later releases, the inspiration for this record has just seemingly run dry, the fluent riffing is absent, the consistent focus is gone, and the tight instrumentation has just apparently devolved into directionless patterns of progressive wankery. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for experimentation, and this album executes that sense of ambitiousness well, but it doesn't do enough with this leap of faith to keep me interested.\n\nThe production is pretty much identical to Leprosy, except the vocals are just ruined, I don't know what happened but it sounds like Chuck is singing underwater into a toy walkie-talkie, it just sounds atrocious, which is a shame considering his tone and aggression is impressive. The rest of the sonorities sound fine though, the drums are still massive, although the bass sounds like it's mixed lower. The drums are quite frantic but tight, which is a positive, and it's clear that Bill Andrews and James Murphy brought more skillful musicianship to the band, but at the end of the day, Chuck writes the songs, and it's up to him how their skills are utilised, so it's disappointing when the instruments fall flat for the most part.\n\nOne good thing about the album is that there are some strong points, the first half of Living Monstrosity has above-average riffing and catchy progressive melodies, but after that the album starts to seriously go downhill. However, the transitions between sections just sound unnatural and sloppy, I understand that this record was treading murky waters and trying new things, but they should've reconsidered whether or not some of these weird aspects should be included in the songs. Altering the Future is reminiscent of Leprosy's looming nature, but its riffs are just too dilapidated and lack the brutality and punch, like the band is trying to uphold technical accuracy over quality, and over-complicating riffs that would otherwise be enjoyable. Also, some of the sections in this song are just too repetitive, and it borders on being boring, which is an aspect that sadly persists throughout the album, on tracks like Within the Mind and Genetic Reconstruction, these songs just become a chore to listen to because of the gratingly overlong mediocre riffs, and with the exception of the cool solos, these tracks lack substance.\n\nThe title track is a great song, and easily increases this album's score by 10. It starts with a riff that actually sounds intriguing; it's dark and powerful, and the song evolves into the gallops that dominate every song here, except on the title track the galloping is actually exciting, and sprouts into a slower, heavier section, in which is one of the best Death solos. It's evil, catchy, sinister and utilises the progressive elements to be interesting, unlike the rest of this album. One great song, however, doesn't render an entire album with 8 songs great as well.\n\nOverall, this one was a let down, and for all of those people out there who defend this album and praise it, I'm sorry, I just don't see what's so special about it.\n",
        "\nLeprosy was, although not as ground-breaking as Scream Bloody Gore, extremely important in broadening the world of extreme metal. During this time, there was very little out there to offer in terms of metal that went beyond heavy metal, speed metal and the first wave of thrash metal. There was maybe Celtic Frost (and Hellhammer of course), Sodom, Mayhem, Napalm Death and Bolt Thrower, but apart from that, nothing even came close to black or death metal, as I stated in the Scream Bloody Gore review. That album, however, changed everything, and paved the way for Death's future. The result was Leprosy. Despite not being as musically flawless as its predecessor, or as shocking and materialistically explicit either, it certainly took Death to new technical and structural heights, and the songs are just as catchy this time around.\n\nThe listener is instantly enveloped in this eerie atmosphere when the title track kicks in, and Chuck lets out one of his best screams in his entire career. His vocals on this entire record are much more transpicuous and in an even lower register than Scream Bloody Gore, and the lyrical content focuses on brutal detail and dramatic adjectives rather than the usual \"fuck this fuck that kill the bitch rip out her cunt eat her corpse,\" and personally I think this really adds to the originality of Leprosy, but the vocals aren't the only thing that has been ameliorated. The riffs are slow, looming, doomy and even progressive at some parts, especially on longer songs such as the title track and Choke On It, both of which evolve really well and feel like properly structured songs that contain substance in their writing. Almost every riff is just pure death metal heaven, and there's an infectious groove on songs like Left To Die that seems to be exclusive to only this Death album. The choruses are also catchy as hell, Born Dead and Forgotten Path have these addictive hooks that are just filled with attitude and elaborate articulation.\n\nThe production has been massively improved, the drums sound massive and barbaric, and the drums parts themselves are much more technical here, Bill Andrews was a machine. the bass adds grit and headbangability and the guitars have a piercing echo. It's almost like they optimised the mixing to fit the songs perfectly, it creates this ruined, hopeless, aggressively melancholy atmosphere and I love it. Despite not returning to most of these singular songs that often, except for my two absolute favourites, the album in its entirety is a great experience that I never get tired of, even now after 30 or even 40 listens, it's one of those records you can just turn on and play all the way through easily because aforementioned cohesive production and brutal, unique songwriting. \n\nOpen Casket and Primitive Ways have a progressive nature that differed from the majority of extreme music at the time. The riffs diversify at a perfect rate, they're never too repetitive or too abrupt, and the subject matter is cruel and unforgiving, tapping into the morbid side of human nature, and it's such an interesting topic that isn't too samey or cheesy.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I have two clear favourites on this album : Born Dead and Pull the Plug. Born Dead is just explosive, impactful, memorable and overall competent in getting its message across, and every section is seamless and well-produced. Pull the Plug is on its own level entirely. It's easily one of the absolute best death metal songs of all time, because of the deathly emotion behind the riffs, I'd try to point out highlight riffs but that's just impossible, all of them are completely incredible. The intro riff, the second verse riff, both of the post-chorus riffs, and of course the chorus riff itself, which may be my favourite Death riff that isn't on their last two albums, and the solo, oh my God. Most of the solos on this album are sort of average, they're fine, but lack individuality and substantial quality, but the Pull the Plug solo is just legendary, it's mind-blowingly epic and evil, and cemented Rick Rozz as an essential guitar player that any fan of this style of music should look up to.\n\nTo conclude, while it's not perfect, it's a bloody great album that no death metal fan should skip.\n",
        "\nThe reason I'm giving this album a perfect score isn't because of personal reasons, I wouldn't even put it in my top 3 Death albums. However, I think it's objectively and influentially the best Death album, and the greatest death metal album ever recorded in general. Right off the bat, this record is flawless, every song, every riff, every second is just drenched in musical perfection and revolutionary brutality that was completely unheard of prior to Scream Bloody Gore's release. Allow me to explain why this album is so perfect.\n\nFirstly, every song has multiple riffs that are catchy, partially technical, unique (at the time), and exuberant, but dark and brooding at the same time. Prime examples of this are: the chorus riff of Denial of Life, the intro riff of Sacrificial, the verse riff of Regurgitated Guts, and even the first riff on the entire album, the crushing riff during Infernal Death during which Chuck screams \"DIEEEEEEEEE!!!!\" 3 times with ear-shattering sharpness and potency, and those 3 shrieks gave birth to an entire universe, which is now known as the prodigious genre of death metal. Regardless, the riffs are flawless on every track, they're never too repetitive or out of place, it's indicative that Chuck definitely put time and effort into writing these songs, and all of the sonorities are so proficient, but to top it all off, all of the guitar and bass tracks were performed by Chuck, which is only scratching this surface of his stupendous talent, which will become even more versatile and apparent on future albums. Chris Reifert, who was also Autopsy's drummer for nearly 30 years, plays the drums on this record, and he does an incredible job, never overdoing fills or trying to perpetrate his technical wankery, instead he stays focused and acknowledges that this album is supposed to be brutal, straightforward and in-your-face heavy, so he retains brutal patterns that synchronise with the guitars coherently.\n\nI was really surprised when I read the lyrics of this record, the subject matter was extremely explicit, profane, vulgar and grim for 1987, especially on the last half of the album. \"Decapitated head licking your cunt,\" \"Choking on your blood, I shit onto your guts,\" \"Suicidal preacher hangs himself, unfaithful servant goes straight to hell,\" \"Fucking raping zombie whores, killing feasting no remorse,\" this must have been pretty shocking and unwonted, considering the heaviest bands with the most gruesome images at the time were Exodus, Repulsion, and Sodom. The disturbing lyrics are a good thing though, as they only further prove that this album is one of the most influential pieces of music of all time. But the lyrics don't even hold a candle to Chuck's vocals, which are simply insane, and in every song, most notably Mutilation and Infernal Death, he belts out these enormous, thunderous, semi-intelligible screams that sound like they were recorded in the pits of hell. The vocals largely enhance the songs, as Death had made the ground-breaking invention of combining merciless D-standard riffing with demonic growls and shrieks. The result was the standard formula for any decent death metal band, it works like a charm and is HIV-levels of catchy.\n\nMore specifically, the catchiness on this record really shines on Zombie Ritual, which is everyone's favourite early Death song, including mine, and each section is articulated to incapsulate this catchiness, you've got the wails and screams layered over the riffs, and then suddenly the tempo changes, the guitars switch from tremolo picking to drones, everything is so dynamic and intense in the few slow seconds, then the speed picks up again, a new riff is thrown down, and Chuck bellows what is possibly the most iconic line in all of death metal, both lyrically and sonically \"Drink from the goblet, the goblet of gore,\" the way Schuldiner says it is so diabolical and so eerie, but simultaneously prominent. It really is musical perfection, and the absolute highlight of this album, or any death metal album in general.\n\nThe melodies also struck me on this album, they're for the most part doomy and gripping, which fits with the rest of the record, but they're also beautiful and atmospheric. Just look at the intro melody to Evil Dead, it's such a great way to start the song. The solos for most of the songs also have an eastern twist to them, and I can't get enough of it. The solo at the end of the title track is probably the best example of this, it's such a quintessential solo and it's short, but gets the message across. Production-wise, the entire record is foggy, dark and unsettling, the guitars have a fair amount of reverb, and the drums have a pounding echo which adds to the grotesque atmosphere. The bass has a fairly dominant mix, something which is unfortunately uncommon in the modern spectrum of metal, and the loud bass gives the sonorities a skeletal, cryptic tone, if that makes sense. \n\nOverall, this is a flawless masterpiece, an album that any self-respecting metalhead views as an important and essential milestone in the history of metal music. It might take some time to get into, especially if you're new to the genre, but once you finally indulge in the greatness that is Death's discography, you won't regret it.\n",
        "\nThis is Death\u2019s 5th album, and it showed how drastic the band\u2019s transition was from pure death metal to more progressive and power influences. This solos in this album are much less chromatic; but the songs still have the brutality of the first 3 albums, similar to human. Although I prefer human to this album, Individual thought patterns still holds up amazingly well today.\n\nSongs like trapped in a corner have great riffs that have an almost perfect balance between sheer brutality and technicality. I think that\u2019s what makes the last half of the death discography very special to me; there\u2019s a perfect equilibrium between two very different styles of metal, something that was very rarely done before or after Death\u2019s legacy, and was virtually seldom replicated the way Chuck did it in his writing. The guy had so many influences that formulated his genius songwriting. \n\nThe album starts off with Overactive Imagination, a short but relentless song. Jealousy is another interesting song, featuring more of Chuck\u2019s philosophical lyrics and his addictive riffing. I\u2019m not too keen on the song \u201cout of touch\u201d, because it\u2019s really about Chuck turning his back on the death metal community, which is pretty sad considering he was a pioneer of death metal. The album is wrapped up with the philosopher, a mind-blowing song that really showed us a taste of things to come (symbolic, anyone? How about the sound of perseverance?). Anyway, this record is essential, and it\u2019s my 2nd least favourite death album, so when I say that this record is essential, you know that death is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe production in this album is about on-par with human, although I feel like they could have mixed the vocals slightly better, everything else sounds pleasing to the ears, and songs like \"Jealousy\" signify the most that Chuck really wanted to change Death's direction, the more dynamic alterations to the production compared to the first 3 albums almost go hand-in-hand with the refined songwriting, which works well. This is the first Death album to feature Gene Hoglan on drums, and he kills it. \n\nOverall, this album has bad luck, as it is sandwiched between two absolute masterpieces, but that doesn't mean it should be ignored, the songs on here have aged well, and they all have something gripping to offer,\n",
        "\nIf I had to use one word to describe this album (and most other albums released by this band), that word would be \"frustrating\". Frustrating in the amount of different things it has that are both completely awesome and completely terrible; frustrating because their more progressive works can be summed up as \"occasional moments of genius drowning in a complete mess\"; frustrating due to one man utterly dominating the songwriting process (which is rarely a good idea). Death has an extremely weird evolution of sound where they always kept somehow progressing and regressing at the same time, in the sense that their music kept becoming increasingly more technical, but also increasingly more structurally unsound. This album (and, by extension, Schuldiner's Control Denied project) represents the peak of all of those frustrations, as well as their most divisive output. There are many elements that contribute to this album's status, so an explanation is in order.\n\nThe highlight of this album are the riffs. They are stylistically reminiscent of melodic death/thrash metal, and exhibit a great combination of catchiness and technical prowess. Chuck Schuldiner's main strength in songwriting is his amazing sense of melody. No matter if his style is brutal or sugary, technical or straightforward, the man still lays down catchy hook after catchy hook, his riffs and melodies full of conviction. A great example is the first half of \"Flesh And The Power That It Holds\": a brief technical display goes into a melodic power metal intro, then suddenly makes way for a monstrous thrash riff and continues to slay everything in sight with more riffs than you can count... at least, until the solo comes in.\n\nThat is where the compliments end. The solos on this album are utterly terrible, and most of it is the fault of that lead guitar tone. When the guitarists are playing slow-paced \"feel\" solos or harmonies, it sounds alright, but as soon as they start shredding, or even do a pick scrape or whammy dive, it grates on the ears far more than it has any right to. And every single solo on this album contains several sections like this, so you never get to enjoy any of them to their fullest. As for the rest of the instrumental performances, Richard Christy's drumming doesn't fit into the songs at all. He never makes an effort to keep a steady beat, and instead plays the most technical beats he's capable of, leaving all of the timekeeping to the rhythm guitars. Even when he plays some semblance of a conventional beat, he always feels the need to break it by hitting his cymbals a ridiculous amount of times and turning it into a total mess. The MVP award here has to go to the bass playing of Scott Clenderin - very audible, technical, yet always tasteful and well incorporated into the songs.\n\nBut those shortcomings are nothing compared to the big issue, the Achilles heel of every Death release past 1987: the song structures, or rather, lack thereof. This is an issue which started to show itself during Leprosy and has endured all the way throughout the rest of Chuck Schuldiner's career. Every non-instrumental track he's written since then uses the exact same structural arrangement: a selection of riffs is repeated two times in the same order with minimal variation (the most you can hope for is a slightly changed lead break), while the bridge and solo are sandwiched between those repetitions. The glaring problem with this arrangement is that Chuck makes no effort to variate any of it. It's like a leash holding him back, and he can only momentarily break free from it by not including any vocals in a song. And this album suffers far more from it than any of his earlier creations, as the songs are much longer, much more technical, practically begging for some kind of variation. But when it does arrive in the middle sections, it's all wasted on a combination of clueless bass breaks, sudden stop-and-go rhythms (presumably pale imitations of Watchtower) and the hideous soloing mentioned above. Special mention goes to \"Bite The Pain\", which fills this space with a goddamned metalcore break, complete with all of the cringe that they normally induce.\n\nBut the structural problems don't end there. The song structures are also plagued with many disjointed vocal lines that further harm the meaning of the preachy, cringeworthy lyrics (listen to \"Story To Tell\" for a good example). And the icing on the cake is that the riffs don't even work well with each other. These riffs sound like a collection of different riffs from different songs, hastily stitched together with no attempt to make anything work. This further compounds the biggest issue of his songwriting: the ideas don't develop. They don't have the capacity to gradually transform and progress the song: rather, they just keep being replaced with more ideas and retreating to show themselves once more during the eventual second rep. \"Spirit Crusher\" has it especially bad. There are good riffs there, even great riffs, but none of them are properly organized. It's just a bunch of promising ideas that come and go, come again and go again, wasting precious space and doing nothing to move the song forward.\n\nThe golden nugget here is, of course, \"Voice Of The Soul\". It's a dual guitar jam where the guys momentarily push all of those things aside and just yank on the feels, their aim being to let out their pent-up emotions and show you that they are still more than capable of kicking ass. And it's beautiful. Whenever I want to drive myself to tears, this piece does so every single time, without fail. For about four glorious minutes, none of those burdens exist, the structure is not bound by any restraints, the screaming sound of the guitars is used to accentuate the feeling, and Chuck is awesome again. And yet, it is still a mere respite from the bigger picture, and it only compounds the frustration from listening to this album.\n\nNow, this would still be a decent album, and it's something that I can still enjoy from time to time... but then it ends on the most blatant \"fuck you\" of the band's entire career. \"Painkiller\" is one of the worst cover songs I've ever had the displeasure of hearing - completely unrecognizable from the original. Yes, Chuck does many insanely high shrieks on it, but they all sound like utter dogshit, like he's straining to hit all of the notes. The lower tuning strips the riffs of their energy, Christy's drumming is a complete mess, and the awesometastic solos of the original are all replaced with the same sloppy shredding as the rest of the album. It's also difficult to see this as Chuck testing the waters for his Control Denied project, because that sounds damn near identical to the original material on TSOP. But more on that some other time...\n\nIt's quite sad, really. Here is the output of an incredibly talented musician, with many strengths to his songwriting and the ability to gather other great performers around him; and yet as time went on, his music became bogged down with more and more glaring flaws, and all of them culminated on this album. Long before the man himself would contract cancer, his works started to suffer from a sort of musical disease that he succumbed to without much resistance. That is why The Sound Of Perseverance (along with most of Death's other albums) is so frustrating to listen to. There is immense potential contained within it, and yet nothing is done to fully realize it; and seeing as its mastermind lives no more, nothing will be done. This is what it is, this is what it will be.\n",
        "\nBy the time Individual Thought Patterns came out, Chuck Schuldiner had already distanced himself from the horror themed sounds that characterized his early records. By no means was this an issue; Human defined this new style for good and still retained a far sense of brutality. Somehow things changed for the worst here and while Schuldiner's new company of musicians could all play well, the result would be a serious mess of an album.\n\nWhereas Human hinted an advanced version of Death that felt like the logical successor to pre-Focus Cynic (not surprising considering the involvements of Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert), Individual Thought Patterns sounds even more loose. On paper this should be rather ideal; these compositions are pretty short so there's no way things could go wrong, right? Unfortunately, Chuck Schuldiner had become his own enemy at this point. \u2018\u2019Mentally Blind\u2019\u2019 is an example of a \u2018\u2019riff salad\u2019\u2019 gone totally wrong; while starting off on the right foot it doesn\u2019t take long before a series of disconnected randomly-written riffs pop up for no reason from time to time. The fastest blistering riffs still recall Human, sure, but why not listen to that album if you want to enjoy a collection of cohesive composition instead?\n\nTracks like \u2018\u2019Overactive Imagination\u2019\u2019 and ''Nothing is Everything'' sound like a fine continuation of the direction Death had taken circa Human, although they're not quite as vicious. Still, rather enjoyable for what they are, they're definitely the highlights on Individual Thought Patterns. Unfortunately, the rest of the material exchanges aggression for a more progressive approach with pretty bad results. \u2018\u2019In Human Form\u2019\u2019 already appears more melodic and progressive than anything Schuldiner had written before and while some riffs definitely sound challenging, the result is something so damn tame it\u2019s not even funny. \u2018\u2019Destiny\u2019\u2019 opens through a calmly acoustic motif for a change, yet slowly turns into another mediocre effort; that chugging chorus riff certainly sounds rather uninspired while the riffs that resonate around it come and go with little direction in sight. Interestingly enough Individual Thought Patterns turns from bad to worse at the very end - \u2018\u2019The Philosopher\u2019\u2019 relies a lame chugged riff verse and with Schuldiner\u2019s cohesive vocals upfront it\u2019s pretty much karaoke material. There\u2019s just no way around it; whereas the majority of Individual Thought Patterns comes off as a combination of too many random ideas getting thrown into a blender, this song sounds surprisingly dumbed down and while that should be more ideal on paper, the result is pretty much laughable either way.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough yet, there\u2019s also something else to pay attention to: the lyrics. Chuck Schuldiner warns us about people with bad intentions (shock horror!), tells us how he has outsmarted others and criticizes philosophers (or makes fun about Paul Masvidal\u2019s sexuality? We may never know for certain). While moving away from gore is obviously no issue, the lyrics here are so in-your-face that they read more like Schuldiner\u2019s diary and it's just embarrassing.\n\nDespite the occasional interesting riff, spirited drum performance and the impressive solos, Individual Thought Patterns just doesn\u2019t work. It certainly has its moments, but as a whole it's seriously incohesive, bloated and confusing. I recommend this album to those who prefer the company of dogs over people, enjoy complaining about people who lack emotional intelligence and have a tendency to whine about bothering superficial conversations. As for the rest of you folks who are just as ordinary as I am\u2026go spend your time elsewhere and avoid this crap.\n\nThis review was originally written for antichristmagazine.com\n",
        "\nIn my review for Possessed's \"Seven Churches\", I mentioned the argument on who made the first death metal album. I've said that Death's \"Scream Bloody Gore\" was the first true death metal album, and that \"Seven Churches\" was more of a mix between thrash and death metal. In my opinion, Death was the band that truly got the death metal bandwagon going, as Possessed kinda steered away from pioneering the new genre in exchange for doing their own thing. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" serves as an excellent listen for the early stage of death metal, and is a must have for those who want to get a taste of the genre.\n\nBut first, what makes this album \"true death metal\"? That mainly stems from the instruments. The guitar riffs have more speed and aggression to them, the drums have fast-paced beats that have an echo sound, and the bass is low-tuned and brings in an evil sound. A good example of this would be the first track \"Infernal Death\". Chuck Schuldiner does the vocals, guitars, and bass in the album, and his moments particularly shine here. The violent guitar riffs and loud drums in the song bring in an atmosphere of chaos that is executed well with the fast speed. Schuldiner's vocals are also great. His voice has his famous shrieking, and they give it an insane sound. His vocals generally flow great on the songs, and is unique to the many low-gurgles of many death metal vocalists.\n\nAnother superb moment in the album is the lyrics. Thrash metal is known for having some graphic moments in the lyrics, but in \"Scream Bloody Gore\", the violence in the lyrics were taken to the extremes. Keep in mind that this was before Cannibal Corpse came and shock the world with their overly-grotesque descriptions of murder, so this was shocking back in 1987. An excellent example of this would be in the song \"Mutilation\". The lyrics are about killing someone out of rage. The descriptive details on stabbing someone in the face is pretty gruesome. Just look at the first verse:\n\nMassacred, hacked to death, my revenge\nSlicing deep, into your flesh, the pain intense\nDreams of hate, misery, fill my mind\nPuke in your face in disgust, it's time to die\n\nThese lyrics are pretty scary and give the listeners an uneasy feeling. They are also executed well with Chuck's aggressive voice and the deadly atmosphere the instruments bring in. Again, this was before we got masterpieces like \"Hammer Smashed Face\", so this album was ahead of its time for putting out these lyrics. Nevertheless, the lyrical abilities in the album are excellent overall, and are executed well with the chaotic sound.\n\nOne of my favorite songs off the album is \"Baptized in Blood\". The guitar riffs are awesome, as they play faster and more aggressive than usual. Schuldiner also had some of his best vocal performances here. His voice is not only shrieking, but also have pure screams of terror. This fits the lyrics about a cult and their killings. And let's not forget the guitar solo that plays in the middle of the song. While it does have a bit of a thrash sound, it has an echo sound that gives it some power. This is a song that I would put in my list for \"Top 10 Best Songs from Death\".\n\nIf it wasn't \"Seven Churches\" that got the death metal genre started, then it was definitely \"Scream Bloody Gore\". This album has plenty of memorable guitar riffs and vocal performances, as well as having disturbing lyrics for the time. Later on, Death would make more albums that would popularize the death metal genre further like \"Leprosy\", \"Symbolic\", and \"The Sound of Perseverance\". However, this album still remains one of their greatest works, and I have to thank Chuck Schuldiner and Chris Reifert for creating the death metal genre we know today.\n",
        "\nIn the late spring of 1987, there would be a band that will release an album that not only would influence many metal musicians in the future but also help define and set the standard of a whole new genre of music called death metal. That band is Death and this is their debut album, \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d. I know there\u2019s still debate over who really created death metal when speaking of this album as many do claim Possessed\u2019s debut \u201cSeven Churches\u201d being the very first death metal album but I have to strongly disagree. Though I do view \u201cSeven Churches\u201d as the template of what death metal would become; I felt it was more of a thrash album with proto-death elements while \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d took those proto-death elements and pushed it to the forefront. After getting that out of the way, let\u2019s actually talk about the album at hand now shall we? \n\nOur lineup consists of Chris Reifert on the drums and the legendary Chuck Schuldiner on vocals, bass, and guitar. Throughout Death\u2019s activity, Chuck would be the only core member on all the albums and the chief writter of the material; basically he was his own captain and all the crew mates helped steer his boat but he was the one to make the final decisions to tread on musical territory that other ships may not have sailed (sorry for the silly analogy). Before I go into detail about Chuck, I want to express how great Chris was on the drums here. This was Chris\u2019s only studio appearance on the drums for Death and what a performance he gave. Chris\u2019s drumming is tight and on point with Chucks vocal and instrumental delivery as there is no missteps as he goes all out and smashes that snare like in \u201cDenial Of Life\u201d to completely do a 180* and slow things down right on the spot in the middle of \u201cSacrificial\u201d. There\u2019s just nothing sloppy coming from Chris\u2019s kicks and wrists. \n\nMoving over to Chuck; it\u2019s honestly very hard to just describe my feelings about his writing and performances as I hold him to a godly status. His playing on the bass and guitar should make any musician jealous as it is so concise that it leaves very little wiggle room for a flaw. Just like Chris, Chucks playing goes in and out of fast paced shredding to a slowed down mid-pace crawl. His use of melody is also on another level compared to the death metal acts that would quickly emerge as he focused on his hooks and how they play out instead of just downright speed and aggression. Chuck can dial it back when the song needs it and really makes these songs just ear catching. \u201cRegurgitated Guts\u201d, \u201cTorn To Pieces\u201d, \u201cInfernal Death\u201d, and the out right badass \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d takes the interesting and catchy riffing from the thrash metal acts and just turns the dial; giving us a chaotic but reserved performance that doesn\u2019t lose its catchy melody\u2019s. \n\nFinally Chucks vocal performance is down right nasty here, probably having the most snarl than the rest of the discography. The use of his screeches and high pitched raspy singing is something unique in the death metal world as it\u2019s a vocal delivery many would forgo for the low growls and grunting. Over time he would continue to experiment with his vocals but \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d would be his rawest performance.\n\nThe writing itself mainly consists of speedy riffing with many mid-tempo breaks in between songs while retaining a catchy melody that I mentioned before. It\u2019s highly technical for it\u2019s time, even more so than what most thrash metal acts where putting out. You can throw variety out of the window for this release but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing as this is a debut after all and has all the positives with Chuck and Chris\u2019s technical skills. The writing of the lyrics also doesn\u2019t have much variation as most deal with horror cliches that death metal would ultimately be associated with; which you can point to this and Cannibal Corpse in perpetuating. \n\nThe production is something that leaves more to be desired as the vocals sound very muffled here; which makes me get more of that raw vibe that I feel Chucks vocals have here. There\u2019s also a level of echo that kind of gets on my nerves but not enough that takes me out of the album. The production is just average overall and in the coming albums there would be big improvements. \n\nOverall, \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d is a very important release for metal; showing a new path that the genre can take and all the extremes that come with it. Is this Death\u2019s and Chuck\u2019s best work? No but it is a fantastic release and a special release within the genre. Death has just put out better albums that will have more levels of technicality, variety, and melody that expands off from this debut. If you want to start listening to Death, start here and follow in order all the way to \u201cThe Sound Of Perseverance\u201d as it will take you on a journey of musical quality that most bands and musicians dream of being able to do. Scream out your bloody fucking guts!!!\n",
        "\nHere I attempt to handle the mixed emotions part of the music business that invariably comes into play for me. Relapse Records has issued a streaming Death show from Montreal from June 22, 1995, part of a series the label is doing. I'm all for Death getting some old and unreleased recordings out there, but at the same time the quality of both the recording and the material should be up to Chuck Schuldiner's standards, dead or not. This particular gig is the first offering from Relapse in what is called the Non-Analog \u2013 On Stage Series, providing some lost gems to the fan base that is chomping at the bit for more Death material to surface. \n\nSo I'm listening to the stream of this gig, a show I may very well have had on some battered cassette tape many years ago, and I'm digging the rawness of the recording. Now, to be clear, I'm sure people are going to bitch and moan about the quality of the recording; this show was probably never meant for distribution or to rival the store-bought material; yes, the sound is \u201cless than ideal\u201d by analog standards, but it's a very quality recording in and of itself. For what amounted to a \u201cbootleg\u201d recording, and I've heard literally thousands in my lifetime, it's a pretty damn cool and tangible glance into the energy and ferocity of a typical Death show back in the day. I was lucky enough to have seen the band more than a dozen times from 1987 to 1998, and I can't recall a bad or \u201cphoned-in\u201d gig. Chuck and crew always gave their all, occasional mistakes and mishaps abound, and I never left feeling I missed something. \n\nWhat is really nice about a special offering like this, these oft-covertly-or-band-taped gems, is the lack of polish slapped over it. In short, you can hear the systematic brutality of a live Death performance without all of the nuances usually applied with careful and steady hands to \u201cembellish\u201d or \u201cenhance\u201d the sound. I think we all understand that no live album is actually a totally live piece, no matter what Eddie Trunk might opine to the contrary, but a special show like this has all of the velocity and energy of a live gig showcased precisely as it was meant to be heard: raw, dirty, loud, and intense. The unaltered crowd applause and howling between songs is so enthusiastic and genuine that I got goose bumps hearing such magnificent excitement. Even the sparse moments of source tape warble or drop-out is so nostalgic-waxing for me that I feel like I'm back in a familiar area of my youth again. I have to think Chuck would approve. \n\nAs for the band's performance overall, I hear the occasional mistake or blunder, and that's the beauty of the recording. I hate hearing a supposed live record only to have so much overdubbing and cuts-and-paste that it ruins and sterilizes an otherwise class recording (ala Tribute or Unleashed in the East). I suppose that was what drew me to the tape-trading underground so early, the vast desire to hear things in their naked, purest forms. The Symbolic tour was a rager in every way (a tour I caught up in Madison, Wisconsin with a friend), and Montreal had a strong and exuberant show in front of them. The band tore through anthems like \u201cPull the Plug,\u201d \u201cThe Philosopher,\u201d \u201cJealousy,\u201d \u201cSuicide Machine,\u201d and \u201c1,000 eyes,\u201d to name a few. I hope these see physical releases on CD and vinyl, as I'm sure they'd be eaten up rather quickly. The performance of \u201cJealousy\u201d was so damn potent and brutal that I honestly felt like I was back in the Paramount Hall for brief moments throughout; if you were lucky enough to witness Death in all of its glory, you saw something very special and as honest as it came. During \u201cLack of Comprehension,\u201d just listen to one girl's reactions from the audience as the band flies through the song \u2013 what the hell else is needed to feel the energy from that room? \n\nI've a feeling this series of shows the label plans to release over time will both sustain and delight hardcore fans of death metal and Death in general. Once you can get past the \u201cimperfect\u201d source material and hear the gig exactly as it was performed that night, note for important note, you'll no doubt come away with one hell of an understanding of what a live Death show was like within its own sphere of energetic design. It was tribal-like ritual not everyone will understand, and that's okay \u2013 it's our music, anyway. \n\nCheck the link on YouTube on the official Relapse Records channel, and if these become available for purchase, be sure to support the product! \n\n(Originally written for www.metalbite.com)\n",
        "\nI got into death metal in the mid 90's but I overlooked the band Death because they were not deep and down tuned enough to my liking like Obituary or thrashy enough like Sepultura or Morbid Angel. I was first exposed to them when I heard the song Symbolic on Death is Just the Beginning compilation. It did not grab me for the above reasons. \n\nFast forward to mid 2000's and my taste in metal changed to seeking something more progressive. I came across the song Jealousy and was immediately amazed by the technicality and ferocity of the opening riff. Even today I am in awe at how Chuck plays this riff at such speed and precision. Together with his unique raspy screams, this is a song that demands respect and attention. I then explored songs from their other albums and was blown away by the quality of the music. I was deciding which album to purchase so I chose Individual Thought Patterns because it is a few albums deep into their career and therefore I expected the band to have 'ironed out some creases' by then and able to produce something not too raw and experimental sounding. \n\nI like the album in its entirety because the production is clear but not polished so it does showcase a sense of rawness. I particularly like how we can hear Steve's bass through many of the tracks and he clearly demonstrates a funky/jazzy style of metal bass. The drumming is very tight on this album but it does not dominate or overpower the other instruments, instead the sound is of equal weight and volume. \n\nThe highlights for me are Chucks ability to create meaningful solos which appear in each song at the right moment and all have emotion, particularly the solo on Overactive Imagination and Mentally Blind. His ability to create and deliver a huge variety of riffs that are played with speed and precision continue to amaze me. Chuck's song writing is particularly interesting as its intelligent and thoughtful which is really original. I do like his vocals on this album also as it suits the style and pace of the music and if you listen intently enough you can understand what he is saying. \n\nI am still discovering new sounds even after listening to the album hundreds of times, and I often return to this album from time to time and still receive the same joy and amazement listening to it, even though I know what to expect with each song. \n\nThe album features class acts, all showcasing their talents and skills, and I have a huge respect for all of them, particularly Chuck. His style and musicianship has really shaped my taste in metal greatly and this album pretty much started the shift to metal that is interesting, talented, yet heavy and crushing. \n\nAn excellent album that I recommend to anyone who appreciates metal.\n",
        "\nBefore fully entering with the elements and factors that I will expose here about this album, I think I need to say that this Death's sound is entirely different from their other releases, so I strongly recommend you, dear reader, that if you start listen to Death from here, maybe you will encounter a different idea about any comments you read on the internet or from another metalheads, so, I think is a good idea that you start listen the old Death and the reasons of that will be explained here in my opinion; and when you're ready, enjoy this awesome album as it should be.\n\nWhen I discover Death about 10 years ago, I was hooked immediately because the high quality of their sound, Chuck vocals and talent of this \"Father of death metal\". Also, the moment of listening The Sound of Perseverance finally came and I really think that, at this time, Death was not even a shadow of it was in their first ages, but it can be negated that this production has a very skillful musicians playing their instruments with high accuracy and a lot of superb riffs.\n\nIn terms of music quality, the mastering, mixing, recording and that studio stuff was very well done in this one. Compared to the other release, is obviously that they improved exceedingly the quality. Additionally, all the instruments were recorded very well, the guitars, bass and drums can be heard perfectly. I think that maybe the bass could have more presence here but, it is a little element. Also, Chuck was characterized for looking for a very skillful musicians that satisfy his music style and proposals, for that reason, in this case, Richard, Shanon and Scott were the right ones to capture the Chuck's ideas, especially, the high ability of Richard Christy to play the drums, this man is a fucking machine, tempo changes, consistent double bass drum like in \"Bite the Pain for example and absolute domain if his instrument. Shannon and Scott are also a very capable musicians and if you ask me, they have done an excellent job on this album too, feeding the album with a perfect sound, characteristic of progressive death metal bands. \n\nAt this point, why I say that you need to start listen to older Death's albums, simple, from the beginning, Death was a pure death metal band and I always think that when Death was founded, Chuck was almost a teenager so, from Scream Bloody Gore to this album, you can appreciate the Chuck evolution of his band and point of view about death metal in general, for that reason, I recommend to listen their albums in chronological order, to fully enjoy the evolution of Death and to realize why Death becomes the band that produce The Sound of Perseverance. The changes that they suffer with time and the sound of every album allows you to understand what Chuck wants for his music and why he constantly change the members of the band till reach the sound he wants. \n\nIt is true that The Sound of Perseverance is not \"pure\" death metal and their sound is more progressive, giving to the band a new way to play music separated from Death's original idea. But, this makes The Sound of Perseverance a bad album, not exactly, why? Because Chuck made good music, even if he changes the initial idea of his band, maintaining the line of making death metal in a different way. \n\nBut, unfortunately, not all in this album ere good things, Death committed some errors and are things that could be better or even, they could erase for this album, what are those things? First, in this production you can hear the very damaged Chuck's vocals that are nearly compared to black metal singers, giving to the album a different sound that doesn't fill at all. Second, in my opinion, I think that Chuck could do a better job writing the lyrics for this album, although the lyrics have a deep message, if you pay attention to each song lyric, you will realize that are not so deep and coherent. Third, a song like Voice of the Soul (that is a fucking masterpiece, really) could be included as a bonus track or something like that, because you are used to listen fast metal and headbanging riffs from the other release and The Sound of Perseverance is not the exception, for that reason, I think this song shouldn't be on this album as a regular song. And fourth, I have the idea that The Sound of Perseverance shouldn't be released as a Death album, I prefer to listen this one as a Control Denied album, Death finished their career in Symbolic, was not necessary to release another album, especially with Chuck's vocals so damaged at that time but, it can be negated that exceed my expectation and ended up being an awesome release.\n\nTo finish, Death always be a must-listen band for all metalheads and it doesn't matter if in the end, Death doesn't like you, is part of the death metal and metal (in general) history, Chuck became a pioneer and left a legacy of what metal is nowadays. I know that this is not their best album, but give it a chance, I know that even if you are more old Death fan, you will enjoy this production. Additionally, I want to recommend the songs that I consider the best ones: Scavenger of Human Sorrow, Spirit Crusher and Flesh and the Power It Holds (my favourite).\n",
        "\nI have read that modern cars do not have a CD player anymore. How I hate the modern times! I am waiting for the day the European Union forbids to produce record players, because an overeager environmentalist has found out that the playing of vinyl releases a dangerous form of particulate matter. However, until today I do not hurt any laws when putting a great album on my turntable. One of the greatest is \"Leprosy\", the second work of Chuck (R.I.P.) and his then new sidekicks.\n\nThe fantastic artwork belongs to the best pictures of Ed Repka, despite or exactly because of the pink sky. I admit that this colour usually ornaments the nursery of a little girl, but here it builds the perfect contrast to the settlement of the lepers. The generation spotify will never understand the majestic might of a holistic approach. Come on guys, just drive your car without CD player and listen to whatever you want.\n\n\"Leprosy\" appears less furious and spontaneous than the famous debut. Its tracks are more controlled and possess a higher degree of maturity. Nevertheless, the evolutionary process remains manageable. Death do not break out of the frame they have set themselves when starting the band. The compositions just have a smooth flow, but this does not mean that the band has become a toothless monster. Neither the guitars nor the drums lack force. Producer Dan Johnson and engineer Scott Burns have forged a pretty perfect sound. Chuck's somewhat limited yet expressive voice comes into its own, the drums and the guitars meet each other as equal partners. In particular the drumming of Bill Andrews deserves attention, because he works with a high degree of precision, he uses the double bass to the right extent and his fill-ins shine with effectiveness.\n\nAs mentioned before, \"Leprosy\" has never been as impulsive as \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and maybe that's the reason why it failed to reach the status of a timeless classic. I am listening to an overwhelming work, but it cannot hide its date of birth. Unbelievable 31 years after its release, it is absolutely obvious that it originates from another time. But this supposed weakness is simultaneously the strength of the full-length. While Death's debut can be seen as the initial impulse for an entire prospering genre, their second album stands for its era. It avoids any kind of external influences, because there was just no reason to integrate some. The genre was still young and the approach of Death was highly original. No doubt, the quartet delivered the second blueprint for further publications. They did not focus on extremely low-tuned guitars and there was still a connection to the thrash scene. For example, Chuck's vocals are raw and mean, but he does not growl and so they would have also fit on a thrash album. Death metal was still in its infancy and Chuck's second monstrosity marks a milestone in its evolution. Thousands death metal albums followed, but I don't think that many of them are really comparable with \"Leprosy\", because they are more \"extreme\" and recorded by less competent musicians.\n\nBy the way, it was not only Chuck who made the album to something special. I have already mentioned Bill Andrews, but Rick Rozz also made a strong input. My personal highlight, \"Primitive Ways\", is written by him. Its fascinating guitars crush any form of disbelief, the solo is great and the most brutal side of the band emerges. Of course, the title track, penned by Chuck, does not stand in the shadow of this number and the compact \"Born Dead\" also hails from more or less the same level. Nevertheless, \"Primitive Ways\" has a very special flavour from my point of view. Yet it goes without saying that the album is filled to the brim with outstanding songs. The closer, for example, starts pretty slow, but it grows constantly and especially the gripping solo part raises a proper storm. Finally, Death were aware of the importance of a catchy part from time to time. The chorus of \"Forgotten Past\" illustrates this and separated the band from all those fools who thought that sole brutality is a value in itself.\n\n\"Leprosy\" constitutes a true monolith in view of its homogeneous overall appearance. It takes me back in time. Was everything better in the good old days? No, the Berlin Wall was still standing, I had to do my military service and information about metal bands were hard to find, because nobody already thought of a world wide web. Anyway, \"Leprosy\" stands for the good part of the past -and it doesn't matter that most cars also had no CD player back in 1988.\n",
        "\nDeath have a place in my metallic hall of fame, but it is much smaller than it could be. I always hated the evolution of the band after the third album. Chuck Schuldiner (R.I.P.), this brilliant inventor or at least co-inventor of death metal, began to betray his own supporters. This is my probably narrow-minded point of view. Yet there were no clouds at the sky when he released \"Scream Bloody Gore\". This album was the big bang of death metal and it has nothing lost of its relevance during the last three decades. Not only this, its reputation has constantly grown during all these years.\n\n\"Scream Bloody Gore\" sounds juvenile, carefree, explosive and dangerous. Okay, 32 years after its publication it is not that dangerous anymore. Yet it is great to see that it still has a fresh and impulsive touch. All songs open the gates widely to a then new metallic dimension and it is still a fantastic experience to realize how precisely the band, Schuldiner and Reifert, worked. Due to its early death metal vibrations, this output constitutes the album that picks up the aura of \"Seven Churches\" most successfully. Just like the songs on Possessed's unmatched debut, the here presented ten tracks rely on pretty conventional song structures, an accurate execution and demolishing vigour. The mix of some thrash elements and the brutality of the compositions comes close to the masterpiece of Beccera and his brothers in spirit. And there is another parallel between these two debuts. Both consist of flawless material, each and every song has more to say than only \"hello, I'm brutal\". A small number of nuances makes the pendulum swing in the direction of the songs on \"Seven Churches\", but the tracks of Death's debut do not lack personality, strength and class as well. \n\nMany parts of \"Scream Bloody Gore\" make my blood boil, for example the overwhelming solos which sound as furious as those on \"Reign in Blood\" while being somehow more melodic and structured than those on Slayer's last perfect work, The choruses are also absolutely deadly. Listen to that of the heavyweight \"Baptized in Blood\" or to the totally insane screaming that forms the chorus of \"Eviiiiiiiil Dead\". The guitar work of Chuck is also second to none, the ultimate mix of powerful speed, murderous sharpness and musical understanding. The aforementioned \"Evil Dead\" is the number that illustrates his skills most suitably, but actually one can choose each and every track in order to understand Schuldiner's technical and compositional excellence immediately. The somersaulting title track at the end of the running order bundles his competences for the final time and leaves nothing but a slavering crowd of maniacs that long for more. Its chorus infects you immediately - or you are simply immune against the beauty of devastating sounds.\n\nThe production gives no reason to complain, too. Maybe it does not reach the level of density that the successor of the debut showcased, but it spreads lively vibrations and it is well-balanced. I enjoy the guitar sound in particular, because it is sparkling and homicidal at the same time. Admittedly, it does not have this technical precision and murderous clarity that \"Seven Churches\" gave the final touch. Nevertheless, even today it does not sound outdated, although it maybe would have profited from 5% more violence. Be that as it may, I hope a gracious God will prevent the release of any remastered recordings. In general, \"Scream Bloody Gore\" sounds the way it should sound, no doubt about it.\n\nMany great bands have been heavily influenced by Death, but unfortunately not only by their debut. Pestilence, for instance, started very promisingly, but their miserable evolution which culminated in totally anaemic spheres is almost portraying the way Death took some years before. And it is therefore only logical that formations like Pestilence also have a smaller place in my heart than they could have. However, the first full-length of Chuck (R.I.P.) houses ten grenades and their murderous effect is still impressive. Just lend an ear to the hyper-dynamic chorus of \"Sacrificial\" or to the guitar lines of \"Zombie Ritual\", they convey stoical blood lust in the most excellent manner. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" has become a monument and marks nothing less than a nearly perfect debut in a row of comparably outstanding first works - \"Show No Mercy\", \"Bonded by Blood\", \"Seven Churches\"... hard to believe that any future decade will give birth to a comparable number of frenetic debuts. So what else can we do than listening to one of these classics from time to time, for example exactly Death's first work?\n",
        "\nI can't tell what is more difficult; trying to find flaws in this album or trying to find the words to describe how perfect it is.\n\nChuck Schuldiner has always been one to push the boundaries of music. From delivering the earliest prototypes of gory metal to enhancing extreme metal with progressive touches, Chuck was always thinking outside the box. On  Human,  Chuck and his brand new lineup of metal masters introduce a bold new direction that would carve the way for all subsequent Death albums.  Human  is filled with incredibly heavy riffs, technical rhythms, dark growls, and well written lyrics that stimulate the listener's mind. From the outright heavy \"Flattening of Emotions\", to the critical perspective of \"Lack of Comprehension\", to the strangely upbeat \"See Through Dreams\", Chuck and co. write a new blueprint for death metal. \n\nChuck has always been one to write great riffs. Death's early days spawned lethal riffs in the form of \"Mutilation\", \"Leprosy\", \"Choke On It\" and many others. But on  Human,  Chuck dials up the intensity. The aforementioned \"Flattening of Emotions\" is probably the heaviest riff Chuck has ever written. Combined with Sean Reinert's intense drumming, the main riff pounds the listener's ear drums with extremity and a newfound technicality unseen in previous Death efforts. What makes \"Flattening of Emotions\" an immediate standout is how well it links the old Death sound with a new twist. The songs on  Human  feel less rigid. The riffs are more creative, the instrumentation is more precise, and the solos are impressive as always. Anyone who is easily impressed by the one-two punch and powerful riffs and solos should listen to \"See Through Dreams\" and \"Vacant Planets\". The combination of riffs and solos feel more unique compared to those of previous Death albums.\n\nWhile Chuck uses some old lyrical themes on this album, he experiments with newer themes that eventually take over the remainder of the discography. Some songs like \"Suicide Machine\" and \"Together as One\" improve on past horror-based themes present on the  Leprosy  and  Spiritual Healing  records, while \"See Through Dreams\" and \"Vacant Planets\" introduce a new focus. \"See Through Dreams\" is an inspiring, positive take on a blind man's life, and how his dreams help him shape the world that surrounds him. \"Vacant Planets\" describes some odd theory only Chuck would write about, comparing humans to barren wastelands devoid of life. If there is one word any could use to describe Chuck Schuldiner, that word would be  visionary.  His new approach to his lyricism is also evident on \"Lack of Comprehension\", where he criticizes haters of metal.\n\nBehind these thought-provoking lyrics, the technical instrumentation of Chuck and Cynic guitarist Paul Masvidal fill the listener's ears with impressive riffs and melodies to draw in their attention. Steve Di Giorgio's bass occasionally stands out to enhance the darkness presented on each track. The best example of this atmospheric effect is present on Death's first ever instrumental, \"Cosmic Sea\". Although it is considerably less technical than the seven other beasts on this album, \"Cosmic Sea\" is a prime example of how much depth there is to Chuck's songwriting. The nightmarish tones of the guitars and bass combined with other effects prove that sometimes simplicity can write a good song.\n\nOverall,  Human  is the hands down the best album I have ever listened to. All 8 songs are nearly flawless with an effecitive combination of great riffs, solos, rhythms, and vocal work. It is a true death metal masterpiece that I recommend to anyone who wants to explore the realm of metal.\n\nFioridz's favourites: \"Flattening of Emotions\", \"Lack of Comprehension\", \"See Through Dreams\"\n\nRIP Chuck\n",
        "\nWith what is arguably Death's strongest (and shortest lived) lineup, Chuck Schuldiner released \"Human\" on October 22, 1991. The album features Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal, who would go on to create their own masterpieces with Cynic, and journeyman bassist Steve Di Giorgio; together with Schuldiner, the four crafted an unrelenting, brutal, yet introspective record that changed the landscape of death metal. \n\nThe structure of \"Human\" takes the listener from a human perspective and launches them into space to see the universe. However, transcending from the human form comes at a cost, and Death punishes the listener with an onslaught. The opening riff of the album on Flattening of Emotions is a contender for one of the top intros in metal history, as sinister guitar work weaves itself into Reinert's galloping drum intro. From flattened emotions, the listener is broken down with tracks like Suicide Machine and Together as One, tracks dealing with human suffering and with grotesque imagery of human entanglement. With each track, Death launches us higher into the cosmic plane; Secret Face describes the lucid nature of reality, and Lack of Comprehension, arguably one of Death's best songs, compels the listener to realize how little they understand about themself, and their own mistakes. Lack of Comprehension can be seen as the midway point towards the journey from reality to infinity; the intro is more slow-paced, spacey, and a step away from the machine-like riffage in the first twenty minutes of the album. \n\nSee Through Dreams is the point where the listener fades out of reality; at the end of the track, the song fades into a flat blanket of noise. It's one of the coolest production choices on the album, and demonstrates how progressive and ahead of its time Death was for paying attention to how their albums were mixed and produced. It's one of many reasons why \"Human\" has aged so well, almost thirty years later. Cosmic Sea, an insturmental where bass solos, ambient electronic music, and Sean Reinert's jazzy accentuations all mix themselves in death metal fashion, helps bring the listener to the Vacant Planets, where Chuck asks us to ponder \"so many worlds yet to be seen that once have shared the same effects that come from greed, mass production.\" As we continue to kill our world, \"Human\" asks us to take a step away from our bodies and to consider what it means to live, and what it costs to be human. \n\nNone of this would be achievable between the epic and masterful playing from Reinert and Masvidal, who were teenagers when they recorded Human. Masvidal's guitar work creates the veneer of complexity that Chuck was missing from his earlier albums, and his solos on Flattening of Emotions, Vacant Planets, and Lack of Comprehension are ear candy. Reinert's drumming inserts a hint of jazz that would not only define technical death metal playing but would also be developed heavily by his successor, Gene Hoglan, and Reinert's work on \"Human\" should be celebrated for prototyping the drumming methods of a whole generation of drum players. His double kicks and complex drum patterns remain, almost thirty years later, virtually unmatched in precision and technique. And Steve Di Giorgio shines with some epic bass interludes peppered in the empty space between the violent and machine-like riffs that bury the listener throughout the album. \n\n\"Human\" presents Death at its most dynamic and creative. While the albums that follow might be heavier (Individual Though Patterns) more complex (Symbolic) or more progressive (The Sound of Perseverance), \"Human\" provides the blueprint for the genre of technical death metal, and to this day I believe it is not only one of the most influential metal records ever written -- it's also one of the best. Thirty years later its lyrics are as relevant as ever, and it invites the listener to be brutalized out of this world and into the universe to ponder human suffering and human nature.\n",
        "\nI got into Death a lot later than most people. This gave me a chance to listen to their entire discography and pick out my favorite albums. This album was definitely a step in the right direction by the band for me. Personally, I enjoy lyrics that involve real world issues. Death metal that is all about killing and torture gets boring to me. I like when a band talks about shit that's worth talking about. Listening to \"Scream Bloody Gore\" for the first time, I didn't think they were capable of that. The more I listened to Spiritual Healing though, the more I appreciated it in all its forms. \n\nThe first thing that grabs my attention is that amazing artwork. Right away you know that this album is about. Everything from the fanatic looking people, to the money in the preacher's pocket. You know for sure which direction these lyrics will be headed. Those lyrics are also written very well. For a death metal album, they really can make you think. For example, the lyrics on Living Monstrosity talk about a baby being born addicted to cocaine and it being all fucked up looking. Later on in the album, the lyrics bring up abortion and mental illness. These aren't your typical death metal lyrics, especially from the early 90s. I applaud Death not only for their lyrics, but the song writing as well. \n\nWhile Death has some unimpressive rhythm and bass guitar work on this album, the way it is executed in these songs is masterful. Defensive Personalities is a song that warrants headbanging through almost the entire song. Especially after the lyrics, \"Protecting the weak points of the mind, Defensive Personalities.\" Same thing goes for the title track, \"Spiritual Healing\". The guitar and bass is very interesting on this tune and switches it up more than most of the other songs on here. This album is not about speed and the instrumentals really match the lyrics and overall tone of the album perfectly. Killing Spree is a great finisher to the album. The solo mid-way through the song is one of the highlights of the entire album for me. The drumming by Bill Andrews is something that really stands out for me on all songs because it compliments each tune perfectly. \n\nI always put this album on when I want some very structured death metal. I enjoy the lyrics and the guitar work is a bit slowed down making it easy to listen to. While this album is not as good as Symbolic or Sound of Perseverance, it's still a must listen to if you are a death metal fan. Death was really going a different direction than their first two releases and the way they approached that was to mature up a little bit.\n\nRecommendations on here are: Living Monstrosity, Defensive Personalities, Spiritual Healing and Killing Spree.\n",
        "\nI remember when I first heard the phrase \u201cadventure metal\u201d; guitarist Chris Letchford used it to describe his band Scale the Summit. And it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t see where he\u2019s coming from, either. Scale the Summit use atmosphere and shifts in mood to take you on a journey, an expedition of sorts. At the same time, though, it\u2019s not like they were the first band to come up with such a concept; countless acts, from Opeth to Gojira, have gone great lengths to make their music feel more like an excursion than mere tracklists. But today, we\u2019re going to talk about a band who had to evolve to get to this point: the almighty metal giants Death. To put it simply, it\u2019s hard to believe that the same band that wrote such a primal display of death metal fury as Scream Bloody Gore could come up with an incredible mixture of aggression and sophistication. Despite this, Symbolic proved to be the pinnacle of Death\u2019s steady evolution into the realm of progressive extreme metal. With a new lineup of guitarist Bobby Koelble, bassist Kelly Conlon, and returning drummer Gene Hoglan, Chuck was ready to redefine metal once again\u2026 this time achieving the strongest results.\n\nFrom the opening notes of the title track, Symbolic sounds like a daunting undertaking, as if you\u2019re actually scaling a mountain. Those monumental octave-jumping riffs, combined with the classically-inclined melodies arched above, show just how much Chuck Schuldiner has grown as a songwriter over the years. It\u2019s not enough anymore to just have meaty, brutal riffs, but now they\u2019re all embellished with little ornaments that flesh out the atmosphere and diversity of the recording. That melodic opening riff in \u201cWithout Judgment\u201d sounds pretty cool; what more could they add? Well, some intricate and progressive drum fills courtesy of Gene Hoglan should do the trick. That chunky Drop-D intro to \u201cCrystal Mountain\u201d is aggressive and driving; how about that one? Get Schuldiner and Bobby Koelble to bring in some classical harmonies straight out of a Dream Theater album to round it out! Despite the progressive influences, however, the technicality and ambition never get overbearing to the point that they get in the way of a good riff or a good groove. On top of that, songs like \u201cMisanthrope\u201d and \u201c1,000 Eyes\u201d still pay respect to the band\u2019s thrash-driven past with harsh and relentless arrangements that round out the variety on Symbolic.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get back to that first statement I made: the one regarding \u201cadventure metal.\u201d That may sound like a really stupid term (and, to be honest, I\u2019d agree), but it\u2019s still a great way to describe Symbolic. The way each song shifts and adjusts to each change in mood and tone is ridiculously natural, and gives off the true sense of embarking on a journey. \u201cPerennial Quest\u201d is probably the best example, especially in how it concludes the record with a soft acoustic portion that somehow doesn\u2019t sound out-of-place on a Death album (then again, there\u2019s also \u201cVoice of the Soul\u201d...). Many of the riffs and melodies here are adorned with an emotional punch that\u2019s lacking in a lot of today\u2019s technical metal; just listen to the quiet introduction to \u201cEmpty Words\u201d and the subtle melancholy it wrings out of the clean guitar progression. On a similar note, check out the beautiful clean section of \u201cSacred Serenity,\u201d which provides a nice contemplative break from the metal frenzy without breaking too far away from the band\u2019s signature style. The lyrics are equally thought-provoking too, touching on themes of religion, hypocrisy, deceit, misanthropy, as well as many depictions of inner contemplation and soul-searching. The poetry on the record brings nice accompaniment to the more advanced musical arrangements, to say the least.\n\nDeath\u2019s followup The Sound of Perseverance might be even more adventurous, and Individual Thought Patterns might have been more technical, but neither of them pulled these qualities together as meaningfully as Symbolic did. If you were to ask me why Symbolic works so well, I could answer that in just a few words: songwriting and storytelling. They sound like simple ingredients, but Death elevated them to such lofty heights that very few death metal or progressive metal bands could keep up with the sheer ambition and focus of this epic. Symbolic is beautiful, immersive, elaborate, brutal, and a stunning testament to just how emotionally and artistically accomplished heavy metal can be.\n",
        "\nWhat is death metal? That's a big question and one that has been argued over countless times. I'm not the biggest fan of the genre, nor do I particularly care about whether Possessed got there first or whether Death's debut full-length Scream Bloody Gore was death metal in the true sense, but what I do know is this - Leprosy has everything that death metal really needs. With almost every type of extreme metal, there is a certain conviction that a band needs to play it and be believed and that conviction comes oozing off the eight songs here.\n\nWhat tells me that this is really death metal is not that it sounds dark all the time or that the lyrics could be part of a drinking game about how many times you can mention demise, simply that the band rip into every song like tearing a cadaver's head off its softening body. This is brutal and relentless: it needs very little of the slow, sick grind that Autopsy had or the graphic extremism of Cannibal Corpse, nor even the relentless speed of outfits like Sadus and Possessed; Leprosy is just brutal in a way that continues to flay your ears and kick your arse from start to finish. There's definitely something to be said about Chuck Schuldiner's guitar playing, the scythe of his quicker riffs blurring through the air like throwing stars slicing through your curtains and into your bedroom, while the grunting click of the bass keeps relentless pace as Bill Andrews on drums blasts forwards with all the force of a concrete freight train, gaining atmosphere and potency from the reverby mix. That some of the mid-paced riffs on the title track and 'Left to Die' crash in like heavyweight thrash breaks only confirms how right Sodom were on Persecution Mania, because those sections are twice as heavy and ten times as fun as the chaos elsewhere, plus perfect candidates for memorable highlights.\n\nWhen one gets into specifics about the songs on Leprosy, the development of Schuldiner's formula is simply frightening compared to other bands of the same era. The manner in which 'Pull the Plug' manages to include the hooky churning riff that leads it off, the slower chugging refrain that leads back into the same hook with blasts, and some melodic guitar acrobatics that still sound \"other\" while making consonant sense in the same manner as Iron Maiden's guitarists is - like this overlong sentence - rather a stretch to fully comprehend, since there has rarely been music made that is both this heavy and so easy to distinguish throughout its progress. All of the songs on the album have something similar to those notable features from 'Pull the Plug', whether that be the astounding guitar + bass solo on 'Born Dead', the climactic riffing of 'Open Casket' as Schuldiner roars out the title, or those skullfucking riffs that I've already mentioned. And, in case you're doubting the overall quality of the album, every song has a riff that would make me punch out Mike Tyson without second thoughts. You know, if he happened to knock on the door.\n\nOther than those features, it seems rather pointless to also froth over the quality of the leads, but for a genre that sets such store by James Murphy and Trey Azagthoth, Schuldiner and partner in shred Rick Rozz (not quite the death metal name one envisages) do a sterling job at whipping up not only the furies of hell with some squealing noise breaks, but also much more intricate leads that leave 'Forgotten Past' unlikely to be forgotten in the near future and lend 'Choke On It' a structuredly chaotic strike towards its end. That final song does deviate slightly from the trend of the rest of the album, focusing on some slower melodies and morbid heavy metal riffing, though it suits the album to end on a different note. The only song that underwhelms in part is 'Forgotten Past', which opens in a style too thrashy and chuggy to match the intensity and mood of the surrounding extremity, though only the first minute suffers in this regard. There are also a few parts of songs that blend into one another, since the faster verses often have similar styles that Andrews blasts through, thus leaving the identity slightly indistinct. For the most part, however, Leprosy is a fearsome and exhilarating album that has barely aged since its release almost 30 years ago. It almost makes me want to shake the cover's hooded figure by the hand.\n",
        "\nIndividual Thought Patterns was Death's first true foray into the realm of technical death metal. The Human record moved in this direction but the change was fully realized with the release of 1993's classic album. There are no bad tracks on this album, none deserving of skipping or fast-forwarding. This album is fast-paced, intense, and often extremely musically complicated. All the guitar riffs are executed with such a high degree of precision that is astonishing. This album also featured Steve DiGeorgio on bass, leading to some tasty bass lines and a few sick solos. Andy LaRocque of King Diamond contributed his guitar finesse as well with several of what could be considered Death's finest solos. This killer roster of musicians is made even more impressive by the presence of the drumming monster, Gene Hoglan. There are frequent displays of sickeningly fast blast beats and insanely technical drumming. But of course Individual Thought Patterns would not be what it is without the mastermind himself, Chuck Schuldiner.\n\nThis album is a well recorded, no holds barred, balls out death metal onslaught. It features of few of their most iconic tracks like The Philosopher, Trapped in a Corner, and Overactive Imagination. This really is a truly classic album and most certainly worth a listen. This record and Human in my mind stand as what is the iconic Death sound. The previous 4 albums can be seen building to this point, and its clear how this was the stepping stone for the last 2 releases they would bring.\n\nTo me, Individual Thought Patterns was the height of Death's mastery. All of their albums are classic and influential, but for me 1993's Individual Thought Patterns serves as a landmark for death metal. It has elements that that can be heard in many genres of death metal that have developed since then. Traces of melodic, progressive, technical, and even symphonic metal can be heard throughout this collection of unbelievable tracks. Chuck Schuldiner raised the bar for death metal with writing this album. The arrangements of the songs flow seamlessly together, taking the listener on an emotional and intellectual journey. The furious, blazing riffs and powerful solos deliver enough shredding to make any metal fan bang their head. Supported by the rest of this killer lineup Chuck crafted this release into one of the most powerful and iconic death metal albums of all time.\n",
        "\nThe Sound of Perseverance was my first Death album. I was 15 at the time, with the anatomical and mental maturity of the average 13 year old, and the uplifting, motivational themes of most of these songs struck a resonant chord with me. I listened to this quite a bit, and it was at the time one of the few death metal albums I could tolerate. Little did I know, however, of Death's true masterpieces - Scream Bloody Gore, Human, Individual Thought Patterns, and Symbolic. I deified this album, in a way, and I wrote a draft here heavily praising it. A few years later, let's see what I think of it...\n\nEvery band that exists for longer than a decade has a turning point where they stop releasing original classics and begin churning out self-derivative material, copying their own characteristics to appease devoted fans. From what I can tell, the Sound of Perseverance would have been the start of that had Death continued on. Maybe it was just a flop album, but the recycled riffs and pandering lyrical themes firmly tell me otherwise. Both \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" and \"Voice of the Soul\" (an instrumental which I will further explain later on) reuse riffs from \"Out of Touch\" from Individual Thought Patterns. Maybe this signals that the masterwork of Death's classic albums was ephemeral; something which had to have a logical conclusion - Symbolic. Instead, Sound of Perseverance perpetuates the same technical death metal sound beyond its farthest extent, rather than taking the band somewhere new.\n\nLack of originality aside, Death's final album still showcases the talents of the band. Amidst some of the shitty alternative rock inspired melodies that scream \"90s\", there is the same blistering technicality heard on prior albums. Listen to the way the opener \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" begins with insane drumming and shredding. Also expressed here is Death's softer side, which permeated the brutality in songs like \"Crystal Mountain\" on the previous album. \"Voice of the Soul\" is a three and a half minute long instrumental. It consists merely of a beautiful acoustic melody and layered lead guitar. It is somewhat minimalistic in regard to the instruments used, but with only guitars, a lot is accomplished in the way of creating a grandiloquent atmosphere. Easily the best song on the album, there is no understating what the listener will feel in this. Sadly, it is buried in the middle of Death's worst album.\n\nBack on a negative note again, Chuck Schuldiner's vocals have continued their transition from deep growls to higher screams. I really liked his sound on the last album; the high end growls reminded me somewhat of David Vincent on Altars of Madness. They are even higher here, but they sound weak, as if his unfortunate illness was afflicting his voice early on. Maybe it's not his fault that the vocals here aren't up to Death's standard, but in any case they rub me the wrong way with their lack of charismatic aggression. Also lacking in aggression are some of the riffs. My least favorite is that alt rock melody from \"Story to Tell\". It's too soft for a death metal song, and it borders on melodeath territory to me. Riff wise, this album is really a mixed bag. As a final criticism, the album drags a bit, especially at the beginning and at the end due to its stylistic and thematic redundancy - the songs are very similar, and the lyrics seem to all cater to the same types of people-those who listen to nu-metal.\n\nWhile The Sound of Perseverance is in no way a bad album, it no longer resonates with me, and I would go as far as to say that it is Death's worst release. That doesn't necessarily mean that the typical fan wouldn't enjoy it, in fact on the contrary. However, understand that this is not classic Death at its finest.\n",
        "\nThe Sound Of Perseverance is possibly the greatest metal album ever made.\n\nWell, I think so.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is not a death metal album. Sure, it's by Death, a death metal band, but this particular album falls out of the genre. The vocals aren't death metal, the riffs aren't death metal, the writing isn't death metal, the lyrics don't reflect anything remotely death metal... there's even an acoustic instrumental. Whereas all of Death's later albums are death metal first with elements of progressive metal (some with more prog than others), TSOP is entirely a progressive metal album, nothing more and nothing less. Now, is this something like Risk by Megadeth? No, because whereas Risk is a blatant cash-grab uninspired by a muddy cess of anti-creativity, TSOP shows that a band doesn't have to stay within its genre field to be amazing.\n\nHowever, the music itself is downright beautiful. This is easily the most emotional and soul-driven Death album. Every single riff on this album is filled with emotion and passion. Chuck Schuldiner originally wanted to PULL THE PLUG on the band Death and intended Symbolic to be his final album before moving onto his solo project, Control Denied. The label said they would only produce his solo band if he made one more Death album, but also said he was able to do whatever he wanted with the album as long as it had the Death name on it. Tired of the same old boring death metal, Chuck took the opportunity to go completely nuts, and this album shows. So much creativity and originality went into this album that it is truly one of a kind. One moment, you're soaring above the celestial plain, the next you're being thrown into a mosh pit with an insane neckbreaker riff, and then you'll find yourself on the verge of tears with some moments that sound almost nostalgic and personal. Songs like \"The Flesh and the Power It Holds\" and \"Scavenger Of Human Sorrow\" are absolute epics that scale many different riffs, time signatures, and emotions in the same way the galaxy spans many different planets and solar systems. Tracks like \"Bite The Pain\" kick your ass into shape with sudden tempo-changing riffs that smash you in the face like a hammer, while \"Painkiller\" is what a T-80 tank with a rocket jet engine would sound like if it were in metal form. There's even a slight jazzy influence painted across the entire album, most prominent on tracks like the opener and \"To Forgive Is To Suffer\", and the jazz fusion mixes surprisingly well with blistering metal production and riffs to create some of the catchiest riffs known to mankind. \n\nThe musicianship is nothing short of incredible. Drummer Richard Christy admitted that, because he was a huge fanboy of Chuck Schuldiner and wanted to impress him as much as possible, he basically did one giant drum solo throughout the entire album. There isn't a single second where Christy isn't going absolutely insane on his drum kit, while also masterfully maintaining sudden time signature changes with stunning precision. Bassist Scott Clendenin also rips away on his fretless bass and has many solo moments, like on \"Spirit Crusher\" and \"A Story To Tell\". The guitars steal the show here, as Chuck and Shannon Hamm, who has a very similar style to Chuck that almost can't be distinguished from each other, bleed their entire sous into their strings, going less for typical chugs and open E-string thrashers and more akin to something you'd write for a fallen friend. The solo to \"A Moment Of Clarity\" sounds akin to the music form of climbing the mountain on the cover of the album, and it's probably one of the greatest solos ever written. Above anything else though is Chuck Schuldiner's vocals. Instead of your basic low death metal growl, Chuck decided, for whatever reason, to experiment with a high pitched black metal screech. These vocals are amazing and blend very well with the music, also adding onto the one-of-a-kind sound. The vocal technique sounds as if any normal human being would've either spit blood into a glass cup after each verse or had some sort of serious condition, and it's beautiful.\n\nIt's clear that this album may go over some heads. One reviewer on this site even claimed the opener, \"Scavenger Of Human Sorrow\", began with \"...a beat you would find on some urban gangsta rap album...\" and I respect opinions, but something like that is flat out wrong. I wasn't aware that most urban gangsta rap beats composed of wild drum solos written in the 9/8 time signature, as the opening to that song is. Those who are looking for death metal will most likely be perturbed by TSOP, as there is no death metal to be found here. If you want a heavy-as-hell metal album that manages to be unique and unpredictable, you've found the right album. I discovered this album as an 8th grader, sitting on the edge of my bed, listening to Pandora shuffle when the opener came onto the playlist. I've been in love ever since.\n",
        "\nThis is probably my favorite album of all time. It has everything you could want in a metal album, speed, heaviness, melody, aggression, variety, and fantastic musicianship. This was the third Death album I had ever listened too, and this one totally blew me away.\n\nThe guitar is probably the highlight of the album, it's just fucking fantastic. From the incredible mid-paced riffs in the opener to the fast and thrashy speed of \"To Forgive is to Suffer\" to the incredible instrumental \"Voice of the Soul\", this album has mind blowing riffs throughout. I will say that every song on this album has catchy and memorable riffs. It's full of those riffs where you can't just have it as background noise, it commands your attention while you sit there in awe of the orgasmic sounds pumping through your speakers. The rest of the album is great, but you can really tell just how amazing of a guitar player Schuldiner really was. The highlight of this album as far as the guitar goes is for sure Voice of the Soul, a slow ballad that's utterly amazing. The drumming simply it's well done and interesting, very atypical for death metal. It's very progressive and uses techniques that aren't common in death metal. It's almost jazzy, it's hard to describe. The same goes for the song structure of this whole album, it's varied and constantly changing, you've definitely got some of the standard death metal beats in it, but for the most part it's very original. There are a few very nice drum solos scattered around the album that keep things interesting.\n\n\"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" starts off with Christy beating the piss out of his drums. Then turns into some complex riffing, and then you know it's death due to Chuck's vocals, that have improved on this disc. The drumming is spectacular and the guitars are accurate as hell. This song will pump up any metalhead. One of the best songs. \"Bite the Pain\" gives me the fucking chills. Such a great song I can't explain it in mere words. Chucks lyrics are genuine as per usual on this song, speaking of wounds inside someone soul. \"Flesh and The Power It Holds\", for some reason this song reminds me of how sad Chucks death was for his fans. It feels like a very sorrowful song, and whenever I heard this one I can't help but think that Chuck wrote this song for someone he cared for dearly. \u201cPainkiller\u201d is a Judas Priest cover that takes off right away with a nice drum intro. They do a great job with the cover although it's hard to duplicate Halford's vocals, Chucks gives it his all.\n\nChuck's vocals are fucking sweet. At some point Chuck decided to change his style a bit, he moves from the guttural vocals to a more high-pitched, shrieking. It's still great though, perfect for this albums style. The lyrics are about spiritual things though, unlike Death's early albums, they don't talk about violence and gore. That can be a bad thing for some people I guess, but again, I think it really fits the music on the album. Going on about gore and death just wouldn't work with the overall mood of the album. It's too deep and thoughtful.\n\nI love this album, other than the bass being too low I can't find anything wrong with it at all. It is full of memorable riffs, and eargasms are plentiful. There is not one dry spot or boring moment in the entire album. People may be turned off by Chuck's different vocal style, but trust me on this you will grow to accept and love it. I would buy this album again in a heartbeat and I've bought it for a few friends. It's just that fucking good. It isn't one of albums you buy to have on in the background, it's one that you listen to with full attention.\n",
        "\nDeath\u2019s genre-defining debut album gets the remastered treatment in this Relapse reissue, but there would be understandable doubts about meddling with such a seminal record. Rest-assured, the job done here serves \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d no injustice. The bass absolutely rips and bounces along nicely to Chuck\u2019s identifiable and uncompromisingly brutal riffs, whilst none of the originals raw intensity and energy is lost.\n\nOnto the album itself and its grittiness becomes apparent immediately with the swirling \u201cInfernal Death,\u201d and from there on in Death never lets you go, Chuck Schuldiner\u2019\u2019s inimitable growls and guitar licks taking you on a nightmare trip though a Romero-styled horror infested world. This theme plays throughout. Whilst the lyrics can come across a little too cheesy at times, the music overcomes this, especially apparent in the brooding entrance to \u2018Zombie Ritual\u2019 and \u2018Evil Dead\u2019 especially sounding like a particularly virtuosic and brutal horror film soundtrack. Whilst the entire album retains a certain cohesive sound, the songs here all stand alone. Perhaps not surprising considering the years and line-up changes it took to create this record and the back catalogue of tunes Chuck already had to his name by this point, they are nevertheless all astoundingly good. From the riff-driven chorus of \u2018Denial of Life\u2019 which makes you instantly bang your head to the darkness that comes from \u2018Baptized in Blood\u2019, a track which really feels like it's about to come off the tracks, this is an album ram packed with hooks, riffs and solos that always compliment each other. Worth noting here also is Chris Reifert\u2019s drumming. Never to again grace a Death record, his work is simply fantastic, with punishing rhythms and full of fun fills that I felt \u2018Leprosy\u2019 missed.\n\nThere remains an argument that Possessed\u2019s \u201cSeven Churches\u201d can claim the mantel of being death metal\u2019s first album, yet whilst that record was a glimpse of what was to come in the scene and demonstrated a thrash/death transition it is here that the genre\u2019s parameters were truly set. Not only is its influence immeasurable, but all the songs on here stood the test of time. So many of the tracks here have echoes of future bands, such as the Dismember-esque intro to Sacrificial, yet it is in the songwriting that this album\u2019s magic lies. A much more straightforward approach than later albums, this allows the tunes to be both instantly memorable and rewarding on repeat listens.\n\nThis is a nice reissue, and the two bonus tracks on the album slide in perfectly. They were only removed originally because Combat wanted a shorter running time and are just as good as any of the other ten tracks. However, the fact that the second discs rehearsals and original Florida session recordings only contain one unique song in \u201cLegion of Doom\u201d means anyone who owns an older release may not feel the need to pick this one up too. Nevertheless, to anyone who doesn\u2019t yet own this record, it is a death metal classic that every fan of the genre should have.\n",
        "\nIt is widely known by most metalheads who are loyal devotees of the extreme metal genre that before there was Death they were formerly called as Mantas. Under the name Mantas the band released three rehearsal tapes, along with a live tape, before deciding to change their name to Death in late 1984 and finally releasing this five track demo \"Death By Metal\".\n\nThis magnum opus of a demo was the band's first record released under the name Death, and this also serves as the ancestor of what we now know as the death metal genre. Now I know a lot would react to my statement about this demo being the blood lineage of the death metal genre because of the album being loaded with a number of thrashy elements, but this was totally ahead of its time when it comes to distinguishing what was defined as thrash metal during that era.\n\nEvery track in this demo is more anarchic, ponderous, blistering and intense in abhorrence than most thrash metal albums that were coming out during those times. The demo contains the resonance of early Slayer materials, yet it is more murky and vile when it comes to the delivery. With the twin guitar combination of Chuck Schuldiner and Rick Rozz, each piece in the demo is filled with relentless riffs and killer shredding solos. The vocal work of Kam Lee (Kam's drumming is also to my liking in this release, as it hammers and pummels throughout the whole demo), that along with Chuck's astonishing shrieks, also slays in this demo.\n\nThere really is nothing to say more about this record for it is plausibly one of the best early extreme metal records that the band had recorded in their career. This is highly recommended to any fans of raw and old school extreme metal music. This is totally a must listen and must own record. Cheers to the pioneers of the death metal genre! Hail to sir Chuck Schuldiner! You are truly missed in the mortal world Evil Chuck.\n",
        "\nLet\u2019s visit the past again. Here\u2019s a classic Death album \u201cLeprosy\u201d. Oh, I think it\u2019s the first death metal album which I\u2019ve ever heard and it was 25-26 years ago or something like that. You can imagine how many times have I listened it since then. Hundreds? I know every riffs, every vocals line \u2013 this album has no secrets before me anymore. This is a reason why I don\u2019t play it so often these days and I prefer to put something new instead (like Gruesome or Skeletal Remains), because I don\u2019t feel this excitement when I hear \u201cLeprosy\u201d anymore. This album will surely remain a total classic for me and I will always consider it as one of the best death metal records of all time. But not as Death\u2019s finest album, because I like \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d more. This one is their second best IMO.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s been one year since the band has brutally mutilated every metalhead with \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d and \u201cLeprosy\u201d was released in 1988. There\u2019s been quite significant line up change \u2013 only Chuck Schuldiner remained on the altar of gore. He was joined by his old Mantas pal Rick Rozz on guitar, as well some other Massacre members \u2013 Bill Andrews on drums and Terry Butler on bass. But Butler joined the band shortly after the recording session of \u201cLeprosy\u201d, so he\u2019s here just on the photos (Chuck recorded all bass lines). Interestingly, the line up here is almost the same, as on the three years later recorded \u201cFrom Beyond\u201d, but that\u2019s another story. \n\n\u201cLeprosy\u201d definitely shows a great progression and improvement with songwriting and technical aspects. You can hear that the songs are better composed, with lots of brilliant arrangements, more detailed guitar work, drums parts and everything else. Primitive gory death metal was moved along to Autopsy with Reifert, while Death took a huge step forward. Both Schuldiner and Rozz showed some great guitar work here, came up great heavy riffs, fantastic leads or quite a lot of melody for such an aggressive death metal album. They\u2019ve been both equally responsible for composing \u201cLeprosy\u201d, most of the songs were written by two of them and only two tracks (two BEST songs on the album \u2013 \u201cLeprosy\u201d and \u201cPull the Plug\u201d) were composed solely by Chuck and one song (\u201cPrimitive Ways\u201d, which is also my least fave track here) was written only by Rick Rozz. More mature, much more developed and though through \u2013 this is what you\u2019ll think, if you compare \u201cLeprosy\u201d to \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d. Every song bursts with great brutal energy, but surprisingly a lot of these riffs are quite catchy and memorable, which is something that will always differ Death from other, more brutal US death metal acts. Obviously it\u2019s not the ultra-progressive and innovatory Death songs yet, so do not expect \u201cHuman\u201d from it. This album is closer to such \u201cPleasure to Kill\u201d for instance than to \u201cSymbolic\u201d and \u201cHuman\u201d. It\u2019s aggressive, often relatively fast and still rather harsh sounding, but the production is very strong aspect of this album.\n\nI have two really favourite songs here \u2013 first one is the title track, which may even be my favourite Death song ever. Oh, I love the riffs in it, that heaviness, harshness, melodies and the vicious atmosphere of \u201cLeprosy\u201d. This song has also quite memorable parts, it basically is one of those songs, where every riff is nailing you to the ground and crushing immediately. And the second fave piece is \u201cPull the Plug\u201d, of course! Wow, this is such a killer, I\u2019m sure that everyone knows this track, as it\u2019s probably one of Death\u2019s most popular anthems. This song is relatively easy, when speaking of its structure, arrangements and everything. But it\u2019s so bloody effective, slower parts in it are absolutely fantastic, guitar leads are perfect and yet again the music is very memorable, you will remember its chorus or some of these killer riffs forever. \n\nBut there are more exceptional songs, like \u201cLeft to Die\u201d, \u201cChoke on It\u201d and \u201cOpen Casket\u201d, so the whole 40 minutes always go fast. It\u2019s not a perfect record, it\u2019s not the best death metal album (although an important one in my personal ranking and my death metal history). It has its faults, especially the drums, as I don\u2019t really like the monotonous drumming of Andrews, who especially in the faster parts seem to be playing the same patterns over and over again. But his playing seems to fit that old school death metal character of \u201cLeprosy\u201d, so it is not a major complain. More so, the snare drum sound is almost annoying sometimes, but I can live with that. All in all, it\u2019s been almost 30 years since \u201cLeprosy\u201d was recorded and this album didn\u2019t get old at all, I still listen to it with smile on my face and with a great pleasure. And I am sure that in another 20 years it will make the same impression, because this is a timeless album.\n\nStandout tracks: \u201cLeprosy\u201d, \u201cPull the Plug\u201d, \u201cOpen Casket\u201d, \u201cLeft to Die\u201d\nFinal rate: 90/100\n",
        "\nThis is a timeless release. This is a fundamental death metal album. This is also the FIRST death metal album that was ever released (yes, I consider \u201cSeven Churches\u201d more thrash metal, if any of these genre tags matter at all). And if there are albums that really \u2013 and I mean REALLY \u2013 deserve being called \u201cclassics\u201d or \u201ccult\u201d, then \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d is among them. These are indisputable facts. It may not be the best album of all time, it\u2019s not even my favourite Death record (as I prefer \u201cLeprosy\u201d and \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d way more), but it had an enormous influence on the entire scene and belongs to genre defining albums.\n\nI can only imagine how strange it had to be to see these 20 years old kids recording such filth and singing about cunts, zombie rituals and other disgusting, repulsive things. But they did it! It was 1987 when two youngsters \u2013 Chuck Schuldiner and Chris Reifert \u2013 recorded \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d. There was also a third band member, John Hand, but his place in history of extreme music is limited only to the photo on back of the vinyl, as he didn\u2019t record even one part of bass or guitar. What an unlucky dude haha!\n\n\u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d was released by Combat Records in 1987. Personally, I\u2019ve heard it for the first time in 1991. It was actually quite funny, but I bought a cassette with the \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d cover, but the tape was mistaken with \u201cScream\u2026\u201d, so for some months I didn\u2019t even realize that what I listened to was \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d haha! One of the things for which I love this record is the fantastic artwork. It\u2019s superb and one of the most classic artworks in metal history! Obviously the lyrics are something a lot of people moan about. They hate their primitive and vulgar nature, they hate this gory style and for them it\u2019s just stupid, childish and nonsense crap. Well, who cares. \u201cRevengeful corpses out to kill. Smell the stench, your guts will spill. Vomit for a mind, maggots for a cock. With his axe the corpse will chop\u2026\u201d Ha, what nice stuff. Death metal is not a place for romantic poetry, so I don\u2019t understand people moaning about brutal, gory lyrics. I actually prefer them over the philosophical or social topics, which you can find on some other Death albums.\n\nNow the music. First I have to say that I love the production of \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d. If we have to compare this record to \u201cSeven Churches\u201d, then Death\u2019s debut kicks the shit out of Possessed, not only musically, but also due to much better, heavier, more aggressive and darker production. It had to be tricky to come up with a sound which would be proper for such brutal music. But it had to be done, because this music would not work with a simple thrash metal production. It required something different and the band succeeded fully. And the songs are superb. This is Death and death metal in its infancy, so don\u2019t expect it to sound technical, clean and progressive. Do not expect that \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d will have much in common with \u201cHuman\u201d or \u201cSymbolic\u201d. If you\u2019re a fan of the latter Death albums, this debut may be difficult for you to get into, as it\u2019s way more primitive, harsh and just nasty sounding death metal. It\u2019s full of gore and horror, dark and almost macabre atmosphere. And for me personally it all sounds super fantastic. I love many of these songs and no matter how many times I\u2019ve listened to them, they just don\u2019t get old and boring. I still get thrills when some of these riffs mutilate and cut deep and some of these songs belong to the most recognizable death metal tracks of all time. We have here such killers as \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d, \u201cEvil Dead\u201d, \u201cSacrificial\u201d, \u201cRegurgitated Guts\u201d or \u201cMutilation\u201d. Some of them are very vicious and quite fast sounding, others may have slower riffage and even some harmonies, which will later become trademark for Schuldiner's style of playing and Death. For example the opening melodies for \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d and \u201cEvil Dead\u201d \u2013 they are so memorable and fantastic sounding!\n\nSoooo\u2026 I don\u2019t have to write that if you\u2019re into this style of music, you just have to take a sip from the goblet of gore at least once. If you don\u2019t like its taste, then you must be either a poser or you\u2019re simply out of your fuckin mind. It\u2019s an essential release and mandatory item for everyone\u2019s collection. I have Under One Flag\u2019s 1987 European version of \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d. Obviously it is awesome to have this press, I've had it for many years and will never get rid of it. There\u2019s one thing which I hate about it, though. It doesn\u2019t have two additional songs that appeared on other pressings of \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d. \u201cBeyond the Unholy Grave\u201d and \u201cLand of No Return\u201d are also great songs (especially the first one), they should be here as well! So, in case your version of \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d also doesn\u2019t have these tracks, you just have to buy yourself one more version (CD or LP), which includes the entire tracklist. \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d was reissued on vinyl in 2016 and this new remastered version has the complete album.\n\nStandout tracks: \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d, \u201cMutilation\u201d, \u201cEvil Dead\u201d, \u201cRegurgitated Guts\u201d, \u201cSacrificial\u201d\nFinal rate: 90/100\n",
        "\nMany things after Spiritual Healing was released happened. Chuck Schuldiner lost his lineup after Andrews and Butler ditched Chuck and Chuck took legal actions and fired those two. James Murphy went on to Obituary and other bands. Chuck Schuldiner decided to intend on hire temporary members (session member members mostly). Chuck this time recruited his longtime friend Steve DiGiorgio and Cynic's guitarist and drummer Paul Masvidal and Sean Reifert. This album is obviously the album most famous for being the album Death goes from an amazing death metal band to the apex of Death metal.\n\nThe production on this album like Spiritual Healing is tailored for their respective album perfect. It makes the album feel nature for listeners. It also allows all parts of the music to shine (which will be spoken about later on)\n\nThe lyrics of the album are like Spiritual Healing in the sense of it criticizing something, but it more general and mature. It is more general because it is like an X in a Math an equation, you can insert to more situations than the last. If you think about it people you interact with in life you can cite someone who wears a secret face or someone who is the sad person whose only pleasure is to be a jerk. You can relate to \"Secret Face\" and \"Lack of Comprehension.\" This album is the first in Death's discography in which they make songs relatable to almost all people on earth and all times making this album philosophical. It is mature because it thinks out of the box. In songs like \"See Through Dreams,you\" Chuck explores the idea of about a person that's born blind, yet is able to associate images with the sounds and his thoughts in his dreams. No one in the Death metal at the time had put so much thought into their lyrics. The lyrics also succeeded because it is vivid and you the lyrics can give an image your brain.\n\nChuck's vocal are great in a few words. Chuck's vocals in this album are matured. Chuck serves as the narrator of the what is happening in the lyrics and is still hard hitting. In \"Lack of Comprehension\" Chuck describe the person and shreds him to pieces showing people's reception of him. The listener can see the pain of the person in \"Suicide Machine\" because Chuck perfectly shows in his voice. On this album, Chuck's voice fits The vocals on this album on this album are easy to understand so you have no excuse to not listen to this album.\n\nThe bass and drums on this album are good. Steve DiGiorgio on this album accompany the guitar well and don't ruin the album, but serves it well. It shines on \"Lack of Comprehension\" in the beautiful intro and shows the band's progression and ability to . Sean Reifert is energetic like the drummer on the last album but takes it up a level. It is better technically speaking and more jazz-influenced, which shows his creativity. \n\nThe guitars on this album are phenomenal. The riffs fit the mood and pace. On songs like \"Suicide Machine,\" the riff tells you that the song is dark and ominous. It gives you a preview of the song. The soloing on this album shred and are memorable. The solo on \"Lack of Comprehension\" shows the albums emotion and is memorable. It is more refined than, most death metal albums at the time. This album in the soloing department is still technical but is more cohesive. It is less about showing off on this album and more about the musician. On \"Cosmic Sea\" both guitarists gives great musicianship and it gives more pleasure. The accuracy and creativity blow my mind. The soloing is melodic, technical, and beautiful, which is what this album did.\n\nRecommended tracks\nFlattening of Emotions\nSuicide Machine \nLack of Comprehension \nCosmic Sea\nSecret Face\n",
        "\nDeath's first three albums were more or less pretty standard death metal albums that were nonetheless extremely influential to the scene. Human furthers Death's sound into a more cerebral and intellectually conscious form of death metal that would become known as technical death metal. While the progression of the band's technical skills had yet to reach its apex at this point, there is still some obvious change in sound.\n\nThe opener, \"Flattening of Emotions\" is an awesome introduction to Human, and it definitely fulfills the expectations set by Death's previous albums with it's crushing, yet catchy sound. The riffing has become noticeably cleaner and more defined, with more technical prowess being demonstrated. This is the case for all instruments- the lead guitar is cleaner and more discernible, and the rhythm section has become much tighter. \n\nHuman is the first Death album where a significant change in Schuldiner's haunting style of vocal delivery becomes noticeable. The vocals are more comprehensible; it is quite easy for a listener with little experience with hearing death metal vocals to make out the words, and he now growls in a slightly higher register reminiscent of the vocals on Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness. His vocals actually sound somewhat sickly, which is a good thing as it creates a more morbid sound.\n\nThe lyrics on Human are possibly the album's best attribute. Chuck writes of themes such as politics, philosophy, and suicide. He experimented with this on the previous release, Spiritual Healing, but this fully absorbed itself into Human. The themes of gore have been mostly expunged from the music at this point, but there still are some subtle instances of morbid references.\n\nOne of the greatest things about Human is the fact that it is a technical and progressive album, however, this does not take over the music completely. Bands such as Dream Theater tend to write songs purely for the purpose of showing off their musical and technical skills, paying no attention to what kind of atmosphere is produced by the final outcome. This problem that plagues a lot of progressive metal and technical death metal bands results in annoying music with awkward transitions between sections. Death wrote these songs with the actual structure in mind; it seems like the technical sound came naturally, so this issue is entirely avoided.\n\nI will conclude my review by saying that Human is one of the greatest death metal records out there- any extreme metal fan who does not own it should definitely look in to buying it.\n",
        "\nDeath's Scream Bloody Gore is a very important point in the history of heavy metal. It is the first major death metal album. Yes, I know that Possessed released Seven Churches two years prior, but that album is the blueprint of death metal. This was the album that turned death metal into a relevant genre like thrash metal or black metal. I could spout the litany about how much influence this album has had within various metal circles for the length of an entire review, but I'm going to move on and talk about the music itself now.\n\nThe album's opener, \"Infernal Death\", separates death metal from its thrash roots with its slow tempos. The slower sound sets a very dark, macabre mood, bringing to mind images of acts such as murder and torture. The tempos found on this album range from slow, doom like plodding to thrash shredding. The riffs on this album are great. There are a few riffs that serve the role of making the songs longer, but most of the riffs here really kick ass. The clanging intros to \"Mutilation\" and \"Scream Bloody Gore\" sound very similar to each other, and are both some of the highest points on the album. Scream Bloody Gore lacks great soloing- most of the solos are very fast, incomprehensible bits of shredding, but they do work well with the music.\n\nThe lyrics on Scream Bloody Gore are encompassed by the title- most of the songs describe torture, strange and morbid varieties of sex, death, and Satanic themes. The Occult lyrics help add some variety to the album, so it isn't just a straight gorefest all the way like albums by bands like Cannibal Corpse tend to be. I'm tempted to give some examples of the descriptive imagery in the lyrics, but I'd prefer not to spoil it; I think the lyrics have the most impact on the listener when they are exposed to them for the first time through the music. \n\nThis album boasts some of death metal's best production. The sound is incredibly heavy and dark. Unfortunately, I own the remaster, so I can only speak for that, but I am sure the original mastering is even better. No one instrument seems to take center stage here- they are all very balanced in the mix. The music sounds sufficiently raw, but everything manages to be audible through all of the noise.\n\nAs much as I'd love to list the standouts, there are simply too many, and that defeats the purpose of listing them in the first place. I will say that the title track is an excellent embodiment of what this album is, and anyone who wants an idea of what to expect before buying the album should look that one up on YouTube.\n\nScream Bloody Gore is truly an important point in the evolution of metal, and it has a sound that backs up its reputation. If you are looking to get into death metal, but don't know where to start, I'd certainly suggest this as a starting point.\n",
        "\nYou know those riffs you hear for the first time and for the rest of your life you always remember the first time you heard them? Such a phenomenon might bring up visions of the intro to \"Raining Blood\" by Slayer or the machine gun ending to \"One\" by Metallica. For me, I will always remember the first time I heard the riff that kicks in 45 seconds into the title track, \"Symbolic\". It is very unexpected and contrasts greatly with that of the slow guitar introduction to 50 mammoth minutes of progressive death metal perfection. Following this riff is a song interspersed with slow sections, fast sections, guitar solos, and the voice of the almighty Chuck Schuldiner. I find it impossible to come up with one complaint about the opener to the album. The way Chuck weaves together slow, Black Sabbath-inspired passages with chaotic guitar riffs, palm-muted interludes, and dual guitar solos shows that the band's maturity and musicianship has reached a new epoch in not only metal music but music as a whole. Then, when you're done gawking at the first song on the album, \"Zero Tolerance\" kicks in with some of the heaviest riffing I've heard by Death. This song really reminds me of a previous Death song, \"Together as One\", which is the third track off of Human.\n\nThe mid-section of the album is just as equally as impressive as the first two songs. \"Sacred Serenity\" starts off with Kelly Conlon playing an unforgettable bass intro similar to that of a much more progressive version of \"Sadistic Magician\" by Municipal Waste. Chuck soon follows suit playing the same riff in a much higher key on guitar. This really sets up the song as one of the more abrasive songs on the album with the bass striking from the background, assaulting your speakers at every corner. \"Without Judgement\" is by far one of the most unique songs on the album with the song building up to two palm-muted guitar interludes through the use of marching-like minor key buildups guaranteed to excite even the most dreary metalheads.\n\nStarting the finale to the album is \"Misanthrope\", which wastes no time getting started. Through it's use of differing verses, tempo changes, and changing drum beats, \"Misanthrope\" perfectly sets up the start of the epic finale to the album, \"Perennial Quest\". This song is the perfect ending to this monumental album showcasing Chuck's ability to craft extremely interesting songs. With different twists at every corner, this song feels like a literal quest to finish the album. Doom progressions are swiftly met with purely evil riffs, which in turn are met with incredible solos by Chuck. To end the album, an acoustic ballad is performed as an ode to finishing the quest. This part reminds me of \"Fade to Black\" by Metallica and is foreshadowing of a certain acoustic song on Death's last album. \n\nIt should be noted that the transition from Death's earlier, purely death metal material to a mix of progressive and death metal is fully completed with this album. The amount Chuck matured musically in just 8 years is purely inspiring. Every track on this album sounds different and is to this day one of the most diverse records I've ever heard. If you put Biomech by Ocean Machine, Crack the Skye by Mastodon, and Ride the Lightning by Metallica into a blender, the finished product would be Symbolic. Not only musically, but lyrically the evolution of the band is clearly evident. Gone are the gory lyrics of yesteryear instead exchanged for macabre views of several aspects of society. My personal favorite are the lyrics of \"Symbolic\" in which Chuck compares recalling nostalgic memories to the high of a drug:\n\n\"I close my eyes\nAnd sink within myself\nRelive the gift of precious memories\nIn need of a fix called innocence\"\n\nTL;DR: If death metal were a mountain, this album would be the summit. Symbolic is an album measured by the strength of its incredibly diverse track list, unforgettable verses, brilliant progressions, and the mark of Chuck Schuldiner's pure genius. This album stands out not only as one of the greatest death metal records of all time, but as one of the best records ever created. \n\nOriginally written for qjukebox.com\n",
        "\nIt goes without saying that one's judgement upon Death's records can become clouded and biased by the unbelievable impact the band has had on the metal community. Therefore, I will (attempt) to eliminate some of that bias in my review.\n\nThe first song of the album greets you with the bloodcurdling scream of Chuck Schuldiner: \"DIE! DIE! DIE!\". This then fades into a great death metal song, \"Infernal Death\", about piles of corpses being burned. I really like how the bass is mixed alongside the guitar. It has a very thick tone and adds a certain layer of heaviness that is mostly lost in today's metal scene. For a 1987 debut album, I would argue this album sounds very close to perfect in terms of production. All instruments are clearly audible and the atmosphere is very reminiscent of the cover art, as if I were in the same medieval chamber the one-eyed skeleton administered the zombie ritual. However, as the album progresses, my interest slightly begins to wane. There are some parts that catch my attention like the eerie, funeral sounding progression that kicks off \"Evil Dead\" and the terrifying chorus of \"Scream Bloody Gore\". That being said, the main problem I have with this album is the very structured, similar sounding mid-section of tracks, with the exception of \"Baptized In Blood\", the latter being one of the strongest tracks on the album. Songs such as \"Sacrificial\", \"Mutilation\", and \"Torn to Pieces\" are very generic sounding metal songs that I would almost struggle to classify as death metal. Unfortunately, having been spoiled by Death's entire discography, I found myself bored with these songs and waiting for some tempo changes or progressive verses leading into a blistering riff.\n\nThe major strengths of this album come from the first two songs and the last two songs. \"Evil Dead\" is foreshadowing of what will come in later Death albums with many different riffs, an incredible solo, and the previously mentioned intro. However, the undeniable force behind the success of this album is Chuck's vocals. I struggle to find words to describe the raw emotion and power behind his voice. The vocals sound dry, like he desperately needs a drink of water, but this is the best sound for this album. He sounds like he is in pure pain throughout the entire record and only adds to Scream Bloody Gore's authenticity as one of the most evil albums in existence. Just give a listen to the title track where Chuck's vocal prowess is shown off in all of it's glory. When the chorus kicks in, I can't help but get shivers down my entire body as Chuck quite literally screams bloody gore.\n\nThe album title very much lives up to it's name. Lyrically, the album is \"chuck\"-full of extremely gory lyrics. Take the intro verse to the title track for example:\n\n\"Decapitated head licking your cunt\nSucking all the blood from your stump\nIntestinal guts taking their hold\nLeaving you dead, stiff and cold\"\n\nThis verse itself is very reminiscent of the rest of the album. The lyrics are one reason I believe this album is cemented in death metal history as it would be ignorant to deny bands such as Cannibal Corpse and Dying Fetus haven't directly drawn from this creative well.\n\nMy favorite song from this album: \"Scream Bloody Gore\"\n\nTL;DR: One of the most iconic debuts in the history of metal kicks off the legacy of Death as we know it. Filled with gory lyrics, blistering instrumentation, and the undeniable presence of Chuck Schuldiner, Scream Bloody Gore is as classic as death metal gets.\n",
        "\nDuring the late 1990s, Death's frontman Chuck Schuldiner was focusing deeply on making sure that his idea of being in a progressive/power metal band would become a reality (this band would be called Control Denied). This was going along rather swimmingly for him. However, the fans were craving another release by Death (and for obvious reasons). Chuck took kindly to this idea and got to work on one more album for them before they went on hiatus. He didn't really have to do a whole lot of extra work, either. Some of the songs on this album were meant to be on the debut album from Control Denied, so he \"Deatheized\" them. Then he gathered Richard Christy on the drums, Scott Clendenin on the bass and Shannon Hamm on the other guitar. This is the lineup that recorded the last album under Death's name, \"The Sound Of Perseverance\".\n\nWhile not being the best album that Death released, it manages to be extraordinarily high up on the food chain (or in this case, the metal chain) and it hasn't been forgotten by anybody. This is probably Death's most melodic release to date while still managing to have a good amount of energy. It is still raw power, just raw power with a shitload of complexity and some melody as well. It fits splendidly well in the end. Actually, It is a bit more on melodic during the first half of the album and it gets more abrasive towards the end. This trait doesn't exactly apply to every track of the album. The first track, \"Scavenger Of Human Sorrow\" was actually one of the most abrasive songs on the album. This really starts on track 2, \"Bite The Pain\". The eighth track, \"A Moment Of Clarity\" was the most abrasive song on the album. I remember when I heard the opening riff on that song and it just made me think \"Well THIS could solve my problems with waking up in the morning\". Sure, it's one of the slower songs but that doesn't mean that it's a wimpy track. Then there's the final track, \"Painkiller\" (originally by Judas Priest), which is less aggressive, but I can't get mad at that song. But the one problem with it is the solos. They're good, but not nearly as nicely done as the original and they're actually not even the same solos. The other thing about this song that I want to mention is the fact that this is the first song where Chuck used clean vocals. He only did it for about 30 seconds overall, but it was nice to hear him experiment because that's what he's generally good at.\n\nMy highlights on the album include \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", with extremely relatable lyrics and some masterful guitar work. It's one of the heaviest songs on the album. Not quite as heavy as the early days, but this isn't really a death metal album. Another is \"Spirit Crusher\", which is one of the most varied songs on the record. It contains a shitload of tempo-changes, however somehow, it is able to prevent itself from feeling like a scattered mess like that of a bum in someone else's basement. It contains some excellent riffage and it has some very metaphorical lyrics that fit the song. Another highlight is track 5, \"Flesh and the Power It Holds\", where the level of technicality on the album is at one of its absolute highest points. Lyrics are top notch as well. The opening riff is a bit odd. But it's strangely appropriate. The last two tracks that I wish to mention are \"To Forgive Is to Suffer\" with a very clean song structure and lyrics that touch on a subject that I haven't heard anyone else in music explore and I've been listening to music for a long time: being too nice to people who are flat out douchebags. If you keep act like their actions are not in some way doing harm to anyone or anything, they will continue to do it and ruin happiness. The last track is the cover of \"Painkiller\". Like I've said before, it may not be quite as good as the original version by Judas Priest, but it still stands out with the rest of the highlights on this album (I am not saying that it is the best song on the album).\n\nMy Favorite song on the album is \"Voice Of The Soul\". I'm not entirely sure how to generally classify it, but I know that it is a masterpiece. It blends progressive rock, Spanish folk and ambient music to make a dark, as well as eerily soothing sound. It has four sections of music and each one catches your ear, especially the second one. The acoustic melody has a very (for lack of better word) flowing sound and the lead has this as well, but with a more technical and sophisticated sound. No drums, no bass, no vocals, just guitar. It is actually a ballad, which works splendidly. Probably the best song that Death has ever forged.\n\nPractically every aspect of this album is sufficient, but my favorite out of it all is the guitar work. Chuck and Shannon give riffs and solos that are almost as powerful as they are technical. You can tell that they both knew what they were doing when they went into the studio to record this album. It manages to run strong throughout the album and never at any point weaken. Everything else is good About this album as well. There is only one tiny problem: Chuck's voice is not nearly as charismatic as it was on the last album. Come to think of it, it can actually get kind of annoying. This luckily doesn't get in the way too much at all.\n\nThis is some of the best work that Death has ever released (The best being \"Symbolic\"). It isn't one of those albums that you forget about, musically. You can't remember everything it contains, but that's practically impossible. It is an album where you can marvel and greatly appreciate due to the immensely sufficient and sophisticated technicality that is heard on it. This is an album that I greatly recommend to fans of progressive metal, thrash metal and anyone who isn't too close-minded to not get past the guttural vocals. I for one love it a lot. R.I.P. Chuck Schuldiner:\n",
        "\nIn the 1980s, Death was a band that was making music that was more extreme and brutal than anything else coming out of its own country. Their demos earned them a contract with Combat Records. This lead to the release of their debut album, \"Scream Bloody Gore\" in 1987. In the following year, they returned to the studio to record this album. When you listen to this, you can immediately tell that the writing style of Chuck Schuldiner has improved greatly. This time around, the music is more focused. It's a less simplistic album and it has more maturity and variety. However, the album still manages to maintain the raw power and aggression that the band already had, which is important. You can't be a death metal band and not be heavy and aggressive. It just doesn't work that way. When it tries to, you get those shitty bands like Suicide Silence and Asking Alexandria. I don't think that we need too much of that. One thing that this album is famous for is that it was the first of the Florida death metal album and the very first album overall to be produced by the legendary Scott Burns. He was a very skilled producer and for this reason, this here is the album that brought in other bands of the genre. It can be quite difficult to contain fast double-bass in an album and still have it sound good, let alone audible.\n\nNow for the music on the album:\n\nThe album's title track was a track that is often praised by fans. I can't say that I get it. Sure, it is very good, but it seems a little overrated to me. It can be a little boring solo-wise and it doesn't really have a whole lot of charisma in the intro. It has grown on me over time, but I still do not find it to be quite as enjoyable as everyone continuously makes it out to be. However, I do love the following track, \"Born Dead\". It's one of the slower songs on the album and it has a chorus that actually sound a little on the groovy side. \"Left To Die\" was a song that has a bit of a darker atmosphere and it's actually pretty well-written. It's one of the more technical songs on the album and it has a really awesome solo. It's not quite technical death metal (like their later releases), but it's pretty focused for what it is. The riffs in the song are great as well. Then, there is my favorite song on the album: the roller coaster of a track, \"Pull The Plug\". This is a track that has some truly awesome riffage and a powerful vocal performance, one of the best that Chuck has ever performed. I had shivers run down my spine.\n\nThe scream of the word, \"late\" just flat out throttled me. I shoved myself back in my chair. \"Open Casket\" is a cool song. The truth is that there is not anything too special about it, but I find it rather amusing that whenever they would play it live, Chuck would introduce the song by saying this: \"This next song is dedicated to those who don't believe in death metal\". The song itself has nothing to do with anything like that, but it's still pretty amusing. The last song that I will mention is the last song on the album, \"Choke On It\". It is pretty much the only track on this album which I did not enjoy all that much. It's generic and the lyrics are pretty fucking stupid. It's not a horrible song, it's just not very good.\n\nOne thing that people tend to not realize about this album is that the lyrics have matured. They're still tongue-in-cheek and horror-themed, but the truth is that they aren't quite as gory. Rather than focusing on a zombie risen from the grave with vomit for a mind and maggots for a cock that is out to kill you, they deal with things that can actually happen. \"Pull The Plug\" is about being on life support and then being sent into depression by it. \"Open Casket\" is about how brief life really is. Sure, there are still those lyrics that are on the brutal side, such as \"Leprosy\" which deals with the disease and then \"Choke On It\" with lyrics about being tortured, followed by swallowing your own tongue, but hey, there are events such as this that have actually occurred or could occur.\n\nThis album is quite a target for fans of death metal and I can clearly see why that is. There are so many people that consider it to be the absolute most exceptional album, in its genre. I personally think of it as second (under Death's \"Spiritual Healing\" and I'm not including technical death metal or other offsprings of the genre), but as I have said in other reviews, I am just one man with one opinion. This is something that I will give to this album: If someone who has not ever heard death metal wants to hear some of it, then the very first thing that I would recommend to him/her is Death's \"Leprosy\".\n",
        "\nThe Sound of Perseverance is a masterpiece that deserves all of the praise in the world. Not only is this Chuck Schuldiner's unsurpassed work, it also combines all of the distinct and important elements from Death's previous and near perfect albums such as Human, Individual Thought Patterns and Symbolic. The chaotic and improvised drum fill by Richard Christy that kicks off the opening track \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" is a preview of the musical talent, impressiveness, originality and diversity that is to come later in the album. Every track seems to feed off the other's energy and ferocity in an effortless manner. The anger and bitterness felt on the third track \"Spirit Crusher\" depicts a sense of betrayal and vengeance in Chuck's lyrics and shrieking vocals. Definitely one of the pinnacle tracks of the album, the somber and insanely catchy bass line along with the tasteful and complex drum fills make \"Spirit Crusher\" an instant classic. \n\nAs the album progresses, a casual listener is able to witness how Chuck Schuldiner's musicianship, songwriting and guitar solos have reached the peak of his outstanding musical career. Furthermore, Chuck did not only use the musical elements that made Human, Individual Thought Patterns and Symbolic so great, he was able to expand on the raw energy and melody on those albums to make Death's most accomplished and diverse work to date. The album also features \"Voice of the Soul\" an absolutely gorgeous yet sorrowful instrumentation that showcases the perfect balance between two harmonizing guitar solo and an acoustic ballad. The musicianship was so exquisite on \"The Sound of Perseverance\" that Chuck recruited rhythm guitarist Shannon Hamm and drummer Richard Christy to perform on his more melodic side project Control Denied. In the case of Death's later albums like Human, Individual Though Patterns and Symbolic, this was definitely a breakthrough album for Shannon Hamm, Scott Clendenin and Richard Christy whom became more renowned musicians in the metal community afterwards. \n\nWhile there are many spectacular moments on \"The Sound of Perseverance\", the lengthy duel of solos on \"A Moment of Clarity\" between Schuldiner and Hamm demonstrate another instance where Chuck is able to showcase both his and Shannon Hamm's guitar soloing skills. There have been numerous moments on Death albums where the rhythm guitarist shares the spotlight with Chuck, such as Rick Rozz, Paul Masvidal, Andy LaRocque and Bobby Koelble. The finale of this masterpiece is an excellent cover of Judas Priest's \"Painkiller\" and is a tribute that the metal legends would definitely be proud of. With Chuck being a huge fan of Judas Priest, one can hear the unquestionable passion while he is shrieking the verses: \"This is the painkiller!\" Chuck's vocals have also significantly evolved since his earlier work and have become a lot more higher pitched but at the same time, they fit in perfectly with the sound. \n\nAs a whole, Death are an outstanding and legendary band whose legacy is unparalleled in the metal community. They released many excellent and highly memorable albums throughout their existence. The Sound of Perseverance is the ideal metal masterpiece and the perfect way to seal Chuck's legacy, one can only wonder which musical directions Chuck would have gone if he were still with us today. As an outstanding musician and human being who gave metalheads a masterpiece that will be remembered for many years to come.\n",
        "\nGoddamn this album sucks! The last in line of Death's 'intelligent, progressive and technical' latter era (think progressive wankery with the occasional riff and an outer coating of 'death metal influences'), it represents the nadir of the band and any major death metal act (barring Illud Divinum Insanus or Promise). Never have I heard such a degenerate and irritating piece of shit from such a notable and influential band, and gladly never again, because no one was dumb enough to emulate what the fuck goes on during this album. Literally every facet of it is absolute garbage - whether it be confused, wanking or annoying garbage, all shit smells the same when it is in a massive goddamn heap.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get the most obvious thing out of the way - the production is pretty godawful. Normally a thin guitar tone isn't bad in my books; it makes the riffs sharper as far as I am concerned. Here though, they sound... screechy and powerless. When they play anything at all it doesn't sound good or right. Several melodies throughout this album almost seem out of tune because of them, and thus the album becomes very unappealing to listen to. The drums are surprisingly thin and hollow, particularly the metallic snare. In fact, the whole album sounds very 'empty' and hollow on the whole, lacking any sort of sonic punch at all. On the whole, this is a pretty poor production job, but credit where credit is due - the pronounced bass guitar and thundering double bass are a massive plus.\n\nWhen it comes to technical performance, things are a bit mixed. Chuck's riffs are completely unmemorable and on the whole just kind of suck. They are neither melodic nor aggressive, they aren't particularly technically accomplished either. I don't care how progressive or technical everything else appears to be, metal is all about the riffs, and these are just filler riffs. They sound like they are straddling a line between the progressive power metal of Chuck's future project Control Denied and the 'death metal' of the previous 3 albums, albeit in a really confused and forced fashion. It sounds like Chuck wants nothing to do with Death or death metal at all, but is being aggressive for the sake of it. It is completely contrived and shite, and someone like Chuck could have done better. By contrast, Richard Christy's drumming and Scott Clendenin's bass is technically very impressive. This album is full of excellent, reflective bass breaks and drumming that tinkers with odd patterns and shows a strong sense of variation.\n\nAnd now, we come to this album's main fucking flaw. Chuck... seriously... just SHUT THE FUCK UP!. If he couldn't growl with some fucking BALLS, WHY did he do it at all? His 'death growls' are some of the most bitchy, cat-like versions of the vocal style I have ever heard. As autothrall said, they sound 'like a little girl'. Ooh, just what I always wanted, a grown man screaming like a little girl on a 'death metal' album! They flip-flop between being utterly comical during some of the higher pitched moments, are irritating the rest of the time, and in one instance just make me sad (you know which song I am talking about...). They are not aggressive at all, they aren't threatening, and they have nothing going for them as a vocal style. This also furthers my point of this album straddling the divide between Control Denied and older Death - they are dirtied high pitched power/prog vocals, attempting to maintain a fa\u00e7ade of aggression while also trying to fulfill the role of strong power metal vocals. IT DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.\n\nHowever, as I have stated before, technicality is all for naught when it all coalesces into a goddamn MESS. Nothing in these songs fit together right at all, and are on the whole very awkward to listen to. One needn't look further than the first track to find these flaws. Nothing flows at all; the songs are rhythmically disjointed where even the riffs don't flow into one another. The song just drops away to leave one of the excellent, though completely random and misplaced, bass break. The drums actually don't help at all. While they are highly interesting on their own, they don't fit into the songs either, as they never actually keep a beat. They are just machine-gunned all over the songs, with no regard for timing or structure, and throw the songs off kilter. Technicality is great, especially in the drums, but if the goddamn drummer can't keep a steady beat or keep time, what is the point? A drum machine would have done a better job than this guy.\n\nNeedless to say therefore, the songwriting is pretty bad. The songs suffer from having too many ideas in too short a space of time, and thus come across as fragmented, as each individual section never has time to get going or really develop, before another unrelated idea comes stomping all over it. Oh, and this album is mired in its wankery. Whether it be the squeaky, shite solos or the drumming, this album noodles even more than any of its predecessors, i.e: it noodles way too much. These songs technically progress, but in such a juddering and haphazard fashion that they don't really feel as though they go anywhere at all.\n\nSuffice to say, 'Voice of the Soul' is the only good thing about this album, as it has no vocals. It lacks the rhythmic retardation that the rest of this album suffers from, as well as the incessant wankery. However, due to its late position in the album, it does little to nurse the enormous sonic wound this album leaves, even if the effort is appreciated. A comforting respite from the horrific slaughter of all things musical, if you will. Well, that is the best track... how about the worst? You saw it coming... Chuck. Leave my fucking favourite bands ALONE. The Judas Priest cover tacked on the end of this thing doesn't really do anything to the original, apart from butcher the opening with some terrible sweep picking, neuter the song with the shite production, and then sodomise it with Chuck's kitten screams and the sloppy, wanking soloing that replaces the Tipton/Downing melodic glory of old. This is the song that depresses me with the vocals by the way, in case you couldn't work that one out.\n\nSo, uh yeah. This apparently is a masterpiece, highly rated by the mainstream. This juddering, screechy, overly noodling and pretentious pile of dog shit is some sort of masterpiece of this band and all of metal. That is more of a mainstream perception, and this tends to divide opinions a bit more here. Maybe I am missing something, but I can't see how anyone can like this at all. It didn't influence anything good, it isn't good on its own terms, it isn't even good by the standards of the band. Those that do like this aren't wrong, but this agrees with me about as much as some ipecac syrup agrees with me - i.e: it just doesn't. AT ALL.\n\nNow, time to be serious for a moment. I don't hate Chuck Schuldiner, or Death. I know how vastly influential the band are on the genre. Scream Bloody Gore is one of my favourite albums of all time. Chuck was an inimitable figure in metal, and I respect him endlessly for his early contributions to death metal. His early work was amazing, not his Human and on stuff. Let us all remember him for his zombie rituals, not the loosely cobbled together, aborted messes that are the 'intelligent' Death.\n\nR.I.P. Chuck Schuldiner (13th May 1967 - 13th December 2001)\nR.I.P. Scott Clendenin (17th January 1968 - 24th March 2015)\n",
        "\nI've listened to this album numerous times, and have, every single time, derived a delightful amount of pleasure from it. I do not tire of it, which, for an album that invests so heavily in composition, is a quality that is not easily achieved. Everything fits perfectly: the drumming, Chuck's vocals, and those delightful guitar passages. Here's a death metal album one can whistle to. It also gets better the more one listens to it, instead of becoming predictable and tiring. It took a while to fully appreciate this album; the first listening was promising and interesting, but not infatuation-inducing. After a while, though, it seemed the mass of cells under my scalp finally got the gist of it, and have been bleeding endorphins out of their tiny ears every time I listen to it. The guitar compositions are, personally, this album's most endearing quality. Moderately technical, melodic, and creative, they show a combination of musicianship and elegance that can hardly be surpassed by any other death metal album.\n\nI suppose the album could be said to contain progressive elements, especially considering the year of its production. Some songs contain well-placed quiet or mellow passages that precede a thoroughly satisfying riff. \"Empty Words\" is a excellent example thereof. A few acoustic guitar passages are scattered about too-exactly like icing on cake. The lyrics deal with subjects ranging from intellectual musings, to dystopian prophesies of surveillance states (1000 Eyes), and enigmatic and (highly speculative here) seemingly personal struggles (Crystal Mountain). It is a fresh change from the themes of blood, gore, atrocities, madness, horrors and terrors so fashionable in death metal. Chuck's vocal execution has drawn criticism from some, something I am yet to understand. The vocals are clear, audible, and do not awkwardly force themselves onto the lyrics, like death metal growls have been known to do. Far from it: they are natural, very emotionally charged, and fit perfectly with the rest of the instruments (so to speak).\n\nIt would be difficult to pick out favorites in this album, simply because every single track is a gem. However, if I had a gun to my head, I would pick \"Empty Words\", \"Crystal Mountain\", and \"1000 Eyes\". I can't find faults in this album, or anything I would want modified. It's perfect, a thing of genius.\n",
        "\nThe first time I listened to Death's sixth album--like, really sat down and listened to it--I knew almost immediately that I would love it. It wasn't one of those quick love affairs, where you get super excited about the album right away but it wears out quickly. No, in the case of Symbolic, I liked it at first, but I could tell that it would only get better with subsequent listens; there was just so much going on, and I knew that there was a lot more waiting to be unearthed the next few times I dove in. But that the album was able to tell me that AND got me to fall in love with it on first listen is in itself an incredible feat. Sometimes it might be one or the other, but almost never BOTH at the same time!\n\nOn Symbolic, Chuck Schuldiner's progressive songwriting reached a perfect intersection with his technical ability. It's a hard-to-reach point, but when that balance was found, it's almost like he couldn't stop cranking out awesome music if he tried. And for nine songs, drummer Gene Hoglan, guitarist Bobby Koelble, and bassist Kelly Conlon all kept in perfect stride with Chuck's genius. Before this album, the band was almost at that point, but it felt like Schuldiner was still trying to figure out how to make his songs flow better; meanwhile, on The Sound of Perseverance, which came after Symbolic, the progressive and technical elements (in my opinion) were stretched out a bit too much to the point where they superseded songwriting. But on Symbolic, technicality and songwriting simultaneously meet together at a glorious summit, meshing together like yin and yang. \n\nTwo other elements on this album that mesh fantastically are Death's own unique sound and the sound of their influences. The band roars out at the listener in a new style all their own, but at the same time they don't forget their roots. Conlon's basslines in songs like \"Sacred Serenity\" harken back to Steve Harris' in Iron Maiden, while guitar solos leap and dance as wildly and gracefully as Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing did in Judas Priest. At the same time, the band doesn't leave out its more extreme influences, throwing in thrashy tremolo-picked riffs reminiscent of Slayer and Kreator into every track. But Symbolic is neither a thrash nor NWOBHM worship album; it's Death being freaking DEATH. They mix their influences, either blending them or segregating them whenever it is most benefiting to do so. And Chuck/Death injects every song with the signature grit and rawness that he innovated so brilliantly, resulting in an album that is 100% influences and 100% Death.\n\nWhat's so impressive about Death's blending of sounds on this album is how they can change tempo, tone, and mood on a dime, seamlessly, without ever interrupting the song's flow. \"Crystal Mountain,\" one of Death\u2019s best and most popular songs, bursts out of the gates immediately at the song's beginning with a pounding riff and matching drumbeat; but this only lasts for a few measures before the band switches to a softer passage, with haunting clean guitar and dreamy atmosphere. Completely different, and yet equally fun to listen to and still fitting to the song. Death continues to dance back and forth between these styles effortlessly in just that one song--not to mention the rest of the album. The heavy parts are groovy, wild, dynamic, you name it; and the softer parts, on top of creating atmosphere, provide stark contrast that accentuates the heaviness to come. \n\nLead guitar on Symbolic is especially unique. The role of the lead guitar is taken beyond that of solos and expanded into breaks, counterpoints, and melodies. In \u201cZero Tolerance,\u201d Chuck\u2019s vocals trade off with leads that accentuate the song\u2019s atmosphere. Soon afterward, the song plunges into a long instrumental section featuring Schuldiner and Koelble dueling fiercely. Throughout the entire album, little moments pop up here and there where the lead guitar pokes in, as if through a metaphorical door in the back of the metaphorical room, and drops a beautiful passage that, while sometimes complex, never devolves into mindless technical noodling. And of course the actual solos are incredible too. Sometimes the song leads up to the solo and explodes in climax; sometimes the solo suddenly leaps out of nowhere. Either way, the solo always takes the listener on a wild adventure, each one standing out in its own uniqueness. \n\nHave I worshiped this album enough yet? No? Excellent. One last thing--Chuck\u2019s voice. Wow. It\u2019s commonly discussed how much his band\u2019s sound changed over the course of seven albums, but not as much discussed is how his vocals changed with them. Symbolic-era Chuck molded his Cookie Monster death growl from earlier days into something that was more human--halfway between a scream and a shout. There\u2019s really no way to put it into words, you just have to listen to it. But it sounds more human, more real. It kind of fits the music and themes, too. Earlier Death was obsessed with typical death-metal horror-movie imagery; later on they moved to more contemplative topics--the general theme of Symbolic is achieving inner peace. It\u2019s a bit more grounded in reality, and Chuck\u2019s vocals sound a bit more real and human here. Of course, on The Sound of Perseverance, he\u2019d take his vocals to the opposite banshee-like extreme; but here, just like everything else, the vocals work perfectly with every other facet of the music. \n\nWell, I think I\u2019ve just about gushed on this album as much as I possibly can at this point. There\u2019s not a whole lot left to say besides that Symbolic retains a firm spot in my top five albums of all time. Probably somewhere around third or fourth place; I don\u2019t think this unseats Master of Puppets or Rust In Peace, and it contends heavily with Reign In Blood, but it is still more than worthy of being in that kind of company. Every riff, lead break, solo, drum fill, and vocal performance is absolutely killer. No other album has as unique a blend of brutality, technicality, precision, emotion, and beauty as Symbolic by Death. While Chuck won\u2019t ever grace us with another work like this, it\u2019s still a worthy testament to his greatness and should stand tall as a classic for a long, long time.\n",
        "\nThere is absolutely no need to go into the full background of a band with such deity-like status as Death. Anyone who's anyone in the extreme music swamplands are quite aware of the amount of influence Mr Schuldiner had on thrash, death and progressive metal, so that can of course be skipped as that is not why we're here. For you see (and remember), before Florida and New York turned the metal scene into a bloodbath, there was this; the quintessential pinnacle of death metal fury. It all had to start somewhere, after all, and many have pointed to this being the one fulcrum unto which thrash would be perverted into something far less wholesome. So they say, anyway...as for me, I feel the general public is on to something, and yet...\n\nOn the one hand, there's no discounting the amount of profound energy in the music and performance. This is an album made by a band that really had something to prove, a group who saw fit to take metal from the merely violent into the sickeningly grotesque, where imagery, riffing and thematics pushed as many envelopes as possible. At the time there wasn't much like it, and unlike other Californian folks out there looking to turn this music into something to truly fear Chuck and co. made this ugliness work as best they could. There's no fuckin' around with tightness, post-production niceties or any sort of gloss; this is 100% musical butchery that's plenty rough and disgusting, the soundtrack to an afternoon of head shots where anything that would dare clean up the sound would take a lot of that infernal wickedness away and make it less of what it ended up being. Guitars, drums, and vomiting vocals storm the listener with a level of horror so few in the mid-to-late 80s had heard up to this point, the likes of \"Denial of Life\", \"Regurgitated Guts\" and \"Torn to Pieces\" paying more tribute than what was offered in something like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Morbid Visions\", as even their speeds alone could do little up against such direct and blunt savagery. For it's one thing to talk about killing your dumb ass and a whole other step entirely to actually go for it, and for my money Death did their best to do just that. In terms of subject matter, anyway...\n\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't exactly call this the end-all-be-all roots of death metal. It helped pave the way for the style to come to pass, no doubt about it, but it really feels like this is an album where the collective eyes are bigger than the stomach. For all the band's crafting and vision, this doesn't exactly knock it out of the park as often and as much as everyone makes it out to and as a result I question much of the overt praise it's gotten over the years. Are we seeing the forest for the trees, or are many of you/us out there simply not looking at this as subjectively as you/we should for fear or retribution from our peers? I mean, let's be real here...few tracks stand out as anything considered revolutionary, memorable or, at times, even great, and if anything this proves that the very first step in a sub-genre birth is can be shaky and slightly misfired. There are moments where \"Scream Bloody Gore\" is damned good, but even more moments where it all doesn't go anywhere and instead sounds like a thrash act too sloppy to be noticed by purveyors of the Big Four. It's not to knock Death for who they were back then, just that everyone (and genre) has to start somewhere, and has anyone ever rewritten the rules on their first try? Not that I can think of.\n\nSo all in all \"Scream Bloody Gore\" is quite good where it counts and influential to the max, but to me it's not quite the hulking beast so many claim it to be.  It thankfully avoids the stigma of being overhyped and unworthy of its glad-handing and instead can be seen and heard as that first stepping stone to a career and existence that almost knew no other. Proceed with caution...slightly.\n",
        "\nScattered throughout my next few reviews, I'm going to have a series that will be focused on old school death metal albums that I love to gush over. All reviews in this series will be 100%, I hold no shame in the amount of old school death metal albums I consider perfect. So for a capital letter at the beginning of this pathetically long review sentence: Leprosy.\n\nI'll be very honest in that I didn't like this album very much the first time I heard it, being initially exposed to the dreamy and philosophical blaring of \"Symbolic\" and \"The Sound Of Perseverance\". This album either moved too slow or too fast for me at all of the wrong times. Though time passes and minds become far less stupid, and I warmed up to this like a hot pocket in a microwave. Leprosy's doomy undertones and blistering groovy riffs made for a sickening, muddy birthing process for extreme metal's most profitable sub genre.\n\nNot only was this album influential for the thousands of greasy idiotic \"musicians\" like myself and many others, this was a production pioneer as well. Scott Burns dipped his toes into the death metal swimming pool with this album, showing his ability to make death metal sound like actual music. In fact the production of this album was so good, it convinced a healthy amount of extreme metal bands to pack up and head over to hurricane central. That is really showing of how good your production style is, when you're able to create an entire musical scene with your mixing table. Every instrument lies just in place to an audible but earthy level. And for once, you can HEAR the bass in a Morrisound recording! What a concept! Actually, the bass and guitars (both of them) lie even in the mix. The guitars charge in like knives to the flesh of an unwilling victim, while the bass sits and laughs subtly in the corner, shaking back and forth. Drumming is lead-heavy. It lies just between the guitars and bass, giving some steel beams to hold up this death metal pantheon.\n\nNow obviously I'm ignoring a bit of development in Death's macabre formula. Scream Bloody Gore was a masterpiece unto itself. But most consider it to be far too thrashy to be full on death metal. After a few listens to Leprosy, you start to understand where these people are coming from. Where \"Scream Bloody Gore\" was sickeningly brutal and particularly sticky, \"Leprosy\" brought on a whole new definition of sick and twisted to the metal dinner table. While it was surrounded by albums that were soul crushingly evil like \"Altars Of Madness\", or blunt force heavy like \"In Battle There Is No Law\", \"Leprosy\" was purely bone chilling. If Scream Bloody Gore was Night of The Living Dead, then Leprosy would have been The Exorcist. There is atmosphere dripping from every pore of this album's disfigured face. It reeks of classic horror tropes, and bleeds all of this out in it's top notch, primal riffing. Which moves us into my personal favorite part of this entire album, the riffs.\n\nChuck's riffs on SBG were fairly technical and built each song from it's foundation. The riffs on \"Leprosy\" cater to the needs of the song, they nurture and feed it like a caged beast. They are relentlessly catchy for starters. This comes from how they compliment the vocal harmonies so well. The bridge riffs of the title track just before the solo epitomizes this. Much in the way that the riffs in Kreator's \"Pleasure to Kill\" did the same thing. The riffs trickle along the ground and collect in a sludgy, messy puddle. They're very ghostly, and they move along with an almost spectral like behavior. Flowing by and surrounding your soundscape like a sickening cloud of suffocating rot. They almost make this album feel nauseating in a strangely satisfying way. From the crunchy chugs of \"Forgotten Past\", to the speed picked monstrosity of \"Born Dead\", this record makes for a variety pack of hopeless disgust. That's not even bringing up the undertones of doom metal. More specifically in the intro riffs to \"Leprosy\" and \"Pull the Plug\". They're slow and dirge-like, and give way to a dust storm of depressed euphoria. \n\nBass is quite the little bugger on this album. Chuck handles it this time around and it shows. The bass almost never deviates from the guitar-driven riff patterns. But this is another case where less is certainly more. It wisely sacrifices deviation for overall heaviness . I can't get enough of those moments like in \"Left To Die\" where you can just hear the lines being belted out of the bass to drive the groove. Songs like \"Pull The Plug\" would be absolutely barren if not for the heaviness and bluntness of the bass lines. The bass guitar is the unsung hero of \"Leprosy\". Sitting in the background and only making itself known when it knows it's needed, giving so much to the music through so little.\n\nContinuing with the less is more trope is our favorite instrument of abuse, the drums. This is one of the most natural drum sounds I have ever heard in death metal. There is nothing clicky or tinny within a thousand mile radius of this album. The snare drum could bass for a floor tom in any other situation. It has a very crisp and watery sound to it. While the ride and crash have a brassy and tight sound. My favorite part of the entire drum ensemble however, would go to the double bass. Much like the bass guitar, it only peeks it's head out when it's needed. But when you hear it, it rains down like a tornado of hammers. More specifically in songs like \"Open Casket\". Which, by the way is one of the best tracks on the entire album.\n\nVocals were some of the most crazed and morbid sounding of their time. Chuck sounded like a rabid, snarling mental patient. And he was hell bent on making a mark on your soft tissues. Each howling tortured bark is executed both sloppily and precisely. Chuck's ability to sound both professional and psychotic is what gives this album so much personality.The gritty and ground down vocal style would go on to influence vocalists for years to come. He isn't extremely guttural, nor is he in his extremely high ranges. His growls sound hacked out and wet. No grating constant lows or ear piercing highs to be found here, just the tortured screams of the damned. This laid a foundation which all death metal vocalists should work off of. Your growls should fit how your lyrics should be delivered. He sounds like a man with leprosy, he sounds like a man left for dead. He sounds like a killer realizing what he did in his past life. THIS is how you do death metal vocals right.\n\nNow you probably noticed I didn't mention the soloing very much at all, that's because it needed it's own paragraph. The soloing on this album is so dirty and technical, yet concise and to the point. No wankery to be found within these tracks. The solos in \"Forgotten Past\" and the title track happen to be my favorite. \"Forgotten Past\" for it's jittery spider-like speed crawling solo. And the title track for it's Kerry King like wail, before jumping into some beautifully executed staccato riffing. Every solo has meaning, nothing just gets thrown in for the sake of technicality and show off wank (take notes modern death metal). These kinds of solos would stay consistent with Death up until their final release. No matter how Chuck's riffing would change, he kept his soloing consistently quality-laden.\n\nThis album is not only a death metal classic, but a classic metal record in general. From the morbid and cavern crushing riffs. To the tortured, cackled and vomited vocals, to the heavy bass and booming drums, this album is gold. If you are unsure about death metal, trust me and have a look at this record. It's accessible and catchy, yet brutal and unforgiving. It is the definition of everything good in old school death metal, and shows everything wrong with modern death metal. This album gets a well deserved and christened 10/10.\n",
        "\nThe Sound Of Perseverance is the reason why the frontman Chuck Schuldiner should be considered as the Jimi Hendrix of death metal. The solos are outstanding and nothing can compare: Chuck's guitar can literally talk, period. It's like sharp and warm steel shredding your soul to pieces. Everything about this album is a milestone in its own way: right from the start you will get blown away by the surreal and never-before-heard drumming and the tightest riffage ever. All the album is enhanced by an outstanding, unforgettable, gloomy but vibrant bass and one of the best screaming you can possibly find in death. It's the turning point of metal, it's the peak of the genre and every single album from that point on has to confront with this monolith. Most of the times, it's better to ignore it cause it's something so rich and complex that you'd have better luck trying becoming a book writer: too bad the lyrics kick as much ass and are just as brilliant as the rest. \n\nIt's technical death metal and every musician show off insane skills in each track but don't expect crazy and convoluted song patterns; it is in fact, in some way, rather simple in structure, especially if compared to more modern albums. The jazz influence is there and you're sure to feel it as much as the progressive's but the songs are kind of linear: in other words, the guys don't overdo it with weird time signatures or choppy riffs so expect solid and mostly straightforward songs. It's hard to pick highlights cause there are no weak tracks, no fillers, you never have the impression that a song is going adrift: you just have to pick your favorite among eight steel masterpieces enriched by one of the best and craziest covers ever made by any band: Judas Priest's Painkiller. \n\nSo, is it perfect? No, it's not and I'll tell you why but keep in mind that this album's value goes beyond any criticism cause it threw so many new and polished things on the table of metal that saying anything remotely bad about it is nit-picking. First of all, as much as the singing is top-notch and well-suited it is sometimes somewhat weaker than the lower, thicker scream we were accustomed to in the previous entries of the discography: switching occasionally to an heavier scream could have been a better choice. Secondly, the verse-chorus form can get tiresome considering that this album could have thrown in awesome outros in the cauldron but that's probably just me being eager. Other than that, trying to find more flaws is a real task. If I really, really had to pick the lowest ranked song I'd say \"To Forgive is To Suffer\" cause after six songs that add each something unique to the game, it comes as a \"standard\" which, I admit, is kind of paradoxical. It's like they defined said standard and \"To Forgive\" is the encore to it. \n\nI know I've rocketed your expectations to the moon but every word in this review is carefully weighted and, as much as it is opinion based, I really think that if you are a metal fan of any kind you will agree if I simply say that \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" is special and a must-have. Everything that made and will make metal great, triumphs in this album.\n",
        "\n\"Leprosy will take control\" said the late, great Chuck Schuldiner. Those may have just been lyrics or thoughts of his at the period of time that the album was being recorded and produced, but it became a reality in the death metal world. Leprosy did take control and influenced countless metal bands to try and emulate Death's sound on this release. I can't really say that I heard many others bands on this LP due Just like Obituary with \"Cause of Death,\" Death defied the \"sophomore slump\" that some bands get into after they release an album that is too well done to have a decent follow up. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" is fantastic, but \"Leprosy\" takes the cake in my book for the best Death album. \n\nAlthough obvious that this album is ground-breaking, it is hard to pin point what makes it so great. I definitely argue that it the melodies of the riffs is what sets it apart from the rest. The mix of melodic and the many altered harmonic minor scales and key changes are catchy and very sinister. Every time I listen from 2:49 to 3:19 of \"Choke On It\" chills shoot down my spine and I'm lost in a state of hypnotism. And one thing that makes this record so interesting is that it is melodic yet not too complicated for a new listener to really get into. Death would continue to become more technical and even more complex but Leprosy would always be what many Death fans would come back to.\n\nI enjoyed Chuck Schuldiner's vocals on \"Leprosy\" more than any other Death release. They are guttural, deep, and echo after they are screamed. Part of that is owed to the new production of this album. The guitar quality of Schuldiner and Rick Rozz was a gravelly, heavy roar and the plucking smacking of Schuldiner's bass playing was clear, crisp and entertaining. Whoever mixed the drum tracks at Morrisound Recording put way, way to much power to the snare drum of Bill Andrews. On \"Forgotten Past\" at 0:43 and 1:31 it almost overpowers everything (except for Schuldiner's vocals). Also, some of the song structure is a bit too similar. The most common case of this is definitely the overuse of a guitar intro to introduce the next verse, interlude, chorus, e.t.c. \n\n\"Leprosy's\" lyrical content is what death metal lyrics are made to be. They are unforgiving, grotesque, and depressing as they depict death, gore, sadness, disease, and suffering. Their delivery matches the songs spot-on. It would be interesting to find out what exactly influenced Chuck Schuldiner to write his wonderfully detailed lyrics and how they evolved over the years to come. \n\nSo the question remains: What can you expect from this record? You can expect pure, true, old-school, and flat out mind blowing death metal. \"Leprosy\" is quite possibly the best death metal album of all time along with great records such as \"Cause of Death\" by Obituary, \"Seven Churches\" by Possessed or \"Consuming Impulse\" by Pestilence. Death did \"stake it's claim\" and it absolutely made \"it last.\" Why don't some death metal bands of today don't give the deserved credit to Death that they deserve? I don't know. But one thing's for certain: Death will last forever. R.I.P Chuck Schuldiner.\n",
        "\nDeath\u2019s fourth album, Human, is considered a masterpiece of technical death metal by many. Up until this moment in time, most bands within the death metal genre focused on being as fast and brutal as possible. As soon as the first song begins on Human, you know you are going to be in for a ride. The song begins with a drum solo that leads into the opening guitar riff, setting the tone for the album. The main factor that makes this album so great is that even though the song structures are extremely complex, the songs never seem to get boring. \n\nFirst of all, let\u2019s get into the drumming. The drums were the first thing that struck me as being utterly amazing. Chuck Schuldiner had definitely made a great choice with acquiring their new drummer, Sean Reinert. The speed and precision of the double bass drumming in this album is unbelievable. Sean Reinert manages to keep things interesting, even mixing in some jazz fusion and Latin influences into his playing. Personally, the drums are the best part of this album. Seeing live videos of Reinert playing songs from Human is mind blowing. \n\nThe bass in this album inspired a lot of future death metal bassists, but the bass could have easily been louder in the mixing. The new bassist, Steve DiGiorgio does a superb job. The mini bass solo in Cosmic Sea is one of the best moments of the album. Cosmic Sea does a great job of displaying the band\u2019s diversity, and their ability to write unique songs. Not many metal bands at the time were utilizing the bass on the same level as Death managed to do. \n\nThe guitarists in this album do a great job of utilizing interesting riffs with many odd time signatures. Even though most riffs are extremely fast, the precision of Chuck Schuldiner and Paul Masvidal is striking. The solos on this album NEVER disappoint. Schuldiner and Masvidal have many alternating solos, both with their own unique sound to them. \n\nChuck\u2019s social and political lyrics on this album show how much the band has matured. Compared to the lyrical content of their first few albums, revolving around gore, zombies, and horror films. Song topics include everything from schizophrenia to euthanasia, and Chuck even explores topics such as the question to whether blind people can see in their dreams. Chuck\u2019s vocals are still growled, but seem a bit more audible than in previous albums. \n\nThis album pushed boundaries of speed and technicality in metal music. I never liked death metal until I heard this album, but it totally changed my perspective on the genre. If you take the time to really listen and notice how amazing the musicianship is, it changes how you look at the death metal genre. Without this album, metal today would not be the same. Human is a timeless release that will continue to influence death metal bands for years to come.\n",
        "\nThe copious hype surrounding Death's album \"Symbolic\" is well earned, and this piece of music is worth every word of praise heaped upon it. It is perfect, and that isn't a stretch at all. Chuck Schuldiner, the creative genius behind death metals best (absolute best, most consistent and innovative) group is a bit of a perfectionist, and its clear on this album. The album conveys the feeling that a lot of time and effort were put not only in writing the music, but in practicing and executing it to absolute perfection. Chuck had the unique talent to make extreme metal (or whatever genre you feel like calling it that day, this music doesn't deserve to be lumped into just one genre- it transcends classification) a very beautiful thing, and he achieved that here.\n\nBy this point, Death had gone through a few different lineups, but lets face it, you could give instruments to aborigines and put them in a studio, and as long as Chuck is a part of it, it would come out very very good. This album features Chuck on lead guitar and vocals (he also wrote and composed the whole thing), one of my favorite drummers in any genre in Gene Hoglan, the unknown Bobby Koelble whom Chuck met at the gas station while on his way to the studio (just kidding) on guitar and Kelly Conlon on bass. They all do a very good job, but I think that outside of Chuck, Gene shines the most. He absolutely kicks ass. These songs do an amazing job of conveying raw emotion, it almost seems like your sitting there with Chuck and he is pouring his soul out to you and telling you about what he's gone through in life, both good and bad experiences. It is a very personal experience, and Chuck's vocals here sound less frightening and evil than earlier albums, opting for a very emotional and tormented sound, which, surprise surprise, he executes perfectly. \n\nThe guitar work is excellent; brutal and full of tempo and rhythm changes, catchy, incredibly meaty and full tones with riffs that are extreme but also very melodic and memorable. I would have liked for the bass to be a bit more noticeable, but it is still audible at the right times, and the drumming is not just typical extreme drumming, it is very creative too. The album has a very progressive sound, it isn't just typical death metal. Chuck was going for something more, something deeper (not that there isn't phenomenal death metal out there, but Chuck was very experimental and innovative here). The musicianship is top-notch on \"Symbolic\", and super death metal producer Scott Burns gave it a rather clean sound without sounding sterile, I think he achieved the exact sound the band wanted. \n\nWhat makes this album so great is that it is so engaging and emotional. Any fan of Death knows that Chuck is a very deep and emotional guy, and he carries his emotion on his sleeve (pardon the cliche). After the opening riff om the first and title track Symbolic, the listener is sucked in and stuck there. One would almost feel rude turning the record off without finishing it, it's like Chuck is confiding in you to share something he wouldn't tell anyone else, and that is what takes this album from very good to great. Even if Chuck didn't write such personal and intense lyrics and sang about typical death metal topics, it would still be a very good record, probably worth at least an 80% on here. If you want an intensely emotional, riveting, gorgeously written and flawlessly performed chunk of metal, go listen to this!\n",
        "\nDeath is one of those bands, that album after album they put out quality material. Symbolic is often considered one of Death's best, and it's not hard to see why, as it has some of the best compositions in all of death metal. Chuck and crew knew how to write great material, and this album is no exception to that norm. Fans of other later-day Death albums will love this album, as it is basically just more of the same, just done better here than on most of those other releases. \n\nThis is one of Death's better line ups, only the line up on The Sound of Perseverance beats it in my eyes. The band takes Chucks complex compositions and blows through them as if they were no issue at all. This makes sure the band doesn't sound pushed, and that's one of this albums biggest strengths. Because of the bands skill, Chuck could write the songs he wanted and didn't have to worry about if the band was able to play them or not. All the band members are firing on all cylinders here, as Kelly Conlon, Gene Hoglan, and Bobby Koelble give some of the best performances of their careers. It's something that has to be experienced to understand, but the sonic assault the band provides on this release is nearly unrivaled among all of death metal, a genre known for its musical walls. \n\nThe songs here are of course, progressive and heavy, this is to be expected from Death. However there is a fair amount of non-death metal influence here, the guitar solo from \"Zero Tolerance\" sticks out to me, as it goes for feel over brutality. This is the key difference in their sound from the last record. They sound much more organic, more human, when compared to their previous forays into progressive metal. This feeling of humanity is arguably the greatest strength of this album. It gives death metal a soul, something no other band I've found is able to do so well. The songs here are as progressive as they ever were, but they are delivered with more speed and ferocity here than on other releases. This doesn't mean it is heavier, although it is plenty heavy, it just means that the album is much more energetic than lets say \"Human\" or \"The Sound of Perseverance\". \n\nThe lyrics here are typical of later day Death, talking about death and issues of society. This adds a very intellectual feel to the album, which along with its complex music makes this an album that even the most pretentious of musical aficionados can truly enjoy. This is an album you can feel safe listening to free from judgement, well at least free from judgement that is actually true.\n\nChuck provides a great vocal performance here, and shows why he is a death metal god. His voice is truly evil, yet still understandable. This is one of the best things about this album and of all of Death, Chuck's ability to write great lyrics that can actually be understood by the listener without that person looking at a lyric sheet. This allows even those who need to know the lyrics to focus on the music. \n\nIf you are wanting to get into death metal, Death is one of the best places to start. They manage to be very heavy and complex, but are more accessible than bands like Cancer or Autopsy. This means you can get used to the music, and not have to deal with the disgusting, and often dumb, lyrics that death metal often has. This though, is one of those rare works that serves as both an entry point and as an album you will no doubt be pulling out of your collection even after years of listening to death metal. It's a true beast of an album, and a must have for any death metal fan, or fan of extreme metal in general.\n",
        "\nFew bands have perfect discographies. Death is one of those bands. All of their albums are awesome, and each one pushed death metal into new territories. Chuck and crew always were one step ahead of their competition, and this album is no exception, as they take things to a new level of complexity.\n\nFrom the beginning, the drum intro of \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", you know this is going to be a good album. When the lead guitar kicks in, you know this will be something more than just a good album. Finally, Chucks vocals come in, and you finally realize what kind of awesome quality you're in for on this disk. With Chuck's songwriting talent in full flight, and the extremely talented band working at full force, there isn't a moment here that feels wasted.\n\nThis album is even more progressive than the last, and this is both its biggest strength in terms of quality, and what makes the album matter. This proved just HOW progressive death metal could get and still be good. With each album, Death got more progressive, but here they take it as far as perhaps possible. This progressiveness works everywhere on this LP, but the songs \"Spirit Crusher\", \"Flesh and the Power it Holds\", and \"Story to Tell\" are pure magic, mostly due to their progressive tendencies. \n\nThis is an album that draws from a creative pool, filled with Watchtower, Atheist, and Cynic, but is still 100%, unadulterated Death. There is no way to confuse this album for someone else's. If you have heard Death before, you'll be able to tell who's album this is. For an album to so clearly build off other bands work, yet have an identity completely its own is quite rare. No one can truly imitate Death. This is what makes Death so... them, their sound has been copied, but never reproduced at anywhere near the quality of what the band themselves made.\n\nThis is an album that requires your full attention to really appreciate. Even the instrumental \"Voice of the Soul\" can't fully be understood unless the listener is dedicated to listening to it. Few Death metal vocalist can sound as evil as Chuck, yet still be understandable. Being one of the few death metal bands where a person can know what is being said without having to look at a lyric sheet is a huge bonus, this also makes claims that no one can understand death metal lyrics moot for this record. This also means that you can focus on the music and still know the lyrics, allowing you to appreciate both the music and the lyrics, something quite special. \n\nI feel a whole paragraph is needed to honor the greatest cover ever, Death's cover of Judas Priest's Painkiller. What can be said about this cover that hasn't been said by so many before me. It has Chuck's best vocal performance, kicking off with a scream, who's qualities can be used to describe the rest of the songs vocals, that is equally death metal as it is power metal. Just as beautiful as it is raspy. Chuck screeches his way though this song, and I think it would make Rob Halford proud. Not to mention the rest of the band does a great job with the music, it is both faster, heavier, and ever so slightly different so it doesn't just seem like a redone version of the song, it almost feels like a different song entirely. Guitarist Shannon Hamm, bassist Scott Clendenin, and drummer Richard Christy (of course with Chuck) form what is without a doubt the single best line up of Death, and one of the most technically skilled line ups found in any band ever. \n\nI think if any single person was responsible for the explosion of death metal during the 90's, Evil Chuck (R.I.P.) would be as good an answer as any. His beyond impressive vocal skills, and his godlike guitar abilities made Death a band impossible to match. As I am 15, I never got the chance to see Death live, but the YouTube videos I've seen of their performances were quite impressive. Few bands this technical can actually play the stuff they write well live, but Death could. This paired with his unrivaled songwriting talent made Death, and death metal, a force to be reckoned with. Their complexity and intellectual lyrics (should have) put to rest claims of metal being the musical choice of imbeciles.\n\nThis is an album fans of Spastic Ink will like just as much as fans of Cannibal Corpse will like, assuming they have some appreciation for the other bands sub-genre. This is Death at their best. This is death metal at its best. This is a metal classic in every way, and is a necessary purchase. If you call yourself a fan of extreme metal, you can't go though your life and not have heard this album at least once, and I would find it hard to believe if you didn't love every second of this awesome, awesome album.\n",
        "\nI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s safe to call \u201cLeprosy\u201d Death\u2019s finest hour, right? I mean, it pretty much captures the Death tribe retching up some of the sickest staples of primitive death metal ever while the innards of the excellent \u201cScream Bloody Gore,\u201d another obligatory classic, gestate noticeably on the side. And yeah, all of Death\u2019s records are high in substance (though I don\u2019t care for \u201cThe Sound of Perseverance\u201d all that much) and dynamic in their own unique ways, which obviously makes Death the antithesis of a band like Annihilator whose legacy rides on one excellent record while the others fight for scraps. That consistency is a hallmark trait of a superior band; Death\u2019s legacy remains a monumental statement in the world of death metal for obvious reasons.\n\nBut that\u2019s old news, and everyone knows that. Death is the Geico of death metal, minus the shitty sense of humor. The great thing about \u201cLeprosy\u201d is that it\u2019s not necessarily the seminal Death album, but for several reasons the seminal Death album of a certain era of the group when the band was undoubtedly at its peak, at least in my opinion. I just think it\u2019s the perfect representation of Death from the blistering title track to the insane madness of its closing number\u2014no frills, fillers, byproducts, or bullshit. \u201cLeprosy\u201d is pure death metal, and a metal masterpiece that remains one of the genre\u2019s finest moments.\n\nThe fact remains that \u201cLeprosy\u201d has not depreciated one iota; this has to do with the fundamental traits of death metal itself. Not to give you a history lesson here, but this was released in 1988 when the genre was still stumbling around blindly in a dark room, discovering itself and the world around it. \u201cLeprosy\u201d is important because it\u2019s one of the first clear actions of the death metal identity kicking down the wall and making its presence known; one of few masterpieces that first hit the switch. And really, who could call its blueprint anything but spectacular? It all boils down to a number of parts integrated properly to make complex, structured anthems that bite like razor blades and stick around indefinitely like truly memorable music tends to.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a difference between catchy and memorable. I always assumed \u2018catchy\u2019 was more of a tangible quality; music becomes catchy through repetition and accessible musicianship. To be memorable requires truly exceptional material that is . . . well, truly exceptional. Memorable music doesn\u2019t need to be tangibly repetitive or intentionally accessible because it already has the necessary components to make itself remarkable, and that\u2019s how \u201cLeprosy\u201d succeeds. The songs dip up and down like a rollercoaster of death metal\u2019s signature moves in excellent progressions that are both complex and mesmerizing.\n\nOn the instrumental side of things, \u201cLeprosy\u201d is the best example of unfiltered death metal. These songs are stuffed with what are debatably some of the finest tremolo riffs the genre has ever known and perfectly measured mid-to-slow-paced sections that add huge depth and explosiveness to the mayhem. Percussion patterns are heavy on the bass-snare designs and double bass kicks are given ample room on the backdrop, and the hugely disgusting growling vocals match the flow of the band as they naturally surge from section to section. The album can really be diced up and dissected rather simply, but its few parts make its majesty untouchable. \n\nChuck and Rick Rozz were a killer guitar duo. Here they throw up dozens of riffs and every single one of them is memorable, even legendary. Not once do the frenzied, slicing tremolo riffs and those sickeningly slow guitar grooves filling these tunes halt, and not once does the magic fade. Hey, these songs are some of the finest death metal staples ever: try to argue the title track, \u201cLeft to Die, and \u201cPull the Plug\u201d are just your run-of-the-mill death metal tunes. \u201cPull the Plug\u201d is definitely one of the finest surfaces ever built on this unhallowed soil; it\u2019s undoubtedly a classic of the genre. Now add another seven songs that are just as ruthless, vile, maniacal, frenzied and brutal, and that\u2019s \u201cLeprosy\u201d in a nutshell.\n\nIts atmosphere is the little rotted cherry on the sundae of guts. The guitars are thick and ravaging against the explosive bass work and the outstanding percussion. Obviously Chuck\u2019s growls are a wonderful representation of the album at large\u2014uncooked, beastly, horrifying. The drums seem to be a focal point of criticism around the album due to the unmixed, explosive snare drum that sounds like a bomb going off every second, but you know what? I love these blaring snare beats. They\u2019re like a perfect side of garnish to the raw, rotten, primitive sound quality and atmosphere coursing through the bones of \u201cLeprosy,\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t change them for a million dollars. I can\u2019t imagine that bulldozing beat on the introduction of \u201cForgotten Past\u201d to be any less bold if the snare were properly mixed.\n\nI love \u201cLeprosy.\u201d Is there a ton of variety? No. Are their huge orchestral movements and woodland instruments? No. Is the production shiny and flawless? No. Is your asshole going to be pounded like there\u2019s no tomorrow every time you listen to it? Yes, yes, and yes. It\u2019s filthy, disgusting, vile, repulsive, and mercilessly devilish from the slow opening booms of the title track to Chuck screaming at the listener to CHOKE ON IT! AS YOUR TONGUE GOES DOWN! \u201cLeprosy\u201d is great because it\u2019s unapologetically dirty and honest, a picture of one of metal\u2019s best bands at one of their many heights; it is pureblooded death metal for thirty-eight minutes. So, in sum, you may keep your Fleshgod Apocalypses and your Black Dahlia Murders\u2014I\u2019m good with this. \n\nThis review was written for: www.Thrashpit.com\n",
        "\n''Scream Bloody Gore'' is the bible of death metal. It was the reference for countless bands worldwide that started to play this fast, crushing and insane genre of music, everyone making it in their own way, helping the style to evolve and leaving several legendary releases. But this one has EVERYTHING. It's the base for all those bands who came later. It represents death metal sound in it's pure form, and every death metal fan worships this with devotion and pleasure. Let's start with the most notable elements of this masterpiece:\n\n\nTHE RIFFS! Is the essence of this album: An excellent selection of incredible riffs created by the master Chuck Schuldiner. ''Denial of Life'' has some of the best ones. For example, that thrashy intro, and then the explosive fast-paced riff where Chuck insanely screams: ''In your dreams, the pain is so real, Before the dead, you'll have to kneel..''. Epic moment indeed. Another nice riff, is this catchy line on ''Zombie Ritual'': ''Drifting from the living, joining with the dead, Zombie dwelling maggots, now infest your head''. As i said, is so catchy, yet intensely brutal and raw, because that is what this album is about, insane riffs, like the ultra-fast one in ''Baptized with blood'' when chuck starts singing, and also the solos... they are just decent, not too technical, but accurate and effective, they follow the standard soloing thrashy style of the mid-80s.\n\n\nThe bass is also an important element in this album. It was played by Chuck, and fortunately you can hear it as loud as the guitars, and it gives the music a really nice old-school, raw, brutal feeling. The drums give the songs a relentless energy, the patterns are very simple, making the standard blast-beats that were so frequent in 80s death and thrash metal, they were played by the amazing Chris Reifert, who later left the band to form his own band: Autopsy, legendary gods of death metal.\n\nThe vocals are a very special element on this album. Death metal didn't used the typical low-tone growling (Cannibal Corpse, Necrophagist) in 1987, but instead, Chuck sang like a fucking insane warrior of death metal. He is very versatile, mixing brutal mid-tone screams, with uncontrolled high-pitched ones, he sounds like a fucking demon! Sometimes it seems like he is really in pain while singing. The lyrics he sings are typical gore, mutilation, bloody lyrics, with some great lines, when you read them you think this guy has escaped from an asylum, for example, in ''Torn to Pieces'': ''Trying to escape they torture you by cutting off your cock''. Insane...\n\nThis is a legendary, underrated album, highly recommended for avid death metal fans. Every song has it's own personality and every time you listen to this is a full experience. Don't miss it.\n",
        "\nThis album marked Death's transistion from raw, riff-heavy, gore filled brutality to a more cerebral and melodic/progressive sound with more socially relevant topics. With Scott Burns' trademark recording, Chuck Schuldiner's brilliant lyrics, and James Murphy's signature tone and incomparable soloing ability, this is easily one of Death's best efforts, yet it always seems to get swept under the rug when it comes to their discography.\n\nRather than be just another death metal band that talks about gore and violence, Chuck decides to mature and personalize his music. He sings about the philosophical consequences of ending a life. He delves into what it's like inside the criminal mind. The human condition. The hypocrisy of televangelism. And even begins dipping his toes into the more personal, introspective lyrics. Stuff that makes you think and doesn't just bombard you with gory imagery.\n\nThis album is a break away from traditional death metal in that it's not all pure speed and aggression, but rather more mid paced and ominous. It also shows off Death's beginning transition from OSDM to technical and progressive death metal. The unusual riffs and precise solos are a clear exhibition in Death's branching out from \"just another death metal\" band to the death metal band who is changing the face of death metal.\n\nSpiritual Healing is an especially solo driven album. James and Chuck's trade-offs are some of the best ever recorded. Low Life is the perfect example of how to properly execute a trade-off. That's not to say the riffs are forgettable, but the solos are definitely the highlight of this album. What often goes unnoticed (as with many bands) is the rhythm section. Bill Andrews forgoes the typical blast beat face melting and instead implements a more subdued and melodic approach. That's not to say he can't roll the double bass, but he only does it when it's necessary. Terry Butler can match Chuck's intricate riffing note-for-note without being drowned out. Both Bill and Terry definitely hold their own against Chuck and James. \n\nThis is most certainly Death's most underrated album. But even in the company of a flawless discography full of death metal classics still cited to this day as \"all time greatest\", it holds up to the test of time. The only reason I can think as to why it's so underrated is because it was so ahead of it's time, even for Death. Whatever you do, do not sleep on this album.\n",
        "\nON VHS\u2026 not DVD \n\nI felt like I should file this under \u201cmusic DVD\u201d, but it\u2019s not a DVD or a classic album, but more of a classic VHS. Can you believe I\u2019m saying that in 2013? Classic VHS indeed it is! The VHS never came out on DVD, and is out of print for obvious reasons. I should probably get it transferred to DVD sometime soon. And yes I still watch it on VHS.\n\nUltimate Revenge 2 \u2013vs- Ultimate Revenge 1 \n\nThe Ultimate Revenge 2, \u201cVHS\u201d is not the same setup as the Ultimate Revenge 1 VHS. For one, UR2 only contains the concert, unlike UR1 which had an interview with Slayer and Venom. Two, UR1 had the concert from Slayer and Exodus, but Venom\u2019s footage wasn\u2019t even live footage from the UR1concert. Here\u2019s probably why, which is a quote from Slayer drummer, Dave Lombardo in the August 2006 issue of Decibel Magazine \n\n\u201cI remember Tom getting punched by Cronos [Venom]. We were in the back of the bus drinking, and we were just totally hammered. It was our first time on a tour bus. I remember Venom started the tour with these extravagant tour buses, but by the end of the tour, they were bankrupt and driving around in cars. So Jeff and I were drinking in the back of the bus with Cronos I think we were playing \u2018Hell Awaits\u2019 for him. Tom came in, hammered out of his mind, going, \u2018I gotta take a piss! Where\u2019s the bathroom in this thing?\u2019 And Cronos goes, \u2018Right here right here in my mouth!\u2019 And Tom took him literally. He pulled down his pants, whipped it out, and went to the bathroom on Cronos\u2019 hair. Cronos got up, grabbed Tom, and punched him in the face. They spent the rest of the night blaming each other, and Tom did the rest of the tour with a black eye.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Dave Lombardo (Decibel Magazine/August 2006)\n\nThere you go! As you can see, Tom Araya\u2019s right eye is covered by his hair. Slayer and Exodus\u2019 sets were recorded at Studio 54 in New York City. I\u2019m sure Venom got sent home. \n\nUltimate Revenge 2 and the bands sets \n\nNow back to the bands from Ultimate Revenge 2. The concert for Ultimate Revenge 2 was recorded at The Trocadero Theater in Philadelphia, PA in October 1988. To this day, The Trocadero remains a concert hall, and is still going strong.\n\nForbidden\u2019s set wasn\u2019t great. I\u2019m not really into their music. Drummer, Paul Bostaph played that set. You may remember him from Slayer and Testament.\n\nFaith or Fear were the only local South Jersey/Philly band that played that show. Their set was solid punk influenced, thrash metal. To this day, 2/5 members of F.O.F. remain in the band, when they reunited in 2008. They are still together, however, bassist, CJ Jenkins, who died in 2009 from a heart attack on stage during a show, Guitarist, Bob Perna who was in the band for a bit, but isn\u2019t anymore, and drummer, Rich Lohwasser are all not in the band anymore.\n\nDeath\u2019s set was great. They were supporting the Leprosy album, and had the lineup playing for that show from that album, consisting of Bill Andrews (Drums), Terry Butler (bass), Rick Rozz (Guitar), and the late, great, \u201cEvil\u201d Chuck Schuldiner (Guitar, Vocals). What\u2019s ironic is that five years later asked Hoglan to play in Death, in which he was on the album Individual Thought Patterns and Symbolic in 1995. Why is it ironic? Check out this quote from the March 2011 Death special issue of Decibel Magazine. \n\n\u201cWe had done the Ultimate Revenge II tour. That didn\u2019t work out too well for anyone. Dark Angel and Death didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye on some things. It got heated and Death walked off the tour. When Borivoj Krgin called me in September or October 1992 and said \u201cHey man, Chuck is looking for a drummer. Are you interested?\u201d I was like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s weird. I thought we were enemies?\u201d So, Borivoj game me Chuck\u2019s number and bygones were bygones. Early December is when I went out to rehearse for Individual Thought Patterns. After about three weeks, we cut the record. \u2013 Gene Hoglan (Decibel Magazine, March 2011)\n\nDark Angel\u2019s set was unbelievable! They had the most energy live and their songs are a million miles per minute. Vocalist, Ron Reinhert had amazing energy, headbanging with the audience members. Drummer, Gene Hoglan was twenty one years old then. His single stroke rolls on \u201cBurning of The Sodom\u201d in the intro were great on the snare drum! From what I read in Modern Drummer, he still uses the same bass drum pedals he used from that tour. No one from Dark Angel made it successfully after they broke up, except Hoglan, who was in a number of different bands from, Death, Fear Factory, Strapping Young Lad, and now, Testament.\n\nRaven\u2019s set wasn\u2019t that great. I thought they were a bit misplaced on the lineup. It was a mostly thrash metal show, minus them and Death, but Raven\u2019s music is very cheesy. I believe the show would have been better to end with Dark Angel.\n\n- Andrew Hoxter\nhttp://andrewhoxter.wordpress.com\n",
        "\n(Subtitle: \"Crushed under its own weight\")\n\nWhat time is it?! Time for another installment of Jerking the Circle! Yes kids, the series wherein I take a look at albums that get tons and tons of praise from certain groups within the metal community (or just the community at large). Today we look at a band that released some stunningly great albums, and instead focus on what is by far their worst one. Goddammit Chuck, remove your head from your anus, por favor.\n\nDeath had a moderately lengthy and quite illustrious career, spanning seven albums of wildly varying sounds and an even more unpredictable lineup. And this, Individual Thought Patterns marks both their lowest point as a band, and also (bafflingly) their most star studded lineup. Death has always basically been Chuck Schuldiner's Revolving Band Selected Via Musical Chairs Matches, and in 1993 he managed to strike potential gold by retaining the fretless hobo of Sadus fame, Steve DiGiorgio, and bailing on the technically proficient but writing impaired hacks from Cynic and replaced them with goddamn Andy LaRocque (known for King Diamond), and motherfucking Gene Hoglan (known for every fucking band ever). Seriously, you ever play that game where you daydream up the ultimate band? Chuck Schuldiner fucking did that, and whatever personality issues the man had that caused members to leave constantly/him to constantly kick them out, I really wished he would have found a way to rein it in around this era, because there is so much star power potential in here I could go blind by looking at it.\n\nAnd then I actually heard the album.\n\nYeah, I guess stars are prone to supernovas, because this is an unmitigated disaster. Don't get me wrong, despite my general distaste for prog, I don't dislike the fact that Chuck decided to take the band in a more progressive direction (they were pretty much devoid of death metal from this point onwards). Hell Symbolic is probably my favorite album by the band, just a smidgeon above Leprosy. But this here is a goddamn trainwreck. This is what happens when somebody who's good at being hard and fast and heavy decides that that path is too stupid and instead tries to be more intellectual about everything. And hey, to his credit, he did eventually figure it out, because Symbolic is great, but Chuck didn't have a goddamn idea what he was doing when writing this album. Listening to this in one sitting, I'd be hard pressed to tell you where each song ends and a new one begins, much less which song is even actually playing, even after a decade of being a Death fan. \n\nThere are moments of brilliance scattered throughout, as \"Destiny\" has a fantastic riff hidden somewhere in the middle, as does \"Nothing is Everything\" and \"Overactive Imagination\", but that's really all I can do for critique; pick out random bits from random songs and tell you whether it's good or bad. It's woefully unprofessional, and I get that, but it really feels like the album was written and recorded in that same haphazard direction. Lots of shit happens, but I don't think anybody other than Chuck himself actually knew why. This is probably the most literal collection of riffs and ideas I've ever heard. Very few sections repeat later in a song, it's basically just a 40 minute gag reel of jazzy proto-tech-prog ideas that the band was noodling around with but couldn't really decide on how to arrange. So they just decided to play them all in one long 40 minute take, arbitrarily consider it a new track every four minutes or so, and call it a day. It's a shame because the talent is obviously there, but at this point Chuck was no longer in a transition phase, and therefore had neither that excuse nor the leftover bits of pummeling death metal morbidity that he had on Human. Individual Thought Patterns is instead it's own entity with no crutch to lean on, which is unfortunate because it's rather malformed and disabled.\n\nThere was also a quite bizarre malady that plagued the band during this middle era as well, and that was that the more technical, proggy, and wanky the music got, the shorter the average song was. The average song lengths on both Human and Individual Thought Patterns are shorter than their more simplistic predecessors in Leprosy and Spiritual Healing. This kind of writing (when not done in such a slapdash and poorly arranged manner) definitely lends itself to a more spaced out format. I normally prefer shorter songs, mind you (one of the reasons Gama Bomb will always be better than Cyclone Temple), but nothing here has room to breathe or develop. Instead we're presented with ten claustrophobic and rushed exercises in vaguely deathy progjazz. Again, the entire album is presented as a collection of unrelated things, and that's basically the end of it right there where it starts.\n\nThe production job is also a nagging whack in the shins, as like with the previous album, it's rather thin and lacks the punch of their earlier recordings. We've all heard Leprosy, we understand how good they can sound. The guitar tone on that album was as thick as a baby's arm, and yet here it's this wispy gossamer. I realize they were going for more precision and less chunk, but the music is noticeably less powerful this time around and it suffers for it. The widdly wanky parts are well suited to this kind of sound, I'll admit, but there are occasions when real riffs and double bass and whatnot actually do happen, and they end up laughably weak in the grand scheme of things. \"Weak\" is an adjective that applies only to this album throughout all of Death's discography, and that's a giant mark against it.\n\nOverall this is too jazzy and not thought out enough for it's own good. There are far too many segments where the instruments all just kind of break down into their own thing and all wander away from each other. The percussion is definitely prone to this, with Hoglan being wildly misused and left to just mostly fuck around with bizarre cymbal patterns. When Chuck reined it in on the following two albums and focused more on cohesive songwriting and logical progression, they knocked it out of the park. But here? Not at all, not yet. The kinda awkward but still good transition phase in Human had long passed, and they were fully into the prog territory at this point, but frankly, the songwriter here still wasn't entirely sure of himself, and as a result Individual Thought Patterns is a complete mess, and probably the only skippable album in Death's entire career.\n\n\nOriginally written for Lair of the Bastard\n",
        "\nFor most metal albums, it is possible to decipher typical riff structures, typical transitions and other \"standard\" song-writing techniques used in them, even if they sound \"unique\". I've heard extremely few albums that have made me wonder \"How the hell did he come up with that riff/transition?\" as Symbolic, Death's sixth release. And that's what it is in my opinion - a songwriting marvel. Most riffs are great - some are pure amazing without being overly technical - but the sheer creative genius of front-man Chuck Schuldiner lies in the way everything is blended together, amalgamated into well-structured songs.\n\nFor example, the title track is comprised of a host of great riffs with varying tempos, and one seamless transition after another only serves to greatly enhance the overall song. Every song on the album is like that, rather than just being a collection of cool riffs or solos. All the tracks have ample lead guitar work, apart from the solos, which adds a nice touch to the underlying rhythm work. A stand-out in this regard is Crystal Mountain, which is so replete with outstanding lead parts (especially the god-like tapping harmony just before the solo) that it has become the clear favorite for a majority of people.\nEven if one disregards the rhythm work, the solos by guitarists Chuck Schuldiner and Bobby Koelble are both technical and tasteful. They have distinct styles and it's always a pleasure to listen to them trade-off in the middle of songs (highlights in this regard being Perennial Quest and Zero Tolerance). One last thing I'd like to mention for guitars are the acoustic parts at the end of Crystal Mountain and Perennial Quest; in my opinion these 2 songs give a very good example of how death metal can be \"soulful\", and how acoustic guitars can be incorporated into death metal songs.\n\nI cannot comment much on bass (limited knowledge regarding that), but the drums certainly need a mention. Gene Hoglan managed to come up with ridiculously catchy drum beats that aren't merely complementary to the guitars. His drumming has a distinct identity without being over-the-top in any department, be it in terms of cymbal work, fills, etc. By itself, Hoglan's work adds a lot more to the songs than standard death metal drumming would. Again, the title track is a good example - the drum parts accompanying all the riffs give it a great sense of speed variation. Like the guitars, the drumming is tasteful throughout, with appropriately-placed fills, double-bass parts and -especially- the ride cymbal usage.\n\nI apologize for not writing about the downsides, but with whatever subjective preferences I have, I really haven't found any faults with this album. Others may, depending on their tastes. From my side I would strongly suggest at least giving it a listen, because once it grows on you (if it needs to grow on you), it's hard to put down.\n",
        "\nAlmost anyone who has ever heard the band will admit that few bands can boast a career as rich with ripe material as Death. From their inception the band consistently pumped out albums that were solid to fantastic; until their career was cut short with the tragic demise of Chuck Schuldiner. The band were formed in 1983 under the name of Mantas and released seven albums after changing their name to Death, with each one developing and expanding their sound until their final release incorporated so many different elements that it was a wonder it did not collapse in on itself. The band rose to fame by taking thrash metal to new extremes and creating the death metal genre almost single-handedly with \"Scream Bloody Gore\", before they would later shift toward a more progressively-oriented sound on their final four albums. Alongside \"Human\", \"Symbolic\" is frequently ranked the best Death album by many people.\n\nThe band's penultimate release was the album where the band's progressive nature really came to the forefront of their sound instead of the raw aggression that had fueled the previous two releases. Whereas \"Individual Thought Patterns\" and \"Human\" crammed many riffs into a short space of time; \"Symbolic\" was all about the constantly evolving song structures that carried it forward. The guitar work that drives Death's sound was arguably at its peak on \"Symbolic\" with many riffs that maintain a high standard throughout from the opening riff to the title track to the closing moments of the eight minute epic \"Perennial Quest\". The tempo is considerably slower than that of previous albums by the band for the most part aside from a few tremolo picked guitar lines here and there, as the album is primarily about all the twists and turns in the music instead of the speed it moves along at. This album is also quite a bit longer than the bands past material but it makes great use of this time with one of the best flowing exhibitions of extreme metal ever heard.\n\nOn the rhythm side of things, it would be fare to say that the drumming on this album, courtesy of Gene Hoglan of former Dark Angel fame, is varied and technically proficient whilst the bass work thunders forward and takes no prisoners. The vocals are rather unique on here and Chuck really does provide the perfect voice for the thought-provoking lyrics he writes. He screams in a high pitched manner instead of the low growl that dominated the past five releases from the band, and right from the opening lines of the album \"I don't mean to dwell, but I can't help myself\" you know you are in for something special. This is an album that takes its listener on an adventure through the twisted song structures that are constantly providing something fresh, be it an unsuspected acceleration in pace or an acoustic solo as found in \"Crystal Mountain\". \"Zero Tolerance\" is one note-worthy song on \"Symbolic\", opening with a slight breather for the listener after the incredible opener with the title track, but then suddenly you are thrown head first into a mountain of monstrous riffs and chaotic guitar soloing. \n\n\"This is not a test of power.\nThis is not a game,\nTo be lost or won,\nLet justice be done.\nThere will be Zero Tolerance\"\n\nLyrics such as the ones above display a level of depth that only Chuck Schuldiner can provide with his philosophical approach to writing. All throughout this album one will find deep and interesting lyrics that always have a meaning that relate to some element of society. \"Crystal Mountain\" arguably has the best lyrics on the album, referring to a mountain of greed and deception whilst using that as a means to get Chuck's real point across in that people are full of the aforementioned traits. \n\nThe songs on \"Symbolic\" are utterly majestic. The title track constantly changes tempo with some great drumming and one of the best palm muted riffs I have ever heard during the chorus. \"Perennial Quest\" is a work of wonder that takes you on such a journey of fluctuating tempos and contrasting styles throughout its entire eight and a half minute duration that it is a miracle the band pulled it off with the finesse they managed. \"Misanthrope\" and \"Without Judgment\" never cease to amaze with some great riffing and \"Empty Words\" is arguably the crowning achievement of the album with its absolutely ludicrous guitar performance. Each song on \"Symbolic\" is nothing short of a masterpiece and they are all complimented by the perfect production job. The guitars are heavy, the drums do not feel flat, the bass work is audible and Chuck's vocals are well mixed. There are absolutely no flaws to be found throughout the entire nine track and sub-fifty minute duration.\n\n\"Symbolic\" is an air tight display of intense music that consistently evolves and adapts as the guitars create a chaotic and yet beautiful backdrop for Chuck to shriek his intelligent tales over the top of. If you have not heard \"Symbolic\", I honestly recommend that you do so immediately as this really is an album that is for absolutely anybody.\n",
        "\nI was introduced to Death via Symbolic and Human several years ago. I later found Individual Thought Patterns and The Sound of Perseverance and then this album, Scream Bloody Gore, which I considered a complete anomaly. SBG, as I will refer to it, was quickly put away and forgotten...\n\n...until two weeks ago. Having bought tickets to see the new Death to All tour featuring the Human line-up playing songs from Human and prior, I figured it was time to truly dig in and listen to Leprosy, Spiritual Healing, and SBG for what they were worth. The short is SBG takes a couple songs to truly find its death metal stride, but once the gore train gets a-rolling, it becomes enjoyable.\n\nI believe there were 2 issues standing in my way of enjoying SBG upon first listen. The first problem was that I wasn't taking the album in context. Jumping from Symbolic to SBG is a HUGE leap, one that will make SBG sound much worse than it actually is. The second problem was (and always will be) the first two songs, \"Infernal Death\" and \"Zombie Ritual\", but I'll get to that later. \n\nFor the time when this album came out, a period where serious death and black metal were first getting their shit together, SBG is well-developed and for the most part consistent. Death had a distinct and unique sound back in 1987, especially impressive when you consider how old many of the songs are. Chuck Schuldiner wanted a B-horror movie vibe band back in the day and he certainly achieved that on SBG. SBG feels evil, fast, raw, and slightly corny, just like any bad (or great, depending on your perspective) '80s horror movie.\n\nI find that SBG is taken better as a whole, as many of the songs sound similar with little variation in the drumming and bass. The drums and bass are consistent, but nothing you'll remember tomorrow or the day after. If you came to SBG for the bass and drums, you're missing the point. If you're going to look at the individual songs, SBG gets off to a slow start. \"Infernal Death\" and \"Zombie Ritual\" are actually my least favorite songs on the album. They never seem to hit their stride, especially \"Zombie...\" which just doesn't ever realize its potential. But if you are able to get through these first two tracks (or skip them, like I do), the rest of SBG is significantly better. The choruses are fantastic, Chuck shrieks like a bat out of Hell, and you can even hear small hints of the incredible progressive band which Death would eventually become. Don't believe me? Take a listen to the intro of the album standout \"Evil Dead\". It sounds like something that could have been written for Individual Thought Patterns.\n\nScream Bloody Gore is a powerful statement of what Death once was. It's unapologetic, mean, and ends way too fast once it gets going. Well worth the listen.\n",
        "\nYep that's right peeps. This really is what set the bar as we know all today as death metal. I'll be blunt as fuck as say this is death metal's first work and not Possessed's Seven Churches. Without going into a random tangent, it simply does not sound like death metal. Simply put its just another thrash band that has a Slayer influence. Although I would say the name of the genre came from their track on the album. Well now that that's out of the way, let's get to the REAL reason I joined the death metal world in the first place.\n\nI really didn't think anything was more extreme then Slayer during the time when I only listened to thrash metal back then, and also didn't think that no album was more extreme then Reign in Blood. Well this is the landmark album that did it in my opinion, and would later lead to other bands trying to overpower this album entitled, Scream Bloody Gore.\n\n10 tracks that clock under at least 38 minutes. My my what music for my ears. I didn't know what to expect from this album really other then extreme metal or as we like to call it death metal. After listening to the first track entitled \"Infernal Death\", I was blown away and it exceeded my expectations tremendously. The spotlight was all towards the mastermind himself and the \"Father of death metal\", Chuck Schuldiner. The first of his kind in terms of growl, and screech like vocals. This guy truly was a visionary for what he had planned for the following years to come, and would be the cornerstone of death metal in general. \n\nThe sound of Scream Bloody Gore has a Slayer influence written all over this, but a bit more extreme. Its raw with no problems whatsoever as I'm listening to all these tracks. Everything flows through fine. Guitars are crunchy and have that downtune sound you'd expect to hear, bass is very noticeable. Drums can be a bit too overpowering at times, but that has no effect on the listening experience, and finally, the vocals obviously, compliment the albums sound very nicely; and it being the most prevalent thing about this album. \n\nNow my favorite track on this album is \"Zombie Ritual\" holy shit. If you want to find the best song on here, forget the rest listen to this one as it will instantly hook you on for a thrill ride mainly by the lyrics. I feel like this is a proper track to use or listen to when you're watching a horror or zombie movie. Wow what a track not to mention the most standout line from this song is obviously \"zooooooombieeee....rituuALLLLL\". Seriously stop what you're doing and listen to this song.\n\nProblems I have with this album? Well first It can a bit boring after a while mainly due to no variety on the drums side. It seems like every song there seems to be a bit of the same pattern going on but its 1987 so thats alright. The main reason this doesn't get a perfect score is the fact that the track entitled \"Torn to Pieces\" sounds like a filler track, and its my least favorite on the album with it being average at best.\n\nAll in all this album was a huge inspiration to many death metal bands and I can see why. It has the complete package of what death metal sounds like today and any fan who loves a nice hybrid of thrash/death metal or just death metal in general will enjoy this. For those who just started listening to Death and finished listening to this album. I encourage you to listen to their whole discography, because just by listening to this album, and already listened to the entire discography, the band has hidden potential here that would later showcase themselves as true craftsman of the genre, and why they are truly a prime manifestation as being one of the best acts in the genre itself.\n",
        "\nFor the longest time, Human was my favorite Death album. There was just something about that one album, the raw aggression found in its 34 minute running length that i felt was completely unrivaled. Since listening to their discography multiple times in a row again, however, this album has slowly sunk back to being my third favorite Death release, behind the two albums that would follow. That is NOT to say that Human is patchy at all, however, as it is by no means bad. Human is, in fact, darn near perfection incarnate. This is a blisteringly fast lesson in aggression, speed, progression and just general absolutely fantastically crafted death metal. Only Death could create this form of unrivaled hatred in music form, whilst still containing riffs so heavy they could take Chuck Norris off his feet. Human was originally 8 tracks long, however this review will be including the ninth track as well, God Of Thunder, a cover of kiss included on the re-release.\n\nHuman is, primarily, a string of some of the best riffs found in any genre of music on the face of the earth, of varied tempo, but all containing the rage that characterized Death, and made them stand out so much among the pretensive scene that they created. Bands such as Obituary and Cannibal Corpse, with their gore soaked lyrics, could not even comprehend the hate that Death had in their music. This is the sound of a group of young musicians who are completely angry at everything around them and Chuck penned lyrics that speak directly about this hatred. The first three songs on the album, Flattening Of Emotions, Suicide Machine and Together as One, all showcase this perfectly. Together as one has by far the best chorus Death ever put out, with some insightful lyrics and riffs drilled into your head with the force to take a building down. Chuck Schuldiner had one of the finest musical brains of all time, and this is displayed with every single guitar line throughout the album, containing so many influences, and would go on to influence every band ever to come after.\n\nThis was also the album where Death changed. Death went from being a raw, brash, in your face death metal band to a more progressive-inclined band, whilst still retaining that death sound that they created almost single-handedly. This all comes to its peak on the instrumental of the album, Cosmic Sea, a beautifully composed piece that really does have elements of every style of music that Chuck was influenced by. There are classical tinges in there, hard rock elements, a lacing of blues, and, of course, heavy fucking metal. This is where everything the band did came together perfectly. Each and every song found throughout this record is a masterpiece in its own right. They are all completely different, and to explain them all would require a university-length piece. Each and every one is a classic of the genre, and they have all stood the test of time, being 21 years old and still riding high among the wave of death metal masterpieces. The genre has become stagnant, and this was one of the albums that caused this, as very few bands could ever live up to a precedent such as this.\n\nHuman may not be the best thing that Death ever put out, being left trailing by Symbolic, and being outdone by following album Individual Thought Patterns, but it remains an exercise in how death metal should be done flawlessly, with furious guitar work throughout. The solos are perfect for the album, and every riff flows into the next one throughout. However, if you thought the talent ends there, you would be vastly mistaken. Sean Reinert is a wizard behind the drum kit, laying down some solid beats upon which the songs are formed, being interesting and complex enough to avoid boring the listener. Steve DiGiorgio is another extremely talented musician, with some bass lines that sink into the listeners skull, and never leave. The bass is audible throughout, which is rare for a metal artist, but to have mixed out talent like this would be criminal.\n\nThis stands out as one of the primary reasons why Death will always be number one in the death metal scene, having first created it, then refined it with Leprosy and Spiritual Healing, and then revolutionized it with Human, before leaving the genres defining moment with Symbolic and Individual Thought Patterns. Human is a timeless album that will have as much relevancy and staying power in another fifty years as it had upon its initial release.\n",
        "\nThe final chapter in Death's story was a fitting closure to the discography. All of the elements from each album had been stacking up, and every album had brought something completely new and fresh to the table. Scream Bloody Gore had the bludgeoning speed, Leprosy had the refined feel, Spiritual Healing brought the more polished production, Human had the aggression, Individual Thought Patterns brought the more insightful side of Death's lyrics, and Symbolic perfected the progressive nature. By the time of The Sound Of Perseverance, Death metal was a very different band. They had shed their days of brutal death metal, and replaced it with a Progressive styling of death metal, in which Chuck shrieks his lungs out instead of the growl he had on the early releases. And, by some divine miracle, Death still had an incredible amount of integrity to their music.\n\nTheir final release contained 8 original songs and a cover, each of which contains that signature sound that only Death could invoke. Starting with the cover, Painkiller was originally a Judas Priest classic, that Chuck decided to cover, and it is done flawlessly. Along with Crystal Mountain, this was my introduction to Death, and is a great song. The drums are very noticeable on this album, having the rattle feel to them that Saint Anger bastardized. However, on here, they are not only tolerable, but sound fantastic, and are coupled marvelously with the incredible drum patterns found throughout the album.\n\nOpener Scavenger Of Human Sorrow somehow manages to be one of the most brutally heavy, lightning fast intense songs ever recorded, despite clocking in at just under 7 minutes. This song contains some face melting guitar work, drumming that could only have been produced by the devil himself, and bass work that is nearly flawless. Chuck sounds utterly demonic on this song, and this will continue through the rest of the album. He took the high pitched styling of his growls from the previous album, Symbolic, and makes his voice even more insane, and utterly unique. This, in my opinion, is Chuck Schuldiner's finest vocal performance by quite some way. His voice drips emotion and rage, despite the fact he is clearly straining his throat to hit some of the notes found throughout this album. The most jaw dropping thing about the vocals is the fact that they still retain that defining death metal feel despite being the complete opposite of traditional death metal vocals, which is a testament to just how good Chuck was.\n\nMy personal favourite Death song ever, Flesh And The Power It Holds, is found on this album, lasting nearly 8 and a half minutes and never failing to flatten the listener. This song, along with the album, is a rare case in which it manages to give the listener something completely fresh every time. There is always something amazing that evaded the listener before, and that truly is marvelous. The stop-start solo is utterly incredible, and the blisteringly fast riffs are written so well that very few songs could ever dream of coming close to them. The lyrics for this song are extremely well written, containing moments of pure genius such as \"Passion is a poison laced with pleasure bitter sweet\". Cryptic and yet perfectly written, the lyrics to this song are some of the best found in death metal.\n\nVoice Of The Soul is the shortest song on the album, at 3:43, and serves as the perfect interlude between Flesh and The Power It Holds and To Forgive Is To Suffer, with some awesome acoustic work, emotional soloing and an atmosphere that no other death metal song would ever come within touching distance of. The mood of this song is one of utter despair, and ties in with the themes of the album absolutely perfectly. Sometimes in music, there are instrumentals that feel as though they need vocals and lyrics to tell their story. Not Voice Of The Soul, however, this song is a classic as it is, and the music speaks so much without the need of any vocal work.\n\nThe drum solo that opens To Forgive Is To Suffer is nothing short of breath taking, and the riffs that follow this have so much talent behind them that it is impossible to ignore. The vocals from Chuck found on this song are some of the best I can honestly recall hearing from any vocalist ever. Chuck manages to get so much hate behind his vocals that it does not matter what lyrics he spews out, as the point is always made. A Moment Of Clarity is the final original song off of the album, and the technical guitars at work on this song are a joy to behold. This is how metal music should be written, with a supreme amount of confidence echoing off of every note, so that the listener knows the band who have written it does not fuck around. The progression at work on this song is something completely out of this world, being utterly flawless.\n\nThe bass work is something to note throughout this album, being more than audible, and used as fills to progress the songs into their next section, such as in the opener and Flesh And The Power It Holds. Unlike some albums where the bass work is just there in the back ground, it is hard to imagine the Sound Of Perseverance without Scott Clendenin's incessant thumping throughout. The same can be said of the extremely insightful lyrics, being some of the finest out there. The lyrics on this album may well rival some of Iron Maiden's best moments, with songs such as Story To Tell, A Moment Of Clarity, Flesh And The Power It Holds and Bite The Pain painting such canvases of warped social commentary that only Chuck could create, whilst being extremely cryptic in places.\n\nThe only remote criticism that can be found of this album is the fact that the cover of Painkiller was not completely necessary. This is not to say that it is a poor cover, nor that it lets the album leave on a poor note by any means, as the actual cover is utterly stellar. It is the fact that Death did not need to record a cover, as the 8 songs they already had were jaw dropping enough as it was. However, the Painkiller cover was a homage to one of Chuck's primary influences, and was significantly different in sound from the original, and therefore this is no real down side to the album at all.\n\nThis album was the fitting swan song for Chuck, being near faultless on every single level. This is a very technical, well written piece of progressive death metal that needs no clean vocals and constant acoustic guitars to progress from segment to segment and convey simultaneous feelings of loss, hate, anger and despair all at once such as other bands in the genre. This really is one of the most amazing albums ever recorded, and really is in a class of albums that only a few others, including some of Death's own albums, can ever dream of being on the same level as.\n",
        "\nDeath's story is some of the most interesting reading/listening that one can persevere in. Throughout a 15 year career they created and repeatedly revolutionized a genre with each installment getting more and more progressive and insightful, culminating in the masterpiece that Symbolic was and eventually ending with the tragic demise of Chuck Schuldiner-the heart and soul of Death. Whilst active Death unleashed seven albums of death metal goodness that is near unrivalled. Scream Bloody Gore created the genre, and Leprosy refined it before Spiritual Healing marked the first deviation from the path of death metal in its purest form with some more progressive song structures and lyrics that moved into more tabboo subjects such as abortion as opposed to sacrificial rituals and human illnesses. From 1991's Human onwards their catalogue is nearly flawless with that particular album being a thirty minute long maelstrom of riffs and each album adding more and more to this template. Whilst each of these is close to perfection it is debated which one is the weakest of the lot with Individual Thought Patterns being the album most often named from Death's final four. Whilst this may well be true, this should not be taken as any manner of insult as what this album is is something quite special.\n\nIndividual Thought Patterns is the fifth album in Death's discography, released two years after Human and containing ten songs with an average length of about four minutes per song, clocking in at forty eight minutes. To think that one year prior to this the Fate greatest hits collection had been released and then this was released, destroying eighty percent of that compilation effortlessly. Chuck Schuldiner was right to disapprove of the song selection on there, as Sony were proven wrong in placing songs such as the title track to Spiritual Healing on there, no matter how good that song was, when this was right around the corner. This was the album that featured Destiny with its fantastic incessant riff-work and that killer slow section following the solo and accompanying fast riff. This was also the album to feature hit song The Philosopher, one of the band's best known due to Beavis and Butthead mocking Chucks vocals and the accompanying video for this song. No matter what way you look at it, back to front Individual Thought Patterns was destined to be a classic.\n\nThis is Death's most progressive album to date and yet still managed to keep the song time down. Throughout each one of these songs there are enough lightning fast changes in speed to make this an epileptic's worse nightmare. Imagine taking the heaviness and balls out speed of Scream Bloody Gore and interweaving the genius twists of an album such as 2112 by Rush and what you have is Individual Thought Patterns. Neither of those albums realistically have too much in common with this release but to combine the stylistic approaches is to find the formula that makes this album work so well. Out Of Touch is a great example of how progressively-oriented this album is and yet is also a good means to point out how Chuck never forgot rule number 1 of death metal-make it heavy as hell. The song opens up with a nice little drum roll from none other than new band member Gene Hoglan of Dark Angel fame, and moves through a slow, jazz-influenced section before at forty seconds it leaps into balls-to-the-wall speed mode. Then, just after the minute mark, the song slows right back down and we have some heavy palm muted riffing from Chuck with Steve DiGiorgio's bass thumping away in the background. At 1:57 a thrashy riff comes in whilst Chuck throws his soul into his vocals and then in comes a highly technical solo that is cleverly worked around the dynamic musicianship that never seems to stop changing. At 3:10 one might think the song was about to end with some clever lead noodling before suddenly we are kicked in the face again by a fast as hell tremolo riff and the song then continues to dance around with speeds until the thrilling end where we are given one chord to end it all. On this song Death managed to work in more musical ideas and changes in direction in the space of four and a half minutes than many bands can accomplish in entire albums, such is testament as to how talented Chuck really was-the man was a visionary, nothing more and nothing less.\n\nThe drumming on this album is nothing short of incredible. There are near-constant debates as to whether Sean Reinert's machine gun sounding drums on Human, as evidenced by the introduction to Flattening Of Emotions, are better or whether Gene Hoglan's relentless work is better and the truth is neither of them are better than the other. Both put in thrilling performances with highly technical drum beats and fills thrown in left right and centre, with Sean's performance on Human being a little more contained than Gene's flashy drumming on this album. Mentally Blind shows off his ability to let loose with double bass drumming better than almost any drummer out there but he is not afraid to mix his performance up a bit as is found in The Philosipher. All the way through this album there are constant speed changes that never fail to drop the listener's jaw right to the ground. Gene Hoglan gets the job done on this album with emphatic style. Holding up the other end of the rhythm section is Steve Digiorgio with his fretless bass guitar whose instrument does not, for once, go unheard as the production job is handled masterfully by Scott Burns. He also puts on a great show, with his bass lines usually following the guitars for the most part but this is as expected with metal and it is just nice to be able to hear the work of a bassist for once.\n\nThe guitar work has always been the centrepiece of any Death release and on Individual Thought Patterns this is shown off constantly. From the tapping intro to The Philosopher to the crushing riffs of the album's shortest song, Nothing Is Everything, back to The Philosopher's stop-start riff, this is as varied an album as a pair of guitarists could hope to concieve. Andy LaRocque and Chuck Schuldiner handle the guitars on this album and both are as talented as each other with each guitarist having numerous solos and fills on the album from Andy's incredible work on In Human Form to Chuck's aforementioned shining moment during the intro to The Philosopher. The riffs have a huge amount of contrast to them as the songs consistently jump from fast tremolo picking to more deliberate, slower paced riffs and each one never fails to shred your face off. This is one album where the guitar work is completely flawless from the opening moment right through to a thrilling conclusion. Chuck also handles the vocals on here, as with every Death album, and his performance is something to be proud of. His voice was fast ascending in pitch by this point, which would later culminate in the manic shrieking found on The Sound Of Perseverance, but this is the last traces of the low tones that populated earlier Death albums. His lyricism on this album is something really rather special. Chuck had just as much talent with a pen as he did with a guitar, continuing the journey through his mind and his thoughts on various topics that began on Spiritual Healing. Chuck was a philosopher, through and through, as is evidenced by the lyrics to songs such as Mentally Blind and Trapped In A Corner. The lyrics are just the icing on an already perfect cake.\n\nThis album is as close to perfection as can be found and paved the way for something even greater that came about with the very next album, Symbolic. The only minute criticism that can realistically be found with this album is that it does not have enough truly catchy moments to it, instead shifting up so many styles in the blink of an eye that there is little to truly latch onto. It will take many a number of listens for moments to stick in your head from this album as opposed to Human which instantly hooked you in. In many ways this built upon Human but that album was just such a whirlwind and still pulled you in within mere minutes that Human slightly tops this. However, Individual Thought Patterns is brilliance incarnate that no death metal fan should go witho\n",
        "\nThe vocals, rhythms, lyrics, leads, and production are all solid on this release. It falls more on the death metal genre not progressive even though Chuck said that Death would always be a growing band. That they were, but during this era death metal was pretty much invented by the man. Death's first 3 albums are their heaviest. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and \"Leprosy\" were more brutal, but the production quality wasn't as good. \"Spiritual Healing\" is definitely a vintage album way ahead of it's time.\n\nI'd say that even though a lot of the guitar construction was really basic with chords thick featuring heavy distortion, Chuck created riffs that were tremolo picked, chords fitting the vocals as well as their content, and solos by the man plus James Murphy in the lead department also brilliantly executes his efforts. The lyrical content was more thought out than the first 2 Death albums. But \"Leprosy\" has some good songs with really memorable lyrics especially for the song \"Pull the Plug\".\n\nChuck was still developing on his leads while James Murphy was more melodic during his featuring tremolo picking galore, sweeps amazingly played out, and arpeggios fluent entirely. I think that it was a wise move to have this album remastered to really get the most out of it and recognizing that way back in 1990, the production quality wasn't as good obviously plus Death was still getting established with their sound just different lineups with each succeeding record.\n\nChuck worked with some really amazing guitar players and James Murphy here on \"Spiritual Healing\" is an example of a man that was wicked in the lead department. He also suffers with brain cancer like Chuck and that is why there is Sweet Relief Foundation for musicians that are without medical insurance. Back on the topic of \"Spiritual Healing\" as an album, Chuck had really deep throat which fit the guitar chords and progressions quite well. A lot of people feel that this is Death's best release ever. To me \"Human\" is, but it's still debatable.\n\nWay ahead of his time, Chuck started focusing heavily on lyrics that make people think like say \"I've never thought of this, or you know, maybe he's right about this\" as being an open topic to words that are well thought out. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" didn't have that mentality because Chuck was still trying to develop as a musician. I think that he really hit top notch on this album. The riffs are so well constructed and Death's sound was getting more and more recognized by the death metal community.\n\nBands like Deicide, Obituary, et al did not have lyrics nearly as good as on \"Spiritual Healing\" or the next succeeding albums. Deicide of course had such nonsense with Satanic words which are not hard to write about. \"Spiritual Healing\" I'd say crushed Deicide's debut because the rhythms, leads, vocals, and overall musicianship was not lacking at all because of Chuck's genius. He really wanted death metal to feature music and lyrics that take time to construct and be become unforgettable.\n\n\"Living Monsrosity\" is probably my favorite track on the whole album but all of the songs are noteworthy and amazingly well put together. There are many instances of melodic riffs alongside the thick chord progressions. Tempos always changing, scales/finger tapping as a part of a lot of songs with the deep throat Chuck used which fit so well with the music. Lead trade offs by Chuck and James were also a highlight. James focused on more melodic leads while Chuck initiated more faster tremolo picking whizzing through the fretboard.\n\nIf you are a death metal fan, do not leave \"Spiritual Healing\" out of your collection. It simply is a genius like release that features originality, great musicianship by all band members, and an overall kick ass album musically, lyrically, and technically. Such a great band that was way ahead of its time as I've said previously and Chuck explored many avenues in the songwriting plus the lyrical content. This is when Death I think was founded because it had so many variations plus totally brutal throat which I think fit the music the most.\n",
        "\nContinuing their worthy foray into the seminal Death discography, the next re-release on the Relapse chopping block is their third LP, 1990's \"Spiritual Healing\". We can of course look back with hindsight and comment that this release continued where \"Leprosy\" left off, taking the more developed song structures, riffing patterns and let's not forget, socially aware lyrical themes, moving the band further into the progressive territories which were later enhanced on \"Human\" and beyond. Sandwiched in between in my opinion two of the most masterful death metal releases in history, \"Spiritual Healing\" has never gotten over being the ugly duckling of this period in Death's history; it does not totally master their incisiveness throughout but with this re-working is still a highly recommended feature of the Death cannon.\n\nThe re-mastered production has greatly enhanced the clarity of the record, showing how the likes of \"Defensive Personalities\" and \"Altering the Future\" revel more in the slow(er) leaden-weight heaviness of \"Leprosy\" material rather than the Gene Hoglan backed speed of \"Human\". Take the title track, \"Genetic Reconstruction\" or \"Low Life\" as examples of Chuck Schuldiner & co allowing the songs to start off in slow clinical fashion before picking up the speed later on with a catalogue of riffs building towards the hammering choruses - even at 22 years old these songs still pack in much more than the average DM band of today.\n\nThe song titles quoted so far, not to mention the thought-provoking cover, should also prick the ears of anyone tired of the stereotypical Satanic or gory lyrics of extreme metal; more than a writer of great songs, Schuldiner displayed a strong knack at this early stage of Death's career to pen thoughtful social lyrics. How about \"The guilty one, innocent she now cries / A life of hell, better off to die / Born without eyes, hands, and a half a brain / Being born addicted to cocaine\" from \"Living Monstrosity\" or \"Replacing what is real by using technology / Population control, selecting those who will breed / A specific type of form chosen for the unborn\" from \"Genetic Reconstruction\". Stuff that to anyone claiming a faux love of Satan or winging about their ex-girlfriend.\n\nAs an addition to the original release we here also have a bonus disc comprising 16 tracks of rehearsals and demo versions of the tracks that ended up on the album. Naturally these are more for the die-hard Death fan but as usual offer an interesting insight into the work that goes into writing such songs before a reliance on studio gimmickry and computerised guitar and drum sounds became the norm.\n\nAs my numero uno band of all time I would of course exhort any metal fan to investigate all seven Death full-lengths so it comes as no surprise that I would do so for \"Spiritual Healing\". As an exercise in intelligent death metal it is magnificent - that still it lurks in their shadows of the two releases either side is testimony to Death's unsurpassed status as the kings of death metal. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nFor many, the embryonic traces of death metal are those of Slayer. Some say that Celtic Frost, or even Venom and Possessed are credited with the conception of death metal. While this may be true, and in many ways subjective, the somewhat obvious answer is Death, and by extension this very demo. Released in 1984, this demo is sheer death metal brutality. To imagine what the response of those who came into contact with this first back in 1984, and era ruled by hairspray and spandex, is one I truly wish I could have seen. To add to the brilliance, it was only two people who orchestrated this demo to be what is. Mr. Kam Lee, and the legendary Chuck Shuldiner [R.I.P.]. From start to finish, this demo births the earliest incarnations of death metal, and the future seeds of what would be. \n\nThere are only 4 tracks, or be it five I believe on some copies. From the get-go, the tone of this demo is just pure evil. To even think this was released in 1984 is sincerely mind blowing. Just as the L.A. scene was picking up speed thanks to the likes of Motley Crue, Poison and Ratt, the death metal scene was quite literally in it's infancy. Most of the bands had not even gone to Florida yet, the place where death metal would soon be the mecca of, and the place where bands flooded its market to near full capacity. To many this may sound completely subjective, and it very well may be, but this demo is unadulterated death metal at it's purest form. Take a track like \"Corpsegrinder\", which is full on tremolo picking and early death growls in it's possible first appearance. Kam Lee does an incredible job on vocals on this demo. His sound may not encompass what most have come to understand is a death growl, but more a bark or even a bellow. In many respects, they were just taking what Slayer had done on guitar and drums, and mixing it with a warped version of what Celtic Frost and Venom were doing at the time on vocals. Possessed were definitely an influence on Death, more specifically in their earliest years. However, Death had a more \"death like\" sound on this demo, and that is why I say Death were the first band in existence to play true death metal. This demo's full of all the attributes, and laid the ground work for many other bands to come. \n\nIn all, this demo must have scared some people when it first came out. Blatantly evil and inherently dark, this demo launched the growth of death metal into a new stratosphere. As time has gone on, people have accepted Death as the godfathers of death metal, and the gods of what is now beloved by many. Yes the production is bad. Yes the instruments sounds like tin. And yes most of the lyrics are immature. But think about it, without this demo, our beloved death metal would never exist. So to for that, say a big thank you to Death, and grind a corpse in their honor.\n",
        "\nI decided to get the remastered version of this album because the bass guitar was hard to hear on the original recording of this release. I would consider Human to be Death\u2019s best album ever. There are so many reasons for this claim. Not only is the music wholly original in it\u2019s entirety, but the lyrics also pose so much thought that Chuck put into the words. It isn\u2019t brutal lyrics for the sake of being brutal. It has a lot of thought that some people would especially ponder and say \u201chmmm, I\u2019ve never thought about this before\u201d or \u201cmaybe it\u2019s something that I agree with\u201d.\n\nThe music is entirely original on every song. When I say original, I mean that the riffs display sounds that no other band has produced ever before. Chuck was a self taught musician and his writing style progressed over the years and on Human he constructed mind blowing overtures with songs like \u201cLack of Comprehension\u201d or which later became a video. Yes the music and the vocals were brutal even though the song itself started off with a clean piece, it progressed into a totally hateful death metal output emphasizing music and lyrics Chuck had amassed during the early days when he seemed to be plagued by people that befriended him.\n\nI love the riffs on every some because they\u2019re so diverse and the music always goes along with the vocals. There displays outputs of guitar frenzies featuring tremolo picked guitar efforts alongside chord progressions that are simply mind boggling. The remastered version features a cover of Kiss\u2019s \u201cGod of Thunder\u201d, which they do an awesome display of Chuck\u2019s earlier influences and makes into a solid death metal output. I absolutely love the remastered version of this album not only because is the bass better to hear, but the music in general is hear altogether in unison.\n\nSongs like \u201cSecret Face\u201d are lyrically mind blowing with music put together like no other music is done. You can compare that to all of the songs on this album. I think that \u201cVacant Planets\u201d is my short, but favorite track especially because of the guitars featuring tapping techniques that only the mastermind of metal Chuck could construct. The whole song is aggressive and totally melodic. I\u2019d conclude that the whole album is progressive and melodic. You can\u2019t find a better death metal album that tops Human. It simply goes down to me one of the best death metal releases of our time.\n\nIf you\u2019re a Death fan and are lacking this album, you\u2019re missing out on a plethora of tracks that will blow your mind. The music is the highlight of the release and no other death metal album that I\u2019ve heard can compete with this one. The music, solos, vocals, drums and lyrics all fit together to make one hell of a monumental metal release that can never be duplicated. Chuck was an amazing musician who died too young. His music will live on as a legacy in the death metal world. We all hope that he is at peace now and onto the next life. Own this remastered version today and you\u2019ll hear what I\u2019m trying to convey in this review!\n",
        "\nWhile their are divisions among fans of Death as to which period of Death they like, I am one of those who loves all Death albums and is able to appreciate each one for their different sound. This album seems to focus less on the technical aspects of albums such as Human and Individual Thought Patterns and focuses more on the melody as was the direction on Symbolic. Now onto what makes this album so excellent.\n\nFirstly there are no filler songs on this album to be found. Starting with Scavenger of Human Sorrow and ending with an excellent cover of Painkiller, this album is yet another masterpiece album in the Death discography and unfortunately the last. The cover of Painkiller also features what I would call the most amazing scream of all time, the vocals sound a little forced but overall epic. This album is melodic featuring many great riffs, amazing drumming and some great sounding bass lines. \n\nThe drums are a major standout point on this album. On drums is Richard Christy giving one of the best drum performances on an album in metal history. He plays with style and effectively makes every second of every song tasteful yet technical. I really love how he does the drums in Scavenger of Human Sorrow. \n\nNow for the vocals, the vocals are very high pitched and almost sounds like Schuldiner is straining himself to make this last Death album as if he knew what would happen in a few years. While I personally prefer his vocals on Spiritual Healing to Individual Thought Patterns, these vocals fit right in with the rest of the music.\n\nAs for the bass, well its audible and manages to add a lot to the music, especially on Spirit Crusher. And me as a bass player, I like it when I can hear the bass very well. Another thing to love about the bass is that it doesn't just follow the guitar or have a very simple beat like the majority of what is put out the radio, it manages to have its own identity while following the guitar at times when it would flow best.\n\nThe only downside to this album is that the guitar solos seem to be lacking but overall, all the songs are beautiful. However, I just feel like the solos could have had some more effort put into them. I don't know what it is that makes me feel this, but I can remember all the riffs on this album but hardly any of the solos. \n\nThis album in a way has deep emotion put into it, especially in the lyrics as well as the instrumental Voice of the Soul. This instrumental makes use of two electric guitars and an acoustic which is kind of used like the drums on this song. It evokes a sense of beauty and makes you miss Chuck when you hear it.\n\nWhile not my favorite Death album, I still consider this to be a masterpiece and a great last breath of life for Death (no pun intended).\n\nStandout tracks: Scavenger of Human Sorrow, Spirit Crusher, Voice of the Soul, Moment of Clarity\n",
        "\nHere you have it - Death's last (and worst) album. Evil Chuck finally got rid of the little mask thing on top of the H on the logo, and in time, he would have probably gotten rid of the scythe as well if it managed to give him some bits of the artistic credibility he oh so craved. The amount of songwriting not present here is staggering; it's actually amazing they managed to record, produce, mix, master and release an entire album without writing any songs at all. Random changes in pace that have nothing to do with what was happening before, a now complete, total and absolute lack of good riffs, Evil Chuck doing a Dani Filth impersonation all the way through, and some of the worst shredding you'll ever have the misfortune to hear in your life are merely elements of the terribleness present in this album. At this point Death don't have a single trace of death metal in them anymore, so this is pretty much a full-blown extreme progressive metal album. Sounds bad? You haven't even begun to listen to The Sound of Perseverance. \n\nPerformance-wise, it's the usual Death. Basically, (mostly) everyone gives off a nice performance on their own, which turns into a wreck once everything is added together. The drumming, for one, is such a poor show of groove and restraint that it sadly manages to subtract more from the songs than actually add to them. There's no Hoglan here anymore, so what we get instead is some guy accentuating every nanosecond with every single cymbal on his kit, which I guess is technically impressive, but doesn't do anything to improve the songs. I feels like a drummer trying to play the jazziest beats ever because he would get bored otherwise, but in the end, they feel completely disconnected from the rest of the instruments. In short, it's bad progressive metal drumming. Instead of giving a feel of connection between the rhythmic and melodic elements, the drummer opts to rather show off how many cymbals can be played in the shortest possible time-span. I'm not completely sure if it's Richard Christy's fault for his lack of taste, or if Schuldiner asked him to be as loose as possible in his delivery. The only thing I've heard featuring him is that Control Denied album, but then again it also featured Chuck's songwriting; I'll throw a wild guess and simply blame them both for the mess present here. \n\nSteve DiGiorgio left/was fired before this album was recorded, so he's not present here either. Not that he's missed, since he was mostly relegated to follow the guitars around on the preceding albums. Seriously, you would have expected Chuck to use such a good bass player in a more respectful way. Here, the bass takes on a more active role. It also has a very nice, warm sound. You can hear it thumping under the guitars at times, and it really shines on the quieter parts. However, those parts usually suck more than anything. Those middle sections of \"Flesh and the Power it Holds\" and \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" are complete snooze fests, and not only do they both manage to appear and go away randomly and out of thin air, masquerading their go as progression, but they contain the most extensive use of bass in the entire album just to be drowned out by Chuck's shitty, shitty soloing. What was he playing those with, a coin?\n\nAnd that brings us to the guitars themselves. I'm not even going to try to make a case for the riffs, as they are a non-entity. However, if you want to know how they sound like, just picture a bunch of bland thrash/melodeath riffs with lots of sugar thrown in them, and some chugging thrown in for good measure. Let's focus on the shredding instead. It is easily and by far the worst soloing on any Death album, and it isn't even because of a lack of melodic skill, but because of a lack of pure restraint. Case in point, \"Voice of the Soul\" is an actually amazing track. It's the best later-era Death song ever because it isn't Chuck and company betting to see who plays the fastest, most pompous solo (and in his case, he always lost because he was sloppy as if he were playing with a piece of cardboard). That song works because it carries a principle of \"just write a damn song and don't get too cute with it\". Also, it doesn't feature vocals, but more on that later. I don't know of Shannon Hamm's work beyond what he did on Control Denied, but that album is probably not the best way to judge any musician present in it. He plays some actually decent leads every so and so while Chuck botches his and succeeds in giving his sloppiest guitar performance ever, and with a career like his, that's saying a lot. \n\nThe biggest problem, performance-wise, with The Sound of Perseverance is the vocals. Chuck's silly growls have always been Death's weakest point, but here he just plain out stopped giving a damn. As said earlier, it sounds like he was trying to do a Dani Filth impersonation, with a very annoying high pitched growl that sounds as threatening as, well, Dani Filth. It's a huge step down, because whereas the vocals on other Death albums are uneventful at best and just flat out boring at worst, these are downright obnoxious to listen to. Chuck maintains his \"do everything with exactly the same-sounding screech\" approach that he has always used, but this time said screech just feels like ear rape. At some points, he'll actually do this weird clean-sounding rasp, but that ends up sounding more like bad melodeath vocals than anything. At least he learned his lesson and actually hired a singer for his Control Denied album -- which is the obvious thing anyone would've done when wanting to write a pure progressive metal album. Also, his \"sss\" hisses sound horrible. \"Dreamssss ssssiiight eyeesss sss sssss sssnaakeesss\" goddammit Chuck you were not a reptile, you were a human being, you didn't even have scales.\n\nThis is all, of course, completely irrelevant once you point out the actual flaw in the album, which is the songwriting. It's obviously bad, since we know who was in charge of it, but whereas other Death albums showed elements of good songwriting deeply hidden down a sea of shit/nonexistent songwriting, The Sound of Perseverance's approach to this delicate, vital and essential part of making music is to pretty much not do it at all. You know how death metal is supposed to have a sense of chaos? Of dark, morbid riffs that hit you in the head without mercy, but that at the same time manage to find an order within? This tries to do the opposite of that. Instead of ending up with a bunch of songs whose inherent chaos gives you no chance to escape, there are a bunch of verses, choruses, solos, silly fusion sections and a myriad of other things just thrown into a blender and arbitrarily arranged. You could cut them up, paste them into other songs, trade them around, delete them, and nobody would notice the difference. There are awkward silences between sections, proving that their transitions weren't thought of at all, so a section will end abruptly to mark the start of another section that has nothing to do with either the one before, or the one after it. It doesn't sound chaotic, it simply sounds random; like a kid just writing his first song and tabbing it out in guitar pro. \n\nThere is one instance of good songwriting here, and that would be \"Painkiller\" (har har). Obviously, Evil Chuck completely mangled and butchered it and turned it into what I still believe is the worst cover ever. Those videos on YouTube of high school bands full of kids covering \"The Final Countdown\" and \"Sweet Child O'Mine\" provide a better listening experience, and in general are more faithful to the spirit of the song. Chuck sounds like an impersonation of Dani Filth doing a Rob Halford imitation. This is made worse by the fact the vocals are laughably louder than the guitars, which do useless harmonizations of the original riffs which didn't need to be harmonized in the first place. Then Chuck comes in with the main solo to completely ruin the original, doing some very sloppy sweep picking exercises in the beginning, and then turning it into a melodeath section that makes no sense at all within the context of the song. \"Thisss isss daah Painkillaahh\" No, Chuck, you're causing me pain, not killing it. Please stop it, it's mean. You are not Rob Halford. You are not Glenn Tipton. You're not even Ian Hill. Why do you do this.\n\nSummarizing, The Sound of Perseverance is a horrible album. It's shit, and you're better off listening to \"Voice of the Soul\" on YouTube or something. Death fell so hard into the concrete below they managed to crack it, keep falling, and then continue all the way into earth's mantle -- all while sustaining horrible internal injuries. It's prog for the sake of being prog, it has terrible vocals, terrible shredding, terrible riffs, and I still have no idea what the cover art is supposed to be, but it's really ugly. Gladly, as far as I know, not many bands have gone ahead and started playing in this style consistently, so at least it stands on its own haven of awfulness. It is to be avoided.\n",
        "\n... A step up!? In every single aspect from the last one! Symbolic is surprising like that. I still wouldn't call it a good album, but most of the particularly obnoxious elements that plagued Death's 1993 release aren't present here. In short, while Evil Chuck kept his former levels of Buttcephaly intact, he managed to at least focus them on better songwriting methods, which in turn ended up creating a less technical, more accessible album. Taking Death's later career into account, this is actually a good thing - an improvement. Not to say the album is without flaws, but at the very least, it's less pretentious and self-centered than its two predecessors. In fact, aside from Gene Hoglan's drumming, the album isn't very progressive or technical in the least bit, especially when comparing it to its contemporaries. Instead of prog death, I would call it pop death instead, as comparisons to works such as Heartwork wouldn't look too out of place when referring to it. It's completely inoffensive in every possible way. In any case, there are a couple of strong individual moments during some songs, and one or two actually really entirely enjoyable compositions. The production job is Death's best, as it is clear but doesn't have an overall sterile sound. However, in the end there are still a number of issues with it, which come into conflict with the album becoming a pleasant experience all the way through.\n\nLet us start with the guitar work! The guitar tone is the best of Death's later era, as it is crunchy yet not too thin, and thankfully not the scooped mess that was Human's. But how does the tone match up to the riffs? Not very well, really. This is later era Death, and therefore Chuck was still too busy talking about his personal cosmological views instead of writing crushing riffs, so there are way more power chords and melodies than actual riffage all through the album. They're not bad per se, but what they give you in the end is closer to pedestrian melodic death metal than anything else. I know what I hate, and I don't hate this - but I don't like it either. The guitar work resembles a death metal/rock weird type of hybrid at times, which is one of the reasons it's so accessible in the first place. Once again, it's not something that could be called bad, but it's neither the technical masterpiece that some fans claim it is, nor a particularly exciting rockin' performance. \n\nThe average track length in Symbolic is around five and a half minutes. This is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it allows individual ideas to develop and build-up the momentum of the compositions instead of just starting and stopping abruptly like they did on Individual Thought Patterns. At the same time, it means bad ideas get to stick around for a longer time, and it also means Schuldiner's hit-to-miss ratio became lower. It also means that, up to this point in time, it's the longest Death album, so you have to listen to Death for a longer time - and that is just mean! It also contains that horrible \"Perennial Quest\" song at the end, which is just an agglomeration of overlong ideas that just meander on and on and never really go anywhere. Anyhow, the overall songwriting prowess is indeed superior to the '91 and '93 albums, because it's simpler and more restrained. The opening seconds of the title track are some of Death's most entertaining material, in my opinion. But then the song devolves into a myriad of bad riffs and ideas that don't really work together, just to come back for a genuinely enjoyable solo in the middle. That's kind of the deal with Symbolic; it teases you, like a woman making advances on you for the sake of feeling desired, yet she would never leave her significant other for you. Its songs are full of good moments that make you believe everything will turn out okay in the end, but it doesn't - what a hussy.\n\nThe strongest points on the album, performance wise, are the guitar solos and the drumming. Gene Hoglan sounds amazing here, both in his playing and in his general sound. The drums sound big and powerful, and gone is that plastic snare that he used on Individual Thought Patterns, so he's actually the best thing in here! The leads are good, albeit a complete cheese-fest. I have no idea who Billy Koelble is, but he's a fantastic shredder, going for a very over the top style instead of the more restrained jazzy soloing of earlier Chuck guitarists. Evil Chuck himself actually plays a couple of cool leads here and there, when he goes for slow melodies instead of shred, which he's pretty decent at. In spite of that, most of the riffs under the solos are extremely weak, usually opting for single power chord sections to give them a spacey feeling, but that just ends up sounding lazy and under-cooked, if you will. It's a funny thing with this album, I like to jam to it, to play riffs and solos off it, but I don't take pleasure in listening to most of them. All of these later-era Death solos make me think they would've been much better off had they just stuck with Rick Rozz all the way through and let him dive bomb and do weedly diddly doos all over the place; those are pretty fun to listen to, though not as fun to jam to. \n\nNevertheless, even with all of these shortcomings, there are still some tracks that I like almost all the way through! \"1000 Eyes\" has that nice guitar melody under the chorus, even if the 'riffing' under it is just a held out chord, that little part alone is pretty memorable by itself at least, and there are a bunch of small tapping sections all over the place that are also nice. That one's followed by \"Without Judgement\" that has that awesome riff at 1:12 which is followed by an echoey lead on top, and then the riffset after that is simply straight out good; even the stupid space rock silliness that follows the solo can be forgiven on those two minutes alone. The trifecta is completed by \"Crystal Mountain\" which is a catchy pop rock song with a bunch of memorable leads that are closer to power metal than anything else. Hell, even Chuck's voice works over here. Yes, he's still doing the \"I'm not changing my vocal style during the duration of the album even though I can clearly do so between albums!\" shtick he likes to do so much when singing, but it's easily his best vocal performance on the later-era albums. It's just a small high pitched growl, but it works for most of the album, even if there's absolutely no variation to it. He's tolerable, and that's about it.\n\nSymbolic is not a great album. It's not a good album either. It's a decent album that is, quite simply, not enjoyable in the end. That's probably the best way I can describe it; decent, yet not satisfying. It's completely inoffensive, and not bad enough to require a very aggressive emotional response. At best, it's a harmless melodic death metal album. At worst, it's merely forgettable, instead of all-out annoying. To continue with my 'falling down' Death metaphors, if Individual Thought Patterns was a cascade-like vertical fall towards infinity, Symbolic fell over a small futuristic elevator going up before it could reach top speed, which kept it alive, if with internal injuries, and slowly moved it upwards. However, Death were too hurt by this point, and in their squirming, they moved towards the edge of said elevator. Dangerously close to the edge. After that, it would not be a happy ending for anyone involved.\n",
        "\nRecorded at some point during 1992, Individual Thought Patterns marked yet another shift in Death's already withered musical direction. This time around, Evil Chuck decided to hire the best musicians he could find, have them play around with free jazz, and then just stop bothering with writing those pesky riff things. To compensate for this horrible fault, he decided to play what was left of them with an annoyingly thin guitar tone, and then just ask Steve DiGiorgio to follow around whatever he played on the bass. Then have Gene Hoglan patch up the resulting awkward mess as best as he could, and Andy LaRocque sometimes comes in for a nice solo. As you can see, these are not small-time names. All of these musicians were very good at their respective instruments, and for the most part played in very good bands, which had, at this point, already released a bunch of very good albums. Nevertheless, as is the case with Death, one only has to look at the \"Composed by...\" lines on the booklet to understand why none of this matters in the end. Because, after releasing Human, Chuck was suffering from such a severe case of Buttcephaly (cephalic comes from head, butt comes from butt, as in, having one's head so far up one's own butt that one starts suffering from oxygen deprivation) that little could be done to put reason into the man. This is what followed.\n\nThe main problem with this album (that is, one of many problems), lies in the songwriting. I'm not even sure if Schuldiner just didn't write all the music as a way to vent his lyrics about how everyone's dumb, but he certainly didn't write riffs to match them. Everything is overly technical for no apparent reason besides, well, being technical. The consequence is that the songs don't feel like songs, but as random bursts of riffs and leads that start playing for no reason and stop for even less of a reason. A complex piece will start playing for a couple of seconds, and then be completely forgotten in time. This leaves the songs, which are already fortunately quite short in length, with very little room for build-up. This wouldn't be so much of a problem, and would even feel exciting in an anxious sort of way if the riffs were any good - they aren't. In fact, most of the time, the backing riffs behind the solos are better than the solos which compose the building blocks of the songs, which leaves you with strong lead sections that just fail to go anywhere inside of the actual song. I know Andy's talented - I compulsively sing songs off Abigail out loud all the time, especially in the shower and during lectures - so I don't need him to remind me that he can shred every ten seconds if it's not going to have any meaning within the context of the composition. The entire album is like that.\n\nTo keep on with the subject of the performances, there's the rhythm section by Hoglan and DiGiorgio. Gene Hoglan is, once again, a superb drummer; but whereas his performance with say, Dark Angel was relentless and vicious, here he opted to go for a jazzier style, which feels over-done and anti-climatic. He's definitely better at complementing the songs than Sean Reinert, and it works for the jazzy feeling that the compositions try to achieve, but it doesn't evoke any kind of emotional response at all. It's just him haphazardly changing beats on that horribly sounding kit with that tiny little snare sound which seriously sounds like it's made of plastic instead of... whatever it is snares are usually made from (not plastic!). DiGiorgio's basslines usually follow the guitars around, which is a shame, as he could have easily played anything aside from that and keep them more active. He will play something different at times when both guitars are harmonizing, or do little melodies on its own as is the case of the background during the title track, but without any solid guitar work for them to cling to, they're lost as nothing more than a way to say \"Bass over here! Getcha bass right here!\". The bass tone also lacks a bit of depth, but that's completely irrelevant at this point.\n\nAnd then, we have the free jazz-influenced sections. I could describe them as terrible, but that would be to imply that I consider them as sections in the first place. They come and go - there will be a riff playing while Chuck tells us about how he doesn't understand human emotions, and then everything will cut off to couple of sections where the guitars harmonize between each other and the bass does a spaced out lick in the background as the drums accentuate with jazzy cymbal accents, and then everything awkwardly comes to a halt, and back we go to stories about how much Evil Chuck hates gore in his lyrics. I don't think they count as solo or lead sections. They're not riff sections either. They're not really sections at all, if we're feeling truthful. They're what happens when you master an album wrong and end up pasting pieces of different, completely unrelated jazz fusion albums of the period at inconsistent intervals. It doesn't sound good. Then again that wouldn't surprise me, given how plastic the production sounds. Plastic, like Gene Hoglan's snare sound, but it's a sound that plagues the entire album - it gives it a very synthetic feel, which I guess ends up working well with the synthetic delivery.\n\nFinally, as the final nail in the coffin, Schuldiner's vocals. He goes for a more throaty approach than what he did on Human, but the execution is just a stale as it was there. He pronounces everything in the same tone, with the same modulation, at exactly the same volume. All in all it makes for a very boring delivery, as it is the equivalent of a clean vocalist singing everything in the same note, as he follows the same rhythm the riffs are playing. Because otherwise they would be harder to play live! His vocals definitely aren't as bad here as they would be on the next two albums, but that doesn't really make me think better of them in any case. If lyrics about goat fucking and Satan's penis will make for a more exciting vocal performance, I'll take those any day over Evil Chuck monotonously ranting about how everyone thinks they're smart but they're not, and also a plethora of other things that I don't really care about. Ghouls attacking a church to crush the holy priest seems like an infinitely more fun activity to do, anyway.\n\nThere you have it: If Spiritual Healing was a mere bump on the road and Human a figurative fall forward, Individual Thought Patterns is the beginning of the vertical cascade-like drop that followed. They hadn't quite reached terminal downwards velocity yet, but the moment would come soon enough.\n",
        "\nLooking back now, I never was a fan of Death. I wasn't back when I was twelve and just beginning to get into extreme metal; and a sudden realization, a change if heart if you will, caused by Lord Godschuldiner coming down from heaven to open my eyes towards the greatness of his works, hasn't happened yet. Therefore, I could never understand how everyone around me seemed to call this album the pinnacle of human art. I felt left out and confused, like a single guy watching a chick flick film. However, now I know I was looking for something that was never there in the first place - in the case of the chick flick viewer, a loving female companion - and in this case, enjoyable death metal. Not to say this is the worst album by Chuck and company, as it is easily the strongest out of the ones that would follow immediately afterwards, but with a late career like his, that isn't saying much.\n\nDeath's earlier albums weren't any bad; maybe a bit boring for my taste at times, but they were undeniably death metal, and without the pretentious jazzy and progressive elements that began to be pumped into their sound from this album and on. Not to say that those cannot be used correctly in a death metal context (Unquestionable Presence, anyone?), but here they sound obnoxious and out of place. The sudden line-up change between Spiritual Healing and this truly set them back a great deal, because the band ended up sacrificing creativity and essence over technicality and haphazardness. Back then, they definitely weren't as enjoyable as, say, Morbid Angel or Possessed, but one can listen to Leprosy and say \"Yep, this is death metal alright\" which doesn't happen with this one. I'm not saying Human isn't a death metal album - I'm saying it doesn't work as a death metal album. In fact, it could be said he actively began to find standard death metal as immature or \"not artistically relevant\" or some other silly Schuldinerish thing. Look at the artwork - it's not the cartoonish style of the first three, but a design that cries out \"I have deep and important things to say! Listen to them!\", which isn't a bad sentiment in itself, but calls into question whether he really wanted to keep playing death metal at all in the first place. Death didn't try to write an all-out extreme progressive metal album until years later, but this is the point where Chuck looked at albums like Altars of Madness, Realms of Chaos and hell, even Eaten Back to Life, and said, in a bored monotone, \"Meh\".\n\nFrom the annoyingly scooped guitar tone to Schuldiner's empty half-growls, Human always either falls short of delivering, or just fails to deliver completely. The riffs feel not like a guitarist's effort of writing something that matched the songs, but like a guy sitting down to write a couple of disjointed licks that he proceeded to hastily paste together either with small harmonized lead sections, or by simply leaving a nudge in the middle. The guitar playing itself is flawless, as are most of the performances, but the riffs themselves aren't. In short, this album, like all of Death's later output, sounds less like death metal and more like bad progressive metal with bad growls on top. Every so and so Chuck will come up with a truly memorable riff, just to replace it almost instantly with another, less memorable riff section. The result of this is an album with a lot of riffs, albeit of average quality, and that simply fail to work from section to section. A good way to describe the riffwork presented here would be as \"directionless\", as even though the songs have a clear structure most of the time, the riffs don't. They just jump around and have strange changes without having any real interplay between each other. And in the end, out of their large number, only a very few remain in your head after the album is over.\n\nOne of my qualms with this album is the drumming. Not the actual drum performance, mind you; that is perfect, and on its own it's easily the best part of Human. No, the issue with it is that even though it's technically competent, it never reinforces the guitar work. It offers beats, and little fills, and a myriad of fancy things that are actually quite cool to listen to separately, but they never actually complement what the guitars are doing on top. As such, instead of adding power to the riffwork, they subtract it from an already weak composition. It truly is a sad thing; but then again it's Cynic's drummer, who works just fine when playing jazz fusion, but should be completely banned from playing death metal as a whole, ever. He lacks the groove for it, is what I mean. He doesn't understand it; he didn't understand it when playing on that horrible Focus album, and he obviously couldn't be counted on understanding it here, especially when the riffs themselves don't a lot of respect in the first place. The bottom line is that the drumming doesn't have any kind of interplay with the guitar work.\n\nRoaming through the mediocre riffage, the horrid Schaffer-like scooped guitar tone, and the spaced-out drumming that gives you a clinic instead of breaking your head, like a stray dog looking for shelter from the rain and elements, Chuck's raspy croak never changes at all. He really is one of the worst death metal vocalists ever, as he manages to always growl in the same way through every song, with the same tone, without changing styles at all. He would try out a different (worse) style on later albums, but his delivery is always the same: Stick to that particular style for the entire duration of the album, without ever modulating it at all. He must've thought his deep, philosophical lyrics somehow went right through the fact he still had to deliver them somehow, and that at that point nobody would care at all. It's not that his style is bad, it's that his style remains the same throughout the whole album - no shrieking, no gurgling, nothing at all - like he's simply bored and wanting to go through with those cartoonish death metal vocals as fast as possible, because god forbid they actually start sounding like a convention of the genre, right?\n\nThat is not to say the album is completely devoid of worth, otherwise it would get a much lower score. \"Flattening of Emotions\" has a very nice main riff that thankfully is milked just the right amount of times, and the trade-off solos between Schuldiner and Masvidal are of course masterful. Thankfully, Masvidal had no input at all on the album beyond the leads, or this album would stop being merely \"bad\" and begin moving into \"actively painful to listen\" territory. For all we know, he could have added robot vocals to the beginning of \"Lack of Comprehension\", or even worse, asked to sing on it. Fortunately that wasn't the case, and Chuck kept him, like all of the other musicians he used, mostly away from composing duties. In the end only his jazzy solos remain, which are actually very good as he is a brilliant shredder. However - and I'm sure this one will get me a lot of hatred if the rest of my sentiments towards this album already didn't - Chuck isn't. He was always kind of a crap lead player, is what I'm saying. The man had a very predictable soloing style, and it shows a lot - especially on this album. Just do a little sloppy widdly-doo section, followed by a small eastern-sounding lick, repeat, and then let Masvidal clean up your mess (or any other of his guitarists, really. Even James Murphy had more taste than him!).\n\nWhat do we have here, in the end? Actually, I have no idea. It's definitely a collection of songs, though; I give you that. Nevertheless, they don't work as a cohesive entity to give you something good, or at the very least, enjoyable. I have the impression some people see this album as a way to tell others that death metal can be smart and artistic just as fine as other genres (\"Look at the cover, guys! Anatomy is so fun!\"), and that their interest in the genre is, at most, transient. It's probably not all of them, but they're definitely quite a few. So there's definitely a collection of elements here that, together, in special occasions, could be called death metal; but their execution in Human leaves a lot to be desired. Sadly, this album became the face of the band (If not, it's a close second behind Symbolic) and actually a huge exponent of death metal as a whole. So there you have it - a weak album becoming a band's most remembered, the one everybody talks about as being \"smart\" evolving into one of the most lauded in the genre. I surely haven't heard of that one before.\n",
        "\nScream Bloody Gore was my first death metal experience and I'm very thankful I chose to start here. For 1987 this was pretty fuckin' brutal. Its only rivals may have been Pleasure to Kill or Seven Churches for the time period (INRI, Schizophrenia, and Deathcrush had yet to be released), but this album was the exemplar of what a true death metal record should sound like. \n\nDissonant, minor riffs, bludgeoning drumming, and inhuman vocals. The duo of Chuck Schuldiner and Chris Reifert gel tightly and pull these songs off like it's their bread and butter. Chuck's guitar tone is a little low in the mix, but this is nothing to worry about. The crushing, ghastly sounds coming from his amp make you feel like Chuck split a few zombies' skulls before the take. The melodic minor solos he uses are spectacular. Although not very technical, Chuck's soloing is instantly recognizable due to his distinct choice of scales and not your everyday pentatonic leads you hear all too often. Reifert's drumming is pretty standard, relatively fast, but nothing jumps out at me as groundbreaking. The drums and vocals are the highest and most prominent in the mix. Chris keeps up very well with Chuck and adapts to the timing changes flawlessly (ex. Baptized in Blood), but there's no Hoglan-esque (Dark Angel) or Asheim-esque (Deicide) fills to be found here. The bass is surprisingly easy to hear on any selection on the lp. Listen to the triplet fills during the verses of Scream Bloody Gore. This is one spot on the album where the bass isn't just following the root notes. Also, the bass is easily heard during the chorus on Denial of Life and Evil Dead. As for the production, it's bass heavy with no treble. \"Blunt\" best describes the sound of the album. It's not pummeling like being lit up by a thermobaric warhead, but more like sticking your head in a meat grinder and flipping the \"on\" switch. \n\nWhat really was a change for me listening to this album were the vocals and lyrics. Chuck's guttural roars create the image of a dismembered corpse screaming with festering abscesses in its throat. Pair that style with gory, grotesque lyrics and it's no wonder Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, and countless other death metal bands are influenced by this album. I'll admit sometimes I find myself laughing at some of the lyrics every now and then, hahaha. \"Slabs of fat lay on the ground, ram an axe into your mound.\" or \"Trying to escape, they torture you by\" CUTTING OFF YOUR COCK!, but the best one is \"Decapitated head, licking your cunt.\" LOL.\n\nI always found those lines funny. Needless to say, I had never heard any vocals or lyrics like that when I had first listened to it and apparently neither did a lot of people back in 1987. Tales of torture, zombie rituals, sacrificing cunts (lol), and mutilation as if they were being told by the unsympathetic being that committed the act really sets the mood/atmosphere for the music and I think Chuck captures his perfectly on the album. \n\nNow for the songs. Infernal Death I don't think is a strong opener for the album. The riffs and lyrics are nowhere near as menacing as on tracks like Mutilation or Zombie Ritual. It's weak compared to the following tracks, but optimistically it can only get better from here. It's virtually the only song on the album I would skip. Do yourself a favor and just get straight to Zombie Ritual. Holy shit. \n\nThe intro itself just sets the tone for this beast...eerie, twisted, unholy. One of the best tracks on the album, for sure. Lots of timing changes and riffs. DRINK FROM THE GOBLET, GOBLET OF GORE. Denial of Life was a popular live track from the early days (see Ultimate Revenge 2) and has a really catchy chorus. Sacrificial alternates between extremely slow verses and breakneck choruses. Always a fun listen miming the lyrics to this one (see above). Mutilation is completely unforgiving and never slows down. Just plain brutal. You won't have time to breathe until Regurgitated Guts starts. \n\nRegurgitated Guts has a sick, twisted intro and verse pattern and is probably my favorite track on SBG. The verses consist of mid-paced thrash chugging, then out of nowhere go double-time on your ass. I think Chuck and Chris are the tightest on this track more than any song on the album. Baptized in Blood has tons of timing changes and is the highlight of Chris' playing on the album. Cool lyrics, too, might I add. Torn to Pieces, like Sacrificial, has the most brutal (and arguably funniest) lyrics on the album. The riffs are kind of generic on this track, but the chorus just takes it to another level of savagery. Evil Dead only has a handful of riffs, but the intro is cool because it's a minor interpretation of Sortilege's Amazone. The title track is just as brutal as any of the rest and actually showcases the bass a bit during the verses. \n\nAlthough it may be tempting to skip, the bonus tracks on this album hold up to the rest of the others. Beyond the Unholy Grave is pretty damn fast and sounds almost like a Possessed song. Very recommended. Land of No Return is doomy as hell in the beginning and is a great way to round out this crazy gorefest. \n\nIf you crave a blunt, relentless, slaughter assault on your ears and are a veteran death metal listener or even new to death metal, this is the album for you. Newbies to death metal would be wise to start with this album. While it's not the best death metal album ever recorded, nor is it Chuck's magnum opus (that would come next year, in my opinion), it's a solid death metal output and I think sets the tone for death metal in years to come. This album will always hold a special place musically for me because it opened up the doorway to the realm of death metal and other forms of extreme metal I listen to today (CC, Morbid Angel, Deicide, Possessed, etc.). It all came from these 12 songs.\n",
        "\nSymbolic is an album I consider perfect. After the first listenings you may disagree, but then take another listen and feel how it simply gets better and better.\n\nI still don't remember when I got the cd. When looking back, all I see is the strange, but somehow catchy cover artwork staring into my mind. Complex, beautiful, and strange, but what does it mean? This is pretty much how I felt about the music at first. I liked the catchier songs like Crystal Mountain and Empty words with their melodic riffs and memorable choruses, the great guitar work, and especially the insane drumming by Gene \"the atomic clock\" Hoglan, but the other songs were rather difficult to remember. They just seemed to sound too similar and without a pattern. I knew there was a lot happening musically: riffs over riffs, intense vocals, and a wall of drumming, but for some time the songs just managed to escape my comprehension. Due to its euphoric reviews, I started listening again and again, and one by one the songs revealed their true nature - beauty hidden by complex riffing and song structures; like climbing a mountain I had to try again and again, but once arriving at the top, Symbolic offered me a overwhelming view on a musical landscape that's a beautiful, detailed patterns and boring not a single moment.\n\nSong after song started to make 'sense' to me. Every instrument and every riff wasn't playing somewhere somehow, but rather to create a certain atmosphere of sadness, sorrow, hope, or disgust. And don't let the harsh scream/shout of Evil Chuck distract you from the music. He isn't singing about disemboweling corpses, but about very personal and social issues like the growing observation and therefore loss of privacy (1000 Eyes) or the abuse of power by the church (Crystal Mountain).\n\nClearly necessary for such a complex album is outstanding musicality, and these guys definitely have it. As already mentioned, Chuck and Gene are doing most of the show here, but Bobby also has some serious skills (listen to the second guitar lead in Symbolic). Kelly Conlon at the bass guitar stays rather in the background, even though he sometimes breaks out of just following the guitar riffs (Sacred Serentiy, Without Judgement, and most notably, Crystal Mountain). What really helps getting into Symbolic is the excellent mix. It is clear and balanced, but not as sterile as many modern productions. You can hear every single instrument, although the bass could have been a bit louder.\n\nDescribing the genre of Symbolic, to give you a rough idea of what this album sounds like, is another really difficult thing. Is it death metal? Not really. Although Chucks vocals are rooted there, the melodic riffs and the progressive solo work disqualifies this from being death metal. And what about thrash metal? Technical death metal? Progressive metal? The last one seems to be fitting best, but after thinking about this issue for some time I came to the conclusion that every existing genre can only describe parts of Symbolic, thus it is best if you take a listen (Youtube, amazon...).\n\nSo do yourself a favour and by Symbolic instantly. Listen carefully to single instruments and passages, but then again to the album as a whole. Lose yourself in the sheer beauty (!) of those guitar leads and try to figure out what kind of miracle Gene is doing behind his kit. I listened to this album probably more than 200 times just in the last two years and every single listen was another stunning experience through Chuck's way of composing music. Still I haven't found a single flaw.\n",
        "\nThis is the latest album in the Relapse reissues series of the Death catalogue. It's an okay album, considering it's just two live albums slapped together. The first album in this set is the Live in LA from 1998, and the other is Live in Eindhoven, also from 1998. \n\nBoth of these live albums are good, but not great. They both start out with The Philosopher, an undisputed Death classic. The reason that I say that this album is good for new collectors is that real Death collectors probably already have both of these live recordings. \n\nThe albums are both of pretty good recording quality for a death metal band in the 90's, but the sound isn't too great. Live in Eindhoven seems to be a little more clear than the Live in LA recordings, probably because Death was playing the Dynamo festival on the Live in Eindhoven, while Live in LA was just Death headlining a small venue. The Live in LA tracks tend to be a little faster than both the live tracks on the other live disc, as well as being faster than the studio tracks themselves. One thing that peeves me about both live albums in this package is Chuck's voice. Everyone knows that his singing voice (or screeching voice if you prefer) got higher and higher as Death's career went on. The recordings of tracks from The Sound of Preserverance sound remarkably like the album versions (even though the both live recordings are pre the Sound of Preserverance,) but his vocals on the other tracks, primarily pre-Symbolic era tracks, are so strained and raspy that they kind of turn of the listener. Both of these albums are great, in my mind, but because of some of the recording issues, I'd have to list the Live in Eindhoven CD as my favorite of he two (I love albums to have good recording quality, one reason why the 'trve kvlt' black metal pisses me off.) \n\nI'm not going to go track by track in this review, only because both of these albums are already on this site. The recordings have been touched up a little bit, and thankfully, have a good range of songs (although there isn't much pre-Human era Death.) I'd have to give this album an 8 out of 10, primarily cuz I'm a bit of a Death fanboy, and can't rate them too low.\n",
        "\nYou do not need to be a frequent visitor to this site to realise I do love myself a bit of Death, the legendary metal band for whom seven albums was simply not enough before the tragic passing of mastermind Chuck Schuldiner in 2001. Such a legacy does not fade fast though and here we are with reissue three of the back-catalogue after reviews last year of \"The Sound of Perseverance\" and \"Human\". Now reviewing 1993's \"Individual Thought Patterns\" much of the past two reviews can be transposed here - lots about how Schuldiner & co (and it was really was a mighty 'co' on ITP with a dream line-up of Andy LaRocque, Steve DiGiorgio and Gene Hoglan in tow) were so far ahead of the time, that the individual performances in bringing to life these rhythmically complex songs are to this day second to none and that if passion was your aim in extreme metal this band is bullseye.\n\nOpener \"Overactive Imagination\" continues along the same mindframe that persisted through Death's 15-year career: why settle for second best? Though never aiming to break speed records, it begins in a fast, staccato manner in the verse before increasing into 5th gear for the chorus, with Hoglan's drumming in particular being the veritable punch in face we all like our death metal drumming to be, but here with the added bonus of not sounding like an overly-triggered machine. Oh the pleasure. \"In Human Form\" and \"Jealousy\" are a bit more considered in their approach, built upon Schuldiner's inimitable guitar abilities and tone. Throughout he mixes the kind of complex lead riffs and metronomically tight rhythms abridged perfectly by subtle changes in pace and direction that have inspired the likes of Obscura and a thousand others since to realise there is more to metal than simply being the 'heaviest' or fastest out there in return for a lack of control.\n\n\"Trapped in a Corner\" is a stand-out, introduced by the kind of riff that typified Death even back to \"Zombie Ritual\" on their \"Scream Bloody Gore\" debut LP and the following 4 minutes of avoid the genre cliches and concoct a palette of variation beyond all but a few. In the album's latter half the ante is upped with the title track and closing classic \"The Philosopher\", whose flowing bass lines and near-psychedelic solos are as deep and meaningful as the intelligent and socially-aware lyrics throughout.\n\nBeing a reissue a bonus disc is of course on offer and this time it is a performance from Germany in 1993, with a setlist pulling tracks from every album released to date. Being that Schuldiner passed away before I saw Death live I can only relate to these from a historic perspective but the feeling is this was Death at their peak and is a recording to be cherished for those lucky enough to have been there.\n\nFavourite Death albums vary from fan to fan - for this writer \"Individual Thought Patterns\" has only ever been a third or fourth favourite but let this be recognised as a nod to the quality of the back-catalogue. There is no doubt the average quality of death metal releases has plummeted in recent years as young bands rely far too much on studio technology than real writing chops. If ever there is was a band every death metal act should know inside out it is the peerless Death and this is a reissue shows why.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nTo me, \"Human\" still is the best Death album, but \"Symbolic\" has some good songs. Chuck put together a strong quartet featuring him on vocals/guitars, Bobby Koelble on guitars, Kelly Conlon on bass and Gene Hoglan on drums. Not their best lineup, but still high quality musicians. When I first heard this album, I didn't like it. I still think that some songs I cannot get into. I think that \"Symbolic\" is highly overrated. Yes, it has a strong production, mixing is good, though some tracks are just average to me.\n\nMusically speaking, songs like \"Empty Words\", \"1000 Eyes\", \"Crystal Mountain\" and the title track, are the most melodic and memorable. The riffs are amazing on those songs. Those happen to be my favorite tracks. The other ones are just average. Death has always been a growing band and \"Symbolic\" shows that and features a more progressive metal album. The rhythms are highly innovative and original, but the album as a whole is a disappointment to me. I can't see why people deem this to be their best album. The songwriting isn't at its greatest.\n\nIf Chuck would've designed the songs (all of them) to be more up to par, I would've given this one a higher rating. Sure there are those songs that I mentioned which are designed amazingly with riff structures that are very imaginative. I'd say out of 9 songs, 4 of them are good. The rest I don't really care for. That's just my personal opinion. I don't care for most of them because I just don't think that the music on those tracks are very good. There is variety though featuring some clean and acoustic guitars. It enhances the melodic distorted rhythms.\n\nA less than aggressive and angry Death album, \"Symbolic\" is their second most progressive metal output. \"The Sound of Perseverance\" is probably their most progressive and last Death release. The music on \"Symbolic\" is just not my favorite. The guitar solos, the riffs, the tempos, and the vocals didn't strike me the same way that \"Human\" did. The mixing was good though like I previously mentioned. Everything can be heard well. The guitars, vocals, drums and bass are mixed in there good. The lead guitar is a little bit hard to hear however.\n\nAfter repeated listens to, \"Symbolic\" is still not my favorite Death album. Yes it is creative and progressive, but still is highly overrated. Again out of 9 tracks, 4 to me are good. The rest of the release just didn't interest me. Musically Death has always been a growing band like I said, but Chuck could've made the whole album worthy of praise. The music, guitar solos and vocals aren't at their best. I think that if you want a quality Death release, pick up \"Human\" and you'll find that album to be musically their best. \"Symbolic\" to me was a big disappointment.\n",
        "\nAt times I am disgusted at the notion of milking a particular era of a band either for monetary gain or something else, not because of the prize being sought by the company, but because the results are almost always sub-par. And when separating the obviously charitable concept of buying an album to help save the artist's life, one might initially look at the 2 live releases that commenced in 2001 with a strong amount of skepticism, given they were both taken from the same tour, the same line up, and both contained radically similar set lists. There is, however, another angel that presents itself here that maybe argues that Nuclear Blast Records, in addition to having a benevolent side to them, also fully understood Death's audience.\n\nConsidering that Death is a band renowned for having very committed and avid fans, ones that were probably frequenting every record distribution outlet for the latest bootleg of a given tour/era, having 2 live albums from the same era would actually be quite appealing. Naturally this terminates on whether the era is one that appeals to the fan base, and many view the \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" era of Death as the weakest and merely an extension of Chuck's soon to be born power/progressive project Control Denied. With it comes the same high-pitched shouts that are perhaps more indicative of a melodic death metal outfit, and a similarly high end guitar sound that accents flash and speed over heaviness.\n\nUltimately, this album terminates on how well one likes the material Death put out either on or after \"Human\", as all but one song on here comes from said era. In terms of technical performance, this line up of musicians is well suited for exploiting the progressive elements of these songs, making for a very good rendition of \"The Philosopher\" and \"Together As One\", 2 of the more catchy songs on here, and also treating us to a fairly different vocal interpretation that avoids the lower, guttural shouts. The closing rendition of \"Pull The Plug\" is the only song on here that is robbed to any extent from the higher character of the arrangement, but even then the song still manages to be energetic and well put together.\n\nPurely on the merits, matching the enthusiasm of the performance (which is very high) to the production quality and interpretation, this comes out to be an even, albeit fairly average live album. No notes are missed, no beats skipped, nor is any scream botched, but at the same time the faint bass and the fairly mechanical feel of the performance and Chuck's overly humble interaction with the audience leaves this thing wanting. Sure, there is such a thing as over-doing crowd rallying, but Chuck comes off as slightly Kurt Cobain-like in his awkward avoidance of giving the fans the obligatory \"hell yeah\" that generally makes thrash metal concerts a treat, even when it's Metallica. Nevertheless, this could be picked up from a discount bin and be reasonably enjoyable, though the absence of the good cause it originally stood for makes it slightly less than essential.\n",
        "\nContention is a way of life for us in the metal world, we live and die by how much of it we can cause either amongst ourselves, or in the visible mainstream that we have a tenuous relationship with. And in death metal circles, few albums are more contentious than the last offering of the band after which the genre was coined. Some go so far as to assert that this album is not death metal at all, but some sort of extreme progressive album or, odder yet, an outright power metal album with harsh vocals. In an exterior sense, this viewpoint can be sympathized with as much of the material that made it onto \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" was intended for Chuck's soon to be born Control Denied project, which was an outright power/progressive effort. \n\nThe only retort that can really be made, and I share in making it, is that by 1998 death metal's boundaries did not conform to the same ones that were in place 10 years prior. When looking not only at the beginning breaks with tradition made by many other accomplished acts in the early to mid 90s, particularly that of Cynic, but also the rise of the heavy/power metal influences that crept into the scene via that Gothenburg scene, the notion of the narrow paradigm seized upon by Immolation and Incantation, though a very powerful one in itself, was no longer the case. And arguably, Chuck Schuldiner's early influences via certain NWOBHM bands made him something of a melodic death metal proponent before such a thing even existed, even going back to his earliest demo work in 1984-85.\n\nThat's the perplexing thing about the mixed reaction that \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" tends to receive. This album is not a sudden 90 degree left turn in the midst of a 15 year career of stylistic straight away driving, but a culmination of a lengthy period of evolution over the entire 1990s. It is possible to argue that the frog can jump out of the pan when the water starts to get hot, but that argument pretty well fails to make sense by the time \"Symbolic\" came out, an album that this one is not all that far away from. Yes, the strong influence of Chuck's earlier metal and progressive influences are strongest on this album. Yes, this album was created as a compromise with Nuclear Blast so that they would accept the Control Denied project. Of course, the lead guitar work gets dangerously close to show boating territory and Schuldiner's shouts are much higher in pitch and strongly resembles what is heard in early Children Of Bodom and Skyfire, but the separation between this album and the previous 2 is not as massive musically as one might assume.\n\nRight at the beginning of this album, it's clear that this is a version of Death that wants to showcase their chops, as the guitar lead-in to \"Scavenger Of Human Sorrow\" almost sounds akin to a Malmsteen paraphrase. As the song gets rolling, a familiar deluge of speeding thrash riff celebrations and rhythmic groove change ups enter the scene. This picture is a bit more mixed up and progressive on \"Bite The Pain\" and \"Story To Tell\", a couple of slower songs that play more into the mixed rhythm style that was very present on \"Symbolic\". \"Spirit Crusher\" and \"To Forgive Is To Suffer\" are where the comparisons to more power metal oriented melodeath bands come into play, as the song structure gets a bit more simplified and the catchy factor becomes incredibly overt, especially on the refrain of \"Spirit Crusher\", which would be excellent sing along material if most people could echo Schuldiner's agonized shrieks without ripping apart their vocal chords.\n\nBut all of what has been discussed here is pretty well par for the course in Schuldiner's evolutionary tendencies (minus his vocal shift). Amid the battering array of thunderous anthems are a couple of interesting twists that can be qualified as down right surprising. \"Voice Of The Soul\" is probably the most moving instrumental to ever come out of a death metal band, riding an intricate classical acoustic guitar line and highlighting both Schuldiner and newly recruited co-axe man Shannon Hamm (also on the Control Denied roster) ability to achieve a haunting melodic atmosphere and also show their shredding skills. The epic \"Flesh And The Power It Holds\" is also an impressive lead guitar display that could rival much of John Petrucci's work, and the large collection of musical ideas are not all that far from something that could have been heard on \"Awake\" if the keyboards took a hike and Schuldiner took over singing duties. And if that were not enough to put the dismissive \"all death metal sounds the same\" types in their place, things conclude with an amazingly faithful rendition of Judas Priest's \"Painkiller\", where Schuldiner's banshee screams remain morose yet somehow conform themselves to Halford's range, and we even get a taste of his clean melodic voice when the lead guitars aren't soaring in the upper stratosphere.\n\nOpinions will always vary on the nature of this album's genre, but a more important story is told within its songs. This is the closing opus of a project that began under the name Mantas, lead by a kid who had dreams of recording old school heavy metal, got caught up in a more dangerous and trailblazing art form, and then finally came full circle. It's uncertain if Chuck left this world feeling that he fully accomplished what he set out to do, but whatever he intended, he leaves behind a highly influential discography that inspires bands to test their premises on what metal actually is. \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" could be seen as somewhat self-serving given that it showed Chuck beginning to break with his established audience, but considering what came before it, he clearly deserved some self-gratification, and ended up recording yet another intricate fit of controlled rage in the process.\n",
        "\nThere might be something to the notion that artists aren't fully appreciated until after they've died, particularly where Death and its central figure Chuck Schuldiner are concerned. On the other hand, one might argue that the recent aftermath of the craftsman's end, timely or not, lead to a period of inflated interest. Whatever the case may be, the passing of Chuck in the early 2000s ushered in a whole generation of itching ears who did not have the privilege of either seeing Death live or on MTV back when the channel was still worth a damn. And with that has come a favoritism toward the latter day works, specifically following Spiritual Healing that are not immediately shared by mainline death metal fans, particularly of the 80s and early 90s persuasion.\n\n\"Symbolic\" is a difficult album to fully categorize, which makes the massive amount of interest in it all the more intriguing. It definitely has a progressive nature to it, incorporating not only the classical, jazz and rock influences that were already pretty well present on Individual Thought Patterns, but also further elements of early 90s groove/thrash and even, to a degree, the older melodic metal bands that Schuldiner first took a liking to before switching over to the death/thrash sound of Possessed that inspired his seminal albums. The resulting melodic passages and general progression of the songs gives a nod towards the emerging Swedish melodeath scene, to almost the same degree as Carcass' Heartwork, though from an even more virtuoso-based and progressive angle that also takes into account the waves Cynic had made with Focus.\n\nFrom the inception of the catchy and dark title song, there is a sense of duality between simplicity and complexity that creates an ingenious sense of tension upon which the philosophical lyrical pondering is given a fitting tableau. The first riff is cut from a haunting, Mid-Eastern character that reminds slightly of Slayer's various offerings via Seasons In The Abyss, and is actually among the more groove-driven ideas Chuck has ever come up with, almost to the point of channeling Exhorder. In the often abrupt fashion, things are quickly turned to a mixture of rhythmic twists and thrashing passages that are about as jostling as they are brilliant. The song goes a bit long, as does much of the album, but the odd assortment of shift in feel and melodic hooks keep things interesting.\n\nFor the most part, this album straddles a number of stylistic fences, almost to the point of becoming schizophrenic, and yet nothing seems at all out of place. The heavier numbers \"Zero Tolerance\", \"1,000 Eyes\" and \"Misanthrope\" play up the older thrash metal influences a good bit, while \"Empty Words\", \"Sacred Serenity\" and the spellbinding mixture of melodic and progressive elements that is \"Crystal Mountain\" seem to channel elements of Fates Warning within an obviously more aggressive template. The result is a collection of songs that, even when as short as 4 and a half minutes in length, make themselves as busy as possible while somehow managing to stay catchy. There are literally a couple of instances on some of these songs, particularly the closer \"Perennial Quest\" where elements of At The Gates have managed to find their way into Chuck's riff set, alongside a lot of other stuff like a serene minute long clean fade out with volume swell guitar leads that sound like a lone mourner in a cemetery in the failing light.\n\nThe greatest strength of this album is its complexity, and ultimately its greatest weakness is, well, its complexity. While this is definitely a worthy successor to Individual Thought Patterns (still my favorite Death album to date), it actually reaches just a tiny bit too far into the progressive realm and occasionally gets convoluted. Granted, it's one of the better convoluted albums I've ever heard, and it is understandable why this album is praised to no end. In many ways the early offerings of Dark Tranquillity, Arch Enemy and In Flames resemble this album's sort of wandering stylistic aspersions, though not to the point of occasionally channeling Rush or Dream Theater as this does. It's a high water mark for melodic death metal, and while the progressive label fits equally as well, that's pretty much the label I tend to place it under. Just one more towering accomplishment by a man who was taken from us way too soon.\n",
        "\nIt could be stipulated that the advent of direct mp3 downloads has brought about the dual accomplishment of resurrecting the single and all but destroying the purpose of compilations. Being a full length album junkie myself, neither one of these changes in the economics of recording industry profit-mongering really phases me. But for some reason I found myself back at the bargain bin, gazing at a really beat up jewel case with a somewhat faded booklet containing this best of release from Death's so-called true death metal era (aka the \"Scream Bloody Gore\" to \"Human\" era). My better sense wants to punch me in the face for this decision, but at a mere $2.50 I figured what could be the harm?\n\nMost compilations of this sort tend to get created in order for a band to fulfill a contract that isn't as good as it seemed at its signing, such as the very similarly pointless and poorly constructed \"Capitol Punishment\" put out by what was left of 90s Megadeth. But \"Fate\" doesn't really even have the excuse of ending a bad contract as it came about through One Flag Records getting rights to the songs via Combat Records, nor does it contain any new or exclusive material not on 4 already published full length albums. The polarizing nature of not only death metal, but Death as a band, pretty well invalidates anyone with a fleeting interest being the type to purchase this album, so the lack of bonus material already puts this thing at a disadvantage, even in the context of 1992 when online digital sale of individual songs was not yet possible.\n\nAll things thus being considered, the only real value that this unfortunate collection could have would be through its unique presentation and flow. In such things, song selection and pacing are key, and on this front this thing fails even harder. The two offerings from \"Human\" utterly clash with the rest of the material on here, and the inclusion of \"Spiritual Healing\" throws additional pacing issues onto a compilation dominated by the archaic 80s death/thrash that came in shorter and simpler doses. \"Mutilation\" and \"Zombie Ritual\" are obvious choices from a standpoint of a greatest hits approach as they lend the most towards accessibility and catchiness, as does \"Pull The Plug\", but these songs are spread out in the track order. Indeed, the selected ordering of these songs comes off as completely random apart from putting \"Zombie Ritual\" at the beginning.\n\nI might be one to dismiss this album as mere profit-seeking, but the problem is that this doesn't really profit anyone. How this could have sold to any great extent is beyond me, as Death's devout followers would already possess all of these songs, and few fans of Poison or Pearl Jam would have ponied up for any of these songs. This is the handiwork of people who don't have a genuine understanding of the actual market and how death metal consumers tend to operate, hence the auspicious shortage of greatest hits compilations of this sort popping up in affiliate bands unless they come with plenty of exclusively released perks. I can't fully bomb this thing because all of these songs are great, but even at under $3, this is just not worth getting.\n",
        "\nProgression is a risky business, particularly when one is comfortably coasting on a winning niche that few can claim as being at the forefront of before it became the flavor of the early 90s. Nevertheless, that was what death metal as a whole was doing by said time period, progressing into something quite a bit different than the stereotype associated with the genre's name. Sure, a scene focused more on brutality was keeping up this side of things and actually extending it to the point of near ridiculousness. But the likes of Darkthrone (pre-black metal era), Nocturnus, Cynic, and co-pioneer of the style Death were looking beyond the horrors of either the nightmarish world of flesh eating zombies or real world monstrosities, and instead to some place amongst the stars above, contemplating the vast, undiscovered country beyond this island Earth (obligatory dual Sci-Fi film reference).\n\nWith this progression came a more philosophical outlook on lyrics and a broader array of atmospheric devices to complement the still firmly established extreme thrash and doom influences. But of all the albums that were brought out by the previously mentioned acts, Death's 4th studio effort \"Human\" actually comes off as being more conservative. The inclusion of Cynic's guitarist and drummer on this album presented Chuck with a greater degree of technical possibilities, and he does a nice job of exploiting them. The riff work can be categorized as somewhat busier and more prone towards flashy fills and virtuosic solos, not all that far removed from something Dream Theater might use in passing, but it still maintains that thick, thrashing edge, albeit in a somewhat more modern and mechanical fashion. The proficiency Sean Reinert at the kit is the largest shift in sound, bringing in some more elaborate beats than the straight ones that largely dominated the first two albums, and particularly loading up on the double bass work something fierce.\n\nBut ultimately what this album accomplishes musically is some stylistic tinkering around the edges rather than an outright genre shift (\"Focus\") or a permanent atmospheric gimmick that completely alters the nature of the style (\"The Key\" and \"Soulside Journey\"). Crushing fits of heavy riffing with a jolting production such as \"Flattening Of Emotions\", \"Together As One\" and \"See Through Dreams\" definitely remind a bit of the Death of the past couple albums, though the melodic tendencies of some of the guitar work almost leans towards a hint at melodeath with a heavy edge. The only real blatant departures from the established paradigm occur during the intro of \"Lack Of Comprehension\" that sounds like a spacey jazz music outtake, and \"Cosmic Sea\" which is a really out there mishmash of ambient and progressive elements, bringing in a dense keyboard backdrop, a barrage of fancy lead guitar work, and some busy bass work out to complement the atmosphere.\n\nIronically enough, this is among the shorter albums put out by this band, bucking the trend of so-called progressive albums being loaded up with 6 minutes plus fits of technical showboating and genre splicing. In fact, it's chief flaw is that it ends way too quickly, as if it could have had 1 or 2 additional songs tacked on to the end. Musically speaking it's not a massive enough of a departure to really warrant the heavy praise and occasional condemnation it receives, it could even be labeled as product of its time in much the same way that \"Scream Bloody Gore\" was. It's not a mystery that fans of older Death can and often do take to this album, though it does reveal a level of eclecticism amongst death metal junkies that often conflicts with the stereotypes often attributed to their lot. If nothing else, even when progressing in a very gradual and intentional manner, Schuldiner was still setting trends more than following them, and this album's conformity to an existing trend is likely more coincidental than not.\n",
        "\nThere's this false dichotomy between innovation and vegetation that some say has to exist for any band that can survive beyond 2 or 3 albums. It presupposes that a band has to either engage in genre hopping in order to stay relevant or that there is some sin in maintaining a consistent style, as if there were no wrong way to innovate and no way at all to keep a soldier-like precision of sound and keep things fresh. Chuck Schuldiner found himself at this media inflicted crossroad after the release of what many consider the pinnacle of the Death name in \"Leprosy\", and decided to evolve on his own terms, something a successful band is instructed never to do.\n\n\"Spiritual Healing\" could be seen as a stylistic continuation of the heavily thrash infused sound of Death's earlier days with a handful of musical reservations, but is also a near 180 in terms of lyrical subject matter. While the riff set is still very agitated and the mixture of fast mosh sections to haunting breakdowns is comparable to the even one of \"Leprosy\", the otherworldly realm of horrific mutilation and other nightmarish scenarios of undead carnage has been replaced by something equally if not more frightening, the real world. And surprisingly enough, the suffering of crack babies, the vile future of dictatorial eugenics and ultra-Malthusian politics, and the obvious theme of living and dying by the sword while cloaked in the veil of religious superiority suggested in the album's title and cover art prove to be equally appropriate themes for a style more readily identified with Schuldiner's prior lyrical interests.\n\nFrom the start, things retain a frenetic feel, but the overall presentation is a bit more disciplined and measured. From its instigation, \"Living Monstrosity\" literally brings down the judgment of both God and society upon every woman who has condemned an infant to a short life of suffering through drug use, albeit from a journalistic perspective that allows the listener to render the actual sentence of scorn, and the music follows suit with a combination of dissonant guitar harmonies and a surprisingly virtuosic set of solos. \"Altering The Future\" comes in with a familiarly doom drenched intro like the trudging of a horse through a tar pit, then after a minute launches into a faster groove that eventually lands back in mad thrashing territory, almost like a longer and slightly more mature rendition of \"Zombie Ritual\". \n\nAs things continue to unfold, it's clear that the formula is leaning towards a longer, more varied approach to songwriting that hints at a coming change in stylistic direction. This is best underscored in the title song, which goes on for near 8 minutes and covers almost every creative niche in Schuldiner's arsenal up to this point. In many ways, this song is reminiscent of the progressive direction that the thrash metal scene was largely moving towards, almost as if offering the emerging death metal scene something along similar lines to Heathen's \"Victims Of Deception\" with a raw growl and a more aggressive answer to the question or religious hypocrisy. Naturally there are a handful of songs on here such as \"Defensive Personalities\" and \"Killing Spree\" that tow the line of \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and \"Leprosy\" and are more straight up thrashing than progressive, but the general spirit of this album is geared towards something a bit less subject specific, and ultimately broader in scope.\n\nIn the grand scheme of Death's amazing time as a force in the shaping of death metal, \"Spiritual Healing\" holds the stereotypical transitional album label, and in much the same way as \"Blizzard Beasts\" and \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\", it ranks high among the band's discography though not quite at the top. It doesn't quite have the focus and charm of \"Individual Thought Patterns\", nor does it have the raucously chaotic nature of \"Leprosy\", it's sort of in between the two, offering a bit of both in a fairly even handed manner. The only flaw it suffers from is that the production comes off as a little too clean and polished for its own good, resulting in a drum sound that isn't quite as punchy as previous works, and ironically pretty close to the mechanical feel of \"Human\" in that one area. Sometimes even the most depressingly antisocial death metal addict needs a break from cannibalistic zombies and autopsy descriptions, and \"Spiritual Healing\" is a good place to go without sacrificing all the other necessary elements of the genre.\n",
        "\nDeath metal, the refuge of all things brutal and horrific, the pillar of everything considered obscene and repulsive about the latter half of the sub-genre. In recent years, becoming something of a twisted parody of itself, losing any sense of connection to an essential humanizing element that it once carried. Like a blossoming plant with an extravagant array of colors and intricate flowers and branches, today's modern death outfit charges forth with an array of technological wonders and higher mathematical formulas for further mechanizing a once organic and flesh-bound art form. One could perhaps chalk this pretentious aside up to an old fogey looking to admonish the younger generation of their debaucherous abandonment of past dogmas, but this assumes that I was old enough to have comprehended the late 80s origins of the genre (I was born about 6 years too late), and that I consider all strains of modern death metal to be empty expressions of cartoonish brutality or technicality (I don't).\n\nContrary to what might be assumed, death metal did not begin as a meer mindless, otherworldly venture into rejecting every musical convention ever concocted. Quite the contrary, when looking at the early works of Possessed and Sepultura and Death, present sentiments might simply pass off the death metal designation as a misnomer to categorize a slightly more extreme version of thrash metal (this is a lot more common than one might think). And particularly when looking at the formative demo work and eventual debut in \"Scream Bloody Gore\", there is something of an argument for Death simply being a thrash metal band when compared against Slayer, Kreator, Sodom or even the recently hatched extreme thrash outfit Morbid Saint. While I reject this viewpoint in actuality, canceling out the obvious vocal stylistic departure of Chuck Schuldiner might lend itself to a Teutonic thrash equivocation in theory.\n\nHowever, this selective historical revisionism runs into trouble when dealing with the immediate follow up and widely hailed beast of brutality that is \"Leprosy\". Named for one of the most disgusting and fearsome of fatal diseases that can afflict the human body, this crazed collection of morbid horrors leaves any notion of subtlety or nuance at home and comes gunning for the ears with both barrels blazing. Even by present day standards, let alone the slightly more naive times of the late 80s, this album is pretty damn brutal affair that might challenge some of the younger trustees of Necrophagist and the like to hold on to their flesh sewn hats. Perhaps the best analogy would be to the story of horror/slasher film mastermind Wes Craven being sickened and having to leave a private screening of \"Resevoir Dogs\" during the infamous ear slicing scene. The scene itself isn't the most gorey thing ever depicted, but the realism factor is enough to sicken the people who did the animation for the closing scene of \"Akira\".\n\nThe mechanics of this album is largely where the realism factor comes into play. Each of it's 8 decrepit chapters mixes the revolting gore elements of the debut with a somewhat more socially aware and, for lack of a better word, real world sense of fear. But the format is very much song oriented, not veering too far away from the established verse and chorus model that was still employed by Venom, Bathory, and most of the thrash metal acts that followed them. At it's peak, it comes off as a slightly rawer and heavier answer to \"Persecution Mania\", but with a greater element of slower and moderately fast sections in between, complemented with an assortment of deep, chunky guitar work and chaotic double bass rumbles. Particularly when dealing with the longer works in \"Choke On It\" and the riveting title song \"Leprosy\", there is a greater degree of doom and mid-paced thrashing sections to complement the crazed tremolo riffs and blasting, bringing along with it an even more elaborate and almost progressive version of the creepy descending melodies and harmonies that were also being explored on \"Reign In Blood\" and \"South Of Heaven\".\n\nBut even amid a progressing format that sees Chuck honing his songwriting abilities and also exploring a slightly more melodic, though still very shred happy lead guitar character, much of this is album tends to conform to the rapid fire lunacy of \"Scream Bloody Gore\". \"Born Dead\" and \"Left To Die\" both could have easily shared a song set with the likes of \"Infernal Death\" and \"Evil Dead\", plowing through a polished collection of speed riffs and ferocious drum beats. Perhaps the only thing that gives this album an edge in the heaviness department when compared to the likes of \"Pleasure To Kill\" and Persecution Mania\" is the bass presence, which perfectly bonds itself to the riffs and makes them twice as meaty. For the most part it is content to double the guitars or simply keep the root during the harmony parts while also mimicking the rhythm of the drums, but the tightness and edge it brings into the equation would definitely be missed had this album taken a production route similar to \"...And Justice For All\".\n\nWhile Cannibal Corpse and others in the early 90s may point to Slayer as the principle influence, it's hard to see any of these bands doing it the way they do had this album not been put together to take it to the next level in the aftermath of \"Reign In Blood\". And while \"Eaten Back To Life\" definitely upped the ante in terms of grotesque lyrical depictions, this album definitely edges it out in overall presentation. The last album presented a banquet with adorned tankards filled with human blood, this one sees them filled with pus from the lanced boils of a black plague victim, and it's difficult to see a listener (forgive the pun) choke on it, at least the first time through. A masterful effort for a band whose early material may not appeal to the current brutal obsessed crowd, but one that they, along with all other extreme metal enthusiasts, should definitely be aware of.\n",
        "\nThere is a certain fallacy in judgment that is often paraded out whenever an alleged classic album comes under the scrutinizing eyes of a younger generation. The old cliche of hindsight always being 20/20 need not bear much repetition in order for its obviousness to be proved out on this subject, as many will look at the archaic nature of an album and dismiss it as something that has either aged poorly, or is otherwise obsolete in light of newer accomplishments. One is often reminded of the overshadowing success of comedian Dennis Leary when compared with his predecessor Bill Hicks. Sure, the former brought out a nervous, pissed off, Irish chain-smoker on crack to make himself distinct from the low-key, intellectual, laid back chain-smoker from Texas, but in the end, the fact that the jokes were all but identical, the props automatically go to the one telling them 5 years prior, despite that he didn't live long enough to have a long winded movie career and television show.\n\nSuch is the scrutiny placed upon Death's auspiciously wicked debut \"Scream Bloody Gore\", an album that is sometimes saddled with the \"glorified thrash metal\" label and diminished in its significance in light of the exaggerated versions paraded out first by Cannibal Corpse, then by Cryptopsy and every other extreme death metal band to spring out of the mid 1990s. It's often conceded that the album was about as intense as 1987 could possibly have gotten, but it's just too old and rusty to really stand the test of time. Why bother with the mud covered foundation of a genre that was built by this outfit over 3 years of paying their dues in the Florida scene when there's a nifty new band in the mold of Fleshgod Apocalypse or Braindrill with its ridiculously fast blast beats, inhumanly technical guitar solos and very little of an actual song to be heard amid the chaos. One can only conclude that the price of the heavy exposure of Death after Chuck's untimely passing is that every fool gets their 2 cents in.\n\nTo put it bluntly, the album in question here is actually time appropriate for 1987 given the recent advent of the unholy trinity (\"Reign In Blood\", \"Darkness Descends\" and \"Pleasure To Kill\" respectively), save that most of these songs were written much earlier and Chuck Schuldiner's unusually intense and auspiciously toneless vocal style. The feel is generally one-dimensional, largely resembling the 3 albums in question, along with Possessed's \"Seven Churches\", a band that was admittedly a huge influence of Chuck's songwriting early on. It cooks at a rapid thrashing pace for about 90% of the time, while the other 10% manifest in earlier slow, doom-laden intros or mid-tempo sections that pop up within otherwise high octane songs. It's the sort of album that might wear thin after a few successive listens, but has incredible replay value after a break of a day or two.\n\nAnyone who had been in Florida from 1984-86 and seen Death on tour could easily see this as being a sort of best of album compiled out of a pool of a little under 30 songs, but it listens like a very careful contemplated killer of an album. The pacing is very well realized, allowing for straight up cruisers like \"Mutilation\" and \"Beyond The Unholy Grave\" to trade blows with the more mixed numbers in \"Zombie Ritual\" and \"Sacrifical\", the latter of the two incorporating a very intricate mixture of doom and groove that paint a dark, haunting character to complement what is otherwise a straight linel exercise in brutality. The lyrical content fits in snugly with this all guts and occasional respites, covering all of the horrific scenes of gore and violence that could be contemplated for a slasher or zombie flick, yet with a novelty and level of intelligence that is generally lacking from what passes for this genre today.\n\nPerhaps the greatest charm of this album is that while it seems to be predicting the chromatic, atonal character of latter offerings in this style, it doesn't venture too far from convention songwriting and manages to be catchy without losing its intensity. Particularly in the case of the melodic tendencies of \"Evil Dead\", a song that borders on being proto-melodeath, mainly because of its earlier conception than most of the other songs on here and the obvious influence it was likely taking from Venom and Celtic Frost, alongside the already emerging Possessed influences. Other songs have more of a creeping feel to them that hints at further Hellhammer/Celtic Frost influences still clinging on, particularly \"Baptized In Blood\" and the intro of \"Infernal Death\" which provide an archetype of what would be the slower side of death metal nowadays.\n\nFar from being a mere SRB rocket that can be detached from the shuttle once its usefulness is over, this is an album that should be essential listening to any self-respecting fan of extreme metal, as well as the usual suspects who cling to their 80s thrash and religion. It's archaic nature robs nothing from its intensity, and it lacks the fairly annoying mechanistic tendencies of most modern bands, particularly that clicking bass drum sound, popping snare and over-processed guitar distortion. So pour yourself a tall chalice of human blood and chill with the scarlet and purple clad skeleton bishops of the deathly throne, because it doesn't get much better than this.\n",
        "\nWhile still somewhat buried in obscurity by 1986 outside of Florida, within their own little locale Death was definitely making a name for itself by this point, earning their credentials on the road from one venue to the next. In their wake, a massive collection of demos and rehearsals that show a band going by that age old ethic of musicians practice until they get it right, artists practice until they can't get it wrong. But all of this speed infused mayhem had to eventually lead somewhere, and all roads ultimately point to the wicked 1-2 punch that would be \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and \"Leprosy\", both of which profited by including songs from the formative, demo crazy era of the band's early days.\n\n\"Mutilation\" might be considered a tame title when compared to the satiracle, unintentionally funny excesses that were ushered in by Cannibal Corpse, but in the context of its day, it was probably turning plenty of heads, and the music follows suit. Contained on here are 3 songs that would ultimately end up on the band's studio debut (albeit one as a bonus track exclusive to the CD before later reissues came about), and provide much of the high octane, thrash happy goodness with a ghoulish vocal job that would characterize \"Scream Bloody Gore\". There is a formulaic tendency of introducing things in a creepy, doom-laden manner before hitting the afterburners, and it holds true for all these songs save the title track which goes straight for the jugular and rivals the wildest riff sets ever put together by any extreme thrash outfit.\n\nWhat ultimately puts this particular demo above all the others is that, as a whole, it's a much more polished effort than anything previously put out. The mixing job is a bit more even-handed, though the bass still tends to struggle for audibility once the thrashing commences, and the high end of the drums still somewhat overshadows things. Chuck's voice has found its edge and pretty closely resembles what would be heard a year later, and the solo work has been cleaned up to the point that it still achieves that chaotic element without sounding like an outright copy of Slayer's approach, and that wicked atmosphere that the band is known for comes to full fruition in the slower sections of \"Zombie Ritual\", arguably the band's most well known song from this period for its distinctive blend of slower, creepier elements.\n\nWhile any one of Death's many demos can be seen as consequential from a historical standpoint, this is the one to get if overall quality of sound is the aim. It's basically a rehearsal for what would eventually be the final recording project for all 3 of these songs, along with 9 other lucky candidates that didn't suffer the fate of a number of other worthy songs in being buried forever in the obscurity of pre-1986 underground metal. Finding this in original tape form will be a bitch and a half, so the smarter bets should be placed on an mp3 version.\n",
        "\nChuck Schuldiner's mad excursions into the realm of darkness and gore brought forth some rather wild creations in 1984, but by 1985 it was clear the ante was being upped, particularly when accounting for the emergence of a newer, nastier thrash metal style coming about in Germany and the first full length death metal release in \"Seven Churches\". Some might assume it criminal that it took a label another 2 years to give Death its shot at a professional recording job, but even on their own they were a massive force to be reckoned with, especially when accounting for the fit of blazing fury that is \"Infernal Death\".\n\nThe best analogy that could be made between where this demo stands in contrast to that of \"Reign Of Terror\" is that of \"Night Of The Living Dead\" versus \"Dawn Of The Dead\". Both have extravagant elements of horror and intrigue, but the latter has a much more developed and stylized character to it that's a bit easier to grab onto. While the principle influence here is still based in the thrash metal genre, the speed and chaos factor has increased, and along with it the dynamic elements of the vocals at the helm. Chuck goes through a frenetic array of deed grunts and high pitched screams that are reminiscent of a dialogue between an enraged ghoul and his victim, while the music channels the picture of zombies sprinting, a more recent phenomenon of latter day zombie movies that was unheard of during the film genre's beginnings.\n\nThe first two songs on here will ring familiar to anyone who has already experienced \"Scream Bloody Gore\", and apart from a slightly higher pitched vocal job and a bit more fuzz in the production, both bring about that same creepy doom intro leading into a crazed thrashing frenzy. But the lone exclusive song that didn't make onto further releases in \"Archangel\" is the real highlight, featuring a very technical mix of guitar and bass lines that is a bit closer to what was being played with during Death's transitional album \"Spiritual Healing\", but interpreted through the darkened mysticism of mid 80s death metal rather than the progressive tendencies of said album. It actually proves to be even more chaotic than the other two once it gets going, and is arguably a cut above anything that Possessed ever put together.\n\nThis is definitely among the more accessible offerings of Death's demo era, and an absolute keeper for any rabid fan of Possessed or pre-\"Altars Of Madness\" era Morbid Angel. It sits on a fairly comfortable niche between two styles that began all but joined at the hip, but with the coming of the later 80s onslaught of hardcore infused outfits like Napalm Death and Carcass, would be severed and given time to grow and mature on their own. Or to put it more plainly, this is death metal for thrash metal fans.\n",
        "\nWhile the Mantas demo \"Death By Metal\", which came shortly after Possessed's pioneering \"Death Metal\" demo, stands as a formative example of the early death metal sound, it wasn't until after Chuck decided to change his band's name that the typical sound that has come to be associated with the band started to emerge. This long stint of independent touring and honing of the style that took place in the mid 80s was advantageous in defining where thrash metal ends and death metal begins, but in the latter months of 1984 when \"Reign Of Terror\" was conceived, the distinction was still pretty difficult to catch.\n\nThough unlike the Mantas material, this demo showcases the tremolo based, low end riff set that has come to define most 80s and early 90s death metal offerings, the problem lay in the fact that this style of riffing was also being incorporated heavily by Slayer, the Teutonic Trio, and a couple of other bands that can't claim the death metal moniker. The only real distinction lay in Chuck's vocal interpretation, which has begun to take on the more guttural and muddled character that would be further exaggerated by David Vincent and Chris Barnes later on, but here it is still very intelligable and has more of a muttering feel than an actual barking quality, save a few higher pitched shouts intermingled with what largely sounds like angered spoken passages.\n\nFor the most part, the contents on here sounds a good bit like Slayer's \"Reign In Blood\" about a year and a half before it was put together. The signature crusher \"Corpsegrinder\" stands as one of the most insanely brutal things to be created in 1984, trudging through a decrepit swamp of low tone tremolo lines at the pace of a sprinting wolf, painted over by a diabolical Schuldiner, whose voice has been drenched with studio reverb to the point that the echoes overtake the drums. The rest of the demo tends to follow a similar approach, each one featuring brief bursts of lead guitar frenzies that closely resemble the Slayer model heard on \"Haunting The Chapel\", being mostly pentatonic in character but dressed up with plenty of whammy bar dives and flurries of chromatic scale runs, particularly on \"Witch Of Hell\".\n\nIt's somewhat depressing that Schuldiner didn't see it necessary to release some of these songs either as part of \"Leprosy\" or even put together another album in the mold of \"Scream Bloody Gore\" including these, but so goes the world of compromising with record labels when you have 4 years worth of compositions to choose from and limited time in the studio. Some day someone ought to cover these songs and give them their time in the sun with a cleaned up production, though it wouldn't be the same without Chuck to lend his voice to the affair. Nevertheless, the contents on here are a bit clearer than that of \"Death By Metal\", and have an appeal beyond their historic significance.\n",
        "\nOne helluv a collection of songs built by the Godfather of death metal, Chuck Schuldiner. As a voice for Death, he chooses to sing in a higher pitch on vocals that reflect Death's last album \"The Sound of Perseverance\". On second guitar is Shannon Hamm who illustrates a guitarist that replicates past Death member solos quite vividly. Richard Christy is on drums and Scott Clendenin on bass. \n\nAbout 80 minutes of a crowd frenzied set, Death is at their best. No one can replicate Chuck's insanely amazing solos and incredibly awesome riff built songs. A mixture of then past and more recent songs. This was after all Death's \"The Sound of Perseverance\" tour. The intensity of the live footage is quite immense. The whole band was in sync for every song old and newer.\n\nThere stood the figure of a now dead commander of death/progressive metal outputs. Chuck Schuldiner was a legend, both on the set and as a person. Sad to see a man who had all of the potential in the world to give more to the Metal community, but left us at such a young age due to brain cancer. Death - Live In L.A. was a maddening collection of impeccable songs.\n\nThe sound quality of the album was top notch. You can hear all of the instruments and vocals vividly. Some of Death's best songs are featured on here and a couple that I thought less highly of. Overall, the performance was amazing. The leads were impeccable by both guitarists. Shannon Hamm had a unique picking style and Chuck was fast and furious with his solos.\n\nOverall, a great performance by all band members. If you're a death metal fan and haven't seen this DVD, get it, it's worth it's weight in gold. You can actually see and hear all of the band member's outputs distinctly. Chuck left this Earth too soon but his legacy lives on through his music. Death remains to be the founding group of the death metal genre. No mistaking that.\n",
        "\nMany people recommended me to try out some records of the legendary death metal band Death and I decided to start chronologically. During the last months and years I got more and more into progressive and twisted extreme metal music from underground black metal such as Putamen Insula over pagan metal stuff such as Pagan Flame to melodic death metal in the key of In Flames, experimental extreme metal such as the last effort of Morbid Angel or simply avant-garde extreme metal like UneXpect. I also like thrash metal and liked the last records of Anthrax, OverKill or Heathen as well as the classics from Loudness to Voivod.\n\nBut the Death's debut album really isn't my cup of tea. It's simply put ordinary death metal with a lot of thrash influences that remind me of Slayer or Venom. There is also a slight hardcore punk attitude within some of the tracks. The band shows some glimpses of their true talent as in the track \"Sacrificial\" that has some interesting slow breaks and a sharp but melodic guitar solo, the short atmospheric introduction of \"Baptized In Blood\" or the different kinds of screams and stunning guitar solos on \u201cTorn To Pieces\u201d. The most interesting track on the record is probably \u201cEvil Dead\u201d with a great atmospheric opening, a dominant bass guitar and a simple but addicting riff. There is some light on this record but the shades are really predominant to me. That's why my final verdict is a little harsh as we don't have some dumb amateurs on here that don't know how to do a better job but some gifted musicians that lose their time and energy and lack of the creativity that could have been in here. \n\nBut most of the songs bore with similar approaches, exchangeable high speed riffs without emotions and mediocre vocals. The album feels long and is very hard to listen to from the beginning to the end. The lyrics are as superficial as the childish album title. Songs like the mediocre opener \u201cInfernal Death\u201d or the dumb \"Mutilation\" among many others only repeat other tracks on the same record and literally bore me to death, maybe that's the reason why the band called itself like this. Interesting passages of thirty seconds in many tracks are not enough to weight up the value of the songs that are generally around seven times as long as the promising passage. \n\nToday, the death metal genre has so much diversity to offer and many excellent bands started and excelled in this genre such as my favourite's Therion and Amorphis for example. But this kind of music here is even quite closed minded and generic if we take into consideration the age of the record. At that time, many bands already experimented a lot with heavier music and developed more and more complex music. Death may be among the pioneers of their genre but even the first thrash records of Metallica or Loudness were already way more original than this soulless output. My final verdict can only be that this record is heavily overrated and not a good introduction to the works of the band.\n",
        "\nI was sitting the other day thinking about Chuck Schuldiner and these new Death reissues and wondering how cool Chuck would undoubtedly think it is that Death is so revered after all this time. When you hear about the Floridian death metal scene it starts and pretty much ends with Chuck and Death, and there really is no need to go into the history and lineage; if you\u2019re reading this you know who the man was and who he will ever be, not to mention how important he is to all of heavy metal. Let\u2019s talk about the Human reissue, yes? Human was considered by many to be Death\u2019s finest release, and while I find no fault in any Death album there is much credence to this claim. Human followed the flawless Spiritual Healing that was near death metal perfection in the \u2018dream team\u2019 of Chuck and fellow shredder James Murphy, but the preceding release would prove that Death simply improved with every subsequent release.\n\nThroughout the entire 35-minutes of Human there is no assuaging of emotions, no settling for second banana; Chuck Schuldiner and newly-added guitarist Paul Masvidal traded riffs like men possessed, seemingly rejuvenated and bent on creating a mass hypnosis within tracks like \u201cSuicide Machine\u201d, \u201cVacant Planets\u201d and the Steve DiGiorgio bass-heavy \u201cLack of Comprehension\u201d. What Human represents to the death metal movement is utter respect for detail and attention to quality, traits not too often found in the genre of late. It seems today the easy road is the \u201cKVLT\u201d necro sound which amounts to nothing more than laziness and expedited release dates due to internal concerns, budgetary or otherwise. When Death released an album you knew you were going to get a meticulousness not easily dismissed or fudged. One listen to \u201cCosmic Sea\u201d and any questions are quickly dissolved in a furious onslaught of scales and pinpoint arrangements that set Death above the board in all facets. Lyrically Mr. Schuldiner set the bar somewhere between fantastical journey and deep inner introspection, providing a vehicle of total subservience to the vastness that is our individual psyche, forcing us to think outside our comfort zones. \u201cSee Through Dreams\u201d is the catalyst with which we truly engage ourselves if the mind is so inclined; this piece of intellectual examination is the topical Gibraltar for me. Death is not for the timidity of toe-in-water testing; what you will find here is only to be ingested at full strength of mind and over-estimation of the self and its functionary design. This band is the thinker\u2019s death metal through and through without reservation or equal.\n\nWhen this album first hit the stores I was amazed driving home from the store at how terrific the production was (remember, this was 1991, people) and how fluid the overall sound was. I remember bringing it over to my band practice and playing it for my friends, who worshipped at the Testament altar, and it just seemed lost on them. That should have been a hint right off, but, alas, this helped prove my theory that Death, while wholly illuminating, can also be wildly intimidating to any musician. Therein lay the beauty of Human; the album castrates the expectations of many and inspires and cultivates even more. Suffice it to say, I didn\u2019t bring any band members to see Death live when I saw these blistering tracks performed live twice on the Human tour. What an amazing spectacle they all missed\u2026\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gushed accordingly over all things Human, I\u2019ll get to the Relapse bonus material. As we\u2019ve come to expect with the Sound of Perseverance and Individual Thought Patterns reissues, the bonus disc(s) are chock full of demo material from the respective albums, which is wonderful for musicians and general fans. As a bootleg trader for many years we would have killed for Death rehearsals and demos aside from the early issued releases. That said it does leave room for inquiry as to why Relapse doesn\u2019t include some video footage, possibly a DVD of some concert clips or interviews conducive to the release. I personally know there\u2019s a lot of terrific footage out there from each tour that could easily be cleaned, mastered and heartily gobbled up by ardent, rabid fans like myself. Granted, I understand the legal maneuvering of such additions and I\u2019m delirious with anything Death-related that has yet to be unearthed, but possible inclusion of a DVD for the mail order-only third disc numbered version would be a sweet addition if agreements can be made with fan-footage holders or fellow band members. With this being my only umbrage to take up, I do recommend the mail-order issues for additional demo tracks simply because they are a truly unique gift for long time fans to hear the basic foundations being laid for what would become iconic tracks that serve as respectful testaments for a young man taken far too early and leaves us wondering what might have been.\n\nPregnant with informative liner notes and photos, these Relapse reboots are tremendously valuable for the underground that keeps the Death name going strong, as well it should. If anyone can listen to Death and not find perfection and historical significance throughout I strongly suggest he or she venture out to the local mall and seek out the nu-metal section for the new Decapitated, which assuredly reassembles the tag without benefit of explanation to the uninformed among us.\n\nDeath is the real deal and will forever remain as such. These reissues are an absolute must. \n\n(Originally written for www.MetalPsalter.com)\n",
        "\nLegendary Chuck Shuldiner gathers a group of relatively unknown musicians save for star percussionist Gene Hoglan to deliver the tightest, most complex, and most profound album released ever. The tagline \u2018progressive death metal\u2019 often used to describe this album is a mere overlook of the fine features which overrule it. This album has the ferocity of death metal, lyrical profoundness and complexity of progressive metal, the technical show off of thrash metal, catchiness of power metal, atmosphere of symphonic music, and subtlety of classical music. And all of this is done with such superior and matured musical sense that will put any musician in history to shame. \n\nLet us get this thing straight gentlemen, Gene Hoglan is the drummer, and his drumming is practically out of this world. The complex song writing gives him so much room to breathe and such flexibility with his kit that you sense he probably was suffocating during Time Does Not Heal sessions. His complex timed fills are no less thundering than a raging cyclone and will make Mike Portnoy look like Lars Ulrich. He soars above everyone like a harpy and the listeners are left dazed as he launches complex, odd timed fills after fills in a crescendo that punches through any loop holes in Neil Peart\u2019s drum work. The guitar work of Chuck Shuldiner and Bobby Koelble is no less triumphant than that. From the first second of the album they launch an array of razor sharp, complex riffs that will scythe down hardest of the roman amours. Above all that, is extremely well composed, perfectly executed lead work which varies from being all out shredding to beautiful, melodic, atmospheric pieces which can put any Mozart or Beethoven to shame. The bass adds a nice delicate touch of atmosphere, ambiance and subtlety which is unmatched by any Leif Edling or Ralf Hubert. All of this comes together in a mix which blends all the elements perfectly and gives the album its unique identity.\n\nFrom the very first riff of the album you are transported to an ocean of strong emotions which you like waves. The title track varies from being, mid paced to all out thrash in a matter of moments and the listener is left thunderstruck at the sudden pace changes which are executed razor sharply to perfection. Never does any transition seem forced or too drawn out, all of them flow into each other as serenely as a calm, peaceful stream. Above all, the track is insanely catchy and extremely memorable. The upcoming Zero Tolerance is much more mid paced track which contains an excellent hazy atmosphere till the first chorus and rightly so for the very first riff after the chorus summons destruction right before you. In all this madness you cannot help but feel a false sense of insecurity and yet you will feel peaceful especially due to the magical atmosphere during the chorus. Through the hazy clouds of uncertainty of Zero Tolerance comes the doomy acoustic riff of Empty Words which elevates the tension to the levels of uneasiness. And from the uneasiness springs out anger, which is spilled in the thundering riff which breaks the uncertain silence. Anger and rage reign as the track breaks off at good pace, which refuses to come down. Sacred Serenity is much more epic with dark atmosphere about it, especially during the little break in the middle. The rage of the previous track lowers down and the listener experiences moments of peace and some sense of security, but the musicians have yet other ideas which are clearly showcased in the abrupt ending which again builds up some tension, and forces the listeners to think and wait for what is to come.\n\nChaos and destruction is brought upon in all its forms in the form of 1000 Eyes with its bludgeoning riffs and sharply executed pace changes. The song takes away what little peace the listeners felt and replaces it with pure horror especially during the chorus. Fear and tension exist throughout the track as through the pupils of 1000 eyes, we have the more epic yet hammering, complex and more of a \u2018track-that-forces-you-to-think type\u2019. The listeners themselves cannot fully express the way they feel. The greatest religious epic in the form of the upcoming track, Crystal Mountain, brings back anger, some fear and to a little extent sadness. The lyrics reflect over the listener\u2019s mind, manage to hypnotize him and force him to think over the problems expressed in the song as Schuldiner succeeds in putting a Shakespeare to shame. The thundering percussion reflects upon the mind-set of the listener and also that of the person described in the lyrics. Misanthrope is much more complex with odd time pace changes and brings back the tension of Empty Words and adds rage and anger to it. Perennial Quest brings our journey to an end with complex emotions and feelings flying around you in a whirlwind decorated by odd time pace changes, supreme atmosphere and above the excellence lyrics. The album ends with an excellent acoustic-electric solo which gives a short glimpse of all the emotions that were felt, seen, experienced throughout the album.\n\nThis album is a piece of outstanding musical achievement not only in the realms of heavy metal, but in all the world of music. You name any album or composition in history, and this album would at least give a tough fight. The subtly composed music, backed up by lethal and tight execution, and decorated with lyrics that force you to think about a hundred times after you listen to this album, is something which does not just spring up every day. In all the complex technical madness, you cannot help but feel all the things they right about. In the beastly inhuman screams of Schuldiner you will feel love, hate, fear, sadness, tension, anger no matter how much cold-hearted you may be, and that is the beauty of this album. Should you buy this album? The answer to this question may be the question, are you a human being? And if you are one, this album is a must listen for you.\n",
        "\nHad there been any words lacking in eulogy for Chuck Schuldiner and Death in the metal world I sure hope to have filled a few of them in when recently reviewing the rerelease of their final album, \"The Sound Of Perseverance\", but much is the story the same now with the rerelease of their 1991 masterpiece, \"Human\". After setting early death metal benchmarks with \"Scream Bloody Gore\" and \"Spiritual Healing\", \"Human\" saw Schuldiner, surrounded by entirely new bandmates, take death metal to technical levels never yet seen and from which today the genre is still in heavy gratitude.\n\nTo my mind this record must be in the collection of anyone who dares label themselves a death metal fan, but for newcomers and those who've slipped through the net this re-mastering is your chance to catch up. Eight songs of immense musicianship and, for the large part, blistering speed, create an intense listen which from opener \"Flattening of Emotions\" and through \"Together As One\", \"Lack of Comprehension\" and beyond showcase a band who patently are prodigiously talented and not merely relying to relying on studio tricks to suggest so: exotically fluid solos compete with flexible bass lines, sensational drum patterns and some of the most thoughtful lyrics on any death metal release one is ever likely to hear. Arriving at a time when Atheist, Pestilence and Cynic (of whom Paul Masdival and Sean Reinert performed here on guitar and drum respectively) were all also laying down the law in technicality, as best evidenced on \"Human\" these bands were not relying on lengthy, proggy tracks to make their point or insane Meshuggah-esque time signature changes but the mere interaction of their standard instrumental line-ups and an ear for creating drama in their music - just check out the soloing in \"Together As One\" or \"Vacant Planets\", or the atmospheric interlude of \"Cosmic Sea\" for confirmation. Worthy of mention is the re-mastering job conducted here, which has brought the drums and bass further to the forefront while increasing the overall clarity of the record, exposing new elements to even well-worn listeners of \"Human\" like I.\n\nBy way of extras we have some interesting liner notes written by Paul Masdival and producer Jim Morrison recalling the recording process, an unexpectedly rocking cover of Kiss' \"God of Thunder\" and on disc two a veritable plethora of instrumental studio and demo tracks - a whole 20 infect. More for the die-hards those, they do however tell a similar tale to the bonus skeletal tracks that accompanied the recent rerelease of Control Denied's \"The Fragile Art of Existence\" by way of showing their construction and intense composition.\n\nIn the years that followed Death continued on their path of technicality in travelling further from their extreme background, however on \"Human\" they reached a pinnacle while still resolutely death metal in essence. \"Human\" is an utterly essential milestone in the history of the genre that could conceivably be reckoned as the all-time greatest. Do not less this top-notch reissue pass you by. \n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nWell now that Death has successfully created the greatest death metal album ever, they put out \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d. I gotta say, this album is amazing. Not as amazing as \u201cLeprosy\u201d but it\u2019s still extremely good. Better than a lot of death metal at the time. Death was still in their straight forward death metal phase, sure they progressed a little from \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d and \u201cLeprosy\u201d, but this album is still straight death metal. They hadn\u2019t yet gotten into the \u201cIndividual Thought Patterns\u201d yet or even the \u201cHuman\u201d phase yet, so this album is very high in the Death discography. \n\nSo the production is sort of a step up from \u201cLeprosy\u201d. Everything sounds cleaner but that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. This album still sound very raw but it lacks the rawness that their second album pulled off so well. The guitars aren\u2019t as powerful but are still pretty heavy. The drums are well-produced but Bill Andrews is still playing them so they are lacking in the playing department but they still get the job done as far as death metal goes. The bass, when you can hear it, actually sounds awesome. It\u2019s really low but it\u2019s just TOO QUIET! Chuck\u2019s vocals are as usual pretty much perfect but his screams seem to have to weird effect on them and they seem to echo a lot. \n\nThe song writing has progressed to some degree. The riffs are getting more technical but still maintain the old school Death attitude. One great thing about this album is that there is no more Rick Rozz solos. I think they fit \u201cLeprosy\u201d pretty well but some of them are just annoying. On this album both guitarists are amazing, so amazing that I can\u2019t the solos apart from which are Chuck\u2019s and which are James'. This is a pretty amazing accomplishment from James considering Chuck was one of the best. Bill Andrews did the best he could I guess. The drumming is a small step up from \u201cLeprosy\u201d; he seems to vary it up a little more but still not a big enough difference to really notice it. His fills are a little better but he still relies too much on his snare. His double bass is used about the same. I\u2019m glad he at least tried to do something different. Terry Butler pretty much stayed under the radar. I don\u2019t think he has one part where he shines at all. I mean, I like death metal with the bass loud, it adds to the heaviness of the album and unfortunately for Terry, he really let me down on this one. If you ever wanna hear a shred of bass from this guy, you gotta listen REALLY closely. \n\nThis album has all the aspects you could hope from old school Death. Speed, heaviness, excellent vocals, and amazing guitar work. If you\u2019re expecting b-horror movie lyrics, you will be disappointed. Most of the lyrics on this album are kind of all over the place. Some of them are about death (\u201cKilling Spree\u201d) but not really any mention of blood or guts. Some talk of the human mind come into play (\u201cDefensive Personalities\u201d and \u201cWithin the Mind\u201d) which is expected if you have heard \u201cHuman\u201d. I think this is really the album where Chuck abandoned his gore and death roots and went to the full-on spiritual and human lyrics. \nIf you are looking a mixture of old school Death with a tiny bit of new Death, this album is perfect. I prefer old school Death and this album delivers for me. Highly recommended if you like old Death or new Death.\n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cDefensive Personalities\u201d, \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d, and \u201cLow Life\u201d\n",
        "\nTo me, \u201cHuman\u201d officially marks the death of the old Death. It\u2019s when Chuck decided to step out of the death and gore stuff and move on to different subjects such as the human mind, spiritualism, and society issues. \n\nThis album progresses musically and lyrically but this is still an old school death metal album. \nChuck really began to step up the technicality of his riffs. Not just fast all the time like most of the older stuff. He changes it up a lot on this album; although a lot of it is still fast. His solos have gotten better but they were amazing even on \u201cSpiritual Healing\u201d, so he can\u2019t really improve on something that is already near perfection. \n\nI\u2019m so glad Chuck finally got rid of Terry Butler and Bill Andrews. Terry Butler literally did nothing with the bass when he was in the band. The legendary Steve DiGiorgio replaced Terry and thank God he did. Steve actually does something with the bass! I just wish he was louder in the mix on this album. He does have a few standouts like the beginning of \u201cLack of Comprehension\u201d. Now for the drums, I\u2019ve noticed on almost every single \u201cLeprosy\u201d review someone mentioned how terrible the drummer was. I thought he did good for true old school death metal with little or no progression in the mix. Now with the natural progression happening on this album, I\u2019m glad Bill was let go. Sean Reinert does an excellent job. His double bass is fast, his fills are amazing, and he is just an all around good death metal drummer. \n\nThe songs have progressed but still qualify as old school death metal in my opinion. They are fast and they are extremely heavy. Also, Chuck sounds almost as evil as he did on the previous albums so that just adds to death metal feel. \u201cLack of Comprehension\u201d starts with an awesome almost elevator music type intro and then goes into a masterpiece. It also probably has the most headbangable part in history. \u201cTogether as One\u201d starts out extremely fast and is pretty fast throughout and has a pretty awesome chorus. \u201cCosmic Sea\u201d is the instrumental on this album and is very atmospheric. It has some pretty sweet bass playing and just has a very eerie feel to it. Every song on here delivers good death metal. My least favorite would have to be \u201cSee Through Dreams\u201d because it just doesn\u2019t stick with me after I listen to it. \n\nProduction is near perfect. The guitars are insanely heavy. The drums sound amazing. The only complaint I have is the bass. With Steve now playing bass for them, one would think they would have turned it up to put a spotlight on how talented this guy was but no, he kind of sits in the background with a few exceptions. \n\n\u201cHuman\u201d is a very good death metal album and every song on here is good; some much better than others. It just doesn\u2019t measure up to \u201cLeprosy\u201d or Spiritual Healing\u201d. Those two albums pretty much put everything else to shame. I would highly recommend this album if you like the old Death or the newer Death. \n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cLack of Comprehension\u201d, \u201cSuicide Machine\u201d, and \u201cTogether as One\u201d\n",
        "\nWhen I heard about the debate over Possessed and Death\u2019s debuts, which one was the first true death metal album? I think it\u2019s easy, Death. Scream Bloody Gore is what death metal is to me. Guttural vocals, insane screams, fast riffs, fast drums, gore lyrics, and the whole horror image. \n\nFor death metal, 1987 is pretty much as early you can get when for full lengths. And even when you look back through demos, Mantas was playing death metal sine 82\u2019 \u2013 83\u2019. So in my mind Chuck deserves the title of father of death metal. And with SBG he really set the standard. Although he expanded the genre even more with \u201cLeprosy\u201d, I still feel like this album is pure death metal. \n\nThe vocals really set the standard for death metal. Chuck had his own very unique style of singing. His vocals on this album are pretty guttural. Not Chris Barnes guttural but just deep. When you compare them to \u201cLeprosy\u201d they are much deeper and his screams are as if he is being stabbed to death. These vocals were before bands like Autopsy and Cannibal Corpse went really guttural. \n\nThe riffs on this album are heavy and fast. Not as technical as their later work but hey, this is primitive death metal. The production is raw. The guitars aren\u2019t very heavy. There\u2019s just not much distortion on them. You can take this as good or bad, I prefer more distortion when I listen to death metal but this is the very first death metal album so I understand. The bass is LOUD; you can hear it pretty much the whole album. The drums sounds good, the bass drum is loud and the snare never falls behind everything else. \n\nOne of the very few negative things I can say about this album is that there really isn\u2019t that much variety in the drumming. Chris Reifert is a good drummer, and I don\u2019t blame him for this problem on this album. There is a lot of thrash going on here. The drums are almost always playing fast. He does do some nice double bass every now and then but not enough to give it more of a change. \n\nFor being the first death metal album, \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d is extremely good. It deserves its place in metal history and if you don\u2019t own it, I feel bad for you.\n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d, \u201cRegurgitated Guts\u201d, and \u201cSacrificial\u201d\n",
        "\nDeath is and will always be the greatest death metal band that ever existed in my book. So what did they do the follow up on the gory \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d? With the almost as gory piece of perfection known only as \u201cLeprosy\u201d. Chuck really perfected the death metal formula with this album and this album will forever be held in my heart as the greatest death metal album ever recorded.\n\nAs soon as you turn it on and hear \u201cLeprosy\u201d you notice a huge difference in the production. SBG had a very thin guitar sound. This album really stepped it up in all areas. The guitars are heavy. The drums are loud and the snare is extremely loud. The bass is kind of quiet but is still audible almost the whole time. The vocals are Chuck\u2019s best performance. It sounds kind of like he\u2019s about to vomit on the mic which is a very good thing if you think that\u2019s an odd way to describe an amazing vocal performance. His high screams are still here but not nearly as \u2018being stabbed to death\u2019 as SBG. \n\nChuck was and will always be one of the greatest writers in death metal. Every riff on this album is good. They are pretty technical considering this is primitive death metal. The drums play fast a lot of time but have much more variation than on SBG. Bill Andrews receives a lot of flak for being \u201cone dimensional\u201d but I think he did an amazing job. What people have to realize is that death metal was still a pretty new concept at the time this was released in 1988. There is only so much you can do with these types of insane riffs that most people hadn\u2019t heard yet. \u201cOpen Casket\u201d is easily the best song on here and probably the best song ever made. This has Chuck\u2019s best vocals by far. He goes pretty deep at some points on this album and especially that song. Just listen to where he says \u201cnever to return\u201d; you\u2019ll see what I mean. \n\nThe lyrics are still death related. With some mention of guts and gore that would be expected from Death. Not nearly as b-horror movie like SBG. You can see that Chuck was getting ready to abandon his gore roots after hearing this album. They are death related but more mature in presenting them. \nThis album is a huge step up from their debut and much more primitive than their next album. If you want SBG with better production, better vocals, more variety, and just an all around amazing album, get this. \n\nBuy it, it is just flat out amazing.\n\nBest tracks \u2013 \u201cOpen Casket\u201d, \u201cForgotten Past\u201d, and \u201cPull the Plug\u201d. Well every song is amazing but those are the most amazing\n",
        "\nSure, the production on this demo sucks. It's muddy as hell, there are very noticable volume changes at random places, it skips, the solos are hard to hear, the drums are hard to hear, (save for the toms, which are pummeling) the vocals are quiet, oh, and did I mention it's staticy? Yeah...this demo is somewhere between 50 to 65% static! Some may be turned off by this rather unfortunate aspect of this significant death metal release, but to me, it gives it at strong, ancient atmosphere. The vocals sound like a zombie chanting eternally in some lost cave somewhere, while the drums sound like the beating winds of hell, and the guitars grind and cruch along, sounding like a continent suddenly broke in two!\n\nBut, fear not! The riffs are still discernable! And goddamn, did Chuck Schuldiner have some killers up his sleeve so early in his career! This release focuses mostly on tremelo picked riffing (save for \"Reign of Terror\", which has a Mercyful Fate vibe to it), which ranges from slightly melodic (the chorus of \"Corpsegrinder\") to completly and utterly evil (\"Slaughterhouse\"). As well, this release features one of the three instrumental tracks Death would ever perform, called \"Zombie Attack\". It opens with an eerie clean guitar riff before a mammoth thrash riff explodes into the song. It's simple but effective.\n\nThat's the phrase I'd use to define this album. Simple, but effective. The songs are not filled to the brim with riffs, though the more minimalistic approach gives off a fun vibe to the album that few bands have managed to match in this particular genre. The vocals, performed by Kam Lee, are a far cry from Chuck Schuldiner's guttural, frothing-at-the-mouth gurgles, resembling more or less zombie-like shouts, though they work well with the thrashy vibe of the music and serve as a primitive, yet effective blue-print for today's death metal grunt. \n\nThe sole true problem here concerning the music would be the song-writing. It's fairly obvious here that Chuck Schuldiner had not yet become the songwriting genius he would later be, cranking off two, maybe three good, but not very memorable guitar riffs per song, while the drums blast away and the vocals are content in grunting along without consequence into the depths of hell. However, this is not to say that you can't plainly see the band's potential and the genuine emotion that Death has always had, even in this early, early, early release. \n\nI'd suggest this album to Death fanboys only, or to people genuinly interested in how old school death metal evolved into becoming it's own little slice on the pizza of evil. If you like good, polished production in your death metal, definatly stay away from this album and buy some Vital Remains instead!\n",
        "\nLive in Eindhoven was released only a few weeks after Live in L.A. (Death & Raw), so presumably this was also used to generate some funds for Chuck's ongoing struggle with cancer. There is a DVD for this also (I believe one for its predecessor too), so I will immediately recommend that everyone interested just focus in on that and skip the audio only release, since there is just not much value to it coming so close after the other release. Still, if you were all for funneling the money to the ailing musical legend, it would be something purchased sight unseen strictly for the assistance it was providing. Hell, even if Nuclear Blast wasn't giving him a large share of the proceeds, he was at least getting the usual percentage and royalties, right?\n\nThe problem is that this Dynamo Open Air gig has the same lineup and same general track list as found on Live in L.A. (Death & Raw). The difference is that \"Lack of Comprehension\" and \"Flattening of Emotions\" have been included, and the following removed for the shorter set: \"Zombie Ritual\", \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", \"Empty Words\", and the title track from Symbolic. It's not much of a better set, though they fuck around with the finale \"Pull the Plug\" less than the other live album, and I felt that the sound quality here was evenly balanced, if still pretty raw and lacking. The vocals are a tad less grating, the guitars and drums better mixed, and I can hear the bass lines better even when the dual axes are sounding off. In all, I felt a fraction of more potent excitement than I did listening through the other, but I have to question its overall use when we'd just been bombarded with such a similar product.\n\nWhat would have been excellent would have been if the band and labels had dug through the band's history and given us a CLASSIC live album from the Ultimate Revenge 2 years, or an earlier tour. Surely there were a wealth of bootlegs and soundboard recordings to cull from? Now that would have been something, offering the fans two choices: a modern lineup and an old school rendering. I would have plunked the money down on that instantaneously, and I'm sure others would have appreciated the same. In the end though, this is just another release you're going to snatch up to support the artist as opposed to expecting much throughput of the content, and in this case it's safer just to grab the DVD so you're getting the video component.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nRemaining objective about an album like Live in L.A. (Death & Raw) can be a difficult thing for me While I don't care for the album itself due to the rather miserable track listing, it was released for a decent cause (to help Chuck Schuldiner raise proceeds for his fight with brain cancer) and has at least an audible production which is accurate to the band's performances during this period. It's one of those rare cash grabs which is actually for a GOOD reason, but at the same time it offers fans a long awaited, official live offering. Kudos to Schuldiner for not taking advantage of his rabid fan base many years earlier. He could have released a live album every six months since 19991 and devotees would have gobbled each up like starving robins on a trail of bread crumbs.\n\nAs its title implicates, Death & Raw was recorded on the West Coast in December of 1998, when Death was a few months out from The Sound of Perseverance, touring with that lineup (Hamm, Christy, and Clendenin). Unfortunately, this means its heavy on newer material, as we had yet to reach the point where classic metal bands focused on their classics (though for a handful of the faithful, you'd think Perseverance was the Second Coming). It's not all that bad, there are but three new tracks in the set: \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", \"Spirit Crusher\" and \"Flesh and the Power It Holds\", but I must say I got nothing more from them than I had on the studio album. Symbolic is more thoroughly represented, with \"Crystal Mountain\", \"Zero Tolerance\", \"Empty Words\" and the title track; while Individual Thought Patterns and Human each get a pair (\"The Philosopher\", \"Trapped in a Corner\", \"Suicide Machine\", \"Together As One\"). Sadly this leaves only two slots in the 13-track list to cover the first three fucking albums! Yes, the classic DEATH metal albums are represented only by \"Pull the Plug\" (Leprosy) and \"Zombie Ritual\" (Scream Bloody Gore). A damned travesty, and I don't care how 'forward thinking' Chuck was, Spiritual Healing is completely absent!\n\nThat's a pretty big gripe when wants to experience excitement through a live recording, but recognizing the fact that Schuldiner probably wasn't interested in the least in his older material, I guess I should be happy that even those two made the cut. Or, I would be, if they sounded the least bit entertaining. Chuck was using his more torn throat vocals by this point, sounding almost like a black metal rasp, and it simply does not sound fluid with the formative songs, or even \"Suicide Machine\". The least affected tracks are those from Symbolic, which are more melodic and sparse enough to bear the shift in his tone; or The Sound of Perseverance, since the vocals sounded similar in the studio. As for the rest of the mix, its raw and functional, but nothing special at all. The drums are rather loud and poppy, and the guitars felt too compressed and distant, though the leads carry through decently. I've already mentioned the vocals, and they sound a bit hacked, and Clendenin's clunky bass lines rarely stand out against the guitars.\n\nLive albums are supposed to be the next best thing to being there, and I can't accurately claim that Death & Raw provides this experience. It's by no means an awful recording, but it leaves much to be desired, more like a glorified bootleg than a legendary live. The 'raw' in the title is no joke, but neither does it benefit Death's sound. As a token of appreciation for one of your icons, to help him battle his life threatening illness, it was worth the coin. You were getting something in return for your labors, a positive idea all around. But as a standalone live release, it just does not cut it, and I found little to no satisfaction in the content itself.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nSince I seem to have survived the rash of stabbing and car bombing attempts that surrounded my lukewarm reception to Death's well regarded 1991 effort Human, I must once again cast myself into the maw of reckless endangerment by discussing the band's final studio effort, The Sound of Perseverance. I admit to some exaggeration here, because this is perhaps the most divisive of Schuldiner's albums among the general populace, but like Human, I've known numerous individuals who consider it to be some unquestionable pinnacle of musical achievement (individuals, who, in my humble opinion, clearly need to listen to quite a broader range of output before speaking such lies). At its very best, The Sound of Perseverance is a weak admixture of the past three full-lengths. At its worst, its ridden with underwhelming thrash rhythms, competent but forgettable leads, and a mediocre cover song that shows where Chuck's thoughts were TRULY at when he decided to unleash this about the audience.\n\nThose ruminations were already several cups deep in the planning of Control Denied, a side project in which Schuldiner was highly excited, for which he had written a humdrum hybrid of power and progressive metal. The Sound of Perseverance is really just a bridge spanning the possibilities between the poles of Symbolic and The Fragile Art of Existence, which he wanted to get out of the way before moving his attention to that newer outlet. As was the Death tradition, he wrangled up a new lineup for the experience, this time, entirely (even Hoglan took a break). He brought in his Control Denied co-conspirators Shannon Hamm (guitar), Scott Clendenin (bass) and Richard Christy (drums), all competent enough in their roles. In particular, Christy kicks up a storm here. I could seriously just turn off the vocals and guitars and listen to the man batter away. His dynamics are one of the few components of this album that prevent it from the status of a stupefying bore.\n\nOtherwise, it's mostly business as usual. The same thin, punchy processing of guitar tone that was present upon Human, Individual Thought Patterns, and Symbolic. The same inherent level of variation throughout the song structures. The same taut expression of glimmering, spiral leads and muted melodic patterning. Only this time, there is a dearth of inspiration. Not a single song on this album is fit to shine the loafers of even the weakest fraction of Symbolic. Tracks like \"Flesh and the Power it Holds\", \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", \"Story to Tell\" are all bloated masses of familiarity, stringy progressive death cycling through a wealth of tempos and tribulations, but falling well short of riffs that I'd ever want to hear again. The jangling grooves that inaugurate \"A Moment of Clarity\" seem curious at first, but the song soon devolves into a mire of pernicious ruin, offering not even the slightest step beyond the studio precedents. And you can forget about there being even one single 'evil' riff drawn from the cauldron of the band's grisly past, a feat that even the other 90s efforts were capable of pulling off.\n\nBut there are two further aspects of The Sound of Perseverance that ensure its position at the bottom rung of this band's career ladder. The first is that Chuck's vocals had become incredibly feline and bitchy throughout this album, almost like a little girl. It's the same general direction as he'd been moving towards through the previous decade, but somewhere between 1995 and 1998 the guy's bluejeans must have been pulled all too tight. It occasionally borders on the black metal rasp prevalent throughout that scene, only more 'emotional', if that makes sense. He sounds like the teamster boss for a union of kittens, crying over sour milk. Takes a bit of getting used to, and as the music does little for me as it stands, I do not intend on getting used to them. And then we come to the unfortunate cover of Judas Priest's \"Painkiller\", which I suspect is Chuck testing the waters for Control Denied more than anyone might have thought at the time, even though it's a bonus track, supposedly just here for fun. Not a bad choice, mind you, but Death fails to evoke anything interesting in its execution, just a clinical walkthrough, only the leads have been dried out and fall flat on their asses next to the Downing/Tipton originals, which soared.\n\nIf I had to pick just one song on The Sound of Perseverance that I immediately feel no urge to skip past, it would have to be \"Bite the Pain\", and only because it sounds like a Symbolic outtake. The dodgy bass in the bridge, and the choppy mutes that accompany the lead around 2:00 are the only value I've ever gotten from the album in over a decade, aside from Christy's percussion. Even the lyrics are weak, if not thoughtless. This all feels like a massive step sideways and back, a peripheral voyage to Individual Thought Patterns or Symbolic that forgot to pack all the good music into its cargo hold. The Sound of Perseverance makes Human shine in comparison. Hell, even the Control Denied full-length has more to offer, and since this would turn out to be Death's swan song (Chuck sadly succumbing to brain cancer in 2001 after a long struggle), it seems even more a disappointment in retrospect. The album isn't complete shit, but to these ears it felt wholly anticlimactic after Schuldiner had managed to sharpen the 'second phase' of Death to a razor-fine edge with the previous two releases.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWell, a fact that many metal heads forget sometimes is that heavy metal and all of its countless subgenres are music. If I think of \"Symbolic\" as merely a heavy metal album, I would have to rate it with a 315%. So, I'm going to review this as a work of music.\n\nFirst of all, it's not like this is a standard death metal all-out attack. This band had nothing to prove. They stood, they still stand and they will forever stand among the top of the top heavy metal bands that have existed. \"Symbolic\" is a monster of an album. The songs flow flawlessly one after the other and the whole album sounds like a symphony. Some certain parts might resemble each other, but, what did you want? Some parts of Beethoven's 5th Symphony also resemble each other, does it make the Symphony itself a bad work of art? The answer is no. So be it with \"Symbolic\".\n\nDon't expect a track-by-track presentation on this one. It would take me a month to describe each song and I honestly don't think that words are enough. If you want a highlight, I can say that my personal choice would be \"Crystal Mountain\". But tommorow it could be \"Symbolic\" or \"Without Judgement\", so if you want me to propose something, I suggest that you buy this album so that you can form an opinion on your own.\n\nI don't know if one could consider this to be technical death metal, but the technical part is there the way I want it to be. Don't expect the ultra-speed face-melting uber blast beats, the drumming is more jazz influenced and so is the whole album's structure. And, I could say that even the fast spots are in a strange way emotional. Indeed, what else would it be with Gene Hoglan (ex-Dark Angel, ex-Testament)? Kelly Conlon (ex Monstrosity) gives a feeling of fullness to the songs, with basslines which exist in total harmony with the general flow of the melodies songs in their entirety. The guitar work is really close to perfect. This band knows where it's at and they don't make use of 3 minute long guitar showdowns, instead build up on intelligent melodies. Chuck's solos are emotional as always and reflect a wide variety of musical influences. Also, his vocals are somewhat higher than, say, in Leprosy. They are definitely perfect though, most of the times you can understand what Chuck is saying. Let me add that this album in a way reminds me of At the Gates' \"Slaughter of the Soul\", which is also a masterpiece. However, \"Symbolic\" is way more advanced than \"Slaughter...\" in terms of composition complexity.\n\nOverall, you must not expect anything specific from Symbolic, because you will probably get disappointed. Maybe words are really poor to describe this music. This is not death metal. This is Death metal. Chuck Schuldiner was not just a key-figure in heavy metal, he was a key-figure in musical history.\n\nIf you don't own this, buy it right now. It deserves it. You deserve it.\n",
        "\nHaving showed a marked improvement in the band's progressive, sophomore decade, Individual Thought Patterns was substantial enough that I took the stick out of my ass and came to terms with where Death was headed for the future: the car wash. Symbolic is the third and most potent work of this phase in Schuldiner's career, and yet its remarkable less complicated than its predecessor. In fact, I often have a difficult time describing this as a 'death metal' album whatsoever. It's more like a clinical, hard hitting thrash album with dynamic drums, savvy leads, and the development of Chuck's voice into a slightly pinched, higher range that was not exactly unexpected after hearing Human or Individual Thought Patterns.\n\nThis is honestly the least interesting of Death's efforts from a conceptual standpoint. The lyrics continue along the social and psychological strata the band had been exploring for the past half decade, further removed from the morbid ministrations of their formative gore stores. Much of the composition here is incredibly simple, but damn if it doesn't sound great on headphones or erupting out of just about any stereo I play it through. Jim Morris did a remarkable job here, as well as the mastering team. The guitars feel rich and fulfilling despite only a mild margin from those of Human, and the writing gives the Gene Hoglan plenty of room to breathe. I found myself paying attention to his kicks and fills more than almost anything else I've heard him play on. Rounding out the band this time, Schuldiner decide to go with a pair of lower profile musicians: Bobby Koelbe on the guitar and Kelly Conlon on the bass. Regardless, the duo are rather well suited into this game of musical chairs, complementary to the actions of the star percussionist and composer.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that most of the songs are quite good, with a few in particular numbering among the best of their 90s stint and arguably their career. \"Without Judgement\" is incredibly well plotted, with some thrashing grooves in the verse not unlike \"In Human Form\", surviving a wealth of variation, including the resonant, penetrating leads in the bridge. \"Crystal Mountain\" has a strong charging aesthetic that cedes into subdued, catchy bass lines and glittering strings of cleaner tone, with a jamming mystique to its closing moments. Closer to their work on Leprosy and Spiritual Healing, we have \"1,000 Eyes\"; and \"Misanthrope\" builds memorable momentum, with subtle and fetching chord progressions throughout the verse.\n\nI'm not sure that the epic 8+ minute finale \"Perennial Quest\" is the strongest example here, as I tend to zone out through a number of the transitions; and \"Symbolic\" itself is not an incredibly entertaining opener for the effort, but the remainder of the songs (\"Zero Tolerance\", \"Sacred Serenity\" and \"Empty Words\") are all a study in polished contrasts of surgical aggression and accessible prog rock leads. To tell the truth, there are probably only a half dozen rhythms or individual guitar riffs on the entirety of Symbolic that are revelatory in quality, much less than any of the first three albums when Death were performing their more grisly fare. Hell, there are less standout riffs probably than Individual Thought Patterns. Yet the arrangements are almost unanimously excellent, balanced and all too easy to get lost in, not to mention accessible.\n\nI will gladly bear the banner of dissent when it comes to the majority stance on Death's catalog, vastly favoring the years of Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy to anything that has come since, because those albums created a creepy, unforgettable presence with amazingly cool riffs that simply have never been replaced in the genre that they helped birth. But there can be no doubt that the philosophical prose, progressive influence and friendlier, bring home to mom gloss of Death 2.0 was slowly ascending the ladder of quality, to peak upon Symbolic and then fall off dramatically with the anticlimactic drivel that was The Sound of Perseverance. Schuldiner was bent on expanding his work into a cross-stream that could taken be taken seriously by fans of rock, thrash, and subscribers to guitar magazines. Here was a way to do it without sacrificing quality nor intelligence. The last Death worth a damn.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nAs much as I wish I might have sawed off and cauterized Chuck Schuldiner's legs around 1989, then kept him locked in a basement prison on a diet of human entrails and cheap horror films, there was simply not going to be any looking back for the Florida musician as he set his ambitions and aspirations anew for each full-length effort. That aside, the man definitely worked upon plateaus of creativity, rather than steep peaks and gorges, and the majority of his output consisted of two primary 'trilogies' or phases (excepting The Sound of Perseverance, which I'll likely complain about at great length elsewhere). Individual Thought Patterns represents the 'bridge' edition of the second trilogy, refining the concepts behind Human by extrapolating better songs from their nebulous midst.\n\nSure, many lavish such praise upon that fourth disc that one might think it was an evolutionary stopgap in human existence, but it takes only a single track from its successor to stifle such a misrepresentation, the all too aptly titled \"Overactive Imagination\". Here we experience all of the processed sterility of the 'New Death' of the 90s, sculpted into a more durable, memorable pattern of notes alternated between the jerkiness of the verse and the scalding momentum of its transitions. Schuldiner had once again acquired new musicians to help mold his visions: Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal of Cynic replaced with King Diamond stalwart Andy La Rocque and thrashing thunder god Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel, World Wars I and II, the battle of Ragnarok, etc). Both get to work quite early here, with Hoglan's strength granting the recording a more formidable backbone than Death had ever possessed in the past, and LaRocque's considerable lead skill grafting a warmth and immortality to the solos here that simply crush those of Human.\n\nRetained here: Steve DiGiorgio, who it turns out is the perfect counterweight to the new duo and Chuck's meticulous dynamic sensibility, fingers strutting along the fat strings as if their own existence were dependent on it. From \"Overactive Imagination\" we shift unto the more glorious \"In Human Form\" with its arching, credible verse patterns that cede to the most 'death metal' riff on the album at :40, adjoined to a beautiful, eerie solo. So far, Individual Thought Patterns has proven just as enduring as the 1990 effort Spiritual Healing, but will the good fortune hold? Yes and no. For the most part, the material here is heavily front-loaded, and I've long held the first four tracks to be the best of the litter, including the acrobatic variation of \"Jealousy\" with its thick streams of bass and the majestic climes of the bridge; and the provocative \"Trapped in a Corner\" for the progressive, spacey fusion burrowed in its depths, very much a reflection of what the band had sought out to achieve with Human.\n\nFor the rest, I feel it's quite possible to pick out a few strengths and leave the remainder on the cutting room floor. \"The Philosopher\" is perhaps the best known of its tracks, having boasted a grim video and a rollicking, rolling mosh ethic in its verse that had limbs flying about on the band's touring, but I've never considered it incredibly memorable. I enjoy the business and the atmospheric elements of \"Mentally Blind\", but despite its diversity, it reeks of 'kindly get to the damned point'. \"Destiny\" offers us a tranquil 30 seconds of calm before it folds into the clutter of aggression, but nothing else of interest really happens until the lead and choppy bridge melodies. I quite enjoy the charging emotions behind the title track. The taut velocity often thrust into \"Out of Touch\". The schizoid glaze of the guitars in \"Nothing is Everything\". None of these are top billing, but they're easily the measure of my favorite Human tracks like \"Suicide Machine\".\n\nNot sure if it's the change in musicians, or simply that Schuldiner was better able to flesh out his ideas for this record, but it's a noted improvement from its stagnant 1991 sibling. A revelation that not all will be lost in this creative transition from the pungent pits of gore to the social consciousness conveyed through the lyrics. This has essentially the same Scott Burns mix as the last album, if marginally more potent (though I would also attribute this to the superior structure of the songs). The songs are not all equally memorable, but the majority have at least something of value within their clinical carapaces. Individual Thought Patterns marks a steady escalation in quality that would persist through the following album, Symbolic, and though I'd never choose this over my beloved Leprosy or Scream Bloody Gore, it'll do in a pinch.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nI've already gone on about Relativity's debauchery with my review of Dark Angel's Decade of Chaos compilation, but the California thrash cult is not the only artist to receive such a worthless tribute in that label's hands after they acquired much of the Combat roster. Naturally, Death would see some exploitation, being that Chuck and company were one of the hottest and better selling acts to make the transfer, and the result is Fate: The Best of Death, an absolute waste of plastic and print that should never have passed through the lips of any womb, corporate or artistic. As you have guessed, this is nothing more than reprinted tracks from the first four albums of the band's catalog, with some added liner notes (gee thanks).\n\nLet's be perfectly blunt about this: Death fans fucking love Death, and by this point unless they were nursing a crack or heroin addiction they had likely accrued the funds, even via a paper route or Saturday morning lawn mowing gig, to purchase all of the band's prior material. Their new home distribution center, Relativity might have realized this and then worked with the band to produce a decent collection. After all, this band had a huge number of demos and rehearsal material leading up to their Combat signing, and a few strings pulled for permission might have netted us some 2xCD set that would be well worth owning. Instead, in some blatant attempt to rob the dregs of naivety, they chose instead to reprint 10 tracks that all but the suckers were already in possession of: \"Zombie Ritual\", \"Mutilation\" and \"Baptized in Blood\" from Scream Bloody Gore; \"Left to Die\", \"Open Casket\" and \"Left to Die\" from Leprosy; \"Altering the Future\" and the title track from Spiritual Healing; and \"Together as One\" and \"Suicide Machine\" from their then-latest, Human. So basically 10/34 of their songs to that point.\n\nIs it an amazingly representative track list? In so far as it contains a fair spread of material that favors the earlier (better) albums, it could be worse. But then, what is the point? Few if any fans of this band had an interesting hovering below pure obsession, and anyone new to their sound would be far more rewarded by pursuing any of their full-lengths than this, even Human which was creating circle jerks among the underground (though I found it a disappointment). This was made for nothing else than filling the coffers and fueling the corporate record industry schema, and it has absolutely zero value to anyone with a grain of sense. Why not just print a greatest hits album for every Death record, with the same track lists mixed up in order of preference by some shill? Could have made four times the money, for four times the garbage. Remastered or not, this sucks. Curse such greasy cash ins and all who support them.\n",
        "\nIn all the years I've listened to metal, through all of its mutations, there are few cases where I've felt so at odds with the 'majority' as with Death's fourth full-length Human. I have a number of friends and acquaintances who honestly feel this is the greatest album of all time. Accolades have been written from here to kingdom come and back again, and in lieu of Chuck Schuldiner's tragic passing it has vaulted into even more of a concrete classic status. I suppose here is the point at which I could just claim that they're all full of shit, that it's some kind of conspiracy, 'Body Snatchers', whine like an infant and then go grab some lunch, but it's not that simple. Because Human does not suck. It is not the product of effortless self-preservation, nor a brain addled deviation of form. It is not crass or commercial. It is not a sell out. And it is not uninspired, nor uninspiring.\n\nWhat it is, is a progression gone awry. A sacrifice of ghastly mood and virtue for ambition. But more importantly, it's a fairly underwhelming piece of music from a band that had to this point been frankly fucking awesome. As early as Leprosy, Death's conceptual motivation (and lyrics) had swerved subtly to a more philosophical standpoint on mortality, which was then brought into social and technological, cultural relevance through Spiritual Healing. In fact, you could see the transition to Human from a mile away. Knowing Chuck's motivations to grow and evolve the terrain of his musical alter ego, it was inevitable. Hints of the sound here were seasoned across Spiritual Healing: a thinner, more processed and by extension less powerful guitar tone, less festering or effective vocal tones, and more frequent flights of instrumental fancy. The 'death' metal that I so loved from the earlier works still survives here, but it's rapidly becoming the subtext of the band's dynamic, rather than its foremost aspect.\n\nWith Scream Bloody Gore I had a bloody good time; Leprosy was a genuinely creepy, beautiful and brutal experience; Spiritual Healing less so, but still had the songwriting that hung out in my skull years later. Human is the first case in memory in which I felt I could surgically extract a few individual riffs and feed the rest as scraps to the hounds. But not only does this album mark a shift in aesthetics, but also in how Chuck would select musicians to work among. In what might seem a fit of abashed elitist snobbery, he had begun a revolving door of musicians here that would continue through the rest of Death's career. Bill Andrews, Rick Rozz and Terry Butler had turned towards the lackluster Massacre with another former Death-ite (Kam Lee); so a bevy of technically fluent individuals had been hired on to 'flesh out' this excursion. Steve DiGiorgio of Sadus for the bass guitar. Cynic members Paul Masvidal and Sean Reinert for the guitar and drum slots. An impressive quartet as far as individual musical proficiency is concerned, a 'Dream Team' like one might send to the Olympics. So then, why does this album supplant the charm of its predecessors which such a dry, mechanical, mediocre sensation?\n\nThankfully, Human does not abandon all of the band's prior assertions. \"Flattening of Emotions\" opens with some tinny sounding muted death and a good number of robotic transitions, spliced in its depths with easily forgotten wanking. I think the only part of this song I enjoyed was the sad current of melody beneath the chorus. \"Suicide Machine\" is better, perhaps the closest this CD gets to what I so loved on the older albums, with a few creepy old school death rhythms (the chorus) and slices of eerie if predictable melodies. Still, though, the notation here is simply not as morbid and memorable as what had come before. I enjoy the driven, death metal break of the \"Together as One\" verse, with DiGiorgio plunking all over it and Reinert as taut and puckered as a newly molded sphincter, but I found myself caring less about any of the remaining riffs here. Ditto for the entirety of \"Secret Face\", which I had entirely forgotten until I dusted off the album to prepare this review.\n\n\"Lack of Comprehension\" is initially promising due to the desperate interaction of vocals and rhythm, but outside of that opening riff and the mosh breakdown at 1:30 with the frenzied guitar accompaniment its like a boring philosophy lecture, and I'd have to say the same for \"Vacant Planets\" and \"See Through Dreams\", with the exception of that epic, melodic swerve at about :50 in the latter. Of course, we also have \"Cosmic Sea\" the first outright instrumental found on the Death studio albums, and probably the one track on this album that I would actually spin the disc for. The guitars create a meandering scar-scape of sadness and beauty, and I enjoy the synthesizer sounds utilized in the backdrop. The leads are impressive, especially when they start warping through wormholes around 3:30, and DiGiorgio also fashions some mesmerizing effects to anchor the cosmic convocation.\n\nAll in all, the tone to this album is arguably its most crippling feature. Scott Burns mixed it, and I'd be lying to say it was one of his finer moments. Razor thin and very much devoid of power. In fact, had this been executed with bolder guitars in mind, and less of a nerdy modernism in the processing of the distortion, the same songs might be somewhat more potent. Not that the actual riffs are exemplary, but they're ironically more mechanistic and less 'human'. Post-human, if you will, as if some band of A.I. infused automata mining Jupiter caught wind of some Spiritual Healing broadcasts and decided to creature a 'spiritual' successor to that album. Hypocritically, I don't mind this diffused digitization so much on the following works Individual Thought Patterns and Symbolic. But only because I like the songs on those records more than these.\n\nI have given Human more second chances, third chances, and twenty seventh chances than almost any other record I own, but each time I return to explore it I am left wanting. I've found the material to also be dull in the stage setting a number of times I've seen the band (once even opening for them at Salisbury Beach where a lot of booked tours came through), though they always compensated with older tunes. I'm certainly not opposed to progression in my music: the two other 'major' prog/jazz/death albums of 1991 sat rather well with me (Unquestionable Presence, Testimony of the Ancients). Human is elegant, and never rushed, but neither is it an exciting listen. It's not the worst of the Death efforts, but I'm simply not hard wired to appreciate it beyond a handful of the riffs and lyrics. To me, the Death I truly loved dissolved the year prior, not that Chuck was ever going to brook a wrench in the gears of his evolving musical landscape, but I wouldn't have been opposed to keep him penned up for a few more DEATH metal albums.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nConceptually, Spiritual Healing feels as if Chuck Schuldiner had emerged from the creepy catacombs of its predecessors, grabbed himself an ice cold lemonade and taken a look around the world for once. The lyrics of this album deal less in the sheer thanatopsis of Leprosy than its present environment, or the plausible technological nightmare scenarios of our shared future. Naturally, this shortens the shadows of morbidity that previously hovered over the writing, and lengthens the band's relevancy against the backdrop of popular thrash metal, but I was quite pleasantly surprised that Chuck could still tear out a truly devious riff or two. This is also what I'd deem the 'Earth' phase for death. No longer was the listener being dragged through the rot infested sub cellars of pestilent horror (which I for one had no problem with), but Schuldiner's ambitions had yet to carry him among the clouds and beyond...\n\nBut first, they would carry him to the mercenary James Murphy, who supplants Rick Rozz here with ease. Terry Butler, while credited on the previous album as bassist, actually performs the instrument here, joining Bill Andrews' steady rock-inclined drumming. You can hear a mild difference in the guitars, armored with more muscular melodies than Leprosy, but I would not say that this is necessarily a technical superior to the sophomore; in fact I didn't often experience the same haunted exhilaration as two years prior. This is yet another Scott Burns mix job, a name that would become synonymous with not only Florida death metal but the scene at large, but as opposed to the uneven sound of Deicide or The Ten Commandments, here he seems spot fucking on. The guitars are a crisp, balanced pair of knives that deliver each surgical spike of brilliance with certainty, and the drums, bass and vocals are all stirred appropriately to carry their weight, without ever sacrificing their individual strengths.\n\nSongs. Death still possessed them in spades, and this is the last of what I'd consider the band's classic, supra-riffing stables. \"Living Monstrosity\" christens the album with a joyous, pummeling curvature, Schuldiner's homage to the crack baby (remember slinging this terminology around as an insult in the late 80s?). There are no less than three incredible riffs buried in some rather comfortable surroundings, the first the rolling bridge leading up the chorus (1:15), the second the doomy breakdown before 2:00 that leads into the swerving, flanged dual melody, and the final being the groove behind the lead directly in the song's center. From there, the album gets even better with the doomed lead-in to \"Altering the Future\", also invested with some excellent death/thrash rhythms; and \"Defensive Personalities\", which ups the riffing ante even further with a concrete fervor, rubble strewn breakdowns and a predictable yet intimidating chorus sequence. Beyond its legendary intro melody, \"Within the Mind\" plods along at a more subdued speed, with some giant groove hooks reminiscent of \"Pull the Plug\", though it's not a favorite.\n\nIn the tradition of having the title track serve as its lengthiest, \"Spiritual Healing\" manages to one up even \"Leprosy\", with nearly eight minutes of content, opening with another fancy piece of tapping (Chuck should be credited with some of the best such sequences in all of extreme metal, to this day). The ensuing barrage is overall pretty solid, but I won't lie, there might be a minute or two of fat here that could be clipped in lieu of the better rhythms. \"Low Life\" transforms from a clinical groove to a number of variations, including a giant doom step around 1:20 that could just have well been a Candlemass riff (it probably was). I love \"Genetic Reconstruction\", the way its brick opening rhythm carries forward to the creepy bridge as Chuck's foul poetry fires off against the practices of cellular surgery, cloning and such. Lastly, there comes \"Killing Spree\", with another of the signature opening sequences that cedes to a pair of excellent mute streams and another of the legendary, propulsive breakdowns.\n\nSpiritual Healing is just not Leprosy for me, nor even Scream Bloody Gore. It's not a pinnacle performance for its time, nor does it stride ahead of the previously established parameters aside from the lyrical content. Ironically enough, once Chuck took such broader steps with Human, I found myself losing some interest. Spiritual Healing might just be the 'safest' album in all of the Death catalog, but it's pretty damn good regardless. The riffs are still impressive and catchy, and the focus remains on accessible rock song structures as opposed to the manifold chaos of what Morbid Angel and Atheist were creating. You have to admire the guy for not caving in to such outside pressures. Schuldiner and most of his troops had no dearth of proficiency on their chosen vessels, but the songs always remained central (even those I didn't enjoy); simplistic enough that they wouldn't be entering the Guinness Book of World Records, but thoughtful and more than capable of sinking hooks into the listener. A few slackers here (\"Within the Mind\", title track) but it's honestly the last nipple-perking Death record before the cosmonaut conditioning.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhere Scream Bloody Gore provided us with a glimpse of corpse strewn genius, it was Chuck Schuldiner's sophomore monstrosity Leprosy that would hammer in the final coffin nails: death metal had truly arrived, and with it an almost entire musical landscape would either book passage on the funeral barge or sink into the Lethe. Sure, thrash had of brilliance yet to offer, and to an extent, many considered Leprosy itself to fall under that category in its day. But as time has proven, it is by far one of the most expressive, beatific statements of brutality and evil that I've ever experienced, and I enjoy it with the same solidarity today as I did over 20 years ago. In fact, I hold it upon the same lofty plateau of carnage as I place a Consuming Impulse, Realm of Chaos, Left Hand Path, or Altars of Madness: a mastery of the genre's fundamentals, with unanimously catchy songs to boot.\n\nYes, I said catchy. Many might forget that the inauguration of death metal was not simply a thing of blunt, indifferent brutality or charnel atmospheres, but actual song craft. Such a large ratio of the genre's rabid followers today came into the fold in the 90s or beyond that I fear many might have taken (or still take) an album like Leprosy for granted. For example, you won't hear excess storms of double bass, blasting or technical drumming here where they're not viable. This was well before the market had been cornered by Cryptopsy or Suffocation. Bill Andrews' beats offer nothing more than a concrete foundation for the wondrous, insanely well written riffs and the thick as thieves bass lines, rolling on his bass drums where applicable. And know what? Nothing more is needed for this album whatsoever, because the star side of beef in this slaughter house is without any doubt the guitar riffing and the caustic vocal torments of Schuldiner.\n\nThey do not make riffs like this anymore, not often at least. Such simple but instantaneously memorable fare that manages to encapsulate the menace and threat of a worldly change for the worse. In today's climate of brickwalled, ProTools brutality, death metal has transformed into an acrobatic light show in which the most gallantly executed tricks are fawned over by brooding masses that forget them once the following weeks upstaging has transpired. But how many are writing a riff that might actually scare the fuck out of you? I mean, no offense to Deeds of Flesh or Behemoth (I enjoy some material by both), but if you were alone in a morgue during a power outage, would you feel terrified if their music started to play in the background? Fuck no you wouldn't. It's brutal, indeed, but it doesn't possess that same skin crawling atmosphere, conjured directly through its notation. You don't feel that instant repulsion as if being covered in spiders, or that wondrous, jaw-dropping disbelief you might have felt when watching human entrails being exhumed from their corporeal hosts by the zombies in an 80s Romero flick.\n\nI feel that sensation every time I listen through Leprosy, for nearly the entirety of its 39 minutes. Even at its most goofy and uplifting (\"Forgotten Past\"), I'd need to hold your hand in the theater when the lights go out. The slow, sure chords of the title track de-Christen the album, dire melodies cycling across Chuck's bass lines before that ineffably damning death howl erupts around :40. Jesus fuck, I feel like I'm staring at my own corpse while cold, dead spectral hands are forcing me backwards into the maw of the underworld. Yet, it's all still catchy, in particular where the guitars cut in before 2:00 and the searing velocity of the riff after that. Not many bands can stop/start you this often and hold your attention. This one could. \"Born Dead\" arrives with almost playful deviance, a gaggle of gremlins and fiends dancing on your hide as they stab it with poisoned barbs, fast and brutal guitars alternating into the escalation of pure chord force in the chorus, and then the clinical tapping sequence after 1:00 which is legendary.\n\n\"Forgotten Past\", as hinted above, is even more playful with an almost happy-go-lucky muted punk veneer to its introductory riff. However, it soon collides into a graveyard wall, and the lower bridge/groove rhythm at 1:00 is a knockout. \"Left to Die\" begins with one of the creepiest riffs on the entire album, a surgical thrashing that feels like you're watching some unfortunate be pumped with formaldehyde while still drawing breath. Big, swaggering grooves cede towards another of those glorious, thick rhythms, and I dare you not to explode at the chorus, one of the most tangible and enduring statements of DEATH METAL to date. \"Pull the Plug\" follows, one of the most popular pieces from this sophomore, another smorgasboard of splatter and horror with at least 5 unforgettable riffs, and a chorus that has probably broken as many bones in mosh pits as anything else in all of thrash or death (excepting \"Raining Blood\", of course). Listen to that riff at 1:20. That is all I should have to say...\n\nYet Schuldiner, Andrews and Rick Rozz are not finished with us here, and they burst out the meaty, meandering causeway of \"Open Casket\", with another monolithic, almost doom metal breakdown bridging the verses. I particularly enjoy the wild nature of the lead in this one, shrill and cavernous and resonant across the pathological plague-scape of the album. \"Primitive Ways\" has a similar, escalating brightness about it that we were teased with in \"Forgotten Past\", but once again composed front to end with perfect, plausible guitar lines and Chuck's unforgettable, flesh stalking vocals. \"Choke On It\" festers with some of the same, slower breakdown segues that populate other songs here, but is marvelously concise and offers another of the album's most malevolent, genius riffs just before 1:30. All of these are seasoned in a lyrical sauce similar to the debut. Still heavy on simplistic imagery, but more consistently composed.\n\nWe are living in 'old as new' times, folks, with many younger artists turning back to the past for their inspiration. But I'll be damned if I wouldn't pay a band double for an album that made such flawless use of inspiring, simple rhythms; or one that could conjure such morbid malignancy without simply steering towards the cavernous, deep guttural terrain. The production here is perfect, raw but resonating through the listener's mind like an autopsy on the television set. You want to turn away, you want to squint but you're glued to the gore, fascinating by the fleshy flaws and organs that lie within all of us. Leprosy was one of the most repulsive yet alluring metal experiences I was honored to undertake in the 80s, alongside the over the top Slowly We Rot or Cause of Death, or the thrashing unto death transition of Pestilence. It's probably cool in some circles to rally against Chuck from beyond the grave, and my own feelings on Death are mixed once he transformed into a philosophical cosmonaut on the fourth album (half forgetting what got him there in the first place), but I am sure as a starving bear in a spring thaw that this is one of the best goddamn things I've ever heard in my middle-age nearing existence. Leprosy forever. May the limbs of all unworthy poseurs fester in putrid permanence.\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nWhat little more can I possibly add to the legacy of Chuck Schuldiner and Death? Passing well before his time in 2001 at the age of 34 despite the release of 8 brilliant albums (including Control Denied's \"The Fragile Art Of Existence\") his presence is simply wholesome across the death metal landscape and for as long as metal lives the man's presence will forever be sorely missed.\n\nThe final studio release of the Death catalogue, originally out in 1998, is here re-released with a reworked cover, and bonus disc of demo recordings in a similar way to the Control Denied LP recently was. Right the way through from the immense \"Scavenger Of Human Sorrow\" to the Judas Priest \"Painkiller\" cover (by some distance the greatest metal cover I've ever heard) every instance bleeds with the sort of technical ingenuity, passion and song-writing panache that cannot be trained in a musician, such is the natural gift that was bestowed on Schuldiner and the group he assembled around him for this release.\n\nSchuldiner's ability to weave riffs of intricate delicacy around each other to form coherent wholes in \"Bite The Pain\", \"Flesh And The Power It Holds\" and \"Spirit Crusher\" tells of a man constantly pushing at the edge of metal's boundaries, full of the spirit that defines the genre we all love. No less stellar is the performance of rhythm guitarist Shannon Hamm, the bass of Scott Clendenin (who upholds Steve DiGiorgio's work magnificently) and especially drummer Richard Christy, who displays the talent to perform complex beats and fills with ease to produce a drumming performance that rivals the best metal has ever offered.\n\nIf these sound like flattering words and you've not heard \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" then don't be put off after 1 or 2, unfulfilling, listens - my first hearing 8/9 years ago was one of nonplussed intrigue; now, this many years down the line, I'm still discovering little gems hidden amongst the deep layers of this work of art. Whether expressing blistering power and serious headbanging demeanour (\"Scavenger\u2026\") or acute instrumental beauty (\"Voice Of The Soul\") the range of emotions that Death are able to extract from the instruments remains a credit to their craft and sums up why they remain such a key name in heavy metal history. That no current bands sounds akin to this (although Obscura are coming close) is a testament to the unique route Death took in the creation of numerous classic albums (\"Scream Bloody Gore\", \"Human\" and \"Symbolic\" can arguably be rated just as highly), and it seems somewhat tragically fitting \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" should be the act's final album. Perseverance personified over a career impossible to be equalled.\n\nOriginally written for www.Rockfreaks.net\n",
        "\nDeath. \nWith a band name like that, it's no surprise that they got the death metal genre up and running, through the trading of over 20 piss-quality demos in the southern states of USA. They blazed a trail and got bands like Cannibal Corpse (meh) and Autopsy (woot) started. For me personally, Death's 'Leprosy' was the first straight death metal album I got into... not including melodic death metal acts like In Flames and Arch Enemy. I remember seeing the artwork for Leprosy everywhere and hearing the band name mentioned with great pride. \nEventually, I looked for the album, and I got my hands on it. \n\nLet me just say that I have immense respect for Death as a band. I haven't heard the more 'intelligent' Death albums (Symbolic, Individual Thought Patterns, etc) at the time of writing this review, and so I haven't heard Death's super technical riffs and metaphorical lyrics, either, and I can't testify if Death really became an intelligent band or not. But from what I can tell from Leprosy, Death was headed in a great direction. Leprosy is a dark, guttural piece of death metal, full of plenty of memorable riffs, lyrics, and songs. The chorus to the title song has been engrained into my mind. The atmosphere is very grim, and the variety of song lengths and tempos allow the atmosphere to deepen, unlike a lot of death metal bands around the time that just made dinky little two-minute songs that went for speed rather than depth. There are practically no faceless riffs on here, no chugging... but the guitar solos are blatant Kerry-King worship, going for wammy-bar-streaked solos, wild and messy. There is defenitely more form and thought put into the solos than that of Slayer, but only barely. \n\nAnd then there's Chuck Schuldiner, the singer. He has a great, great voice, and he complements the album so well with his guttural shout, and his screamy wails, and he sets himself right into the best extreme metal vocalists I have ever heard. It's always a treat to hear him do an extended scream, without once wavering from the power of his pipes. He has a ton of energy and strength in his voice, and best of all, it's extremely distinctive. I have yet to hear any band that has a vocalist anything like his. He's a great frontman. Extremely unfortunate that this guy died so freaking young. \n\nThe thing I really like about Leprosy in particular is the fact that it doesn't need to resort to balls-to-the-wall speed in order to be heavy. There are plenty of fast parts to satisfy you (they're brought down by the drums, but more on that later), but the album gives you plenty of slow and mid-tempo sections that prevent boredom and make it obvious that Death is quite unique. And don't worry, the album stays agressive and fierce for most of the time, and even the slowest parts don't get tiring. Leprosy also moves away from the typical ghouls n' zombies theme, going for a more morbid line of lyrics that have more of a psychological effect (look at the lyrics to songs like Open Casket and Leprosy) and the whole album comes off as more mature for these reasons. \n\nOkay, now I've gone on for long enough about why this album is awesome. But I'm sure you're wondering why I would give this album a mere 15/20. The answer is simple: THE DRUMMER. \nI loathe that guy. I know Chris Reifert of Autopsy played drums on Death's 'Scream Bloody Gore', and I know Chris Reifert to be a really interesting drummer from hearing Severed Survival. And like I said before, I've also heard one or two songs from Scream Bloody Gore, so I know the drumming was tight and there were a bunch of great fills. I understand that Chuck Schuldiner moved to Florida after recording the album, leaving Chris to his own devices... but I can't for the love of God understand why Chuck would think that this... Bill Andrews guy was a good idea for Leprosy. What was he thinking? This guy can't seem to leave his fucking snare alone. He's always producing the same redundant, boring garbage... especially on the fast parts! There are literally entire songs where this is all he does, and I think it's because he has no other way of keeping up with the rest of the band. What a joke. The only times he decides to do something different is when there's a slow section... Was it really so hard to find a drummer better than this guy? Not only that, but they're SO HIGH IN THE MIX, they're literally just as loud as Chuck Schuldiner's voice. If the drums had been any better, or if they had even been lower in the mix, I would have given Leprosy 17/20. But those drums just bother me SO much... Okay, if you want to know what I'm talking about, listen to 'Forgotten Past'. The drums only vary in tempo, and nothing more. You just hear Bill pounding his snare to death, ('scuse the pun) and I just wish that he would leave the damned things alone for one second so I could hear everything better. There's just no excuse for this guy; he's atrocious. Not only that, but he was on Death's follow-up album Spiritual Healing as well. I don't know if he's any better on it or not, but if he could drag one album down, I'm sure he had the capacity to do it again. \n\nNow, since I happen to have the Century Media digipack of Leprosy, I have the oppurtunity to hear Death playing the big songs off the album live. Chuck's voice is great onstage, and Death really show their guitarwork off here. The solos are great, the live performances are full of energy and enthusiasm, (Pull the Plug especially being played with a ton of entensity and a boosted tempo that sounds great) and it sounds like the band know how to do a great show. The fans are also quite prevalent; they sound extremely enthusiastic (listen to the fans when Death starts playing Left to Die... they're going nuts!) and ready to break their necks moshing. Best of all, the drums are improved. While admittedly there's still a lot of dependence on the snare, it isn't as blatant or annoying, and best of all, it isn't as high in the mix as the studio album. I can also tell that Death must've had some state-of-the-art recording equipment set up, because the production is pretty good. There are a few times when Chuck's voice reverbs quite a bit (they must have been playing on a pretty big stage) but other than that I love the live part of the album. \n\nSo yeah, Death's Leprosy is a great piece of death metal, but the thing that keeps me away from replaying it are the drums, and it pains me to see how much they wrecked what would have been a near-perfect death metal album. Leprosy could have been great, but Bill Andrews had to bring it down. I just wish that someone who is good with sound editing decides to edit out the drums and fill the space with someone who is a competent drummer. If you're a death metal fan of any kind you'll probably be drawn to this album one way or another eventually, but I'm warning you now... THOSE DRUMS ARE SO ANNOYING. If you can listen to it without the drums bothering you, you'll love this album. Full of great riffs, great vocal screams, a grim yet agressive atmosphere, and enough tempo and rythm changes to keep you interested right through. \n\nRecommended songs would be Pull the Plug and Leprosy. Both full of electricity and energy, Leprosy being dark, Pull the Plug being fierce and wild, bearing probably the best solo of the album, and both are highly memorable and catchy.\n\noriginally written for http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/\n",
        "\nLeprosy is an album, that in my humble opinion, is severely misunderstood, and in many respects underestimated. Many people will claim that Death's Spiritual Healing was the real transition for the band, and that Leprosy has few stylistic differences from the Debut. I truly disagree, as the difference between Scream Blood Gore, and the follow-up are like night and day. From the production, to the song structures and techniques, Death has made steady improvement, and I would even go as far as to say that hints of Death's later technical and progressive abilities that made Death so popular in the 90's can be in it's very infancy on this disk. \n\nI was on this album that death decided to not only to vary tempos, but talk about more serous topics than zombies and ghouls. The lyrical content adds perspective, such as the title track, and the outstanding Pull The Plug. Issues concerning mortality and even morality can heard throughout. In addition, I believe that songs like Pull The Plug are Death's first real attempts at more complex passages, and even technicality. Frequent tempo changes, as well as more sophisticated riffs are proof of this. In fact, some parts of not only this song, but several others are not at all unlike what would be hear on Spiritual Healing and beyond, although being much more raw and primal sounding. \n\nWhile I still would not consider this to be full fledge technical material, there are quite of few moments of semi-technical guitar riffs, present in the music on Leprosy, making it obvious that Leprosy was the bands first attempt at a much more serious offering. Still, just like Its predecessor, Leprosy showcases rampaging thrashy death metal, in stark contrast to later, more restrained works, only done which much more skill than before. Even Spiritual Healing sounds like they were holding back in terms of speed, which is the main reason why I have always felt somewhat dissatisfied with much of death's later work; the lack of speed. I'm saying Death is slow, but I believe they would have sounded much better if they would have played at the tempos seen here on albums like Individual Though Patterns. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that this album was the true transitional point for Chuck, and was the first to incorporate features seen on later albums, not spiritual Healing. While just as brutal and as fast as the debut, It has some added complexity, and some moments of semi-technical guitar work. The following album was much to restrained to work, and to me, it wasn\u2019t until their 1993 album that they started to come anywhere close to the speed of their sophomore album. Truth be told, i death would have combined the speed of their early disk, with the complexity of their later works, Death would have been even more amazing than they already are. Sadly, Chuck chose to trade-in thrashing brutality, for complexity alone from this point on instead of mixing the two. While this doesn\u2019t completely satisfy me, I still think Chuck's later material is astonishing and commendable. I just find this album to be the most enjoyable. Death 'till Death!!!!!!!\n",
        "\nThe year is 1998, when front man Chuck Schuldiner decided to release his last album under the name of Death. He would continue on with the band Control Denied which sounded even more melodic than Death. The general consensus of all Death albums is that the first few were unadulterated death metal (although one could argue Spiritual Healing was the start of the proggy Death instead of Human) and later albums become much more progressive/ melodic and much less like traditional death metal. It got so melodic that he couldn\u2019t release music under the name of Death as death metal which is why he started Control Denied. The Sound of Perseverance is the midpoint of Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s career in terms of sound, at which if Death sounded any more melodic; it would be no longer considered death metal. The Sound of Perseverance remains a mixed bag amongst Death fans; some criticized the album for being far too \"wanky\" and some praised the album for being Death\u2019s greatest release. I fall more into the latter category and may be subjected to bias since it was the very first Death album I listened to. I have since listened to Human and Symbolic, which I may review later on. Alright enough blabbing, let\u2019s get into the album. \n\nI\u2019ll first talk about the production. The production is crystal clear and is Death\u2019s best produced album. Everything sounds clear and distinct; you could just admire the production of this album alone rather than the actual music. Each cymbal hit rings out with clarity and just sounds damn good. A great example of where you can take note of the production is around the three minute mark of the opening track of \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\". It is even more obvious if you compare something like Human which sounded kind of murky and somewhat hard to distinguish the individual instruments to The Sound of Perseverance. \n\nAnother thing you\u2019d notice about this album is that Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s vocal style has changed considerably. From low guttural growling to an almost black metal like screeching, this alone would cause uproars amongst Death\u2019s fan base. This may be attributed to Chuck\u2019s cancer but I\u2019m not too sure. I for one don\u2019t mind it too much and I think it still fits the style of music well. It also sounds clearer and you can make out the lyrics easier than with his previous style. I\u2019m not saying it supersedes his previous style; it\u2019s just a change that I accept and don\u2019t make a huge deal out of it. \n\nNow the guitar is excellent overall and displays some traditional metal riffs like in \"Spirit Crusher\" and some great melodic leads like in the chorus of \"A Moment of Clarity\". Even to songs that would be considered blasphemy to the death metal genre *ahem* \"Voice of the Soul\", which I\u2019ll talk about more in depth later. The solos can be quite short like in \"Spirit Crusher\" where it lasts around 30 seconds to being around a minute and 30 seconds like in (again) \"A Moment of Clarity.\" Now for the aforementioned \"wanky\" elements; there are definitely some that are no doubt \"wank\" as in \"Bite the Pain\" where he decides to throw in some random lick that didn\u2019t really need to be in the song. I have to admit some of the solos just seem more sterile and don\u2019t really add to much to the song and are there for simply the sake of it example: \"Spirit Crusher\". (I really got to start referencing more tracks). There are around half a dozen types of riffs per song which makes each song interesting and enjoyable to listen to.\n\nOn to the drums\u2026 and what can I say? Richard Christy is a fucking good drummer. Everyone talks about Hoglan or Reinert but I hardly hear anyone mention Christy. This guy does some extremely complex stuff and there are hardly any beats that sound typical or unoriginal. All his beats typically utilize most of his drum set and are a joy to listen to. I had to watch a few Death drum covers in order to truly understand how good Christy was. Practically every part of his kit is used and he uses every single cymbal and drum head on his kit a few times for each song. Just look at the intro to \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" where he hits at least five different cymbals yet it still sounds great and not out of place. Parts that are mind-blowing and I had to pause for a bit in order to fully take in what I just heard is around the two minute part of \"Bite the Pain\" where he pulls off some unbelievable stuff. An extremely underrated drummer, Christy raised the bar of how I look at drumming in metal in general.\n\nThe bass lines in each song are complex and are definitely not just there for the sake of having a bass. There are many times where the bassist shines and is given his moments of having these interludes placed in songs where you can only hear the bass and maybe with some drum accompaniment. The bass isn\u2019t also buried under layers of other instruments and you can easily hear it for pretty much all of the tracks. One of my favorite bass lines in this album is for \"Spirit Crusher\" and damn\u2026 it sounds very menacing, like this evil being (the Spirit Crusher) is coming and the drums only add to it. Not too much to elaborate on the bass but it just sounds outstanding overall. \n\nThe lyrics, of course, are extremely well written and it is one of the many high standards of Chuck Schuldiner that consistently holds. However (get ready to flame the shit out of me), some of them border the line on almost mallcore like. Don\u2019t get me wrong; Death (especially on Human and songs like \"Crystal Mountain\") have very philosophical and deep lyrics. This is me just being pretty nitpicky. I just noticed that quite a few songs like \"Scavenger of Sorrow\" (example: \"If you doubt what I say/ I will make you believe\") seem to have this sort of \"I hate you\" attitude that is typical of that genre. Some of them are pretty cringe worthy like the beginning of \"Flesh and the Power It Holds\" (\"I told you once/ But I\u2019ll say it again\"). Perhaps there is a much deeper meaning to these lyrics? A very nitpicky thing I have about Death lyrics are that they don\u2019t take too long to interpret, as in they\u2019re not very cryptic or have many hidden meanings to them. This is a very small complaint as they still make you think about certain things in perspectives you never would\u2019ve imagined. Again, this is purely my opinion and I\u2019m sure that many, many other people would be glad to contradict me. \n\nThe song lengths are easily Death\u2019s longest overall with only 2 under the 6 minute mark. However, I don\u2019t really mind the song length because they are well structured and continue to hold your interest throughout each song. Although, some of the parts in each song are repeated quite a few times which may put some people off. Each part is complex and you probably won\u2019t fully appreciate each part if they weren\u2019t repeated that often. The track that would stick out the most to Death fans is easily \"Voice of the Soul\" where it is an instrumental that would be the last thing categorized as death metal because there is an acoustic guitar coupled with an electric guitar soloing over it sans drums, bass and of course vocals. It is a very solemn track where I often become contemplative and introspective when I listen to it. The album ends on a cover of Judas Priest\u2019s \"Painkiller\" which I have a sort of \"meh\" feel about it. It\u2019s not the best way to the end the album, but it doesn\u2019t feel too out of place and (like many people have said before me) Schuldiner pushes his voice to the limits on the track and you can truly behold what he is capable of doing vocally. Another interesting thing I noticed about this album is that each song sort of leads into each other or sounds similar to other songs on the album, like around 3 minutes through \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" it resembles \"Spirit Crusher\". The same can be said for a few other tracks on the album.\n\nIn conclusion, I think it is not best to look at this as a death metal album but more of a melodic progressive album which many find it as a hard pill to swallow considering Death essentially created death metal and their name is \"Death\" after all. Just look at Symbolic; it is hard to consider it as pure death metal especially with a drum intro like \"Zero Tolerance\" yet it was extremely innovative. Everything about this album is admirable and Schuldiner poured quite a bit of work into it to make such an album. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t receive so much criticism if Schuldiner released this under Control Denied\u2019s name. Ironically, Death\u2019s last and most complex and progressive album got me into Death which is probably why I give it this much praise. This is one of the albums that you have to listen to quite a few times in order to appreciate it (I know I did; I listened to the album four or five times and a few tracks around 25-30 times) so I don\u2019t blame you if you didn\u2019t like it at first. \n\nFavorite tracks: \"Bite the Pain\", \"Spirit Crusher\", \"A Moment of Clarity\", and \"Voice of the Soul\".\n",
        "\nI feel like such a sellout for devoting a post, on what is meant to be a death metal column for lesser-known gems, to fucking Death. Oh well, fuck it. I\u2019ve been binging on this album quite a bit as of late, so here\u2019s a write-up for you. I tend to have mixed views on Death. On one hand, Death/Chuck (obviously the nouns are interchangeable) was one of the pioneers of what was to become the wonderful genre of death metal. Mantas (Chuck\u2019s pre-Death band) was rehearsing and releasing demos like crazy back in the mid 80s. But, with the exception of The Sound of Perseverance, Chuck is also one of the most boring and predictable songwriters in death metal. Even way back then, bands like Possessed, Morbid Angel, and Necrovore (an awesome death metal band that only recorded one famous demo) were just a bit more dynamic in their songwriting. If you ask me, pretty much every death album until Human is good, but not spectacular in any way. Luckily, later-era Death happens to sound pretty damn good, even if Chuck still never changed his song structures with the exception of having longer solo sections. Although The Sound of Perseverance is Death\u2019s most musically ambitious effort, I think their crowning achievement is Symbolic.\n\nSimply put, Symbolic has Death at its peak in every conceivable way. It has the technicality and intensity that early-Death desperately lacked, and mixed it with somewhat longer songs that later-Death is known for, without being as overtly wanky like The Sound of Perseverance. The lineup here is my favorite Death lineup, if not for Gene Hoglan alone. His fills and hits on this album are just plain fun to listen to. Hell, just listen to the chorus of the title track. Those cymbal hits are just fucking addictive to listen to over and over again! Gene throws in awesome cymbal fills all over this track, especially when the main riff is played. How does this man manage to make any music he\u2019s involved in sound more interesting? Even the new Fear Factory album/\"that thing that might as well be his solo album\" has some decent grooves in it despite the obvious limitations of every other member of the band.\n\nWhile on the topic of the title track, it\u2019s an excellent way to start this album. The tempo changes really do wonders for Death\u2019s music, and the solo section shows an incredibly improvement over early-Death. While maintaining the \u201cfast\u201d edge that many death metal solos require, the solos seem to have an extra bit of epic feeling to them. Maybe this is just the awesome Florida sound shining through, but whatever it is, this is the best it ever sounded for Death.\n\nThis epic feeling is not just relegated to solos though. The lead guitar melodies in general sound epic throughout the entire album. Just check out the slow break towards the middle of \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 for a good example of this. Whatever the fuck is going on in the album cover, that feeling just seems to be conveyed through the lead guitar playing on this album. The riffs here lend themselves really well to this. They are by no means complicated or heavy relative to what was going on in Finland or Sweden, but they are incredibly fitting to the atmosphere created by the lead guitar playing. The thrashy influence is still there, but none of the riffs here feel chaotic like a lot of thrash-inspired death metal. Instead, these all feel meticulously planned out. The groovier riffs here work exceptionally well and do a wonderful job of complimenting the lead guitar and the drums.\n\nVocally, this is easily Chuck\u2019s best performance. It may not be as perplexing as his vocals on Death\u2019s cover of \u2018Painkiller\u2019 (he sounds like he\u2019s a chipmunk being castrated on that track), but he has that perfect mix of higher pitcher rasp mixed with enough deepness to still sound like a death metal vocalist. On tracks such as \u2018Empty Words,\u2019 his vocals just shine! For the most part, they do an excellent job of accentuating particular moments in songs while also being pretty articulate.\n\n\u2018Perennial Quest\u2019 shows hints of what Death\u2019s future would hold, as it\u2019s one of the very few tracks that deviate from the standard verse-chorus formula that Chuck used for a sizable chunk of his career. The outro to this song, and this album, is really quite emotive, which is an odd way to end a death metal album.\n\nWith the slowly progressing musical direction that Chuck was taking, which ended up with Death basically turning into a progressive metal band and him playing in the vastly underrated power/prog band Control Denied, we don\u2019t know what direction death metal might have taken if he was still alive. By the time this album was released, death metal was headed towards its low point (the late 90s weren\u2019t kind to death metal, although there are some exceptions). Was death metal as a whole supposed to go in a more progressive direction? It might have been interesting to find out, but although we can\u2019t do that, the least we can do is sit back and crank this album up to the maximum volume.\n\nWritten for http://thenumberoftheblog.com/\n",
        "\nI did not put this album on expecting to listen to death metal. From what I gathered off the band's front page on this website, their later works are categorized as a \"Death/Progressive\", meaning one, the other or both. After hearing the stark contrast between Scream Bloody Gore and Human, I thought, \"Well, this certainly isn't going to sound anything like their earlier shit.\" Okay, first track's up. Good opening but a punch in the face is what everybody expects from the start of a metal album. It sure is fast. More into the song, I think to myself, \"I need to start a fight with somebody.\" This is a good sign for me. And so it goes...Fast forward after about a dozen listens over several years and it hits me: The coherence...It's a lot of very technical, progressive metal yes but the lulls that enter quickly into the thrash sections are...inappropriate? That\u2019s an odd word. How about \u201ckind of dull?\u201d To be perfectly forthright I have never been a huge \u201cprogressive rock\u201d fanatic so there might be a bit of bias behind that statement. \n\nAs for the vocals? There's no gutter! That\u2019s okay. This is progressive metal. They're melodic but far from clean and very, very far from rasps. They aren't barks either. Categorization's never been my strong point in all honesty. The real question is whether or not I think they're good. Truthfully? I'd give them a C+ for \"motivation\". I mean, that's the whole point of a vocalist, right? His voice soars above the chaotic wall of noise and the driving bass-line thudding along with the drumwork to the point where you physically feel it in your bones but, and this is coming from an individual who never had the pleasure of witnessing Death live, it just doesn't seem like these would be the kind of vocals that would get me good and pissed at a show. I certainly won\u2019t believe that this album isn\u2019t meant to make crowds move either. I really want to be entertained by this but I keep finding myself almost being kind of startled (and not in a really good way I'm afraid) but the frequent melody schisms that happen within the same song. Perhaps that was the intention? Either way, it's one of those things that kind of just dawns on me where the words are connected and formed into the sentence, \"This part of the song sucks!\" \n\nTake Flesh and The Power It Holds for example to kind of clarify what I'm trying to say. It's all over the place. It keeps going from shred to \"here's some floor tom chugging\", then he does some virtuoso guitarwork layered over an emphasized bass to give it that, \"Here's the interlude!\" feel. Guess what comes after? Yes, of course: It's the part where they start riffing really fast again after some almost overdramatic single chord-strikes. No, wait. Moderately fast. Oh, there's that part. Great...This song is just unremarkable with every respect. Nothing sticks in my head. Yes, I know the word perseverance is in the album's title and that is obviously going to be a central thematic element behind the sound but, seriously, when I hear the next track, I think to myself: \"This is great music. Oh, here's that lull. Guitar scream. Oh yes, I can see it now, a man surrounded by harrowing images that he has to conquer as he stumbles in the dark and then he smashes through a wall in a great blaze of sun-light over blinded eyes. It's just too bad this song seems so ironic in light of some of the other shit licks they've put on this CD.\" The last thirty seconds in To Forgive is to Suffer? What the hell is that? It just doesn\u2019t sound good! I\u2019m afraid to say that one of the only truly redeeming songs on this album, for me, is Scavenger. It\u2019s not that the rest is \u201cbad\u201d, it isn\u2019t that it\u2019s bland either. It\u2019s like somebody tried to make a flesh golem taking 75% of Brad Pitt\u2019s body and then mixing it with Brian Pepper\u2019s. Altogether, this is great shit but there are some very noticeably detrimental qualities about the general songs\u2019 structure\u2019s coherence and choice of melodies and tempo changes. Last example: 3:55ish to 4:10ish in Moment of Clarity? Utter crap. The majority of the rest of the song? Great! Like any other teamwork though, it\u2019s only as good as the weakest member and that section of the song just kind of jars you and this is coming from somebody who tolerates a lot of music that I\u2019m willing to bet most of the people here would piss themselves laughing at me over. I give this a C+. A 75 with some extra points for the excellent cover at the end.\n",
        "\nThe primitive, chilling rush unleashed by the title track kicks off Death\u2019s most decrepit, cunning offering. The band never treads into wank territory riff-wise, so it\u2019d be logical to prepare for only the rawest of ceremonies. Listening to Leprosy in itself is a journey through dirt-layered crypts to reach the Underworld, stare Death in the face (literally), and leave with a renewed devotion toward the living. Scream Bloody Gore set the foundations for Schuldiner\u2019s master project, but Leprosy exceed the established goals. Death went from kids to ghouls beginning with this album.\n\nEach track progresses with fresh batches of horror-themed riffs reeking of charred cadavers (representative of the guitar tone), all of which contain no amounts of bullshit. Furious and merciless, these riffs strike like razors to the bone, dancing psychotically in tremolo-picked madness. That\u2019s the main style, with the crass, crude, mid-paced / top-down picking leaving ample room for doom and decimation to seep in. While twisty and vicious, harmonies aren\u2019t completely absent. They are treated negatively for conditioning purposes \u2013 slick riffs bred with mutated ones. Bass support stalks the guitars consistently in support of the rhythm; autonomous and bludgeoning like a focused version of the rhythm guitar lines (the guitars take up a wide spectrum in a small production field). The brunt of this madness arrives on \u201cLeft To Die\u201d. \n\nRozz and Schuldiner pack a crispy punch as a duo, which only further escalates into headbanging carnage with \u201cPull The Plug\u201d before retaliating on \u201cOpen Casket.\u201d The arid production job flattens the perseverance of profound atmosphere, thus leaving Rozz and Schuldiner to conjure with crusty, nightmarish riffs themselves. Fronting them are Chuck\u2019s throaty, mutilated growls and occasional airy shrieks \u2013 you can hear him yearning for blood like a ravaged zombie! I should also add that the high pinches and wailing solos \u2013 at the very most making Rozz have an orgasm \u2013 do add a cyber rim to the deceased tone (although the effect is miniscule).\n\nAndrews gets the mixed role out of the bunch, and for the most part the flak is deserved. I can\u2019t stand hollow snares, but the snare on these drums is perfunctory \u2013 utter shit. These snares are Department Of Defense-approved oil drums sealed with the carcasses of caught KGB spies boiling in necro-nuclear waste. As cool as that description sounds, it only means that these snares sound overly loud and mechanical. The rest of the kit is clearly mixed and blubbery, making the blasts and stampedes let loose by Andrews a true assaulting force. It does get annoying though with those clamoring snares\u2013 each hit just feels louder and longer than it\u2019s supposed to be in reality.\n\nSo while a dry production job limits some capabilities, Death still manages to eclipse their debut. The musicians brought forth raised the skill level and the songs formulate into mature slabs of carnivorous keepsakes. Rozz may go a little too far with some of his solos and guitar squealing. To me, this offering serves as the ideal early Death album and also stands alone in the late \u201880s progression into full-fledged death metal territory. It isn\u2019t too difficult to look past the flaws, so thrashers and death metal fans would be dumbasses for passing this one up because of them.\n",
        "\nThere are many arguments to be made about which album was the first 'true death metal' effort. Many would say Possessed takes this title, and certainly a case could be made, depending on where you feel thrash ended and death began. I like to take the safe route: the first pure death metal album is Scream Bloody Gore, the debut from Florida's legendary Death. The thrash elements remain, of course, since all death metal is derived from that, but this is the well from which so much of modern brutality has sprung.\n\nScream Bloody Gore is actually the work of only two musicians, the immortal Chuck Schuldiner performing all guitars, bass and vocals, and Chris Reifert (Autopsy, etc) behind the kit. It's a lot more primal than what you'd expect if you jumped on the Death-wagon during the years of Human, Individual Thought Patterns, or Symbolic. Despite what music theory dorks will tell you, the first three albums are the best of Death, because they were able to compose creepy, memorable music that really flaunted the...er...'virtues' of the form: evil sounding rhythms, brutal vocals, and excellent musicianship, without falling off the deep end.\n\n\"Zombie Ritual\" is easily the most recognizable track from the album, with its evil intro rhythm and flawless bloodflow of gory bludgeoning riffs, but there are many moments that glisten with with the sanguine discharge of its victims. \"Denial of Life\" has killer bridge and chorus riffing, a thrashing that is both creepy and happy. \"Regurgitated Guts\" is a hostile riffing beast, and \"Baptized in Blood\" has some excellent, maddening leads over the driving thrust of its rhythms. \"Torn to Pieces\" is another maniacal murder anthem that stands out on the album. The rest of the tracks are good, and this is still an album I can listen to all in one sitting, though a few lack that something 'extra'.\n\nAs for the downside, the lyrics here really blow, loaded with crappy rhyme schemes and disturbed imagery that a middle schooler might draw in his notebook when he's pissed off at the teacher. You won't find any of the pseudo-psychological, 'mature' tripe of the band's later work here. Just blood, guts, and loathing. But you can only get so much mileage out of:\n\n'Watch you bleed to death\nGasping for last breath\nChoking on your blood\nI shit onto your guts'\n\nAlas, thousands of death metal bands would use this simpler brand of lyrics for decades (pick a Mortician record at random, and read the lyrics), so despite my distaste, they were still an influential aspect of the record. The mix of Scream Bloody Gore is burly and raw, I think it remains intense and unforgiving and another reason I miss the standards of the 80s. As cult and important as the record is, I honestly favor its followup Leprosy, which is loaded from front to back with insanely great riffing. But this grandfather of death metal is still superior to about 99% of the genre's output since 1987.\n\nHighlights: Zombie Ritual, Denial of Life, Regurgitated Guts, Torn to Pieces, Evil Dead\n\n-autothrall\nhttp://www.fromthedustreturned.com\n",
        "\nOriginally formed as Mantas in 1983, the late musical legend Chuck Schuldiner decided to change the band's name to Death back in 1984. Their older material was considered to be straight forward death metal. This would include \"Scream Bloody Gore\", \"Leprosy\", \"Spiritual Healing\" and \"Human\" (1987, 1988, 1990 and 1991 respectively). Their later releases shy away from this death metal only approach, and would be considered to fall under genres of death/progressive metal. That seemed to be the aim for this final Death album. Chuck's progression in his songwriting really steered in the direction of this more melodic sounding song types, and a lesser focus on death metal only, as was previously mentioned.\n\nThe music on this album showed another very skilled and creative form of metal song writings. This displayed how Chuck focused more on melodic/technical guitar parts, and was opposed to being simply tied down to one particular genre. The guitar riffs on here reflect the mastermind's ideas put forth into action. This release is problably Death's most technical one; I'd say more so than any of their previous albums. The tracks such as \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", \"Bite the Pain\", \"Spirit Crusher\" and \"Flesh and the Power It Holds\" are extravagantly written songs. The reason I say this is because they seemed to be more reflective on melodic riffs and high screeching vocals, instead of the past heavier riff writing styles alongside a hoarse or guttural throat. Everything on here featured Chuck at his best in terms of songwriting capabilities; each track has its key moments, especially on the instrumental entitled \"Voice of the Soul.\"\n\nThe song tempos are moderately fast and explosive, with the exception of a few tracks. The metal just flows on this album, and each track demonstrates guitar parts that are totally original sounding and awe inspiring. There aren't any tracks on here that are boring or repetitive. The songs are so well thought out, and it's an amazing album to listen to. Analyzing each song, it's clear that every one of them are so original in their entirety. Some pieces seem to shine more so than others when it comes to their unique qualities, but overall the embellishments are remarkable. It's true that Chuck didn't like categories of metal; this was featured on a past interview via www.emptywords.org. But anyhow, his musical abilities really shined the most on this Death album; Chuck took metal to a new exploration here. For the most part, the songs are less brutal but still very catchy.\n\nThe sound quality was brilliantly mixed with each instrument well heard throughout the album. This was arguably one of the best produced Death releases ever thanks to Jim Morris. On a few different notes, I must say that the overall playing of each member was awesome. For example, Shannon Hamm, their last rhythm/lead guitarist was a little more technical than Chuck on his leads. He had a unique picking style, which was featured on Death's live DVD. Overall, this is one of the best lineups Chuck arranged to be featured here on this album. At the time, these musicians were hardly even known. Chuck was always notorious for selecting a different lineup on pretty much all of Death's releases. Each of the musicians on here are very talented, and Chuck did another good job of selecting the right people to perform on here.\n\nDeath's lyrical concepts focused more on topics such as spirituality and society, as opposed to mainly just gore. They are the most thought out than previous releases, and reflect these newer focal points. However, on most Death albums, Chuck's lyrics are very well done, especially on \"Individual Thought Patterns\" (1993). This final Death album is again arguably the best Death release, lyrically speaking. The focus was more spiritually driven, with less of an emphasis on other previous topics. A good example of this concept was on the track entitled \"Spirit Crusher.\" In addition, this album features a cover for Judas Priest's \"Painkiller\" on the last track, which was because of Nuclear Blast's re-released version back in 2001. A really good cover to say the least.\n\nIn conclusion, \"The Sound of Perseverance\" is Death's most technical and one of the most brilliant releases out of their entire discography. There aren't any tracks on here that don't show Chuck's brilliance in songwriting in terms of musical and lyrical capabilities. Chuck was metal's Mozart for sure, and death metal was pretty much founded by the band, at least during their earliest days. Don't miss out on this release, because it demonstrates so much diversity and originality. Chuck will be missed, but his legacy lives on through his music, in which he was able to put forth while he was living.\n",
        "\nLike most albums within Death's later works there is a tendency even by the band's more established fans to ignore this part of their career in favor of \"Scream Bloody Gore.\" While there certainly isn't anything wrong with wanting to hear more and more of those early days of death metal, it does cause some audiences to erroneously push aside Death's more accomplished works. What it boils down to isn't so much as a pissing contest between Death's earlier and later careers, but more of the perspective of a band's evolution.\n\nDeath, to me, are one of those bands who managed to be technical and progressive, yet enjoyable. Such a combination is not an easy one to find in death metal, especially in modern times where the emphasis is placed on sheer complexity for no specific purpose other than just to do it. Yet Death had a purpose all along for their progression and evolution, and their final album in \"The Sound of Perserverance\" saw yet another mountain being scaled.\n\nThe song lengths on \"The Sound of Perserverance\" are the longest of any Death album, which is interesting since song durations had been increasing with each successive release. The durations here break the five minute mark on average, with only two exceptions in \"Bite the Pain\" and \"Voice of the Soul,\" and with six songs that break the six minute mark. This is a remarkable shift from previous albums like \"Individual Thought Patterns,\" where the song lengths were 3-4 minutes. The additional times allow for more progressive elements and section changes, which is actually one of the only flaws present on this album, which I will get to later.\n\nThe other major change is Chuck's voice, which has adopted a thrashier vocal style instead of lower, heavier tone he's had on previous works. This allows a new facet to the band we haven't before, one that works very well in most regards. Its interesting to hear these changes, particularly since Chuck was the only remaining band member from the line-up that was featured on \"Symbolic.\" In some ways, its almost like \"The Sound of Perserverance\" was recorded by an entirely different band, yet, paradoxically, maintains that signature Death vibe.\n\nYou get a feel for what I mean in that last sentence by the opener, \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow.\" This nearly seven minute track goes through numerous changes, but most of these move quite smoothly. Like most of Death's later output, the song length feels longer than it really is due to all the changes and shifts that filter in and out. I don't count this as a negative aspect to the album or the band in general, as they pull it off better than most progressive death metal bands out there. \n\n\"Bite the Pain\" is shorter, and contains one of the more memorable riffs on the album. The song eventually picks up speed, which it maintains for most of the listen. Then comes \"Spirit Crusher,\" which a personal favorite of mine alongside \"A Moment of Clarity.\" Both of these songs are the most memorable of the bunch, whose progressive elements pull you into the song into instead allowing you to merely \"hear\" it. That seems to be the problem with \"The Sound of Perserverance,\" in that a good number of these songs don't reach out and grab the listener like \"Symbolic\" did. \"Symbolic\" pulled the audience into the album, whereas this album can be a little much to withstand at times. \n\nThe main problem with this isn't that the songs are too long, but instead that some of these songs have too many ideas and come off as over-developed. They become difficult to listen to on one full listen, which is something I never encountered on \"Symbolic\" or \"Human.\" I also get that feeling at times of the dreaded \"technicality for the sake of technicality,\" one of the things that Death never indulged in without some purpose. This is the only real flaw I could find on this album, save perhaps the Judas Priest cover tacked on at the end. The \"Painkiller\" is a definite keeper, no doubt about it, but I'm not a big fan of sticking covers at the end of a proper album. Its a bit picky of me, but it seems like that would have been best saved for a compilation of some kind.\n\n\"The Sound of Perserverance\" wasn't the strongest note for Death to exit on, but it was still impressive. Death climbed alot of mountains in their time, thanks largely to the genius of Chuck Schuldiner, but here it seems too much. The album is still an excellent one, especially for 1998 when it was released, a time when all forms of metal found themselves in awkward places and unsure where to go next. It still remains a favorite of mine in Death's catalog (along with pretty much every album they did) and while I can recommend it to the fan of Death's later works, I still acknowledge \"Symbolic\" as superior to this and their best effort.\n",
        "\nThe band Death were truly unique and amazing. No other metal band, I don't care who you think it was, was as brutal, evil, or metal as Death were back in their death metal days. However, after \"Spiritual Healing\" (only Death album I haven't heard), they matured on, introducing progressive influence into their sound. Their lyrics changed from extremly gore-y stories about zombies and the occult to being more spiritual and philosophical, giving the band the distinction of being the first band to use more intelligent themes in death metal. Over time, the band matured so much that almost no elements of their former selves remained, and Death was almost completly unrecognizeable.\n\nBut guess what? While most of the time, change means selling out, a few times, bands do it for their own musical needs, and this maturing is usually just as good if not better than the previous output. \"Symbolic\" is an example of this if there ever was one. It's not a pretentious \"hey look at me\" type of album, and the shredding, while still amazing, is far more humble than would be expected by this normally bland genre. Instead of \"shriffs\" (a portmanteau of shredding and riffs) typically used in this genre, the riffs show more emotion and purpose. A perfect example is the riff at 0:44 of the title track. Hands down, hearing this single riff on the 30 second iTunes sample made me obsess over this ablum until I finally purchased it. There is also the bridge of \"Without Judgement\", and the classical acoustic solo that closes the masterpiece that is \"Crystal Mountain\" which are good points of reference for the true materwork that is on here.\n\nThe vocals are performed, as always, by the legendary Chuck Schuldiner. On this album, his original guttural death growls have been replaced by a more growl/scream vocal style. It's like \"Human\"'s death grunted vocals fused with the thrash shreik he later used on \"The Sound of Perseverance\". Admittingly, he has never been a great growler, and I would take David Vincent over him anyday. However, what David Vincent doesn't have that Chuck does is raw emotion. There is so much emotion behind his vocals that you truly believe that \"inside crystal mountain, evil takes his form\" or that \"wherever we go, whatever we do, your shadow is not far behind our steps, and our breath\". Especially with lines like \"without judgement what would we do? we would be forced to look at ourselves emerged in lost time, assuming what may be...\" you can really feel Chuck's sorrow and at the same time his anger. It is for this reason that I respect Chuck as a vocalist just as much as a guitarist.\n\nDrummer Gene Hoglan, a thrasher, brings in a few new things to the table as well. While the drums on \"Individual Thought Patterns\" gave the music a more death metal feel, on this album he has stopped using so many blast beats, replacing them with more thrash-like beats. However, this is still worlds away from thrash metal. I've never been too big on Gene, but I'll admit that he does a very good job on here. On a separate note, his drum mix is very good, although I'd like it a little better if he was quieter, so we could here Kelly's bass better. That's on of the few unfortunate things about this album. Whereas all of the bands albums previously have had loud ass bass, this one is instead more of a guitar album. The bass is still very audible, just not to the extent of the previous albums.\n\nThe production is an interesting factor. It was the only album they ever released that ever had even remotly \"good\" production, and is in turn the easiest to listen to. It always annoyed me how they always suffered from shit production on every album up until this one. However, the mix is interesting as well, as the guitar, drums, and vocals are all at equal odds in the mix. The bass is not quiet, but rather tends to get overpowered by the other instruments. You can still easily hear the bass however, and it's not any less technical than on previous albums!\n\nSo, I suppose Death's \"Symbolic\" is one of my personal favourite metal band's best albums. Not the very best, mind you, but it's a classic if there ever was one. If you don't own this album, you aren't metal. Enough said.\n\n10/10\n",
        "\nDeath is one of those bands who needs no introduction, but discussing their career as a whole demands mentioning their various accolades. Their 1987 debut \"Scream Bloody Gore\" was highly influential on the now famous Florida death metal scene, whose golden era lay in the late 80's, early to mid-90's. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" seems to remain the album most fans of Death align with, and for some inconcievable reason, their technically superior later career is pushed aside for the horror and gore lyrics of that release. This leaves behind albums like \"Human,\" \"Individual Thought Patterns,\" \"The Sound of Perservance,\" and my personal favorite, \"Symbolic.\" Considering I've always viewed these albums as superior, and some of the best any American death metal band would release, it boggles the mind as to why Death's early career surpasses it in the minds of their fans.\n\nFor those who appreciate death metal that moves beyond the realm of horrific (and with the now mindlessly repetitive \"gore\" scene, downright senseless) topics of gore and murder, Death's 90's career is ideal. The subject focus moves away from their early career and instead focuses on the intellectual and at times, the spiritual (though don't confuse that with religious or anti-religious, Chuck Shuldiner was adamnant his music was not religious in any way.) In fact, you can take these songs seriously and perhaps even ponder the meaning behind the lyrics, something you rarely get with Cannibal Corpse and the generations of gore bands after them.\n\nAs with most Death albums, \"Symbolic\" sees a change in the line-up. Of course the band leader in Chuck Schuldiner is still here, whose vocal approach takes on a thrashier sound that focuses more on an decipherable scream. It reminds me a little bit of the vocalist off Malevolent Creation's \"The Ten Commandments,\" as its still harsh but the lyrics can be made out at times. If I had to mention anyone else in the line-up, it would have to be Gene Hoglan. Gene \"The Machine\" doesn't give his best performance on this album, but its still damn commendable but perhaps not to extent of Dark Angel's widely celebrated \"Darkness Descends.\" Kelly Conlon replaces Steve DiGiorgio on bass, which is a shame, as Conlon doesn't really deliver the way his predecessor did. He isn't atrocious in any way, and keeps the band moving in a structured way, he's just hard to hear at times.\n\nThe guitar work continues to flatten the listener, thanks to Schuldiner's great riff writing and technical yet enjoyable solos. The one thing I've always loved about this band was their ability to be both technical and enjoyable, something that is often hard to find in death metal's more recent generations. A perfect example of this combination would be \"Zero Tolerance,\" which rolls out those impressive yet memorable riffs that make Death the band they are. On the whole, I'd say this album isn't quite as impressive as the thematic \"Individual Thought Patterns,\" but with purely enjoyable songs like \"Crystal Mountain,\" \"Zero Tolerance,\" \"1,000 Eyes,\" and the title track, it comes out superior to that album in terms of a pure satisfactory listening experience. I'd even risk being called a heretic in the eyes of this band's core fanbase by saying it also comes out slightly better than their widely celebrated \"Human\" album.\n\nFor me, this is Death's finest hour. Its far removed from the blood splattered horror days of \"Scream Bloody Gore,\" and more enjoyable than \"Individual Thought Patterns\" before it, yet still intelligent and technically impressive. \"Symbolic\" remains my favorite Death recording, like all of their albums is an essential listen for all fans of this band and the genre they helped to popularize, not to mention bore the name of.\n",
        "\nWhile Death excelled metal music by laying fundamental hands in popularizing death metal genre, they also helped crucially in fortifying the progressive/technical face of this music, and this record was indeed a potent brick in the erection of the subgenre. Death has always been the constant drive in my playlist and this 1995 album appears to be, according to me and many more, the best one from them. Their earlier releases may exceed to some, especially the death metal purists or those who think being technical is a contamination in death metal \u2013 yes Human, Scream Blood Gore, Leprosy etc. are truly milestones and I guess not a single album from the band has even shown a tiny fragment of weakness, but all things considering, Symbolic means a complete perfection to me.\n\nFurnishing the emergence of death metal, with progressive aspects prevalent from the very beginning, after a while this Chuck Schuldiner band leaned more towards turning their music into something increasingly technical than before and this emphatically has a sizeable blow in a horde of today\u2019s spawning progressive/technical death metal outfits. Still, technical here does not denote the dullness being done by most of these acts, who suffer a zero sense of feeling. Moreover, this album has concealed a huge expressiveness beneath it, which has been offered song after song, and one can finely admit that this is not progressive and technical just for the role of sounding complex. The songs here do sound a bit complex in structure, but isn\u2019t as complex as Atheist, which may be a good facet here, as it has further supported the aforesaid \u2018feel\u2019 in a precise magnitude.\n\nThe mastermind Chuck Schuldiner has yet again struck this time with his more-than-amazing songwriting skills plus the raging shrieks. And the instruments are very much harmonizing with each others with a perfect match, thus forming a splendid sound. We can perceive this equally brutal and progressive as in earlier albums, with enlarged technicality and extra melody and thus forming a breathtaking experience.\n\nThe first track which is the title track is indeed an utterly good opener. The intro riff provides a typical Death gesture which assimilates into delightful slow and fast paces, and it may be no surprise to find the same passion streaming right till the end.\n\nThe guitar work by Schuldiner as well as Koelble is praiseworthy to a behemoth degree. Koelbe, as the second guitarist isn\u2019t overshadowed at all by Schuldiner, and he has showed his own things at times, which are much interesting to get, in fact. The lead solos and fills are genuinely Schuldineresque (which synonyms to above-excellent). Likewise the bass guitar by Kelly Conlon is impressive, which is very much audible and he has given his own portion through the instrument here and there.\n\nThe drums by Gene Hoglan are substantial \u2013 his duty is presented with complex beatings, advancing progressions and fair technical constituents. Quite impressive job there by the drummer \u2013 really beautiful and powerful slamming, providing the equivalent extent of power to other instruments, and thanks to the production that the drums are heard as plainly and noticeably as they could possibly be.\n\nEvery track is made distinctly tremendous; there are so many moments to remember within the fifty minutes mark where each track has to offer one great thing or the other, or to be exact, to offer everything great. Take the expressively beautiful intro of \u201cEmpty Words\u201d, the intro lead solo of \u201cSacred Serenity\u201d or the relatively slower chorus part of \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d, they all present genuine sentiments. However the principal highlight was the seventh track \u201cCrystal Mountain\u201d. This one may not be the most complex or technical one in the album, but surely is the track presenting few of the most wonderful moments in the album. Great song!\n\nNow the vocals are familiar Schuldineresque again this time, but a little raspier and a little more high-pitched than before. Honestly, I am not a huge fan of his vocals but I am also not against them. His deliverances are truly strong and I guess his higher screams suit the lyrical themes perfectly. Well, could something liberated from a Chris Barnes throat mix well with songs like \u201cEmpty Words\u201d and \u201cPerennial Quest\u201d in terms of their lyrical meanings?\n\nThe music revolves around old school death metal surfaces too, and the whole album is an incorporation of brutal melodies, as I would say. Death are obviously more melodic than most bands tagged as melodic ___ metal. Listen to the whole \u201cCrystal Mountain\u201d for this regard, this is what melody is meant to be but with equal heaviness and consequently in a brutal format. This is what makes Death different from other bands, which at times gets distracted with melody-crushing riffs, which still form a healthy synchronization between the segments.\n\nThis album most likely has the heaviest guitar-bass sound evident among the previous releases by the band, or for that matter. The reason \u2013 because the tones of everything are undeniably fine and this is much aided by the enormously improved production quality, which is no way near the preceding primitive degree. Everything is crystal clear and you can easily identify every note being hit.\n\nAs a whole, it is because of albums like these that Chuck Schuldiner is immortal. This is one flawless product.\n",
        "\nWell considering this is my first review, I want to start off with a release by one of my favorite bands, Death (or Mantas in this case). This was the bands third official release, with their first two demos being a rehearsal tape, and a demo called Emotional. This release is more recognized though, and it should be in it's right. The production is what you could expect from a demo, low quality. But, the low quality of the recording just adds to the rawness and power of the music.\n\nKams' and Chucks' vocals are just vicious on this, especially on Legion of Doom, which is one of my favorite songs by Death. Both of them hit beastly low grunts, with it adding in to the evilness of the guitars and drums, which Kam is pretty violent on. The guitarists, Rick Rozz and Chuck, both play in similar styles, but is generally a good thing, but don't be expecting to see any technical riffs in the style of Necrophagist. The bone crushing riffs employed were unheard of at the time. I would comment on bass, but it's unknown who the bassist was at the time.\n\n\nSo overall, this was a revolutionary release for the genre of death metal, but never got widespread recognition. It's pretty easy to find the songs uploaded on to sites like Youtube in it's original format. But it'd be better if you could find an original copy of it for the nostalgia and rawness. So, hail Death, and R.I.P (rock in peace) Chuck.\n",
        "\nDeath was founded by \"Evil Chuck\" Shuldiner (RIP) back in 1983. The musicianship was consistently evolving from solely death metal releases that turned into a more progressive songwriting approach. \"Evil Chuck\" chose one of Death's best lineups for this album. His previous songwriting reflected a more brutally oriented form of death metal. This became aloof because on here the songwriting reigned totally from a musical aspect. The lineup featured Chuck Schuldiner on vocals/guitars, Andy LaRoche on guitars, Steve Digiorgio on bass and Gene Hoglan on drums.\n\nIt seemed as though this release fell more under the melodic death metal genre. Even though Chuck's vocals were still hoarse, they were still incredibly easy to understand. With this in effect, the throat quality meshed well with the heavy D-tuned guitar riffs. The music was amazingly well concocted. Each track showed such an intelligent portrayal of guitar, leads and drumming. Rhythms were much more musical which really stuck with the listener.\n\nThis album contained a much more mature songwriting style than the 3 previous releases. Each guitar riff was entirely unique and innovative. Chuck came up with a whole litany of imaginative songs that were totally captivating. The heavy tremolo picked guitar worked well together alongside the throat outputs. Pretty much all of the songs contain a heavy and distorted guitar though there was an introduction acoustic piece. It was merely more of a segue into a heavier song entitled \"Destiny.\"\n\nIt seemed that Chuck was focused on sounding more musical because the majority of guitar parts here show a broader more introspective litany of songwriting. It featured Death's more creative side. The tempos for each song were not explosively fast because the melodic guitar dominated throughout this entire release. Another interesting aspect here is that the bass guitar was wholly audible. This was something that was lacking in prior Death releases. A pretty unique aspect to make note of was that Digiorgio played a fretless bass guitar.\n\nAll of the tracks are noteworthy. Some more so than others. I'd have to say that \"Trapped In A Corner\", \"Nothing Is Everything\" and \"Destiny\" were the most appealing songs out of this entire album. The reason was because they seemed to be more technical than the others. It's easy though to grow a liking to this whole album since it was part of Death's most unique outputs. Way more so than their first 3 releases. Many listeners may've held a similar conclusion.\n\nAndy LaRoche's leads were more advanced than Chuck's. His playing was more technical in this department. The sound quality could've been better though Scott Burns did a good job with the mixing. The bass guitar was loud enough so that you could here it alongside the guitars. Just the audio for the guitars could've been louder. They didn't drown the rest of the instruments out. The drums by Hoglan were right on cue with the riffs. Plus they were easier to hear than on previous releases.\n\nLyrically speaking, Chuck's focus was more on a spiritual aspect for Death. They were entirely original and well thought out. The track \"Destiny\" gives the listener an idea as to what direction this album portrayed as far as the words go. Death's first 3 releases especially their first focused more on gore. This was a more immature aspect of Death's lyric writing. But this release reflected an incredibly more intelligent approach. No covers here. All of the tracks are originals.\n\nThis album was anger fortified though the songs showed a brilliant skill of song/lyric writing by \"Evil Chuck.\" The rhythms reflected an intriguing approach which wasn't as prevalent on the 3 previous releases. The sound quality could've been better but all 40 plus minutes of this album was wholly intriguing, original and imaginative. It remains to be one of my personal favorite releases from Death. Such an inspiration that carried with it a legacy regarding the influence Death's impression had on the metal community.\n",
        "\nWell this is probably my favourite Death album, so that goes to show how much of a Death fan I am. Bear in mind I haven't heard Leprosy or Human in their entirety, but I like this a bit more than Scream Bloody Gore and I definitely like it more than the proggy stuff they did later on. \n\nThis album demonstrates the only thing that was ever good about Death (not including their demo era - Infernal Death is a killer), and that's Chuck's guitarwork. Spiritual Healing is full of great riffs and leads and that was definitely Chuck's strong point. All of the negative things I normally have to say about this band are toned down on this album, it is somewhat progressive sometimes (in the leads especially) but not as wanky as The Sound of Perseverance, and it still sounds trapped in the old-school but it's not really as embryonic and thrashy as Scream Bloody Gore. Chuck's voice is at it's best here, where the plain and rather under-developed throaty yell of the first album meets head on with the annoying rasps of his later works and the two sort of cancel each other out, and he gives his least offensive performance. But the riffs really do make this album, and I'd say that's the only reason it should really be listened to. \n\nWhy the only reason? Because the song structures aren't that great and still don't inspire much, I think one thing Chuck (and the rest of the band, which seems to change on every album) lacked was compositional skill. The songs are also rather restricted, limited to a mid-pace stomp with a rather dull rhythm section. Chuck Schundler, while not as bad as he would get later, still sounds like a retarded John Tardy, and the lyrics are kinda lame too, he wines about abortion and stuff and that's really not what I want to hear on a fucking death metal album, whatever happened to Regurgitated Guts? \n\nIt's a good album anyway, despite it's flaws, and it's a good place to start as it has a good mix of the straight forward death metal of 80s Death and the progressive and showy late 90s stuff. Shit, I'm not even a Death fan and I quite like it so make of that what you will.\n",
        "\nThis album along with \"A Celebration of Guilt\" by Arsis are my absolute death metal shrines and if you don't own this album you cant truly appreciate the original death metal powerhouse known as death. Most fans of Death would tell you that 1991's \"Human\" is the best Death album because it balances out the elements of both there death metal days and more progressive sound material of there later works. Although I do believe that \"Human\" is indeed a masterpiece I tend to lean more towards Deaths progressive material so this was a natural choice for me. This is also the album responsible for my introduction to death metal along with Morbid Angel's \"Altars of Madness\" so this album will always be an album that I treasure for that reason.\n\nThis album kicks off with the title track and is arguably the highlight of this album as it is responsible for one of Death's most memorable riffs and without a doubt one of Chuck's greatest solo's and if you know his material thats saying a lot. This album goes on with such classic Death songs as \"Zero Tolerance\" which is also one of Deaths most recognized songs due to the drum intro and once again epic solo by Chuck schuldiner and later a trade off solo with Chuck and Bobby Koelble. Other great tracks on the album include \"Sacred Serenity\", \"Without Judgment\", and my personal favorite the most popular track off this album which is \"Crystal Mountain\". Crystal Mountain is a classic song from start to finish and all its moments are great from the main riff to the tapping solo and the acoustic solo that ends the song Crystal Mountain is to me Deaths finest hour. Another one of my favorites on this album is the last track \"Perennial Quest\" which I think is a very underrated Death song.\n\nIf you know Death you know Chucks extremely high standards for for musical ability in all the members he brings in and \"Symbolic\" is no exception. For this album guitar god Andy LaRoque from King Diamond who played on \"Individual Thought Patterns\" was replaced with Bobby Koeble who did a more than ample job on this album. Also bass duties were taken over by Kelly Conlan who replaced Steve Digiorgio. However still on drum duties was Gene Hoglan who will forever be my favorite drummer for playing on my two favorite Death albums (though his work with Testament and Dark Angel wasn't to shabby either). Currently Gene is working with Dethklok and Fear Factory who will be putting out a new album soon with Gene on drums so be sure to check that out.\n\nOf all the albums on this site that got perfect album reviews this one without a doubt deserved this review because it is a goddamn classic death metal album that changed the way I write my own music. Today Chuck Schuldiner is still my all time idol both in music and in life since he had such great philosophies on living life and just enjoying every moment of it. If you don't own this album already you need to go pick it up now because it's key to any metal collection.\n\nRIP CHUCK 1967-2001\n\nStandout tracks\n\"Symbolic\"\n\"Zero Tolerance\"\n\"Without Judgement\"\n\"Crystal Mountain\"\n\"Perennial Quest\"\n",
        "\nDeath as you probably know is the band widely credited with creating death metal or at least popularizing it. After being formed in 1984 they went on to release their debut album \u201cScream Blood Gore\u201d in 1987. That was the start of their career and 8 years later, after many changes in line-up and sound they released Symbolic. Now, almost 15 years later, this album stands as one of the top contenders for the definitive progressive death metal album. This album will make you forget instantly about Opeth\u2019s \u201cBlackwater Park\u201d.\n\nNow the first thing I mentioned about this album was how many changes Death has gone through. The line-up for this album is Chuck Schuldiner (Vocals/ Guitar), Kelly Conlon (Bass), Bobby Koelble (Guitar) and Gene \u201cAtomic Clock\u201d Hoglan (Drums, obviously). This line-up contains two of the same members as the last album did but the sound on this album is vastly different. There is a more mature sense about the lyrics, this time relating to real-life issues, and the music itself is just so much more interesting. \n\nThe guitar has some epic riffs and solos (more so than previous efforts). The song \u201cEmpty Words\u201d has the most emotional riff I\u2019ve ever heard in any Death song. During the chorus when Chuck is belting out \u201cPromises! Have potential! To hurt, is anything real?\u201d Also the riff in the chorus of \u201cSacred Serenity\u201d is worth mentioning as well. Now to the solos! My favourite solos on this album are the ones in the title track and Crystal Mountain. Crystal Mountain is one of my favourite songs and the solo is one of the most eargasmic things I\u2019ve ever heard. \n\nThe bass is also better than most Death albums. It is used a lot in the intros of songs. Especially in the intro to \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d. The intro to \u201cSacred Serenity\u201d also features some really cool sounding bass riffing. Now if this album had Steve DiGiorgio like the last album did then that would be amazing. \n\nThe drums are perfect. But that was to be expected seeing as it\u2019s the Atomic Clock himself behind the kit. The drums are interesting and complex. They are extremely technical and fit every song perfectly. I am absolutely stunned that he was able to pull it off, especially the tempo changes in songs like Symbolic. It starts off slow with slow drumming and in a second at about the 30 second mark it blasts away at thrash like speeds. \n\nVocals are an important thing on a metal album. This is usually what makes most bands listenable or not and it is because the vocals are usually in the \u201cforeground\u201d of the music. Now the vocals on this album do not disappoint. They have become less guttural yet again and are leaning towards the shrieky style that Chuck would develop for the next album. But they still have all of the aggression they had before and are more comprehensible. And by comprehensible I mean that I can understand every word on this CD but the vocals are still harsh and aggressive. \n\nOverall this album does not fail to please and is a must have for any fan of Death. If you are a fan of Death and don\u2019t have this album I can only say that you are missing out. \n\nHighlights: \n-\tThe tempo changes and solo of the title track\n-\tThe epic and emotional chorus of Empty Words\n-\tThe Intro and chorus of Sacred Serenity\n-\tCrystal Mountain\n",
        "\nIt has been claimed by a certain part of the metal community that Chuck Schuldiner was a Christian who died of AIDS. The claim was probably half-serious at most, and likely trolling, but The Sound of Perseverance does sound like Christianity and AIDS. Like Christianity, this is incoherent; like AIDS, this was a disease that weakened metal's immune system to modern technical death metal (i.e. this probably had a big influence on it).\n\nThis is an album by none other than the legendary Death, but this is not death metal. There is not a single death metal riff to be found on this album. There is no darkness, morbidity, or a sense of death in any of the riffs. The melodies, played with a sterile and clean lead guitar tone, are so modern and sugary that they sound like melodeath at best and some shopping-mall mainstream music at worst. I am not as versed in that type of music to point out specific examples (like emo, pop punk, etc.), but this is not in the least meant as a hyperbole. The first riff of A Moment of Clarity is an example \u2013 while it has the disjunction characteristic of this album, the shitty melody can be clearly heard \u2013 and the vaguely Egyptian but fundamentally saccharine lead passage enclosing the guitar solo of the same song is another. Not even the vocals here are death metal vocals. They are, admittedly, somewhat unique \u2013 but also bad. They are somewhere in-between high-pitched clean singing and harsh vocals, and sound very forced and uncomfortable. The incorporation of clean vocal elements allows more control over the melody than is usual for the typical harsh vocals, but this aspect, instead of being used wisely, only results in melodeath-like vocals, and in some cases even pathetic attempts at catchy sing-along choruses (e.g. around 5:00 of 'Story to Tell'). \n\nIt could be said that a sense of chaos is an important in death metal, and this is chaotic in a sense, but ultimately its death metalness, or the album's quality in general \u2013 for those of you who think technical sugar \"metal\" like this is not inherently inferior to death metal \u2013, is inarguable. It is chaotic in the sense that it is random and disjointed, but it has no meaningful feeling of chaos. If real death metal is ordered chaos, this is chaotic order. In real (good) death metal, chaotic riffs are arranged in an unpredictable but ultimately sensible order, but here somewhat orderly-sounding (though not really ordered in any good way) riffs are arranged in an utterly chaotic fashion. A variety of riffs are employed, including thrashy riffs \u2013 though they are in a more melodeath fashion than real thrash due to the sugary melodies \u2013, arpeggios, chugging, and some mid-paced melodic power chord progressions. Riffs are generally bad in themselves \u2013 often a melody is dissected into pieces by the chugging between every melodic note, or a riff simply consists of some chugging before a technical lead-like phrase comes in at the end, and there are lots of stop-starts and technical proggish riffs. It is certainly a difficult task to make coherent songs out of these building blocks, which are hardly coherent themselves and appear irrelevant to each other, but even this handicap (which was caused by the band itself anyway) cannot excuse the level of illogic and chaos displayed by songwriting on this album. Literally the majority of transitions from one riff to the next sound extremely arbitrary, and even the others are hardly smooth. If you took all the riffs from this album, mixed them, and made 8 songs ('Painkiller' doesn't count) by randomly choosing the riffs for each song, it wouldn't really be that different from the original album. Moreover, the interjections of short lead phrases are often completely unrelated to the riffs (see 1:40 of 'Bite the Pain,' for example), and the abrupt ending of guitars are always followed by bass lines unrelated to the guitar riffs surrounding the non-guitar section.\n\nThere is very little to say about the structural aspect of this album when structure is barely present at all. There is no unifying theme, nor any logical progression or development. That said, there is a certain pattern that each track follows (though the term \"song structure\" cannot be used here) \u2013 there is a cycle of riffs, some of them repeated within the cycle, which is followed by a guitar solo in the middle, then the cycle repeats itself before the song comes to an end. Astounding \u2013 they actually managed to sound both totally random and repetitive. The guitar solos consist of the same repulsive melodic content, and more: often the main theme of the solo would be interrupted with some technical phrase that is really nothing but finger exercise. Near the end of 'To Forgive is to suffer,' there seems to be a melodic build-up not entirely opposed to logic, but then it quickly collapses into irrelevance as a completely unrelated lead guitar shred comes in to end the track. Voice of the Soul, an instrumental with clean guitar accompaniment and overdriven solos, at least sounds a lot more consistent compared to the other songs on this album, but an Yngwie Malmsteen piece (which isn't exactly the pinnacle of metal, to put it mildly) is easily more coherent and much more metal than this.\n\n'Painkiller,' not surprisingly, is by far the best track on the album, but even this is totally ruined compared to the original version. The over-the-top vocals, while not even close to Halford's \"laser-bullet\" voice in fitting in with the rest of the music, work better than they do on the rest of the album, but the guitar solos are absolutely reprehensive. They bear very little semblance to the original versions; the Death version of the Tipton solo starts out with meaningless shredding before it is transformed into a very bright-sounding and upbeat section that absolutely loses the sense of tension the original version had, and the Downing solo is turned into mere scale exercise.\n\nThe rhythm section on this album is rather inventive; the drumming is varied, with numerous fills, and the bass often acts independently of the guitars. However, they do nothing to save the non-existent structure of the songs, and even add to the overall sense of randomness due to their lack of integration with the guitars. This is really a horrible album with lots of technical exercises and no structure, and not even Painkiller will kill the pain induced by listening to this album.\n",
        "\nI am not one that cares about labels that much. I do enjoy little quibbles with my friends about whether early Sepultura is death or thrash metal or if Tormentor were first or second wave, however, if it is good, well structured music with atmosphere and a purpose then I will like it. On the other end of the spectrum though there is this \"Progressive Death Metal\" album which is neither progressive, nor really death metal and also average for the most part. \n\nWhen using the phrase \"Progressive\", people seem to either be saying one of two things. It could either be influenced by the ingenious work written by progressive rock bands in the 1970's, or the general meaning of the phrase which would be more on the side of avant-garde, such as writing something original or ahead of the times.\n\nSadly when \"Progressive\" is used as a prefix to another label of metal, the result normally seems to be a watering down of a genre that is innovative in itself, therefore almost making it more of a regression that a progression. An example of this is Enslaved's recent albums of \"Progressive Black Metal\" being a sound of stale and uninspired hard rock losing the mystical magic of their debut, which was a progressive masterpiece (in the sense of unique combined with influences from the 70's). It may be somewhat intelligently written with some reasonable Floyd worship but adds nothing to the genre except for maybe attracting more mainstream fans.\n\nRant aside this album has all the signs of trying to be progressive but in fact becomes regressive. Death were obviously a very popular and important early death metal band with a string of demo's and a couple of classic death metal albums. The first two Death albums were original, heavy, catchy and still coherently written pieces of sickening art. Then Chuck thought it would be a good idea to change the sound a bit. This is not necessarily a bad idea, but if you look back on death metal in the mid to late ninetees, it seems to normally end up being somewhere from a bad idea, to an embarassing idea. Albums like \"Heartwork\", \"Domination\", \"Slaughter of the Soul\", and there are many more, have been dimissed by the metal underground and applauded by the metal mainstream for years and somehow the similar move by Death appears to me to have been largely ignored. What Death appear to have done here is take their earlier material and replaced the intensity with what is probably pre-conceived \"intelligence\" but is actually a lack of imagination and rather sterile material for the most part.\n\nI do state all these things with the forethought that this is supposed to be some kind of metal classic so my score may be strict, but with other real classics under their belt and such a saturation of the market with the introduction of the internet I feel albums need a stricter analysis. There are some interesting parts to the album, the title track for example sounds more like power/thrash metal featuring Chuck's new high pitched vocal style, admittedly with the solo being admirable and drumming being impeccable. Crystal Mountain is also worth a listen due to the interesting moulding of ecoustic guitar around a fairly rocky song-base and may be one of the only sougs that I think could be linked to the 70's progressive rock scene, although still only very lightly and not coming anywhere near the brilliance of the 70's prog bands..\n\nUnfortunately this album just does not do much for me. Their attempt at being progressive hardly ever finds its feet, with most of the album featuring heavy or thrash metal riffs with a boring clean production with Chuck Schuldiner's new vocals being less enthused than before. I find during the album a lot of the riffs seem to just meander and fizzle out to nothing in the context of the song. Take \"Zero Tolerance\" for example, a lot of groove (actually sounding like Pantera riffs sometimes, I'm afraid) and a couple of solo's that could have come from any of the Bay Area thrash bands and you have a song that is by no means offensive, it's just not something I am going to go back and listen to much as it comes off as somewhat unoriginal \"Death-Metal-Light\".\n\nA notable use for this album is that it seems to be pretty effective at getting people who are not into the more extreme forms of music to realise there is another world out there. It has the catchiness of sing along choruses, the pseudo-groove riffs that progressive metal bands seem to love, and much more liberal lyrics than the classics of death metal. That does not help the album in any real sense, but it has converted some of my friends to realise that if you dig deep enough you can find more profound pieces of work than just checking out how fast Jordan Rudess can shred those keys!\n\nThe technicality of albums is not something I am really interested in, purely for the fact that practice makes perfect. If you have the time to sweep pick 6 hours a day, you will eventually become good at it. This by itself does not make you a genius, however, if you put these techniques to good use, then you have something. Death's technical material seems the worst out of the era to be honest, with the true originators of the sound not losing any intensity and some actually gaining it. \n\nTake Atheist for example, very technical but still aggressive with the songwriting to match. Cynic, who's members also were quintessential to the first technical Death album, managed to create an incredible marriage of jazzy, 70's prog induced death/thrash metal. Lastly Cryptopsy created a technical and brutal release in \"None So Vile\", taking extremity to new levels but still having the song writing skills to keep the tracks chaotic but tamed in a compact structure. Death on the other hand seemed to focus alot on the rock and heavy metal aspects after \"Human\" and never really matched the true innovators of the technical/progressive releases by the aforementioned bands, or their earlier groundbreaking material.\n\nOverall this is not an album I would really advise for anybody unless you are just starting to try and get into death metal. Otherwise there are so many classics from an exiting, boundary pushing period of time rather than the rock induced format of the genre that bands seem to utilise in the mid-to-late ninetees, that this record is just not really necessary. Overall you will be more than satisfied with Atheist, Pestilence or Gorguts if technical death metal is your thing, or \"Scream Bloody Gore\" or \"Leprosy\" if you want a release from this once great band.\n",
        "\nAlright then. What we have here is the super raw recording of five blood-thirsty devastating metal assaults, that were pioneering and essential for shaping the entire Death Metal genre. We hear Charles \"Evil Chuck\" Schuldiner's first recording, alongside Barney Kamalani Lee and Frederick DeLillo aka. \"Rick Rozz\".\n\nThe recording quality is pretty raw and snotty, however, the Death demos were never known for being mastered properly. The demo tape starts off with \"Legion of Doom\" and contains some very good, back then unheard brutal guitar riffs. The vocals by Kam Lee are destroying (consider, it was 1984). It is growling for the most part, but with a certain amount of high-pitched screams. There is a slower part in the song that reminds me of the beginning of the song \"Infernal Death\" that would first be recorded in 1985. \n\nThe first song is followed by \"Evil Dead\", probably one of Death's most famous songs. From the well-known lead intro over the Kam Lee style vocals and the powerful riffs by Schuldiner and Rozz to the guitar lead, this is pretty much the \"Scream Bloody Gore\" version. Track #3 is \"Beyond the unholy Grave\", a very fast and all-in-its-way-crushing song with a simplistic but super audible and fast guitar riff, supported by Kam's smashing intro cymbals and pounding drum beats. \n\nTrack four, \"Power of Darkness\", is a very short but nevertheless kickass song, with a less audible guitar riff and drums, but some excellent death growls.\nWe then arrive at the final and title-track, \"Death by Metal\", which is next to \"Evil Dead\" my favorite on this album. Everything here is what you can only expect from the murder trio. The beginning riff and cymbals are super-headbangable, and the main riff is fuckin awesome. It's a pity this song didn't find its way to an album. It's really worth it.\n\nThe only thing however, that is not good, is the production. This demo was recorded in a rehearsal room with Rick Rozz's cassette player and that's what it sounds like. It reminds me of the horrible sound quality of Hellhammer's 1983 demo tapes. Still, if you imagine what the songs -could- sound like, you will agree with me when I say that they're definitely fucking A.\nBecause of that, and probably also because I'm hardcore into Death, I give this demo a 75 % rating because it was ground-breaking for Death Metal.\n",
        "\nDeath \u2013 one of the founding fathers and most influential representatives of the extreme subgenre of heavy metal commonly referred to as death metal. Whenever I think of this magnificent band I cannot help but wonder to what new heights mastermind Chuck Schuldiner would have taken his ever-evolving outfit had he not passed away so soon.\n\nAlas, since he sadly is no longer with us, we are left with Live in L.A. and Live in Eindhoven as the band\u2019s last official releases on CD, save some rather forgettable best-of compilations that were published posthumously. I haven\u2019t listened to Live in Eindhoven (which contains almost the exact same track list as the record reviewed here), so I couldn\u2019t tell which is the better of the two. What I do know is that Live in L.A., being Death\u2019s only official live album (aside from its aforementioned twin brother, of course), should be a mandatory purchase for every fan of Death or death metal in general.\n\nThe three factors that generally make or break a good live album are recording quality, musicianship and song selection. With regard to the first, the subtitle of this release (Live & Raw) actually fits perfectly, as it is indeed a pretty raw affair that hardly surpasses the sound quality of a competent live bootleg. At the same time, it\u2019s hard to find too much fault with this as all the instruments are adequately audible and the recording is at least honest \u2013 this isn\u2019t one of those \u201cAlive in the Studio\u201d deals where all the minor glitches and screw-ups that are bound to occur during a live concert were subsequently erased to make for a more streamlined, polished sound. Let\u2019s just say that when the volume is turned up loud enough, Live in L.A. definitely allows for a rather pleasurable listening experience.\n\nWhen it comes to the musical performance of the band itself, not much needs to be said other than it\u2019s virtually impeccable; after all, we\u2019re talking about Death here, arguably one of the most technically proficient outfits in extreme metal history. Say what you will about Chuck\u2019s constant line-up overhauls, but he always surrounded himself with absolute top-notch performers who never failed to deliver. This time around, special mention goes to drummer Richard Christy, who puts on a jaw-dropping clinic on his kit, and of course Mr. Schuldiner himself. Considering how technically demanding Death\u2019s music had become in the latter stages of their career, Chuck appears almost superhuman as he not only nails his guitar parts with awe-inspiring virtuosity \u2013 he even pulls off the beautiful solo in \u201cTrapped in a Corner\u201d (possibly one of the greatest solo passages in all of heavy metal) to near perfection \u2013, but at the same time delivers an impressive vocal performance. He always had one of the most instantly recognizable voices in all of death metal, and this fact coupled with the incredible amount of venom he manages to put into his lines can literally send shivers down one\u2019s spine. For instance, the way he snarls the words \u201cspirit crusheeeerrrr\u201d in the eponymous song is in itself almost enough to justify buying the album.\n\nFinally, as with all live recordings, the song selection on Live in L.A. is an aspect that cannot be judged by objective means. It\u2019s impossible to please everybody, particularly since this isn\u2019t a double disc set and a single CD provides only so much space. The only complaint I personally have is that the album features only two songs from the band\u2019s discography before Human (\u201cPull the Plug,\u201d with a nice tongue-in-cheek intro inspired by the TV series Charlie\u2019s Angels, and, of course, the inevitable \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d), clearly putting the main focus on Death\u2019s final two studio albums Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance. The most glaring omission may be the complete lack of songs from Spiritual Healing, but again, that\u2019s a moot point because in the end it all comes down to different people\u2019s individual preferences.\n\nWhile Live in L.A. isn\u2019t exactly perfect due to the rather pedestrian recording quality, the meager packaging (no liner notes and only a few photos) and the fact that one CD simply isn\u2019t enough to commemorate Death\u2019s stellar career, it is nevertheless a very nice live document of one of the most important metal bands to ever grace this planet. Even though Chuck is no longer around, this album is further evidence that he has left a lasting impression and will forever live on through his music.\n",
        "\nChuck Schuldiner was a musical genius and visionary who was throughout his career was always trying to push the boundaries of music. With Death he helped to define the Death Metal genre and then, on later albums, extend its limits by bringing increasing amounts of progressive influence into the equation. Death\u2019s first album, Scream Bloody Gore, has been called the archetypal Death Metal album. Some think it should be called the first Death metal album whilst others say that title belongs to Possessed\u2019s Seven Churches. One thing that no one can deny though is that Scream Bloody Gore was an extremely important album that has influenced many generations of metal heads.\n\nSchuldiner was always changing around the line-up for Death in order to be able to make the best record possible. Although this meant that Deaths line-up was not stable Schuldiner seems to have picked the right people for the job as the musicianship on the albums always sounds great. On this album Schuldiner plays guitar and bass, as well as doing vocals. To play drums Schuldiner recruited Chris Reifert (now famous for his work in Autopsy/Abscess).\n\nThe guitar work on this album is very thrashy but slightly heavier. Schuldiner has two main guitar playing speeds which he uses throughout the album which are fast and very fast but the album does have a few slightly slower sections, mainly on the choruses of songs. The riffs are mostly simplistic but they are memorable and will stick in your head for ages. The solos are also great; they\u2019re not insanely fast but give Schuldiner a chance to show off his guitar skills and technicality (something he would expand on in later albums). The guitar work is driven along by Reifert\u2019s drumming. There\u2019s nothing special in the drum area but a nod must be given to Reifert for being able to keep his drumming up for the duration of the songs and for being able to keep up with Schuldiner two speeds.\n\nMost of the lyrics on the album are mostly your standard Death Metal fare, although of course back then there was no standard Death Metal, with zombies, blood, gore, death and pain all making an appearance although the lyrics on Denial Of Life do seem to have slightly more depth to them. Most of the vocals on the album are mid \u2013 pitch screams which Schuldiner delivers with precision. On most songs the lyrics aren\u2019t even necessary as the sounds coming out of Schuldiner\u2019s mouth do the job perfectly.\n\nThe only real problem I have with this album is, that like so much death metal, after the great memorable riff, the light-speed drumming and guitar work kicks in and then that\u2019s all there is in the song until the solo. Although not great this is forgivable though as most of the songs on the album do have catchy riffs, great solos and at some points do even slow down for some more mid-paced guitar.\n\nThe album was recorded in LA at the Music Grinder studios. Although not the cleanest production ever I have no problems with the sound on the album at all as most of the time you can hear everything that is going on. The producer was Randy Burns (did he produce Megadeth\u2019s Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? album) and he does a great job at getting the most out of both Schuldiner and Reifert.\n\nEvery song in this album is a classic but the standout tracks for me are Infernal Death and Zombie ritual for the sick opening riffs and the excellent Baptized in Blood for its great chorus.\n\nOverall, this is a great album with some great songs on it. Later on in his career Schuldiner went more progressive but the early Death albums, even if more simple, can still match, if not exceed the greatness of the later albums. If you like Death Metal at all you should definitely buy this album.\n",
        "\nEven though the two albums are only a year apart, there's a definite difference between Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy. While Scream Bloody Gore has a frenetic and frantic thrash vibe to it - like it can't wait until it gets to the end - Leprosy tones it all down a notch. There are fast tempos here as well, but the change of drummers from Chris Reifert to Bill Andrews has a clear effect. If Andrews had been doing the drumming on Scream Bloody Gore, he would have been screaming for Chuck to tone down. He just couldn't have kept up. Especially the fast fills of Reifert are distinctly missing on Leprosy. Andrews is lazily pounding away on the drums, mostly his snare. The man does love that drum. Do not expect anything as marvelous as the chorus of the previous album's title track. What makes matters worse is the fact that the snare sound is very flat and brought to the forefront in the mix. It overpowers a lot of the sound and completely controls the drums. This combined with Andrews's overuse of it makes this one of the worst drum performances I've heard on an album. The other drums don't sound very good either, but all of their flaws can be forgotten in light of the snare. The snare overpowers cymbals pretty much completely, the bass is flat as well, but not as bad as the snare and the tomtoms... Well, it's not like Andrews really uses them anyway. The first few seconds of Born Dead clearly illustrate what is wrong with Andrews's drumming. It has a couple of alternating beats, both rather fast in terms of the album, yet Andrews manages to make them sound lazy, like he was playing for Electric Wizard instead of Death. \n\nOf course, other matters make it differ plenty from Scream Bloody Gores as well. The material is all very recent. Some of the tracks on the debut were older than the band itself, that is if you don't consider Mantas and Death the same entity. The riffs there are very thrashy. However, there aren't many traces of that on Leprosy. There is a riff like that in the beginning of Open Casket. Combined with a pounding double-bass beat with nearly no snare in sight, it makes up one of the highlights of the album. Open Casket also showcases the more advanced songwriting on Leprosy with numerous parts, a lot of changing rhythms and most importantly, the slow and ominous parts. These are the highlights of the songs they appear on. They keep the drumming to a minimum, emphasize the intimidating and usually more intricate riffs as well as bring the vocals to the forefront. The heaviness of the production also showcases its best parts more efficiently. When the drums aren't there to mess things up, you can clearly hear every instrument. The best of these parts are the ones that include some of the rather unique leadwork heard on Leprosy.\n\nUnfortunately, these slower parts are in the minority as Schuldiner only realized their power later on. A lot of the album is fast-paced without actually feeling like it. A lot of blame is on the drums, but the unmemorable riffs that seem to just blend into each other carry most of it. Some of them include a sort of gimmick to differentiate from the others, but usually it just doesn't work and ends up sounding artificial. Chuck's vocals are another aspect which is used to try to save them and while he does an impressive job considering the times, it gets rather monotone by the end. However, his long, stretched-out, high-pitched screams are a treat wherever you can spot them.\n\nSo, while there are a lot of differences between Scream Bloody Gore, there are some points where they are alike as well. You have to dig in to find the real gold. Unforunately on Leprosy, it isn't usually focused on just one song, but spread out among them all. You have to listen through a minute or two of lazy death metal to get to the good and ominous part that lasts for barely half a minute. Open Casket and the title track rise above the others as songs that are through and through excellent, but the others just don't cut it.\n",
        "\nIf one were to listen through all of Death\u2019s studio recordings from start to finish the following 5 hours of music would be a steady progression from harsh and raw to crisp and refined, from structurally simplistic and technically complacent to grandiose and virtuosic, with never a detour in quality. From their early days as a of source of sonic bludgeoning to this, their final album the changes have been immense; yet Chuck Schuldiner remains the key factor and the defining element, managing to release no two identical albums while maintaining a definitive path throughout. \n\nThe final installment in the Death discography sees a totally different line-up than its successor, Symbolic. Gene Hoglan moved on to Strapping Young Lad and was replaced by Richard Christy and Scott Clendenin on bass and Shannon Hamm on guitar round out the lineup. The shift from Hoglan to Christie is undoubtedly one of the key changes, as Hoglan was the foundation of the two albums most directly related to The Sound and is, of course, a god among mere mortals. Christie rightly tackles this project as a his own and not in the shadow of the Atomic Clock and aside from being a fully capable drummer was perhaps an even better fit for Chuck and his traditional/power metal leanings. What Christie brings, or rather what comes out through Christie, is a more driving, less punctuated rhythmic approach, galloping along with an almost merry temperament. The effect of this shift is a livlier, more predictable base for Chuck\u2019s catchy, approachable brand of progressive metal. Christie isn\u2019t quite the artist Gene is but he\u2019s no slouch and his percussive persistence probably allowed the music to become exactly what Chuck had been working towards all those years. \n\nTruthfully, even by the time of Human Chuck\u2019s tastes had changed. He didn\u2019t really like the death metal of the day, found much of it to be mindless, speed-crazed silliness, and was trying desperately to distance himself from the \u201cEvil Chuck\u201d image the band\u2019s name did little to contradict. It would be less of a stretch to say this wasn\u2019t at all the same band anymore than it would be to say the opposite, and 15 years and 432 band members later Chuck saw himself as one of the few who still stood for metal in a time when metal only stood for \u201cbrutality\u201d. He had already started putting together his next band, Control Denied, the process of which had brought him Christie, and was adamant about the role and necessity of melody in a music that had become dominated by indecipherable growls and distorted atonal churning. Much of the material found here was actual meant for the upcoming Control Denied album but was reworked for Death to fulfill contractual obligations. It\u2019s not that this album was forced \u2013 the ideas are as fresh and vitally infused as anything before or after, it just wasn\u2019t exactly what Chuck planned to be doing at the time. \n\nThe most obvious clue to this overlapping of interests is the vocals, which are the most clear and crisp the man would ever divulge and a noticeable shift even from Symbolic. They\u2019d been moving in this direction since all the way back on Spiritual Healing but here they really bite and are more vicious than ever. Some decry the shift from the early voice, which was a trademark sound of the origins of death metal, but these piercing cries are a feat rarely matched in any field of metal. While they generally sit in a coarse, throaty bark they can ascend to shrill heights and attain truly chilling effect. \n\nThe remaining ingredients more subtly belie Chuck\u2019s interest in traditional heavy metal but nonetheless bring its fruit to bear. Overall, this album can be seen as a successor to Symbolic, but to see it only as that is to miss its unique place on the metal spectrum. Here the melodic aspects are, if not more developed, more prominent. The guitar tone is wire-thin and has a slightly juiced-up reverb; it stands apart more so than any prior Death effort and is very reminiscent of the early days of metal and the dominance of the guitar. This sonic separation comes alongside further integration of melody into the songwriting, something Symbolic had only begun to do. The ratio of two-guitar, rhythmic riffs to single-axe melodic leads is the lowest in the whole catalogue and the most time seems to have been spent crafting these winding, spiraling, dancing licks, which represent themes, embellishments, transitions and interludes and are not limited in their scope nearly at all. While at times this can edge towards superfluity the seemingly infallible melodic aptitude of the composer assures every phrase and every run of at least some merit and a good many of them of unforgettable status. \n\nFor the death metal devotees among us, the music here could be somewhat disappointing: it feels so much more than its predecessors like a transition to something else, something other than Death. Where Symbolic had a plethora of heavy, powerful riffs, The Sound subsists on a different diet and the death metal elements here are certainly out of the spotlight. That being said, this album is less cluttered, is neater; it\u2019s easier to remember songs in their entirety despite a continuing attention to the nuances of song composition and progression. The same clarity of vision is present, there are simply fewer individual pieces at play, a trait which I\u2019ll refrain from characterizing as either a positive or a negative and leave simply as a distinguishing, the distinguishing, factor. \n\nPerhaps a direct result of this, or perhaps an effect sharing with it a cause, is the real, practical shortcoming of this final album, that it has songs that just don\u2019t quite make it. Amazingly, this is probably the first such album from Death. The aesthetic differences are incremental, if substantial, and the structural elements remain top notch. But, songs like \u201cStory to Tell\u201d and \u201cA Moment of Clarity\u201d never deliver the punch line. There are plenty of hooks on the album, but not nearly the ridiculous amount on either of the past two nor quite the consistency of the two prior to those. With durations exceeding 6 minutes, that ends up coloring the whole record. As strong as \u201cBite the Pain\u201d, \u201cSpirit Crusher\u201d and the monumental \u201cFlesh and the Power It Holds\u201d are they can\u2019t conceal the thinness of their comrades. It\u2019s a testament to the prodigious capabilities of Chuck that this album is, despite this, great. \n\nBut even here we might be selling him short. This isn\u2019t just a great album; it\u2019s unique. It didn\u2019t have the influence of Leprosy or Human and it didn\u2019t spawn a genre like Scream Bloody Gore or Individual Thought Patterns but it does stand firmly in between disparate realms, between progressive death, technical thrash and power/heavy metal as it does between the new metal and the old metal. That it may not be definitive with regards to these relationships doesn\u2019t diminish its singularity or steadfastness of vision. And now, 25 years on from the birth of that wonderful thing we call death metal, after countless diversions, imitations, mutations and bastardizations, regardless of our interest in Judas Priest or Dio or clean vocals we should be very acutely tuned to the presence, in any form, of the spirit of classic metal. It was devotion to this spirit that gave us thrash, that gave us death, that gave us all the \u201cextreme\u201d metals in their various forms. And it\u2019s the vanishing of that spirit that signals the end for any variation on these themes. Chuck knew that all along and in him and in Death we have an enduring monument to the necessity of that thought.\n\nWritten for www.leprousgarden.com\n",
        "\nThis was the first album by Death that I ever heard. Until this point I had never heard anything quite like this. I had never heard such fast drumming, such harsh vocals and such brutal riffs all put together as one, AND I LOVED IT. This album is what introduced me to Death, and to the entire death metal genre in general. This album shows Death\u2019s evolution from their earlier more primitive works (Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy, not that those are bad albums it\u2019s just that this is better). \n\nMan, they definitely could not have picked a better song to start this album off that Living Monstrosity. The opening riff to that song is just amazing. It\u2019s fast and just grabs you and forces you to listen, the best part is you\u2019re glad you did! Altering the Future is another cool song, not a highlight but a good song overall. Defensive Personalities, what a song, my favourite part is the riff when Chuck says \u201cDefensive Person Al I TEEES!!!\u201d it\u2019s so awesome. And if Defensive Personalities wasn\u2019t enough then Within the Mind will surely show you that Death means business. Really catchy chorus, a true highlight. \n\nNow comes the monster of a song known as Spiritual Healing. This song is so good that it deserves its own individual paragraph. This song starts off with a classical sounding riff that sounds like something that would be played on an organ in a church, at around 20 seconds in the heaviest riff ever kicks in. And then, the vocals. Oh man Chuck was an awesome vocalist. After the first verse the song picks up and starts to get fast, this is an example of Chuck\u2019s amazing song writing. Making a song have an incredibly heavy and crushing riff at the beginning and then picking up to get really fast. Another classical riff kicks in a little bit later and then Chuck says \u201cSPIRITUAAAAAL HEEEEEALING!\u201d after which you are bombarded with an amazing guitar solo which goes straight into the heavy crushing riff from the beginning. A truly amazing song, definitely one of Death\u2019s best songs ever. \n\nAfter a song like Spiritual Healing you would think it would be hard to top . But they manage it! Low Life, Genetic Reconstruction and Killing Spree are 3 death metal classics. All with awesomely cool riffs and amazing choruses. After hearing this album you\u2019ll be having the chorus from Genetic Reconstruction going around and around in your head (\u201cGenetic Reconstruction, evolution in production!\u201d). \n\nAll in all this is an amazing album. I would recommend it to any fan of Death, Death Metal or Metal in general\n\nHighlights\n-\tLiving Monstrosity\n-\tDefensive Personalities \n-\tSPIRITUAL HEALING\n-\tAnd last but not least, Genetic Reconstruction\n",
        "\nThis album has only two views from fans of Death. Either that they despise and call it wank or they love it. I hold the latter opinion in that little debacle, as you can obviously tell from my ridiculously high score.\n\nAlright, well, I'll start off with the very few cons. \n\nFirstly, the lack of outrageous bass patterns saddens me. Though Scott created a very good set of lines, and performed them skillfully and had stage presence, he could've played some more interesting bass solos/lines. For instance, even though I love the intro Spirit Crusher...it isn't much beyond the first guitar riff. \n\nSecondly, and lastly, the Painkiller cover. Even though I think Chuck had a ridiculously good voice on this song I just didn't like it...the near monotous Halford vocals are gone and that slightly angers me. It just doesn't sound that right, to me.\n\nNow, onto the good parts of the album. Quite a few at that. \n\nThe guitar sound? For Chuck and co. to be using solid state amps, this album has rather good guitar tone. A perfect crisp punch without leaving out the powerful bass presences. The leads are enhanced by chorus and reverb pedals, thus giving them intensly spacey and melodic vibes. The riffing is incredible, shifting from the now necessary Death pedal point riffing to the straightforward powerchord-chug-power chord formula reminiscent of any Death song. \n\nThe riffs...OH THE RIFFS. I'm normally not one to orgasm mentally over riffs, but these riffs are so good and so solid that I can't help but point them out. Many people claim this album lacks substantial riffing as it is \"technical wankery\" but this album is honestly chock-full of nasty riffs. Particulary in songs like A Moment of Clarity and Spirit Crusher. Then the solos...standard Chuck fare, tapping occaisional mini-sweeps and lots of melodic minor shredding. My favorites.\n\nThe guitarist for this album, and the Control Denied album, Shannon Hamm is a good guitarist. He manages to do well enough when called upon in studio but his live performance is horrid. The only thing that redeems him is his energy on stage.\n\nNow, onto the bass. Fairly prominent, and very good. Look up at the cons for my disagreements on the basslines.\n\nAnyways, the drums. Many people attest Gene Hoglan to be the best Death drummer, but after inspections of this album it is easily proven that Richard Christy flays any attempt by Gene. His ridiculously technical patterns into simple D beat stuff into the usual metal double bass pattern form is extremely effective on this album. He never goes off time and his fills and accuracy are completely professional.\n\nThen, the lyrics. We stumble upon what most call the idiotic part of later Death. But, to be honest, these are Chuck's most truthful lyrics and show through a more \"real\" image of the main man. They vary from spirituality topics to those of the unknown, the dead, and stories of fictional creatures. \n\nRelated to the lyrics is the songwriting. Many people push off this albums writing as too pretentious and that is fairly justified as this album is rather progressive. Though, what is not justified is calling the album shit because of that. The songwriting is still comprehensive of death metal and adopts the conveniences of progressive metal and power metal.\n\nNearly finally, the vocals. Chuck shifted vocal styles rapidly throughout the years of Mantas and Death. Originally formatting a raspy growl to his liking, he changed in five years to a slightly higher shriek which eventually led to the vocals on this album. As the goddess said previously, they are like razors. The vocals pierce and screech their way through the album, never letting any tension go. On occaisions Chuck can be heard letting lose his full body through the mic (see: Spirit Crusher's ending choruses).\n\nNow it's finally the production values. The album is produced with a perfect mix. Rarely does one find a perfect death metal album in terms of mixing. The few that there are include: Cannibal Corpse's The Wretched Spawn, Incantion's Onward to Golgatha, this album, and Deicide's Legion. When you get perfectly mixed albums like those you hear damn near musical perfection. Every instrument is perfectly high in the mix, even the bass. The vocals are rather loud, but do not intrude on the music.\n\nWell, that's about it from me. I recommend this album if you are a fan of death metal with progressive tendencies and power metal shrieking. \n\nBest songs? Honestly, all of them, though Story to Tell and Spirit Crusher hold rather high places. No bad songs, in my mind either.\n",
        "\nDeath epitomize death metal. The perfect combination of pure brutality, guitar pyrotechnics, those oft-maligned cheesy vocals, and of course, the wildly varied lyrics, can be found in any of their releases. Reign Of Terror was the first studio recording by the newly-rechristened band, who at this point featured Chuck Schuldiner on guitar and vocals, Rick Rozz on guitars, and Kam Lee on drums and vocals. During Kam\u2019s tenure, he did most of the vocals since Chuck, Satan love him, could only muster a death growl that pretty much bore similarities to a pubescent dark angel. \n\n1984 was a major year for metal. Venom had exploded onto the scene in 1981-82 and were the gold standard for brutality in metal, Hellhammer had their demos going in the underground and were quickly making Venom sound dated, thrash was all the rage, and Death\u2019s competitors for the death metal throne, Possessed, were getting their shit together with a demo of their own. Chuck was quite the listener, it seems, for Reign of Terror, unleashed into the maelstrom of extreme metal that existed in 1984, took the best parts of the aforementioned entities and put them together into a vicious blend. Reign of Terror is more death/thrash than pure death metal, unless of course you\u2019re one of those virgin death metal fans who think that the growls define the music. The riffs are the dead giveaway \u2013 brutal tremolo-picked monstrosities played at a speed not even Possessed dared to go.\n\nThe songs are among the finest of the early days of Death, with the one-two punch of Corpsegrinder and Summoned To Die opening the demo on a great note. Corpsegrinder might very well have been the most extreme metal recording released in 1984; it is one of the most unrelentingly fast songs Death ever did, with a main riff that laid the blueprint for death metal. The rest of the demo is equally insistent. Every riff is a classic of the genre, with Witch of Hell and Slaughterhouse also standing out. There isn\u2019t much in the area of flashy soloing; what\u2019s here gets the job done, and well at that. Chuck and Rick make a great two-headed guitar monster when Chuck\u2019s not soloing. Kam\u2019s not the best drummer in the world, but his work here is decent at best. His vocals are what really stand out \u2013 no one sounded as fucked up as this in 1984, and I dare say ever since. These aren\u2019t \u201cdeath growls\u201d, these are inhuman roars, something even Chuck wouldn\u2019t make an effort to recreate when Kam left, instead opting to sound like Jeff Becerra.\n\nAnd of course, no 1980s death metal demo is complete without the totally hideous production values. Reign of Terror is one big wall of fuzz with guitars and drums fighting to break through the mess, and it\u2019s a thousand times better because of it. Death metal is not supposed to be palatable; it\u2019s fucking supposed to sound like shit. Chuck would go on to greener pastures sonically with his band, but Death never bettered the sheer \u201ckvltness\u201d, if you will, of these early demos, and Reign of Terror is the Death masterpiece, and the best release to ever come out of the death metal genre. This is an absolutely required release for anyone who calls themselves a death metal fan.\n",
        "\nWhen \u201cfaith healer\u201d Peter Popoff was ousted as a fraud in the late 1980s by Johnny Carson\u2019s Tonight Show, a plethora of metal bands were quick to jump on the anti-televangelist bandwagon. When Death\u2019s junior release, Spiritual Healing was released in 1990 with a now-infamous album cover featuring a man with uncanny resemblances to Peter Popoff \u201chealing\u201d a cancerous woman while an eccentric group of Bible-thumping zealots donate insensate praise, it was obvious that Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s Death was blossoming into something different. \n\nThis period in Death\u2019s career is typically defined by large amounts of bickering and betrayal. James Murphy was brought in to record guitar on Spiritual Healing, but was fired shortly after for ambiguous reasons. Chuck called off the album\u2019s intended tour, leaving the remaining two members of the band (Terry Butler and Bill Andrews) in something of an irked state. Without informing Chuck, the two embarked on a tour of Europe with Walt Trachsler (from Texas\u2019 underground sensation, Rotting Corpse) and some dude named Louie Carrisalez, and this tour was marketed as a Death tour. Upon hearing the news, Chuck was infuriated, and rightfully so\u2013after all, Death was his brainchild, his creative endeavour; without him in the picture, Death wasn\u2019t Death. Legal recourse was taken, and Chuck felt obligated to give Butler and Andrews the boot. No evidence of this period of inner squalor can be found on what would make up Spiritual Healing\u2019s final product, however, and it was, at the time, Death\u2019s strongest LP. \n\nA complete stylistic evolution hadn\u2019t taken place since the last album; a great deal of this album\u2019s stylistic components were borrowed from the previous two albums, with a selection of subtle nuances created by the augmentation in production value. However, these moments are scattered almost intermittently throughout. Spiritual Healing is, by and large responsible for the direction death metal would take for years after its release. The concepts Death presented early on served as blueprints for the genre, but Spiritual Healing meshed the unprovoked whirlwind of brooding ferocity found throughout the band\u2019s first two records with a newfound sense of mechanics and stunning, albeit few and far between, bursts of antipodean melody, often occurring during guitar solos and brief guitar-driven interludes. \u201cWithin the Mind\u201d presents itself as something of an epicentre for these ideas; the hypnotic intro, almost Middle-Easternly tinged, juxtapositions the chugging uphill struggle that resides in the dominating guitar riff. The song\u2019s premier guitar solo is similar to the opening lick in that it constructs an incomparable aura of both delicacy and forewarning. As the speed rises, the theme of intricacy and experimentation becomes more apparent. \n\nSong lengths had become longer as well, all of which were upwards of four minutes long. Chuck clearly had more to say musically. The majority of the guitar riffs are broken down and explored thoroughly. The validity of this album\u2019s revered sense of progression is undeniable. \u201cLow Life\u201d begins as a seedy and haunting mid-tempo piece, but eventually turns into something quicker (but equally haunting still) before launching itself back into mid-tempo territory. The variety of guitar riffs throughout this one song is staggering; the number of different guitar leads and riffs in this song alone outweigh the riffs found in an entire Lamb of God album. And this is how the entire album presents itself. Each song is something new and unique, and in the realm of guitar innovation for its release in 1990, is beyond thought, especially for extreme metal. This album is also an absolute powerhouse in the way of shredding. Both Schuldiner and Murphy are in top form here, and given that this is one of Murphy\u2019s earliest recorded works, this is all the more impressive. \n\nAlas, the musical innovation on this album is unique to only the guitar. Terry Butler\u2019s bass guitar follows the rhythm guitar for 95% of the album, and it isn\u2019t really audible to begin with. Bill Andrews is a talented drummer; he can play fast, and he does some pretty nifty things with his bass pedal, but not once does he overstep the circumscribed rhythmic boundaries. There is absolutely zero rhythmic experimentation here. Death would become known for intricate bass guitar and drum work, but there are nearly no traces of these things on Spiritual Healing. This is a guitar-driven album through and through. \n\nWhile far from the pinnacle of Death\u2019s lyrical achievements, Spiritual Healing is vastly far removed from its two predecessors. The theme of gratuitous brutal violence has been almost completely dropped in favour of a more socially aware political commentary. The lyrical content ranges from the effects substance abuse can have an unborn foetus in \u201cLiving Monstrosity\u201d (The beginning of the end begins at birth/Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh ), to dissociative identity disorder in \u201cDefensive Personalities\u201d (One mind divided into three, for every problem a personality), but the theme of social awareness is prevalent in each song. \n\nThe production, courtesy of mastermind Scott Burns is clear, if a little flawed. As mentioned, the bass is too low in the mix, and it would have been nice to have it brought a little closer to the forefront. The raw death metal sound of Death\u2019s previous two albums is pretty much gone. The sound may be flawed, but for a early-90s death metal album, it is pretty damn satisfactory. Scott Burns had only produced a handful of albums by this point, a lot of which would eventually graduate to legend status (Obituary\u2019s Slowly We Rot and Cause of Death, Deicide\u2019s self-titled and Sepultura\u2019s Beneath the Remains to name a few), and he would eventually develop into one of the greatest metal producers of all time. \n\nThis album often gets ignored, largely due to the fact that it was followed by Death\u2019s \u201cbreakthrough\u201d album, Human which went on to be one of the most revered albums in metal history. Regardless, Spiritual Healing is mandatory listening for any fan of death metal. It represents a pivotal time in the growth of a genre that would spawn into something massive.\n",
        "\nI have always been a fan of Death, owning everything by the band, I have had a good listen to all of their music. This particular album, \"Symbolic,\" however, is by far my favorite work by them. Death made a complete turn in their sound with this album, primarily vocal-wise, changing from normal death metal grunts all the way to thrash metal/black metal like screaming from Kreator or Sodom. This change, however, did not upset me, nor did it upset the fans, in fact, it has impressed them.\n\nChuck is brilliant in this album, combining anger/brutality with beautiful atmosphere, Chuck has proven himself to be an exceptional vocalist. His volume and tone are beyond perfect, becoming more intense, and beautiful than ever before.\n\nThe guitar work in this album sounds nearly orchestral. Death metal music is well known because of the dark symphonic classical music influence. Nowhere is this more noticeable than in Symbolic, primarily in the track \"Crystal Mountain,\" the guitar solos sounding like a metalized Wagner symphony.\n\nThe drum work in this album seems to consist of mainly blast beats, which after a while can get boring by just merely paying attention to the drums, but when looking at the album as a whole together, it blends in beautifully and supporting the atmosphere displayed in this album ever more vibrant and intense.\n\nThis album, all in all, is beautifully made with perfect guitar work and vocals, and great drumming. This is a must listen for any death metal connoisseur , and is guaranteed to not disappoint.\n",
        "\nDeath's 6th full-length studio album, \"Symbolic\". Now near the end of the Death discography, with one more to go, I am reviewing this album and just wondering \"how the fuck does this band keep going?\" Like, honestly this band has made more changes in sound than any other band I have ever heard. The thing is though... Every time they change their sound, it ends up being so good, if not better than the previous. It's amazing. Death is a band that people should worship. They should look at Death and see Metal. They are the masters. The Gods. \n\n\nThe first track of the album is the title track, \"Symbolic\", a brilliant intro song, starts of slower, and ends up clocking in at about six and a half minutes. This is Death's Progressive stage and it really shows up on this song. Odd time signatures, lengthy track, technicality, multiple sound changes, you know, that old chestnut. Death has truly done a great job turning into a Progressive Death Metal band. They successfully got into it without destroying themselves completely, which would understandably be very hard to do.\n\n\nThe guitar is too good to explain. But I'll try to the best of my ability. Fast as fuck, very well placed, well paced, spectacular solos, very technical, incredible. There is a lot of variety in the album. The song \"Empty Words\" is an example of some changes you can see as Death progressed into the Progressive genre. The intro starts with slow guitar, leading into a heavy drum/guitar altercation and you're hit with an odd time signature. Now check out \"Misanthrope\", which takes you back to classic Death. One of the fastest fucking things I have ever heard, the guitar just kicks your ass. Yet it is like older Death, you are still hit with the fact that it is more technical and cleaner. Technicality and cleanliness are next to Godliness. The guitar on the album is just... Perfect.\n\n\nI don't even need to comment on Chuck's vocals. They need no introduction. The best vocalist I have ever heard. No question. This man has held onto the same vocal for so long... I cannot believe how he did it. There must be some explanation. Everything he does is just perfect. His vocals are superb.\n\n\nThe bass on this album is spectacular. The intro to \"Sacred Serenity\" blew me away. It has changed yet again though. Now I feel like it has a more technical feel, and it is not as loud on this album. It does a perfect job of being in perfect volume. Loud enough to hear, but not loud enough as to drown out everything else.\n\n\nThe drums for Death I think has been it's biggest change. I don't know how the man does it. Some of the most technical drums I have ever heard. Very good, amazing sound. Perfect volume. Odd time signatures blossom, and are done flawlessly. Truly incredible.\n\n\nNow, this is a fucking masterpiece. I cannot think of anything wrong with it. Tons of variety, you're treated with tons of different styles. That's what make this album so great. The fact that these guys keep making insane albums without ever getting dull is awesome. I don't know how to explain the band Death. Gods. Just... Gods. I truly recommend that you pick up this album. If you're disappointed... Pfff, yeah right.\n",
        "\nDeath returns in 1993 with \"Individual Thought Patterns\". Now, a couple things to start off with. This time around, Death has changed directions again from \"Human\". It is now not as heavy, and has gone back to the original sound. The main difference in the technicality though. Although \"Human\" was technical and heavy, I take this new album as just technical and great. Not as heavy, but it makes up for it with variation and technicality. \n\n\nThe guitar work is great. It's even got a melodic sense on top of being on an odd time signature. Great, great combination. Death is a band that I believe that I believe they could make any album they wanted, and make it sound good. Through lots of sound changes, they still manage to pull off remarkable albums. Each new album comes in with something new, or even something old and make a piece of art out of it. It's truly amazing, this band. They do not get enough credit. Not at all. Back to the guitars. The solos on the album are top-notch. There are two things that make a solo for me. The solo, obviously, and the guitar work behind it, the rhythm, I mean. These two coupled together can make the greatest sound ever. Death has made this possible on this record. Listen to the solo at about the second minute of \"Trapped In A Corner\" and you'll see what I mean. Great leads, awesome solos, a variety, odd timing, like I have said before. Just great.\n\n\nThe bass is one of the new/old things I mean. It has come back, as to say, and is now loud again, but not too loud as to drown out the guitar, and it works really well. Really good, technical, clean and great audibility. This is a band that truly knows how to make a superb record. They are a band that can make anything sound just... Remarkable. I don't understand.\n\n\nThe drums are ridiculous. They are just... Such a step up. Proficient. The vocals are again, superb. I can't even say much else because... I just am lost for words. Awesome album, no question. It's quite weird for me, I have never experienced a band that gets better with every album. This is a great band. Truly one of the best.\n",
        "\nHoly fucking shit! When you first turn on Death's \"Human\", you are greeted with three new things. 1) The use of toms, 2) The sheer heaviness, and 3) Odd time signatures. Now, this should say a lot to the old Death.\n\nOk, now since I am blown away, I am going to start with the drums! And what a fucking surprise! THEY ARE TECHNICAL and they are DIFFERENT! There is a lot of great variation on this album, drum wise. Very, very well done, they are crisp, loud, and technical, and best of all, they keep you going, and they don't make you feel like you're hearing the same song over and over again, trying to figure out which fucking song is playing. I.E. They are not boring, they are brilliant, and a highlight, a big highlight, of this album. I would even say they are thrashy, rather, thrashy, in some parts anyways, like in the songs \"Vacant Plants\" and \"See Through Dreams\".\n\nThe guitar on the album can be defined with two words: technical and heavy. No doubt in my mind that this is, so far, Death's most technical and heavy record yet. I couldn't believe that it was Death that I was hearing. It's awesome. The solos are insane. EVERY song on the entire album has a solo on it. There is not one stale or boring moment on this whole album.\n\nThe vocals are just... God damn, this man is a beast. Seriously one of the best vocalists I have ever heard in my entire life. The vocals are just as you'd expect. Perfect.\n\nThe bass has the same effect on me as the previous album does. It's quieter, but it allows the guitars to maintain their clean technical quality while still being loud enough to hear and appreciate. Not much else to say about the bass.\n\nOverall, my favorite Death album. This is just... It's perfect. There is not one thing I do not like about this album. I seriously recommend this album to any Metal fan. It's one of the greatest Death Metal albums of all time. Just.. Wow...\n",
        "\nThe first thing I think when I turn on this album, with the opening track \"Living Monstrosity\" ringing in my ears is, \"Oh yeah, this is Death\". They have such a distinct sound. A sound that is their own. They push this sound even further with the 1990 masterpiece, \"Spiritual Healing\".\n\nOne of the first things I've noticed about this album is that the sound is great. It sounds well made, well produced, and clean. With \"Scream Bloody Gore\", I found it had a messy quality to it, in a good way, like it sounded like it was supposed to be a lower quality. This record doesn't have that, as much anyways, and it brings a new sound to Death's music. Higher quality usually equals better sound, and better sound usually equals an easier to listen to record.\n\nLet's talk about the vocals. This time around the vocals are perfect volume and are greatly in tune with the drums and guitars volume. As one thing you will notice, just like I did, the vocals sound exactly like the previous records. It's quite awesome that Chuck can maintain the exact same vocal on each record so well, almost as if they were recorded all in one day, and put them on different records. Now for me, one of the biggest things that made me love Death was the fact that Chuck's vocals are so good. And when Death puts almost identical vocals on each record it makes me very happy. \n\nGuitar, shall we? Well, I have to say the guitar went from simple, heavy and great, to a little more technical, heavier, and greater. The song \"Spiritual Healing\" is the prime example. A good thing about Death's first two records is that fact that they can have a primitive sound, and rather simple guitar, and be completely amazing. But now, you have this record that steps it up a notch technically. What do you start to think? Remember that change can be good. In this case it was a right move, in my eyes, because I believe a band's next record should be better than their last, because if it wasn't then, they can really never go anywhere. That's a reason why I love this album, guitar wise. Their notch-up was correct, logical, and it worked.\n\nBass time. This time, the bass is a little bit quieter. Is it audible? Yes. Is it audible enough? That's debatable. I think not. The thing that really got me about the previous albums, especially \"Scream Bloody Gore\" was how loud the bass was. It was the loudest I've ever heard in any band, that's for sure. With \"Spiritual Healing\", I believe if the bass was louder, it wouldn't have sounded as clean as it is, and would have added a lot of extra heaviness that maybe would have drowned out the technicality of the guitar. My opinion. Over all you can hear it, but don't expect it to be very loud like the previous albums.\n\nDrums. Ok, Death's drums, as anyone who has heard the first records, has always been rather simple, and because they are simple, that makes them very repetitive in some cases, making some songs basically just boring. There is a little more variation on this album, and it works to an advantage, for me, anyways. There really isn't much to say on that note, just that it is basically the same old same old.\n\nOk so overall, I think this album is more technical and more heavy in the guitar department, I feel the drums are quite the same old Death drums, I think the bass fits nicely in making the album have a cleaner, more technical feel, yet still being audible, and very clear, and great. Another new thing on the album is the song lengths. That's always a good sign for me, so, it helps as well. The vocals, are as always, very, very good. So basically, we have a different album... That's not so different. \n\nThe album's only weakness I can hear is the drums. Repetitive drums. They are good, of course, don't get me wrong, and there is some variation, but, it doesn't take away the fact that they are, however, repetitive.\n",
        "\nThis is Death's best album. This is the album where Death takes their 'progressiveness' and melds it perfectly with their death metal roots. Individual Thought Patterns also has, in my opinion, the greatest Death line-up. Hoglan and DiGiorgio? Yes please. Chuck's vocals are excellent on this album. They are his greatest, angriest growls.\n\nThis music is intricate and pleasing, and the lyrics are deep and philosophical (even though Chuck appears to have a great disdain towards them. \"You know so much about nothing at all\"). Most of the songs are fairly short, nothing over four and a half minutes. That is the reason this release doesn't get a 100. Chuck is perfectly capable or writing longer opuses as he proves on The Sound of Perseverance. As mentioned previously, these lyrics are deep and amazing. They aren't your typical death metal lyrics (Zombie Ritual anyone?) Gone are the days of images of gore and zombies.\n\nThe technicality of this release is quite astounding for a death metal release, chalked full of eccentric time signatures, and high levels of instrument proficiency. DiGiorgio's bass is highly audible which is always a plus and Hoglan's drums are thunderous and amazing. Also present in Individual Thought Patterns is the use of harmonized guitars, something that Chuck thankfully brought from Human. Those harmonies are brutal, yet highly technical and just downright catchy. There isn't a boring/unmemorable riff anywhere in this album.\n\nThe highlights of this album are 'The Philosopher' and 'Trapped in a Corner.' Both are as 'epic' as a death metal song can be, and are Death's best songs since Lack of Comprehension or Pull the Plug.\n\nIn short, if you're a fan of complex, intricate progressive death metal with intelligible, deep lyrics, then pick up this album. If you're a huge fan of simple \"chugga-chugga\" death metal with over-the-top lyrics about gore and stupidity, then stay away. This music will overheat your brain and infuriate you, causing you to go on a rampage and destroy Tokyo.\n",
        "\nFor the longest time, I was a card carrying member of the Leprosy-is-a-boring-fucking-record club, but I have recently been converted. The riffs that were boring to me a few months ago, have now become powerful and intense. The songs that plodded and lacked direction have transformed into primal death metal riff monsters. All this record needs is time, and I can now almost understand where the whole \"instant gratification\" criticism for most modern tech death bands comes from.\n\nChuck's vocal style was still in the primitive death shout stage as of the year 1988, but it sounds just as good as it did on Scream Bloody Gore. The evolution of his voice wouldn't truly begin until Human, but I am a firm believer that every style he's used throughout the years are executed perfectly. What's even more mind blowing, is when the realization that all of Death's elements have been there since the beginning hits a young'un like myself. I was introduced to Death with Symbolic, so I was a fan of the later works for the longest time, I essentially worked backwards when it came to this band. I find this actually worked to my advantage and allowed me to appreciate Leprosy more than I would have before. Some of the riffs from The Sound of Perseverance sound like reworked riffs from the title track here and Open Casket. What this serves as is an everlasting testament to Chuck Schuldiner's ability, as it has always been there, it just happened to show up in different magnitudes on different albums.\n\nEnough of the Merlin-esque backwards history, let's enjoy ourselves some headbangin'. One of the adjectives I find myself continually using when it comes to describing Leprosy is \"primitive\". This is one of the most raw slabs of aggression I've heard put to tape. When I say raw, I don't mean it in the way people describe Transylvanian Hunger, I mean it is unadulterated, dirty, unfiltered, and yet at the same time pure, heavy, and domineering. The hatred, the misanthropia, it is all here in force. The attitude is the most prevalent thing here, even when the songwriting isn't horribly strong. Listen to the latter half of Left to Die, the double bass just obliterates everything in front of it. It's this intensity and focus that brings this album above other early death metal acts, and further cements Death's reputation for being one of the most consistently great bands in metal history.\n\nAll that said, this album isn't perfect. A few songs are far from memorable, and there are more than a few weak riffs. I'd say the weakest track here is probably Forgotten Past, but it's still a great song, so that just goes to show you.... Anyways, sometimes intensity and aggression isn't enough to ride on alone, the songwriting needs to be there just as strongly. For the most part it is, but it isn't the masterwork that is Symbolic, nor is it the pure fury of Scream Bloody Gore (although it is indeed pretty fucking close). I find it hard to verbalize my gripes with the album, but it is indeed a flawed work, an unfurnished jewel if you will.\n\nLeprosy is another solid Death release, but at the same time it is one of their most pedestrian. This and Spiritual Healing are a bit middle-of-the-road in comparison to their other works, but this is just as worthy of the name as Human or Symbolic. And considering this isn't even in the better half of Death's records, it STILL scores an A-, just another monument to their incredible consistency on the whole. It's not for everybody, as Death is a band that has gone through almost innumerable lineup changes and progressions in sound. Fans of Scream Bloody Gore will eat this up, and any early death metal fan who hasn't heard this should remedy that immediately, or just leave the hall.\n",
        "\nDeath has always been one of my favorite bands and a band I consider one of the best in old school death metal. From the early releases like Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy as well as the few demos or rehearsals of their many i have been lucky to come across from their early days, all the way to their most famous and widely considered best work with \"Human\" the band has been one that is recognized as both one of the best early death metal acts and musically one of the most powerful forces out there in the scene during the early 90s, perfecting the genre to an absolute art.\n\nHowever it's evident even on this album Death realized that had maxed out their potential with Human. Individual Thought Patterns had a lot to follow up on after an album that is widely considered among most metal circles to have been arguably one of the best albums produced by the genre, and as such many have been left disappointed by this album. The album does have moments where it gets boring. The songwriting itself as has been said is more a formula you could teach in math class with standard verse chorus verse chorus sort of riffing going on. The album does pick up on some tracks like parts of \"Nothing is Everything\" but as a whole unit the album definitely has many points it lacks from it's predecessors.\n\nBut regardless this is definitely not an album to neglect or one that should be tossed aside after being casted in the shadow of Human which has brought much of its negativity to it. The riffs themselves and the musicianship as a whole keeps getting progressively better with this band. Musically speaking the album is very solid to the point that this underrated album can actually compare or be considered better than many albums in the death metal genre past and present. The music itself is definitely up there with some of the best material both by Death and by most other bands in the genre that the album shouldn't simply be looked down upon because it doesn't reach the same potential that Human did. For that reason this album is still worth checking out and getting, even though you shouldn't expect it to be as amazing as some of their previous stuff. Consider it as a single death metal album or just a stand alone Death album though and it's much easier to appreciate as a whole.\n",
        "\nI'd like to think that Death continually progressed throughout their career to a sound further and further away from their death metal roots while still retaining integrity and songwriting abilities. And for the most part, they did, the only blemish in the progression is the very end, The Sound of Perseverance. It's hard to describe this without either sounding like a pretentious dicknose or a raving fanboy, so forgive me if I seem to fluctuate in my opinions.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a logical continuation in the progression that began with Human back in 1991, but in the songwriting department, it's a step down from 1995's masterful Symbolic. The songwriting tends to take a back seat to technical showmanship more so than ever on this record. It's a rut that many bands with proficient musicians fall victim to, and Death is no exception. Songs like A Moment of Clarity or Story to Tell aren't very memorable like other tracks in the past and on this album. There is no denying that the musicianship is top notch, as evidenced by the copious mindlblowing solos and drum fills. Chuck's vocals once again got higher, a trend that began years beforehand. This time, they range from a high pitched shriek to the ear piercing wail on the cover of Judas Priest's timeless classic, Painkiller. Richard Christy, who would later gain fame on The Howard Stern Show, is a worthy replacement to Gene Hoglan and is just as competent on the kit as the 600 pound behemoth.\n\nBut as I said, the lack of memorable melodies, riffs, vocal lines, or things of that sort mar the mathematically wonderful record. Story to Tell has completely pointless and random stops throughout it that do nothing but annoy me. Scavenger of Human Sorrow, while being a technical showcase to behold, is completely forgettable, as is To Forgive is to Suffer and A Moment of Clarity. Flesh and the Power it Holds meanders in the middle for far too long and could be the best song on the record if it was a minute or two shorter.\n\nDon't get me wrong, The Sound of Perseverance is far from being a bad album, in fact it is quite great. Bite the Pain and Spirit Crusher are probably the only two songs that are amazing from start to finish (barring the final cover). Both of them also hold two of my favorite riffs on the album (0:42 in the former and 2:32 in the latter), which is proof that Chuck still possesses some of the magic from the previous records. Flesh and the Power it Holds contains also what I may consider one of the most perfect riffs of all time, the verse riff, as I feel like moving every time I hear it, which is what a great riff is supposed to do. Voice of the Soul is a great instrumental as well, with some stunning dual guitar melodies that actually drip with emotion.\n\nSad to say though, the last track is probably the highlight of the album. Painkiller is, to me, hands down the best Judas Priest song ever penned. Now, when one of my favorite bands decides to cover it at a higher speed and with even more blood curdling shrieks, you get one of the best covers of all time. Chuck struggles with the sweep patterns at the beginning of the first solo, which is slightly shocking considering his chops. I can understand why some would abhor this, but I find it to be one of the coolest things I've ever heard. Whether this or the original is better is still open for judgment, but you cannot convince me that the vocal performance isn't one of Schuldiner's best.\n\nSo to wrap up, this is a technical powerhouse with solos and melodies forced up your ass every ten seconds, but by the end of the album, only a couple forced rams will still be resonating in your presumably throbbing anus. By no means bad, but a noticeable step down in the memorability and respinability department from the last few endeavors. A B to Death. Recommended to fans of Death's later work, and whatever genre you want to consider this (\"extreme progressive metal\"? or some wankery like that).\n",
        "\nMost fans of Death remember them for their classics from the glory days of the early to mid-80s Florida scene. While I love a good Zombie Ritual chanting session as good as the rest, this sort of mentality often will quickly lead a fan to abandon their favorite band the minute they start to either grow as musicians or begin repeating themselves. Like every sub-genre in the great metal umbrella, it was death metal\u2019s turn to grow and branch out into new territory, and who better to do it than the band that carries the name of the genre they helped pioneer.\n\nBeing as this is the album that first introduced me to the band years back, naturally my perspective on death metal is tilted towards the technical side, my personal love for progressive metal and thrash also being taken into account. The many changes in tempo, the dozen or so riffs and multiple lead-breaks that funnel in and out of the song, and the lack of any boundaries apart from the limits of Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s metaphysical awareness all appeal to the riff and change-up enthusiast. But what really strikes me about this 10 song work is the tightness of the songwriting and the arrangement, which pushes forward with the fury of a raging bull, yet with the discipline of a well trained soldier.\n\nThe songs themselves are not terribly long, and the total length of the album is about equal to that of their early material. However, each one of these 3 to 4 minute long songs listen like a 6 or 7 minute long song. Some view this as a negative and would attribute this to over-development and deviating too much from the traditional formula that the band used in their early years, but I see it more as the same brilliance with which artists can make a 2 dimensional illustration seem 3 dimensional with a simply manipulation of size and placement. \u201cNothing is Everything\u201d is only slightly longer than 3 minutes, but every time I finish listening to it I feel like I\u2019ve experienced something similar to Maiden\u2019s longer winded compositions.\n\nSurprising enough as it may be, my 2 favorite songs of the mix are the ones that are probably the least appreciated by the old guard Death fan base. Being an avid fan of bands who can really throw curveballs to the listener, I was particularly taken by \u201cDestiny\u201d, which sports a rather beautiful acoustic intro with a keyboard of all things, before going through a maze of contrasting sections and elaborate riffs. \u201cThe Philosopher\u201d is the most listener friendly, sporting an easily spotted chorus and the closest thing to a traditional structure on here. When seeing the video with the kid with no shirt running through the forest, you have to wonder if maybe good old Evil Chuck was making a joke out of his similar appearance to famed grunge wanker Eddie Vedder. \n\nThough Schuldiner\u2019s grand collection of riffs and relevant lyrics form the general frame of this colossus, the employment of classic metal mainstay Andy LaRoque is what provides the needed extravagance to bring character and a sense of regality to the mix. Every single solo on here could be described as epic, although the leads to \u201cTrapped in a Corner\u201d just blow me away every time. Picture a massive chorus of barbarians chanting and you have the riffs, and amongst all the masculine aggression is a lone soprano singing pristine melodies, and you\u2019ll get a picture of the perfect contrast that exists between the solos and what surrounds them.\n\nRegardless to what the cynical purists who cling tightly to their original pressings of \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d and their bootlegged copies of their early demos, there is life in death metal after the songs about skull crushing, flesh tearing, and all out dismemberment that make bands like Cannibal Corpse a lyrical joke. You may not be able to tap your foot to this music, and the odd time sections might cause you to throw your neck out of alignment while head banging to them, but this album is jammed tight with inventive and exciting speed and fury. For a metal album that had to contend with legions of brain dead grunge zombies proclaiming our music pass\u00e9, \u201cIndividual Thought Patterns\u201d is about as big of a one fingered salute as you can get to the putrid, ever mutating mainstream.\n",
        "\nThis album is the one that signs a more mature death metal approach for this great band after the crushing, violent Scream Bloody Gore. The over six minutes of the title track is an example of this. Anyway the atmosphere is always rotten, obscure and more morbid than in their previous album. \n\nThe violence of \u201cBorn Dead\u201d with its sudden speed parts and gore mid paced riffs could fit perfectly few years before in the debut. \u201cForgotten Past\u201d is truly brutal with that monstrous parts on up tempo. The solos are more mature and well structured, full of tapped parts. All the riffs are fucking catchy and some more \u201cmelodic\u201d lines are good for the form of the song.\n\nAll the tracks are less impulsive than in the past and the guitar intro to \u201cLeft To Die\u201d can really make us see the Chuck\u2019s improvement in the way of playing the six strings. This track is surely one of my favourites here. Check out the guitar part at 1:30: if there\u2019s a group that could match this in morbidity, I would like to know him. The solo on this song is unbelievable for obscurity and sick melody.\n\nChuck's vocals are always so vicious but this time a bit more growlish than in the past. They are very harsh anyway. They are a trademark; they made history. \u201cPull the Plug\u201d is another total highlight here. The mid paced riffs, the morbid bass drum sound and the ferocious refrain. The guitars riffs at 1:15 is grotesque for its load of sickness, followed by a truly fucking heavy part. \n\n\u201cOpen Casket\u201d is total impact with a terrible/awesome atmosphere of decomposition. The tempo changes from rotten doomy parts and bestial fast ones are well done. Here Chuck literally vomits on the microphone\u2026great! The solos are excellent too. After a more \u201ctechnical\u201d song it\u2019s time for \u201cPrimitive ways\u201d to break in and destroy everything. This one is truly violent with just up tempo or fast bass drum and more simple structures that seem to come out from Scream Bloody Gore! Great!. \n\nThe hyper fast \u201cChoke On It\u201d ends this great death metal album that, without losing anything from the past, has always a foot to the future. From the following Spiritual Healing the progressive influences will break in, leading Death to always more mature sounds but also less \u201ctrue death metal\u201d. So if you love bestiality and evilness in an true death metal album, you must own this.\n",
        "\nIt always seems to me that I am the only guy in this world who thinks this 1990 masterpiece from the legendary Florida based death metal originator is the best album they have ever put out. For some reason, since the day I have heard this album, it has always been very special for me. From the production, to the vocal performence, to the amazing songwriting, this is absolutely perfect. There's no doubt that Death has put out some more complex stuff afterwards, but complex isn't always better. This is the perfect match between old school death metal, with an added touch of what was to come.\n\nStarting the album, Living Monstrosity begins with a simple, but crushing, classic death riff. The lyrics to this song has always amazed me. \"Born without eyes hands, and half a brain, being born addicted to cocaine\". Excellent.\n\nAltering The Future starts with a slow, almost doomy riff. Followed by a weird set of notes, with an inversed drum beat which gives a good feeling, before going into a more straightforward, \"headbangable\" drumbeat and riff. The first solo is what you expect from Mr. Schuldiner. This guy has always had his own style, and it shows even more on this album. The second solo is my favourite ever. The choice of notes is perfect. 3 thumbs up to that.\n\nDefensive Personalities is a fast almost thrashy song, with a slow, anthemic chorus. Very memorable. \"Protecting the weak points of the mind, defensive personalities\". The next riff shows the diversity in Death's music, the drumbeat in the back was mostly unheard in metal back then. But the band managed to keep a dark feel to that part.\n\nWithin The Mind is simply amazing. Not much else to say.. The melody in the middle after the solo at the 2:18 mark is the best ever PERIOD.\n\nThe title track introduces a tapping pattern which Chuck has used alot in future Death albums. A great all-around, long, non-repetitive song which almost reaches 8 minutes long. The lyrics are clearly about Chuck's feeling towards the catholic church's doubtful manners. I can't stress enough how much I like the sound of this album. I think all death metal drummers should get a hint and listen to this album, and just realise you don't have to play at incredible speed to get a great song!\n\nGenetic Reconstruction starts with an awesome riff, which abruptly cuts, and goes into another great, yet surprising riff. Then comes the classic death harmonised melody. Chuck really had it back then! Again here, the solo, is EXCELLENT! The backing riff and drum beat merge perfectly together. I don't understand how they managed to come up with such great ideas. Nobody in death metal has ever come close to this in my opinion. No one.\n\nClosing the album is the fast Killing Spree, complimented by cool lyrics about a guy who is sick of his boring life, so he decides to put a little something new in his life by killing people, and enjoying it. The middle part is amazingly musical. Another great, great, GREAT solo! A perfect way to end the album, leaving the listener amazed and wanting to play the record all over again.\n\nIf you ever come across this album in a record store, may it be on vinyl, on cassette or on CD, buy it. It is absolutely worth it, and you won't ever let it go. it is the best work from Death, it is incredibly underrated and more people have to discover this great metal work. Do it for yourself, you'll be pleased.\n",
        "\nThis is Death's second full-length album, entitled \"Leprosy\". It was released by Century Media in 1988. \n\n\nWell, two things I noticed about this album that I didn't see on \"Sream Bloody Gore\" were that the drums and vocals are now louder than they were on the previous album. By now, I hate to say this, but the drums, to me, are getting very reptitive. Another thing I noticed, is that the bass is not very audible. You can hear it, but not as well as you'd like. But where this album triumphs is in it's vocal work and it's guitar.\n\n\nThe opening track, named for the album, \"Leprosy\", is like a straight-forward kick in the nuts (a good one, don't worry) that says, \"Hey, we're Death, and we kick some serious ass\". Whenever I hear that first riff, it makes me feel... like, powerful, like I just want to raise my fist in the air, and nod slowly with my eyes wide open. It's THAT kind of riff and guitar work that make this album so great. Though the drums are fairly simple, just fast, they make up for it by just being, well, good. Great beats, and good patterns. They are a little bit repetitive, in pattern, and the drums themselves. And, I have to compliment the vocals. They are superb. SUPERB. They are clean, audible, and not muffled or anyhing, no strings attached, just great, classic Death Metal vocals. It just... Kicks your ass.\n\n\nAs there are good things with this album, that means there are bad things. Well, not nessicarily bad, but things that could've been approved. A couple things I personally would have liked to see improved are 1) The bass. It's not bad, by any means, but it is not LOUD ENOUGH. 2) The repetitive drumming. I would liked to have seen a little more variety, and a little bit more than a bass and a snare, that's all. I have to say, the vocals make up for a lot of the little nit-pick problems witht he ablum. They are fantastic. Death, man, no body fucks with Death, so go buy this album!\n\n-Dolf (9/27/1986)\n",
        "\nScream Bloody Gore is the first album by one of the very first Death Metal bands EVER. Death. Death Metal. The Grandfathers. The God Fathers. the Makers, of Death Metal. Well, as the first album by Death that I had ever heard, I had no idea what to expect. I didn't know if it was going to be deep, screamy, low, gurgly, I didn't know if it was going to have terrible guitar tone, inaudible drums and bass, or disgusting production. Well, when I flipped the switch on this album, I could not believe my ears.\n\n\nThe first thing that you hear is possibly the most sinister intro I have ever heard, I speak of course, of the opener, \"Infernal Death\". Right away, when all the instruments kick in, you have to notice two things, 1) that the production is incredible. Out of all the classic Death Metal-ers, this has got to be top-fucking-notch, and 2) (Possibly my favorite part of the whole album) The bass is fucking amazing. It's the perfect volume, tone, and heaviness. It's audible! Even THAT is unexpected, let alone being so good you find yourself saying \"I need to hear that bass line\" instead of \"I have to listen to that guitar solo\". That's another thing right there too. The guitar solos! There are numerous guitar solos throughout the entire album. And no, not the cheap, crappy ones that beg for listening, like Lamb Of God's solos, but good quality, unique solos that you miss in Death Metal nowadays. Also, with this album you have a LOT of variety, there are slow starters that break into heinous drum beats and thick guitar leads. \"Zombie Ritual\" is the perfect example. There are songs that start off very melodic and graceful, and then just break you in half. Listen to \"Evil Dead\" for an example. What I'm basically trying to say is that the variety is key with this album. It's glaring. You'll find yourself listening to the whole album so many times, and never getting bored of it. It's the all-you-can-eat Death Metal album.\n\n\nOf course, with all the good things about an album, you have to pick out the problems, as that's what reviews are for. I'd have to say, that my only complaints are that the drums are turned down too much, and that the vocals are not loud enough. Nothing wrong with the music or vocals musically or vocally, just the fact that the drums and vocals are turned down a little bit too much. I gotta take off 5% for Vocals, and 5% for drums. Everything else about the album is amazing. Pick it up, it'll grow some hair on your balls.\n\n-Dolf (9/27/1986)\n",
        "\nWhile it may not have the dream lineup that Individual Thought Patterns had, this is still one of the most solid ensembles of musicians ever put together. The extremely capable duet of newcomers, Kelly Conlon (bass) and Bobby Koeble (guitar) put on quite a show on Symbolic, each with their share of stand out technical parts. The real heroes of this record though, are hands down the two gods of their instruments, The Atomic Clock... Gene Hoglan (drums) and the almighty mastermind behind Death.... Chuck Schuldiner (guitar, vocals).\n\nLet's get one thing out of the way early, Death has gone through many progressions as a band, and for some reason it is frowned upon (while bands like Running Wild get lambasted for never changing (and stranger yet, bands like Iron Maiden and The Lord Weird Slough Feg are praised for \"sticking to their guns\" (I love all three bands by the way))), maybe it is because they are one of the pioneers of Death metal, and to some, the first death metal band. So I guess as pioneers they aren't allowed to expand and instead need to stick with what they started lest they form a new band. Whatever, it's all a load of bullshit. My point is, this is during the later period of their career, so comparing it to Scream Bloody Gore or Leprosy is just absurd. Instead of the straight up thrashy death metal found on the first few releases, this is far more extreme progressive metal.\n\nThe production here is magnificent, every instrument is heard crystal clear, even the bass (a rarity for a metal record). Gene's drums just absolutely obliterate everything on high speed shredders like 1000 Eyes and the title track. Chuck's vocals are once again a bit higher than on the previous release, a trend that started with Human and continued throughout their discography. \n\nThe opening track begins with a slower, kind of grinding riff. You can just feel like something is going to explode on your face like Peter North's yogurt cannon does to the likes of Jenna Jameson, and oh boy does it deliver. When it kicks into full gear, I find myself headbanging and air guitaring every single time..... even when driving. This is a dangerous song for my iPod to randomly choose in the car. This particular track also features one of the most insane solos on the album. Easily one of the highlights... and it's only the beginning.\n\nNext up is Zero Tolerance, a noticeable step down from the shredding moshfest of the title track. I think my main reason for thinking this a weak point in the album is because it's too slow. Hey, I love Candlemass, so slow music isn't a problem, it's just that this piece is too pedestrian, and seems to just chug along without ever releasing it's potential like the last one did. Again, the solo is the highlight of this song, and really saves it a point or two.\n\nEmpty Words is a strange one, it's one of my favorites, but there is just something about it that I find bizarre. Maybe it's because you hear one of the melodies used in the opening track being used here.... it's clear there is no shortage of ideas, but there is no overt concept to the album, so it's strange that they reuse ideas. That doesn't stop this song from being just as awesome, if not MORE awesome than the Symbolic. Death really is a band that gets it right when they turn it up to eleven and play fast paced, at least Hoglan seems the most comfortable at those extreme speeds... and that's where he shines the most. Further examples to come....\n\nSacred Serenity keeps the weirdness up by using a very blatant melody found in the previous track! It uses it as the chorus this time, so it's almost impossible not to notice, but once again it doesn't detract from the song at all. This one showcases some of my favorite riffs on the whole album.\n\nBut then, the unholy trinity of the album arrives. The next string of songs rivals the first half of Litany or By Inheritance for the most amazing string of songs in a row. 1000 Eyes is really Gene's showcase for his insanely precise drumwork. Coupled with a catchy chorus, this song is just tailor made for destruction. For best results, crank at full volume around old people. Without Judgement brings up the second part of our blasphemous trilogy of metal. It starts off with one of the most perfect riffs in the sense that I just feel like moving every time I hear it. Be it air guitar, moshing, punching my nearest companion in swinging distance, I find it impossible to sit still. The buildup around 1:50 is nothing short of orgasmic, especially when the drums kick in.\n\nBringing up the rear of the trilogy, is one of the most masterful songs of the genre, and considered by some to be the standard by which this style is judged by. This song is Crystal Mountain. As I've said in other reviews, the best things in life need the least explaining. The acousticism and melodic distortion intertwine so well in the chorus, it's nuts... just trust me.\n\nMisanthrope is the first time the songwriting drops down a notch since the second track, and that isn't saying much, considering it is a great song. Finishing off the record is the 8 minute epic, Perennial Quest. This one is a fan favorite, but I actually find it to be a bit overlong. It has great riffs, some of the best on the record, but I don't think the song should've been as long as it was made. But that's just a personal gripe of mine.\n\nMy calculations make this album round up to a 96%, making it the highest rating I have given so far. Truly a testament to how great this record is. I suggest any music fan with a passing interest in metal that can at the very least tolerate screamed vocals give this album a shot. It was my gateway to Death, and it is a great album to start off with. If you like a more straightforward and raw sound, try their debut, Scream Bloody Gore. If you like really proggy death metal, try The Sound of Perseverance. If you are a big Atheist fan, try Individual Though Patterns. If a good mixture of all the elements of metal, listen to Symbolic. Really, Death can do no wrong.\n",
        "\nI am not a great fan of death metal. Having been fed on the melodic chops of bands like Purple, Dio and Maiden since birth, I will always tend towards the romantic (in the traditional sense) side of metal. It's in my genes.\n\nYet so is Mot\u00f6rhead, from whence the object of our consideration today is really descended. Oh, sure, one can make a case for Possessed or Slayer as the godfathers of death metal - though this record itself is a very, very primal form of it, much closer to thrash than, say, Nile or Cryptopsy - but at the end of the day it is always the runaway speedster ethos of Lemmy's hellraisers which underscores most of the death metal aesthetic. And for this reason I can embrace the Dadaist sympathies of the movement while decrying its gorier excesses.\n\nI also like to think that I recognize genius when I see it, and I've seen it in very few places as brightly as Mr. Chuck Schuldiner, rest his non-existent soul. One could wax poetic on the influence Chuck had on all metal after him, and, while I do tend to hold that Seven Churches is just as responsible for death metal as the band which lent its name to the genre, there is no denying that he nearly single-handedly crafted the main thematic elements which would serve hundreds of inferior bands well in the years to come.\n\nAnd nowhere is this more evident than on this release, Scream Bloody Gore. True, this is primitive, nearly tribal in its execution, but all the elements for gory and glory success are already present and a-fucking-counted for. From the opening riffage of the lead-off track \"Infernal Death\" to Chuck's first infernal bellow, one can already detect the sheer intensity behind this slab of meaty death. The first song breaks down almost immediately into a cacophony of excellent drumming as provided by Chris Reifert, but what really matters here are the meaty riffs --\n\nand oh, are there riffs! The first song alone tears up the ground while it plants you in it, hammering you with blow after skull-crushing blow, before descending into a whirlwind solo of the sort Kerry King can only fantasize about. And this all in the first track!\n\nTo be honest, I'm not particularly good at distinguishing between death metal songs. A riff here, a riff there - what's the difference? This is especially true of Schuldiner's Satanic spawn in the grindcore scene. But this record is different: ever riff here is quite distinct from every other, and we occasionally glimpse bits of melody, such as in the lead-up to \"Zombie Ritual\". There's not a lot of it, but it's here.\n\nThe truth of the matter that nothing here is particularly speedy, at least as far as today's metal goes; this is simple brutality, intended to do nothing more than hammer you down spiritually before reconstructing you with rage and saliva. And it works, particularly on \"Baptized in Blood\" and \"Evil Dead\", two of the best pure death metal cuts ever hacked out of the body of music. One can sense the fury with which Schuldinir delivers his opus, underscored to perfection by his throaty, visceral vocals.\n\nThis is not the best death metal album, unlike what some past reviewers have suggested. Yes, the lyrics are juvenile to the point of insipidity (although they're perfectly sensible in light of the death metal aesthetic, and are more discernible here than in some other death metal records). And, yes, Morbid Angel were always superior to Schuldiner's best efforts. Nevertheless, Scream Bloody Gore is vital to the movement and to metal in general, and it's accessible(!) enough that even the novice death metalhead shouldn't be scared off by the raw symphony of hate portrayed here.\n\nIf political correctness, feminism, or traditional American values are your thing, stay clear. If, however, you have other philosophical sympathies, then explore...\n",
        "\nWell.. I'm ashamed to say, this is actually the first full Death album I have ever heard. Sure, I've heard bits and pieces from their early career, but I disregarded it without paying my full attention. Believe me now, I am slapping myself. Death manages to capture every aspect of death metal that I enjoy; technicality, brutality and decent lyrics (something I believe many death metal bands overlook).\n\nFrom the beginning riff of 'Flattering Emotions' to the closing outro to 'Vacant Planets' this album is nothing short of a masterpiece. Chuck's guitar work is spectacular through out, but are especially breath-taking during 'Vacant Planets' & 'Cosmic Sea'\n\nThe vocals remind me a lot of John Tardy (Obituary) but are easier to understand and sharper in my opinion. This kind of vocal style is far from idealistic for me, but still very enjoyable and fits in well with the kind of music that Death play.\n\nThe drums and bass are slightly less memorable, possibly due to the listeners attention constantly being directed at Chuck's nifty guitar work. There are a few exceptions however, including the brief bass fill at around 2:45 in 'Cosmic Sea' before Chuck's solo. I also particuarly enjoyed the drum work in the opening song, 'Flattering of Emotions'. On the whole however, the drumming is tight and fast and the bass guitar work seems fine.\n\nAs far as production goes, I only have one very small bone to pick. Personally I would have liked to have heard the bass a little higher in the mix.\n\nIt's pretty hard to sum this album up using words, because I honestly feel that some of it can only be explained by listening to it. I put off listening to Death for so many years and in some ways I regret it when I think of how many hours I could have spent headbanging along. But to be completely honest, if I had heard this before anything else, it would have totally destroyed my first impressions of almost every other death metal band out there. Definately a must have in your CD collection!\n\nStandout Tracks: 'Flattering of Emotions', 'Suicide Machine', 'See Through Dreams', 'Cosmic Sea', 'Vacant Planets' are my favourites, but the entire album is fantastic.\n",
        "\nWell, here we have an early live recording of the band Death, around the time they started using that now widely known moniker in place of the old name Mantas. First off, the sound quality of this recording is extremely good given this is both a live recording and that this recording is over two decades old. The guitars and drums are fairly simple to make out, as are the vocals. A lot of the songs here are a good bit thrashier than anything you'll hear on Death's first album, probably due to the band's Venom worship. Aside from the Venom cover, just look at the track \"Mantas\" to see the influence. It's got riffs that sound like they were pulled straight out of \"Welcome To Hell\", has a blistering pentatonic solo (Much in the style of Venom's lead guitarist, Mantas), and hell, it's named after one of Venom's members! \n\nAs the notes say, Chuck does some of the vocals, trading on and off with Kam Lee. Kam's vocals are fairly rough growls, deep, but not quite death metal vocals. Chuck, when he does sing, seems to do a Cronos-esque yell (Though less guttural than Cronos), or some of the high-pitched screams one would hear on Scream Bloody Gore. There is a bit of humour to be found in the transitions between songs, when one hears the members of Death (Talking in their growling voices and staying in some \"Evil\" character) introducing songs. In the beginning of \"Power of Darkness\", you can hear Chuck say, \"Death is on our side!\" with Kam joining in with \"When the darkness falls! Evil shall prevail! No light shown...Because...The powers of darkness!\". This may read as intimidating, but with Kam's voice, it's nothing short of hilarious to me. On to the guitars, the players (Rozz and Schuldiner, I presume) are quite good when one considers their lack of experience on instruments, with only the solo sections seeming off in any way. Granted, the guitar parts don't sound particularly hard, however, the simplicity of them adds to their overall impact, with no pretension of complexity. The drums are alright, powerful and thudding along with the guitar riffs in a similarly simplistic manner. This demo is really valuable more as a collector\u2019s item for rabid fans of Death rather than a must-buy, but I won't say it's worthless in regard to musical quality either\n",
        "\nThis is it. The highlight of Death's discography, their magnum opus, and one of the most incredible and beautiful albums ever released within the entire metal genre. With Symbolic, Chuck reached new heights, both as a songwriter, and as a musician. And if one dares call himself a fan of death metal, there is absolutely no excuse not have given every song featured here at least a few listens, and truth be told, this is a must own. There is nothing out there quite like Symbolic, and there never will be. Death and Chuck may be buried and gone, but with music like this, their legacy will continue to live on.\n\nThe history of Death has been well covered, so I won't go into terribly great detail. Basically, the short story is, that with Death's debut, Scream Bloody Gore, death metal was established(whether or not Death are the true creators of death metal is debatable, but what isn't up for debate is that SBG was instrumental in helping to create the genre altogether). From there, Death would release a few more classic albums that were straight up death metal, and then Chuck grew bored with the gore theme. Seeking to explore more philosophical ideas in the lyrics, as well as a more progressive sound(which was still death metal in itself, mind you) Chuck got a new lineup together and released 1991's Human. After that, a slight step down came two years later in Individual Thought Patters. So Andy LaRocque(guitar) and Steve DiGiorgio(bass) were ousted in favor of Bobby Koelble and Kelly Conion, respectively. And those two, along with founder evil Chuck and Gene Hoglan teamed up and created this, Symbolic. Initially intended to be Death's final album, they could not have gone out any better. This is perfection.\n\nI suppose with all this raving I should actually take a look into the actual music, eh? Well, the album starts with the title track, \"Symbolic\".This is a classic by any means, which begins with a crushing riff that speeds up for awhile, and then slows back down to the tune of Chuck shouting \"Symbolic past! So vivid! Yet at the same time, were invisible!\". Then at about three minutes in Chuck turns things into supersonic speed, leading to a very technical and awesome solo. The song then slows down again, and repeats into the pattern that it began with. This is easily one of Death's best, most well-written songs, but to call it the highlight of the album and stop there would be foolish. \"Without Judgement\" is another instant classic, with numerous time changes, including a straight up groovy breakdown about halfway through that soon explodes on your face as the song nears its conclusion. Other notable cuts featured(well, ALL the songs are notable) are Crystal Mountain and Perennial Quest, both vastly different but similar in the incorporation of an accoustic guitar near the completion of the track, which adds so much to the overral atmosphere, especially in Perennial Quest's case. Crystal Mountain, so much has been said about it individually that I'll just say the lyrics leave you thinking, and the song sticks in your head well after it's over. \n\nAs I listened to the acoustic guitar strumming way at the end of Perennial Quest after my first listen, it struck me. Here was a perfect album. I could pull out any track here to argue that metal could indeed be beautiful, not just mindless screaming with noise as the common opinion dictates. And I'm sure others have been struck that way, and when an album gets that kind of response out of you, there is nothing to do then to give it a 100%\n",
        "\nAfter a short but very important ( for death metal ) period with the band Mantas, Chuck \u201cEvil\u201d Schuldiner formed a new band. The name is a symbol of the music created by his guitar and the band: Death. After having released few demos that captured the attention of lots of fans in the underground, they finally released the first album, Scream Bloody Gore. This is the first step of a legend. \nThe violence in this album has made history\u2026each and every song is a classic, never forgotten by those who love true death metal. \n\nIn that period the most famous extreme metal band was surely Possessed, and \u201cEvil\u201d Chuck said more than once that his way of screaming was heavily influenced by Becerra. So Chuck decided to answer musically to that great band, playing something that was surely extreme, but also new. Let me explain: while Possessed inspired a lot of black metal bands for their look and their lyrics, Death can be considered the creators of death/gore metal. Their lyrics are something brutal, about splatters, zombies, mutilations. Horror themes are essential for Chuck in this period and the music is directly influenced by those visions of blood, gore and death.\n\nThe cover shows four skeleton priests drinking probably blood in the chalices, while behind them grows a bunch of bones. Musically, this album is still heavily influenced by brutal thrash metal of that period, but the violence here is brought to another level, a higher one. Chuck's screams are unique and from now on they are a trademark of this band. His way of screaming is so sick that in the beginning of Land Of No Return song is just incredible. Every song is quite simple, musically, but extremely \u201ccatchy\u201d thanks to brutally screamed refrains. \n\nEvery song in my humble opinion is a classic of death metal. DEATH METAL. No fucking influences in this album\u2026here Death are yet \u201cpure\u201d and distant from technical parts, almost progressive that they would have experimented in the near future. These songs are usually quite short and the speed is always high, except for the beginning of few ones. \u201cInfernal Death\u201d is a good example of that: in the beginning is slow and rotten with Chuck that screams DIEEE!!! After the holocaust is unleashed with fast guitars solos, drums-train and evil atmosphere.\n\nThe intros to \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d and \u201cEvil Death\u201d (here we can see the influence of horror movies in death metal) are something fantastic\u2026the guitars draw a landscape of eternal horror. AWESOME.\nUsually refrains are perfectly fixed in the guitars patterns to create a badass melody, something you can remember and scream any time you want\u2026the riffs are fast and brutal and the one in \u201cDenial Of Life\u201d is incredible. \u201cSacrificial Death\u201d alternates fast parts to slow ones in pure decomposition atmosphere, that surely inspired Obituary's song structure. The beginning to \u201cBaptized In Blood\u201d is awesome with a great scream, while the song contains one of the fastest parts in the album.\n\u201cTorn To Pieces\u201d is still very influenced by thrash metal in the slow parts and with \u201cBeyond The Unholy Grave\u201d it's like listening to Slayer\u2019s Show No Mercy on speed\u2026I could keep on describing a lot of things about this death masterpiece, but I can\u2019t. Folks, if you want brutality and history of a genre all together, take this album and they will bring you to the land of no return.\n",
        "\nThe crowning jewel in the discography of one of death metal's greatest and most influential bands, Symbolic is a necessary part of any metal collection. Its near-perfect combination of technicality, intelligence, and brutal energy affords the listener an experience unsurpased by any Death album, past or future. Chuck Schuldiner shows his musical genius on this album, both lyrically and in composition. What makes Death so amazing, though, is that the band leader and only founding member to remain, is not the sole talent to be found. Though the replacement of Steve DiGiorgio was unfortunate, Kelly Conlon is more than a sufficient bass player, and Bobby Koelble matches Chuck in skill on guitar. Meanwhile, Gene Hoglan once again produces fantastic drumming, completing a superb line-up for Symbolic. \n\nThe album begins with the 6-minute title-track, which immediately illustrates what is to come. Numerous solos captivate interest, and Chuck's voice rings out in his high combination shriek-growl. His unique style of singing flows perfectly with the music, and captures the spirit of his intelligent, spiritually-based lyrics which are so varied from the typical gore lyrics found in death metal. The second track, \"Zero Tolerance\" progresses to a new level, with a slower tempo, pounding bass, and several mind-blowing solos which combine fantastic lead and rhythm guitar in harmony. This is undoubtedly one of the best tracks on the album, and has become a fan-favorite. Each song follows in this path, with different individual strengths. \"Empty Words\", for example, is rather instrumentally simplistic, but has some of the album's best lyrics. \"Sacred Serenity\" and \"Without Judgement\" could be called Symbolic's filler songs, though they are both worth-while listens. In between these two lies the powerful \"1,000 Eyes\", and afterward is what is undoubtedly one of Death's masterpieces, \"Crystal Mountain\". The progressive elements are illustrated here, with numerous tempo changes, technical guitar riffs, and a catchy head-banging chorus. \"Misanthrope\" falls short after such a masterwork, but still holds its own as a unique, yet rather forgetable, follow-up to \"Crystal Mountain\". The final track, \"Perennial Quest\", concludes the album perfectly. An 8-minute epic, this song demands attention throughout, and leaves the listener with a sense of fufillment and peace. How often does one get that feeling from death metal?\n\nIn this album, Chuck Schuldiner combines every element necessary to make strong, memorable metal. It is a unique album that stands alone, and is worthy of anyone interested in death, progressive, or simply great metal.\n",
        "\nPerfection, complete perfection. These were the first thoughts that ran through my head upon the first listen of this album. \"Symbolic\" is Death's sixth studio album. The band had begun in progressing their sound a few albums back on \"Human\" but nothing at all to this extent. If you will excuse the pun, Chuck chucked out most of the death metal sound on this album and chucked in a whole bunch of progressive influence which really makes this Death's most unique album (behind The Sound of Perseverance).\n\nChuck's vocals are different on this one, I would have a hard time classifying them as standard death metal vocals but they sure are harsh and raw. I really wish these kinds of vocals are used more often in metal as they are full of power and emotion. The guitar playing is absolute genius, the opening riff of \"Symbolic\" has to be one of my favourite riffs ever. The slow, brooding riff turns into some fast paced action and then into one of the craziest solo's that Death have ever written. That kind of guitar work makes the album great. \n\nAnother thing that Death have incorporated into \"Symbolic\" are softer section in songs. Such songs as \"Crystal Mountain\" and \"Perennial Quest\" have acoustic guitars, but by no means are these songs lacking any balls. In fact, I think it was quite gutsy for Chuck to add in these section as they really are different to anything Death had done up to that point.\n\nLyrically, \"Symbolic\" is Death's finest hour. Such songs as \"Perennial Quest\" and \"Without Judgment\" are highly philosophical. I'm really glad that Chuck ditched the old horror and gore thing many albums ago in favour of these lyrics.\n\nThe rest of the band, Kelly Conlon (bass), Bobby Koelble (guitar) and Gene Hoglan (drums) are often forgotten. Although Chuck shine on this album Conlon and Hoglan are the backbone. Hoglans' drums in every song are so powerfull and full of raw emotion, he truly is one of the greatest drummers in metal. As far as Death bassists go, Kelly Conlon is not the best (that hight distinction must go to Steve DiGiorgio) but that doesn't mean he is bad. He shines the most on \"Sacred Serenity\" but apart from that the bass can be forgettable Bobby Koelble does a really decent job as Death's second guiatarist. Although Chuck does indeed to the better guitar riffs and solos on the album, Koelble does have some interesting parts.\n\nThis is easily the most Accessible although it is far from commercial. Anyone who is a fan of the great Chuck Schuldiner should get this album. There is something for everyone in this album, harsh vocals, incredible guitar melodies and pounding drums so the listener should easily fall in love with this album just the way I did.\n",
        "\nI'm a big fan of Death, believe me. I think \"Symbolic\" is one of the best American metal albums of all time (because we all know Americans can't make metal decently), and Chuck's incredible solos and overall technical ability are well-known even beyond death metal. He prefers melody and emotion over speed, which is VERY rare in the metal world. The saga of this immensely influential band began in '87 with their release of \"Scream Bloody Gore\", which is generally regarded as one of the first albums of its genre.\n\nSo, let's start screaming the bloody gory album. First track is \"Infernal Death\". The slow-paced, doomy intro is pretty interesting and Schuldiner's throaty chanting is also thrilling. But, sadly enough, after 40 seconds the track gets just retarded - both musically and lyrically. Chris Reifert's bombastic drumming is quite numb, he doesn't seem to know how to change that one and only pattern...every one of you knows how Dave Lombardo changes between jackhammer beats and groovy slicks fluently in Reign In Blood, right? No sign of that here. What's more, the snare drum sounds like water dropping on the cooker. DEATH METAL COOKING, I tell ya! Sad you couldn't get Gene on this one, Chuck.\n\n\"Zombie Ritual\" begins with a very Middle-Eastern-style riff, already showing signs what Chuck is capable of in songwriting. Well, another 15 seconds and were looking at another piece of wasted potential. Without the nice intro, I'd still think it's \"Infernal Death\" going on, and intros alone don't make a good song.\n\n\"Denial Of Life\" is boring from start to finish, as is \"Sacrificial\". The best riffing on this album is without doubt on \"Mutilation\", and \"Regurgitated Guts\" shows us that Chris finally uses some imagination in his drumming. \"Baptized In Blood\" is also structured very well and doesn't fall apart like the first four songs sadly do. Then we have \"Torn To Pieces\", which reminds me either from Infernal Death or Denial Of Life, or both of them, I don't even care because this track just sucks. Evil Dead is much better. It begins with a very nice, melodic intro and also includes the best solo on the album. \"Scream Bloody Gore\" acts as a decent closer to the album, and eases the pain caused by this (most of the time) horrible listening experience, because you'll know that it's finally going to end. I'd say the best tracks on this album are the live bonus tracks from album \"Leprosy\" on the re-release, but if we'll stick to the original one, Evil Dead is the winner.\n\nSchuldiner's guttural screams are as good as ever, though. I'm sure most of the teenage fanboys of Bon Jovi shitted their pants back in the day after hearing this: just listen the sick, twisted scream at the beginning of \"Baptized In Blood\". The lyrics, quite frankly, are idiotic. Chris Barnes must've had a twenty-hour-long erection after reading those geezy lines on \"Sacrificial\":\n\n\"Sacrificial cunt\nI despise\nsacrificial cunt\nno more lies\"\n\nReally, why say anything else? No more lies, that is. The lyrics on the whole album are so stupid it's hard to believe they're written by someone with English as his primary language (or someone older than 5). If I want \"spooky\" death metal, then I'll go for some Morbid Angel. If I want something more varied and progressive, then I'll go for Atheist, Nocturnus or - better still - the awesome Scandinavian death bands (Entombed excluded). This is nothing but a waste of time. The production is decent, although it could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been much heavier too. For those who like to hear bass lines loud and clear, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably enjoy the sonic impact of this (although the bass lines are quite bland to say the least). Most of the time it actually seems that the drums and bass drown out the guitars completely, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re almost dead up in the middle.\n\nOne of my friends said I would have a different outlook on this release if it was the first album from this Florida band, well IT IS! This was actually one of my very first \"true\" metal albums I bought when I was around 10 or 11, and man do I still get goose bumps when listening to those classics that changed my musical taste forever (Ahh, La Masquerade Infernale!) - or, at least, most of them. For this, I grew out of this after ten listens, maybe - and the last remains of any impressive moments on this album (if there were any at all) have gotten weaker ever since. Yeah, maybe it was brutal for my pre-teenage ears, and to those who lived to witness this back in '87, but I know much better albums from that era which are much faster, heavier and better executed (Schizophrenia anyone?). Hell, even Seven Churches (the TRUE genre template) is more listenable than this, and it came out two years before this. This album has done nothing to the genre but spawned millions of uber-retarded bands like Entombed and Deicide (or, worse still, Reifert's future band Autopsy. Uuurgh!). \"Altars Of Madness\" beats this one 15-0 on the first half of the game, seriously.\n\nLet's sum up the pros and cons:\n\n+ Chuck's vocals (although not as impressive as on later releases)\n+ Songs \"Mutilation\", \"Baptized In Blood\" and \"Evil Dead\" are above average\n\n- Lyrics (I can't stress this hard enough)\n- Production\n- Considerable lack of imagination in songwriting\n- Drums\n\nOnce in a while, I actually find this one from my CD player, wondering how the hell it made there in the first place. For all means, buy \"Human\" and any album that came after that, I'd suggest to start with Symbolic.\n",
        "\nIntroducing both Schuldiner as well as Reifert to the world makes 'Scream Bloody Gore' an important release already. The fact that Reifert left shortly after and his performance here is actually one of the sloppiest ones in his career, doesn't change that. Yes, a bit sloppy at times but his enthousiasm and energy really make up for it. Now mr Schuldiner himself was still in his fase of perfecting his style and skills and once again youthful enthusiasm does half the work here. Most riffs aren\u2019t all too technical but some are catchy as hell and that's what counts. \n\nOn to the music. As said there are plenty of flaws to be found in the performance. The intensity however prevails. \u2018Scream Bloody Gore\u2019 offers some mighty powerful songs, filthy and brutal death metal, almost avant la lettre. 'Evil Dead' is by far the best song present (the oldiest song I later came to realise) and has a great eerie melodic intro before plunging into a really fast catchy tune with nothing less than some of the best riffs on the album. Another song containing some of the best riffs and breaks on the album is the titletrack, which was the newest song and already has a \u2018Leprosy\u2019-edge to it. \n\nOther classics include the uptempo 'Mutilation' (great opening riff, superb chorus), \u2018Zombie Ritual\u2019 (melodic intro, uptempo thrasher, great midpaced chorus) and \u2018Baptized in Blood\u2019 (changes pace a lot, second best chorus on the album). Also worth mentioning are \u2018Denial Of Life\u2019 which has a great chorus that has been stuck in my mind since I first heard it and \u2018Torn to Pieces\u2019 with its grooving verses followed by a speedy chorus and a great solo. After years of playing the vinyl I was glad I bought the CD version because it had to two extra tracks from which \u2018Beyond the Unholy Grave\u2019 instantly became one of my favorites. After a great opening riff the song erupts into brutal death metal thrashing. After a catchy midpaced bridge a really superb chorus is the finishing touch to an already classic song.\n\nYes, of course a few classic demosongs were not included on the album. I had rather seen \u2018Archangel\u2019 instead of \u2018Sacrifical\u2019 for instance. For that matter, Death has really got an album full of unreleased songs from their demoperiod and I agree that some songs on \u2018Scream Bloody Gore\u2019 could have been replaced by better material. As said \u2018Sacrificial\u2019 is one of the weaker track. The doomy intro riff is rather lame and the chorus is quite weak compared to the rest of the songs. Second song to be one of the weaker ones is \u2018Regurgitated Guts\u2019. The main riff of the verses is pretty dull and the chorus can hardly be called a decent chorus at all. The middle section of the song increases pace after 2:41 minutes in a good way and the solo is quite good but both aren\u2019t enough to save the song.\n\nBy the way, Does anyone know what else John Hand has done musically besides appreaing on this album cover?\n",
        "\nJust two years after releasing probably their best album from their career with the best line-up, it was of course rather predictable that the next album could not live up to expectations. The quality of musicianship however was still here but on a different level and mr Schuldiner did present us some very impressive new riffs and melodies on \u2018Individual Thought Patterns\u2019.\n\nThe start of \u2018Overactive imagination\u2019 was impressive but the rhythmical midpaced verses do the composition some damage. Same goes for the unimpressive chorus. The solo of lead guitarist Andy LaRocque however is quite good and melodic and really has that King Diamond feeling. In the end it also turned out to be LaRoques best solo on the album.\n\nThe rhythmical experimentation continues on \u2018In Human Form\u2019 and the song never really leaves the ground to take a flight to immortality. \u2018Jealousy\u2019 does a slightly better job at that. Again rhythmical verses but this time saved by impressive riffing. The slowed down section with the fretless bass-slide however is pretty horridly jazzy. The song is saved by the uptempo chorus that has a mighty main riff. The moshing part after the chorus had some good work DiGiorgio on bass. \u2018Trapped in a Corner\u2019 has the same flaws as \u2018In Human Form\u2019, being those rhythmical verses that are getting annoying by now. \u2018Nothing is Everything\u2019 uses the same trick as 'Jealousy', namely having an impressive chorus that saves the song. This time the chorus doesn\u2019t have a riff but a beautiful twin harmony. Nice touch! \n\n\u2018Mentally Blind\u2019 finally has a normal verse with midpaced drums that don\u2019t demand all the attention. The bridge is sped up and the slowpaced chorus has a nice guitar melody and vocal line following each other. The middle section of the song is pretty amazing, building up to a midpaced double bass climax on with all musicians excel in tightness. The title track 'Individual Thought Pattern' has a nice uptempo syncopated verse but the rest of the song shares the same flaws with \u2018In Human Form\u2019 and \u2018Trapped in a Corner\u2019. Now \u2018Destiny\u2019 starts rather nicely with a clean intro and solo. The following break could have come straight from \u2018Spiritual Healing\u2019 and the verse sustains this heaviness. The half assed melodic bridge and rhythmical chorus however are extremely poor and quite ruin the song. \n\n\u2018Out Of Touch\u2019 has more straightforward verses and therefore becomes a pretty decent track at times with some nice uptempo touches and this time the rhythms and eerie riffing on the chorus work out nicely. The long middle section however does the song some damage and the twin harmonic riff leading to the solo is rather dull for Schuldiner standards. The immediate classic \u2018The Philosopher\u2019 was a blend of the \u2018Spiritual Healing\u2019 and \u2018Human\u2019 styles and remains one of Schuldiners strongest slowpaced compositions ever. \n\nThe album had an overdose of rhythmical verses that made the album sound rather formulaic. Also the standard \u2018verse, chorus, middle section, verse, chorus\u2019 structure was getting annoyingly predictable by now. The faster parts of the album are the best since they contain some real power and most of the best riffs and melodies on the album. The production was a step back from \u2018Human\u2019 being less heavy and having a slightly less enjoyable crunchy guitar sound. \n\nWhy Gene Hoglan made such a mess of it is hard to say. Possibly he wanted to do something else than in his later Dark Angel years. But this was too much of a change all of a sudden. He could and should have given the album much more speed and power. Instead he was experimenting too much for his own ego. I am really a Dark Angel fan but after hearing \u2018Individual Thought Pattern\u2019 I was screaming for Sean Reinert. And, however good mr Laroque is, I also missed Masvidal with his heavy sound and solos for they suited Death so much more.\n",
        "\nYes, a highlight in their career! For one, Schuldiner finally got rid off his worst rhythmsection ever and chose what afterwards can be considered his best, namely Cynic drummer Sean Reiniert and the fretless bandwhore Steve DiGiorgio on bass. On top of things he also got guitarist Paul Masvidal (Cynic as well) which was a improvement to James Murphy (and that is saying something).\n\nSecondly the songwriting skills had improved in terms of writing shorter more logical songs with a clear structure and recognisable chorus. \u2018Flattening Of Emotions\u2019 and \u2018Lack Of Comprehension\u2019 really stand out here. These are some finetuned compositions which were so transparent of structure that there was plenty of room for the individual instrumentalist to excell within the boundaries. \u2018Suicide Machine\u2019, \u2018Together As One\u2019, \u2018See Through Dreams\u2019, \u2018Vacant Planets\u2019\u2019 and \u2018Secret Face\u2019 are all catchy powerful death metal songs of high quality diversity and dynamics that equal the best songs from their previous record. \n\nThe production matched (topped actually) the heaviness of \u2018Leprosy with the definition and tranparency of \u2018Spiritual Healing\u2019 resulting in the perfect hybrid. The sound is simply amazing and suitable.\n\nThere are however two things for me to complain about. Mostly it\u2019s the instrumental song \u2018Cosmic Sea\u2019 which I still find to be rather dull. Even the allegedly impressive solo doesn\u2019t \u2018do it\u2019 for me. The last complaint is the length of the album. Too short.\n",
        "\nA slight improvement compared to Leprosy but not enough. The two worst elements (rhythm section) from Leprosy were still present. The drums were still too simple for the compositions and the clear production \u2018Spiritual Healing\u2019 had, made this even more obvious. I don\u2019t know if Terry Butler really played the bassguitar this time but who cares, they\u2019re hardly hearable.\n\nRick Rozz was replaced by a guy named James Murphy who was still skinny and unknown in 1990 and would later also make name for himself with Obituary, Cancer and Testament and some others as well. Murphys solos are a huge improvement as they could compete with Schuldiner with ease, making the interaction worthwhile to listen to. A great example is the superb solo work on \u2018Altering the Future\u2019.\n\nApart from the titletrack this album has not brought forth as many classic as other albums yet it holds some great material. \u2018Genetic Reconstruction\u2019 and \u2018Defensive Personalities\u2019 both share a decent blend of midpaced and uptempo thrashing death metal with a high level of catchiness and some great lyrics that go beyond the good old gore approach. These two are easily the best songs on the album together with the already mentioned titletrack and opener \u2018Living Monstrocity\u2019. The opinions about the lyrics of his anti-abortion song \u2018Altering the Future\u2019 are divided and I myself do not share his point of view. The song itself is musically great although at times slow paced a bit too much.\n\n\u2018Spiritual Healing\u2019 was a tiny step forward compared to \u2018Leprosy\u2019 concerning compositional quality and a fairly large step sideways in terms of leaving the gore lyrics and heavy production behind.\n",
        "\nThe album holds two classic songs, three goods tracks, two adequate ones and one obsolete filler. Furthermore the album holds one briliant musician, one fairly good musician and 2 very mediocre ones.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s elaborate. \u2018Leprosy\u2019 and \u2018Pull the Plug\u2019 are the best two songs here. Lots of fluent changes in pace, good dynamics, interesting structures an catchiness. The threesome \u2018Born Dead\u2019, \u2018Forgotten Past\u2019 and \u2018Left To Die\u2019 all follow the exact same path (being verse, chorus, middle section including bridge and solo, verse and chorus again) Therefor becoming somewhat compositionally generic. Though the majority of riffs, the chorus of \u2018Forgotten Past\u2019 and the solo of \u2018Born Dead\u2019 are really great. \u2018Open Casket\u2019 and \u2019Choke on It\u2019 are the two adequate songs here that aren\u2019t great nor bad. Worst part of the album by far is \u2018Primitive Ways\u2019 which is a dull and uninspired composition.\n\nThe briliant musician here is Schuldiner himself, having written the bulk of the album including the classics and delivering his parts and vocals with filthiness as well as tightness. Rick Rozz is the fairly good one, doing a great job at rhythm guitar but is far from a suitable Death lead guitarist considering his Slayer impressions presented here. Not much can be said about Terry Butler except that he didn\u2019t play a single note on the album. Also Bill Andrews isn\u2019t someone to be happy about. He\u2019s decent in the midtempo section but uptempo he resorts to the same old polka beat over and over without any nuances or bassdrum accents. The production of his snaredrum didn\u2019t do his style any good either.\n\nStill 5 good and excellent songs present here to make it worth having \u2018Leprosy\u2019.\n",
        "\nVery few bands have albums that will live on far past their time. Led Zeppelin has it. Metallica has it. And with the release of this album, Death achieved it. Not only a landmark album in Death Metal, but this is Death's best album. \"Human\" takes the whole Death Metal genre to new heights. The album is musically advanced and lyrically complex.\n\nSome history of the band up to this point: Death, coming off their poorly critical acclaimed album \"Spiritual Healing\", begins with a fresh slate. Maestro Chuck Schuldiner recruits a new line-up consisting of bass extraordinaire Steve DiGiorgio and Cynic band mates Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal. Schuldiner was growing angry by the inconsistency of band members and opted to use studio and touring musicians. \n\n\"Human\" is musically their best attempt at newfound complexity. Up until this album, their music hadn't been nearly this complex. Each song can be defined with guitars consisting of fast riffing accompanied by complex fills and odd time signatures, bass playing technically complex and out of this world, and drums that blast hard and complement the music to make it well rounded and complete. Early traces of the melody that would be very present in their later albums can be found in songs such as \"Lack of Comprehension\" and \"Cosmic Sea\" while still keeping the fast and aggressive pace that was present in their first albums in songs such as \"Flattening of Emotions\" and \"Suicide Machine\". Their best example of new found musically advanced complexity can be found in the song \"Secret Face\". \n\nThe landmark record is also a subject to new lyrical themes. Abandoning the gore and death themes of their early albums, \"Human\" shows the lyrical evolution into reality. Songs such as \"Lack of Comprehension\" and \"Flattening of Emotions\" are prime examples of the lyrical adventures exploring into new territory.\n\nThis record opened many doors in the Death Metal genre, allowing new skills and abilities to be brought to the table. It created a new dimension for Death Metal. \"Human\" will love long past its years and has proved to not only be a technical death metal essential, but a metal essential as a whole. Some interesting facts are that this is the first Death album that Ed Repka (most known as being the creator of the Megadeth mascot \"Vic\") didn't create the cover for.\n\nNothing is perfect though, this album does contain errors. The album losses points in its biggest error which is in the field of production. The guitar leads and rhythms sound awesome, but you have to look into the less than stellar production to find the awesome bass of DiGiorgio. After one or two listens, you will be able to tell the instruments apart and production isn't a very big issue anymore. But it's a shame that this album couldn't enjoy the production of later albums like Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance. However, given the time period, excellent production wasn't as easily accessible. \n\nFavorite Track: Flattening of Emotions\nLeast Favorite Track: none. Seriously, this album doesn't contain a track that is less than a 10/10. I suppose if I had to pick one, it would be Vacant Planets because it's the shortest. But that doesn't say a lot.\n",
        "\n\"Scream Bloody Gore\" is the album the purists always worship at the altar of, but why not this one as well? While it is nowhere near as musically advanced as the direction Chuck went into a couple of albums later, beginning with \"Human\", it still is worthy of notice. Make that very worthy of notice--this album, flaws aside, still kills most everything in its path with its primitive intensity and vigorous attack. \n\nDan Johnson's production is excellent, and showcases a good mix where all players are heard well and clearly with plenty of depth and warmth as well. The guitars sound fantastic, both lead and rhythm tones, and you can even hear the bass pretty well, not that it does anything spectacular, but it serves its purpose by making the guitars sound even heavier. I will take this over the Scott Burns \"mush tone drone\" that became the trademark of death metal for several years, it makes the band sound that much more professional and powerful, for my ears. \n\nSpeaking of professional, the band is nice and tight on this release, with the occasional screwup on Bill Andrews' part only slightly detracting from the overall performance. Well, OK, I did mention there were flaws here; Andrews is far from a terribly skilled drummer, and Rick Rozz is the most hilariously incompetent excuse for a lead guitarist I've ever heard, bar none. His horsey noises and squeals get tiresome after a couple songs' worth. But Chuck really started showing signs of becoming a far better writer and player even at this early juncture, with fluid and passionate leads that hinted at the level of melodic virtuosity he'd soon achieve. I'm glad he ditched this sorry lot of morons in favor of the more advanced players he'd soon feature on future albums.\n\nSong wise, virtually every tune on this album features crushing riffs, devastating vocals (\"vokills\" is a very appropriate term on this album), and a nefarious atmosphere that is menacing and evil at any tempo. The title track, \"Pull The Plug\", and \"Forgotten Past\" really stand out the most to these lugholes, though, as they even have memorable choruses! The leads following the first chorus on \"Leprosy\" are particularly excellent, too. \"Born Dead\" is pretty standard issue, but still kills anything fool enough to stumble into its path.\n\nReally, this is an important album both for Death and for Chuck Schuldiner, as well as for death metal as it grew into the evil monster it eventually became. It was a watershed in that it showed Chuck at a crossroads where he was faced with the option of becoming a better player and writer or staying the same, and the fact that on this album he'd already made massive strides in both those realms is evidence as to what path he chose. It's a good thing he did, too, as metal in general benefited from this happening. Definitely get this one, for sure, so you can see the roots of where death metal really started kicking it up a few factors, if you're young and need to be educated properly as to what's good and what's not. This is GOOD.\n",
        "\nUtterly pummeling. Subtely technical and simply brutal. Pure agression, anger and beauty perfectly balanced in a precise unleashment of hatres towards society. Death's \"Human\" is one of the several albums that all death metal is measured against. It is a genre milestone, a glimpse into the future of death metal. It is the perfect blend of all that was death metal at the time - groove, brutality, and the imminent infusion of jazz elements with the genre's past thrash roots. It is an album that is as relevant today as when it came out almost sixteen years ago. For me, it is hard to be unbaised toward the album that indroduced my once ignorant ears to death metal.\n\nThousands of words have been used to describe this album. Thousands of hours have been sprent listening to \"Human\" by fans all across the world. These fans have been drawn into the deep production, master songmanship, incredible musicianship and personality of each song. Listening to Human is an experience. Blasting songs like \"Suicide Machine\" and \"Lack of Comprehension\" is almost a spiritual awakening for many. The sheer impact of the music hitting you is enough to make you stop an allow the songs to absorb you and your attention. I once played \"Lack of Comprehension\" in a school class for a presentation and everyone simply sat and stared for three minutes, completely shocked. To them it was an eternity, for me, it was over too quickly.\n\nAs the drums fade into \"Flattening of Emotions,\" you are completely unprepared for the sonic intensity of the guitar tone. I still get chills racing up and down m spine when that song erupts. It's like an orgasm of death metal fury - so powerful and close. One of the most powerful aspects of the album's tone is its depth. The guitars sound as if there are a million guitars playing simultaneously and hitting every note at the same time. Sadly, the bass is generally lacking and even the intro to \"Lack of Comprehension,\" is a bit hard to decipher without close examination. Schuldiner's guitar tone is simply overpowering the bass. DiGiorgio should have been a bit more audible in the mix. Luckily the guitar tone that Chuck and Paul Masvidal discovered for this album is simply incredible. The tone is beautiful and fucking HEAVY. It is absolutely uncompromising.\n\nThis production supports one of the strongest song collections that any album has ever had. Ever. Eight songs, thirty-three minutes and fifty-seven seconds of perfection. The album neither lasts too long nor is is over too quick. It beats the crap out of you and then lets you get up only hoping for more abuse; more Death. \"Flattening of Emotions\" and \"Suicide Machine\" exists as a brutal opening combination only to be followed by \"Together as One\" and the intense \"Secret Face.\" Hell, if that was all that was on this record, it would already be worth the price of a full length. Instead however, we get the lethal quartet of previously mentioned \"Lack of Comprehension\" and three closing tracks that fit perfectly onto the album yet hint at the future direction that death would take with its next three albums: Individual Thought Patterns, Symbolic, and Sound of Perserverance. \"See Through Dreams\", \"Cosmic Sea\", and \"Vacant Planets\" are monumentally intense jazz/death hybrids with a hint of jazz more than the pure fusion of jazz and death metal that Pestilence (latter albums) and Atheist would become known for.\n\nThese songs are ultimately an extension of the musicians themselves, notably Schuldiner. Reinert's drumming is spectacular and compliments Schuldiner and Masvidal excellently. Guitar solos are superb, each one capturing the essence of the song and existing as seperate memorable entities. These musicians and somewhat absent DiGiorgio - who we don't have to mention due to his undeniably incredibly talent - are masters of subtlety. The quick high pitched noises twenty-four seconds into \"Suicide Machine,\" bassist DiGiorgio I believe, and the vocal effects used later on at the end of \"See Through Dreams\" are only two examples. The album's charming quality is found not in the music but in the musician's prowess at adding these minscule yet personal touches to the music.\n\nThis album, \"Human,\" is a peice of art that all must own. It is an example of metal, death metal and music at its very best. The effort and legacy of the musicians on human is unquestionable as is the strength and legacy of the release itself.\n",
        "\nAs with that of thrash, the origin of death metal is still a very debatable subject, even twenty-some years after its inception. Whether it was Possessed, Death, or Master, I do not really care, nor do I feel like pinpointing which of these acts recorded the opening notes in the opening seconds of their first demo's opening song. You can do that on your own time. As regardless of who did it first, each of these bands are important and influential on the genre. With albums such as Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy, Florida death metallers, Death cemented their status as both innovators and torchbearers of the genre. But Death mainman, Chuck Schuldiner eventually grew tired of full on death metal and began incorporating harmonized guitars and progressive influences into his music with 1991's critically acclaimed album, Human. No longer, \"just\" a death metal band, the metal world highly anticipated the return of Death. And with 1993's Individual Though Patterns, they would not be disappointed.\n\nIndividual Thought Patterns continues Death's musical direction into that of progressive death metal. The 40 minute album is still home to the crushing riffs that Death has always employed, but similarly to Individual Thought Process' predecessor, Human, the riffs, solos, and drumming is much more technical than it ever has been before. Each of the album's ten tracks display the talents of Chuck and fellow guitarist Andy LaRocque exceedingly well, with chaotic, evil sounding guitar interplay taking much of the spotlight. But the efforts of the other two band members, Steve DiGiorgio and Gene Hoglan cannot be shrugged off. Similarly to the guitarists, both Steve and Gene do an excellent job in their required roles. Somewhat of a rarity in death metal, Steve DiGiorgio's bass lines are quite audible and provide a solid backup sound to the guitars. Jealousy is one track where Steve's performance plays a large role in the sound of the album. His distinct bass lines are put together rather well and set up a serviceable rhythm for the other members of the band to draw from. If you're a fan of some of the more extreme genres of metal, specifically thrash metal, than you should know who Gene Hoglan is. Similarly to that of Dark Angel's underground hit. Darkness Descends, that element of speed and destructiveness has been added to Death's musical arsenal. Gene offers a very impressive performance which definitely presents a solid, top notch rhythm for the band to follow. However, it would have been nice if the production on his drumming was a little better, as his efforts are rather low in the mix.\n\nIf there was one thing that I wasn't too fond of on Individual Thought Patterns, it would be Chuck Schildiner's voice. Chuck's vocal performance can be described simply as a deep, chaotic shout. Similar to what can be found in thrash metal, yet a little deeper and more gruesome sound, yet not deep or gruesome enough to be considered a death metal grunt. Chuck's efforts keep it rather simple and do not vary much, if at all, and despite being rather annoying, they get their job done fairly well. What his singing does not do is take away from his or the rest of the band's excellent efforts in terms of song writing or performance, but if I could trade in Chuck's shout for a more prestigious death growl, then I would in all likelihood do it, as it would definitely enhance Individual Thought Patterns and its power.\n\nThough I had been listening to Gothenburg and melodic death metal for months before I discovered Death and two of their strongest efforts, Symbolic and Individual Thought Patterns, I would venture to guess that Death was the first full on death metal (though with progressive overtures, obviously) that I had ever given a fair chance to. And I couldn't have picked a finer band to start out with, as Death presents an excellent display of much of what makes death metal a fun genre to listen to. Brutal, yet technical guitars, both in terms of rhythm and leads; unique, effective bass lines which act more as a third guitar rather than following the guitars; and skilled, vicious drumming, which one would expect from a guy like Gene Hoglan. Sure, Chuck's vocals weren't the greatest, and the drumming could have been a little higher in the mix, but in the end, Death's sixth album is indeed a very worthwhile album. Pick it up if you can.\n\n(Originally written for Sputnikmusic)\n",
        "\nI don't know why Chuck ended this amazing album under forty minutes, but damn this is one of my favorite CD's. From start to finish, there is nothing but solid riffs and good (cookie monster) vocals. For those who are new to Death, you may want to start on The Sound Of Perseverance, but for those who are wishing to dive straight into the frenzy known worldwide as \"Human\", be my guest.\nWhat is good about this album? Everything.\nWhy? Chuck, Paul, Sean and Steve all create an atmosphere that makes this album tingle the inner soul of one's soul. Heres how, by songs:\n\nIts clear, by just listening to the first minute of the first track- Flattening Of Emotions- That you are in for one hell of a ride. The double bass madness, and palm muting my Chuck Schuldiner is out of this world. Sean Reinert puts together some of the most solid beats together, while keeping everything within the limits. Replicating it is near impossible unless you have rock/jazz/funk and years of experience under your belt.\nContinuing into Suicide Machine and Together As One, the solid production continues, leaving you with no breaks. Personally, these are done better live, but they are still awesome. I think the first three songs are the cornerstone of Death Metal, as they represent what it stands for: Aggressive, fast, dark vocals which separate us, from the general population.\n\nNow, these following two tracks are LOVED or rejected. Secret face, the next track, tends to lose the people who are not into Death. They do not give the song enough time. The solo is amazing, and I guarantee if you like solos, you will have an eargasm here.\nFollowing this, is Lack Of Comprehension. A great music video (which MTV played only two times in its entire life, because its a fag channel) accompanies this amazing song. I'm sure this song was designed for headbanging/mosh pitting, as Schuldiner and Masvidal pull off some serious 'riffage' here.\n\nNow we get into the See Through Dreams. For most people, who like Death, they feel as if they've had enough. It can start to seem like the same thing at this point. For most though, the speed of Chucks fingers keeps the listener entertained. As this ends, it bleeds into the most infamous Death track ever: Cosmic Sea. This [obviously] 'Cynic' styled track is thanks to Masvidal/Reinert. Dealing with technologies fine insertion, and Chucks amazing 'power metal' like solo, one could feel this as an anthem. Fortunately and unfortunately, it turns into a solid double bass assault. This is bad because the nice Chuck Schuldiner solo ends, but good because now Masvidal can take the shining spot (For once).\n\nThe reason this album didn't get 100 is because of Vacant Planets. A solid track, but by now, this song does not do anything special. I will not object to not listening to it, but it feels worn out by now. I'm not saying the style of the album is worn out, because I've easily listened to this whole damn album four times in a row, just Vacant Planets lacks something that separates it from the rest. Nothing new is brought to the table.\n\nPro and Con time:\n\nPros:\nEvery track is decent, and filled with power chords and superb solos. The backing by Masvidal makes it sound \"Alien\" by the way he plays his guitar, as he tremolo picks 0's, then 6's, then 3's on the same string to give it a 'duuuuh-diiiiii-deeee\" effect.\n\nCons:\nToo short, and revolves a lot around Chuck. Paul cannot shine as much. Bass is sometimes inaudible.\n\nSongs worth listening to:\nFlattening Of Emotions, Lack Of Comprehension, Cosmic Sea\n",
        "\nIt is becoming more and more apparent within the Metal world that certain record labels seemingly have nothing better to do than cash in on an almost infinite list of departed artists, most likely hoping that bands' reputations will sell what are often lacklustre and greedy compilation albums. Karmageddon Media (formerly Hammerheart Records) are one of the biggest offenders of this crime, with constant reissues of albums released under the Hammerheart monicker being churned out and often advertised as 'new and improved' versions. With regard to \"Zero Tolerance\", it is blatantly obvious that the label, unable to obtain the rights to release Chuck Schuldiner's second Control Denied album, simply rushed together a collection of early Death material and some Control Denied instrumental rehearsals with the hope of essentially ripping of the legions of Chuck's loyal fans.\n\nThe history of this release is surrounded by controversy, mainly regarding the untimely death of Chuck Schuldiner in 2001. After Karmageddon Media's continuing battles with the Schuldiner family over the release of the second Control Denied album (which are documented briefly in the booklet of this album) the label was eventually forced to give in and leave the family with the controlling rights to the sophomore record. Unfortunately however, rather than leave the situation alone, Karmageddon saw fit to release this entirely distasteful compilation against the family's wishes.\n\nBoth musically and visually, the release is truly substandard throughout. The four untitled Control Denied instrumental rehearsals are of a poor recording quality, most likely as Chuck never intended for these demos to be heard by fans of the band. Behind the demo sound, the music does genuinely show potential but, without the fantastic emotionally charged vocal talents of Schuldiner and lacking in any bass tracks, these demos set an entirely mediocre standard for the rest of the album. Furthermore, the following six songs from Death's \"Infernal Death\" and \"Mutilation\" demos are, quite unsurprisingly, bland and extremely poorly recorded standard Death Metal tracks; a style which Death, in their creative prime, would eventually move away from, leading to their status as pioneers and forefathers of the entire genre. Tracks like \"Archangel\" and \"Zombie Ritual\" really only serve the purpose of observing the primitive origins of the band and many fans of Death are more than likely to have already tracked down these early demos, hence their rarity is questionable. As far as packaging goes, the listener is presented with a thin black booklet, containing a long-winded statement of intent from Karmageddon Media. There are no band photographs, there is no line up information - there is simply nothing to compensate for this blatant lack of effort on behalf of the label.\n\nTruthfully, this compilation album is a very poor representation of the genius of Chuck Schuldiner and certainly does not serve as a fitting tribute to his legendary musical career. Even those fanatical about Death and Control Denied should approach this poorly constructed album with caution and justifiable cynicism.\n\nOriginally written for http://www.blastwave.co.uk\n",
        "\nOn this demo you can see the songs coming together into what they would sound like on Death's debut, although with slight differences. The sound of the demo is very raw, as is to be expected, but the downside to this is it can occasionally sound muffled and one has to concentrate more while listening to it to grasp the melodies properly, the main example of this being 'Land of No Return'.\n\nThe songs on this demo are nearly the same as they would sound like on Scream Bloody Gore, although there is one exception, and that is 'Zombie Ritual'. The performance seen on this song is faster paced and somewhat more energetic than the one seen on SBG, and as a result it better than the one on Death's debut. The other two are basically same in the tempo and solos, with only very slight differences.\n\nThis is a rehearsal of the songs which would appear on the debut, which is primarily the reason for the songs being almost identical to their respective versions on the debut. I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in Death's demos, if they can get around the somewhat muffled sound.\n",
        "\nTo put it simply, Death's \"Human\" is a classic album. Of course, this is some 15 years after the album came out and the band's leader, Chuck Schuldiner, passed away, which could but add some emotions linked to this album. However, even when this came out, it is hard to see how it would not be hailed as revolutionary among the metal community. \n\nMany things contribute to this album's greatness. Firstly, it is more mature than most of its contemporaries. While some were singing about guts and gore, these guys had deeper lyrics about emotions and pain present throughout the album. Is it due to maturity? Maybe, but then again, most of the members were barely on the plus side of 20. Another factor is the masterful musicianship. In an era of shred guitar dominance, Death not only matches, but at points exceeds the standard of the time. \n\nThe vocals and guitar provided by Chuck Shuldiner are absolutely brilliant! Of course, he has the death metal vocals (cookie monster vocals, if you will), but somehow he communicates more feeling and emotion than you would find in 'classic singers' - not to mention his guitar work, which is absolutely top notch and pushes the boundaries of guitar work within its genre. \n\nBacking Chuck on guitar is Paul Masvidal with his sometimes lead but mostly rhythm work. Being that there are two guitarists in the band, they mold and form the tones and sounds to create a wall of sonic suffocation which you cannot escape. \n\nThe rhythm section of Sean Reinert on drums and Steve Digiorgio provides one of the best rhythm backbones featured on any album. Sean Reinert's drumming is absolutely incredible, a drumming junkie's wet dream. On the other hand, Steve Digiorgio's bass work feels more atmospheric and is there more to complete the sound. \n\nAt this point, I would normally tell you which tracks are key; however, on an album such as \"Human\", there is no reason why you shouldn\u2019t listen to each track. If you don't listen all the way, you're cheating yourself. The worst part of this album is that it is only 35 minutes long. \n\nOverall, Death\u2019s \"Human\" is absolutely stellar. It cannot be reinforced enough on how good this album is, and not only by its contents but what it did to the music around it and the genre.\n",
        "\nSurely much praise has been bestowed upon Chuck Shuldiner and his legacy. Many people proclaim Chuck to be a brilliant guitarist and a musical virtuoso. People also claim that all of his musical virtues are embodied by this very album. Then as always there are those people that dismiss \"The Sound of Perseverance\" as nothing more than a technical masturbation exercise. The opinion of the latter is more agreeable, most of this stuff is technical wanking.\n\nThere is not even the slightest doubt that Chuck Schuldiner possessed tremendous capabilities as a guitar player. Every single guitar solo is an eruption of notes sequenced in consonant melodic fashion. Certainly one must feel every stream of passionate emotions pouring out of every beautiful guitar solo. It's hard to stress just how jaw droppingly amazing these guitar solos are. They are played at lightning fast speeds and with immense technicality, but yet they are just melodic enough to make them sugary sweet and memorable. If there's one reason to buy this album, it is those damned fine guitar solo's.\n\nHowever, guitar solos, or even mountainous technical abilities are just not enough to make a great album. Sometimes technical showcasing simply gets in the way and even tends to ruin a great song. Such is the case with this album. Musicianship doesn't necessarily destroy the album, it just leaves a bad impression. There are some sections of a song which were better left off. These sections are, quite frankly, annoying. They exist merely to disrupt the overall flow of the song. Perhaps the worst aspect of this album is the stale song construction. Every single song is written in repetitive fashion. First they play a series of riffs, some of them random and misplaced, then the brilliant guitar solo flourishes, afterwards the song repeats itself. Just about every song follows this cyclical songwriting. The astounding instrumental ability does not save this album from the lack of variation.\n\nThis album does have a few positive aspects. There are plenty of memorable guitar licks and riffs. Perhaps due to the fact that this is perhaps Death at its most accessible. Most of the riffs contain sappy melodicism with a touch of percussive tendencies. Guitar riffs are played along side a basking rhythm drum and bass backing. On top of all this is Chuck's rather distastefully ugly vocals. His voice is a high pitched, scratchy snarl, and it is not very pleasant to listen to, even for extreme metal standards. Indeed, Chuck mainly relies on instrumentation.\n\nIt is easy to see why one would either enjoy and highly praise this album, yet it also difficult to not see why someone would blast this album. On the surface we have a great deal of astonishing musicianship and barely descent overall song fluidity. However, when one views past this, we are left with wank sections and a lack of atmosphere. And of course no clear artistic intent, just flowery instrumentalism. \"The Sound of Perseverance\" is to be be far from being crowned a masterpiece.\n",
        "\nThere wasn't much like this in '84 except for mabye some early Possessed stuff. This stuff is blazing fast. Exceptionally so for the time. Everyone plays pretty tightly on this demo. There's a little static, but nothing to majorly complain about. It's not far off from a Bathory album in reality if you're talking about production values.\n\n\"Corpsegrinder\" is fast as hell. Just as fast as Chemical Warfare, but I wouldn't say quite as good. This song was later recorded by Massacre. The vocals are really gruff and sounds much more like Kam's vocals, not Chuck's. Although the demo says Chuck does the vocals. \"Summoned to Die\" is another thrashy tune, that's over fairly quickly. \"Zombie Attack\" is a cool instrumental. I actually thought it was going to be an early version of \"Zombie Ritual\", but I was wrong. Parts of this song remind me of Possessed's \"The Exorcist\", because of the way the tremolo riffage as used back then. Which of course was to it's full effect. \"Witch of Hell\" sounds like something that couls have been on Scream Bloody Gore. It strange though, because the production of the demo goes up and down on this one. Pretty fucking cool thrash break and a screeching solo on this one as well too. \"Reign of Terror\" sounds like a Slaughter Lord song in the beginning. More of mid paced, but very evil sounding. The ride cymbal seems off time though at parts.\n\n\nWell worth finding. Pretty brutal stuff. Recommended for any fan of Death, Massacre, Old School Death Metal, or Thrash. There wasn't much else like this in '84, that's for sure.\n",
        "\nFirst things first, the production is the only real let-down of this album I feel, while the drums and vocals sound good and also seem to be in the right places in the mix and the guitars have that awesome sharp and crunchy sound to them, the bottom end sounds muddy (somewhat like on Suffocation's Effigy of the Forgotten, but not that pronounced) and Steve DiGorgio's bass is buried there and it's hard to make out his awesome bass lines (afterall we all know what he's capable of, listen to Individual Thought Patterns) and that is quite a shame.\n\nFrom those first brooding drum beats you know this is going to be something special. The first song, Flattening of Emotions starts relatively slowly but soon explodes into a cacaphony of double bass drumming and violent riffs. The first thing you notice about this albums is what a great drummer Sean Rienert is. He (as well as the other new members) bought a level of musicianship to Death that had not been seen until now and it pays off.\n\nAfter Flattening of Emotions we have Suicide Machine, possibly the best Death song ever written. This song has it all, jackhammer double-kick, brilliant riffs and solos from Chuck and Paul Masvidal, and great bass lines from Steve DiGorgio (strain and you can make them out) as well as Chuck's brutal but decipherable vocals. This is also chucks best vocal performance as well, his growl has the right balance between brutal and understandable (they got a bit too high pitched on the later albums, especially on The Sound of Perseverance). Carrying on from excellent openers the album continues in much the same fashion, which is not say the album gets repetitive, just that it retains its high quality all the way through! Together as one has some great technical riffing that showcases Chuck and Paul's skills on the guitar, and Lack of Comprehension is another high point, with it's soft intro providing a bit of a change in scenery, even once it gets going it is a little slower than the previous songs, but soon picks up the pace yet again, with lightning-fast double kick and Sean showing off his fancy, jazzy cymbal techniques. Cosmic Sea is the one real oddity of the album, a slow, almost fusion-ish instrumental track that Reinert and Masvidal no doubt had a large hand in writing, the Jazz influences are very evident here. It has some amazing guitar solos and we finally get to hear DiGorgio's bass properly. The closer, Vacant Planets is everything one would come to expect for song on the Human album, the usual blend of brutality, technicality and melody into one amazing package.\n\nLyrically this album is great too, with more of Chuck's thoughts and social commentary.\n\nHuman definitely marked the beginning of a new era for Death, and what a great change it was. In 1991 not much else came close. One of my favourite albums from Death and and indeed the Death Metal genre as a whole, truly a must have even for someone with the slightest interest in Death Metal.\n",
        "\nBy now Death had already had numerous lineup changes as well as shifts in style and sound. They went from an almost thrashy and gore filled tone in their debut \"Scream Bloody Gore!\", started showing signs of a bit more complexity with \"Leprosy\", showed hints of proginness in \"Spiritual Healing\" and went balls out full throttle with the awesome release which is Human. But Individual thought patterns remains my favorite Death album and one of my favorite metal albums of all time. Everything is just so perfect here. The lineup was arguably their best(although the Cynic dudes can certainly make a pitch to that claim as well!). With Andy Laroque and Gene Hoglan adding their respective talents to the likes of Steve Digiorgio and the mighty Chuck Schuldiner, this is a record for the ages. \n\nThe tone by now is classic Death, with those major fourth and fifth harmonies running rampant all throughout, leads smooth as butter although played in complex time signatures and odd scales. This record is a musician's wet dream! The songwriting once again is bloody brilliant. \"Overactive Imagination\" is just a choc full of riffs and strange yet intriguing drum patterns that keep me interested throughout. \"In Human Form\" has riffs played so tightly you'd think the band were a bunch of surgeons. The rythm is pummeling and fierce and kicks the listener straight in the face all the while remaining technically brilliant. Tempos shift all around without ever skipping a beat. \"Jealousy\" follows and this track truly shows off the amazing skills of one Steve Digiorgio. Although the guitars as usual are center stage, the bass keeps up frantically and is so keenly tight with the drums while at the same time having standout moments of its own. The solos are once again just peefectly executed. The riffing just flows very well, excellent song.\n\n\"Trapped in a Corner\" is a classic by all means, the track chugs along before going into a groove section which leads into some weird solos played over some odd signatures before trading off into something a little more accesible. This is achieved in brilliant fashion and shows off these guys' chops. Many feel that this might be unnecessary but you know what? If you can do it, then do it! This song is a great piece of songwriting as themes come and go without a hinderance. \"Nothing is Everything\" is another song with some cool rffing that ranges more on the proggy side of things before lashing out in a brutal assault, the riffs are quite catchy actually, making the listener remember them afterwards. \"Mentally Blind\" is a heavier track with some pummeling drumming accompanied by some once again very solid riffing from Chuck and the boys. The chorus is slow and gloomy with some nice ambience to it. The solo is also excellent, fitting the dark mood perfectly. Next comes the title track, and \"Individual Thought Patterns\" doesn't disappoint, being arguably the fastest track along with the opener. The riffing is nice and tremolo and the drums are brutal, heavy and technical. Once again the bass shines through a mist of crushing guitar work. The vocals are also excellent. \"Destiny\" has a very nice clean introduction before getting what is arguably the best riff on the record. This is like headbanging 101, only technical and leads into a more spacey part where Gene Hoglan takes over. The track shifts to technicality with blinding solos and harmonized riffing. This is a rather crushing song that leaves you breahtless upon its competion. \"Out of Touch\" starts off slow and doomy before a malestrom of riffs invades your speakers and the heaviness ensues to dark atmoshperic riffing perfectly complemented by the rythm section. It's all very tight and very groovy at times with those Death harmonies kicking in at any odd moment.\n\nTo close things off we have \"The Philosopher\" Death's most famous track, one with which a music video was created. This starts of with a now legendary tapping line followed by the amazing rythmically syncopated riffing pattern that fits just so perfectly with the vocal patterns. The solos are just perfect and the bass work during the bridge is simply amazing. Things get a little spacey before kicking back into that monster verse riff again. The track fades out after the chorus blasting religion about child abuse and sexual identity. \n\nDeath were pretty balls to the wall with this release, showing more speed than they had ever achieved previously, yet keeoing the Death dynamic intact with the proggy elements and guitar solos. The songwriting is top notch, the vocal performance is also spellbinding. The lyrical IQ is up there considering this is Death Metal we're talking about here. This album is just so enjoyable and so well executed from start to finish, a definite must have.\n",
        "\nDeath are known as true pioneers of the death metal genre and are recognized as a legendary name in the metal comunity. This album has been overlooked over time, mainly because their sound was really evolving at this point. Chuck hadn't yet contacted the guys from Cynic, yet was already leaning towards a progressive sound. The result is very interesting since you can really see that the band were on to something new at this point. \n\nThe riffs are strong and Schuldiner's vocal performance is awesome. His screams really vent out anger and are full of passion and emotion. The tone already has a distinct \"Chuck\" feel to it, with a lot of reverb and those quintessential Death harmonies. \n\nI see Death as band that weren't necessarily THE best at any singular aspect, but they were the best unit. They weren't the fastest, they weren't the heaviest, but their songwriting surpassed anyone in the genre at the time, and this is what makes the music timeless. \n\nAs for the songs, they all smoke, period. \"Living Monstrosity\" has chugging section which are sick heavy and a brilliant vocal performance from Chuck. The songwriting is amazing as always, with the arrangements suiting the music perfectly. However, the standout here has to be the title track, with a chorus so infamous and so mean it hurts. The intro, with its very cool tapping line, is legendary, and the rest of the song is so catchy and features some ridiculous screams from the main man himself. \"Genetic Reconstruction\" and \"Killing Spree\" are also very strong tracks that end the album with a bang. \n\nThe songwriting, as I previously mentioned, went up a notch, and the band started honing a truly unique sound. They were taking huge risks at the time, and maybe that's why this record is sometimes forgotten. But any metal fan should really get aquainted with this, because this is where the evolution of the band's sound really started.\n",
        "\nMantas sprouted as a three piece organism, grew into a mutated parasite and eventually recorded songs in their garage. They were openly inspired by the infamous Venom at that stage, which gave them the drive to sound as vile and nonconforming to the general populace as possible. At one point their name was changed to the fitting moniker \"Death.\" Soon enough, drummer/vocalist Kam Lee was replaced by Evil Chuck Schuldiner on vomits. Meanwhile guitarist Rick Rozz left, and Death relocated and played as a two piece at this point on their debut. Their next output was \"Leprosy,\" which yet again accumulated more members but resurrected old time band mate Rick Rozz at this point and maintained core member Schuldiner. \n\nThis second full length album started a few new ideas and emotions for the young group. For instance, by them including more technical rhythms and leads. Something like what happened with Sodom's \"Obsessed by Cruelty\" compared to \"Persecution Mania.\" Likewise, Death's second album is a little more methodological compared to their debut \"Scream Bloody Gore.\" Death elevated themselves as musicians from their demo days, and this recording is essentially a turning point between their past primitive tendencies and a progressive side that would just keep on progressing till their last output. \n\nThe music on this album is centered around dual guitars, which layer themselves overtop and often accent each other. Some of the main techniques used range from basic and savage to higher noted melodies. They also use single strummed chords while the drummer plays a faster beat, plenty of extended tremolo riffs, power chord and palm muted combos, harmonic squeals and other varied abilities. The leads come about quite frequently. Sometimes they're chaotic by sweeping as many notes as possible, to letting a few harmonious notes escape the tumult, or they can be inclined to crank that whammy bar up and down with intended malice. The drums are often played simplistically but are compensated by weight and heaviness. His pace is usually halted at a steadied thrash beat. It's less drastic than, say, black-thrashers Sarcofago or death-grinders Carcass with their redlining chops at the time. Some of his drumming abilities range from multiple snare rolls and hits, occasional double bass pounding and even taking advantage of an open and closed hi-hat. \n\nChuck's vocals are for the most part a more easy to understand delivery compared to later extreme metal vocals. He gives off a characteristic higher scream and wail, something along the lines of an elevated Jeff Becerra on Possessed's \"Seven Churches.\" He manages to change it up, like on the beginning of \"Pull the Plug\" with a raspy, almost narrative technique. On some other tracks, they can escalate their emotional magnitude as the song builds. It gives them more force compared to some other groups where you can essentially count on them for what they're capable of and where they're most likely going to end up next. Towards the closing of \"Open Casket\" he repeats the title but by using more of a deep, screaming-through-the-teeth voice contortion to dodge a straight-line.\n\nThe production is loud enough to blow the speaker covers right off your cabinets. For an extreme metal band to get this treatment at that time was more of a stepping stone for other recordings that would come after it. The sound quality on the guitars has more of a medium tone since a lot of the guitar lines make the rounds on the fret board, and a lower tone might not have given the particular sharpness they give off when diving below the thicker strings. The drums, on the other hand, are very bassy. For the most part these can be a Godsend and add more weight behind the guitars, but, then again, when he's attacking the snare drum it can sound overloaded in the mix, and almost a distraction compared to giving a single wallop or maintaining a subdued every-other-click beat instead. The bass guitar gets a chance to shine in a few areas, mostly because it isn't strummed lightly, but it gives some back-up to the guitarists using the higher strings as well.\n\nEven in '88, \"Leprosy\" created some dividing points to thrash and death metal. Some of those extended tremolo riffs are a good example of where the techniques would change over compared to the characteristically played rapid, open and closed method that an abundance of thrash metal groups were still using. Along with some other bands, this is another push closer to what more would know in the '90s as to what death metal would develop into in the next phase.\n\nThe song \"Primitive Ways,\" either to not want to contradict themselves in title or lack of drive, is a little more basic. It gets caught in a cycle that needed to be recycled or revamped because it just shuffles around these particular set of notes for a few repeated predictable sections as the drummer hardly deviates with a steady tempo that falls short of unsteadying the listener. It comes across as too aligned for a style of extreme metal that needs more feelings of spontaneity, as if something will reach out and grab you from where you sit or stand.\n\n\"Scream Bloody Gore\" had measured composition but was more basic with song writing in comparison. Then again, that release was primal and had the bludgeoning savageness that came along with it. It was essentially an effectively mean and crude recording. \"Leprosy\" carried over some of the music from that output and also became a little more varied in other areas. Upon delivering those variations, Death substituted areas of being more callous and direct for some untapped progression to set themselves apart from other bands who might have caught on to the initial idea. So, I think the strategy was to slightly move on before anyone could catch up. Even in their instrumentally basic moments, it is still layered and thought through, such as having the bass guitar peak out at points, certain vocal effects being used to enhance a certain line, the drums building up a section and, of course, the guitars jumping in for a lead to heighten a moment as well. This release manages to have some sections that put it ahead of its time, and, even to this day, still have a majority of the music be workable and deliver the goods.\n",
        "\nThis is just a poorly put together \"best of\" album for Death. About half the songs on here could have been replaced with much better ones, and some of the songs that are excluded kind of make you think, \"the guy who put this together must have smoked some bad crack\". \nFirst off, I have a problem with the fact there's only two songs off Human represented here, and the best two (Flattening of Emotions and Lack of Comprehension) aren't even here. I would have taken off Together As One and put those there. Leprosy is represented with three songs: Open Casket, Left To Die, and Pull The Plug. Once again, this has you screaming \"WHERE'S LEPROSY?\" I think many would agree the self-titled song is the best off the album. Their first and very well respected Scream Bloody Gore album is represented with three songs as well: Zombie Ritual, Mutilation, and Baptized In Blood, and once again, it seems like they just drew the songs for this best of out of a hat. Where is Denial Of Life and Evil Fucking Dead?!?! C'mon, that's just inexcusable. Next up and the last album this comp drew from is Spiritual Healing and is by far the worst represented. First off, we only get two songs. We get the great song Spiritual Healing, which I'm very glad to see here, and then we get the boring Altering The Future. C'mon, where's Living Monstrosity? Where's Within The Mind? Where's Defensive Personality? Simply unacceptable.\nSo in conclusion, this is simply one crappy \"Best Of\". I can't think of one good thing to say about it. You're better off just getting the albums. Oh yeah, and the one page of liner notes suck.\n",
        "\nSCREAM BLOODY GORE!!! Everybody argues exactly where Death Metal came from. Some believe that it began with Possessed's Debut album Seven Churches. Other's believe that Death metal came into play when Death released their debut album Scream Bloody Gore. Also, others believe that both of these albums are merely just thrash metal with death elements. Others say that it is just a form of early death metal. I believe that this is just early death, and I also believe that this album is really what created Death Metal. After all, when this album was released, death metal came into place. \n\nSince I can reckon that this is not really a \"tr00\" Death Metal album, or what Death Metal is today, I still believe that it is Death metal, but just an early form of it, and the very first actual Death Metal album. I enjoy or appreciate Death Metal, but I do not whole-heartidly favor it. At least not \"Modern\" Death Metal. My favorite form of death metal is the early form of it. Then again, when I got into metal, I took a different direction into the more vintage sounds/forms of metal, including Early Death Metal. \n\nThis is (as said before) to be compared to Possessed Seven Churches. Though when listening to this album, Death does have Possessed influences including the brutality of Possessed, and more noticable, the vocals. What I think happend was Possessed released a Thrash Metal album with Death Metal influences while Death came along and smoothed it out and creating a more raw type sound to it which is without a doubt, an influential album. \n\nYes it is true that all the songs on the album sound alike, and it is very overrated (especially at first), but as it grows on you, you learn to love it. Since I am a fan of early death metal, this is my favorite CD that I have next to Wrath - Nothing To Fear, and Iced Earth - Burnt Offerings. \n\nOVERALL: Do I reccommend this to metalheads? without a doubt. To Death Metal fans? Obviously, BUT do take into consideration that this is highly argued about to be a true death metal album or not. It is though however and without a doubt HIGHLY influential to Death Metal (if this is not a \"tr00\" death metal album) and I believe that without this album, Death Metal would not be where it is today. That is also one of the reasons why I give this album a SOLID 10 out of 10, regardless if it is overrated.\n",
        "\nOne of a pair of live CD/DVDs released to alleviate Chuck's money problems due to his cancer. A live album certainly was warranted after seven commercially succesful releases but two, with the same line-up and an almost identical setlist? I personally would've wanted to hear some older live material with varied sets and a different line-up. One aspect that I also sorely missed on Live in Eindhoven - and on Death & Raw too for that matter - is Chuck's death vocals. The vocals are the same kind, albeit rawer, as heard on, The Sound of Perseverance i.e. very high compared to what he used on say Leprosy or Human. The instruments too sound like they are mixed higher than usual and perhaps more digital than would be preferable.\n\nConcentrating on the instrumentalists performances, Scott Clendenin is consistently decent. Nothing remarkable but his technical prowess is noteworthy. Shannon Hamm's feats aren't up to his predecessors. His guitaring on the songs from Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance are good but when he tries to play Larocque's or Malone's parts he just falls flat in his face. Richard Christy performs similarly with Hamm. He does well on Symbolic and TSOP-songs but the drum parts on Human and Individual Thought Patterns songs are remarkably duller.\n\nThese facts combined make the listening of this album a cringe-worthy effort. The new production and lacking performance leaves the best part of the album a travesty. Later Death albums are such finesse works that they require more optimal working environment than this. The songs from Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance work better due to Chuck's and the band's recent acquaintance with them and the albums' presence being closer to the sound of the band on this release. Only persons fond of latter era Death should perceive the requisite to procure.\n",
        "\nThis DVD captured Death's 1998 performance at the annual Dynamo Festival, \nat the time, Sound of Perserverance had yet to come out, and this was the SOP lineup's (Chuck, Richard Christy, Shannon Hamm, Scott Clendenin) \nTHIRD ever performance....in front of a huge festival crowd!!! That didn't stop them from unleashing one hell of a performance though...Check it out: \n\nGood Points: \n\nThe setlist is pretty impeccable...with only one hour to play, Chuck picked a pretty sizable look at his career...focusing on the Human album with \"Flattening of Emotions\" \"Suicide Machine\" \"Together as One\" and \"Lack of Comprehension\". He also threw in some progressive workouts like \"The Philosopher\" and \"Trapped in a Corner\" and balanced it out with some great choices from Symbolic, the skull-frying new material \"Flesh and the Power it Holds\" \"Spirit Crusher\" and the ever-optimistic closer \"Pull the Plug\". \n\nThe performance itself is remarkable....Death were one of the TIGHTEST live bands...and it shows in the logic-defying drumming of Richard Christy, and the effortless screaming and riffing of Chuck. Chuck's voice taking on a quality you'd only hear from a witch....being burned....on a stake. \n\nThe camera angles of the show are much more varied than the 2 cameras on the Live in LA DVD...very good atmosphere, although Death metal sounds wierd on a bright sunny day. You can see the GIANT crowd they played for. \n\nIt's just funny hearing the contrast between Chuck's \"california surfer\" speaking voice and his f*cking scary death voice. \"This song is about flesh!\"\n\nBad Points: \n\nThe footage suffers from some BAD syncronization...it never goes wacky when Chuck is singing or playing (cause that would be obvious)...but whenever the drums are shown, it looks like Richard is completley missing every drum on his kit! kinda humorous...but still not cool. \n\nThe sound is not so good in places either...lots of feedback from Chuck's mic...but you barely notice it after a while. This one seemed to be neglected on the production level. \n\nShannon Hamm must have had some problems, cause he frequently messes up on a lot of songs...not to say that Chuck was playing perfect, but some of Shannon's solos sounded like total crap...it's hit or miss. \n\nOverall: It's a no-frills DVD, so don't expect any extras or anything fancy...it's just the one-hour show, but for any Death fan, you just gotta have it. \"Live in Eindhoven\" also has two songs that are not on the \"Live in LA\" set...\"Flattening of Emotions\" and a scarring \"Lack of Comprehension\" benefitted by Chuck's witch vocals. It's rare and worth the moneys.\n",
        "\nSome albums just last forever. Sometimes you'll buy a record and, although it is great at first...time passes and it just loses it's impact. But some records are invincable against the passage of time. They not only retain their intensity, but they grow on you and become a record you can always listen to and be amazed at what's inside. \n\nHuman is one of those records. \n\nThe Production: The production may not be up to the standard of today...but i think the thick, almost menacing sound of Morrisound Studios suits this music just right. The drums, while providing a lot of intricate work, are often overshadowed by the guitars. as for the bass....well, while you can bet that \nSteve DiGiorgio is doing some fine work in these songs, you can barely hear the man. But his time to be heard would be on \"Individual Thought Patterns\" \n\nThe Songs: You can't fail here! \"Flattening of Emotions\" \"Suicide Machine\" \"Together as One\" all awesome! \"Secret Face\" is not completley up to par, but it has wicked riffs nonetheless....You think you might be getting a break when the intro to \"Lack of Comprehension\" comes in....but....THRASH! No you don't! fantastic song, truly impossible riffs, and one of Chuck's most memorable solos. The real break comes in the unique and experimental instrumental \"Cosmic Sea\" which is full of creepy (but kinda cheesy) keyboard work, but is host the best of many guitar duels between Chuck's wierd, angular style, and Paul Masvidal's smooth, almost alien runs. this is NOT filler. The album ends on a fine note with \"Vacant Planets\" which contains some wicked time changes, ripping solos, and a straight to the point ending. \"In a world so vast, we sit among the vacant....PLANETS!\" then silence. then the album is done. flawless. \n\nThe Vocals: I appreciate Chuck's style of screaming, because, although he doesn't use a lot (if any) variation in his vocal style....he makes the effort to make his words clear and understandable, so not only are his words powerful, but the way he delivers them to you can NOT be denied. He doesn't use any of his sick screams like in \"Scream Bloody Gore\" but he has some fine moments on this record. Most notalbly the Bowel-shaking growl in \"Suicide Machine\" (or \"Suicide Ma..(riff) CHINNEEEEEAGH!) \nand when he screams \"As they stare!!!!\" before sending you to thrash hell in \"Together as One\" \n\nOverall: I loved this album the first time i heard it, and everytime i play it, i love it a little more. i get to the point where i'm driving in my car and angrily pointing at people while singing the words to \"Lack of Comprehension\" Intense. I recommend it to any fan of truly unique death metal with originality and a healthy balance of melody and aggression.\n",
        "\nBeing a death fan since an early age of twelve, I have grown more onto Death over the years. First buying the best of then Human, etc... Eventually trying to find Death's Demos. This \"album\" so to speak, not only gives you some of his old demos but live clips from the early days of Death. The Songs on the demos and from the live things (I think) sound better/more brutal than the rest of their releases. I got this in a two disk pack with Zero Tolerance I. This CD is much better...\n\nDemos: The first one is well recorded with some of my favorites from later albums. The demo opens up with Legion of doom, which is a very brutal album with some really low pitched vocals, It's pretty repetative, and not the most creative of Death's work, but it is good. Evil Dead is next and of corse sounds great, the awsome opening riff just swoons me so... The rest of the demo and the second demo are not amasing but do not lack in anything and are everything that one would hope from good ol' Chuck. \n\nLive: Chuck's Vocals are great here and his guitar playing sounds awsome. He likes to talk to the crowd, or so it seems.... Each track has about twenty seconds at the end of Chuck talking to them. You can hear someone hit the mic during the first track which is amusing if you are amused by small things... Anyways, there are no flaws in the live tracks, and you can tell thatr everything is taken seriously by the band. BUY THIS ALBUM/THING\n\nBest song: Beyond the Unholy Grave\n",
        "\nThe fall of great artists can be attributed to many things; fame, superfluous changes of direction, stagnation and populist brainwashing to name a few obvious selections. Yet, these are irrelevant, as they are merely symptoms, not causes. In every case a destructive aphrodisiac, encased in a neat phial, is administered with a sharp injection into the surface of the mind. Its victims are many, few are seen to escape its shocking and hideous effects. Its name is passivity. \n\nDeath used to be a force to be reckoned with, taking to society with a hammer carved out of precise song writing, forever inventive, yet steadfast in thematic coherence. But, on \u201cIndividual Thought Patterns\u201d, many things changed, the most noticeable is the peregrination from Death Metal to an aesthetic based largely around the \u201cmelodic\u201d inclination that was frequented by Traditional Metal bands in the 70s and 80s. With more emphasis on tempo than those aforementioned contemporaries, this is Speed Metal, yet dressed up in a pretty pink costume and paraded before us like a ballerina, minus the grace and beauty. \n\nAs mentioned, Speed Metal is the predominate focus of the songs, but the run-of-the-mill composition lacks the intensity and spirit found in past greats such as Coroner, Cacophony and Judas Priest. It comes off as a hotchpotch of ideas held together with weak glue by choruses, palm-muted tremolo and a selection of misused power chords. The repetition of, then the transience of \u201ctechnical\u201d riffs marred with showy polyrhythmic frolicking dominates, as songs pass in a blur, nothing of memorable value to note. Sure, every now and then an interesting riff arrives, but these are useless when muddled with a myriad of utter mediocrity. The song writing is further taken adrift by a fascination with the incorporating of needless soloing wherever possible, as if we need to know that these musicians are \u201ctalented.\u201d \n\nAs a further hindrance is the production, which is dry-throughout, giving an artificial feel, almost akin to plastic. To suggest that it is as accessible as pop-rock bands would not be too far off the mark. This really does make obvious that the majority of the work presented here is of a similar feel, despite efforts to \u201cspice\u201d things up with an out of place clean acoustic introduction, which adds to the volatility of the album through more incoherence. Also absence is any sense of melody, something that is extremely important to song writing. Sure, there is melody here, but it distracts from the overall flow of the songs, never tying sections together in harmonious flow. \n\nThe drummer and bassist also try to do their bit, but enhanced musicality never solved problems that are based around spirit and drive, or in this case a lack of. The drumbeats are impressive, at least to those who adore pretentious \u201ctechnical\u201d displays, mainly over-drummed, destroying any chance of feeling with impracticability. The situation is likewise in relation to the bassist, as he meanders off into his own little world.\n\nSuch measures equate to the emittance of a gregarious aura that one may find at jam session, in this case helping preach the acceptance of all-accepting egalitarian values in accordance with the \u201cphilosophical\u201d lyrics. Part of the problem seems to be Death\u2019s consistent flux of line-up changes; putting together a group of super-talented musicians rarely makes a \u201csuper-band.\u201d \n\nIf you like music that is loosely based around the concept of writing a song, more for entertainment purposes instead of aiming to achieve artistic worth, then this may be a CD for you. As a whole, this is little more than a promiscuous acceptance of the Judeo-Christian modernity that holds society in a deadlock as we speak, containing music that merely occupies space, instead of filling it with meaning.\n",
        "\nAhhh Death, when people hear this word they usually think one of three things. \"Oh my God I don't want to die!\" \"Death is just a fact of life.\" or \"Death is one of the greatest (or worst) metal bands of all time.\" Naturally us metalheads will think of the third quote before immediately going to first and second quotes.\n\nFortunately for people who love metal a band called Death formed and would be one of the pioneers of the death metal genre.\n\nAs with anything that is new work needs to be done with it before it can become perfect.\n\nIndividual Thought Patterns is one of Death's mid-releases and is the second album I've listened to other than Sound of Perseverance. While it was SoP that had the progressive elements that I so enjoy it is Individual Thought Patterns that heils itself above it's older self. Although the blue prints of death metal had already been written by a younger Death and other bands (early Sepultura and Atheist for example) this album would become a semi-final version of what death metal was to be.\n\nAbandoning the concept of blood, death, and gore \"Individual Thought Patterns\" was mainly about the idea of humanity and religion. With hardly a mention of gore splatter, Death proved with this album that death metal need not to consist of stupid \"Grr hack bits, crush bloody body, rape carcass on the maggott infested floor, grrr.\" lyrics to succeed.\n\nThe music of ITP is intensely good, but is short from perfection. Chuck Schuldiner proved on this release that he is and was one of the greatest metal guitarist of all time, and also one of the best death metal vocalists of all time. Many of the riffs he plays on these songs would be difficult for the average person to play none the less perform and sing at the same time. It's quite obvious that Chuck had training on the guitar not based around the metal or rock genre listening to the way he's able to make certain scales work so damn well with the music.\n\nAnother thing I love about this album are the bass riffs. I know I talk about the bass in most of my reviews but it's because the bass is usually a background instrument to provide the low end. You usually don't hear it, but when it's gone you miss it.\n\nNot with ITP though, the bass riffs are just as skillfully played if not slightly more than the guitar riffs. I love music that doesn't treat the bass like some sort of ignored and abused stepchild.\n\nThe drumming on this album is perfection, and unlike most death metal you don't hear too many blastbeats on this album. The drumming never goes off into it's own little world like some death metal I know *cough* Origin *cough*.\n\nI was especially pleased to come across this album for $5.99. Whoever sold it back must have had some financial burdens because I sure as hell wouldn't sell it back for $1.00.\n\nMy advice is to buy this album if you love Death, or death metal. It gets a 97% because although it could be more differentiating it's still not as redundant as SoP.\n\n97/100\n",
        "\nChuck has proved once again with this CD why he is the envy of anyone attempting to create any form of metal. this is by far the best he has created from his present list of CD's. the most technical, and the best sounding. he didn't just come up with a simple power chord that changed frets by 2 occasionally like alot of Death metal ( i am not trying to knock death metal like morbid angel, because i love those guys, but the sound chuck created with this album was one of a kind back in 1993.) He found the best band of musical talent to produce the album also. the double bass on this album is the best out of all the albums Death has created...the drumming in general is only bested by christy on sound of perseverance. The solos on this album are like nothing done before, and nothing done since. he created the most unique sound with the compelation of all the instruments. i'm not about to go song by song because i'd rather not write a lenghty review for this. but put it in simple term here...i was 11 years old when i bought this album, i'm 18 now,. I don't give a shit who the fuck you are, this is a Great album.\n",
        "\nThis album (along with Sound of Perseverance) are the quintessential Death albums. Enough said. This was the first high point for the band. SOP would be the second and highest. Although the songs are not as epic-like as on SOP, the songs are still deep and emotional, while still retaining that progressive sound Death is more noted for. Every song is a highlight and not once does one become bored with the music within.\n\nOnce the lead track Flattening of Emotions kicks into full gear, you'd better be prepared to take a beating. This is fucking INTENSE riff work and the vocals are just top notch. What really sends chills down your spine is when you've heard the amazing releases of Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy and realize this is the same band. The difference is unbelievable.\n\nSuicide Machine is just as great. This is 100% perfect technical death/thrash. Every riff is memorable and heavy as hell.\n\nTogether as One and Secret Face. Lots of progression and great lead work. This is fast and slow and midpaced and out of control, all in one! Everything flows without flaw.\n\nLack Of Comprehension is easily the best track here, and one of the best songs Death has ever made. Why? This song represents great musicianship and emotion, still without going soft. The verse is full of emotion and a big strength in the song. HOLY SHIT ON A STICK IS THIS A FUCKING HEAVY AS ALL THAT IS HEAVY SONG!\n\nSee Through Dream is the second best track. It's just a full blown attack on the senses. One of the most memorable choruses in all of metal. That's gotta say alot for a death metal band. BEST LEAD SECTION! Melodic, but still kicks your ass in every single place.\n\nCosmic Sea is a strange instrumental. Dark and moody. This is something you wouldnt expect from your average death metal fare. Great musicianship and overall fun to listen to.\n\nVacant Planets closes the album and just murders you. Everyone is on top of their game. Guitars, vocals, bass, and drums are all insane. Nothing can stop this album. Nothing untl SOP came out. Hell, even still...\n\nOne problem... It's so short! Oh well, i really cannot complain.\n",
        "\nDeath, the band that has had many of metal\u2019s great instrumentalists. This album probably has the best line up in Death history. Steve Digiorgio basses away, around the riffs of both Chuck Schuldiner and Paul Masvidal, who create patterns of off-time angular aggressive riffs. Sean Reinert, one of my favorite drummers creating insane drum lines and fills under all this madness. Chuck sounds great on vocals too, with a mid range death vocal, not the bellow, but not the scream, it is perfectly balanced.\n\nThe mix may sound a little too bassy to people, but it grows on you after several listens, and you may get a more trained ear from it, trying to discern the little specialties in Digiorgio\u2019s playing. The album is Death, The songs well-arranged and the lyrics magnificent. Chuck does not play the music around the lyrics, he adjusts the lyrics so they fit, creating an odd sound that is unique to death, with start-stop vocals everywhere. Song like Vacant Planets and Lack of Comprehension stand out as vocal songs, while of course the instrumental Cosmic Sea with its keyboards is amazing. Oddly Chuck has a knack of creating only 4 minute long songs mostly on this album, but it is not much of a problem, it just makes it sound like the songs are the same in structure, due to restricted time.\n",
        "\nDeath begin to take the path of least resistence on \"I.T.P.\" and attempt to bring a sense of \"intelligence\" to their sound. (Something they may have seen as lacking on the earlier releases...) Sadly, this direction also shows the band falling from their daring deametal roots into a more \"speed\" oriented sound that grinds along leaning towards a certain \"hyper-thrash\". The performances here are amazing as usual (you can't expect less from Andy LaRoque right?) and the production is considerably good compared to most death metal oriented releases. Sadly, the overall concept of death is beginning to slip into the typical political metal that removes them from the genre they helped begin. Chuck's \"wisdom\" in the lyrics is rather plain...and his music is starting to lose some of the brutality that marked early death as being the fore-runners of the heaviest sub-genre of metal.\n\nChuck, despite his decay into slightly boring \"thought-death\" still manages to raise a few storms on \"In Human Form\", \"Overactive Imagination\" and \"The Philosopher\". While not as interesting as these few mentioned the rest of the CD is consistent and at least shows a band that has yet to completely devolve into songless skill displays. Chuck may be lacking the huge hooking riffs of earlier records...but his songcraft passes for enjoyable with both occasional hook (nothing compared to Scream Bloody Gore) and heft that managed to keep to drift from traditional death metal...but not weaken into traditional thrash or speed metal. Of course, the above mentioned moments are the only possible classics...but this is not to say that the rest is composed in a poor manner.\n\nDeath took a sharp turn for the worst after this release and I can't say that I care too much. After the first three classics...Chuck had little to prove. This step towards increased complexity also chips away at the engaging nature that made the first few Death albums so fascinating.\n\nOh well...you can't win the all...\n\nhttp://www.hellsrockandroll.cjb.net\n",
        "\nThis was one of the last thing Death did before Chucks passing. And it was a fantastic way for the band to go out. Death delivers in every respect with this live album, playing like their lives depended on it.\n\nThe Philosopher gets the cd going, and it is played extremely well, the band never misses a beat, from there they continue to play a few of their older songs like Crystal Mountain and Zombie Ritual, and some of their newer stuff like Scavenger of Human Sorrow and Spirit Crusher. It's great that the band covers a lot of their discography and they put the same amount of effort in to all of their songs.\n\nChuck the guitar god still manages to play amazingly and sing at the same time even after all of his years of performing, his singing is a little different than what it is in the studio, even though Death do play Death Metal, Chucks voice almost sounds like it could be used for Black Metal, but, none the less, his voice is still great, and is perfect for the music.\n\nThe Drumming on this album is absolutely mind blowing, you can hear them really well, and Richard has a lot of confidence behind the kit, so you know with him you will always get the best drumming you're likely to here, and this cd is no exception\n\nThe bass is what you would come to expect of death, it gets the job done, and is great in it's own right, there are certain parts where the bass does stand out in the middle of certain songs, so it definetly something to listen for.\n\nShannon Hamm is a great compliment to Chuck's guitar work, the 2 work together to bring some great riffs and solos, and none of it is bad at all.\n\nYou get 72 minutes of great Death with this cd, so it is highly reccomended that you go buy it if you are a Death fan, or you at least try it out if you like Death Metal in general, you cannot go wrong with this band ever.\n",
        "\nA 100 percentile rating. That is perfect, ladies and gentlemen. A 100% means there is not one flaw on this album, that means that there is not one mere second, or split second, of averageness, or imperfection. Every second of this album is sheer gory bliss. Scream Bloody Good is right. Death came into existance, thanks to Chuck Shuldiner (God bless him), in 1984. Although some claim that Possesed were, in fact, the first death metal band - I would beg to differ and say Death was the first brutal, pure death metal band. They had all the elements that death metal today has - deathlike riffs hammered out at a relentless pace, machine gun drumming, low, heavy bass and of course - the gutteral screams, grunts and screeches that sound as if a demon were cholking on his main course meal (a brain, of course). 'Scream Bloody Gore' is were everything began.\n\nThe fact that this is one of the first death metal albums ever, means that the genre has not fully developed yet, and influences from other genres of metal can be heard. Although it is quite developed, you do hear some thrash-tinged death licks in here, but nothing that would consider this thrash-death, or even thrash tinged death. It's only a few riffs that have a thrashy feel to them. The drums are relentless in their uncompromising pace, and sound almost like a horse galloping. One great thing about the drums on this album is that they aren't to tight, like most death metal drumming is today. It's very loose sounding, but extremley, extremley fast. Chuck Shuldiner was short a bassist, so along with lead guitars and vocals, he recorded the bass tracks as well. And he didn't cut back, either. The bass is well heard on this album, and very present. Great to know, since they didn't have a bassist - this only once again proves Shuldiners passion.\n\nAll of the tracks on this album shine. They are all slabs of pure death brutality and gory lyrics. But there are some tracks that absolutley shine, and two I would consider among the best death metal tunes ever. You have 'Infernal Death', with it's over the top riffage and Chuck Shuldiner's classic screeches. 'Zombie Ritual' has a harmonized Egyptian sounding riff, then bursts into death metal madness, with a catchy chorus and smoking solo. 'Mutilation' has an awesome main riff, is very catchy (especially when Chuck scream mutilation), and has once again, an awesome solo to boot. 'Denial of Life' is a multi tempo death number, but is a gory shred fest non the less. 'Evil Dead' has some of the coolest riff work ever, and definetly has the best intro of any metal song ever recorded. Which makes it the best song on the album. But honestly, all the tracks shine, respectfully, in their own right. \n\nAnd with this album, Chuck Shuldiner and Co. create a whole new genre of metal, and a legacy. Death will go own to make more totally awesome and killer albums, such as 'Leprosy', 'Human' and many, many others - but this is the cream of the crop. This is Death at the most brutal, goriest, brilliant best. \nIf you consider yourself a metalhead, and don't own this album, you'r a joke.\n",
        "\nWhat can I say? Death is the eptiome of the death metal genre. You would think their first album sounds sloppy and messed up, right? Well first off, this is Death's rawest album out of all of their albums. Their first full-length album is fucking killer. In my opinion, I think all death metal bands should have the production of this album. It has to sound have that rough and raw sound. The reverb on the album is really good. I love albums that use too much reverb. Many people may hate reverb, but I happen to love it very much. Too bad very few death metal or any band for that matter uses reverb. Reverb makes metal sound more heavier.\n\nThis has a lot of elements of thrash in it. Yes, death metal was spawned from thrash, so there are thrash metal influences found on here. I think after Slayer's Reign In Blood came out, it influenced a countless number of death metal bands, including Death. It is evident that Death was influenced by the infamous Slayer album. The songs are pretty damn fast and furious.\n\nThis was made before the spirtual lyrics were ever written for Death. This features some really gruesome and disgusting lyrics. It's all about gore, death, and violence. Chuck Schuldiner was called evil at some point in his career. Just read the lyrics for Evil Dead and Scream Bloody Gore. Those are some pretty evil lyrics. He was 19 going on 20 when this album was recorded. You can listen to his vocals on demos before this album and compare his vocals on SBG. He projects his voice better and it looks like he found himself vocally. He sounds similar to the dude who was in Possessed.\n\nThe guitars on here are really awesome. All of the riffs on this album rock. I really love the riffs on Infernal Death, Mutilation, and Scream Bloody Gore. Zombie Ritual has the most memorable riff. The opening riff kind of sounds Egyptian. Some of the other riffs sound similar on a couple of songs, but I can tell them all a part. There are a few melodic riffs in there too, but not that many.\n\nChuck is a good rhythm and lead guitarist. Although some of the solos sound pretty sketchy, I think it sounds fantastic. The solo for Mutilation is very good. This is the only album that has Chuck doing bass duties. He does a good job handling the bass parts on SBG. Chuck was even a talented guitarist during the SBG days, that's why he also did bass. He's no world renowned bassist, he just gets it done right. If you're a guitarist, then naturally I think you can do bass really well.\n\nChris Reifert is a brutal drummer. He does many of the same beats on several songs on SBG. He may not be the world's best metal drummer, but he can really make the drums sound brutal. He's a simple death metal drummer, I like that. Besides Chuck, it would of been cool if he was a permanent member of Death. He could of expanded his horizons if he stayed in Death. He's without a doubt one of my favorite Death drummers.\n\nI can't really say for sure that it's the first true death metal album, but it is one of the first ones. This should be in every true death metalhead's collection. You don't know what you're missing if you don't own this. From the second I saw the album cover, I knew it was going to sound really vicious.\n",
        "\nThis Death demo definitely has a really raw sound to it. This is the only Death demo I've listened to so far. Infernal Death is the only Death demo I have found so far and I like it. Yeah, the production maybe shitty, but what do you expect? I expected this to be better, but I'm satisfied with what's on it. This is still a really heavy demo.\n\nOn the songs Infernal Death and Baptized in Blood, they sound really good. I'm glad Chuck made them sound better on Scream Bloody Gore. It's interesting to listen to what those two songs sounded like before Scream Bloody Gore. The two songs don't sound as brutal as they do on Scream Bloody Gore. They sound somewhat light compared to what's on Death's debut album. \n\nKam Lee's vocals are OK. I'm not too crazy about them. They sort of sound annoying for a while when you listen to this demo. The vocals could of been a lot better on this demo.\n\nI really like the guitar sound in it. Chuck Schuldiner does an awesome job with the guitar. It may not be the best sounding guitar sound in the world, but I happen to like it a lot. I really love the beginning solo of Archangel. The song also features a lot of cool riffs as well. It's a shame that this song didn't appear on Scream Bloody Gore or other Death releases.\n\nAs for the drumming, I like it a lot as well. It sounds OK, like the vocals. The drumming is fast and brutal. I really think he could of put more effort into the drumming to make this demo really sound excellent. The drums drown out the guitar on this demo recording, but that's OK. It's just a demo. Demos aren't really supposed to sound perfect.\n\nIf you're a diehard fan of Death, check out this demo. It is worth listening to. If you want to hear what the songs Infernal Death and Baptized in Blood sound like before SBG, find this demo right away!\n",
        "\nWell, this certainly is a very raw and heavy hitting demo. The production is piss poor and the drums often dominate the music with annoyingly loud blast beats. The drumming is simplistic, but fairly fast for it's time. Actually, whom am I kidding? The drumming gives me a fucking headache, because the snare is much too loud and often (like I said before) dominates the overall sound.\n\nThe guitar sound, as well as the playing, is top notch. A passionate performance is to be expected from Chuck Schuldiner, who would come to be one of the most inspirational figures in death metal. Chuck's guitar is very distorted, crunchy and fairly muddy, but it gets the job done. The solos stand out a lot, even with the overbearing and headache inducing drums. I can't tell if there is a bass guitar at work, because the drumming dominates everything!\n\nBeing with the frizzy guitar doesn't exactly help. If there is a bass, it\u2019s damn nearing impossible to hear it. Kam Lee's vocals are more of a grunt accompanied by the occasional growl when he's just singing normally, but at times he will do a brutal and blood curdling scream...which is the only highlight when it comes to his vocals. Really, the whole line up should have just been Chuck, as I think Kam Lee is rather worthless on this demo. The lyrics for the songs that appear on Scream Bloody Gore are different...not as cool as the SBG version, but I don\u2019t really care about that too much.\n\nArch Angel doesn't appear on any future work, which is a bit disappointing. Even on a shitty demo like this, it sounds like it could have been promising if Chuck had polished it up a bit. Overall, the demo is worth hearing...but it's nothing to go ape shit over. However, I wasn't really expecting a lot to begin with. I am guessing that it's very rare in the present, but it's not worth looking for unless you are an extreme hardcore fan, or a collector.\n",
        "\nAlthough it\u2019s not considered by everyone to be the first death metal album, no one can deny the influence this album held (and still holds) in the world of death metal. At the time this came out, I can imagine what a lot of people must have been thinking.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this? This is just mindless noise and screaming. This isn\u2019t music!\u201d\n\nKeep in mind, not many people had tried this style of music at the time this was released, so of course many people thought it was arbitrary and needless musical masturbation. I imagine many parents at the time feared for their child\u2019s little ears upon reading the lyrics to songs like \u201cScream Bloody Gore\u201d and \u201cMutilation\u201d due to the fact that they are very gory and repulsive. I\u2019m sure that many parents were concerned that their kids would turn into rampant murderers from being influenced by this new \u201cevil\u201d music which happened to be growing steadily among teenagers at the time. To back up the malevolent lyrics is some pretty intense music.\n\nDeath metal was born from thrash; so naturally, you\u2019ll hear plenty of thrashy elements similar to Slayer, Venom, and other bands like them. There is a lot of fast and steady drumming, which sounds sonically dense and deep on the tonal level. The frantic barrage of drums adds to the violent and unstoppable rage that this album possesses. Bone breaking guitars give the music the heavier edge it needs to help differentiate it from your standard thrash. Clearly, this is Death\u2019s most primitive and unbridled album - lyrically and musically.\n\nAlong with the drum assault comes the gritty and spiky sounding guitars of Chuck Schuldiner. The screaming guitars are rather sharp in tone and calling the overall sound \u201cugly\u201d would be a compliment. The introductions of each and every song is fairly interesting, which makes it easy to grab the listeners attention and pull them into the storm of insanity that follows. While the slabs of rhythm are busy crushing your bones, the brittle and dark leads emerge from the dark and hold you down by the neck with a rusty knife. The bass is easily heard in the mix while it attacks the empty spots left behind by the drums and guitars.\n\nChuck\u2019s vocals are nice and harsh, sounding similar to Jeff Becerra from Possessed. You have got to love the lung collapsing screams in \u201cInfernal Death\u201d especially the guttural and shrieking \u201cDIE!!!!\u201d. You want some monstrous growls straight out of Hell? Well, here you have them. This album is an entire reign of death and brutality packed into one little disc.\n\nOne can debate over whether or not Death was the first death metal band. Although Possessed released Seven Churches first, they both formed around the same time. However, Death stands over Possessed with it\u2019s twenty some demos before they actually released an album, which is evidencing that Death probably could have released a full-length first. Even though Death came second, their first full-length tunes are much more memorable, powerful, and gruesome than that of Possessed. If you are at all a fan of death metal you have no excuse for not owning this.\n",
        "\nI don\u2019t know what it is about the Halloween theme playing in the background before the real music starts, but to me, it sets the energy and anticipation perfectly for the haughty musicians before the concert comes crashing in with the ever-classic song \u201cThe Philosopher\u201d. Ahh, what a perfect start for a live show. Chuck is on the ball with his new aged raspy screams and screeches goes above and beyond with an obvious vocally stressful performance (after all, it was singing all those years that transformed his deeper growls into his new demoniac wraith induced screams). A little look at the material: three songs from The Sound of Perseverance, four from Symbolic, one from Scream Bloody Gore, two from Individual Thought Patterns, two from Human, and one from Leprosy. Not a bad choice of material since it can be applied to any fans that find a particular interest in any era of Death.\n\nOnce again Chuck shows that if the line up isn\u2019t the best, it doesn\u2019t fly. Scott Clendenin (although no Steve DiGiorgio) does an excellent job at filling in the bass slots. I\u2019m not sure what kind of equipment Scott was using, but his sound fits perfectly in this live performance. You can hear the click of his bass in the back, filling in the gaps and meshing the guitars with the heavy hitting drums. I\u2019m sure a good amount of people are aware that it can be arduous to hear the bass during a live performance; well, those who are always searching for clear bass, look no further.\n\nFor you have found a live performance with stand out bass that actually kicks and amplifies the brinks of the overall tone. Chuck\u2019s wailing Stealth takes the stand to deliver the goods and does a fine job. The teeth gritting, screeching solos go overboard and make you feel as if your brain has just been pummeled by a wave of technical Hell. Shannon Hamm proves to be a good replacement for Andy LaRocque as he performs the hypnotic solo in Trapped In A Corner; immediately, all doubt is erased. Richard Christy also proves to be a meritorious selection to fill in for Gene Hoglan, as he performs Scavenger of Human Sorrow and everything else with ease.\n\nRichard\u2019s drums have a heavy and meaty sound to them, especially the snare. You could go as far as to call this a best of compilation album, because almost all of the best Death songs are on here. The only problem is that some of the palm muting parts in Zombie Ritual can be a little scanty in volume, but if you\u2019re blasting this in your stereo you\u2019ll hear it just fine. I am a little confused as to what exactly the band was playing before they got to the actual song \u201cPull The Plug\u201d. The track starts, but what they are playing isn\u2019t Pull The Plug.\n\nI have no idea what it is, but it sounds awesome, swift, and mesmerizing. A few times during the album Chuck states that they are running low on time and have to cut out a couple of songs. It peaks my interest to wonder what songs would have been added, given if they\u2019d had the time to perform them. Personally, I would have liked to see at least one song performed off of Spiritual Healing, but beggars can\u2019t be choosers, I suppose. Either way, all the songs are performed perfectly - no mess-ups, no weird tempo changes...just pure raw Death.\n\nDefinitely not a live album to end all others, but it ranks fairly high. If you\u2019re interested in the CD you should also try to pick up the VHS or DVD of this; it\u2019s well worth the money.\n",
        "\nI think this is one of Death's most interesting albums, aside from Human. Musically, the album sticks out like a sore thumb, and it remains interesting lyrically, as Death always has been unique in the lyric department. This is the album where Chuck's voice becomes significantly higher in pitch, but he can still deal out vocals like he always could. Chuck decides to keep Steve on bass, pick up Gene Hoglan for drums, and Andy LaRocque for guitar. Although not my favorite line up it\u2019s still excellent.\n\nYou can actually hear the fretless bass master\u2019s fills, which gives the album a kick and really puts the sound out there. Steve is perfect for this album and he really gives it a unique sound with his amplified bass fills. Andy\u2019s solos blend beautifully with the flow of the music, and most of my favorite Death solos come from this album. Gene Hoglan is a monster on the kit, smashing away as if it requires no effort for him. I think this is probably Death\u2019s most technical album, but Death don\u2019t make the same mistake that a lot of bands make when they go technical, which is direction.\n\nSome artists get lost in technicality and have no clear direction of where they\u2019re going with the music, but that doesn\u2019t happen here. Every single solo is a blistering fest of emotion and intricasy. The solos are also pretty long on this album, which I love. The solo on Trapped in A Corner is probably my favorite Death solo of all time. After watching it on Live in LA and hearing it over and over again, it gets beaten into your brain until it becomes a part of you.\n\nEvery single song is ripping and screaming with technicality and carefully placed riffs. The music seems to have a really big \u201cpush\u201d to it\u2019s sound, not just because of the blasting bass, but because of the speedy and precocious guitars, blended with the heavy pounding drums. My highlight songs are Trapped In A Corner, Jealousy, In Human Form, and The Philosopher. However, each song has it\u2019s own highlights and special parts to it. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably the most unique album Death have ever done, and it is a must have for any Death fan.\n",
        "\nThis is where it all began. In 1987, Scream Bloody Gore was released. At the time many Death demos had been heard and this release was long-awaited to say the least. The production is minimal and there aren't too many fringes here, but this is one of the very first death metal albums ever released and influenced and inummerable amount of bands...and still continues to do so. The songs are all at lightning-speed tempos, and relentlessly heavy. Chuck Schuldiner's inhuman vocals are extremely deep, rough and...for the most part indecipherable...a vocal style that would influence countless bands. You'll be hard pressed to find melody here except for in a few of the short solo's. Chuck Schuldiner would end up to become one of the most technical and complex guitarists in extreme metal history, but at this point he was not quite the guitarist he would end up being...though it's obvious he was very original and had a very, very clear vision. Vision is the most important thing as musician and Chuck Schuldiner was oozing it. The lyrics are pretty much based on B-rate horror films...which I love so it kicks ass! With song titles like \"Regurgitated Guts\" and \"Evil Dead\" you can also expect some pretty gruesome and gory lyrics...and there is no shortage of that. Some lyrics on this album are similar to the kind of lyrics Cannibal Corpse would end up writing some years after this release. Take note that althought it says John Hand plays rhythm guitar on this album...this is not true. He joined the band shortly after this album was recorded and showed up on the record sleeve...however, Chuck dismissed him before so much as one gig. So officially, John Hand never played a single not with Death...live nor in the studio. Chuck Schuldiner does both guitars, bass and vocals! He's incredible. The only duty he didn't pick up was the drums. The re-released version contans two bonus tracks which are Land Of No Return and Beyond The Unholy Grave which were supposed to originally appear on the album, but were cut. If you order from here, you will get this version. I would say the stand out tracks here are Zombie Ritual (played at just about every live Death performance...ever), Evil Dead and Infernal Death. The whole album will have you flipping out and headbanging though...with a doubt. In closing, this is the start of the legacy of Chuck Schuldiner and Death. This genius would on to write the most meaningful, complex, technical and inspiring masterpieces ever in ulta-hard music. This album is very different than later releases such as Individual Thought Patterns and The Sound Of Perseverance, but you can definitely sense the musical mastermind Chuck Schuldiner would become listening to this album. God bless you, Chuck Schuldiner...you will never be forgotten. We love you...LET THE METAL FLOW!\n",
        "\nWhen I first listened to this album, I was a bit skeptical and more partial to Death's newer material than the older. However, after blasting this album in my car, I was stunned with awe. Then I realized why this album had received such high praise. This was a turning point for Chuck Schuldiner and Death. Human was Death's first effort to deliver speed, technicality, heaviness, and melody...and they succeeded!\n\nIt seems Chuck has matured with his lyrics, while his brutal death metal vocals remain the same. The guitar riffs aren\u2018t the most complex, but this is still a fairly large step for Death and they still manage to make unique tunes that actually sound good. The guitars have a raw and thick sound with a dosage of melody. Although Steve DiGiorgio is an awesome bassist his bass sounds like total crap in some parts of this album. Listen at around 0:24 into the song \u201cSuicide Machine\u201d and you hear what sounds like a rubber band, but it is supposed to be Steve\u2019s bass.\n\nThe drumming is rather burly sounding; nice and thick. Sean proves himself a worthy drummer as you listen to the dismal drums which take you into \u201cFlattening of Emotions,\u201d as well as \u201cTogether As One\u201d. Paul shows that he can fill the shoes of metal guitar guru - James Murphy by playing his parts with obvious ease. It sure was nice for the members of Cynic to lend out their two best men. Yet again, Chuck shows that unless the line up is perfect, it doesn\u2019t fly.\n\nMost of the songs are fast, with the exception of the beautifully welded instrumental - \u201cCosmic Sea,\u201d which more than makes up for lack of speed with carefully placed rhythm and humming melodies. There is even a quick little bass solo in this instrumental. This is a nice fresh listen - it contains expeditious speed, heaviness, with a nice dab of melody while keeping intelligent and unique lyrics in constant presence. Sad enough, music isn\u2019t made like this much these days. This is one of the album I own that I can listen to all the way through without the desire to skip any tracks.\n\nAt this point in time, this was a huge step of advancement in Death's existence. I would go as far to say that this album is a classic and should be owned by any and all death metal lovers. Hurry up and buy it if you don\u2019t own it yet.\n",
        "\nDeath\u2019s role as a pioneering metal band can\u2019t be noted enough. Any early work by Death is no less holy to death metal than the Holy Grail is to the Church, and while death metal didn\u2019t originate from Death\u2019s \u201cInfernal Death\u201d demo (that honour belongs to Possessed and their early recordings, \u201cDeath Metal\u201d and \u201cSeven Churches\u201d, which were heavily influenced by Hellhammer), it did inspire and spawn the creation of more death metal bands.\nEpitomising adolescent horror, Death shocked with their inspired 1985 \u201cInfernal Death\u201d demo, a product of \u201cEvil\u201d Chuck Schuldiner\u2019s B.C. Rich and Kam Lee\u2019s outrageous for the time, screeching vocals. \nFeaturing sludgy riffs over thrashing drum beats, rolls and crashes, hatred filled satanic lyrics and screaming vocals that sounded like someone was being tortured, Death\u2019s unique dark, moody and above all extremely heavy music worked wonders as they became legends of the underground tape trading scene. \nFrom Lee\u2019s sick screams of \u201cDie! Die! Die!\u201d at the beginning of \u201cInfernal Death\u201d, to the chaotic solo and furious speed of the legendary \u201cBaptised In Blood\u201d, to the bludgeoning riffs, beats and killer vocals of \u201cArch Angel\u201d, Death were creating something unique that would result in the development of a metal genre that would raise the bar for extreme music. \nSure, the production and sound's shit, and Chuck seem to be too fast for Lee's drumming capabilities, but at time when this type of extremity was rare and both members teenagers, it'd be downright wrong to punish this demo on those stupid accounts.\nSo, to give this a score less than 99 is blasphemy, and punishable with eternal life in heaven. And we wouldn\u2019t want that, would we?\n\nChuck Schuldiner, R.I.P.\n",
        "\nTalk about a huge improvement in every department from Leprosy. This is still done in a similiar style to Leprosy, a bit less brutal though (lyricaly and a little musically), but it improved about it in a bunch of ways. On Spiritual Healing Chuck & Co. (the classical line up with Terry and Bill) have improved upon their skill greatly. Chuck's song writing has greatly improved, on Leprosy sometimes the songs can be a bit lacking, on Spiritual Healing the complexity and song structure keeps the songs enjoyable from begining to end, all of them. Chuck's guitar playing also improved, but he had help from the great James Murphy, so all credit can not go to him. Bill Andrew's drum playing is amazing as compared with Leprosy, its much faster and more interesting. He seems to do more than just follow along with the rest of the band, at times he will focus the songs attention on his drumming like on the end of Spiritual Healing (track five).\n\nWhat makes this album more break through for Death is that chuck switched from gore charged lyrics, to a political/social frame. The majority of the songs on this album focus on political or social issue like abortion or the death penalty. More social issues are delivered such as humans being stupid and placing so much value on the accumulation of wealth and petty material possesions and ignoring larger problems. Although Spiritual Healing is just an improvement upon Leprosy musically, the lyrics make them sound like two different styles of music. The gore lyrics of past Death made their songs seem darker and more evil, while the political/social lyrics make the band, this album, have a more serious and valid sound, like the band is saying something informative or important on this album. Death metal is dominated by fantasy, mythology, gore, death...etc, lyrics such as that, so its nice to see some death metal with a political/social lyrical content ( I am not saying Death is the only band that does this).\n\nThe guitar work on this album is most impressive. The riffs on Spiritual Healing amaze me, they are complex and origonal. Chuck and James deliver long rolling riffs that don't take a back seat to the vocals or drums on this album at almost all times. They range from slow to fast, and have a sutble brutality to them, unlike the more blatant in your face guitars of Leprosy and Screaming Bloody Gore. The solo's are equally amazing, they are so long and non repeatative. Each solo from each song is totaly different and not borrowing from other solo's on this album. Up to this point(1990) this is Death's best work lyrically and musically.\n\nTracks that stick out and are memorable are Living Monstrosity and Altering The Future for their socialy edgy lyrics. Spiritual Healing and Genetic Reconstruction offer alot musically, that makes them memorable. All the tracks on this album have thier moments, none are lackig in any department. Its a consistent listen from Living Monstrosity to Killing Spree, for any Death fan of their older stuff (like 1987-1991).\n",
        "\nNoramlly I hate best of/compilation albums for bands that are still active and/or for bands that have been around less than ten years. Here we have just that...except for one thing, its not that bad a compilation, its done quite well. \n \nOn Death's previous releases they have tons of great songs of the four albums...and a good many that stand out. This here compilation has managed to capture all the songs that stand out among the barrage of allready good Death songs up to this point. They included the best of Screaming Bloody Gore: Zombie Ritual, Mutilation. The best of Leprosy: Open Casket, Pull the Plug. The best of Human: Suicide Machine, Together As One. They messed up on Spirtual Healing though...the band didn't put on Living Monstrosity, the most powerful song of the band from that album. Aside from that they captured everything up to this point well without polluting the album with 15 plus tracks.\n\nThis album is easy to find new and used, for cheap...its a great record you can get for around 5 bucks to see if you will like Death's earlier stuff. Other than this though it serves no purpose. Its put together well...and aside from a missing track or two that should be on here its done well. This though serves no purpose to Death fans who, or will, own death's albums...for that I take off points.\n",
        "\nIndividual Thought Patterns was my first Death CD that I ever got. When I put it in and started to listen, I was blown away. This has got to be the best Death line-up ever. Gene Hoglan is a great drummer, Andy LaRocque blends in some beautiful solos, Steve DiGiorgio is audible on here, and you can here his awesome bass fills. Then there is Chuck. I think almost everyone in the Metal scene knows what Chuck did. The guitar work on this CD is near perfect. \n\nThe first track, Overactive Imagination, is a great opener. It starts out fast, and changes into an even faster verse.\n\nIn Human Form has one of my favorite Bass lines ever. It has some great riffs and Chucks screaming sounds great.\n\nJealousy has to be one of the most technical songs on the album. Gene throws in some triplets at odd times, which work very well. \n\nTrapped in a Corner is a classic. The drums seem to overtake everything in the song with what Gene is doing. Sure, the solos are great, but Gene is doing some very complicated shit. \n\nNothing is Everything has the same, High-hat/Ride attack from Trapped in a Corner, but it still sounds good. Once the song gets to Chucks solo though, it really picks up.\n\nMentally Blind is one of my favorite Death songs ever. Why? Because of the drums. Gene again rips it up, especially the ending. If you listen to the ending, the double bass is probably the fastest he ever went. Not to mention the great bass and guitar work. Chuck really knew how to write some great songs.\n\nNext comes the CD's title track, Individual Thought Patterns. The song is slower than most of the other tracks, but it makes up for that in Heavyness and Technecality. \n\nDestiny starts out acoustic. Just Andy playing. Then that fades out, and into great song with alot of melody. The Chorus is one of my favorites, being an Old School Death type song, screaming out the name of the track.\n\nNumber 9 is Out Of Touch. A song that starts off slow, and then turns into almost a full on thrash song. It's very fast, and probably helps with Genes work with Dark Angel and Testament. The guitar is awesome, like amost every Death song, and you can hear the little things Steve is doing.\n\nThe Philosopher closes out the CD. The intro is sort of dark, and goes great with the song. Everything is great. Chucks solo and his vocals take over the song, and that's what make it great.\n\nOverall, this CD is goddamn near perfect. The only problem is the song time, and the production. It's very quiet, and if you turn it up too loud you can hear the quality get worst. But, overall, it's a great CD and a must have for anyone who loves Technical or Death Metal.\n",
        "\nThis was my first Death album that I bought and I thought it was pretty good. But upon \"The Sound Of Perseverance\" being constantly in my CD player, this is no longer my favorite Death album. But that is a very small complaint, as most of the music on here is very good.\n\nThe music is very melodic and the production is very good, without the music straying toward the Gothenburg sound. I happen to prefer the Gothenburg sound a little better, though. There are also some head-spinning time changes, especially in songs like \"Zero Tolerance\" and the opening title track. Chuck Schuldiner still has a good voice at this point in his career, but he's given way to more of a scream. In other words, if you are expecting the growl that he displayed on Scream Bloody Gore and Leprosy, you're going to be disappointed. But his scream is just as effective as his growl.\n\nNot to be outdone by his voice, this album and has some of the best guitar shredding by any death metal axeman. Check out the solos in \"Sacred Serenity\" and \"Without Judgement\" for some examples. But my favorite song from this album is \"Misanthrope\", which in my opinion has one of the best death metal choruses ever. Gene Hoglan handles the double-bass drumming with ease on this track and most others as well. \"Crystal Mountain\" is a strong track as well, with more awesome shredding.\n\nThis is still Death and the genre they helped invent, even with the more melodic elements. But fans of more brutal death metal like Cannibal Corpse and Morbid Angel may be disappointed by this release. Ahh well, it's their loss. I say, though, it's a rather fitting testament to the legacy that is Chuck Schuldiner (R.I.P.)\n",
        "\nThe statement above (the title) describes the lyrics of the album, which involve Chuck's views on various social issues such as the death penalty, cloning, and vigilante justice among other things. Due to this the lyrics are a step forward from the clich\u00e9d gore lyrics that were present on the first two albums. Along with the lyrics, the music took a change in direction on this album, beginning to go in a more technical direction with less focus on brutality, (a style which would later be explored further in Human and the future albums to a much greater extent) and although most of the past brutality remained, there was a step up in the quality of the song writing, along with improved musicianship, which was complemented with more complex riffing, many (meaningful) tempo changes throughout the album, and better guitar solos. And the addition of James Murphy as a second guitarist didn\u2019t hurt, either. The production gets the job done, but is somewhat flawed. The good aspects are that it's relatively clear, but not so too clean for a death metal album, nor does it sound sterile, the bass is too low in the mix, though. The main problem in the production is with the drums which are pushed too far back resulting in some of the potential power of the album being lost. \n\nPersonally, I find this album to be highly under-rated; even though it was a landmark for Death it lives in the shadow of the next album, Human. However it's also a great album. \n\nThe album starts off with Living Monstrosity, which is a great opening track. A very aggressive, high speed intro leading into Chuck's unique growling vocals, and then switches between mid and high speed riffing, leading into dueling solos by James and Chuck about half-way through the song, before reverting back to the pattern that the song started in, and all of this is topped off with socially conscious lyrics about drug addiction. \n\nAltering The Future is next, one of the highlights of the album musically and lyrically, this song relies primarily on mid-paced riffs, up until Chuck comes out with a solo, which is followed with a faster one by James, then once again reverts back to the riffing style that was in the beginning of the song. It's hard to say exactly what makes it a stand out, so the best thing I can say is to listen for yourself. \n\nNext up is Defensive Personalities, one of the weaker songs on the album, although it's not a bad song, it simply doesn\u2018t stand out, it has good drumming, riffs, and solos, but it just doesn't have anything that makes it stand out from the rest of the album. \n\nWithin The Mind is similar, however, somewhat more memorable. \n\nNext up is the center piece of the album, the epic title track, and the highlight of the album: Spiritual Healing. A slow, epic sounding riff opens up the song, which shifts up into a higher tempo, more aggressive riffing, and vocals come in. From this point the song continues on at the same pace, until settling back down into the slower riff, and then two solos emerge around the four minute mark. Afterwards, the song reverts back to a very slow paced riffing, until another tempo change, which leads back into the faster riffs from earlier, which the nearly eight minute long epic ends on. \n\nLow Life, is the next track, and is a very aggressive and angry song with more great riffing and six solos in a row, plus some clich\u00e9d but well written lyrics, making it another highlight of the album. \n\nAnd now, as the album nears a close Genetic Reconstruction is up, with a very interesting mid tempo riff leading into the song, until another tempo change comes along, while Chuck spews out lyrics about cloning and it's affects on a fantasy. This, like every other song on the album (they tend to follow a pattern), leads into some good guitar solos by both James and Chuck, and then going back into the riffing, the bass coming through yet again, until the song ends with a mid-paced riff. \n\nThe final song is Killing Spree, with lyrics dealing with school shootings. The song employs very aggressive riffing, although it slows down into mid-tempo as a set up for the two solos, which then reverts back to the aggressive ending before, until the end of the song, which bookends the album nicely.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an under-appreciated classic in early death metal, give this album a try.\n",
        "\nRetaining the distinctive flavour that made \"Scream Bloody Gore\" a notorious release at the time, but having a newly polished and sharpened edge, comes \"Leprosy\". Leprosy comes across as a more concentrated and controlled effort than before. Pretty much everything has improved: songwriting, musicmanship and even lyrical content. The lyrics show more maturity, but still lack much of the sentiment and philanthropy that would later dominate Chuck's writing. A six minute long title track displays this new found control and accuracy, giving increasing emphasis on the kind of melodic passages that would become synonymous with the band (only hinted at briefly on \"Scream Bloody Gore\"). The only real annoyance in the music comes in the form of guitarist Rick Rozz's unispired, all to similar lead work. But fortunately, Chuck's solos manage to breathe much needed life into each song, helping to wash away the bitter taste of Rozz. Chuck also has this knack of spicing up the music with imaginative bridges and lead breaks just at the point when the repeating riffs begin to get a little monotonous. Though this is great, and Chuck is developing a style all of his own, it isn't as interesting, together or progressing as much as would hit with full force on their next release \"Spiritual Healing\". The best examples of promise in the band's ever improving technique come in the title track, \"Forgotten Past\", the brutal and crushing \"Pull The Plug\" and \"Choke On It\". If you enjoyed \"Scream Bloody Gore\" then this is definitely recommended as it's better in all aspects.\n",
        "\nRaw, unrepentent and unforgiving... and I can listen to it? In my search for rich and complex metal, Death's \"Scream Bloody Gore\" fails to fulfill many of my requirements, but somehow it impresses. It is a bludgeoning, nihilistic ride to Hell for certain, but one that really needed time to seep into my mind. No longer can this album be impressive on account of its extremity, which has been far surpassed. But it does have an infuriating energy and attitude, from the frantic \"Infernal Death\" through the infectiously catchy \"Zombie Ritual\" to its firey conclusion at the title track. Song structures are simplistic and generic, in the vein of early black metal bands like Venom, but provide enough riff changes to hold things together well. It's not all out speeding brutality with the occasional slower passage here and there, with hints of almost groove like catchiness abound. The musicmanship itself is very much full of life and enthusiasm, and shows promise, but not to the extent of predicting just how much Chuck Schuldiner would further himself as a musician (part of the beauty of listening to Death evolve). We also have here Chuck's vocals at their most frighteningly intense. The album as a whole is pleasingly dark, from the dank, murky cover artwork, to the nihilistic and gore ridden lyrical themes that would pervade the genre of death metal within the next couple of years. If you are new to death metal, this would be a very good place to begin your journey, but if you only want the most essential works, start at the \"Human\" album.\n",
        "\nDeath brought a new approach to the way they went about writing music with Individual Thought Patterns. Basically Chuck recruited some of the finest musicians to ever walk the face of the earth: Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel), Andy LaRocque (King Diamond), and Steve Digiorgio (Sadus). That is the reason why this is such an utter shredfest with all the musicians putting their sence of genuine genious into each and every song. They just wanted to make the best and most Technical Death album to date, and when this was released i truely believe this was their crowning glory. But Individual is missing a few things, one of the things is that Chucks voice is not nearly as good as on Symbolic or Human.But either way it suits the music, so i really shouldnt be complaining.Another thing is that some of the tracks are not as memorable as the tracks on next two cds they released. Holy shit Gene puts out his best performance ever on any other cd i have heard him play on, hes a fucking mammoth on this disc. Just when you think theres no one better than Buddy Rich here comes this guy, just outstanding. Steve plays plenty of awesome fretless bass, and ofcourse the bass playing is very audible in the mix. Chucks lead playing has also come a long way since Scream Bloody Gore. Their solos are sorrowful and emotion gripping, I love each and every one. \n\nSome of their biggest acclaimed songs are displayed on this album. Tracks like Overactive Imagination, In Human Form, Trapped in a Corner, Nothing Is Everything, Individual Thought Patterns, The Philosopher. This is Indeed a must for any Death metal fan, or highly technical metal lover. I must say that Andy LaRoques guitar playing is jaw dropping...listen to his solo abit over 2 minuites into \"Trapped in a Corner\". This album reeks of creativity, that is catchy, and very easy to get into. Although not the best death album this was the start of a glorious extreme metal era for them. I truely believe their best works were from Human to Sound of Perserverance. Leprosy never did anything for me neither did Spiritual or Scream Bloody Gore. When they got emotional and technical is when i started caring about them. They have matured and it is shown on this release, I hold nothing but respect for each and every musician on this album, and give them my biggest thank you for helping a Metalhead in need of a good technical fix. I hold my glass high for Death...Cheers Chuck I'll see you in Life after Death. \n\nBest Tracks: Whole fucking Album\n",
        "\nOh...everything in this demo is just absolutely fantastic, except for, the production, the sound, the lack of mixture between the guitar and drums, the vocals, the cover...etc...\nBut, one thing does not suck...the songs are still infernal and those were the first Death songs, (a little bit after they changed their name from Mantas) that would enter in their debut years later...\n\nWell...it's a demo, and it's too fucking short, but hey, it's DEATH, the only metal band capable of recording more than 12 demos without releasing an album (this deserved a Guinness book record!!!!)!!! So...there's really not much to say about it...\n\nThe line up had only Chuck \"in middle puberty wanking maniac Satan worshiper\" Schuldiner on voice and guitar, and another guy named Lee playing the drums. Well if you are used to listen to Chuck's vocals in albums like \"Leprosy\" and \"Scream Bloody Gore\", forget it...this is \"got laid for the first time yesterday\", aprox 17 years old Chuck Schuldiner... Imagine this little kid trying to imitate Satan speaking himself, multiply it by 10, and you'll have an idea of what Chuck was about...But, and for most incredible it may seems, he still managed to sound diabolic and evil. \n\nThe guitars are always one step in time in front of the drums, sounding like the drummer had difficulty in reach Chuck's speed...It's a very thin guitar sound and those drums must have been played only with a snare drum, a bass drum and two cymbals...\n\nThe songs here are:\n\n\"Infernal Death\": Not bad at all, taking in consideration that the true death metal should sound like this, it's not that bad. Chuck sings ok, and plays in a competent role, but accelerating a little bit, eventually killing the drum sound...\n\n\"Baptized in Blood\": A somewhat of a butcher...In this one Chuck goes at light speed, while the drummer goes at \"sitting in a camel crossing the Sahara desert in the middle of day\" speed. My god...only those precious riffs save it...\n\n\"Archangel\": Fantastic and catchy riffs, but not managing to be in a higher level than the previous two...\n\nThis is a good item to get for Death fans...but this quality is awful, and sometimes even painful for your soul...you'll be luckier downloading it than trying to buy it...\n",
        "\nWell, this one is a great live album...and first of all i have to say (being this my first Death review) that Chuck Schuldiner was and always will be the father of Death Metal. I mean, you have to admire a man who had that kind of persistence to make the world know about his music and to break the boundaries of his musical style. The man never gave up fighting during his \"Mantas\" years to bring us the most aggressive and superb death metal ever heard. So, after all, Chuck went to a better place so rightfully deserved for him, a place where this fantastic innovative soul can finally rest, apart from the hypocrisy, the lies and the betrayal that this world had only to offer him (as we see in some of his lyrical efforts). R.I.P brother...\n\nThis is a hell of a live album, Chuck and his mates really managed to destroy everything at their arrival every single night on that tour (sadly the last Death tour). We all know that Death\u2019s leader abilities to surround himself with the finest musicians for his recordings were always very effective. The same members that played \u201cSound of Perseverance\u201d with Chuck are present in this album\u2026and I sometimes think\u2026this could be the most solid Death formation in their whole entire history. \nShannon Hamm always played his parts decently, showing us that he also know how to make some technical fast shreds, especially when being able to replace Andy LaRocque\u2019s parts; Scott Clendenin has his presence over here, this is a really great bass tone, I don\u2019t know what the fuck he used on that concert, but that bass just sounds really good, especially at the intro for \u201cSpirit Crusher\u201d and then Richard Christy proves to be a worthy replacement over Gene Hoglan. Ferocious drum beats and a pure appetite for destruction are his personal marks on this record. Very competent line-up gathered by Chuck\u2026of course, almost forgetting, the man himself make his impressive role as he always did, but this time singing with those anger high vocals like the ones in their last studio album. If you wanted me to describe the performance of these guys in one word, I would have to say: Devastating!!!\n\nThe highest points one this record are\u2026\u201dThe Philosopher\u201d( great riffs at that intro, classical Death stuff), \u201cSpirit Crusher\u201d( Great Bass, and also some great thrashing), \u201cTrapped in a Corner\u201d( Great solos, and also fantastic intro riffs), \u201cScavenger of Human Sorrow\u201d (Great drumming and an excellent song), \u201cCrystal Mountain\u201d ( Symbolic\u2019s best song, superbly executed), \u201cFlesh and the Power it Holds\u201d (long one, but a journey, not a bore), \u201cZero Tolerance, \u201cZombie Ritual\u201d (SCREAM BLOODY GORE, SCREAM BLOODY GORE!!!!!!!!!!!), \u201cSuicide Machine\u201d (Great ass kicker), \u201cTogether as One\u201d (Proving that \u201cHuman\u201d was their finest album), \u201cEmpty Words\u201d (Beautifully\u2026Destructive), \u201cSymbolic\u201d (need to say something else?) and \u201cPull the Plug\u201d (From the undeservedly despised \u201cLeprosy\u201d album, great finisher, brutal screaming by Chuck at the end)\u2026Well the highest points are\u2026ALL OF THEM!!!!\n\nThe production could be a lot better, because the title of the record really fits on the sound of it, \u201cDeath & RAW\u201d. Sometimes the drumming by Christy is almost eating the other instruments alive, but they still managed to create in those conditions a hell of a fucking sound. My only advice: Get it\u2026unfortunately it\u2019s a little late for help (due to this being a beneficial record with the former purpose of providing money to pay for his health treatments, since he didn\u2019t had a heath insurance), but it\u2019s a worthy item to get\u2026and a tribute to Death Metal, in it\u2019s purest soul: Live!!!\n",
        "\nDeath are one band nobody has anything bad to say about. They are just good. I can't get into their old shit as much, but anything Human and beyond is gold. Chuck knew his way around a song, and his ability really starts to show through on Human. There are no unnecessary notes here... just pure progressive death metal bliss, and some of the most talented individuals in recorded music.\n\nDeath were always a sort of travelling circus... Schulidner and whatever other guys he could pluck from Julliard. And he did some damn good pluckin, cos Reinert/Digiorgio = rhythm section from hell. Secret Face, Flattening of Emotions, Together as One... these songs are mind boggling when you consider exactly how nice the rhythms are. Not too fucked up (Scavenger of human Sorrow anyone?) or too accessible... somewhere in between. The bass ain't too pumpin, but i like that better than I like DiGiorgio's style on Swallowed in Black (all over the place and annoying)\n\nLack of Comprehension is probably my favorite Death metal song EVER... you can't beat that riff or solo. Some of the catchiness that was Symbolic begins to rear it's head around this point of the album, to much avail, since I prefer this approach. Cosmic Sea reveals Death's progressive tendencies and collective talent, leading the listener through astrails planes on the wings of a hypnotic bass line.\n\nDeath are the archetype for death metal, yet I have heard no band like them. They had an original and everchanging style that is hard to explain. I'll say this.... you =/ death metal fan if you don't have Human. Whoever got their panties in a bunch from that line, pick it up and get back to me later ;)\n",
        "\nFor Individual Thought Patterns Chuck Schuldiner recruited once again another line-up. DiGiorgio was still left in the bass but Masvidal was replaced by Andy LaRocque of King Diamond fame and Gene Hoglan (Dark Angel etc.) was brought in to replace Reinert. Both worthy instrumentalists but Masvidal's style of guitaring did fit Death's style better than LaRocque's more orthodox style of soloing. Hoglan on the other hand is a good replacement for Reinert and does an excellent work on the album.\n\nThe songwriting has usually been the strongest part of Death but I find it a bit lacking on Individual Thought Patterns. All of the songs are short but most of the songs tend to fall into the trap of being overtly technical. A very technical, yet boring, part can be repeated a few times in a song and since the songs are all quite short, the songs don't get much room to build up and gather strength. Some parts are pure throwaway, the whole In Human Form-song for example, and instigate only boredom. The songs also tend to wander in strange directions which sometimes don't make much sense in the context of the song. There are some killer material in here too though like The Philosopher or Trapped In A Corner.\n\nThe problem of the album lies in songwriting which surprisingly has always been the strongpoint of Death. The songs miss a general direction and don't deliver efficient enough a punch.\n",
        "\nThis album is a crucial album in Death's progression. Leprosy was still a very straightforward album but on Spiritual Healing the music got much more technical and slowed down quite much. Also Spiritual Healing was the only Death album to feature three members from the previous album. Yes, the line-up stays almost the same. Only Rick Rozz left the band to be replaced by James Murphy. Chuck had a real talent for spotting gifted people. The added technicality was something really new in the death metal-scene back then and also Spiritual Healing's intelligent, non-gore lyrics were something quite spectacular.\n\nThe album starts off quite straightforwardly but the song doesn't continue in that vein. More technical riffing, slower pace and more technical solos. The music is still clearly death metal. The riffs are heavy as hell and the drums pound like usual on the more straightforward parts. Bill Andrews isn't a genius on the drums though and the drumming isn't anything remarkable compared to say the technicality of Gene Hoglan or Sean Reinert. Also Terry Butler's bassing isn't anything remarkable or noteworthy although it is sufficient. The guitarwork and the compositions on the other hand fully make up for the average rhythm section. \n\nThe guitarlines vary from clear death metal riffs to maidenish twin guitar leads though they mainly stay in the death metal area. The riffs usually control the field but when the leads strike in, they steal the whole show. The melodies flow very well and have a really sinister sound to them which suits the otherwise brooding atmosphere of the album very well. The riffs are more controlled than on the previous albums. They have a clearer purpose and deliver more accurately due to Chuck's progression as a song writer. Also both Chuck and James are excellent solo guitarists so there's nothing lacking in that department. One of the most impressive solo parts is the tradeoff between the two guitarists in 'Low Life'. Partly Murphy even outplays Schuldiner. Chuck's vocal performance has been tuned down a bit. The lyrics are a bit easier to hear and he doesn't sound as brutal as before although he does some screams which remind me of the greatest parts of the vocalizing in Scream Bloody Gore.\n\nThe variation in the material adds quite much to the age of the album. Even after quite numerous listens, I find myself wondering what is coming up next. Chuck and co. have come up with some really great and unexpected compositions in here. A very underrated album.\n",
        "\nDEATH's latest album, The Sound of Perseverance, is certainly the finest Death album and the best metal album of 1998. Period. Words almost fail when trying to capture the brilliance of this album, but I'll give it a try. It's like the perfect Death album, a series of perfect balances - progressive yet catchy, simple yet brutal. It sums up everything Chuck has done on every previous album, takes it to the next level, and still manages to make it even better than you'd expect. \n\nThe song structures are much more involved than previous albums, making some of the songs almost like progressive-metal 'songscapes', but you never get lost in a swirl of indulgent technicality - the riffs themselves are to-the-point, visceral; you can sing riffs from songs like \"Flesh and the Power It Holds\" or \"A Moment of Clarity\" all day long. However, the blazing riffs or human-whirlwind drums on songs like \"To Forgive is to Suffer\" or \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\" still wow the listener over and over, making one wonder where Chuck manages to find guitarists and drummers with three arms. . . \n\nI could almost go song by song and write essays, but in the interests of space I'll just touch on the highlights: the opener, \"Scavenger of Human Sorrow\", is like the whole album in miniature - it goes everywhere without losing focus and still manages to say something profound. \"Spirit Crusher\" has some of the best 'hooks' on the album, and some of the best guitar arrangement. \"Flesh and the Power it Holds\" is simply a masterpiece of mood/feel swings - the opening minutes are pure sublime majesty, the middle solo section is incredible (Schuldiner at his best, easily), but they still manage to throw in a lot of fierce riffing through the verses and choruses. \"Voice of the Soul\" is a fantastic guitar-only composition, layered harmonies over acoustic/clean guitar strumming. \"A Moment of Clarity\" is my personal favorite song on the album - a progressive delight that covers more ground in nine minutes than most bands do in their entire careers (and has one of the coolest harmony solos ever recorded!). And finally, their cover of JUDAS PRIEST's \"Painkiller\" rules - quite a bit rawer than the original, and with more adventurous solos, but don't believe the crap he's been getting over the vocals - they totally rule. And so does this album. Get it NOW - your soul depends on it!\n\n(Originally published in Eternal Frost Webzine #5 and LARM (c) 1999)\n",
        "\nDeath had been happily plugging away down in Florida since about 1984, and this album features 12 of the songs they had written to that point. The total number of songs they had is unknown, but it is at least 30 - some appeared on the numerous demos Death had put out (six, I believe, before Scream Bloody Gore was released, including two under the Mantas name), and also rehearsals and live bootlegs.\n\nMost of those songs were brilliant slabs of brutality: awesome primordial death-thrash spawned from Slayer and Venom and Possessed and Slaughter, with the Chuck Schuldiner edge - and the songs here are a pretty good reflection of the old days, but not entirely perfect. There are some songs that could have been on here, and been given the decent production they deserve (most of the demos actually were decently produced, the problem lies more in their being hideously generated by the time you or I got to hear them!). Some of the stuff made it to the next album, Leprosy, but in general a lot never made it anywhere, as Chuck's songwriting styles changed and he decided to use newer material.\n\nSo pretty much, this can be viewed as a silly \"best of\" album: \"Death: the demo years. Greatest hits. Or, a random selection, as the case may be.\" It's definitely worth getting, because it is a highly influential bit of death metal, but it should not be the end of your search, just the beginning - the old demos are worth hunting down, because there are quite a few gems there that are not found here. \"Archangel\" comes to mind... it's on one of the '85 demos, but I forget which.\n\nOh and what review of Scream Bloody Gore is complete without a tribute to one of the catchiest songs ever... ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!! ZOMBIE!!! RITUAL!!!
